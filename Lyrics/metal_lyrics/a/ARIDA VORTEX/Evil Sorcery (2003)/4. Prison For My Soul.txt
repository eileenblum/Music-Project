Running through time
I keep my delusions
Days of my life are changing so fast
Visions of darkness infuse my illusions
All I have loved is turning to dust
There is no way to realize
What goes wrong and what goes right
There is no peace in my soul
There is no faith in my heart
I've got tired and I don't want to fly
I am lost in this cruel Universe
And I know I won't find my way home
And the world is a prison for my soul
Day after day my time's running too fast
Facing my life I see nightmares
Innocent dreams are fading in a sinful world
Now I can see that nobody cares
