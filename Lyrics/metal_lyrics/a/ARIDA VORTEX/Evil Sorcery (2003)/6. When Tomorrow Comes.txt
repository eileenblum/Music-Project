The end of the world is coming tomorrow
You've just got to take off you mask of doubt
Waiting for the next day I feel no sorrow
Look at this world - this world is mad

Following the unreal happiness
The best of the best have lost their ways
Checking yourself and checking your soul
Life goes on to show all of its sides
Wondering why we are searching for answers
Wondering why we are searching for God
Keeping the faith and keeping the hope
We want to survive on this Earth

We've got in our hands just one more instance
Just one more chance was left here for us
Hide all your fears take them to the bottom
It's time to wake up - you must open your eyes

Something happened with your dreams
Time has stopped now as it seems
Wake your conscience find the truth
When tomorrow comes for you It's COMING!!
