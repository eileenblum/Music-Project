Welcome to my unconsciousness
Where evil rules the game
Fireworks of emotions
Burn me up in flames
Animal instinct's nature
Takes me down the void
Slaved by an insane obsession
My mind is fading

[Bridge:]
In my dark world time goes back
And all the white things turn to black
Fear makes me blind - there is darkness inside

[Chorus:]
Beyond the horizon where I can't see
There Evil's sorcery is awaiting me
Roaming through labyrinths
Of my entangling thoughts
I cannot find a way out
That would give me a hope
Facing the growing madness
I'm losing self-control
It seems to me that evil
Lives inside of all
