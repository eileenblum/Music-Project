Do you hear the sounds of weapons?
New resistance has begun
We're the pawns in strange intrigues
Pawns in a game we've never won
Watching TV news we've no doubts
'Bout the objectivity
Masters of manipulations
They won't let us be free

Hostages of the empire
We pay too expensive a price
Dreaming 'bout a heaven
We believe in any lies

Revolution time, revolution time
Kill the slave in your own mind
It's revolution time

Politicians race for power
They decide our destiny
Hiding their own real intentions
They give us the false enemy
Don't you think it's a crazy reason
To proceed with this bloody game
Different centuries but the rules
Still remain the same
