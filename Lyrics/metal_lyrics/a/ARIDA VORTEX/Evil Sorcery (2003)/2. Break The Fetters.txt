Don't speak about freedom - there is prison here
You are in the evil kingdom its only rule is fear
Now you can see fortune's not by our side
But we've got a great force somewhere inside
Don't speak about justice - there is no justice here
Justice here is money - the money that is not clear
It's time to break out for one freedom cry
Join us and we can try
The time has come for me and you
To break these fetters now
And freedom comes for me and you
Until the end of time

Don't speak about mercy - there is no mercy here
Madness, fear, and horror - just look around it's near
Now you can see we've got nothing to lose
But we've got the power it's what we can use
Don't speak about future we have no future here
If we don't try to break out we will all disappear
It's time to break out for one freedom cry
Join us and we can try
