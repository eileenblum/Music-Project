I can hear the blowing wind under the trees
I can hear the whisper of the falling leaves
I can see the gray clouds flying in the sky
And it seems my life is slowly passing by

[Bridge:]
Help me now, hear my call, in the night, come to me
Look at me, set me free, set me free, heal my soul

[Chorus:]
Autumn - cold wind blows
Autumn - the season of tears
Autumn - cold wind blows
Autumn now I'm feeling you breathe
Walking through the forest on a long cold night
I can see the shadows playing in the moonlight
Stripped of all dresses nature quietly sleeps
Waiting for winter with its frozen lips
