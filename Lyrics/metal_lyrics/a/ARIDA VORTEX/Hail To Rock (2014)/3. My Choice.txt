A hard dayâs night, the road ahead
All good cats hiding somewhere
Weâre chasing shadows, trying to get
Just one more sound like prayer
Grey winding road, no place to rest
Weâre in the middle of Nowhere
And in the end the stage awaits
Thereâs one more place to conquer

Trembling like the first time
Hot sparks in your blood

Itâs my life to be a rock ânâ roll clown for you
Itâs my choice â Hey! Hey!
I know Iâll do my best it is true

Days pass in flash, the road again
New unfamilliar faces
It all makes sense but goes in vain
No chance to stop this race when

Always on the edge
Whole lifetime guaranteed

Itâs my life to be a rock ânâ roll clown for you
Itâs my choice â Hey! Hey!
I know Iâll do my best it is true

But given one more chance to choose the way
Iâd pick the same old song to play

Itâs my life to be a rock ânâ roll clown for you
Itâs my choice â Hey! Hey!
I know Iâll do my best it is true
