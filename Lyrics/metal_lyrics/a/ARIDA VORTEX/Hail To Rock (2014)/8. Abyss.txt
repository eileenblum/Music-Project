Can you feel
Can you share all my pain
All I know is
I wonât stay the same

Heaven wonât protect me anymore
I just need to pass this way alone

Long is my way
There is no hope but do not stop believing
Go till the end
Youâve always been taking but now youâre giving

Temple inside
Your soul is the only place where you can pray
And deep dark abyss
Where all these words you had to throw awayâ¦

I keep quiet
And I lost all my faith
But to you
I have something to say
(please allow me to stayâ¦)

Heaven wonât protect you in this game
Go on your way or disappear in vain

Long is my way
There is no hope but do not stop believing
Go till the end
Youâve always been taking but now youâre giving

Temple inside
Your soul is the only place where you can pray
And deep dark abyss
Where all these words you had to throw awayâ¦
