Itâs a savage barbaric dance
In the middle of the wild
A rebel song in the wind of hope
We are used to playing with fire
Walking on the edge,
Weâre here to challenge your imposter popes.

Rhythm of music to keep us alive.
Letâs keep on rocking all our life!

Hail to rock!
Raise your fire
Up to the sunset skies!
Hail to rock!
Flames get higher
Reflected in our eyes.

And we watch how the years go by
At the speed of light.
But weâre still here, weâre still the same.
Let them writhe and let them shout
That our time is out,
We are the guardians keeping the flame.

Somebody said that rock is dead!
But the guitar still playing come on!
Bang your head!

Hail to rock!
Take your fire
Up to the skies and back!
Hail to rock!
Flames get higher,
Weâre ready for metal attack!
