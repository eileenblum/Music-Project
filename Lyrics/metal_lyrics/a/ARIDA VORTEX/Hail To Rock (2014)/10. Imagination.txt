Iâm a lonely stranger
In this world Iâm living in
Iâm the one whoâs trying to reach the unknown

As proud as an eagle
Whoâs facing straight aganst the wind
I need all my minght to carry on

Iâm on that way again

Imagination,
Show me the place I want to be in
Imagination,
Break my deepest fears

Imagination,
When Iâm loooking inside the foretellerâs sphere
Imagination,
I want to see it clear

Whatâs beyond the curtain
That surrounds me in my mortal cage
Where Iâm playing game of flame and ice

I always knew when you watched me
And tried to hide my fear and rage
To keep it somewhere deep inside my eyes 

Iâm on that way again

Imagination,
Show me the place I want to be in
Imagination,
Break my deepest fears

Imagination,
When Iâm loooking inside the foretellerâs sphere
Imagination,
I want to see it clear
