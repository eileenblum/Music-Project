Tell me, Father, what have I done
How to play for my sin
Never surrendered when nowhere to run
Born to lose sometimes may win

Like a thunder that strikes into my head
New horizons of pain that drives me mad!

Help me, Father, Iâm losing my path!
My soul is tearing apart
My life is breaking, Iâm guided be wrath
Pain burns like flame in my heart

Like the judged whoâs guilt was never proved
In this rough game Iâm planning my last move

Till the candle fades away
I wonât turn the page
For this wisdom I will pay
Every wanted wage

On the edge of space and time
Where the Night and Day collide
I could find my piece of mind
Or just die!

Like the judged whoâs guilt was never proved
In this rough game Iâm planning my last move

Till the candle fades away
I wonât turn the page
Father, help me find my way!
Please, forgive my rageâ¦

On the edge of space and time
Where the Light and Deep collide
Mow I know what I will find!
