You! Who do you think you are?
Youâre just a pathetic foolish little clown!
And your world of stupid dreams
The only thing that youâve already done!

World, you tried so hard to build,
Is no more than just castles made of sand
You, you thought youâll be the king
And now you seek the strength to meet the end!

You thought youâre a lucky one
Whoâs born to win forever
But road to nowhere is the only prize you won!

What is your soul when befre mighty gods
Itâs only a stake in the game
But each little part of your flesh and blood
Screams â youâre a man, not a slave!

You always said
Keep trying hard â the prize will find you
But no one told you that youâre racing
In the ring

What is your soul when befre mighty godsâ¦
