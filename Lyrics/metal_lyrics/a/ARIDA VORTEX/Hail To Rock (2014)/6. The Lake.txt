I feel the moment when the water makes your mouth mute,
And the bottom waves caress your skin.
If I am ever asked what I trust in â I trust in you.
And Iâll be trusting you if you come back again.

I put my arms into the water cold and deep.
I know I have to go, I should go on and live.
My thoughts flash past like mellow leaves.
Whatever autumn brings, it never brings relief.

Here I am, looking through the mirror of the lake.
Come, build the sandcastle with me.

You walked into the lake like Alice through the looking glass.
You dream your cold dreams in the Wonderland.
Cold is the water,
Dark is the sand.
Build half the sandcastle for me.

And suddenly it all goes down on me:
The memory of the sun and of distant laugh.
I know I should turn, go back and look
In the eyes of the one Iâll have to love.

Here I am, looking through the mirror of the lake.
Come, build the sandcastle with me.

You walked into the lake like Alice through the looking glassâ¦

With meâ¦
