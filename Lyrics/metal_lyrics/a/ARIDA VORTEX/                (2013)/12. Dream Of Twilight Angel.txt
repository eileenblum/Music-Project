Light and dream
Day and night
Don't you try to hold the wind
Though you know it' s right

Trace of light
A world inside the word
Close your eyes and raise your wings
And hear the rising storm

Your twilight dream was born between
The Darkness and the Light
The human love and fight
A mistique colored taste of Night
And blessed skies out of sight
A million ways you've tried
To avoid your destination

Light
For you there's only light
Don't fear an endless night
It passed in vain forever

No cry
Your love will always shine
To ones you've left behind
To dream of Twilight Angel

To dream of Twilight Angel
To dream of Twilight Angel
Your dream of Twilight Angel

Light and dream
Day and Night...
