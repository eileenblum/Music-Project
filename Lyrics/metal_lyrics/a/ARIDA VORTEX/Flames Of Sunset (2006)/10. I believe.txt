[music and lyrics â R. Guryev]

The light of your eyes
It lights up my way
I will not go astray
Now I'm on my knees
And I cannot breathe
You are my air
I am caught in your snare

Rain is knocking at my window
windowâ¦
Just another rainy night

I believe my time will come
I believe the sun will shine
I believe that someday
We will meet again

When I close my eyes
Your image will rise
And I'll see your face smiling
To me with a good grace
Wherever you are
Too close or too far
You're always with me
You are my guardian angel

Rain is knocking at my window
windowâ¦

Just another rainy night
I believe my time will come
I believe the sun will shine
I believe that someday
We will meet again
