[music and lyrics â R. Guryev]

Running through the wind and rain
Feel the fever in your veins
Killing left and killing right
You decide who will survive
War is a bitch that's full of lies
But you do not realize
Slave is fighting with a slave
And only consequence is grave

Gear of wargame has set order
Who will live and who will die

You're not a sinner and you're not a saint
Now you're the hunter but later you're prey
You're just a soldier you don't want to hate
But you're just a slave of your fate

Have you ever asked yourself
Asked what you are fighting for?
Your hands sunk into a blood
Now you know that it's called war
Now you wait for the next attack
To get a bullet and lay back.
It will never strike the sail
Weapons will never gonna be veiled

Gear of wargame has set order
Who will live and who will die

You're not a sinner and you're not a saint
Now you're the hunter but later you're prey
You're just a soldier you don't want to hate
But you're just a slave of your fate

[Solo]

Gear of wargame has set order
Who will live and who will die

You're not a sinner and you're not a saint
Now you're the hunter but later you're prey
You're just a soldier you don't want to hate
But you're just a slave of your fate
