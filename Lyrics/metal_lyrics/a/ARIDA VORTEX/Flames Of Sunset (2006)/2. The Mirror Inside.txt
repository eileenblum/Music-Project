[music â A. Lobashev, R. Guryev lyrics â A. Lobashev]

Have you ever seen in mirror
Your reflection comes to life
Nothing strange and nothing should be
It's just a game within your mind
Have you ever though

Without you
The world would be clearer
Without you
It could be so easy to live
Can't you see?
When you're breaking the mirror
Nothing changes at all

Sky is falling, Earth is calling
Visions never were so clear
Crucified and everfalling
Into the abyss of your dream
Have you ever thought â

Without you
The world would be clearer
Without you
It could be so easy to live
Can't you see?
When you're breaking the mirror
Nothing changes at all

You could be flying high
Where the eagles never dare
And every time you try
Your life's thread's getting thinner
You know you could fly high
But there's nothing more
To share inside your heart
And you go further as you live on...

[Solo]

You could be flying high
Where the eagles never dare
And every time you try
Your life's thread's getting thinner
You know you could fly high
But there's nothing more
To share inside your heart
And you go further as you're live on...
