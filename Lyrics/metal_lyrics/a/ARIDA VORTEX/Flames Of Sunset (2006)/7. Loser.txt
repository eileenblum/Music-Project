[music â R. Guryev, lyrics â A. Smolianin]

Don't understand why it has gone
When your eyes are full of tears
When you cry but no one hears it
Something's waiting there outside my door
Something waits for me

Morning â when you see the red sunrise
Evening â when the Earth is cold as ice
Calling â I am calling out your name
Help me â I'm a loser in this game

She's my hope and she's my life
She's the one I just can die for
She's the symbol I have lost
It' too late, I've paid its worth

Something's waiting there outside my door
Something waits for me

Morning â when you see the red sunrise
Evening â when the Earth is cold as ice
Calling â I am calling out your name
Help me â I'm a loser in this game

[Solo]

Morning â when you see the red sunrise
Evening â when the Earth is cold as ice
Calling â I am calling out your name
Help me â I'm a loser in this game
