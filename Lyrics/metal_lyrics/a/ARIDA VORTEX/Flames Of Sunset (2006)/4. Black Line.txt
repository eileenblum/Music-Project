[music â R. Guryev, lyrics â A. Smolianin, N. âMarwenâ Prosuntsova]

When the night comes down, you're looking
Through the window and you're thinking
That you stand on the wrong side of life.
All your hopes and love have died,
Your friends are gone, you're wasting wine,
And this is only way to kill your time.

You're fighting with horror,
You're frightened of your dreams,
And maybe you'll wake
At the edge of a scream.

Day and night are passed in vain,
Living on you're wasting pain.
All can change, just keep it in your mind,
In a blink of an eye.

When the moon is shining bright,
And evil occupies your mind,
Dark images appear in your eyes.
All the troubles in your mind
Don't let you sleep and deep at night
You wake up, but that horror's still alive.

You're frightened of your self,
You're fighting with your soul,
And maybe you'll wake
At the edge of a fall.

Day and night are passed in vain,
Living on you're wasting pain.
All can change, just keep it in your mind,
In the flash of you life.

[Solo]

You're fighting with horror,
You're frightened of your dreams,
And maybe you'll wake
At the edge of a scream.

Day and night are passed in vain,
Living on you're wasting pain.
All can change, just keep it in your mind,
In a blink of an eye.
