[music and lyrics - R. Guryev]

Step by step we're going forward
And weâre never looking back
Here we stand strong and united
Always ready to attack

Weâll never surrender, weâll never give up
And we will fight âtill the end
Weâll never surrender, weâll never give up
Our destiny is in our hands

Flames of sunset will burn us all
We will burn but weâll rise
Weâll be back from the underworld
And break that spell of lies

Hand to hand weâll break the barriers
We will reach for highest stars
Hand to hand weâll climb the summit
There is nothing to stop us

Weâll never surrender, weâll never give up
And we will fight till the end
Weâll never surrender, weâll never give up
Our destiny is in our hands
Flames of sunset will burn us all
We will burn but weâll rise
Weâll be back from the underworld
And break that spell of lies

[Solo]

Weâll never surrender, weâll never give up
And we will fight till the end
Weâll never surrender, weâll never give up
Our destiny is in our hands

Flames of sunset will burn us all
We will burn but weâll rise
Weâll be back from the underworld
And break that spell of lies
