[music and lyrics â R. Guryev]

Just another day fading away
Nothing holds me here to stay
I'm sitting in the dark
I'm staring at the sky
I have left my past behind

And I just want to fly away
To find another way

It's my turn â I say goodbye
It's my turn â but I don't cry
My absurd life has passed by
It's my turn â I say goodbye

Light of distant stars calls me every night
Now I'm ready for the flight
Maybe somewhere there dreams become the truth
Without any fear to lose

And I just want to fly away
To find another way

It's my turn â I say goodbye
It's my turn â but I don't cry
My absurd life has passed by
It's my turn â I say goodbye
