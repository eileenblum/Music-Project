[music and lyrics â R. Guryev]

Lords of the darkness
have come to our world
They want to correct our minds
They came here to spread
their own faith by the sword
If you cannot see it â you're blind

Skies brightened up by the fire
War's knocking at every door
Heaven behind barbed wire
Thanks a lot, it's not for us

There's a riot in thy Heaven
And the mankind craves for war
There's a riot in thy Heaven
We don't fear the lords no more
There's a riot in thy Heaven
That's the price that masters pay
There's a riot in thy Heaven
Slaves do not want to obey

Lords of the darkness control every soul
They want to set up new world order
They want us to fear and they want us to crawl
But they forgot we are not crawlers

Skies brightened up by the fire
War's knocking at every door
Heaven behind barbed wire
Thanks a lot, it's not for us

There's a riot in thy Heaven
And the mankind craves for war
There's a riot in thy Heaven
We don't fear the lords no more
There's a riot in thy Heaven
That's the price that masters pay
There's a riot in thy Heaven
Slaves do not want to obey

[Solo]

Skies brightened up by the fire
War's knocking at every door
Heaven behind barbed wire
Thanks a lot, it's not for us

There's a riot in thy Heaven
And the mankind craves for war
There's a riot in thy Heaven
We don't fear the lords no more
There's a riot in thy Heaven
That's the price that masters pay
There's a riot in thy Heaven
Slaves do not want to obey
