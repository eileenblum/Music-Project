Do you hear the sirens calling us in silence
That's the bell for you and me
Hungry vultures laughing, gazing at the suffering,
At the human agony

You donât know the meaning of your own existence
And still donât see the point in somebody's ideals
Pushed down in cage with the crowd of believers
Who donât know
What the Truth really means

Falling down to the Unknown
Falling down to the Point of no return
Falling down you see the light at the end of the tunnel
And knowing there's no return
And no reborn

Such a perfect monster estimating cost of
New religion to excite
Scaring us with demons and guiding us to Eden
Urging lambs to take the Light

You donât know the meaning of your own existence
And still donât see the point in somebody's ideals
Pushed down in cage with the crowd of believers
Who donât know
What the Truth really means

Falling down to the Unknown
Falling down to the Point of no return
Falling down you see the light at the end of the tunnel
And knowing there's no return
And no reborn
FOR YOU!

You donât know the meaning of your own existence
And still donât see the point in somebody's ideals
Pushed down in cage with the crowd of believers
Who donât know
What the Truth really means

Falling down..

Falling down to the Unknown
Falling down to Point of no return
Falling down TO see the light at the end of the tunnel
And knowing there's no return
And no reborn
FOR YOU!
