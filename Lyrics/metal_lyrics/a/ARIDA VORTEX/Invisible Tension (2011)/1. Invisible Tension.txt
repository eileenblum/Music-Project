I see the ocean when I look into your eyes
A depth of green I know to drown in it would be nice
A perfect creature born in this imperfect world
I know all of your secrets that you kept untold

Itâs a magic rite
Donât know black or white

Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this storyâs so ancient
Ancient but every time itâs new

I feel your presence even when youâre far away
You are my star at midnight, youâre the light of day
You have two faces, youâre the angel, youâre the beast
I knew your love and now Iâm falling to abyss

Itâs a magic rite
Donât know black or white

Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this storyâs so ancient
Ancient but every time itâs new

Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this storyâs so ancient
Ancient but every time itâs new

Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this storyâs so ancient
Ancient but every time itâs new
