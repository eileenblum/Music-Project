I woke up in this morning, a cold sweatâs on my skin
Was that an evil warning or was it just a dream
I donât know where Iâm going like an insect to the blaze
A fine sand in the desert a stranger lost in space

Place where temple seems like Bedlam
Place where Heaven seems like Hell
Wake me, wake me from this nightmare
Come to break the spell

Wake me from this nightmare
Touch me by your breath
Fresh wind of the new day
Fill my heart with faith

Iâm drifting through the shadows, Iâm losing all my links
An old man in the cradle, a puppet on the string
I saw the ugly creatures that feasted on the wreck
I met the holy righteous that shot into my back

Place where temple seems like Bedlam
Place where Heaven seems like Hell
Wake me, wake me from this nightmare
Come to break the spell

Wake me from this nightmare
Touch me by your breath
Fresh wind of the new day
Fill my heart with faith

Wake me from this nightmare
Touch me by your breath
Fresh wind of the new day
Fill my heart with faith

Wake me from this nightmare
Touch me by your breath
Fresh wind of the new day
Fill my heart with faith
