Purpose is so crystal clear, the predictionâs exact
Patience is boundless, the strike is so bold and direct

The conscience is for the losers, and no mercy for the weak
Youâre a man and not a sneak

Building the tower of bones
You protect your business
Turning the air into gold
Donât fear to deliver first strike
In the race for profit
Donât fear to spit on them all
Use your power to control

Actions are rapid, your influence spreads like a storm
Ages go by but the hunting takes the modern form

The city is a jungle where the stronger will survive
Thatâs the rule of real life

Building the tower of bones
You protect your business
Turning the air into gold
Donât fear to deliver first strike
In the race for profit
Donât fear to spit on them all
Use your power to control

Building the tower of bones
You protect your business
Turning the air into gold
Donât fear to deliver first strike
In the race for profit
Donât fear to spit on them all
Use your power to control!
