Hello my friend, let me give you my hand
And let me give you a treasure
Lifetime goes by like a rain through the sand
Open your heart for the pleasure
I will teach you, I will lead you, I will take you higher
Iâm the guide whom you will follow, Iâm a perfect liar

Tumbling down towards the bottom
Youâre falling, but seeming to fly

It will be so easy, it will be so nice
Just one step to Eden - final paradise

Leave all the things of your past life behind
Now it has got just no matter
Do not be scared and just open your mind
Take it and you will feel better
I will solve all your problems, I will take you higher
You will rise out of the ashes up into the sky

Tumbling down towards the bottom
Youâre falling, but seeming to fly

It will be so easy, it will be so nice
Just one step to Eden - final paradise
