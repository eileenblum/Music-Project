I know that somewhere there
Beyond the seas of your tears
Thereâs a land of fairytale
Thatâs made of your childhood dreams

Take me to your secret world
Thatâs made of bright colors
Throw all your grieves away
Letâs paint the sky with flowers

Perfect private world
Someoneâs bought and someoneâs sold
Welcome to the business age
To your cozy golden cage
Someoneâs bought, some - sold
Your Perfect private world

When everything is lost
And it seems like this is the end
I let my spirit fly
To my childhood fairyland

I want to buy my secret world
Thatâs made of bright colors
Thereâs no pain and thereâs no war
Letâs buy off with dollars

Perfect private world
Someoneâs bought and someoneâ sold
Welcome to the business age
To your cozy golden cage
Someoneâs bought, some - sold
Your Perfect private world
