We haven't said a word since we woke up
Please, I don't want to hurt you I had to tell you the truth
I know you're the one
But temptation became to strong
The touch of his hand, his lips on my neck

I'll regret it 'til the day I die
But you never see me when I cry
I'll regret it 'til the day I die
But you never see me

I wish that I could turn back time
Turn right instead of left
I head him calling In a way
You never did

I longed for being that close to you
But you were never there
Believe me, oh
I waited day in day out

I'll regret it
'Til the day I die
But you never see me when I cry

I'll regret it
'Til the day I die
But you never see me

I want you to love but what's the point
Make me feel whole again
He gave me everything while you
Just pushed away
Your weakness and your lack of feelings
Ruined everything
If it wasn't for you
We wouldn't be where we are today

I'll regret it
'Til the day I die
But you never see me when I cry

I'll regret it
'Til the day I die
But you never see me

I'll regret it
'Til the day I die
But you never see me when I cry

I'll regret it
'Til the day I die
But you never see me

I'll regret it
