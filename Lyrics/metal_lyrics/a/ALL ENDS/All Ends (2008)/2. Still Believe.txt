I need to leave it all behind
Go straight ahead with open eyes
Surround myself with all the love
I deserve

I tried to help you understand
You need to breathe again
Don't let me down

Now I'm standing here and I know what's right
I see that you still believe
Though it's been hard it won't hurt no more
I always will believe

I'll try to find my strength again
Remember the times I'm grateful for
And never turn my back
I won't give up

You know I'm always by your side
Wherever you will go
I'm right behind

Now I'm standing here and I know what's right
I see that you still believe
Though it's been hard it won't hurt no more
I always will believe

I never thought I would feel this safe
Just feel my trust and I'll show the way

Now I'm standing here and I know what's right
I see that you still believe
Though it's been hard it won't hurt no more
I always will believe

Now I'm standing here and I know what's right
I see that you still believe
Though it's been hard it won't hurt no more
I always will believe
