This is it, you're on your own
Illusions quickly fade as reality danws on you
And yet you never learn
You keep on doing the same mistakes
This will be the end of us

It was the first time I realized
This is the best for me
We had the worst kind of understanding
This can't go on, can't you see?

The memories haunt me in my sleep
I will never get over this
You came into my life
I thought that you were the one for me
This must be the end of us

It was the first time I realized
This is the best for me
We had the worst kind of understanding
This can't go on, can't you see?

It was the first time I realized
this is the best for me
We had the worst kind of understanding
This can't go on, can't you see?
