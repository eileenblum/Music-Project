Who do you take me for?
You need to understand
You can't control me
And I don't have the strength
To listen to you anymore
I was down on my knees
And you kept on
And now I'm ready

All this time spent for nothing
Wasting life
I hate you for that

I can't believe you
You're still not listening
I'm done with being nice
It's over!
You can stop pretending

All this time spent for nothing
Wasting life
And I hate you for that
All this time spent for nothing
Wasting life
I hate you for that

And now I'm ready
You can stop pretending

All this time spent for nothing
Wasting life
I hate you for that...[repeat]
