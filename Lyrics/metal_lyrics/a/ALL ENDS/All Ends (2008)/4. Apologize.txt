[One Republic cover]

I'm holding on your rope
Got me 10 feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you say but i just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think i'd turn around and say(that):

It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new
Yeah
I loved you with a fire red now it's turning blue
And you say
"Sorry" like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But i'm afraid

It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'm holding on your rope
Got me 10 feet off... the ground
