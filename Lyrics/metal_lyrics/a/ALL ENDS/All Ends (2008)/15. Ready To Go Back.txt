Oh, it makes me sick just thinking of you(time to pay)
Remember your eyes Turning black every time they stared right through me Drove me crazy

And I'm turning around, I'm ready to go back again
You won't get away this time
I'm stronger than I've ever been
And when I'm done you'll be the sorry one

Oh, I've tried to make you see the real me (how I failed)
But your intention was always to make me look stupid
Wasn't it, wasn't it?

And I'm turning around, I'm ready to go back again
You won't get away this time
I'm stronger than I've ever been
And when I'm done you'll be the sorry one

And I'm turning around, I'm ready to go back again
You won't get away this time
I'm stronger than I've ever been
And when I'm done you'll be the sorry one

And I'm turning around, I'm ready to go back again
You won't get away this time
I'm stronger than I've ever been
And when I'm done you'll be the sorry one
