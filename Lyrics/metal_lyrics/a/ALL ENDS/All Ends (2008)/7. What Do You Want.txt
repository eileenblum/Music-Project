I turned myself out for you I compromised everything that I knew
Felt to unworthy and all for what,fo what,for what
All of the nights that I couldnÂ´t sleep tried to be all that you want me to be
Just when I think that I'm close you put me down it goes on and on and..
With no end in sight keep on tryinÂ´ keep on tryin' never seem to get it right

[Chorus:]
Can't you see I can't breath let it go you're suffocating me
I can't breath anymore I'm sick of yo tryin'to change me
I can't breath let it go I want you to leave me alone
What do you want..what do you want..what do you want from me

IÂ´m done tryin' to gain your acceptance loosing myself and I just can't pretend
That your words are not really hurting me when they are..and it goes on and on and..
With no end in sight keep on tryinÂ´ keep on tryin' never seem to get it right

[Chorus]

I won't live my life,live my life this way your words are poison
And they drive me insane IÂ´m letting go
I'm walking away I wonÂ´t change..

[Chorus]
