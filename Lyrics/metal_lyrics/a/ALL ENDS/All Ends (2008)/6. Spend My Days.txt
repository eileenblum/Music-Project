Why am I going this?
Just don't know
But it feels good
I know I'm not supposed to (I'm not supposed to)

What do you think
That I should do?
I can't help it
I don't even want to
No (I'm sorry, I'm sorry)

I have found a place
This is how I want to spend my days
I have found a way
I have found a place
This is how I want to spend my spend my days

Feels like I have found
Something different
Never been here before
I'm glad that I have found this, oh

I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I have found a place
This is how I want to spend my days
I have found a way I have found a place
This is how I want to spend my spend my days
