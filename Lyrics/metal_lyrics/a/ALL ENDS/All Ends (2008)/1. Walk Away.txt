Do you really believe in this?
And who are you to tell me so?
I think I've seen it all before
Well, that's your life, it's just not mine

You think you met the perfect man
But I sure will destroy your plan
I thought you were a friend of mine
How could you turn this in this time?
How could you turn this in this time?

Walk away
I did the best that I could do
I can't take anymore
You broke my soul

Walk away
But if I leave I won't come back
I can't take anymore
You made me whole

I'm not sure that I understand
You know exactly what I mean
How stupid of me not to hear your cries
'Cause you can't make it right this time
You cannot make right this time

Walk away
I did the best that I could do
I can't take anymore
You broke my soul

Walk away
But if I leave I won't come back
I can't take anymore
You made me whole

Walk away
I did the best that I could do
I can't take anymore
You broke my soul

Walk away
But if I leave I won't come back
I can't take anymore
You made me whole

I can't take anymore
I can't take anymore
You made me whole
