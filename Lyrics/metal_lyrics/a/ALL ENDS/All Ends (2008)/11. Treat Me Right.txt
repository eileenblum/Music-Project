I want you to treat me right don't try to hide behind your lies and I need to feel
That you think of me whenever I'm gone and every time it's hard..

[Chorus:]
I need you to stay just look inside your heart and I know you will find a reason
Not to leave us behind and give me all your love

You want me to know the truth but please try to see this through my eyes
You tell me not to be scared that everything's ok but what about when I'm gone
And everytime it's hard..

[Chorus]

I know you don't wanna hurt me but I can't tell you how 
I'd react if I knew
That you've been seeing somebody else when I wasn't there

[Chorus]
