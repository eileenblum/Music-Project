It's been a while
Since you left
And I must admit
That I've never felt so betrayed

And this time
I've learned so much
'Bout the two of us
Forever we said

What we say
It's that we do
I need to be
Close to you

The memories
We'll always share
But with tears and pain
You left me here all alone

The way we touched
Oh, how we cared
And yet we failed
You need to know

What we say
It's that we do
I need to be
Close to you

I've never felt so betrayed before
Memories filled with tears and pain
For what we said

What we say
It's that we do
I need to be
Close to you

What we say
It's that we do
I need to be
Close to you
