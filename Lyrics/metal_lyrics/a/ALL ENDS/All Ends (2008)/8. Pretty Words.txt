I let you fool me
Believed you cared
Pretty words misled me
How could I be so blind?

Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say

I swore that no one
Would hurt me like this
I feel for your lies no more
I'll fight for me, only me

Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say

Now I'm getting stronger
I'm starting to see now
You're not the one I thought you'd be
Just get the hell away from me

Pretty Words
Pretty Words

Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say

Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say
