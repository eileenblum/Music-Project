Everytime you called my name
I was always there for you
But when I needed you
To hold me an excuse

Now leave me alone
Just get out of my life
You keep pretending that we're ok
That's not true
'Cause we are through

I gave my life and love to you
I can't change what I've done
The past a better life for me has come
And I promise That you'll find love again I know you want it all to stop so Turn around and
Don't look back you'll see the pain will go away

Not a word you say is true
What do you want from me?
I believed in us for so long
I can't stand you anymore
'Cause we are through

I gave my life and love to you

I can't change what I've done
The past a better life for me has come
And I promise That you'll find love again

I know you want it all to stop so turn around and
Don't look back you'll see the pain will go away

We're done now I've had it
I promise you it's for the best
Just move on and you sure will find somebody new

I gave my life and love to you

I can't change what I've done
The past a better life for me has come
And I promise That you'll find love again

I know you want it all to stop
So turn around and
Don't look back
You'll see the pain will go away
