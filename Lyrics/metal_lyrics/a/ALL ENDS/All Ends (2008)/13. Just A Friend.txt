Oooh

Who am I to argue?
I can't change the color of my eyes
Do we really need this?
Oh, please just let me go

I wish that you'd understand
I'm not what you're looking for

I want to feel
But my heart I gave away
You will heal
And you'll love another day

I could never say this
'Cause to you I'm just a friend
You say you'll always love me
but this has to end

I wish that you'd understand
I'm not what you're looking for
We've tried this so many times
Now it's time to let it go

I want to feel
But my heart I gave away
You will heal
And you'll love another day

I want to feel
But my heart I gave away
You will heal
And you'll love another day

I wish that you'd understand
I'm not what you're looking for
We've tried this so many times
Now it's time to let it go

I want to feel
But my heart I gave away
You will heal
And you'll love another day

I want to feel
But my heart I gave away
You will heal
And you'll love another day

Who am I to argue?
I can't change the color of my eyes
