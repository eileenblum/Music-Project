I never wanted you to know
You said you'd leave
But you never did
I's time you ment the words you said
[...]
I can't stand you're leaving
I turn around

Close my eyes
I close my eyes
'Cause I see your face everywhere
want to forget the day that we met
Close my eyes
I close my eyes
'Cause I see your face everywhere
want to forget
I have to move on!

Fool, [...] I found out you still look at me with a smile
Oh, don't you need my eyes wide shuth
But you'll be the one living with the pain
You gave up too easy
I turn around

Close my eyes
I close my eyes
'Cause I see your face everywhere
want to forget the day that we met
Close my eyes
I close my eyes
'Cause I see your face everywhere
want to forget
I have to move on!

I try [...] how I get through this
Then I won't be [...] no more
In stead you're leaving
You gave up too easy
I turn around

Close my eyes
I close my eyes
'Cause I see your face everywhere
want to forget the day that we met
Close my eyes
I close my eyes
'Cause I see your face everywhere
want to forget (In stead you're leaving)
I have to move on! (You gave up too easy)
