Tired of being alone
I need to find someone that
I can relate to
Share my thoughts and spend my time

Everyone seems to have found their addiction,
a piece of time in the sun

Squandered the skills to utter perfection
Am I the only one?

Ooh, I'm empty
There's nothing left now
What once was me is no more

Thoughts running through my mind
and I wonder, am I insane?
Got a feeling something isn't right

I really want to find peace of mind
and face all of my fears
Dare to be stronger
drop this act and learn how to trust

Those who always were right by my side when
I didn't know what to do
I want to open my eyes
want to feel that
I'm not the only one

Ooh, I'm empty
There's nothing left now
What once was me is no more

Thoughts running through my mind
and I wonder, am I insane?
Got a feeling something isn't right

(in my fight)
Will I ever find my way
through confusion, am I insane?
Is this where I'm supposed to stay

Can't find my way
I just keep wondering...
what will become of me?
