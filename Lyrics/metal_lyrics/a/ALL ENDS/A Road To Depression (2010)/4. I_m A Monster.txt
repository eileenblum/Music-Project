A couple of pills for my aching head
what happened last night
ItÂ´s totally blank
Empty bottles are everywhere
And who the hell is that guy in my bed..
My darling demon is my only friend
- Here it comes..
But IÂ´m not gonna die..
I gotta get out of hereâ¦

Same old voice screaming in my head
- Oh, girl.. youÂ´re a monster..
Same old song keeps haunting me
Yeah, I know IÂ´m a monster..

Life has a funny way of changing oneÂ´s fate
Surrender to hell â I used to be whole..
Now I struggle through every day
CanÂ´t stop shaking..
But IÂ´m not gonna die
Divorced from reality
I gotta get out of here
Visions are blinding me
I gotta get out of here

Same old voice screaming in my head
- Oh, girl.. youÂ´re a monster..
Same old song keeps haunting me
Yeah, I know IÂ´m a monster..
â¦.help meâ¦

Help me change my attitude
to choose between whatÂ´s right or wrong
The voices that are drowning me..
..so loud, so loud..
Same old voice..

Same old voice screaming in my head
- Oh, girl.. youÂ´re a monster..
Same old song keeps haunting me
Yeah, I know IÂ´m a monster..
