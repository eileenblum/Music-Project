DonÂ´t be scared..
You know IÂ´m with you all the time
I know it hurts when life just seem
to fade away..
Please be strong and keep on trying
Â´though itÂ´s hard to face
DonÂ´t forget to smile, and then you
wonÂ´t cry no more..

See my strength and feel my faith
Helping you to fight the pain
Oh, I lift you up and keep you safe
And bring you happiness again

YouÂ´ll be OKâ¦
As long as you still have your faith
YouÂ´re not alone, Â´though it may
seem IÂ´m far away..
Find your strength in all the love that
is surrounding you
Never stop believing, youÂ´ll get through this..

See my strength and feel my faith
Helping you to fight the pain
Oh, I lift you up and keep you safe
And bring you happiness again

Find your strength in all the love that
is surrounding you
Never stop believing.. WeÂ´ll get through..

See my strength and feel my faith
Helping you to fight the pain
Oh, I lift you up and keep you safe
And bring you happiness again
