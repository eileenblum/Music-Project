â¦why, whyâ¦
A worn out word that people force
on each other
And what will happen if they stand
up and say â why not..
Take the risk, and grow up
Need to broaden your views
You wonÂ´t get no where asking why..

Stupid people
- never reach for the stars
Stupid people
- always turn back and then what..
Stupid people!
How can you live like that?!
- Why?!

Year after year same old procedure
And still they have the nerve to say
- Why me?!
IÂ´ll tell you the problem, man
then maybe youÂ´ll get it..
YouÂ´re like junkies addicted to
what used to be!

Stupid people
- never reach for the stars
Stupid people
- always turn back and then what..
Stupid people!
How can you live like that?!
- Why?!
