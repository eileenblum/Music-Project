How you can live with yourself
is beyond any reason for me,
and the rest of the world, I believe
I wonder, when all your thoughts came
to action where was
your humanity..
How could they stand up for your beliefs..
WhereÂ´s your dignity?

So, to act devastated and claim
that this war of yours
was sponsored by God..
Was that the only way to
defend your behavior
and still get away
No liabilities..
How could they stand up for your believes..
WhereÂ´s their dignity?

Now, look what you have done
Deceived and led them on a
road to depression
And what a mess you left
Scares me to death knowing
you wonÂ´t be the last one of your kind..

You said, a leader is someone who
brings all the people together
All you did was to tear them apart
CanÂ´t find words to describe all the
evil you caused..
And the lack of compassion and heart-
less when you..
..thanked your soldiers for wearing
the uniform..
Told them to remember true history..
No one wants to remember..
..your history!

Now, look what you have done
Deceived and led them on a
road to depression
And what a mess you left
Scares me to death knowing
you wonÂ´t be the last one of your kind..
Now, look what you have done
Deceived and led them on a
road to depression
And what a mess you left
Scares me to death knowing
you wonÂ´t be the last one of your kind..

You turn your head away
so you wonÂ´t have to face,
the damaged souls of the
poor and hungry..
You turn your head away
so you wonÂ´t have to face,
what you did to the poor and hungry..

No one wants to remember..
WhereÂ´s your dignity?
CanÂ´t find words to describe all
the evil you caused..
How you can live with yourself
is beyond any reason for me..
Forced on a road to depression..
