Today I woke up with a clear mind
Like nothing could get in my way
Sometimes you just feel what is right for you
Not really sure what might happen..

All my life IÂ´ve been trying
to never give up
All my life IÂ´ve been fighting
Always known what IÂ´ve got
Now I know it was worth it
IÂ´ve got no regrets
I will make it! I know who I am!

I canÂ´t believe my life has just begun
Finally I know exactly where IÂ´ll be
New thoughts are coming
I see my destiny, yeah
Sure I will make it â I know who I am

This feeling just keeps getting stronger
And IÂ´ve waited for this day for so long
IÂ´m done feeling bad for what I can do
Nothing can stop me anymore!

All my life IÂ´ve been trying
to never give up
All my life IÂ´ve been fighting
Always known what IÂ´ve got
Now I know it was worth it
IÂ´ve got no regrets
I will make it! I know who I am!

I canÂ´t believe my life has just begun
Finally I know exactly where IÂ´ll be
New thoughts are coming
I see my destiny, yeah
Sure I will make it.. oh.. yeah..

ThereÂ´s no need..
Â´Cause you canÂ´t hold me back
I really know it was worth it

All my life IÂ´ve been fighting
Always known what IÂ´ve got
I will make it! I know who I am!

I canÂ´t believe my life has just begun
Finally I know exactly where IÂ´ll be
New thoughts are coming
I see my destiny, yeah
Sure I will make it â I know who I am
