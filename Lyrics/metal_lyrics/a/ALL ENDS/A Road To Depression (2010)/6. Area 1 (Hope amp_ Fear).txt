On the way (on the way)
to your grave (to your grave)
you meet hundreds of people
with thousands of offers
Some ignored, (Some ignored)
some excepted
And your forced to rely on the
promises made of lies you
choose to follow

Life ainÂ´t no gift, itÂ´s where
you stand
Hope and fear goes hand in hand
Win or lose
Play the role that you need to come through
- NothingÂ´s free!

One day hot.. (one day hot)
Next day out! (next day out)
And you beg for attention you wonÂ´t
ever get in spite your attempts to fake it..
DonÂ´t you try to fake it..

Life ainÂ´t no gift, itÂ´s where
you stand
Hope and fear goes hand in hand
Win or lose
Play the role that you need to come through
Â´Cause life ainÂ´t no gift, itÂ´s where
you stand
Hope and fear goes hand in hand
Win or lose
Play the role that you need to come through
- NothingÂ´s free!

Pay $2 and go straight to heaven..
What ever choices the circle is closed..

Life ainÂ´t no gift, itÂ´s where
you stand
Hope and fear goes hand in hand
Win or lose
Play the role that you need to come through
Â´Cause life ainÂ´t no gift, itÂ´s where
you stand
Hope and fear goes hand in hand
Win or lose
Play the role that you need to come through
- NothingÂ´s free!
