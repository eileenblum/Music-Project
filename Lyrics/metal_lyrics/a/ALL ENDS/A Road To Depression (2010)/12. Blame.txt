[Bonus Track]

When I felt lonely
it was the only way
To satisfy my hunger
through my wounded vein
In deep frustration I had
to escape from my old life
built on mistakes..
Oh, I had to run away..

IÂ´m sorry for all the
pain I caused you
Where I was before..
You are not the one to blame..
I love you so..
I had to go my own way
Deep down you know
You were the one who saved meâ¦

Forced to recover
against all odds
Covered in glory,
didnÂ´t help at all..
Surrender, for survival
and break the habits
Addiction to grace made me
lose it..

IÂ´m sorry for all the
pain I caused you
Where I was before..
You are not the one to blame..
I love you so..
I had to go my own way
Deep down you know
You were the one who saved meâ¦

You waited for affection
Cried yourself to sleep at night
But you never stopped believing in me
Â´Though you saw my life
fading awayâ¦

IÂ´m sorry for all the
pain I caused you
Where I was before..
You are not the one to blame..
I love you so..
I had to go my own way
Deep down you know
You were the one who saved meâ¦
