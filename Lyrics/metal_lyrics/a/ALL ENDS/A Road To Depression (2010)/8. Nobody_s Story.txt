This is a story about a girl
A lonesome girl in a lonely world
Her only dream was to find the light
in this cold rainy winter night

A cold existence left to pass
Too many feelings are shaped like glass
Her only hope was an essence of life,
in this cold endless final strife

Nobody knows
Nobody sees
that this girl doesnÂ´t know who she isâ¦

She canÂ´t excuse what she does
TheyÂ´re playing with her feelings.
Is there somebody out there waiting for her,
Â´cause she doesnÂ´t want to live anymore

Nobody knows
Nobody sees
that this girl doesnÂ´t know who she is
She does not understand why nobody wants her,
or why nobody needs her
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
that this girl doesnÂ´t know who she is
She does not understand why nobody wants her,
or why nobody needs her

SheÂ´s standing now on a mountain in the rain,
and she does not want to think again
SheÂ´s looking down at all the small cars passing by..
Taking one step forward,
and whispers goodbye..

Nobody knew
Nobody saw
Even God didnÂ´t know who that lonely girl was
She didnÂ´t understand why nobody wanted her
She was all alone..
