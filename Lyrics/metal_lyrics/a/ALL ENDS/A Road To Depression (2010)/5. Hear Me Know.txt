I canÂ´t believe youÂ´re gone..
Yesterday there was nothing wrong
What the hell happened?!
Can somebody tell me
I want to cry but IÂ´m too mad
ThereÂ´s nothing left but being scared
The pain just makes me blind
How could this happenâ¦

Hear me now.. IÂ´m crying out..
It isnÂ´t right, I canÂ´t see clearly now..
ItÂ´s so unfairâ¦
You should be here to help me
see whatÂ´s right
IÂ´m crying out.. Hear me now..

They tell me in time IÂ´ll heal
But what they donÂ´t know is how I feel
Time is a failing friend
Keeps putting me down..
I want to sleep, but IÂ´m too sad
IÂ´m trying so hard not to grow mad..
The loving memory..
Forever and always..

Hear me now.. IÂ´m crying out..
It isnÂ´t right, I canÂ´t see clearly now..
ItÂ´s so unfairâ¦
You should be here to help me
see whatÂ´s right
IÂ´m crying out.. Hear me now..
Hear me now..
Hear me now

Someone, show me
which way IÂ´m suppose to go now
Guide me through this
Hear me now..

Hear me now.. IÂ´m crying out..
It isnÂ´t right, I canÂ´t see clearly now..
ItÂ´s so unfairâ¦
You should be here to help me
see whatÂ´s right
IÂ´m crying out.. Hear me now..
