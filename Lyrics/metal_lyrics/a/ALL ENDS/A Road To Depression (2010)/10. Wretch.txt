Slowly left behind
But given notice fast
Innocent falls the deepest
Fake promises, that itÂ´ll
soon work out
So go home to your family
and calm them down..

Now a shadows gone over him..
Poor and cold
Roam the streets begging â alone..
HeÂ´s doomed to a life in shade..
Feels so small
HeÂ´s so shattered, poor and cold..

Tears in his eyes
HeÂ´s like a withered rose
All thatÂ´s left is a hungry soul
Friends passing by,
pretending not to know
They just keep on walking
thinking â IÂ´m glad itÂ´s not meâ¦

Now a shadows gone over him..
Poor and cold
Roam the streets begging â alone..
HeÂ´s doomed to a life in shade..
Feels so small
HeÂ´s so shattered, poor and cold..
