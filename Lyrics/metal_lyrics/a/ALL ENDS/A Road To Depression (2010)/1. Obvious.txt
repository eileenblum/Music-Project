I told you not to mess with me
IÂ´m not like any other girl
But now itÂ´s obvious you never
heard a word I said
Knew that I was stupid thinking
I could make it better for me
trusting you with every detail
of my life

Then I saw your eyes..
CanÂ´t stand your lies anymore
You betrayed my trust
Now, thereÂ´s no goodbyeÂ´s or no tomorrow..

This canÂ´t be right
ItÂ´s just not me
I used to think that
I was strong enough
to carry on..

You know that every time we meet
itÂ´s hard for me to turn the other way
or even stop to say the things I need
to tell you
Time and time again you pull me back
into your arms but never
once give me a chance to see
whatÂ´s really going on..

I saw your eyes..
Now thereÂ´s no goodbyeÂ´s or no tomorrow..

This canÂ´t be right
ItÂ´s just not me
I used to think that
I was strong enough
to carry on..

So, here is were it went wrong
I stopped being myself for you
I tried so hard to move on
I stopped being myself for you
- Thought youÂ´d be there!

This canÂ´t be right
ItÂ´s just not me
I used to think that
I was strong enough
to carry on
