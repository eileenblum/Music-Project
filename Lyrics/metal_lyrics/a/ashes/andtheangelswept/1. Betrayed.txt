Go ahead and cry you have done yours
Don't bother to come back here anymore
Do it, Crawl up and die
We are here, to wave you goodbye

See the Light of God
Now it will be destroyed
Hear the songs of Angels
It will disappear forever
Feel the lust of love
The lust has now vanished
Can you feel the trust
As you are betrayed

The destruction of the human race
The earth is just a memory
Nothing left here at all
What is this, this is Armageddon

See the light of god
Now it will be destroyed
Hear the songs of angels
It will disappear forever
Feel the lust of love
The lust has now vanished
Can you feel the trust
As you are betrayed
