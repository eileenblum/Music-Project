One sign of seven for the day of malice
The time has come for us to pay our depths
Seek now try to find salvation for your soul
The final sign is soon to be seen

The son of mourning came
And stillness sang its song
The birds have fallen down
And the desert froze to ice
The rivers will be filled with blood
And the sun will turn black
These are the signs you son
Son of mourning spawned

A stillborn child will soon arrive
The final sign is here
Your flesh, your blood
Is burnt, you're dead

The son of mourning came
And stillness sang its song
The birds have fallen down
And the desert froze to ice
The rivers will be filled with blood
And the sun will turn black
These are the signs you son
Son of mourning spawned

In the eye of the beholder
I stirred in blindness
I look for evil
Searching for what's not there
What will it be
Only death know the answer
