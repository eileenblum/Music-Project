This is the final warning
Leave this disgusting shell
Now we know that this is it
Your body, your soul's hell
Here we are close to your eyes
Or are you too blind to see
Don't stay, release your blood
Cut yourself free

I have seen the war, the third and the last
The final act of the gods, they are fighting
Where there's no glory to win
Let the mayhem begin

Nothing but a big black hole
Reflection of a forgotten world cast shadows of unseen beauty
And a land once full of knowledge now lies in oblivion

Slaughter extermination and total destruction
That is the third war's introduction
By earthquake and thunder they ensemble
The gods' army is beginning to tremble

Terror spread across the world
Chaos came shortly after
To destroy the world so fine

Nothing but a big black hole
Reflection of a forgotten world cast shadows of unseen beauty
And a land once full of knowledge now lies in oblivion
Now it's just you and I
Playing our little game
Now one of us has to die
So the other can keep it's fame

This is the final warning
Leave this disgusting shell
Now we know that this is it
Your body, your soul's hell
Here we are close to your eyes
Or are you too blind to see
Don't stay, release your blood
Cut yourself free
Terror spread across the world
Chaos came shortly after
To destroy the world so fine
