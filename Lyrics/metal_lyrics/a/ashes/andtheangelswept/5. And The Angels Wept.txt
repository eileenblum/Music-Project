Suicidal sacrifice
For the unhallowed Christ
The red shall flow in pain
Slowly slicing up your vein
Betrayed by the Christianizer
You will burn in hell's fire
Step forth the creator
You are our traitor

You're the one that's not him
The unborn son of a fake he is
You should sit on the throne
The throne of grace
Your bride, she cried tears of love
The lust for love she couldn't have
Her wings are gone by lust in pain
And the angels wept

You will pay for your lies
Can you hear the cries?
Cries from your angels
Your work is done in vein
No more god will reign
Crush the holy spirit
Hate now control's your mind
Killing makes you blind
Soo you will die
Death, nothing will remain
They are dead or insane
Your kingdom is gone

You're the one that's not him
The unborn son of a fake he is
You should sit on the throne
The throne of grace
Your bride, she cried tears of love
The lust for love she couldn't have
Her wings are gone by lust in pain
And the angels wept

Suicidal sacrifice
For the unhallowed Christ
The red shall flow in pain
Slowly slicing up your vein
Betrayed by the Christianizer
You will burn in hell's fire
Step forth the creator
You are our traitor

You're the one that's not him
The unborn son of a fake he is
You should sit on the throne
The throne of grace
Your bride, she cried tears of love
The lust for love she couldn't have
Her wings are gone by lust in pain
And the angels wept
They wept tears in blood
Black blood of pain
They wept tears of love
Love insane
