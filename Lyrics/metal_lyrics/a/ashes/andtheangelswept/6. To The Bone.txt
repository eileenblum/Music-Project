A day like this
Never to be seen
A raised fist
Right up your ass!

Burning leather
And bloody spikes
Wrath and thunder
Right up your ass

This is the day of revenge
This is the day of rock n' roll

Face the truth
We're here to stay
Within burning tunes
ASHES WILL BURN YOU DOWN

We show no mercy
We play it loud
Hard as hell
ASHES WILL BURN YOU DOWN

Don't try to stop us
We need no rights
This is our style
Rock n' roll to the bone

[Solo:] Play for us priest of the mountain king

This is the day of revenge
This is the day of rock n' roll
This is the day of revenge
This is the day of rock n' roll

Do you dare to face this, asshole?
Are you man enough for this?
HAHAHAHAHAHA
PISS OFF!
