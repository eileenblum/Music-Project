A thing have woken in your heart
The lust for hate the lust for blood
Your can not hide from things you feel
You're stuck eternal feelings
It came to you a dusk like this
It twist and turned like fire
In the realms of broken faith
You're stuck eternal feelings

What is going on, it's from another dimention

I'm the one I live inside your soul
Beware your soul keeps turning
Fade away like in a twilight zone
A distance not to be for real
The things you feel the things you know
They are from me and they are real
I am the one that turns you faith
Around and round eternaly

Eternal feelings! Eternal feelings!

What's going on, it's from another dimension

A thing have woken in your heart
The lust for hate and lust of blood
You can not hide from the things you feel
You're stuck eternal feelings

It came to you a dusk like this
It twist and turned like fire
In the realms of broken faith
You're stuck eternal feelings

Have tried to get rid of this
For a thousand years or so
There's nothing you can do
You're stuck eternal feelings

When you can't stop for death
He kindly stops for you
Don't try to run
You're stuck eternal feelings
