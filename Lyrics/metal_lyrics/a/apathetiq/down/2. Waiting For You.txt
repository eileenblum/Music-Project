Can you see me?
Are you looking right through?
What is real here
I'm still waiting for proof
I can feel this feel you slipping
I'll be right here I'll be waiting for you
All I want for you to be just what a mother should be
But all I've got wish you could see it hurts deep inside

Can you see me?
Are you looking right through
What is real here I'm still waiting for proof
I can feel this feel you slipping
I'll be right here I'll be waiting for you

Far too young to be this strong but I had no other choice.
You open up this lithium it keeps becoming worse

Can you see me?
Are you looking right through?
What is real here
I'm still waiting for proof
I can feel this feel you slipping
I'll be right here I'll be waiting for

All I ever wanted to be was no more
That's all wanted to be

Can you see me? [X3]
Are you looking right through
What is real here
I'm still waiting for proof
I can feel this feel you slipping
I'll be right here I'll be waiting for you
Waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting for you
