I'm feeling stuck
In this unreality
Slightly out of touch
Now that I can finally see
What I wanna be
Who I can be
When you finally
Get your hands off me

I'm stuck on the inside
I'm crushed by your lies
I'm stuck on the inside
I'm crushed by your lies

I don't wanna be cold and I don't wanna be told
It's what I have to do so I don't fall
Keep my feelings lost and my emotions let go of the door
Make the time till I forget you
Oh
Till I forget you
Oh yeah
My hands are tied to this bed I'm sinking in
Even though I've tried (tried to see)
It only gets much deeper when
I swerve to the left
Ride to the right
Nothing left of me that's mine
On the inside
On the inside

I'm stuck
On the inside
I'm crushed by your lies.
I'm stuck
On the inside
I'm crushed by your lies.

I don't know how to feel like this
All I know now I can't resist
All you left me with
All you left me now
Is my life just to piss away

I'm stuck on the inside
I'm crushed by your lies
I'm stuck on the inside
I'm crushed by your lies.

I don't wanna be cold and I don't wanna be told
It's what I have to do so I don't fall
Keep my feelings lost and my emotions let go of the door
Make the time till I forget you

Oh yeah till I forget you
Oh
I don't know how to feel like this
All I know now I can't resist
All you left me with all you left me now
Is my life just to piss away
