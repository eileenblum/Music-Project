So Alone
You cry out at night
You scream out at the sight of me
I never meant to hurt you
I don't wanna leave now with these old views in my head
Cause if I don't leave now the pain will become too intense

And now you missed out
Our heads are in our hands
There's only one that we can choose

I don't wanna leave now
With these old views in my head
Cause if I don't leave now the pain will become too intense to bear

So alone [X5]

Sometimes I wonder why
This could not work cause once I thought
I could never live without you
Oh no

I don't wanna leave now
With these old views in my head
Cause if I don't leave now the pain will become too intense to bear

So alone
So alone
I'm so alone
So alone
So alone
