When you stop to ponder what's inside your past,
You'll begin to wonder what is for the best.

Well we've come a long way
But gone the wrong way
Cause down is nowhere to be.
We're falling harder
We rip apart now,
But no one can stop to see.

You can sell your soul but who will buy your sins?
With no self control you're surely pay for it again again

We've come a long way
But gone the wrong way
Cause down is nowhere to be
We're falling harder
We rip apart now
But no one can stop to see

You don't know what's going on inside of my head.
I'm alive again I'm alive again again

Well we've come a long way
But gone the wrong way
Cause down is nowhere to be
We're falling harder
We rip apart now
But no one can stop to see

You don't know what's going on inside of my head.
I'm alive again I'm alive again again
