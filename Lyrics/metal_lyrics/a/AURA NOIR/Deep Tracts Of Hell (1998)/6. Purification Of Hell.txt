Gates of madness
Gates of harm
I long for your endlessness
And to feel your blades

Vast sceneries drenched in blood
A thousand fires that reek of death
Halls of torment - let us in!
We'll show them pain

Night warriors, I summon thee
It's time for bloodshed
Come on and rape the daylight
I want whores and untrue sons of Satan
Dead

Eternal furnace fire-
The only light I need
No lambs of Christ could take me higher-
It's in hell that I must bleed
