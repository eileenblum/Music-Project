My heart sets afire the seas
The burning waves crush mountains of dreams
Eternal the fear of torture
Released damnation forever

Come to my shores and I shall crucify your soul
Feel the violent steel - Feel that Satan's won

And I am the wind - I'll blow through miles of burning souls
And through heaven's gates
Search through halls of white and chambers of gold
Then I'll kill you again
