I dream of you
I am drawn to you
I drink with you

You showed me black
I drank your blood
Then I saw the beautiful, darkest path

So feast on my flesh
Let me feel your flame and ride the stars with you
I am forever yours

You showed me black
I drank your blood
Then I saw the beautiful, darkest path

And as I walked the path grew wider
Infernal landscapes were revealed
I cried your name, knelt
Down and listened:
Tormented everlasting screams.
Guided by a savage serpent
And a thousand vultures flew with me
