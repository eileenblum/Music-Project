I've been chasing blood
Turned my back on gold
I have chosen black
All for you

'Cause

Father, this is my hell
Created with hate for life
The wars I have all won
Com march with me tonight
(with might (huh!))

Meet my love of life-
A wound open wide
I lick it clean with pride
Take me

Father, my blood is yours
Unite your soul with mine
Please don't let me down
Let me serve by your side
