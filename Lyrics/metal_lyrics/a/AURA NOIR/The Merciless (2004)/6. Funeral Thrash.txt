Rise!
It is our will to awaken the "Dead"
Crawl up from you graves
Rise!
It is our will to rid you of all chains
With these words, with this speech...
Death By Hell/Death By Thrash

Total destruction! Total devastation!
Armies of the "dead". World incineration.
Death by Thrash/Death by Hell
THRASH/DEATH/HELL/HAIL!

Funeral Thrash

Hate-ammoed funeral thrash upon you
Chrome hooves trample "God's" creation
Force-fed foetus puppets...
Of all that is holy
Blasphemed by thy name
All arms raise, praise the Goat!
Death by Thrash/Death by Hell
