Through the crests of open oceans
As the Heavens plunge the Earth
A soaring flight in breathless torment
Condor soul observes its birth

The dreaded dream as the claw grips
And you float...
Condor

Blue flame ignite the Black Sea
Let torrents crush the Earth
Opened chests, a scarred landscape
The sand that clenches thirst

The dreaded dream as the jaw snaps
And you float...
Condor
