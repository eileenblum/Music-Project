Intoxicate yourself
Be drunken without cease
Remembrance drifts in the frozen wind
The slave of hunger, now enjoy being free

Sordid grace
In a torn soul
Burns the soil
Expanding void

Fierce flesh left to boil
On the bones of my deliverance
Stench travels, crawls with the flame
Echoing through my mortal shame
All the pleasures I might have
Sealed as sparks in a dark gem
Unleashed as rage
Reborn as scorching flames

... eyes inflame the night
... eyes penetrate the light
... behold new forms of life
