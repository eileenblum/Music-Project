Troops are thrashing onwards
To rape all holy land
Seek victims as the Sun descends

Damnation is at hand

The sound of killing threatens the weak
Slashed wrists greet us, blasphemous fiends

We don't oppose evil...
We are
Merciless

Graced submissive rectified force
Raining daggers open death's doors

We don't oppose evil...
We are
(The) Merciless
