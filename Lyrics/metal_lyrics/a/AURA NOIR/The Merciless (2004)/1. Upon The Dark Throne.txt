Upon the darkest of thrones
The true God is visible
The filthy sound of ten thousand (necro) morbid deaths
Smear my body with your destructive visions

Writhe in my bastard hellish tormented ego
Soak my veins in alcohol
Create the beast.. behind these armoured walls...
I shall not let others in

So pure the race
So few
But we (tormented) know
We know so fucking well not to hide
Yet to stay underground

You, you sit upon the darkest of thrones
Yet still remain as miserable, as necro, as evil, as hungry, as I...
