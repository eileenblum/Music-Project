Soaring spell, burns the scattered spawn
Enraged journey, through Heaven's yell
As the wrath of Satan, escapes Hell
It drowns the waters, erects their waves

A wall of venom, amidst the jaws
The sacred heavens, slips through the paws
Of God's will, of God's grace
To the grasp of Hell, through these winds of rage

Black metal jaw
In a fierce grin
Black metal jaw
Grinds like a saw

This is the solstice, of a burning wrath
A steaming roar, breathing in lust
Glitters from afar, like a red death
In strange grace, in fowl hate

Like a vulture, in its sulphur birth
Its plunge is steep, in heretic speed
Through the narrow earth, its walls of sores
Into the claws of Satan's breed

Black metal jaw
In a fierce grin
Black metal jaw
Upholds the law
