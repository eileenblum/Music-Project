Boiling deluge sweeps the landscape
Seething waters rush
Elegant waves of devastation
Erects then plunge upon life

We enshrine this glorious black deluge night
Their pulse, in fear, is high
We arise, then flee back through the Gates of Hell
As tyrants, we escape from sight
Bereft of air, the Earth trembles wide
Cracks all mountains high
Soaring demons now swarm the skies
In awe and heretic pride

Black and vast in form and essence
The host of wretchedness within
Every holy aspect withers
As angels pave the way to sin

We escape this glorious black deluge night
Our pagan pulses blessed
We caress the inner ovens sheer delight
Of the earth that melts away
The filth of our minds await you now
It'll haunt you in Heaven's Hell
The praise of man has now turned to spells
Legions of the night
