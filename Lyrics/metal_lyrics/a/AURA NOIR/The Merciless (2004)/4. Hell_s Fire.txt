Sense destructive deathcore
Float amongst the dying
Strive to create spaces
Deteriorating realm

If only I'd been blessed
If only I'd accepted Christ
Well fuck, I enjoy starving
And I don't cry... I get to rape again

They crawl from severe flesh wounds
Yearning to see rain
I stand up cause I chose this
And I don't mind the pain

If only I'd been blessed
If only I'd accepted Christ
Well fuck, I enjoy starving
And I don't cry... I get to rape again

If I had known this "paradise"
I'd kill myself 10 fucking years before
The glorious flames, the tortured souls
The need to see the fires... of Hell

Hell's fire burn!!!
