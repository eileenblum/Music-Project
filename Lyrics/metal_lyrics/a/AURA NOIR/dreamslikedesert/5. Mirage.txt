A parade of ghosts brought these
innocent feelings to where innocent itself was brought to.
To view the rush of female tempests.

My Sculptured face
turns and twists by the sound of my own (horrid) laughter.
Awoken by the sight?
Ha! False lies have taken place in me...
(Words of lust heard from vast buildings).

That is the mirage you longed for.

So, amuse me.
Amuse me with the bitter glance in your eyes.
As I forsake you with my forlorn beauty.
...and expose to you, the garden of gods in my hand.

The glance turns to a gleam.

A parade of thoughts encircle my
throne and whisper to me, words of beauty.
And I caress these.

...and open wound in the palm of my hand...
The sky is no longer clear.
That is the mirage we longed for.
