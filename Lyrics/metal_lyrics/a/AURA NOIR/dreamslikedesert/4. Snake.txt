Sweet scent coloured these,
the realm of sweet snakes that tortured me.
If everlasting burdens should enter
such, as the everlasting torment of hell.

Sweet rape, honour these:
The souls of sweet snakes that denoured me.
If glorious destruction would embalm
such, as the moments carresed by enlightened ones.

"Even the earth can't grant us a common grave."
