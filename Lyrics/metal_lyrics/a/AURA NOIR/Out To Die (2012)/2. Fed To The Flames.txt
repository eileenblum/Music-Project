[Lyrics by Aggressor]

From this trench of sparks
The inextinguishable flare
The ascending fire
From the pulse of my veins
The dreaded strain
My heart is slain

A warped state of mind
Bursting eyes at the sight
While charred bones grind
Like a burning choir
My callous desire
For impeccable death

Fed to the flames
See me merge with hell
Fed to the flames

Sifting through my gore
Is your next chore
In the glowing cauldron
While my knuckles crackle
I'm free from the shackles
Of the toils of life

My face is a furnace
I'm preserved by fire
I leave this distorted realm
Towards the depths
Of the grasp of black
To my eternal empire

Fed to the flames,
See me merge with hell
Fed to the flames

Heat upon heat
For hell to merge with me
From the burning oak underneath
To the grit of my gnawing teeth

Heat upon heat
For hell to merge with me
The burning oak underneath
Is the key to my shackles
