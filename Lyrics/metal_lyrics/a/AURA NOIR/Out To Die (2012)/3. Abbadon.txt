[Lyrics by Dirge Rep]

Serpent scales and fever, cover the face of angels
The omnipotence of Hell
Black mist surface, the bellowing beast
Transfixed congregation

With razors, with will, with fire
Rabid teeth gnawing the cross
Break the bonds
The earth opens, vomiting forth

Like a gaping wound it swallows man
With its putrid claws
With its poison
Summon the end

A cold gaze, with sadistic intent

Deafening trumpets, storming winds
In every veil a demon, a flaming knife
The foulest stench
The foulest beings
Raping creation
All for the glory of Satan

Piercing the heart of the weak
Cleansing path of Belial
Expiating the throne of darkness
Writhing in pain with greasy self-pity
Self immolating clergy
