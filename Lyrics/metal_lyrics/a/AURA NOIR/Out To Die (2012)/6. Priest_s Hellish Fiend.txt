[lyrics by Aggressor]

Blasphemer!!

Leaving the dead barren fields behind
I'm on the prowl with the glow from my torch
Searing winds howl harsh and pave the way
Towards your parish adorned with stolen gold
I see your congregation of fictitious souls
As my dreaded shapes and shades unfolds
All the while, Satan's cloak, it covers you
In the fluctuations you call Hell.

This be your realm
Your sanctuary
But I am here
Priest's Hellish Fiend
[x2]

Crawl through the hallways
I've displayed your daughters' heads
Covered in the juices of my lust

Creep towards the gallows
Your brothers there, swaying
From my ropes woven with their entrails

Priest's Hellish Fiend [x2]

I'll carve a new cross unto your face
I've carved my commandments on your back
I will serve your sons' blood from your scalp
As I drizzle salt onto your skinless skull
Alive, raped and ravished by the hounds of hell
Crazed by the viciousness displayed
Through the black forces that dwell in this domain
The glare of Satan's power has prevailed
