[lyrics by Dirge Rep]

Saluting the night with spiritual weapons
Ice cold prayers
Hating the spirit of the feeble
Adorning the circle with the totems of your enemies
Capturing the essence of their being
Move at command
Relentless mental exhaustion

Captor of Chaos
Slow death
Terminate the living
Seekers of the undead

Vicious vials, a secret spell
Seals from the darkest of powers
Cast from the bowels of Hell
Slain, beaten, bereft of life
Mesmerizing choir of bloodgargling

Demons rise, the witching hour
Uncoiling the call of possession
The power of the unclean spirit
Invasive reek of death

Flames tonguing the scripture
Verses of blasphemic truth
Megalomanic rupture
Trampled by boot, hordes of light
Come eternal night

Aggressor â Vocals, Guitars
Apollyon â Vocals, Bass, Drums
Blasphemer â Guitars
