[lyrics by Aggressor]

I am the blazing heart of the canyon
Brandishing visions of cults
I behold the secret sparks
Like esoteric flames from a grave

Grasp the untamed snake
And wield it before me
I'll stand tall while I read your dreams
Leaving impressions of blasphemic cruelty

...from a remorseless realm of pain
I'm in the grin from the gallows
Where all my furies are howled
A spectrum of primal rage

I lead the procession
...through the flames
I'm the ruler of their grasping limbs

Drifting into the last war
A realm governed by Satan's scorn
Only unseen things are remembered
Pungent and harsh, great fears piercing your souls

Grasp the untamed snake
And wield it before me
I'll stand tall and degrade your dreams
Leaving impressions of impiety

I am the blazing heart of the valley
Flaunting a glimpse of despair
I behold the secret sparks
Like the hidden flames of Hell

Turn loose the feral beasts
And lead them towards me
I'll stand tall while I pervert your dreams
Echoing from the gallows
