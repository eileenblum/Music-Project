[Lyrics by Apollyon]

First kill-winterdeath
With silence she fell
White funeral
Freeze

Long did you wait
For insanity's tomb
With all your heart
Unleashed doom

Razorsharp chants
Blackens your skull
Forcing you down towards hell
And the shadows you dread

Be the survivor
In need of no sun
Embrace demons envision the dead

Corpselike cold
Mesmerizing hands
Touching your fear
...of the obscure

Ride the night
With vicious lust
Strive to die
To serve

Grant your life
To reluctant minds
Infernal deeds are ripe
Awaiting you

Ride the night
At any cost
Join with those in black
The sordid few

Take from us the cross of sin
Let the sinister begin
Spread the branches and you'll see
The land is plagued by me

Leave your dreams upon this night
We have sworn to take your side
The break of dawn it will show you
That troops from hell are due
