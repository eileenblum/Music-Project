Coiled embalmed
wretched face of evil
Lies sinned and furied, in spite of it's glory
All matters sewn into one prophet
I nail this one seed, and crawl back through it's onset
Winged lashes - vast essence
Dead skin holds the poet
A simple red mask keeps the rain from the sunset
A triangular wave left me covered with lies
Essential for it's beauty as the shepherd dies
All - fallen enslaved
All - vanished awoken
It's eyes may seem dreamy but soon lies a token
That buries three hearts, six feathers
- One oaken
To crack self-made concepts
To hold one great feast
A soak-wet cold fairy gave birth to the beast
My sins turns to flowers as the rain turns to dust
Please shower my mind in your ghostlike lust
...it's a fistful must...
