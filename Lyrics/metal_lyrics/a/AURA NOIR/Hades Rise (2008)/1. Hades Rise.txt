Heavens burn, rise, restless pestAs all learns Hades final testFire lurks behind each black crestHades race, rise, never rest Spitting blood on the barren landCorpses lying dead on the black sandDeep red, the core of the willOn the scrap heap, feel the polar chill Hades rise!!!Hear its thunder roarHades rise!!!Hear the wind of sin cry See the devastation, hear the bestial noiseThe jaws are gaping, roaring hellish voiceAs the eye of war stares impatientlySavage bastards prowl through the debris The bones are soaked, the blood flows like a riverYou're drenched in fear and your limbs shiverA black flag is on my mastThe cannons creep, the human race won't last Hades rise!!!Hear its thunder roarHades rise!!!Silently, as I sore
