See the jackals lurking under, the full moon's black shadowThe burning mind is fuelled, see the thick blinding fumesFallen under the gods of steel, see that death cast sorrowThe debris dropped upon the earth; know there is no hope for rebirth Shadows of deathTake your last breathShadows of death See the vultures soaring over, your crippled remainsHear the echoes from the womb, the calls from the frozen wombThe misty perfect night, under all the cold stars The death that takes all your soul, is blind to all woes Shadows of deathTake your last breathShadows of death Life slips away through the black nightFluently towards the dark red nightThe horror, the blur, the blinding frightThe gates are closed, blocking your sight Limbs lie scattered, and death crawlsVisions of torture and terrorThe shadow of death now ending this dreamWhat's left, the echoes of your screams
