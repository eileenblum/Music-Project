Sepulchral grasp holdsA cold grip on your soulClaustrophobic valutRavishing end now unfolds  The haunting void roarsSurrounds your severed heart's contourshe shine of your exustenceFloating aimlessly through Death's maze Gaping graves awaitsWooden coat embrace The scent of (the) Reaper's BreathCoils around your neckThe sounds of soilThat hits your coffin door The lid's closed foreverThe vacuum of Death's wombThe hinges are corrodingOblivion's pendulum swaying Gaping graves awaitsWooden coat embrace Gaping graves awaitsWooden coat embrace
