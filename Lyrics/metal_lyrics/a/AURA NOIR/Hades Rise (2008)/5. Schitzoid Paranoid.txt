Alone, abandoned and possessedThe wounds they ache, there is no restCryptic life, decay March to die, born suicidalFrom the womb, deny survivalSanity slips away Within my graspI know I'm nearThis heart will lastI cannot bear My aching tortured soul shall riseReborn through scorn (and) abrasive criesThe end is my domain See the smoke I've left behindToxic fumes blow down the lineIn my void I dwell Within my graspI know I'm nearThis heart will lastI cannot bear
