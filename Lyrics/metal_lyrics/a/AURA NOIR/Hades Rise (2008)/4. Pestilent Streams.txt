From the nest of tonguesOut of the salivary glandsPestilent waters are streaming againAnd the stream becomes a floodThat swamp and castrates the fieldsWhere you cultivate and reapYour deliverance and affluence Adorned, the nightBy the pestilent stream Twin darknessThey carry youOn no other pathNo other path than that of death See the tongues of the dark flickerSee the pestilent streamThe weakening gleam of your eyes reflectIn the torrents of the storm Stare into the voidStare onto the once black soilThe glare of your eyes infectBy the torrents, the torrents of the streams Twin darknessThey carry youOn no other pathNo other path than that of death
