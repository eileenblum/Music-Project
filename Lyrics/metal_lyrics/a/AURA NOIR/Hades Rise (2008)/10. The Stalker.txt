You see a figure in the mirrorAn eerie abstract figureEyes ignite, like cold blue fireNow you know your future's desire The realm in which you've wanderedSafe heaven, but nor you wonderIs this life, granted to youA grave opens, is it really true The stalker, the stalkerThe stalker, the stalkerThe stalker, the stalkerThe stalker, the stalker You walk the streets as darkness fallsbut the dreaded voice it callsThere behind a is a faint black shadowThe fear travels right through your marrow I can see the fright, it wandersAcross the bones on your faceI lift my blade as the thunderCracks through and crushes all grace The stalker, the stalkerThe stalker, the stalkerThe stalker, the stalkerThe stalker, the stalker Watch out!!! It might have dawned on youAs all your (night)mares come trueThat your very birth was a blunderAll your fortunes I plunder You are on murderous groundSee the limbs scattered aroundMy mind is filled with hateThe last stab, I just can't wait
