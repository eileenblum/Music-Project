In the Streams of Open Death - is it clearer???Do you know the devils pace - is it near you???The dust lays cold Hades awaitsIce burn your skin closer to deathThe ancient rise to crave on your soul In Dreams of Blasphemy we bathe November dawnThe flesh is bitter sweetthe flesh that I willkill ride winged Satanistfight wars elitiststeel claw rips your skinthe pure clean cut...wins I sin when I want SatanI feel no more painthis fortified cunt Satan, I intend NOT to pay The dust lays cold Hades awaitsIce burn your skin closer to deathThe ancient rise to crave on your soul In Seas of Blasphemy we bathe November dawnThe flesh is bitter sweetthe flesh that I willkill
