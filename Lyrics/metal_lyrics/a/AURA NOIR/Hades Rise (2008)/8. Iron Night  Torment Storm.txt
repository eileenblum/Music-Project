A scorching dark layerAttaches to the skin like leaches scratchingInside the open wounds they prayTheir jaws are open, their tongues pave their wave A pile of limbs, death's caressA vile scent drawn through each breathSee the crests on the path to the fieldsThe black desert, the concave shields Iron night, the end forlorn, nothing's strangerTorment storm. Exposed to direct danger Cavities in the horizonThe clamor echoes endlesslyClaw-marks printed in the sandThe torment storm has erased the land Gasses blur the visionsToxic lives inside the woundsBlister gather like blood clotsPungent sores, the flesh does rot
