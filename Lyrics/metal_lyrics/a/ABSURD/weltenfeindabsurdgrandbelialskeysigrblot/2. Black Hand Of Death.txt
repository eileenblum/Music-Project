Behold the very old man
Who is drawing the last breath
He gave up all the useless fear
Of the black hand of death.

Look at the splendid beauty
Who is yet rotting from within,
She dated death not long ago
When she indulged in sin.

Watch the murder victim
Who is struggling to stay alive,
Resistance will be futile though
It's butchered by the knife.

Listen to the prayers
Intended to turn away
The shadow of the grim reaper
Who has but come to stay.

From his stranglehold
You can not run and hide
The reaper will harvest your life
He will not be denied.
