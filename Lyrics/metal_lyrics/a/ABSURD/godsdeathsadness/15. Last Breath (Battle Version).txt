In the Dawn we stand on the battleground,
sword by the side, feel the hammers' pound.
Drink our last wine, we are taking our horses.
Awaiting our enemies, feel no remorse.

No fear inside, make your last prayer,
Dark Lord shall be for us care
fully shall help us, save us as
we have to take our last breath.

At the castle sits my wife,
to see her again I fight 'til the knife.
I have no mercy with the Christian scumdogs,
I hack their bodies and break their necks.

No fear inside, make your last prayer,
Dark Lord shall be for us care
fully shall help us, save us as
we have to take our last breath.

The battle is raging, the blood flows in streams,
oppress your fear when hearing the deathscreams.
If you want to see the sun going down â fight!!!
We are protected by the Dark Lord's crown.

No fear inside, make your last prayer,
Dark Lord shall be for us care-
fully shall help us, save us as
we have to take our last breath.

A friend stands before me and falls broken-dead,
in raging wrath I cut off the Christians' head.
I don't want to die here, I want the victory,
I wanna live and win, my sword is deathdoor's key.

No fear inside, make your last prayer,
Dark Lord shall be for us care
fully shall help us, save us as
we have to take our last breath.

The battle has now ended, we stand in twilight's shine,
our swords are blood-red colored, awaiting Dark Lord's sign.
Riding back to castle and have a great black feast,
black orgy with my wife and friends â Hail to Dark Lord, the apocalyptic beast!
