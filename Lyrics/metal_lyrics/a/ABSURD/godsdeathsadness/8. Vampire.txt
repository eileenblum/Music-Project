will return
I'm a creature of the night
I am a vampire
And I bite
At night I will come to your house

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourself

I will bite into your neck
To suck your blood
Out of your vein
Soon you will be dead

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourself

Stick a pale into my heart
Then you have saved of your life just a part
Hear my evil symphony

Lay me into my grave
And close my casket
To save yourself
