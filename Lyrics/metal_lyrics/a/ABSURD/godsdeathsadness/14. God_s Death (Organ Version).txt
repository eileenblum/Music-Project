Die by the demon, die by my hand
God is so mightless - I can't understand

Satanic laughter fills your ears
Did you ever so what hear
Your brain explodes, i suck your blood

Your body - rotting in the mud
You can't stop the great ABSURD
Know that the truth sometimes hurts

The truth is that God soon will die
Although he is the almighty
He's got the might to die himself
The creation raises against its creator
