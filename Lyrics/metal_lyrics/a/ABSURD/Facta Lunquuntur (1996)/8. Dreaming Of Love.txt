Your soul is calling me
I see the fullmoon high above!
I am closing my eyes and I'm dreaming of your love!

You're so far away from me
I am pain and agony,
And you think that between us stands my belief
You're right with this, we're both alone, tell me - what shall I do!
Forever I am Satans son, for ever I love you.

I love you, I look up, see you in heaven high above
It hurts, It hurts, I close my eyes... I'm dreaming of your love!
Take me as I am as I will take you as you are
Sign of your love, infinity, wazing up in dark

My trial has been without success, forever Satans son
And you, daughter of God - in my dreams we live as one

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of your love!
I love you! I am dreaming, dreaming of your love!
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of your love! I love you! I am dreaming! Dreaming!
