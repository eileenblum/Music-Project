There was a night - the only night which was real
I felt like the chosen one
But there was no thunder, there was no lightning
So I thought I were dreaming on

[Chorus:]
Straight on through the gates of heaven
Evil will destroy the souls
Where's your saviour, where hides Jesus
Why isn't he at war against us

Darkness around us was so siezable
Black blood running through my veins
We know: what we did was unacceptable
But our hearts were by evil love chained
