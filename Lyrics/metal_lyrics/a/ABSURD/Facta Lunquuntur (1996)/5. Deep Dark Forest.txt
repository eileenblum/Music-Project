The sky is clear and the moon shines bright
The stars look through the trees
The night is black and the snow is white
All things seem to have deceased
The glowing eyes of animals around: staring at me
The cold wind blows into my face
Like fire does it seem

Full moon shining silvern down
The day shall never come
My tears are running from my eyes
My blood pearls from my arms
I am immortal, i can't die but I will feel sweet pain
My eyes are red, my hair is black
Black are my fingernails

Eternal deep dark forest
Eternal is the night - Deep dark forest eternally

The sun rises up, I flee the light
The forest's hiding me
But winter is, the days are short
and dark are all the trees
The sun goes down; the twilight comes followed by the night
Silent stands the deep dark forest and the moon shines bright

Eternal deep dark forest
Eternal is the night - Deep dark forest eternally
