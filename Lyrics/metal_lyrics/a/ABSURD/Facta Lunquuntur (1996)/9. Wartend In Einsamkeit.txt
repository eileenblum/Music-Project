[Waiting In Isolation]

Solitude
When does the loneliness end?
I am awaiting death in darkness for I'm alone.
In Solitude I want my life's end.

Where are you my wife to see my blood running out of me?
Where are you to feel my final breath?
Feel my love and hate me now for I am just pain for you.
Hate me and cover me with death.

I would rather be with you, be an father to my son.
The same black blood does run in our veins.

Liebe und Glaube und Hoffnung und Dunkelheit.
Luzifer, oh bringe mir dein Licht!
Mich friert, ich bin einsam, sehne mich nach meinem Weib.
Tod, warum ereilst du mich denn nicht?

[Translation of the German Part:]
Love and Faith and Hope and Darkness.
Lucifer, oh bring me your light!
I'm cold, I'm alone and I languish for my wife.
Death, why don't you come and take me?
