Colours of Autumn
Fiery woods and golden trees
Are glittering beneath clear sky
Silver mist at every morning
And lonely ravens scream up high

Beholding the great vast forest
I can see the colours of autumn
Nightly frost that made flowers withered
Is silent messenger of whole life's doom

Melancholy mood within nature
I feel cool touch of upcoming snow
Which is born somewhere in North
Northernmost at the end of the rainbow

The burning colours of autumn
Such a beautiful garment for death
Last flashing of once vitality
But already is to feel dying breath

Not long within further time
All what I see is in the grip of frost
That's the eternal circle of birth and death
But still I enjoy what soon shall be lost
The everlasting colours of autumn
