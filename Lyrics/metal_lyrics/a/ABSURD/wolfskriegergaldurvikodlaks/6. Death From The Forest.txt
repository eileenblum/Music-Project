Death from the Forest
We will march - Death from the Forest
We will end God's foolish reign
Rising up - Death from the Forest
Our swords hack human brain

Forest this is our Kingdom
Here we dwell like animals
Only wanted life in freedom
But the humans hunted us

Battleaxe and Sword and Hammer
With these weapons Death we bring
Punishment, we will defend us
Take their fucking scalps and skins

Carnage, brains and broken bones
Get rid of the human scum
Burn! Burn! Burn! left only in ruins
Celebrate the revenge we've done
