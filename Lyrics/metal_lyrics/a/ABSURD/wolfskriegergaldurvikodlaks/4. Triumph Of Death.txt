Triumph of Death
Human beings are so mortal
It's easy for me to take you life
I suck the soul out of your body
My hunger you will not survive

Subhuman scum you must fear me
It's time to say goodbye
You have no reason to exist
It's time for you to die

[Chorus:]
I am the death - die on your knees!
I am the death - come with me!
I am the death - you are so mightless
I am the law, it's the triumph of death!

But if you're great warrior
And die in raging fight
I'll bring you to Walhalla
To sit at Odin's side
