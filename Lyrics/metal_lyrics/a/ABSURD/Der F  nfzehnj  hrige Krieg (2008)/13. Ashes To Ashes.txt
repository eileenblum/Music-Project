A somber funeral - cold rain's falling down, when the coffin is thrown into the ground. Around the grave stand the deceased's friends, while drunk priest screams out of unholiness.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death. Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.

Jesus has wept upon his cross, while Satan mocks God, the "Big Boss". A vampire rises up from his grace, summoned forth by a drunk priests' unholiness.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death. Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.

The cross has just broken, Jesus is dead, my sword hacks down unto my enemies' head. The pope has died and the Vatican burnt down, Jesus will never wear his golden crown.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death. Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.

The battle has ended, a life in peace begins. The Christians are punished for their bad sins. Punished by true evil and tortured with pain, in Hell where Dark Lord forever reigns'.

Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death. Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death. Earth to dirt, ashes to ashes and dust to death.
