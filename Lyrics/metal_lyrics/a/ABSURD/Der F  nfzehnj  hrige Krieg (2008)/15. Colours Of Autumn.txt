Fiery woods and golden trees are glittering beneath clear sky. Silver mist at every morning and lonely ravens scream up high. Beholding the great vast forest. I ean see the colours of autumn. Nightly frost that made flowers withered is silent messenger of whole life's doom.

Melancholy mood within nature. I feel cool touch of upcoming snow, which is born somewehre in North. Northernmost at the end of the rainbow. The burning colours of autumn, such a beatuiful garment for death! Last flashing of once vitality, but already I can feel dying breath. Not so long within further time is all what I see the grip of frost. That's the eternal cycle of birth and death.

Fiery woods and golden trees are glittering beneath clear sky. Silver mist at every morning and lonely ravens scream up high. Beholding the great vast forest. I ean see the colours of autumn. Nightly frost that made flowers withered is silent messenger of whole life's doom.
