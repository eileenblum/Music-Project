Torments raging trough my veins while shinig I decaiv. You will die by my teeth, for I am your reaper, in eternal night, in eternal winter

Suffer and die, I'm the return of your death. You thought you could escape Eternal winter freezes your breath'

Demons...calling your name, they want to lear your soul away. Into your eyes I stab a splinter. See the eternal night, the eternal winter

Suffer and die, I'm the return of your death. You thought you could escape Eternal winter freezes your breath'

In Siberia I live on my own, in a hut which is built of your bones. In search of my wife, where can I find her, in eternal night, in eternal winter

You wear guilt of her death, I couldn't save her. Jesus Christ that's one reason why I hate you' Fall from grace, my son will kill your father, in eternal night, in eternal winter.

Suffer and die, I'm the return of your death. You thought you could escape Eternal winter freezes your breath'
