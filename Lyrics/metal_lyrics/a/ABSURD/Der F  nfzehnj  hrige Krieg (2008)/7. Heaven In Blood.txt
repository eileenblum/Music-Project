White are the Wings of the Angels, white their heaven, white are their clouds. Bright the golden sun shines down, sparkling the words out of God's mouth. Too long God's reign has been lasting. Time to end it, Hells rise Up'. Wrought a bloodbath in Paradise, brave Satan's legions can't be stopped.

Trashing and Burning and Hacking and Slaying blood pours from Heaven, like rain from the Sky'. Trashing and Burning and Hacking and Slaying blood pours from Heaven, like rain from the Sky'. Heaven in Blood! Heaven in Blood! Heaven in Blood! Heaven in Blood!

Read are the broken wings of dead Angels, red is their heaven, red are their clouds. Silver the freezing moon shines down, Blazing the words out of Satan's mouth'. Deep within the lake of fire the lamb of god - my scorn! The final battle against heavens army, by the Antichrist has been won'.

Trashing and Burning and Hacking and Slaying blood pours from Heaven, like rain from the Sky'. Trashing and Burning and Hacking and Slaying blood pours from Heaven, like rain from the Sky'. Heaven in Blood! Heaven in Blood! Heaven in Blood! Heaven in Blood!
