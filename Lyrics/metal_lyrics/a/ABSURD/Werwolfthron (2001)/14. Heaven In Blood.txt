White are the Wings of the Angels,
white is their heaven, white are their clouds.
Bright the golden sun shines down,
sparkling the words out of GodÂ´s mouth.
Too long GodÂ´s reign has been lasting -
Time to end it, Hell rise Up!
Wrought a bloodbath in Paradise,
brave Satanâs legions canât be stopped!!!

Thrashing and Burning and Hacking and Slaying -
blood pours from Heaven, like rain from the Sky!


Heaven in Blood!
Heaven in Blood!
Heaven in Blood!
Heaven in Blood!

Red are the broken wings of dead Angels,
red is their heaven, red are their clouds.
Silver the freezing moon shines down,
Blazing the words out of Satanâs mouth!
Deep within the lake of fire -
the lamb of god- my scorn!
The final battle against heavens army,
by the Antichrist has been won!

Heaven in Blood!
Heaven in Blood!
Heaven in Blood!
Heaven in Blood!
