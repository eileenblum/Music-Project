Thuringian plain, deep dark forest
Evil dwells on there in the woods
Snowcovered hills, cold winds blowing
Romantic place, is it understood?

[Kehrreim:]
Evil in the forest in Germany's Green Heart!

Hateful savages, strong black minds
Out of the forest, kill the human kind
Burn the settlements and grow the woods
Until this romantic place is understood!

Animals, beasts, horrend landscape
Cause there are no signs of human living
When you look around no human living
Now this romantic place is understood!
