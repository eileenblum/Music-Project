You
Always get exactly what you want
You 
This is only my life that you taunt
Always giving me enough to keep me quiet
Only giving me enough to keep me at bay

Why don't you leave me alone

I don't need you

This
Is the very thing that I disgust
Promise me again
And I hope your jaw fucking rusts
I did what you wanted didn't I?

Why don't you leave me alone
Always on the verge of something
Almost about to leave it all
I don't need you

Open your blessed wings
And wrap them around all your things
Keep yourself in the company of kings
Cause it's there hands' that bleed from the strings

No more
