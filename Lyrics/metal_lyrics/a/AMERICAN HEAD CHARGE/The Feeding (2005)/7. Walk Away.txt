Money is hate
So love me now
While I'm still unimportant enough to be
I will prove myself
And absence a shadow
I will never be what you don't deserve

Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better

Follow me and you'll find
Your reflection is not even close to your's anymore
Images patterned on dreams on your secrets
Poisoning connections as you slide away from gone

Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away

From you

We're dirty and hungry and bitter and tired and broke and bruised and battered so happy

I've been here way too long

Money is hate
So love me now
While I'm still unimportant enough to be
I will prove myself
And absence a shadow
I will never be what you don't deserve

Cause it's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better to walk away
It's better
