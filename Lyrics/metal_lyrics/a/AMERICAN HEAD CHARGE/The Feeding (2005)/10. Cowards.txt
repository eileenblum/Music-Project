This is the way to find my harlequin's face
To my junkie dead body
Still covered in lace
The flesh still warm where skin had once been
My smile just scattered fragments lining the ditch
You like to watch when I bleed

(like a coward)
I've got some right here for you
I push you down on your knees
(such a good whore)
I make your dreams come true

At 60 miles an hour on course and pace
in hybrid mental states
So my pathetic limp kiss has never caught this way
No catalyst begins across the face of those
who end
Leaving it's scar too deep for all of your
attempts to mend

Come on cowards
Come on you whores

I've got no choice but this if
I can't get rid of it
You'll never be any match 
For what I can do to myself

I'm still stuck here breaking it backwards apart
Watching all the raindrops cover up before
we can start

(like a coward)
Without a doubt that all will be washed away
There's still no proof to see if I will someday

You like to watch when I bleed

(like a coward)
I've got some right here for you
I push you down on your knees
(such a good whore)
I make your dreams come true

I've got no choice but this if
I can't get rid of it
You'll never be any match 
For what I can do to myself
