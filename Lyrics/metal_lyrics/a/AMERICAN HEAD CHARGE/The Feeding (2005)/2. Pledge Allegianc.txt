We're just the braces amidst
These selfish trials and fits
Not so safe or scared or dumb is the rest
Our unraveling has just
Enough of it here to be
Down propped up and watching
You stare at us pull you down
You read the news
You take the vows
You blame the costs
We play the chords
Now the only course
That traces an end
To the violence
Has left us without any
Chance to stand our ground

...Stand up and...

March
Get back in line and
Fight
The time to start is
Now
Don't let yourself play the
Fool
There's no way out

Placatingly wound we search
Without purpose the game ends
Promise me today 
So tomorrow's a new surprise
All these sores lingering
Shutdown and loving it
The greedy hands will lie
But we stand ready to strike
Yours' is the blood
Theirs' the thirst
The speed the greed
The machines and the paper dolls
We didn't want this
We didn't need this
We couldn't see it coming
But we're to blame for it

...Stand up and...

March
Get back in line and
Fight
The time to start is
Now
