It's just a reason to deny
All the limits that border
On the thinnest frailties
That makes a sudden change
I'll play my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that i keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all

Where is your loyalty now?
When all the cards have been left one the table

All of them
Bleed at the nerves That take so long to wear down
I'll play my soul into sleep
I'll make up words that i keep
Letting nothing go to anyone at all

Where is your loyalty now?
When all the cards have been left one the table

This time I have made enough mistakes
For you to bear against me
Endure and break
Our original ideals
That let us down
And betray our trust
Like all your promises

I've seen the piece of shit alive in you
Cause I'm there enough to be here too
