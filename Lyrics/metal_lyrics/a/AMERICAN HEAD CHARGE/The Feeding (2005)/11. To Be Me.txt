Have you any idea
What it's like to be me
Watching you succeed and move forward
All my wasted time tensing in anticipation
My thought process
Full grown and worthless

Safe when nobody is in your heart now
Take everything you can get your hands on
Save me save me from this yearning yet again

I have become what I always knew
I have become what I always knew
Every salvageable breath choked off in fear
I am the last thing I'll ever expect form me

Safe when nobody is in your heart now
Take everything you can get your hands on
Save me save me from this yearning yet again

Have you any idea
What it's like to be me
