Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs

So, you think you got it
You think you know
You wanna bring me down
I am in my finest hour
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're watching me dying
How am I looking?
Why don't you take a picture
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs

My fear, traps me waiting for it
My past if glowing red and yellow, again

Run, back where you came form
Not that i matters
I'll never see you again
My fists strain to sift mercy
Ridicule my own
So precious alone
These faces of everyone
Remind me of home
You're plotting riddled sin
All my needs giving in
Blow me a kiss
And leave me to the dogs

My fear, traps me waiting for it
My past is glowing red and yellow, again
My fate will show me where to follow
