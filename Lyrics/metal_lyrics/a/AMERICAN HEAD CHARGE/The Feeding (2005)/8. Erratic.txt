Stalking the currency shifts
As cause becomes
Embedded codes digital mistakes
So all the rest can
Choke for need and strain to bleed
The hunger I fix a taste for the feeding
This panic perpetuating poison upon us
As it plagues me into

Running the gamut again
Surprise you're wrong
I'm not the defects for ones
You left out
Erratic an addict
Is leading my fall
Back to the faces
My weaknesses live

Shots down and riding the bomb

Routine submissive disease
Just let me rot
Done with all these innocence thieves
While all us weak ones
Choke for need and strain to bleed
The hunger I fix a taste for the feeding
This panic perpetuating poison upon us
As it plagues me into

Running the gamut again
Surprise you're wrong
I'm not the defects for ones
You left out
Erratic an addict
Is leading my fall
Back to the faces
My weaknesses live

Shots down and riding the bomb
