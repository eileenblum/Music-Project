This most unwitting occurrence
Is indeed about you
So take it
Or chalk it up
All these others before me
Can't give what I doubt

Take what I've taken

The three of threes
Professes you to me
Challenging and the favor will be
Paid in full
Pounds of flesh
In perfect dress

Take what I've taken

This most unwitting occurrence
This most unwitting occurrence
Is indeed about you
So take it
Or chalk it up
All these others before me
Can't doubt
What's killing you
Wells from inside
Atonement for the waste
Pleasure in one more accolade
Prehensive doubt prehensive...

One day, I know when I see you
Far from these days that beat us
Far from my habits perfect prison
