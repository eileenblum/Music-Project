It's been after me
In this place
A present threat perfect void
Stuck in modality
With all this damage beyond repair

When all our time fades away
Just like everything else
That proves that we are

Dirt 

Stay now just in case
Selfish trials
Keep stopping to
Drag me down
And losing bliss
As if all your hands
Could keep me clean

When all our time fades away
Just like everything else
That proves that we are

Dirt

I can't see where I've gone wrong
All our time fades away
And proves that we are

Dirt
If all our time fades away
It's proof we're dirt
