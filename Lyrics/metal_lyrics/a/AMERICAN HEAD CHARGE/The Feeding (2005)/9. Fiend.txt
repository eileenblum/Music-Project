I want to be
Somewhere far from here
I'm watching you
As you wave goodbye
I won't take
I won't weigh you down
Following suit
So just count me out

I can't get it out
Can't put it together
I should've known better
Than to turn into this

Fiend

I can't believe
I've become removed
Tighten the line
And pull up hello
I will change
I won't weigh me down
Carving this space
Never count me out

I can't get it out
Can't put it together
I should've known better
Than to turn into this

Fiend

I say
Everything's how it ought to be
I say
Nothing should ever change
I say
I only know how it used to be
I say
I don't want a fucking thing to do with it
