I know too much and Iâve had enough
So I left it all and I call your bluff
Well such surprise with all my might
I struggle fast beneath your fight
Such subtle moves your grand design
A sentiment your fault in kind

We sleep for now
And wait for better times
Just let this all play out
I will have my day

All of your virtues
But you refuse to see me
I cleared my life for you
So you just let me go without
You canât justify it all
Not so sorry now
I bear this life
While you just shoved us all away

We sleep for now
And wait for better times
Just let this all play out
I will have my day

I want myself and hate to die
I find myself and hate to want
I hate myself and want to die
I know Iâm nothing but the purest motherfucking sunshine

We sleep for now
And wait for better times
Just let this all play out
I will have my day
