Wonât you be my skin and bones
Now that everything has soured
And obscured down underneath
Everyone deserves the spoils
But youâve waited way too long
Now there's no apologies

A plasticized store bought antiquated whore
Thirteen feet buried under the box you left me in
Iâve taken you for sport a deafening report
The flowers are all dead but I continue to win

I donât wanna be you
Youâve always sucked for free
I donât wanna see you
Prolific catastrophe
[x2]

With baited breath on pins and needles
The mountain starts to move
To cut the ocean right in half
Weâre tightening the screws

A plasticized store bought antiquated whore
Thirteen feet buried under the box you left me in
Iâve taken you for sport a deafening report
The flowers are all dead but I continue to win

I donât wanna be you
Youâve always sucked for free
I donât wanna see you
Prolific catastrophe
[x2]

Youâre a damaged ingrate much like the rest of us
Thereâs no coincidence itâs exactly what you thought it was
I'm accepting thank yous for the offering of you
It worked out well
Just exactly what you thought it was

I donât wanna be you
Youâve always sucked for free
I donât wanna see you
Prolific catastrophe
[x2]
