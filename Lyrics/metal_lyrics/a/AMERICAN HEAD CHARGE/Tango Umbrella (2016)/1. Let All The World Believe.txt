All these rationalities keep turning.
SNAKING THEIR WAY TOWARD AN EXIT INSIDE OF ME!
Another line another lie more delusion.
EXCUSE ME WHILE I FORCE-FEED MYSELF!
Cause what brings me to this is never my own FAULT!
I'M ALWAYS FURTHER AWAY!
Each and every time I stray it's POISON!
IN THE AIR I BREATHE, SO!

Let all the world believe!
That it's their god whose listening!
Another productive sin!
The distance between is sickening!

You're PATHETIC!
All this misery, tell me, what has it brought to you in your life?
YOU'RE NOTHING!
Fall asleep at the start so you can't finish.
Your achieving a perfectly sordid REPUTATION!
It's everything that's wrong with this world that stirs MY HUNGER FOR REVENGE!
Such warm kind-hearted threats.
YOU'RE REACHING AND HOPING BUT SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF..

Let all the world believe!
That it's their god whose listening!
Another productive sin!
The distance between is sickening!

YOUR CAUSE DIES ALONE!
A PATHETIC SHOW!
YOUR CAUSE DIES ALONE!

There's nothing to hold onto now.
There's nothing to hope for.
There's nothing to hold onto now.
NOTHING CAN HELP ME NOW!
NOTHING CAN HURT ME ANYMORE!

Let all the world believe!
That it's their god whose listening!
Another productive sin!
The distance between is sickening!

Let all the world believe (believe!)!
That it's their god whose listening (listening!)!
Another productive sin (productive sin!)!
The distance between is sickening (sickening!)!

Shut up!
Don't need it!
Just let it go!

Shut up!
Don't need it!
Just let it go!

Shut up!
Don't need it!
Just let it go!

Shut up!
Don't need it!
Just let it go!
