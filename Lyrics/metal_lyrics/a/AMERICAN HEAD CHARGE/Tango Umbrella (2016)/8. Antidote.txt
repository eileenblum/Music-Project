Look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Is it someone who might be someone
Maybe just might get to be
Now all your mistakes have been laid out
A glimpse before your eyes of me now

Itâs such a thin, thin line in between all of it
Itâs holding me beneath keeping me at bay so I can
Sculpt my dreams in black and white
Youâre my little play thing
Who always makes sure I sleep tight
Kids come get your medicine itâs the antidote that keeps you well and quiet

This sickness robs me of a life lost in perception
Held in the shadows kept in the habit because
Each one repairs the next in perfect succession
Each one repairs the next with perfect success

Itâs such a thin, thin line in between all of it
Itâs holding me beneath keeping me at bay so I can
Sculpt my dreams in black and white
Youâre my little play thing
Who always makes sure I sleep tight
Kids come get your medicine itâs the antidote that keeps you well and quiet
Kids come get your medicine itâs the antidote that keeps you well and quiet

Come get your medicine [x8]
Come get your...
