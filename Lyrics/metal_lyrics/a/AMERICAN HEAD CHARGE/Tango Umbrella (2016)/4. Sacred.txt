Selling my soul
Every day for a taste
Fixing all my feelings
With a spoon full of black
Is there nothing sacred anymore
Sacred
Complete the purchase
Protect the product
Pursuit of pleasure
A pinpoint puncture
The decisions easy
In spite of the toll
When youâre the one whoâs beneath
The one without a soul
Dream us away
Dream us away
Is there nothing sacred anymore
Is there nothing sacred anymore
Nothing sacred
Sacred
