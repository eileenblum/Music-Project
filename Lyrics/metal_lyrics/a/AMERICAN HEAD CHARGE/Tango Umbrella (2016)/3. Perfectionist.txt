Misled by the minutes.
Left lacking in every tone.
A distraction from truth.
Hanging above your head.

Misleading every minute.
Distractions from truth.
Stripped off of all the panic.
Leaves me brightly blinded.

I can't!
Resist!
Throwing it all away!

No chains can change his words.
His good side is flesh.
No masks to protect faces.
So, what's your motivation?

I can't!
Resist!
Throwing it all away!

It doesn't matter anyway.
These words have fallen on deaf ears.
I don't do it for approval.
I do it so I can stand me.

Outlast the opposition.
Your grand prize is 'silence'.

I can't!
Resist!
Throwing it all away!

It doesn't matter anyway.
These words have fallen on deaf ears.
I don't do it for approval.
I do it so I can stand me.

It doesn't matter anyway (it doesn't matter).
These words have fallen on deaf ears (fallen away).
I don't do it for approval (you don't like me).
I do it so I can stand me.
