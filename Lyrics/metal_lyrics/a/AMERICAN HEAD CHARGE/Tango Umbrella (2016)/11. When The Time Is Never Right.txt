I donât expect you to ever understand
What it is that moves inside of me
Always expected to bear the worst of it
Expectations to be first

It is just something to shake your fragile little tree
I'm ripping all your fruit away
That you grip so tightly
So no one can taste it
Because I know you hate it
When the time is never right

I'm luring in the guilt
Perfection torments me
To see them all through your eyes from above
Soaked in all the sweat and all the blood
Doomed within without
Soaked in the sweat and all the blood
Doomed within

It is just something to shake your fragile little tree
I'm ripping all your fruit away
That you grip so tightly
So no one can taste it
Because I know you hate it
When the time is never right

This lasting impression when I close my eyes
Is haunting me and wishing me well
This lasting impression when I close my eyes
Is haunting me and wishing me well
Itâs haunting me

It is just something to shake your fragile little tree
Iâm ripping all your fruit away
That you grip so tightly
So no one can taste it
Because I know you hate it
When the time is never right
When the time is never
When the time is never right
