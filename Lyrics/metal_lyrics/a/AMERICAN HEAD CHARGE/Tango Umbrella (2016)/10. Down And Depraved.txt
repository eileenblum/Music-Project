Last chance coming up with another sorry excuse
I'm so tired of your never ending pity party
I'm not gonna let you hold me down anymore
I'm not gonna eat your scraps up off the dirty floor
This predictable storyline with you at the center
You keep reminding me but I just forget it

You're so right
Cause I'm so wrong
How can you really be so naive
Tight to the vest or face up down the sleeve
How can you really be so naive
Tight to the vest or face up down the sleeve
The nothing destroys
The something enjoys

I can't stand that submissiveness bullshit on your face
It's gone on way too long you're far too sick to be this strong
I can't wait to drop you like the habit and quickly replace

You're so right
Cause I'm so wrong
How can you really be so naive
Tight to the vest or face up down the sleeve
How can you really be so naive
Tight to the vest or face up down the sleeve
The nothing destroys
The something enjoys
The bitter aftertaste
My beautiful noise

This is what getting
It's all you're getting
This is what getting
It's all you're getting from me

[4x]
This is what getting
It's all you're getting from me

This is what getting
It's all you're getting
This is what getting
It's all you're getting from me

[2x]
I'm so sorry I'm not who you are or who you'd have me be
I'm so sorry
Well, I'm not sorry for all the love you save me or who you're lying next to

You should've kept me in the cage I came in
Or I might rattle it to the ground
You got no idea what you're up against
I'm licking my lips at the thought of it
Your little center's just so itty-bitty
I don't want to break you in half
I'm gonna take my time working you over
I insist upon your discipline
And maybe get a little rough
And maybe just a little more
But I guarantee you will fuckin' love it
You keep on crying and crying it out
So when you're done I might just take you with me
Kept in my pocket like a little slave
You're at the ready when I gotta have it
Someone to get down and depraved
Give it to me
