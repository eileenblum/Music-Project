How can I express with meaning...
How I feel?
Any attempt will just fall short...
In vain.
There's only one way I can think of that makes any sense..

You are a... king among men.
You are a... king among men.

I...
Met you...
I...
Met you...

Now everyday is different. But, the same.
We try to put this behind us.
But, your memory remains.

You never quite knew just what you meant to me.

You are a... king among men
You are a... king among men

I...
Met you...
I...
Met you...

I just wish that you were there beside us.
I just wish that you were here...
