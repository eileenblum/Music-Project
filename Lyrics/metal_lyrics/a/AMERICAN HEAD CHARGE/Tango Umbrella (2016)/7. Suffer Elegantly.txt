You criticize my descent and analyze my intent
Your vantage point shows all the angles as obvious
You might as well take your shot whether I like it or not
You have the answers without hearing the questions
You think youâre winning but youâre killing yourself
Youâre just beginning but youâre running through hell
The frictions dragging but you refuse to help
The waterâs rising and itâs filling the well

This is our great divide
Our only time to shine
Armed to the fucking teeth
With nothing else but time

I just keep watching how they all cower
Not like the itch that comes from having to know
I just keep thinking the nonsense sold for it
The all too willing voice so ready to yield
You think youâre winning but youâre killing yourself
Youâre just beginning but youâre running through hell
The frictions dragging but you refuse to help
The waterâs rising and itâs filling the well

This is our great divide
Our only time to shine
Armed to the fucking teeth
With nothing else but time

Thereâs so much more to this because there has to be
I canât just continue to let this all go
So keep on pressing down and keep on testing me
To see at what point I will give up and fail
You suffer so elegantly
You suffer so elegantly
Itâs all going down
Just jump in and drown
Without regret without a sound
You think youâre winning but youâre killing yourself
Youâre just beginning but youâre running through hell
The frictions dragging but you refuse to help
The waterâs rising and itâs filling the well

This is our great divide
Our only time to shine
Armed to the fucking teeth
With nothing else but time
