I see your mask
It makes me start to believe
Why do you ask
Because you're prone to deceive

I see your mask
It makes me start to believe
Why do you ask
Because you're prone to deceive

Once I start I won't stop

I want you to really need it so bad
I want you to really need it so bad
I want you to really need it so bad
I want you to really need it so bad
So bad
So bad
So bad

It's just a taste
Spread right across both your lips
It's just a waste
Because your grip always slips

It's just a taste
Spread right across both your lips
It's just a waste
Because your grip always slips

Once I start I won't stop

I want you to really need it so bad
I want you to really need it so bad
I want you to really need it so bad
I want you to really need it so bad

Swimming in desperation
Drowning under everything
Ignore the expectation

I want you to really need it so bad (Ignore the expectation)
I want you to really need it so bad (Ignore the expectation)
I want you to really need it so bad (Ignore the expectation)
I want you to really need it so bad (Ignore the expectation)

Everything (so bad)
Everything (so bad)
Everything (so bad)
Everything (so bad)
Everything (so bad)
Everything (so bad)
Everything (so bad)
Everything (so bad)
