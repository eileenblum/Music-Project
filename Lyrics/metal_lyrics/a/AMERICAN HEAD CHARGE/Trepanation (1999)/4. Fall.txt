Pathetic sympathies
left for the bleeding at heart 
everything fades to shit 
everything tears me apart 
caustic insecurities 
surface above the withheld 
everytime I need 
everything I want 
aesthetic disguises 
confuse easier tasks 
underlying doubts unfold 
and my direction dies 
everything's right up in your face 
everyone's right up in front 
push me against the wall 
but still you can't make me 
FALL 
Prosthetic misery 
idiosyncratic 
pushing me to never 
hold my breath 
synthetic misuses 
dragging me higher still 
you never brought me to 
and still you push me back 
anemic discipline 
produces bad thoughts 
everybody's wrong 
everybody's too strong 
everything's right up in your face 
everyone's right up in front 
push me against the wall 
but still you can't make me 
FALL 
Separate your mouth 
Scrape away your skin 
I DON'T LIKE YOU AT ALL
