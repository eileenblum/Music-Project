Play your games with my limp joints
idolize it's wet paper skin 
listen to the cast preach your life 
and infest you with disease 
dress me up with a three piece tourniquet 
fuck and get under the scabs 
never trust what you cannot kill 
and pretend that she respects you 
pursuit of liberty 
drags you all across this country 
this cunt bleeding 
delivered me 
the cord it stretches 
taught and only so far 
before it snaps back 
giving us relief 
it's just a matter of time 
it's just a matter of time 
before you fall down 
and hurt yourself 
far from home 
with no one's help 
we will be waiting 
but his eyes can't see the madness 
so she can keep the rule 
formulate what will be that thing that makes me laugh 
your next manipulation 
of the all too friendless 
always seen and never noticed 
dipping my feet in pools of you 
FUCK YOU 
make my face only how you like it 
why can't you smell it hide 
wreck her pussy with your fist 
she'll be your minister 
violate my stiff limp body 
only to taste my glass bloodline 
shove it all behind my back 
cauterize my open wound 
I never needed to leave 
to find out what makes me tick 
I arrived by default 
my arms three grand long 
but not elastic enough 
to care for insects 
just beyond my reach 
it's just a matter of time 
it's just a matter of time 
before I pick you up 
and dust you off 
kiss the eyes 
that make me rough 
I will be waiting 
I walked beside myself 
but nothing ever changed 
and now I walk away 
so you can take the blame 
clinical distortion 
affects the bachelor 
I still can't find
