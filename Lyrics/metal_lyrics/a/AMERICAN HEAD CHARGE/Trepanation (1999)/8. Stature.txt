Beautiful disease
trying to stop those fleas 
resist complacences 
for what you seize 
sinister laughing in back corners of my mind 
provides my sustinence 
a no handed attempt 
a rude man at the front 
the right bowed to but dead 
accomplished undertone 
shoveling to the def 
out of your other lips 
but making me happy 
three in the front room 
are fucking on top of my bed 
uplifting opening 
old scars thought of as healed 
say your prayers for your hate 
a nympho to yourself 
and now my face it breathes my lies 
and my lies, they make me drown
