An overwhelming understanding
of chaos brings you to your knees 
impurities make me the way that I am 
the dirt in my veins 
the games on my thoughts 
the stains on your face 
they break it apart 
Pushing the envelope 
Life sets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
Hate gets me off 
Motherfucking 
Pushing the envelope 
gets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
your face it sets me off 
I'm curled up inside myself so I won't imagine the pictures 
If I had prosthetic eyes I still think I'd see the same 
satisfy retribution in lies 
to resemble innocence in lies 
subsequent afternoon's turning scared 
bothered by fallacies everyone's scared 
Pushing the envelope 
Life sets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
Hate gets me off 
Motherfucking 
Pushing the envelope 
gets me off 
Pushing the envelope 
your face it sets me off 
Killing myself like a tool in wrong 
Disquieting changes in direction
