The crowd did move
was it live 
the course it took 
was it right 
the crown I wore 
was it mine 
the lips that lie 
is it true 
the lace that tears 
is it skin 
the line that binds 
is it real 
the face that smiles 
is it yours 
the fall that kills 
is it dead 
to control the mannequin 
your wrists will shake 
without circulation 
your face will twitch 
do you feel 
better than me 
do you taste 
better than me 
the prey that hunts 
was it found 
the people die 
is it right 
the place is lost 
will it turn 
the guilt that hurts 
will it change 
the guess that shames 
will it smile 
the game that plays 
does it hurt 
the fail that's right 
does it taste 
the fuck that hates 
do you care 
did you get 
what you wanted 
to taste acid 
to taste guilt 
to taste shame 
to taste hate 
to taste death 
to taste black 
to taste acid 
to taste red 
to taste hell 
to taste me 
for you to swell 
to taste god 
to taste acid
