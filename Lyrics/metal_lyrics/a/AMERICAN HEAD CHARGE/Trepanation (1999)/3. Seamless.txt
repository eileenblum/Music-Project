Shit filled spasms
deep in the colostomy bag 
I like being trapped inside 
the plastics wearing out 
red and perfect 
her legs spread out in front of me 
they're so open they make me sweat 
it's my lubrication 
recent findings 
say circumcise the abstinent 
and make it hard for them to breathe 
I like to make you lie 
dropped and so ill 
steeped in my misogyny 
my shaking hands are in the skin 
I've gone to far too soon 
you look so seamless now 
she stared at me 
thinking I was sweet to it 
her legs tied up 
apart for me 
it feels so good inside 
now I'm thinking 
who's this that lies under me 
and needs a piece of my respect 
you make me so sick, I'm 
crawling, broken 
my face is cringing to see 
figures drawn inside of you 
succumb succumb succumb 
sickness fittings 
procured this fascist medium 
but now I'm laughing in your face 
you lie you lie you lie 
you look so seamless now 
take me 
take my life
