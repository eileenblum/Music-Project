I step with two hands open
and kick the man in front of me 
reminded of my father 
when will you ever learn 
I found you urinating 
you found me interesting 
torn raw and feeling sickness 
permit my hypocrisy 
feel the thick curtain 
while she sleeps 
the stench of my breath pains you 
but your just smelling yourself 
my plate shows something rotten 
I feel so right at home 
dress me in mothers clothing 
to teach me how to fuck myself 
fracture my arm like you know 
the abuse makes it feel right 
feel the thick curtain 
while she sleeps
