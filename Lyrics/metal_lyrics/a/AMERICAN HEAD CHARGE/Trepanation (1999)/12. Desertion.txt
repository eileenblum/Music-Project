Hey I want your skin to get me off
you make it sound so fucking pure 
I'll bring you down and make you scream 
take in what you once thought was hate 
and now I want to make it right 
and you can't take that away from me 
strive to make you cower like a pig 
sit and squirm in your own stink 
you have been the sickest of them all 
gone back to the way it never worked 
did you want me to mistreat you 
did you want me to pretend
