I'm chewing my tongue
it makes it so numb 
my lower coverings 
house many children 
so many piercings 
I can't stop bleeding 
trails are all I see 
can't help being me 
I am so cool 
so fucking different 
I am so cool 
so fucking different 
we're all the same 
so very different 
so fucked up we drool 
it's all the same 
so many tweakings 
I can't stop peaking 
my fucking parents 
after school meetings 
I've got not future 
won't even try 
I'm failing at life 
get high and then I die
