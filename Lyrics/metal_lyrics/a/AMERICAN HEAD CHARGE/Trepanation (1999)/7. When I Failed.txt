Decide everything for me
subject yourself to it 
make believe it's only your fault 
stifle my own 
ambition 
It's been so long since I failed 
nothing alienates this 
anything reminds me 
relieving it only helps 
suffer to make your own gains 
It's been so long since I failed 
and now my senses fail me 
and still my training fails me 
and now everything fails me 
and still everyone fails me 
and still the only thing I have fails me
