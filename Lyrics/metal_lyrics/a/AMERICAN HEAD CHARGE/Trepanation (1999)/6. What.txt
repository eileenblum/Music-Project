Your mom didn't tell you
you'd have nothing to say 
shut the fuck up bitch 
in a poisoned state 
while the rapist behind you 
is whispering your name 
my lies foreshadow me 
they make a scab of me 
I can't crawl through this 
you can't shut me up 
you can't shut me up 
make it rough 
what 
difficulty breathing makes you drip 
swallowing on first dates entertains 
I scream mistakenly 
I'm trying to make you see 
what makes him resent you 
that's right I lie 
solid filth til I die 
but it makes me smile 
lord of the elite 
is prince of the cowards 
try not to choke on it 
you can't shut me up 
you can't shut me up 
make it rough 
what 
difficulty breathing makes you drip 
swallowing on first dates entertains 
misogynist attracted to you 
wallowing in pity's comfortable 
what 
get up
