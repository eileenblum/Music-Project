I know this much
I can't stand me 
when I become him 
I know this much 
I don't feel free 
when I'm repentant 
tell him this much 
you don't want him 
due to extra skin 
tell him this much 
you forsake him 
due to pretension 
and now we have 
everything we need 
to come up to 
where you're pristine 
we believe 
tell him this much 
you can't withstand 
taking it upright 
tell him this much 
you felt dirty 
because it was tight 
I know this much 
that old feeling 
I'm done hanging on 
I know this much 
enough pretending 
what was had is gone 
and now we have 
everything we need 
to come to where 
up you are clean 
we believe
