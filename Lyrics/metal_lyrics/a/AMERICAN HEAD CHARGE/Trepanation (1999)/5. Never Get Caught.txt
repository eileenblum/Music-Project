Follow me now and I will drown you
fill you full of reason 
no windows | I'll take you 
to the dirty place that I love 
slipping on messes you made when I hit you 
makes me more excitable 
I'll never get caught 
I'll never get caught 
pull it tight I'll see right through it 
I'll Never Get Caught 
Cradle the difference in front of your fist 
force it down to bring it back up and make them 
listen one more time 
Wrapping you up in an American flag 
I fuck you for the glory 
no complaints 
from my friends 
they keep their fucking mouths shut 
I couldn't care less about the way that you see me 
soothing I will never be 
I'll always get shit 
I'll always get shit 
for acknowledging perversity
