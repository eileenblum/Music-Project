[2007 "Can't Stop The Machine" compilation track]The pulse in the bass drum lulls you close enough for a peek of what is to come
Of this forming into around and right over a sound that has had you locked
Ever since it began and for feeling your trap never know where you are at
It is just the only thing that ever keeps me ready for it
It is like I am marching from downstream but I will never come up

Let them tick their mark in my eyes wearing your crown on the dress
You do not know what you have done it is in my ruin for life
The sun keeps staring me down every reflection it finds lamenting on my skin
Within the scent of the night right there where people fail to excel I leave my kiss on the table
It is like I am marching from downstream but I will never come up

Please say you are what you offer do not say I am alone
Please say you are what you offer do not say you
You are getting the best of me just what you deserve
You are getting the best of me just what you deserve
I am getting the best of you just what I deserve
I am getting the best of you just what I deserve
Please say you are what you offer do not say I am alone
Please say you are what you offer do not say you
It is like I am marching from downstream but I will never come up
