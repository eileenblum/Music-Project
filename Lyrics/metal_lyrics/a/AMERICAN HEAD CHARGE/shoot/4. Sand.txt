In the waters
Of your own making
Building waves of apathy
Cause I still dream of it
Back in my hands
Just look at you all
So ripe and at your best
(i want it)
How can you breathe with a mouth full of sand
And how will you live up to all they demand
I can see the panic in your eyes
The manifested fear in every form
So grit your teeth
And await the coming storm
Wave goodbye to reason
Let silence speak for itself
(Shut the fuck up)
How can you breathe with a mouth full of sand
And how will you live up to all they demand
Theyâre coming for us, theyâre everywhere, weâre all surrounded, the end is near
Thereâs no escaping, they smell the fear, our fates been written, the end is here
You suffocate me like I was never there, I got lost again, in the hunt far from here
Cause I got these dreams that parade, in my head nothings right, so you can run
And fucking hide, from it all, cause their blood kept pouring for no life til their own broke down
How can you breathe with a mouth full of sand
How will you live up to all they demand
