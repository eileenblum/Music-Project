[originally by Patti Smith]Baby was a black sheep baby was a whore.
Baby got big and baby get bigger.
Baby get something baby get more.
Baby was a rock-and-roll nigger.
Look around you, all around you riding on a copper wave.
Do you like the world around you are you ready to behave?
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
Outside of society, that's where I want to be.

Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore.
You know she got big. Well, she's gonna get bigger.
Baby got a hand; got a finger on the trigger.
Baby, baby, baby is a rock-and-roll nigger.
Outside of society, that's where I want to be.
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.

Those who have suffered, understand suffering and thereby extend their hand the storm that brings harm also makes fertile
Blessed is the grass and herb and the true thorn and light

I was lost in a valley of pleasure I was lost in the infinite sea.
I was lost, and measure for measure love spewed from the heart of me.
I was lost, and the cost and the cost didn't matter to me.
I was lost, and the cost was to be outside society.
Jimi Hendrix was a nigger. Jesus Christ and Grandma, too.
Jackson Pollock was a nigger.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger nigger, nigger, nigger.
Outside of society, they're waiting for me.
Outside of society, if you're looking that's where you'll find me.
Outside of society, they're waiting for me outside of society
