You're a parasitic thief
A demon's diamond facet
I'm driven straight into the reef
Your malevolence in passing

Must I dance to the price on my head
As you seek out to prey on the weak

They all know
They all know
They all know

Sleep tight now
Knowing that your life has ended

Must I dance to the price on my head
As you seek out to prey on the weak

You're just another notch on the barrel of my gun I keep pointing at my head
Another writhe, that much closer to the me
You're just another notch on the barrel of my gun I keep pointing at my head
Another writhe, that much closer to the end

They go
They go

They all know
They all know

You're just another notch on the barrel of my gun I keep pointing at my head
Another writhe, that much closer to the me
You're just another fucking notch on the barrel of my gun I keep pointing at my head
Another writhe, that much closer to the end
