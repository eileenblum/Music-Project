My insanity is the very thing tempting you
Grown up without only to be kept inside
Almost and still never causing you trauma
Broken and sore from all the suckers you invite
Set yourself on fire again
Set yourself up for another disaster
No one gives a shit about you
They all wanna see you fail
Now your vanity is the very thing keeping you
Hating yourself only to be masked as pride
Always the thrill in the search for some drama
Callused and torn from all the violence you fight
Set yourself on fire again
Set yourself up for another disaster
No one gives a shit about you
They all wanna see you fail
La la la la la la la la
