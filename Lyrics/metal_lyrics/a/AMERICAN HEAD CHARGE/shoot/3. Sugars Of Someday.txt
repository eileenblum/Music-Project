I've lived with the pain I'm feeling
Sat out in the morning rain
Youâre betting the chase is ending
But thereâs something in the way

We all will swim forever
We all will swim forever

Swim in the sugars of someday maybe
Swim in the sugars of someday maybe

She keeps her dreams locked up tight
In a tiny matchbook house
Thereâs no way to mend it
So just let it go

We all will swim forever
We all will swim forever

Swim in the sugars of someday maybe
Swim in the sugars of someday maybe
In the sugars of someday

This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you
This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you
This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you
This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you
This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you
This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you
This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you
This is the way to survive all of the lies they tell you

Iâm gonna dance with the devil hand in hand,
Weâre gonna paint this whole motherfucker red
I got all the time in the world,
So letâs just dive right in and just

Swim in the sugars of someday maybe
Swim in the sugars of someday maybe
Swim in the sugars of someday
