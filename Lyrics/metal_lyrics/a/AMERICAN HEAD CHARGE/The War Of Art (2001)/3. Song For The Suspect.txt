I can still watch those eyes
crawling over her dress until
I could show you everything
but I dont have to hear the words
cause I already  feel your thoughts
so it comes as no surprise
that all the intent is real
all the suspects are right
if we stop
it all falls down
cover my eyes
obey my ignorance
to purify you
Ill only watch you rot
without malicious intent
your doubt resembles someone else
stick the needles in me
stick the needles in [3x]
if we watch
it all come down
breathe and let it go
dropped and winding
fuck your confession
fuck your confusion
dissolve my insides
make it hide
crawling on diginity
that which you do to me
hold on forever
the fair day we
weather
