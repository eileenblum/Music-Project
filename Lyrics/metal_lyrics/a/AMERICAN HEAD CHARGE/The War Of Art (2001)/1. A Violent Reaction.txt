lead me around
nurse my broken wing
with all the promises
you can never honor
I just dont care enough
to react to vain attempts
sent only to perpetuate
one's selfish little world
you wont see what ive become
youll wait and watch and still
youre only let down
a violent reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive
now here I stand
for nothing no one at all
I  lead you down
begging to touch you in the cold
you give me a reason
I will not be the one
through all the nonsense
there is a constant
you wont see what ive become
youll wait and watch and still
youre only let down
cause this feeling
has dawned the face of you
a violent reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive
you wont see what ive become
cause this feeling
has dawned the face of you
a violent reaction
struggling only to keep myself alive
