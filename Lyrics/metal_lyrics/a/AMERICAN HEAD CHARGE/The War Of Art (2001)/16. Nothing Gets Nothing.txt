freedom is everything
resolve impossible
you prayed for rain
ignoring the flood
you took me with you
to heaven
back again
bleed to remember
that everything ends
blind and looking forward
I can see the shapes
but cant make out the faces
still they come in close
excuse this ugly shell my
gaping holes drip pride
a systematic shutdown
of diminishing returns
NOTHING GETS EASIER GETS! [2X]
I held you down
on the day of the lord
31 marks like the day
I was born
I called you beautiful
before I knew you
watch me destroy it
set myself free
still so dead and frozen
we all survive it
restraints brought
back for color
the most insulting guilt
such sweet attractive layers
let me remove them all
NOTHING GETS EASIER GETS! [2X]
bring me home
let me down
send me back
collecting the phases
the less I give
its easier
the more we give
its nothing
NOTHING GETS NOTHING! [repeat]
