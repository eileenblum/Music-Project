an overwhelming understanding
of chaos brings you to your knees
impurities make me the way that I am
the dirt in my veins
the games on my thoughts
the stains on your face
they break it apart
motherfucking
pushing the envelope
life sets me off
pushing the envelope
hate gets me off
motherfucking
pushing the envelope
gets me off
pushing the envelope
your face it sets me off
Im curled up inside myself so
I wont imagine the pictures
If I had prosthetic eyes I still
think that Id see the same
satisfy retribution inside
to resemble innocence inside
subsequent afternoons turning  out seared
bothered by fallacies everyones scared

motherfucking
pushing the envelope
life sets me off
pushing the envelope
hate gets me off
motherfucking
pushing the envelope
gets me off
pushing the envelope
your face it sets me off [2x]

killing myself like a tool in wrong
disquieting changes in direction
just keep on pushing
motherfucker
