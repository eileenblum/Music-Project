Im above everything else
saved the ones that shouldnt be
hold on to them all so youll
find yourself away from me
our lost faith strung out on a line
my most empathetic dreams of you
the sorry excuses on which we dine
when all my fears tell me its true
borrowed dreams of some imagined future
all wrapped up inside this borrowed hope
dont manipulate the most
beautiful thing youll ever know
to the extent of saving your
ragged torn out sickly show
holding my head above the fold
cant decide which side I want
I buried everything so deep in the cold
now I stop inside of the lies I flaunt
borrowed dreams of some imagined future
all wrapped up inside this borrowed hope
pull it all away from me
show me all the things I can
never be allowed to see
its all so far away
if you must have faith in someone
trust that Ill push you away
if you must have faith in someone
trust that Ill push you away
what am I if
the flies all stick to me
what am I if
the maggots live in me
what am I if
Im closet to the stink
what am I if
youre all thats real to me
WHAT!AM!I!
teach me just show me
break everything flush it away
teach me just show me
the starts already over
break everything and
FLUSH IT AWAY!
