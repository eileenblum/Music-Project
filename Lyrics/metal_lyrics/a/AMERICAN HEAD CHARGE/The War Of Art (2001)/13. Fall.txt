pathetic sympathies
left for the bloody at heart
everything fades to shit
evertyhing tears me apart
caustic insecurities
surface above the witheld
every time I need
everything I want
aesthetic disguises
underlying doubts
my direction dies
everythings right up in your face
everythings right up in front
push me against the wall
but still you cant make me
fall
you cant make me
fall
seperate your mouth
scrape away
prosthetic misery
idiosyncratic
pushing me to never
hold my breath
everythings right up in your face
everythings right up in front
push me against the wall
but still you cant make me
fall
you cant make me
fall
seperate your mouth
scrape away
I dont like you at all!
