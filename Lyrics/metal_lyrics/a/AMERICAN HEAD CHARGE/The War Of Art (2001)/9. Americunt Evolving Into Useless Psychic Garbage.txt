walk with an impure mind
revelations unkind
abject dental of the flesh I feel
endure and make my mind
its never time to start
believing everything will all work out
bloody knuckles
empty cavity
swift disposal
empty cavity
weve blinded ourselves sick
to create room for it
never arriving when its  needed most
anticipation burns
unquenchable we learn
left holding nothing but the will to live
bloody knuckles
empty cavity
swift disposal
empty cavity
why? [4x]
negative takes its toll
constant release and hold
beware the trust that you
instill in me
beware the trust that you [2x]
beware the trust I instill in me
bloody knuckles
empty cavity
swift disposal
empty cavity
choke it up
choke it back
choke it down
choke it away
