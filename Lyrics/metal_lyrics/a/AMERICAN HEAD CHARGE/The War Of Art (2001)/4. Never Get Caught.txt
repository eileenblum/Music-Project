follow me now and I will drown you
fill you full of reason
no windows Ill take you
to the dirty place that I love
slipping on messes
you made when I hit you
makes me more exicitable
Ill never get caught [2x]
pull it tight Ill see right through it
Ill never get caught
cradle the difference in front of your fist
force it down to bring it back up
make them listen one more time
wrapping you up in an american flag
I fuck you for the glory
no complaints from my friends
they keep their fucking mouths shut
I couldnt care less
about the way  that you see me
soothing I will never be
Ill always get shit [2x]
for acknowledging pervisity
Ill never get caught
cradle the difference in front of your fist
force it down to bring it back up
make them listen one more time
never get caught
