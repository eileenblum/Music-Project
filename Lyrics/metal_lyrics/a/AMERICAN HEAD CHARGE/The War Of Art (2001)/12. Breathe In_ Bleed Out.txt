My throat is dry when I
(stain it)
keep the hate alive
(abuse it)
your lips are tight when I
(to keep it from)
cover them with mine
(running you)
this is a sickness
(need it)
you cannot conceive
(mistreat it)
it takes the quiet
(its all thats left)
to not exceed
(breathe in, bleed out)
where is your comfort now
its on the way out
where are your reasons now
theyre all worn out
My throat is tight when I
(pull it)
keep the hate alive
(push it)
your lips are dry when I
(tie it up in)
cover them with mine
(knots and)
Its an affliction
(lose it)
nothing comes to mind
(let go of it)
Its unstrategic
(all to keep it soft and cold)
nothing comes to mind
(breathe in,bleed out)
where is your comfort now
its on the way out
where are your reasons now
theyre all worn out
