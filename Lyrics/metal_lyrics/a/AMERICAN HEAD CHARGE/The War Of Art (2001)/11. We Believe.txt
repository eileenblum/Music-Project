I know this much
I cant stand me
when I become him
I know this much
I dont feel free
when Im repentant
tell him this much
you dont want him
due to extra skin
tell him this much
you forsake him
due to pretension
now we have everything we need
to come up to where youre pristine
we believe
tell him this much
you cant withstand
taking it upright
tell him this much
you felt dirty
because it was tight
I know this much
that old feeling
Im done hanging on
I know this much
stop pretending
what was had is gone
now we have everything we need
to come up to where you are seen
we believe
