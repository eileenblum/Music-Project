The surface is so cold and worthless
All the things that I have still come from there
So paint your windows in front of my face
When you know damn well there's no one behind them

I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
Just so you know

And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall
And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all

It's me against the world still I'm losing ground
And I'd kill to taste what it must be like
Cause it's every one of my empty parts that you fill now

I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
I wish your body was not so warm to me
Just so you know

And maybe it is all for the better now
Well maybe things sort of make sense
And maybe it is all for the better now
Well maybe things sort of make sense

And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall
And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all

Pause silence
Another moment dropped off
Left behind and
Hanging still

Pause silence
Another moment dropped off
Left behind and
Hanging still

You won't see me
You won't see me
You won't see me
You won't see me

I can't see you
I can't see you
I can't see you
I can't see you

And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all
And all it was was something beautiful
When tides and dreams don't seem so tall at all
