[*]
I know you want to lie
I can see it in your eyes!
I see it in your eyes
Still you know you can't hide!

[Refrain:]
Fellon's guilt [2x]

[Repeat *]

Oh! the guilt is killing you!
It shines right through!
Feel as though you've died!
Eating from inside!
Waiting to be hanged!
Caught once again!
Written on your face!
Self-made disgrace!
Waiting it to end!
Transgression's blend!
Must live with yourself
Not worth the wealth!
Your nerves have had enough
Acting's not so though!
Paranoia's time
Pay for your crime!

[Repeat * 2x]
