When priests become
Politicians!
They'll have freedom
On the run!
Land of free,
The home of the brave!
They'll force all men
To be God's slaves!

Church and state
Must separate!
It's time we now
Retaliate!
Church and state
Can't integrate!
Do it now
Before it's late!

The righteous folk
Turn their prayers to stocks!
God's destiny
Is forced on thee!
Their blind crusade
Turns to charade!
At powers gain
All sinners slain!

[Repeat All]
