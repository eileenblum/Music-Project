You feel the bullet enter your throat
Drop to the ground on your blood start to choke

Gasping for air feel the pain from within
Sense what real fear is life slowly dims

Eyes turning skyward heaped on the ground
Life's early scenes start to go down

Tension it builds up as death you await
Misery's end in this you elate

Delirium trauma now it sets in
Now knowing your fate your thoughts make you grin

Blood loss accumulates drains from your head
The realization you know you are dead.
