Tyrants, take heed, come the morning we'll fight
Your downfalls our call here to stop you
It's our plight
Suppressed hate excelled rate growing stronger
Burst time
Forced out no doubt by the oppressed - you slime

Until we bring their dawn of death
These things you can look for
You know damn well they'll be with you
Oppression hate and war

Taking faking lie and murder - self gain
Fight wars to pay whores just to please you
False reign
Closed eyes you'll die don't sleep at night
We're there
To meet your maker it's our pleasure - we kill

Until we bring their dawn of death
These things you can look for
You know damn well they'll be with you
Oppression hate and war

Nightly vigils watching your moves scheming
The outcome will stun ending your life demeaning
We've massed we'll last here to conquer your past
Your rules for fools understand this - we rule!

Until we bring their dawn of death
These things you can look for
You know damn well they'll be with you
Oppression hate and war
