[originally by MotÃ¶rhead]

Let the killers go don't let your mother know
Don't go out tonight don't even try to fight
And I can see I got the thing you need
And I'm here to say it's got to be that way

Don't try to run don't try to scream
Believe me the hammer's gonna smash your dreams

I'm in your life just might be in your wife
Could be behind your back I might be on your track
And it might be true I might be onto you
I'll scare you half to death I'll take away your breath

Don't try to run don't try to hide
Believe me the hammer's gonna make you die

Ain't that right!

There ain't no way you'll see another day
I'm shooting out your lights bring you eternal night
When your infernal tricks begin to make me sick
The only thing I know is that you've got to go

Don't panic babe don't look around
Believe me the hammer's gonna tear you down

Believe me the hammer's comin' down down
