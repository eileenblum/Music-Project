Ride on in on the wings of hate
Take revenge for the things they've done
Pull the switch to fully-auto
Lead diet show them it's fun
Take them down just as they have done
Destroy their life crush all their bones
Fiddled bodies lying on the ground
All that's left is flesh by the pound

Take the poser by the fucking head
Bring him down six-feet underground
Now it's time false metal genocide
Time to rid the earth of their strench
Roll them up to the funeral pyre
Burn the bastard while he's still alive
No regrets while he writhes in pain
Show them all they can't hide

Since time began
Man's killed the best he can
Committing evil sin
He does it with a grin
Till he invented guns
He made it much more fun
We'll shoot them in the head
Screaming "Bastard, eat lead"

Speed that kills sonic overkill
Reaction time your life's on the line
The faster finger avoids the stinger
You'll know it is your time
Another show feeling low-down
Conquer falseness take more ground
Machine of force mean to all that live
A thousand bodies all in a mound

Power amps pushed to destroy
It's a fate you just can't avoid
Metal death it is what they fear
Their destruction death to poser queers
Total wipe out we will settle for
Start killing till there are no more
Get your clips let's go have some fun
Nothing better poser on the run

Since time began
Man's killed the best he can
Committing evil sin
He does it with a grin
Till he invented guns
He made it much more fun
We'll shoot them in the head
Screaming "Bastard, eat lead"

Since time began
Man's killed the best he can
Committing evil sin
He does it with a grin
Till he invented guns
He made it much more fun
We'll shoot them in the head
Screaming "Fuck you, eat lead"

Attack at dawn release the deadly spawn
Burning leads from the demon shawn
None survive hiding as they may
They think of hope we give them rude dismay
Heads thrash eyes are filled with rage
The sound of carnage scorching from the stage
Torrid stench rotted corpses lay
Our wrath is quick now it's time to pray

Blatant lies worthless alibis
We know your crime verdict is to die
Metal sentence of the rawest form
To be left dying body ripped and torn
Faking metal they will do no more
Total sellouts like the rankest whore
In the end they will see we're right
We'll be the last ones standing in the night
