So you say you'll save it for Mr.Right
We'll he's been watching, watching you at night!
You're so pure you can't be touched
He sees you he wants you; sex and such

You feel him there he's everywhere
He wants to take you down
You see his face, such a disgrace
It's the start of the rapechase

Virginity is of the past
You try to save it but it won't last
You lustful evil in your dreams
You know he's coming you hear his screams

You feel him there he's everywhere
He's got you he's taking you down
You see his face, such a disgrace
It's the start of the rapechase

Fuck that bitch!

You feel him there he's everywhere
He's got you he's taken you down
You've seen his face, you've been disgraced
It's the end of the rapechase

Remember what mother always told you
You'd better run little girl... I mean faster... faster!
