Death it comes in the ships under the silk
Covered in filthy rats, evil strikes back at us
Cities fall, one by one
Hills of corpses everywhere, now your hands turn black
Your mind is gone, you are vomiting blood
Your mind is gone, you are vomiting blood
Vomiting infected blood

Godâs asleep, the darkest night [2x]

Terror seized all, an outbreak out of control
Healthy living in packs, find no place to stay
Black death will reign, over the human race
Earth a vast cemetery, rotting smell in the air
To be left alone pray to your lord
To be left alone pray to your lord
Pray to your worthless lord

Godâs asleep, the darkest night [2x]
