Insomnia, afraid to fall asleep
Insomnia and the night had just begun
My brain is numb
My nights horrid screams
Can't stay away, from these frightening dreams

The nightmare begins, my soul is the only horrid scream [2x]

The darkest nightmares
Make me so sick
Now fear has, fear has a strong grip
My nightmare so real
Possessed by fear
Insomnia
Insomnia

The nightmare begins, my soul is the only horrid scream [2x]
