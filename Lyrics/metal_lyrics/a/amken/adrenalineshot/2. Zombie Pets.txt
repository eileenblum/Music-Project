A virus infects the earth
An army of the undead
Hungry for your brains, they will hunt you down
But you know I ain't afraid, I got myâ¦
My zombie pets [4x]

Try to tear apart your flesh
Soulless monsters are my friends
Beasts willing to kill at my command
You know I ain't afraid, I got myâ¦
My zombie pets [4x]

Its time to die

A rotting mass
A fucking green fuzz
Acid smell
You know I ain't afraid, I got myâ¦
My zombie pets [4x]
