Oh can you hear it now? The lonely static sound.
An open wound that I cannot cauterize.
Itâs taken everything,
Except the strength within.
For now I bleed, one too many times.

I was so blind I could not see,
All of the things it did to me.
I was so blind I could not see,
I want to be free.

Oh, I want to be free.

Iâm staring at the broken ground,
A sign itâs gone from me.
And all thatâs left is the sound,
My heartbreak symphony.

Within a lonely place I stand,
Nothing to stop my fears and thoughts.
So, here is my exclamation,
Of all my past mistakes and
What Iâve become, to burn down to the ground.

Oh will we ever see,
The end of misery.
A wicked world, brought to its knees.
The end of dystrophy.

For now I resonate,
Within a solid state.
It beckons me from a place so far away.
It has been overcome,
To see what has been done.
Look at me now; upon a brand new day!
