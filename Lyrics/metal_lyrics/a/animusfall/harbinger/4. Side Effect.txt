I feel the burn of the flame within me,
Iâve come to know and accept this feeling.
Pushed to the edge,
Iâll claw a way straight through.
To find my solace now,
A soul I will renew.

I will escape my fate, I want to live again.

Thereâs no such thing as a heart too heavy,
Even the burden of life and memory.
A purpose-driven existence to find,
The past is gone, the future redefined.

I am the side effect.
I am a by-product.
I am the consequence.
I am the side effect.

With my hands, Iâll start anew.
Another way to make it through.
Not to be just another side effect.
