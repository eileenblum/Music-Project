You told me I should do what was right for me and you.
So I took a stand on shattered legs and broke my fist in two.
Hold me steady.
My final moment.
I will give my life for you.
When Iâm returned to the place I was born
Bury me when I will die; in your arms.

I know I am too lost,
The one way too far gone.
But hopefully, I might just be at peace in another life.
When I die, lay me down,
Outside these walls to rest my head,
Far from here.

I would have never thought Iâd leave,
Without a single trace to show.
The malevolence, the travesty,
Of a life lived without cause.

With forgiven feet I tread,
Towards a bright light at the end.
What I leave behind, just out of sight,
Will cease to intertwine.
