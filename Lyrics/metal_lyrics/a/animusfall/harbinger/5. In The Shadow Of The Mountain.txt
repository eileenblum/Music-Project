The seeds we have sown in our days,
Will eat us alive.
Suffocation under all weâve made,
They will become our demise, they will eat us alive.

Where can we turn to save ourselves?
Will we burn for what weâve done?
I know that I can find redemption,
Sheltered in the Shadow of the Mountain!

Pulled under and apart.
Blood will flow,
Under the waves and pulling tides.
The agony I feel, is not the sin I bear.
A torturous design, brought up by passing time.

Broken bone, the end is near, near!
Twisted flesh, the end is here, here!

All the wealth of all the world,
Feeble comfort for a soul.
All the wealth of all the world,
What good is it toâ¦
