I am never gonna see,
What you saw in-between.
The fabled life without, youâre falling to your knees.
Is this what you left for,
To fight a long lost war?
A dark and hollow grave, is where this path will end.
Unless you turn away, in the cold ground youâll stay.

This is a warning!
Turn and walk away.
Behold â Harbinger!
Calls you home.

The cities will fall into the sea that day.
The land will break and the oceans take their place.
Swallow the earth, shatter the sky.
Harbinger take flight.
The cities will fall into the sea that day.

Torn apart from the outside in.
No blood spills forth, only blackened sin.
Wasted your life with no sacrifice.
Treason in its truest form.
Vacancy that can rival hell.
In the latter bound to dwell.
Forever, beckons forth.
So silent, no remorse!

No remorse.
This is a warning, the hour is turning.
Renewal is coming, to cleanse us all.
Hide behind all youâve died to find.
The darkness will take all that fall in the wake of the Harbinger!
