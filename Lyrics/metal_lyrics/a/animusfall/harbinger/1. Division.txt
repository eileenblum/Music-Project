I found you broken and bleeding,
Without a trace of hope.
You slit your wrists just to see if heâd even give a damn.

No, you are so loved!

Stand up on your own two feet,
Do away with truth untold.
Youâre meant for more than you can know,
Your life will remain.

Remain in the light till the call,
Donât let darkness descend on your soul.

Self-afflicted are scars of the past.
Left behind in the shadow of death.
Another sting of meaningless division,
From the place we are meant to call home.
