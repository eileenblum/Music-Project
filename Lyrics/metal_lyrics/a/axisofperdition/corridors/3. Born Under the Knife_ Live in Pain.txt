Inconceivable claws wrenching at the gates of time 
Torrential incandescence of the atomic wellspring 
Churning in its infinity amongst mindless dancers 
Lurching to the twitching cadence of discordant flutes 
This is chaotic abhorrence, mercurially envisioned horror
The incoherent howling in the untamed void 
Of a malformed child stretching its emaciated limbs
Amidst the unbearable pounding and the stench of vile smoke

...Skin-graft ugliness... 
...Implacable gaze...
...Towering disdain...
...Insectile grimace...
...Talons stretched...
...Muscles taught...
...Burning scars...
...Waiting to be born...

Cruel, haggard eyes locked in incurable amusement
Contorted grin on the face of inhumanity
Stirring the convulsions of its puppets 
Stapled down and force fed misanthropy
Cavorting primitive playthings 
Bastardised on the ruins of a wasted heaven 
Eagerly devouring our own minds
Mouth and eyes sewn up but still we shriek and stare

In the alleys that weave between (gulf-spanning) sky-thorns
Graffiti hung derelict towers (pinning down the earth) 
Litter scuttles blindly away like fear-crazed insects
Crumbling city walls echo their terror (back at them)
In the filth stained underpass we wait
Dangling limply on chains, hung from another reality
Empty minds waiting to create pain
Waiting to be born.
