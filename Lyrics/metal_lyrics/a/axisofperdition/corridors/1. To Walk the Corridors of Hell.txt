[Intro speech:]
Cygnus X-1 was discovered as an X-ray source 30 years ago This binary system, distant of 2.5 kpc, consists of the O9.7 Iab type
supergiant HDE 22 and a compact object orbiting around with a period of 5.6 days. The mass of the unseen companion, significantly
larger then 5 solar masses, suggests that it is a black hole. Focused wind accretion from a primary star being extremely close to
filling the Roche lobe drives the powerful source of the X-ray radiation. Cygnus X-1 is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the sky.

Fall...........
Seasons of crippling pain as I walk the corridors of hell
A disturbing contortion of the mind revered
Unending hypocrisy when faith removes your eyes
Fall..........
Stretch your fingertips and feel the barbed shell of your prison
Huddle freezing on the immaculate steps to my temple 
Which lead in (intertwining) spirals to your nightmares 

Burn the havens that justify the light
And watch the smoke invite the shadows in
Shadows so deep they are infinite chasms
The foetid jaws of hell

A mummified god clinging like a parasite
To an earth that pathetically complies 
Shall be swallowed by that gaping maw
All that lives shall die

Fall and fall again into the horrific maze of your undoing 
To me it is a reflection of my supremacy
