Union of noble blood
Silent troops that charge
Forwards to die
Countless await their fate
Charge into cities of ruin and death
Sacred flesh, martyred deed
Mark the birth of the era's end

Union of noble blood
Silent troops that charge
Forwards to die
Countless await their fate
Charge into cities of ruin and death
Sacred flesh, martyred deed
Mark the birth of the era's end
Records bear honored names
Call upon our conscience in blood

Divine folly of honor
With no one to deny us
The stench of glory proffers
We inherit
Beyond the shrouded forest
Our dead brothers are before us
They wear their wounds with honor
We inherit

Divine folly of honor
With no one to deny us
The stench of glory proffers
We inherit
Beyond the shrouded forest
Our dead brothers are before us
They wear their wounds with honor
We inherit
The last of nature's chosen
The struggle for survival
Is reversed

We inherit
Corrupt are not few
Degeneration is now complete
Corrupted youth who have
No strength left
No carry on eugenic struggles
Are purged in the fires
Of our unholy war

We inherit
The proud and the few
Degeneration is now complete
Corrupted youth who have
No strength left
No carry on eugenic struggles
Are purged in the fires
Of our noble war

Divine folly of honor
The past is now ascendant
Dead brothers are before us
We inherit
We struggle to survival
We restore nature's chosen
We are the breed's survival
We inherit

We inherit
Corrupt are not few
From centuries of cowardice calls
Our noble genes to repent and purge
The weakened race
From within our midst
