Below cavernous dwellings
Rodents breed
The heirs to secrecy
And deceit
Upon their countenance dwelling
Mark of Cain
The wrath that their lineage bears

Sons of Shem, Talmudic tribes
Sacred text served to heal
Wounded pride
Salvation sought
Through but one portal
By deception thou shalt make war

Below cavernous dwellings
Rodents breed
The heirs to secrecy
And deceit
Upon their countenance dwelling
Mark of Cain
The wrath that their lineage bears

Sons of Shem, Talmudic tribes
Sacred text served to heal
Wounded pride
Salvation sought
Through but one portal
By deception thou shalt make war
The miserable wrought
Clannish race
The most despised among all
Roman slaves

Below cavernous dwellings
Rodents breed
The heirs to secrecy
And deceit
Upon their countenance dwelling
Mark of Cain
The wrath that their lineage bears

Sons of Shem, Talmudic tribes
Sacred text served to heal
Wounded pride
Salvation sought
Through but one portal
By deception thou shalt make war
Sickly minds, perverted wrath
Reveals hereditary taint

Cavernous pits of earth open wide
Receive malnourished forms
With great delight
Tattooed unto
Their arms was a brand
Blood in the face, jews lie slain
Destination once not known
Shock on their faces
As the gases flow
Bodies are pushed into the pilot light
Only ashes lie slain
