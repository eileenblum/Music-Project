The European taste for sugar cane
Tobacco in thick
Precious leafy fronds
Amenities not found in colder climates
Are sought

Above the steaming jungle
Lies snowy heights of honor
Foundations of empire are laid
On sweating backs of nigger slaves

To alien invaders flesh was made
An offering for economic gain
Lives traded for tusks of ivory
Are sought

Above the steaming jungle
Lies snowy heights of honor
Foundations of empire are laid
On sweating backs of nigger slaves

Superior beings compelled
Into the dark enclave
Drum beats along the congo
Forewarn of raids into
The primal Eden of the low

From darkened children
Priceless gold was had
Diamonds mined by captives
Built a throne
Enflared nostrils breathed
The jungle air
But not for long

Above the steaming jungle
Lies snowy heights of honor
Foundations of empire are laid
On sweating backs of nigger slaves
Compelled into the dark enclave

From their labors gold was had
Diamonds fed the empires thrones

Rampant prognathism
Reduced cranial girth
Dark children led away
Evidence of the rape
In chains

The cargo lies in chains
Aboard merchant ships
Anchored at the coast
Await the sign to sail
For the white empire
