Experimental stage
From perverted science
Leads unto the throne of man
Primal killing rage

Costly decadence
From objective science
Cause to tip from equipoise
Subaltern tombs
Beneath the balanced sphere

Death unto the throne
Raise the hoary crown
Reach into an ageless past
Replete with gain
Vector points revealed

Poisoned blood is awestruck
By hoary signs
Retrogressive means

From perverted science
Through space and time
Plotted vector points

Atomic shift
Rampant gain
Primal rhythm bleed

Hasidism close to extinct
Suppress all empyrean myths
Condone no charity or hope
For swindlers of the holy shrines
Armistice cannot be reached
With the messengers of god

Sainthood will never be achieved
Forget the guardianship of christ
Hasidism close now to extinct
Suppress all empyrean myths
Condone no charity or hope
For swindlers of the holy shrines
Armistice cannot be reached
With the messengers of god

Experimental stage
From perverted science
Leads to the throne
Primal killing rage

Random permutations led
Through sovereign history
Random choices parallel
Poisoned blood by the signs
Retrogressive means of dying
Overwhelming impulse timed
Plotted vector points
Revealed shift

Experimental stage
From perverted science
Leads to the throne
Primal killing rage

Random permutations led
From the sovereign history
Random choices parallel
Poisoned blood struck by the signs
