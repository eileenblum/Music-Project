Burying swords into emaciated ribs
Tired naked souls
Could no longer walk
Exotic filthy mongrel dogs
Fettered to failure
By a flawed genome

With laziness indelible and inherent
The pitch brutes lived
At the end of the whip

Burying swords into emaciated ribs
Tired naked souls
Could no longer walk
Exotic filthy mongrel dogs
Fettered to failure
By a flawed genome

With laziness indelible and inherent
The pitch brutes lived
At the end of the whip
Disarming them of bows
And poisoned arrows
A lifetime of penitence
Follows the lost battle
Infusion of their poisoned blood
Spirals into societal decay

The sobs of the defeated
Became a painful roar
Longing for a painless death
Became their vision of heaven

Resolved to avenge the deaths
Of those killed tribesmen
Set themselves ablaze
To avoid captured humility
European death revealed mortality

Iberian troops gather their weapons
Journey for centre of the plateau
