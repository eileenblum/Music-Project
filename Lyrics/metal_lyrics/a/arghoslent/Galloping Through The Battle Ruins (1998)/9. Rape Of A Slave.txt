Come forth you shameless dark cunt
Appeal to my mercy for your life
I command the helpless dame
Bound and shackled in chains

In secluded regions
Atop mountain heights
The mystic starlight
Impurity of the night

Hear the crowd chant her name
Pelting the peon with stones
Devoid of nurture and care
Lusting the vengeance of her stare

Orbiting flames greet the dark
The sounds of shackles commence
The androcentric gem of life
The fierce crack of the whip

Rape of a Slave
