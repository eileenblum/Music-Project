Disposed to exercise, absolute authority

The dark windows of Time, reveal my charming desires
Impelling need to dominate, establishing my dynasty

Dynamic addiction, impels men to rule
Enforcing masterdom, on subaltern breeds

The dark windows of time, reveal my charming desires
Impelling need to dominate, establishing my dynasty

Abjuring the cross of the holy celibates
We have always been perverse hedonists
Eliminating fools with supreme strategy
Denizens and slaves you have failed to adapt

The Imperial Clans
