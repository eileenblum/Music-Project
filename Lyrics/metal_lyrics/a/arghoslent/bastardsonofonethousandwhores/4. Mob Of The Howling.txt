From a deep forest beyond the Alps
Into Gaul then Italy they leave their mark
The shouting savage people have no fear of death
Hordes of warriors launched from the mysterious woods

Mob...of the howling

Terrorized Romans retreat to the south
Roman legionnaires are sent to fight the beast
Unsuccessful divisions have failed the roman front
Down the snowy Alps they slid on their shields

Mob...of the howling

The Northmen make their appearance in
The spring of 102 BC
The Northmen arrive from the shores of
The Baltic and North Sea

The tall blond haired warrior
With the fierce blue eyes has come
Stripped naked to fight
Will the Romans survive?
Small dark haired Romans
Are destined to die
