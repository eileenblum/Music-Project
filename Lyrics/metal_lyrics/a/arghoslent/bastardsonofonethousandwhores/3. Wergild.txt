Their honor drove them into battle
Taking the lives of the weak
Killing for conquest and power
Life for the English was bleak

The Vikings...

Murder was handled by wergild
Death was their only holy feast
Vikings were great and fearless warriors
The bloodshed and killing would never cease

The battle...

To die, in battle
Would send them to Valhalla
The fear, of death
Would destroy them eternally

Valhalla, was the only afterlife
Charging into battle
With no pain or life

If they died in fear
They would fall to hell
Never to fight again
Never to drink as well

The war, with the English
The dragon ship brought fear throughout the land
King Alfred, was the only hope
To free England from their bloody hand

King Alfred defeated the Vikings
He freed the English from their bloody hand
The Vikings moved on further north
To conquer a far more weaker land

Wergild...
