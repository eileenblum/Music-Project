Due east to prowl the coasts
Sails full, with purpose bestowed
Elmina's shores await
The iron girds of salvation
The captive whores of damnation
Prepare the hold for the beasts
Hatches nailed shut
Divide the worms from the meat
Swill is pissed on

Musket blast versus wooden shield
Runners in the sights, spray the field
Storm the mangrove
Cannons bray, the mighty quake
Centuries of blood becomes erased
I am the white ghost

Middle Passage nigh
Vessel of cruel new fate
Hope disappears in the merchan rudder's wake, sleep with the dead, cargo stowed, left to rot

Bronze gate unhinged for you
Stone steps, the path of doom
New England's shores await
The iron girds of salvation
The captive whores of damnation
Line the hold with our freight
Eyes are sewn shut

Musket plume, heed the lash

Into darkened depths the sick are cast
Run the mizzenmast
Cannon smoke, a magic fog
Spirits from the sea sound their call
I am the white ghost

Middle Passage nigh
Vessel of cruel new fate
Hope disappears in the merchan rudder's wake, sleep with the dead, cargo stowed, left to rot

Swill of the Knaves, slop for the herd
Swill of the Knaves
Suffer a fate of putrid squalor

Swill of the Knaves, slops for the herd
Swill of the Knaves
Suffer the vengeful endless curse
