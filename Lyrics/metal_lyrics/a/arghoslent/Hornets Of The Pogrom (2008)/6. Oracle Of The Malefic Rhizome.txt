Impious herbalist to deliver
Septic wreckage, special nature's strain

Unjust taxation and Cyrrhaen lawlessness
Bribery of pilgrims traveling to Delphi
Granted them a dose
Of the council's discipline
Sanctuary decreed
The plains to be shredded

Impious herbalist to deliver
Septic wreckage, special nature's strain

The league to exterminate, every man, woman and child

Solon to uphold Apollo's greatness
May a Grecian never dare
To befoul another God
Hardship to forever pursue them and
Their descendants

Sacred is the horse's hoof that tapped
Into the pipes, a vital source of life
Spring water source diverted unnaturally
Pleistos river briefly abducted from nature

Biological stratagem to punish Chaeronea
Port and trade blockaded, looming aches
The bellicose hellebore of Anticyra
Envenomed the streams of the victimized

A rhizome of the most malefic type

Skunk cabbage, the bioterror recipe
Flower toxins of the subalpine woods
City and harbor demolished
The herds accursed

The parched inhabitants then gluttoned
On contaminated wells and faucets
Intestinal illness, a violent purgative
City and harbor demolished
The herds accursed

A strike unlike the bite of an asp
Paralyzed the defense of the city walls
Land of the barren and neglected
City and harbor demolished
The herds accursed
