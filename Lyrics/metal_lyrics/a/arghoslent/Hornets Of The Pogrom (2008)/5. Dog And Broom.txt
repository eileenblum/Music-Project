Novgorod, nest of sedition, wall them in
Snarling dogs, over 20,000 dead, kill them all
Peasants burn, cleansing of a plague
Torch the walls at Novgorod

Oprichnik guard cloak of black
Dog and broom crest, shadows charge,
Crushing foes of the first Tsar, mongrels slay from the steppes to the Baltic Sea

These wicked souls bathe in royal blood
Find the sons of David
March them east in chains
Defectors to Poland in 1570
Tortured bones break for the Grozny

Oprichnik guard cloak of black
Dog and broom crest, shadows charge
Dispossessed of a sane mind, insurgence quelled from the Tsartars to the Black Sea

These wicked souls sweep with loyal rage
A storm of hatred, riding west to the walls
Defectors to Poland in 1570
Tortured bones break for the King

My wicked men enraged with villain's blood
Find the traitors and march them north to die
Defectors to Poland in 1570
Tortured bones break for the Tsar
