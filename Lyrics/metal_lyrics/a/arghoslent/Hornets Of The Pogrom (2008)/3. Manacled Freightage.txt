Ill-suited for leadership
Nature bestowed her foulest pigmentation upon them much like a scar

It accompanies them to their nameless grave
On these malaria ridden vessels
A love affair between slaves and sugar
The ones who managed to escape
Dove like cormorants into the Atlantic

Ducats, Cowries, Reals or Silver Pesos
No currency denied in these ports

Beggary becomes a far fetched luxury
The world of noose justice

It accompanies them to their nameless grave
On these malaria ridden vessels
A love affair between slaves and sugar
Unwanted coexistence
Too drained to cry, too shamed to pray

Ducats, Cowries, Reals, or Silver Pesos
No currency denied in these ports

Beggary becomes a far fetched luxury
The world of noose justice

Exemplary behavior is worthless when
Their crime is genetic

Skin becomes hard leather
Disfigured by torrid irons
Immeasurable cruelty
Only man knows how to inflict

Manacled Freightage
