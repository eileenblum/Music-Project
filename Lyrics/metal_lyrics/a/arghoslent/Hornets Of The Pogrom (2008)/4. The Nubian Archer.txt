Predestined warring defeat
Unbearable beasts of a sizzling sun
No force able to civilize them
Predestined warring defeat

The mysteries and legends
South of the First Cataract
From whence natural wealth
Was traded with the Pharaohs

A boorish fellow traveling on foot
Across the flat plains of the Dongolo Reach

Predestined warring defeat
Unbearable beasts of a sizzling sun
No force able to civilize them
Predestined warring defeat

Land of Wawat, Land of the bow
The wooly-haired arrow handler
Reveled against discovery
His destiny carried in a quiver

Land of Wawat, Land of the bow
Reveled against discovery

Born with genetic imperfections
The Nubian Archer unable to grasp
The shortcomings of his brood
