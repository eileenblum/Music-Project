The Squaw Campaign, a turning point
For the scout raised by the natives
Simon plotting from an eminence
Revenge for the attacks by General Hand

Converts at the Tents of Grace
Converts at the Tents of Grace

Displeased by his kin's perfidy
His renunciatory expedition launched
To champion the cause of the Indians
And spur them into sadistic savagery

Wretched miscreant and brutal apologist
Traitorous renegade an authentic deserter

Inflaming their passions,
besieging forts at night
Behavior that will not go without chastisement
Murdering pioneers, attacking settlements
Videttes on high patrol alerted the frontiersmen

Wretched miscreant and brutal apologist
Traitorous renegade an authentic deserter

Crawford's murder became proof of the vulgarity
Styled scalping character of the Amerindians
Escorting them across Mississippi's divide
Avoiding the regression of civilization

Wretched miscreant and brutal apologist
Traitorous renegade an authentic deserter

Imposing their corruptive decadence on the land
Lawlessness, alcohol, servants to our whiskey
Moravians failed to win them from their habits
Sandusky do-gooders christened the Delawares

Wretched miscreant and brutal apologist
Traitorous renegade an authentic deserter

Rejected by the settlers and by militiamen
Detested by wielders of the fierce tomahawk
Trapped at the junction of two philosophies
Lives of Indian converts, massacred by God's guns

With rum the chiefs tempted
Missionary influence cheapened
Gewgaws and booze harmed their wills
Barbarous Redmen of the Blue Licks

Worse than a loyalist turncoat
Launched the attack on Bryan's Station
A Girty can alone the White create
The inherent enemy within our fate
