Into the far reaches of
The Atlantic Empires

The continent of brutes
Possessed a class of servants
A pattern soon modified
And enhanced by their masters

Transforming the existing
Forms of servitude
This acquirement brought
Future disasters

The advanced complexions
Frightened the sickly fools
At the end of their journey
Through summer storms

The New World awaited
Their precious merchandise
Made captive by other
Tribes of spears and horns

Bred for servile labor
Cleansed for the auction
Doom for the not able
Public humiliation
