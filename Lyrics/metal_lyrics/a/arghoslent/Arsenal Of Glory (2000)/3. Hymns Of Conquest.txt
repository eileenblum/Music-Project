Subversion of the wild and
Wicked ways of the untamed
Legendary providence of breeding warriors
Chests bedecked in metals
Looted from savage lands
Our eyes squint; we sail into the sun

I exalt my creed and watch
The winds embrace my feet
Come navigate the historic canals
As rivers of water flow
Between the banks

Her maiden voyage on soaring seas
Under the sky mighty eagle
The sign of our northern kind
Torn between what is known
And what is not
Sail into the sun
Pacific tides beckon you

I exalt my creed and watch
The winds embrace my feet
Come navigate the historic canals
As rivers of water flow
Between the banks

Nuclear terrorism rescued
Ethnic filtration
Premature migration
Signal the raids

Feasting on the kill
In a swirl of red leaves
Temporary adoration of the
Stormy seasons of war
