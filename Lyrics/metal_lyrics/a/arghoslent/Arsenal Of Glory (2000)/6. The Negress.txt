Raise us to opulence and power
We take this bundle of thorns

Follow us to post-modern victory
The kingdom of the golden chariot

Tainted woman give your silver
The fine for civil disorder
Fornication of useless eunuchs
Costly act of bestiality

Justify the emerald fortress
Across the exosphere's crown
The negress responds to a tribal call
A mongrel cesspool invites her in
Poor bastards breathing the fumes of genocide
As the chambers of cleansing ignite
Divine children sprinkle their ashes
Supreme oasis has been achieved
