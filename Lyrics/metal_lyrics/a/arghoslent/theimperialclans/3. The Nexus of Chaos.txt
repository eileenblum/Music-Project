Global incubasis
Apocalyptic depression encrusts
Its foul eggs in the surface
Racial necrosis
Undergoing experiment
Prestigious are the malformed

Abandoned mother probed by famine
Devours her only neonate
Survival conceptually depletes to a cancer
Populous searching for the black cloud's gate
The implosion of the species
As an entity descends
Propagates disease
The beginning of the end

Entangled in the nexus of chaos
Pyogenesis count continues to rise
Fluids resin in calculated time
Atomic structures ensnared
Reinforcing laws of a time to come
Ideals spawn of a sub-molecular entity
Gnawing away at the ribs of god
Replacing with the chassis 
To procreate life's scheme

Be it the backbone of man's preserving desires
Silicon tombstones, lacing corpses with wire
Repopulate they must, cybernetic cadavers
The earth in a truss while birthing the mangled
