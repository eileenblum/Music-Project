Sat down, lied to, fucked up again. Childâs mind, naive, pickâs up the signals we send, fill the brain, program, all our fear. Sociopathic child that we reared. Dig down, deep down, repressed. Dig down, deep down, contempt. Dig down, deep down, profile is grandiose. Beautiful, but frail, the peddles of this rose. Exercises despotic control over every aspect of the victim's life, emotional need to justify his crimes therefore he, âI donât feel your righteous in meâ. The core. Anti-social. Falling down. Down to the ground, delinquent soul drowned. Most aberrant architecture weâve ever found. Failed, frail, deceit for pleasure. Messed around, paranoid today. My timeâs the judge, mess around the thoughts, my timeâs today, Messed around, enslaved in their way. I donât feel your righteous in me. The core, anti-social. Hand wounds while masturbating. Failed, frail, deceit for pleasure. Doesnât suit the cost, does the ditzy boss, grows like moss. Dealing with the law, and the clothes were gone, ditched and lost. Chasing, traitors with lack of empathic nature. Chasing, traitors with lack of moderation. Raw secretes with masturbation, raw secrets of maturation.
