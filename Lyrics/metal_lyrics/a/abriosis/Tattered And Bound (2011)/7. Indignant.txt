Bound me down, tight, right. The stars donât align its your sickness. The synapses slumping like afterbirth. Stringing along the sequestered light. Left in your wake just macabre stench of pain Indignant. Cut me first, bleed me first, lick me first, suck me first Choke me first, gut me first, rot me first, eat me first. Touch me first, drain me first. In line. Every time I see your eyes, Theyâre looking down. Down, to see blood on the ground Indulge in the blood on the ground, Bliss with the blood on the ground. Fuck in the blood on the ground. Down, good to see blood on the ground. Soak in the blood on the ground, Dance with the blood on the ground. Revel in blood on the ground. Down, nothing about me is pretty, glistening bloody convulsing. Abandoned the new beginning. Blood-let and hollowed of pity.
