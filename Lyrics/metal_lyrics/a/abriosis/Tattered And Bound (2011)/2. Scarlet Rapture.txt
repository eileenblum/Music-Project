Evoke evil, Haunting the mindâs eye, black as the nightâs sky, Pale in the moonlight, dancing by flicker light, Grave stones answer calls, of what weâve known all along, Rain drops streaming down, cast iron all around, Torments she creates, Tortured by her hate, The rape when she was small, has left her hollow Carnival clown tattered and bound. Scarlet, Rapture. Scarletâs why his life is ruined, Rapture falls asleep in his arms, Scarlet plagues the morning star, Scarlet, Crawl with me, you do, Cum with me, hate you, but fuck you. Look up to see who does these things I do to you. Come with me nâ die, like a fly to the light. Come with me high, come to cemetery to die, come to see just what is inside.
