Just within the limits of vision
Close to the edge of unconsciousness

Lurk beyond the scope of awareness
Close to the edge of unconsciousness
Borders of human perception closing in
Mind blind deaf and dumb, stumbling in the world

Aware only of that which is concrete
Fail to recognize the unseen

Peripheral

Lurk beyond the scope of awareness
Close to the edge of unconsciousness

Aware only of that which is concrete
Fail to recognize the fourth dimension

Peripheral
Peripheral

Concealed drifters
Subtle bodies
Lurking beyond
Sense perception
Delicate our human sanity
Not equipped to cope with
That which is inexplicable
That which is outside of logical reasoning
Caught in perceptual darkness
Cut off from the world

Peripheral
Peripheral

Veiled in time, cryptic, shadow beings
Shapeshift, evade, confuse, control, manipulate
Disguised, obscured, indistinct, hypnotize
Dominate
Mind shut down from the inside
Cut off certainly
Cast out
No more seeking
Blank eyes stare off

Overthrown from the body you call home

Possession of the mind
Possession of the soul
Invasion, soul banished
Amputate, torn from limbs
The banished, abyss

Confusion, flailing in purgatory
Unprepared for soul exile
Spinning wild in collective unconscious
