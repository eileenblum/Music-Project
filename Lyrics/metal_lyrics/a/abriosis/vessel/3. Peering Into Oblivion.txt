Suddenly in half-sleep
Shifting from awake into dreams
Silently comes to me
An eternal unravelling
A deafening roar fills my skull
I'm losing myself in it all
I'm losing myself in it all

Psychical
Shattering
Lightning strikes behind my eyes searing
Voices echo deep in my skull
Body lifts only to slump down again
Swiftly, in the dark of my mind
The eye appears swallowing my vision
Piercing gaze keeps me cold and still
Paralysis explodes my memory
Flashing memories once forgotten

Peering into oblivion
Oblivion
Time will cease
Peering into oblivion
Oblivion

Silent screams in
False reality
Senses overwhelmed by the unfamiliar
To die, no longer a right
Shock is not enough
To bring me back to the light
I'm losing myself in it all

Voices echo deep in my skull
Swiftly in the dark of my mind
Piercing gaze keeps me cold and still
Flashing memories once forgotten

Peering into oblivion
Oblivion
Time will cease

Suddenly in half-sleep
Shifting from awake into dreams
Silently, comes to me
An eternal unravelling
I'm losing myself in it all
I'm losing myself in it all
I'm losing myself in it all
