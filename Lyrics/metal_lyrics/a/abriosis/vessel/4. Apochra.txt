Apochra

The truth arcane
A protected paradigm
Web of encrypted knowledge
Leading to the transmutation

The self unselfed
Preparation of the mind
Allow the soul to become
A vessel primordial (apochra)

Apochra

Eye of the mind
Concludes its dormancy
Awakens through vibration
Existence incorporeal (apochra)

Apochra

Spiralling, incandescent against the monochrome landscape of bodies that form our reality

Vessel primordial

Formed as a point of life dense and impermeable architect of every aspect of cognition

Vessel primordial

A drop of oil, which spreads in a shallow pool blanketing all that lies within the fragile banks
