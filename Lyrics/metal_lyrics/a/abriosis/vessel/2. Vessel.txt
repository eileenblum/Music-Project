Skin will break
Bones will break
Nothing more than a vessel
Nothing more than a vessel

Weighed down
Inside this cage
Trapped within

The force of gravity
That holds me down
It keeps me fixed here
So caught and still

Forces dependence
Upon this shell
For my experience or the world

Those who can fly know
Those who can fly know

Escape
Constrains
Rise

[2x]
The soul is transient
Push from this skeletal cage to ascend

A sense of ownership from within
The thought that this skin belongs to me
All while the real threat of oblivion
Is masked by feelings of permanence

Those who can fly know
Those who can fly know

Escape your cage
Rise

[2x]
The soul is transient
Push from this skeletal cage to ascend

Vessel
Vessel
Vessel
