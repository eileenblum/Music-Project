We traveled far to be alone in this beautiful, forgotten landscape
We held each other through the night

The sound of waves crashing against the coastline
The rainfall and the peace that surrounds us

Puts our souls at ease
Puts our souls at ease
Awakening from this deep sleep
I begin to travel; travel far
I find her waiting patiently draped in white
I listen as she sings through the night
A poem that she wrote for us

Staring through me, words that will never be heard
Staring through me, words that will never be heard

She swings from this tree
Her eyes filled with sadness
Singing, "We will never be"
Her eyes filled with sadness

Staring through me, words that will never be heard
Staring through me, words that will never be heard

I travel blind through the black in a place where night never ends
Reaching for her hand; the hand that locks perfectly in mine...
Perfectly in mine

Never to find her again
Never to find her again

Puts our souls at ease
Puts our souls at ease
Awakening from this deep sleep, I begin to wander far

I travel blind through the black in a place where the night never ends
And the skies dream infinite sorrow
And the skies dream infinite sorrow

We traveled far to be alone in this beautiful, forgotten landscape
We held each other through the night
