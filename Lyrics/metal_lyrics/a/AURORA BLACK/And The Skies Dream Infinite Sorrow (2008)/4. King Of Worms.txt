Deep below the soil lies manâs destiny
Every man is his own king, and the ground is his kingdom

Where do we go from here?
Will he show his face?
Where do we go from here when heâs deaf to our cries?

Deep below the soil lies manâs destiny
Every man is his own king, and the ground is his kingdom

The wind blows through trees, and the birds sing of the day
The lonely wolf watches the night
Life will continue

Slowly rotting, they eat your eyes, and theyâll eat your nose
Slowly rotting, will he show his face?
Only in silence, we can embrace

King of worms
King of worms

Deep below the soil, deep below the trees
Under the roots it dwells, manâs destiny

Deep below the soil, deep below the trees
Under the roots it dwells, manâs destiny

Slowly rotting, they eat your eyes, and theyâll eat your nose
Slowly rotting, will he show his face?
Only in silence, we can embrace

King of worms
King of worms

In complete silence, the night begins eternity
In complete silence, the night begins eternity
