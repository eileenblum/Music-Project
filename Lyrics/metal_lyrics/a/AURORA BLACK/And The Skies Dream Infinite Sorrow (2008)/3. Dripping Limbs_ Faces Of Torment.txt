Hate and emptiness run through me
Moving in the shadows, the bringers of night
Our gift, our way to take life
The hunt is relentless

The moon exposes them, faces of agony
Emotions run wild, but my rage runs deeper than love
In this lonely moment, no one is by your side
And yet God watches at a distance

The wind chills the open wound
Curse thee for granting me pain
Resting in blood
This night is my battlefield

Each phase of pain passes quickly âtil there is nothing left
âCause the hunt is relentless
The journey from life and the ending of time
This moment, no one is by your side

He burns as the moon falls in the north, leaving no light
He burns as the moon falls in the north, leaving no sight
And no one to remember
Disfigured, mangled, and tortured souls forgotten
Mother darkness, swallow them

For they now know the truth, the bringers of night
Our gift, our way to take life
The hunt is relentless, and my rage runs deeper than love

Hate and emptiness run through me
Moving in the shadows, the bringers of night
Our gift, our way to take life
The hunt is relentless

In this lonely moment, no one is by your side, and yet he watches

The wind chills the open wound
Curse thee for granting me pain
Resting in blood
This night is my battlefield

Each phase of pain passes quickly
I look up to the sky as entrails fall on mother earth
If thereâs a savior, we call on him
Hear our cries

The wind chills the open wound
Curse thee for granting me pain
Resting in blood
This night is my battlefield

Each phase of pain passes quickly âtil there is nothing left
I look up to the sky as entrails fall on mother earth
If thereâs a savior, we call on him
Hear our cries

The bringers of night
Our gift, our way to take life
The hunt is relentless

He burns as the moon falls in the north, leaving no light
He burns as the moon falls in the north, leaving no sight
And no one to remember
Disfigured, mangled, and tortured souls forgotten
Mother darkness, swallow them
