The secrets you keep; the stories untold.
The way nature protects you,
from destroying us.

The sun shines bright on us
as long as nobody knows.
Concealed.
Behind stone, it never sleeps.

You move slowly; move about in despair.
Your words carry through the breeze.
Softly kissing my ears with sweet lies.
Oh, the deceiver has come.
He's come to lift us higher.

The sun shines bright on us
as long as nobody knows.
Concealed.
Behind stone, it never sleeps.

Your secrets will be shared under a sunless sky.
Ten thousand miles of fire at the edge of hell.
The world gathers.
Oh, the deceiver has come.
He's has come to lift us higher.
We kiss his feet as we bow in defeat.
The days of the sun are over.

Above the clouds, above the ground.
I can see him weeping.
Holding an infant.
He is our father
who reigns in heaven.
He died for you.

The sun is burning the atmosphere.
The ocean flooding a world in fear.
You time to awake
is slowly coming near.
Your stories will soon begin.
A lust for destruction
will be quenched.

Your secrets will be shared under a sunless sky.
Around ten thousand miles of fire at the edge of hell.
