Black is my heart black is this world
In chaos we rule in chaos we see
Icy death takes us now
Suffocates the eternal night
Gray old creatures seek new life
Black is the ocean gray on the clouds
In chaos we see
There is no time
There are no new days to arise
We travel blind
In search of something
Something more
Black is the ocean gray on the clouds
Reflections of the water
Reflections of the moon reflections of cloud
We anew take me away
Walk with me to the edge of the world
Black is my heart black is this world
In chaos we see
There is no time
There are no new days to arise
We travel blind
In search of something
There is no time
There are no new days to arise
We travel blind
In search of something
Something more
Endlessness like itâs the dawn of the moon
And in dismount
We will sail the world
Show all the world
There is no time
There are no new days to arise
We travel blind
In search of something
Black is my heart black is this world
In chaos we rule in chaos we see
Icy death takes us
Suffocates the eternal night
Gray old creatures seek new life
