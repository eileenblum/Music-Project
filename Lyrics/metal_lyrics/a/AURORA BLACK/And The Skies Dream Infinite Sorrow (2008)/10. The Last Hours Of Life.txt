The day has turned gray
A cold, bitter chill sweeps the land
Fallen leaves and rain pour down
Nourish the earth
Life rises and falls
In the snow-covered trees, the owl graces the night
At my weakest moment, I never felt so alive
Time won't heal
Time won't heal

Living life, we hide in the shadows
The last hours of time fell on reflections of each decade's past
Living life, we hide in the shadows
The last hours of time fell on reflections of each decade's past

With every hour, my body decays
My path is lost
The journey ends
I rest my head into the snow
Will they remember me? Will you remember?
The last hours of life
I breathe into these lungs, which will never exhale
I rest my head into the snow
Will they remember me? Will you remember?

The day has turned gray
A cold, bitter chill sweeps the land
My body decays
My path is lost, but the journey will end
I breath it into these lungs, which will never exhale
In the last hours of life

At my weakest moment, I never felt so alive
Night
At my weakest moment, I never felt so alive
Night

I breath it all into these lungs, which will never exhale
I breath it all into these lungs, which will never exhale

At my weakest moment, I never felt so alive
Night
At my weakest moment, I never felt so alive
