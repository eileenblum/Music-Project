Far beyond the mountains, a distant spirit weeps
Cursing the gift of life when it cries
Doomed to wander the woods 'til all life ends
The loneliest of all souls
Through day and night it mourns

Wishing for the meaningless existence of life
The moonlight will always cast shadows but not his
The sweetness of the sunlight that burns the skin
And the freezing coid that turns you numb
Drifting above the forest grounds, a distant spirit weeps

In desperation, torturous screams
A story untold
All has betrayed him

We dwell in warm bodies with all senses and love
Hollow is the love I've felt; I felt for so long
He can never love again
I feel his spirit in me as I grow old and weak alone

Far beyond the mountains, a distant spirit weeps
Cursing the gift of life when it cries
Doomed to wander the woods 'til all life ends
The loneliest of all souls
Through day and night it mourns

In desperation, torturous screams
A story untold
All has betrayed him

We dwell in warm bodies with all senses and love
Hollow is the love I've felt; I felt for so long
He can never love again
I feel his spirit in me as I grow old and weak alone

I feel his spirit in me
I feel his spirit in me
