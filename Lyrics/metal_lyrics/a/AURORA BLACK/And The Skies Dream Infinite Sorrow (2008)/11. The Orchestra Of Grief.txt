Walking towards the garden gate leads to the forest beyond
Her black cloak billowing in the breeze
I will chase her down with each breath I take
I begin to fear the worst
Walking in a daze, I catch up to her
My hand caressing her face

Thrown into the sea, forever I fall
Abandoned my shell, it's her name I call
Thrown into the sea, forever I fall
Suicide misery
My kingdom come is gone

I wait with unbearable patience at the place of the suicide sighting
These rocks soaked in salted blood
I lay dead in the sand
In disbelief, my mind wanders
The bright rays of the sunlight kisses our skin
Our last day in the garden
We are the restless
We are the restless

Thrown into the sea, forever I fall
Abandoned my shell, it's her name I call
Thrown into the sea, forever I fall
Suicide misery
My kingdom come is gone

Forever I fall in suicide and misery 'cause we are the restless
In disbelief, my mind wanders
The bright rays of the sunlight kisses our skin

Forever I fall in suicide and misery 'cause we are the restless
In disbelief, my mind wanders
The bright rays of the sunlight kisses our skin

Abandoned my shell, my lungs are filled with water

Sinking deeper into the ocean floor funeral
Sinking deeper into the ocean floor funeral
