I descend down this mountain into the cursed woods
Never looking back, my feet become cut and bruised
The beauty of this land still takes my breath away
An old, withered man reflects upon his life
His face, buried within his hands
Forever in mourning
I continue my journey
Voices in the wind discourage me
But Iâm old, and my body must become one
One with the forest
I am pulled into these woods with a violent grace
A young man with goat-like features takes my hand
Iâm almost too weak to walk as he begins to drag me into the trees
I look back at my feet as they become dirt
My legs slowly sink into this ground
And my arms become deeply rooted into the earth
And the beauty of this land still takes my breath away
Still takes my breath away
Walk with me to the edge of earth
I descend down this mountain into the cursed woods
Never looking back, my feet become cut and bruised
The beauty of this land still takes my breath away
An old, withered man reflects upon his life
His face, buried within his hands
Forever in mourning
Forever in mourning
Iâmâ¦pulledâ¦into these woods with a violent grace
Take my hand, and walk with me to the edge of earth
Take my hand, and walk with me to the edge of earth
With a violent grace, take me away
