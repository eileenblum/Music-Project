Striving for that certain existentialism
Everything within your grasp
You take it all
A bent frame of mind is all that you own
Even my own values are being raped by you
In this day and age we are reminded or how we try and how we fail
Told to take roads not even treaded on before
We are dust thrown upon the dirt
Ash made our eyes
We say we are and obey another
Does your right hand even know what your left hand is doing right now?
Contradiction plagues like leprosy
Death haunts you from all sides
I can see the walking dead
Facing all curses you have brought
Face me; change me in ways i can't imagine
Give nothing and take all
This is what you call life
Now i take from you what you strived for
It took me this long to reach her
Castle saved at the princess' price
I killed you inside
Separating body from head
