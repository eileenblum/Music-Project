Make my bed a bit early
It is not too late
For me to climb out this hole i dug
Decisions persuaded to me
Were just too much to take and hand off
To make my case to myself i've ended
Will you please excuse me?
This dance has ended due to lack of interest
Regrets are only human to feel
With a song to go with the situation
I can't help but feel like i've made mistakes
That i wish i never made before
I know what i did
By my closest they will never be forgotten
Facing up to my life
I am still proud
Stick your neck out
Drive fast
Take chances
