Cuffed to your ankles
It won't wash off without your own hands
Made to make a slave to the ones you will hate the most
I have so many pages in my book
You can't judge me by my cover
My content is too much to handle
I have so much to take in one sitting
This court has just one judge penalising
He is ruthless in all aspects
My case has tons of revenge
My bones wail and ache with patience
The wall concave with my conscience
