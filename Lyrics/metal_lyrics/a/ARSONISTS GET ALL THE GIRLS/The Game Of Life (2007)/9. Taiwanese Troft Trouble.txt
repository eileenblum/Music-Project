I pass up the blame
Press on to face me
Do it some other time
Just like it's programmed into you as well
To leave all dead and impaled
I'll drink up to my eyes of your filthiness
It makes me breathe in deep
Your dirt drenched ecstasy
Making me do things i thought i'd never see
For mary's sake break what you've become
Another horrid wretch
Left in the slums living next to nothing
Sleeping with everything
Born out of dirt
Living in the dirt
I can taste you in the air you whore
Laced up with worms
Tied down by thorns
You must look up
My end was the same
The plank belongs in both eyes
The distance between sky and earth
Remain the same like you and i
The jury guilty of the crime
I pass up the blame
Press on to face me
Do it some other time
Just like it's programmed into you as well
To leave all dead and impaled
I'll drink up to my eyes of your filthiness
It makes me breathe in deep
Your dirt drenched ecstasy
Making me do things i thought i'd never see
For mary's sake break what you've become
Another horrid wretch
Left in the slums living next to nothing
Sleeping with everything
Born out of dirt
Living in the dirt
I can taste you in the air you whore
Laced up with worms
Tied down by thorns
You must look up
My end was the same
The plank belongs in both eyes
The distance between sky and earth
Remain the same like you and i
The jury guilty of the crime
Nothing will change the conviction
But we both belong in the filth
That we claim no allegiance to
We are the dirt we so despise
The message was made clear by defecating in
Your skull just to see how i do
Come up with all of this and make you pay for it
I am part of the earth's bloodline
I will shove you
Into the ground
Make you become
Lower than down
Did you plan this?
To join the troft
Can you taste it?
Makes your tongue rot
You always knew
A taste that we craved
You gutter slut
Worth the troft trouble trade
