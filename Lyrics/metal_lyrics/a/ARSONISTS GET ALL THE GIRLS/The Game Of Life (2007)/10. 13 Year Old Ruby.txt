I lost enough of you
The cause was time
Gone not lost
Paths
They seem to be waving all around me
In circles and through me
Always pressed for time
Never having enough
I search for you
But your ghost dances
Around me forever
Never finding rest
I can't believe that you are gone
Face down is how i see you
Now i see life in plain view
You left signs i never did see
Can i avoid the same route you took?
When you grew old you got too bold
Wishing it was just my turn to be the one
Who made a change in someone
Now you have the chance to look down
