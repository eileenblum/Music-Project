Face the face of the mantipede
He will make you see the ways it was meant to be
I will always fear the day that was carved in me
Since i saw the beast with my own eyes
And made me believe
This can't be the end of it
Broken and torn to shreds
There is no escaping this gruesome fate
I am torn from all aspects of my clouded mind
I am free from veins and chains
You can't control me
Mantipede
Feared by all
