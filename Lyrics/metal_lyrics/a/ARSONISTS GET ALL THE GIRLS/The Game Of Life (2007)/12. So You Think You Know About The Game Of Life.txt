Come and grab a drink
Raise your glass and toast with me
To the game of life
You now what i'm talking about
We only play for keeps
There are no take backs
There are no re-rolls
Everything is balls out
That's damn straight you heard what we said
Craving the days we play the game
During the day we go till night
Face the game we have made in our station's lair
Deportation is the threat
Drink the bottle to the gut
Deface the bottle
Show me what you're made of
What do you know about life in general
Nothing is known by you
How can you even live through
This is your last chance before you are cashed out
You
You think you know about it
We know about the
Game of
The game of life
