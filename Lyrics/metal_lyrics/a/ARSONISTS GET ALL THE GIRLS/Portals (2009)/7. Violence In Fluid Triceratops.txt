Three spikes of fury
I can't depend on this
Deadly hesitation
Just watching from a distance
Makes you feel like hell
Fear of detection
Left in overnight
A thought can quickly disappear
None left to ration
She left me for dead
Because I have interfered
Dreams of resurrection
I have wandered into the red zone
Lines quickly alter the state of physical shape
It's a thrash of more than one lifetime
But I couldn't stand to think of
A more dignified way to die
To be smiling at the end of one's life
Fragmented I'll hang
From her as a trophy
In the line of defense
I'll promptly agree
Pushing forward everyday
Trying to escape this maze
Pushing forward everyday
When will we find our way
