The hunt is over now
You've almost made it out
It took us several days
To remove your tumor thought benign

Bracing for it
My how the tables have turned
I said my how the tables have turned

Don't look down
I hold in my hands the answers to life
Six heads to a neck, and I know
They try to survive in the night
Thick are their wits, they have many names

They reach for a kiss and end
All of those with alloy and aim
Trust us, they'll say this won't hurt a bit

Pain has the worst taste in its mouth
Anger will deliver you into the deepest of mind

Hate condemns a man of trusting his love
Time knows truth is only saying I

In The Empyreans
I wake to the sound of your voice
The thought of you
Being gone tears at my insides
Tossing and turning every night
I cling to memories we have lived in our lives
I wished all our moments last forever
Take back time, take back everything

As I tell what has happened
It appears to me that this is
What it will be like from now on. Stare at change
Filled with questions, take myself on. I deploy the ways
It was meant to be
And the ways we dreamt to fear
On our shoulders
Its weight stays and grows
As does my heart when I notice you
Watching us

Never forgetting what you stood for
Taking chances, overcoming fears
Whenever in doubt
I turn to you for the answers
