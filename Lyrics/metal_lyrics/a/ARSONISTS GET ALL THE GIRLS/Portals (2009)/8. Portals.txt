Heaps of Frozen Ions
Bled Dry of Timed Restraint
NO Memory to Forget
With Less Eyes to See

I've Fallen Victim to
A Subtle Hypocrisy
I thought My Word Counted
In the Mass Scheme of Things

It's a squandering Fate to Notice
Time Lost
With the Knowledge of was
We A r m Ourselves for then

My Frame of Reference
Has Been Flanked
It's a Closed mind setting
Chains Unveiled
[x2]

Change of Pace, Rate of Change,
Time Collapsed. To gateway
I Stood In, Light of My, own Eyes

I feel numb...I feel numb

Blasts Of Colour Broken Light and Dead Sound
Two Dimensional Lines Manifest Solid Ground
I'll Take That Step Into Darkness Divine
Pieces of me, Underlining, The Bonds of Life
This Surreal Blanket Of Emotion Has Masked The Truth
Reality Sets in For Momentary Lapse
I'll Take That Step Into Darkness Divine
Pieces of me, Underlining, The Bonds of Life

This is not the End!
This is not the End!
This is not the End!
This is not the End!

It's A Strange Sensation
Knowing I've Traveled Distant
Worlds Of Space And Time,
Quasars Alike Greet With Light

It's A Strange Sensation
Knowing I've Traveled Distant
Worlds Of Space And Time,
Quasars Alike Greet With Light

It's a Squandering Fate to Notice
Time lost
With the Knowledge of was
We Arm Ourselves for then
