In a breeze from this young morning's breath
Comes a message I have been waiting for
It comes from the south
With a chip on its shoulder
Images of wind cut the strings
Let me fall
As reasoning took command
This has been over for miles
I just needed an excuse to plunge
Into the fields of static
I can't feel it in atmosphere
Dramatic ties charge white noise
Comprehend by gas leak
Contradiction bleeds from the wounds I have sustained
From this degree of gravity
I've never been subjected to this before
Marks line the track I walked
Let static engulf those lungs of yours
Cause it's been too long
I was right there, I was right there
For the whole fucking thing
I tried to save you and once did
Well it's a little bit of a party change don't-you-know
