It can't be
It can't be here already
I've traveled too far
Much too much has dissipated into air
For it to have caught up
I'm coming back stronger than before
I'm coming back with a vengeance unknown
It might have caught me at the right moment
For I can feel the anesthesia
As it treads in water of distance
It made it clear
I knew I wouldn't make it out alive
I never, I never, I never had one at all
Love waking tears rather cause I can't remember
Where I put mine down
