This has to be the most foolish criminal in the system
I have the power to alter lives and fall the hammer
It's a premortal suffering I behold and only mine
Bring them to me dead or barely breathing
I'll grind away all layers of purity they had
Instinctively tie the knot as they fall
And lock them in frantic eyes and spin them around
Corruption as corrupt gets black tie black drab
I am the reaper of your future
Your years have become a ratio to yourself
Take a step in front of me son,
And see the flesh that became rise to fall
It's all, It's all confined to the space
To the space between the mechanisms in your brain
Live to tell, live to spread, the terror I've become
Has existence only in the dead
I will drown you in your years
Time will become a window your nest life's souvenir
Say goodbye to sunlight say goodbye to everything
Yes you have met me here
Your right ill never enjoy the light of day again again
Fear me cause this ones like me that you see in your sleep
We've already been locked in tight, in condemnation
I've begun, I've begun to edge my corrosion in
Your hands shake in agreement
I've already treated this life of mine as temporary
I'll see it to the end
Its the likes of me that we only have
Time to kill and time to die
Intentions range with variety and connotations
We're both morbid men to the death
We're both morbid men to the death.
