Belonging to the state
An in congruent dialect of presence
Failed to explain reasons
Held under faith laid dormant
To wash the world away
It revealed itself in day mare believing
A child's mind has long been deceased
If there's anything I can promise
They'll never be the same
It becomes a horror we'll be the last ones standing
It becomes a horror taking grip on the earth
All the pieces seem to fit me
I'll be the change that this world needs
It's a happening of distorted youth
I found the key to local providence
In time I beheld a truth so fervently
Indoctrination among defeat
Shallow tides ground me without escape
But I'll bear my fucking teeth
In the light of absence you can taste
I am not your mentor in this place
it's an ampule love to watch things burn
Watch things burn
I can be the inference
I can be the monstrous truth
Understate me
It becomes a horror of mass descent
Laced and trapped with coercion
When this lesson becomes an infection
You wont know until it's all around us
All this
It came to me a new breed of tragedy
Rid everything the hardship of reason
I have institutionalized them
It came to me
Among the centuries
That taught us to breath
I seek a new kind of human difference
