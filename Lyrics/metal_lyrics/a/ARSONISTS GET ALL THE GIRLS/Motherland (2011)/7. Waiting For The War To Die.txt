Only in the night will he race the land he
Bears as king
In his timeless reign
Stalking mountainside for servant prey
On the crescent he will rest
Outcast from normal walk of life
Normalcy resides beside terrored face
In love will he sow himself
Don't you bow, don't you bow
Don't you bow down to the king
In times of pride he'll find
His lineage of salvaged eyes
Waiting for the war to die
