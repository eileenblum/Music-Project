I've been told I can meet you
But I'll have to be sent into false pretense
Once the fog rolls in we'll stay for the night
Hear me
One day to fear my life
I will quarter myself from my questions
I'll await a misdirection and search my dreams
Answers lay undone forbidden
Not in this skin
Doesn't it bother me to the bone
Lately it's become distraction
Besides the pressure
To only owe death a smaller fee
Moments pass and I'm still here
I've been stalked to this plain
What were the last words spoken
To create impulse in your skull
Was there some place we agreed
You've got to check the radio
Your impression
Will be longest to scar
The griffins will be
The watchers of the world
And mine will protect me form
Myself
In reveries your lips seem stitched
Who used the needles
Who has you sewn shut
I cant bear it
I can barely hear you anymore
There's only time between us
To only feel suspended
To only feel like you never chose death
To only feel suspended
To only feel like you never chose death
Without me
You can run
Away from this world
A searcher you've become
A man to not be found
