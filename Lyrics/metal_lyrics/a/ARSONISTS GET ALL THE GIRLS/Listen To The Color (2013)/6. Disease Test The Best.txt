Starving in the desert
I canât believe what Iâm seeing with my own eyes
Strong delusions; this is all wrong
Reaching for space there was a great rift
From the tops of our mountains
Focused on the image,
Youâre only making this harder on yourself
A reflection asking for your help and you deny
Make sense of why you were denied death
Sunken desperate eyes exposed to the light; terrified of life
Forcing them to awaken and journey to end
Know the worst is real and best is fake
An illusion is that youâve known in the past
The worst is real and now itâs all you can see
Starved; this is all wrong
