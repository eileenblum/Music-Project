Standing or sitting I donât know which way is up or down
Looking at melted flesh, try not to expose yourself
Iâm nothing but another mindless drone
All the same; intoxicated
We have become everything that we hated
And if you've been handed a second chance
To drift away from yourself, donât take it
And if you canât afford to drink yourself to sleep at night
You might want to try to find another way to ease your mind; It will take over
Wires crossed as well as fingers
Stale works with hunger lingering
Programs with code mouth with crystal conduct
The mechanicâs blow my fuses
Shut down, shut down, emergency escape
Fly down with a fall
Iâm drifting away; Iâm closer to crashing through the gates
Programed to take the to tumble
And fix problems as if I know, as if I knew as I will do
I canât stay to watch this happen
Piercing the face of the worms
Disturbing the dirt holding them in
Use the best bait to catch the oldest fish
Thatâs how I see it
This is the way I was programmed to be
This is the way I was programmed to be
Solitude soaked yet ready to clean the ground
To destroy the maker that made me.
