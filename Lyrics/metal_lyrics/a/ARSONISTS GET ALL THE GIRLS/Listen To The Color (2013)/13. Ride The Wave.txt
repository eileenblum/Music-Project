[feat. Garin Rosen Of Agatg]RIDE THE WAVE
Walking down the street, want to grab a beer,
Headed to the corner store from here
And I might as well grab a fucking wrap
Munchies scratching at my buds!!
My taste buds that isâ¦
RIDE THE WAVE
It only matters when you ride the wave!
Itâs just another day, sativa in the van
And thereâs another blunt burning in my hand
My friends are all I need
Just them and a bag of weed
It only matters when you ride the wave
