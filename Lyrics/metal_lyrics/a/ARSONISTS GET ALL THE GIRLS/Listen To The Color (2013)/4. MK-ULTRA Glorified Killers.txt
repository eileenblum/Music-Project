[feat. Cameron Reed Former Agatg Vocalist]Searching for another way out of all of this, weâre prisoners of the war
Feeling all the blood rush to my head;
Brainwashing the masses
Knowing there isnât anything after this,
Our people murdered for your failed experiment
Useless like the times you have wasted
Trying to control our minds
