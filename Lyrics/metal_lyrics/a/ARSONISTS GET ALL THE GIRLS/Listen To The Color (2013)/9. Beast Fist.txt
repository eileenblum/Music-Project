Iâve washed down the rust in my throat with your filth
Showing your regrets, never looking back
Looking forward as far as I can see
close to the end; Itâs not what it seems
I thought youâve had enough, This is force on your face
Make it last, Listen close
Beast fists!!!!!!Beast fists!!!!!!
Producing endings to the decay that you bring
This is the end of you, poisoned by cancer
Believing everything will be alright
