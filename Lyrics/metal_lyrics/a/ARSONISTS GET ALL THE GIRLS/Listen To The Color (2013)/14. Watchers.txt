[feat. Kevin Mccaughey Of Ion Dissonance]I said to get the hell out
Iâve searched the city for you
Just getting all with my hands
But youâve put up a wall around yourself
Iâve got my sledge to cripple you
Break you down, busted up until there are two
Youâre slipping right through my hands
Not a single thing can keep you in
Itâs a repeating trend
To see you when youâre out there on those streets again
And I have something that I need to confess
And itâs wearing me down
Iâve been watching you while you eat, while you sleep
To the point that Iâve made maps on my palm
I can find you whenever I want
I have you at the tips of my fingers
Waiting for you to make your next move
Weâre outside of your window
Weâre smashing down your door
Creeping slowly waiting for your doom
Has come for you now in the form of me
Look at me,
This is what weâre watching; This is what weâre stalking
Weâre waiting, were watching you
Chasing the warmth of your skin; holding out on me
You always, you seem to hold on to long
Hope has been watching, body has been killing
Iâm aching; tired from watching you
