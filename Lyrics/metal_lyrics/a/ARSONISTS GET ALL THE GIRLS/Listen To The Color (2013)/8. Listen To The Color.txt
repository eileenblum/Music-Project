[feat. Robby Bancroft Of Five Characters In Search Of An Exit]Having stopped and collected moss
Searching for a substitution
Itâs hard to be thrown into new charts
Scraping the wrought off your teeth
Unmoved in the core but circling the surface
Trapped in the same body; choking the life out of you
Itâs been brushed off and polished
Yet we still believe to be the same as
Before we were on top looking down
Into the center eyes can focus through new layers
Transparent in thought
Because we are the ones, we are the ones
Who weâre afraid of
Fuck all that, forget all that
Forget all that for now, we get it out; I think itâs out
One more drink and then weâll call it a night
A quick fix to set us off right; Explode in your face
An overdose of your worst fears; go another round
Shot for shot, faded into the night
Iâve offered my time, and now itâs over
Transform I become none
A thought of life and the forsaken
I was born in the gutter and controlled by the suit
I can tell you what death smells like
It is mine to show you
The end of my day is the end of the curse
