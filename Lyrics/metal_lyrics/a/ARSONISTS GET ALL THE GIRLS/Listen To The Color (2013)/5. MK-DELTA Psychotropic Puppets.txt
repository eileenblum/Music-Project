Maybe we have to forget everything that we have learned in the past
For us to realize that we live in two completely different worlds
I wish youâd realize its sink or swim and weâre surrounded by an endless sea
And youâll get fed to sharks, I can guarantee
With my last breathe left here on this rock
Donât mistake me for saving grace or praise my face
Smash you down if you take the place of a god or just a minnow
Just because you toss the seed and watch it grow
Doesnât mean you created the show
Other lands
Thatâs the goal with curtains pulled to make you a coward
Like the worthless piece of meat that you are
Shave you for your wool and other parts to feed
Weâre coming for you
This is what we are surrounded by
Hold the water high to drip in your mouth
Illusions will eat you and truth will fail you
Yet through all this, still not useless
Feed your soul to the power that destroy worlds
And so you think youâve got this whole thing figured out
You are worthless, and everyone is for sale
Buy, Buy, Buyâ¦..Bought!
Sell yourself to the market for non-profit
Time is essential; weâre wasting it on your worthlessness
Youâll be gone in the blink of an eye
A lifetime of enslavement at conception, Iâm collapsing
I start collapsing
Body failure, as I fall to my knees; delusional
No signs of stopping
There is no stopping
Ready for whatever may come
The universe is dead and destroyed.
