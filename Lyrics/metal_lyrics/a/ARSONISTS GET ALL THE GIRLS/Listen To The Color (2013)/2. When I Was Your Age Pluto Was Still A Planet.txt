Iâm trying to glue back all the missing pieces of the puzzle
Blown and scattered with no hope of repairs
Youâve left it blank for me to fill it in
With the reasons I made out with a vengeance
From a dead chest cursing youth
Grabbing and tearing until Iâm all content
Extracting all the youth from your mind
Piecing and gluing the shit thatâs left of my brain
Then I see you and ask
What fucking planet are you on?
