[feat. Rob Smith Of Heavy Heavy Low Low/Downstariis]Iâve been modified to tell a different story
Trying to keep it straight, canât even stand up right
Iâm losing my mind as well as I am
I am losing my patience
So this will be my last statement written in body fluid
Every single time Iâve worked myself to death
This was our fate
Ever since I was made youâve had to wait
I can feel them start to molest my brain
Visiting when I sleep
Creep around to make sure I donât wake it
If I do I will not rise
Sprayed with sand; I am now its pet
Been so many of me to forget about
Now I am my newest vision
With a future non-existent
