Well excuse me i set the bomb to clean
Didnt think of life the only thought of correction left in a white suite with white wine in hand
This is my way the best plan

Its with being drunk am i right? Pounds can't tell the difference when fused together
Shave the five 'o clock shadow and leave behind the silhouette at hand the disguise is very much our own its tangible to the ghost like a hanging morse code in the air i'll pull you out ony when i wanna figure it out

We'll figure the ghost it's tangible to you then you think upon light years
Pain mistaking by making it worse off than it should ever have to be
Stoped him stopped it
Babbled on and on about changing this and that
Fistfull of chalk and quarters i'm the new teacher now won't hesitate to put on paper that you're life will suck you and demons will sort you out

Desert, destroy, now in the colors and shapes are gone
I will never go back there
