Ripped and torn apart
I'll tear your insides out with my decomposing mandibles
I move so slowly towards you moaning
Preparing for the feast that lies ahead of me
I can't taste or feel any pain but my jaws ache for your flesh it smells so delightful
Your body will appease me and i always search for more

I was just sitting here when you burst in, i saw my neighbor peeking on me i hope he tells someone now you mutilated me unlikely though didn't see much flow until black now that i'm over you can move on to the next house.

Quenchless shall remain decay riddles this lifeless body nothing will stop me in my search for the freshest of human flesh your body's carcass shall remain on the blood soaked flood maggots lace this meal a freash set for this fetid kig

Faceless in time now i will join you lets go devour the next victim a neighbor i take it i would not doubt it but you knew i would frantically feast with you

My body thrashes in delight your last words fall upon hollow caverns a dying whim, to make it quick oh, how quickly i am to oblige i divulge in your flesh as your skin ripped off

Frantically feast on flesh and bone by day we feast by night we will see the blood fills my lifeless veins and renews my hunger still the world the eternal buffet
