Pestilence will only lead you in a big pile of your most stunning action
As he did seek the truth until its all uncovered
Slam the book so the courtyard sings our fate in time it will just ring
Let me set the stage for you all
This is nothing new to see or hear
They have always been there , its just a matter of acknowledgement

They claimed free the slaves, when all they did was work them all to death
Loomed in the air instead of different potency today i say
Crying to me fact or fiction? But only waiting for my decision
Well it is it is it is
Fiction for christs sake fiction on your part fact in life as for now
As for now fuck that
Give them back to him or the flies lord shall have
His vengeance weigh down charisma for these bodies
They burn now have red meat
