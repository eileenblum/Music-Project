By the time you read this
We will be gone
And not to be seen soon
Only if it was as easy
Bent kness
For some
Wet eyes
To deface the
Broken
Pact of dying
Promise
In the lesser
Hardern
Pews for that fact
Smiles

Stuck in the pews
Death around
This is no sanctuary
For mine eyes, for thine eyes
This was too much

Face the crowd
Then bow down to your knee
Then take out what you need
This was you and you need just as much

Break for this we
We will not let you rest

Your dreams wont come true
Slow manifestations
Turned into salt statues
This can't be the end
For what was it
That you said

Forsaken was the path
The path of wanderers
You did nothing but mame it
Yet you claim i was it
I made it thus far

For the clothes on your back
You would destroy

You were put down
And it was the best (my test)
