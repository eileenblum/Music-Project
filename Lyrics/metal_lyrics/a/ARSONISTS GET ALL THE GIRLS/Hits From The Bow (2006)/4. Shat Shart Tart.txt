For my sake
Shave everything you see
She had a big forth coming
For what was said at the press confrence
For what he saw in the rest room office
Shit blood
Everywhere on everything
Cum stains
Everywhere on everything
Forget the shave
Do it though anyway
But pierce the heart
Just as the glare pierced you and i
In the ghetto times
The better times
Of those who calim and addicts
Familiar faces
Worn out places
They can't be erased
In no time they see
