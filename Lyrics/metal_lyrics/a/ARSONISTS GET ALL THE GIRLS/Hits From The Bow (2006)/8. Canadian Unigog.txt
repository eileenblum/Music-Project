Take a look around you but don't look back
Your surroundings have never been better
A whisper alone, a city is destroyed
Secret societies never reveal their true nature
But we could see your foundation, exposed
Battered threads and cocky burnt holes
You ran into the safe house alone
And set it on fire, all ablaze

Throwing the waste
From my mouth
Onto you again and again
You throw yours onto me
I just wash it off
And hope to the lord
You know what you're doing
To dismay your species

For the last time i remain
In the light about a situation
So this receding begins now
Right in my foe
Right where i was comfortable

You know this is about you
You turned your back on us
Abused everything for personal gain
Everything was a straight up lie
I have no respect for you
For a two bit low life
Your false facade
Has worn itself through
Nothing will return
To the way it once was
You have wasted your chance
Don't try to come back

Once again i'm here
Debating which route to take
In this situation
I descend to the right side
As you see "the wrong"
Wrongful vote
Rightful grudge
Until we die
