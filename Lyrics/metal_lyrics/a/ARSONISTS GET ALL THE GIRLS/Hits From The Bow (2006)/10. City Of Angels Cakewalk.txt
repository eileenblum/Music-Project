Fisting society
To become the one on top
The most wet
The most respected
Yet we all hate each other anyway
Can't stand the decit from allies
That were in the light
With intent to be in the dark
When we face it
We face the ways of success

You can dance around the truth all you want
But it wont change the outcome
Your fan clubs exist only in shelled minds
They can't see whats going on
When you lie straight to their face
About how much you love them

Face the love they gave you
You were not sent from the future
To ever save anyone of us
We can deal with it on our own
We dance around a light
That most will never see nor feel
But we see (into darkness)

Face the facts of dismal acts
As i spread my wings to leave
All this in the dust
All this in old and older news

Even the will
The will of the gods
Will not save you
You are too far in
All of you
You and your friends
Chose to manifest some sin
