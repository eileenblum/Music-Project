Woman and child
Like a feather falls from the sky
So dark, so dark in the moonlight
Naked we worship the night sky
No man can hold what the darkness can sow
Gonna leave an ugly skull when ya go
Tongues like horns violently born a new soul
The soft dead awake alive in love
Hard for the hangmans daughter
Naked we worship the night sky
No man can hold what the darkness can sow
Gonna leave an ugly skull when ya go
