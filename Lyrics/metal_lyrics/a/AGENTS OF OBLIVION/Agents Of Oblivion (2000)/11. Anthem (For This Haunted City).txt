I spy yellow green roses in mary's garden
I am god don't love you anymore
Down in new orleans
I know where the devil dwells
Within ya
I have loved the whore
I know how it feels down there
Down in new orleans
I spy yellow blue sky pie
Between the teeth of whores
God don't love you anymore
Down there
Down in new orleans
