Lady bug, lady bug, lady bug
Kisses the bones pushing thru
Everybody here seems to be in their head but me
Twitching, twisted
Beyond alone
Spiritless and out of context
Ultra-violet beam
Everybody's eyes seem to move from their faces
The sunset's in reverse
The devil's gonna dream when he gets home of the ants upon the bones
Germs on public telephones
Lady bug, lady bug
Kisses the bones pushing thru
Swaying with this wicked city
Twisting and turning with you
Everybodys eyes seem to move from their faces
The sunset's in reverse
Lady bug, lady bug
Kisses the bones pushing thru
Swaying with this wicked city
Twisting and turning with you
The devils gonna dream when he gets home of the ants upon the bones
Germs on public telephones
Lady bug, lady bug, lady bug
Kisses the bones pushing thru
