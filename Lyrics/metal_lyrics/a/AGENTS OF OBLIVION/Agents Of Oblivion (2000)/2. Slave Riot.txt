Long ago I kissed her skull
Sunbleached and beautiful
Slick-wet with diesel fuel
We'll watch the midnight movie
Painted with the sky
Bleeding white butterflies
After surfacing from the mirror
(where rabbits lead us)
Women shaking death from his hair
I swear, the wind sounded like
Spirits voicing all the things that
Tortured them
(when they were men)
The fire light was an offering
To the gods that runs thru the bark of the trees
I believe, like the sky above me
We won't live to see it end
Now lets pretend that it could have been
(any other way)
Long and slow I kissed her skull
Sunbleached and beautiful
Slick-wet with diesel fuel
We'll watch the midnight movie
Painted with the sky
Bleeding white butterflies
Older ghosts than you and me listen to the whispering
Whisper to the listening old grey ghost
And I whisper to the listening sky,
By the gods above us
We wont live to see it end,
Now lets not pretend that it could have been
(any other way)
Bleeding white butterflies
Lond and slow I kissed her skull
