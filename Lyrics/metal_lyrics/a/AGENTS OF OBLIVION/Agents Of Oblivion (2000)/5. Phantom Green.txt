I feel as though I am living with people who are not yet born, with monsters who escape from the womb before their time
[Henry Miller]

Just a cold millennium in
Another dry age
Just a cold millennium in
Another dry age
The vanishing man has
Madness so sow there are secrets he knows that hve never been told
I was sleeping with the insects
Yeah...

I was dreamin' of the ocean
The devil is just out of frame,
The devil is just out of frame,
It's such a cold dimension this
Slow burn in my head (soul, blood)
Phantom green is the color of the sky
It's the color I see when I close my eyes
Phantom green is the color of the sky
It's the color I see when I close my eyes
The devil is just out of frame,
The devil is just out of frame
