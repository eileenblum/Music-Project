It's only the end of the world again
Down by the ocean
The frogmen are surfacing but,
The beast beneath the skin has been
Whispering, wondering
Wondering, whispering

It's only the end of the world again
It's only the end of the world again
It's only the end

Raise and sing
Shedding his ocean skin
Moon green awakening and
Somethin like a woman
Screams, screams
To me screaming

It's only the end of the world again
It's only the end of the world again
It's only the end
