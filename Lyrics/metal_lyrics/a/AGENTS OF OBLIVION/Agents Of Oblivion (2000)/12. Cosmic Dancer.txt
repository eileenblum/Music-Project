[T. Rex cover (from the album "Electric Warrior" (1971). Written by Marc Bolan]

I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was ahhh...
I was dancing when I was ahhh...
I danced myself right out the womb
I danced myself right out the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself right out the womb
I was dancing when I was eight
I was dancing when I was eight
Is it strange to dance so late
Is it strange to dance so late
I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man
Whats it like to be a loon
I liken it to a balloon
I danced myself right out the womb
I danced myself right out the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself into the tomb
But then again once more
I danced myself right out the womb
I danced myself right out the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon
I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
