I am a brother to the dragon and a companion to owls.
My skin is black-upon me and my bones are burned with heat
[Jobs chapter 30 verses 29-30]

Little creeper in the shade
Under my brain in caterpillars hundredth eye
Under mushroom blouds in the rain
Child I wrote your name in sparrows blood
Upon a madhouse wall
I drug my belly cross the riverbed of skulls to sing
Y'all
A song that crawls
That song that crawls
That song that crawl
When I spoke your name out loud again
I wondered when you'd bring
The rain back to me
I'm wondering had we ever really lived at all
When they closed the coffin lid on the tombstone
Kid gonna sing you
A song that crawls,
A song that crawls
