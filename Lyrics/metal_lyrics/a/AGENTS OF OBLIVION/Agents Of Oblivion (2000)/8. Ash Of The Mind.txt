The ash of my mind in the back of my throat
Out on the ocean of curling, fetal smoke
The anti-spirit of time
Just behind these eyes of mine
I can remember all that you've forgotten
Grave dirt in the eyes
The darkness there between your thighs
The incubus that sucks me dry
Beneath the voodoo sky
Touched but untouchable
Bleeding black into the blue bayou
Seem like it was friday high noon I smoked and you bled
Thought that I was dead
I can't remember all that you've forgotten
Forsaken
Theres grave dirt in my eyes
The darkness there between your thighs
The incubus that sucks me dry
Beneath the voodoo sky
Smile after smile
Chasing the last over the lips
Smile after smile
Chasing the last over the lips
The ash of my,
The ash of my,
The ash of my,
The ash of my mind, my mind
Theres grave dirt in the eyes
The darkness there between your thighs
The incubus that sucks me dry
(all night)
Theres grave dirt in the eyes
The darkness there between your thighs
The incubus that sucks me dry
Beneath the voodoo sky

Touched but untouchable
