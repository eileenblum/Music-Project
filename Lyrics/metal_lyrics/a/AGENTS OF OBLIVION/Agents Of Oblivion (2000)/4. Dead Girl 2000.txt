Dead girl
There will never be another one that dreams like you
Dead girl
There will never be another one that screams like you
When death sleeps, it dreams of you
Delilah played the dead girl at the freak show
She smiles like a ghost
Like zombies eatin dust in mexico
When death sleeps, it dreams of you
She asked if it would hurt
I smiled and said no
The lie ran down my chin like embryo
She smiles like corpse
Like zombies eatin dust in omaha
When death sleeps, it dreams of you
When death sleeps, it dreams of you
Dead girl
There will never be another one to look in your eyes
Dead girl
There will never be another one that bleeds like you
I been drying in a dead age
I been reeking of the new plague
The sound of the ocean is dead
Its just the echo of the blood in your head
Sister, burn the temple
And stand beneath the moon
The sound of the ocean is dead
Its just the echo of the blood in your head
The sound of the ocean is dead
Its just the echo of the blood in your head
