There she stands by the chamber door,
even more beautiful than ever before.
Back from the dead, a mistress once adored,
Just imagine what those eyes have explored.

Like the rain saltwater dripping onto the wooden floor.
She, the one washped up at Fhinstha's tawdry shore.

The whore I once raped had suddenly returned with the abominations of my black semen.
Even filthierthan the spawn I once gave, 
an obscure species raised by the witches of the burning cave.
Come my children and let me feel your sulphur breath,
follow my footsteps and help me lead the weak unto their death.

Rise, spread your wings, fly out the dragon's lair.
Two nights, one day, thenthe world will be conquered.
Rejoin our kindred, raised by those borne by the air.
Two nights, one day, then the world will be conquered.

Come forth, firebreathing whore,
take shelter 'neath my wings
Come forth, firebreathing whore,
and heat my body forever more.

...and as death becomes yours my beloved child, all the sins will be revealed.
A fairytale of sodomy, and deep wounds never to be healed.

There she lies by the chamber door,
even more beautiful than ever before.
Back to the dead, a mistress so adored,
Just imagine what those eyes will explore.

Her body felt so cold of sin, kissed her just before rigor mortis set in.
Her flesh was chill as ice... still I caressed her frigid form yet thrice.

Come forth, firebreathing whore,
take shelter 'neath my wings
Come forth, firebreathing whore,
and heat my body forever more.
