Queen of seduction, ruler of another sphere.
Drowned in my secret ocean, no-one knows where.
A journey into depths of the long lost empire,
the landscapes of Fhinstha, the world of the vampires.
To a time where history has never been written,
to a place only accessed by those of our kindred bitten.

You all know the signs,
You have all seen them before.
In places most secret where evil is adored.

I drank your Blood as you tasted mine,
the finest aroma of long lay down wine.
Your soul even darker than it's ever been before,
long enough I've waited for the one I always adored...

...come ...forever more

I drank your Blood as you tasted mine,
Your lips so sweet, like a shiver down my spine.
Even colder than my journey through the sea of ice.
A seductive breeze, a succubus in a human disguise.

Your hair was blacker than the feathers of ravens just a moment ago,
but now it's turned to even brighter than December's frosty snow.
Your mouth is silent, but your hand points at the castle soon to be mine.
You'll stand proud in thy glory and all that shimmers inside will be thine.

I drank your Blood as you passed the line,
your filthy claws like razors down my spine.
Leaving wounds more nasty than lust's red gash,
Passionately inflicted in an intemperate, livid flash.

Howling - the words of wolves, barking at the fullmoon light
Evil - The most beautiful things that ever ever been seen at night.
Blood - Sharp teeth, tongues of lust, hunting for the innocent pray,
Desire - hidden behind sweet scarlet lips...

...eyes too sore to face the light of day.
