At the top of the mountain
I saw him cast a spell
invoking the daimons with his ancient bell.
He grabbes his rod and threw it into the sky,
and denied the existence of the father of lies.

The angels cried in endless mourn, through the
night and til the dawn.
I watched their wings grown old, as the ground
turned to solid gold.
I slept all day under the three, that holds the
infernal key. The key of all wisdom, the key to the
long-lost kingdom.

And as the dusk fell over the mighty mountains,
He revealed the secrets of the ancient gods.
Their names, their seals, their powers, their marks.
And opened the gate to the darkest of paths.

Together we crossed the ocean of time.
He led me through the gates, all marked with the same sign.

We flew over the blackest seas,
in my hand I hold the key.
And as we landed by the great portal,
I finally kissed the pale horse, to become immortal.
We flew over the blackest seas,
in my hand I hold the key.
And as we landed by the great portal,
I finally kissed the pale horse, to become immortal.

And as the moon laid its light over mighty mountains,
We invoked the arrival of the ancient gods.
Using their names, their seals, their powers, their marks.
To guide us through the darkest of paths.

Now a thousand years has past,
we are ready for the inferanl blast.
A huge beast will rise up out of the sea,
upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

If it's the truth that has been spoken, I'll stand in
front of the gates wide open,
I'll await your arrival and shadows will come to life once more.

We flew over the blackest seas,
in my hand I hold the key.
