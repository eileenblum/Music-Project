Vortex of burning leaves dancing around the tables
A faceless man behind a goat-shaped mask,
Reading ancient fables
Stories from millenniums past, stories from our youth
Sombre poems written in blood, unveiling the truth

Seduce me with passion, kill me with desire
Lick the blood of my chest with your two-edged tongue
Let me feel your love, let me feel you from deep inside
Let me suck you dry of blood once more before I die

Drive the stake trough my lifeless heart
Kiss me a last time with your sweet velvet lips
Carve symbols in black deep into my dead skin
With your long filthy nails, reaching deep inside of me

Red wine of virgin blood, from between female legs
Lust wrapped in limbs, tongues drenched in blood
Seduction in dusk, romance in fire
Banquet in the dark, temptation of the vampire

Seduce me with passion, kill me with desire
Lick the blood of my chest with your two-edged tongue
Let me feel your love, let me feel you from deep inside
Let me suck you dry of blood once more before I die

Drive the stake trough my lifeless heart
Kiss me a last time with your sweet velvet lips
Carve symbols in black deep into my dead skin
With your long filthy nails, reaching deep inside of me
