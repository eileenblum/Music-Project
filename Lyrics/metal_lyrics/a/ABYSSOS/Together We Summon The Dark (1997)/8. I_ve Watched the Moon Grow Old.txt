I'm the one who spatupon christ while I nailed him to the cross
I stood at the edge of the world and watched it burn
I've made love to Elisabeth Bathori in a filthy tub of virgin blood
I've danced naked with the oldest Transylvanian vampires
And drank their blood with lust, passion and desire
I've been a part of their kindred,
Since the day I rose from beneath the ground

Who cares if Jesus walked over water
When I've crossed the ocean of sin?
Flown over the northern mountains and seen what's once been
I've slept among the wolves and watched the moon grow old
I've ruled forgotten kingdoms and lived in castles full of gold

Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords. Hail me with all thy pride
Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords. Into the burning horizon...
Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords. Hail me with all thy pride
Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords.
Into the burning horizon I ride

I'm the one who built the pyramids of Egypt over a night
I woke the ancient daimons to guard them for all eternity
I've worn the hex-mark since the dawn of time
And I've always borne it with the greatest pride
I've seen hideous beings no-one's ever seen at night
Stones turn to trolls, copse to witches, rocks to giants
I wonder if all the things I've seen,
If all the acts I've done, were ever real?

Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords. Hail me with all thy pride
Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords. Into the burning horizon...
Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords. Hail me with all thy pride
Brandish thy sword, I'm the Lord of Lords.
Into the burning horizon I... ride

Who cares if you made me real and crowned me as your lord?
Still I am he with the greatest power and the most mighty horde
I'll extinguish all the light and a new breed will be born
The superior ones will reign and there will not be another dawn
