When the truth that lies beneath the surface is unveiled
When the shapes that nobody's ever seen become real
When it's possible to stand on the other side of a mirror
Then you know that I've arrived,
The superior force you always denied

You'll never see my face at noon
Cause my heart only beats at fullmoon
You'll never pronounce my name at night
If you're not ready to face the burning light
I'm not the son of christ, nor the father of lies
I'm the lord of the flies and daimons rise before my eyes

Go on, break the masquerade
Face the hex-mark I bear
I'm the face of all you fear
Cut off the vital vein
I am here to forever reign
Go on, I will enter my throne
When the dusk unfurls
In fear they left the world unseen

You all know the signs, you've all seen them before
In places most secret, where evil is adored

You've feared my arrival for ages
Since the day you saw me land on the moon
Now I walk the earth, damnation will come soon
I have the pieces to reverse creation and I know where they go
I'll bring forth my troops, my infernal legion from below

When the silent woods starts to speak
When you age twice a decade over a day
When the birds stop singing and the wolves hid their teeth
Then you know that I've arrived,
The superior force you always denied

You'll never see my face at noon
Cause my heart only beats at fullmoon
You'll never pronounce my name at night
If you're not ready to face the burning light
I'm not the son of christ, nor the father of lies
I'm the lord of the flies and daimons rise before my eyes

Go on, leave your life behind
Cut off the vital vein
I am here to forever reign
Go on, I will enter my throne
When the dusk unveils
In fear they left...
