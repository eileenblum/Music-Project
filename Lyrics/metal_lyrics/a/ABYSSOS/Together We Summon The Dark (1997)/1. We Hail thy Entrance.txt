The witch is dead

Burn black messiah, enlighten my path with thy flames
Guide me through thy kingdom, in this godforsaken rain

And reveal all my pain
Again and again...

Where the mountains shadow the landscape from the sun
Where there's eternal dusk, and the ashes turn to dust
Where the storms of the northern skies call their names
The names of the horned ones, the names of their sons

Show me the landscape that will soon be mine
Show me the world where we shall drink blood as wine
I've crossed the oceans, I've seen the spots on the sun
I've died a thousand times, no way this kingdom
Won't be mine

The blood of a thousand vampires pumps
Through my filthy vains
Like the stormy rivers that hold the secrets of the autumn rain
I've wandered through the darkest lands
And conquered them all
I've destroyed all that's holy and achieved all of my goals

I stand in the pentagram, invoking the daimons to rise
In the light of a thousand candles,
Shadows dance before my eyes
Naked, and with their lips against mine in an infernal kiss
With my eyes closed I step into the darkest abyss

Evil - We adore you
Evil - Finally you have arrived
Evil - We adore you
Evil - Gone are those who once denied

A dusky raven flew through the blackened skies
With the message of a time to come
A time ruled by witches and vampires,
A time when all that once was holy is gone
And only when you've cast aside your doubts
Will you be able to be one of us
To become one with the kindred,
To join our blasphemous horde

...and I'll be your lord
Forever more...

Burn black messiah, enlighten my path with thy flames
Guide me through thy kingdom, in this godforsaken rain

Where the mountains shadow the landscape from the sun
Where there's eternal dusk, and the ashes turn to dust
Where the storms of the northern skies call their names
The names of the horned ones, the names of their sons

Show me the landscape that will soon be mine
Show me the world where we shall drink blood as wine
I've crossed the oceans, I've seen the spots on the sun
I've died a thousand times, no way this kingdom
Won't be mine

I stand in the pentagram, invoking the daimons to rise
In the light of a thousand candles,
Shadows dance before my eyes
Naked, and with their lips against mine in an infernal kiss
With my eyes closed I step into the darkest abyss

The blood of a thousand vampires pumps
Through my filthy vains
Like the stormy rivers that hold the secrets of the autumn rain
I've wandered through the darkest lands
And conquered them all
I've destroyed all that's holy and achieved all of my goals

A dusky raven flew through the blackened skies
With the message of a time to come
A time ruled by witches and vampires,
A time when all that once was holy is gone
And only when you've cast aside your doubts
Will you be able to be one of us
To become one with the kindred,
To join our blasphemous horde
