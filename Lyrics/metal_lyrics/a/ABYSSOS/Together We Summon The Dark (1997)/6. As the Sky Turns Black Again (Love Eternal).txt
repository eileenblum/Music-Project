She came from the lake of eternal fire
With tears of blue oil on her cheeks
She sang ancient tunes in harmony
And danced through the mist in the fullmoon light

She whispered stories of her fantasies
Erotic tales of love in forbidden words
With her pale white cheek against mine
Kissed me with her sweet lips, tasting like wine

Bring in the wine
Light up the candles
Erotic lust
Unveiling the dusk
Roses in black
Wings of filth
Dead skin so smooth
Blood sweeter than I've ever understood

Love me eternal
Sleep with me in the autumn rain
Love me infernal
As the sky turns black again
Love me eternal
Sleep with me in the autumn rain
Love me infernal
As the sky turns black...

Withe teeth penetrated her neck
Long red nails scratch her beautiful breasts
An everlasting romance in blood
An erotic act from dusk till dawn
My princess lay beside my feet
So innocent, naked and sweet
Now spread your wings and fly away
Before the sun rises and the night turns to day
