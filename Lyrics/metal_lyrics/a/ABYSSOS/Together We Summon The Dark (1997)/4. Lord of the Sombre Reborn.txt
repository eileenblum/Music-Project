Hail to thee, O Earth and Sea
From the depths of the flames, I hear them calling thy names
The names of the ancient daimons, the name of the one
I'm the immortal, I'm thy seventh son!

Nocturnal light - blinded my eyes

Hail to thee, O Air and Fire
From the top of the hill, carried by the coldest winter chill
I, the bringer of the storm, the lord of the sombre reborn
I'm the superior, I'm the creature of your filthy spawn

It's the night that never ends
It's the time when darkness has forever faded
It's the night without a dawn
It's the time when we inject our spawn

O come forth - feel my lifeless body

Succubus to bear our children
To give birth to the undead
A new breed of nocturnal creatures
A breed of our supremacy

Come my whores and I'll lead you into the night
Into an unseen world, a world without the holy light
To a place you've never been, where they all live in sin
Where I wear the crown, and rule
The world from my mighty throne

Take my hand, I'll lead you to a place you've never been
A place where I am the Queen and rule
The world from my mighty throne

Something moved in front of me
That not even my eyes could describe
Creatures born without faces
Finally my offspring have arrived
Nocturnal creatures of hideous shape
They all watch the hex-mark I bear
They're all around me, on the ground
In the sea and flying through the air
