So brittle and broken,
loved only in her prayers
A little girl lies in her bed,
hears footsteps on the stairs
So hollow and hopeless
Her sleepless night awaits
Likee a twists dream where
love takes a violent shape

So lost

She tries to live
Forget, forgive
So filled with fear
"Please take me away, out of here"
Her distination is slavation
She's not lost

She buries the sorrow,
dires every tear that falls
Her pain keeps fading
until there's nothing,
'til she doesn't hurt at all
An angel calls her and
she's no longer weak
"Child take my hand
and fly away with me"

Believe

You'll learn to live
Forget, forgive
I'm always near
I'll take you away, out of here
Our destination is salvation
You're not lost
