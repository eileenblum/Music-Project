Be still my bleeding heart
For we have come so far
And life's about to change

While home it was so near
The road became our trail of tears
Where hope will die and fade away

Is there's anything that's permanent
Why everything that's beautiful must end

I'd give anything if everything come back again
But now I have to face reality and though
All the years and all the tears were worth the pain
I rule the ruins of what we had
For seven days heaven will cry your name

Once written in the stars 
This tale was only ours but now
We've reached the End of our tragedy

A funeral of dreams
A future tearing at the seams
It's time to say our last goodbye

All therei's left to do is to take a bow
But when I leave I want my scars to show
