Late at night no one's around
Take off the mask and lose the crown
Feeling helpless and so alone

All that you lost, all that is cost
Friends who left when needed most
They're all gone now, all but one

If you open your heart and lay here next to me
We can lie here in silence, together complete
I'm your song and you're my melody

Let me in, let me close
I can take your highs and lows
Let me hold you, my winter rose

Let them flow, let them go
Let your tears dance on the snow
Let me save your from the undertow

For me you're all that I need

If you open your heart and lay here next to me
We can lie here in silence, together complete

If the road feels too long to make it on your own
I will show you the way, I will carry you home
I'm your song and you're my melody

When you need a friend I'll be there until the end
I will never let you down
When you need a hand, someone who understands
I'm by your side, heart to heart and eye to eye
