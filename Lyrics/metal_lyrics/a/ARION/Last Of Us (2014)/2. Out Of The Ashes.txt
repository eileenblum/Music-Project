Once a wolf in wilderness
Now caged in darkness
Once a child of the wild
Flame burning inside, eyes open wide

Betrayed by my own kind
Displayed in a cage like my father
One day I will break all the chains
and my heart will be harder

Oh! I will become
a hunter once more

Break me, cut me, hate me
Anger within my burning heart
Faster, harder, stronger
Out of the ashes I'll arise
With fire in my eyes

Inside these four walls
I've wept and I've crawled
They have tainted my dream and
taken my pride, but I'm alive

In my cell I've been lying
So long in the dark I've been hiding
But now I'll break out of my cage
and my light will be shining
