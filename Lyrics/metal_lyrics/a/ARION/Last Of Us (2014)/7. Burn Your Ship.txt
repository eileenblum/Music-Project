When days are growing dark
Dreams fall apart and hopes are fading
When fear is in your heart
And tomorrow wears the mask of tragedy

You'll learn what to burn
What you need and what you should leave behind
You'll know that everything else must go
Slow down, your home is where your heart is and this
Life is just a ride
It's a lie

One life, one chance, one strife
You're a flame that can burn so bright
So shine before you fade into the night

You fall, you crawl, before
You will learn to stand tall
No turning back, there is no retreat
Leave the past behind and burn your ship

Be proud of all your sears
The symbols of strength that brought you here
Keep reaching for the stars
The road can be long but you have come far

Let all your misery fade away
The mistake you've made shall burn today

Past is but a pyre left behind
It must burn, leave the ashes where they lie
