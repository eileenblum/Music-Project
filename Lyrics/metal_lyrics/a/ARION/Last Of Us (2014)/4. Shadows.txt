When I'm down and out
When I'm on my knees
When I've been beaten to the ground
Stand over me
Watch me bleed

Always left untold
What lies underneath
While your hands so strong, yet cold
Held me so tight I could not breathe

You're my ray of light darker than the night
You're the tears I cry
You're the cross and I'm the Christ

Like the others
I will deny everything
Every flaw and every sin
How I need you
Though I always knew
That the dream will would never last
I can not change the past
In my nightmares I'm with you

There is no applause
While this curtain falls
We're hand in hand, we're side by side
I am your groom and you're my bride

From your cold red lips I will drink the wine
Just to feel alive
I must learn to say goodbye
