I don't deny
You won't forget
You wonder why
I don't regret

My mental space
Is just a tomb
Wrapped with lace
And thoughts of doom

I entered your mind
And your flesh
And filled your lungs with toxic air
But is it fair to run?

A face that you should
Never see

Was hidden
Both from you and me
I swear I've tried
To burn this corpse but....

Death Is Just a feeling
That you're never coming back
It's just a bloated heart
And an empty bed
A room that's full of cries
And screams that drive me mad
If death is just a feeling
Then I am surely dead

My eyes grow dim
When the night comes down
I wear the mask of
A lonesome clown

I lost my crown
And now I am no one

I didn't know it would be late
I thought you'd stay
I hoped you'd wait
The dream is short
My sins still grab
Me by the throat, and...

Death Is Just a feeling
That you're never coming back
It's just a bloated heart
And an empty bed
A room that's full of cries
And screams that drive me mad
If death is just a feeling
Then I am surely dead

In your mind
I am a beast, too wild to tame
And you'll cry
When the wind cries my name
I ask you forgiveness
I know you can hear this

I try to smile
But the wounds forever bleed
Down the aisle
I burned the books, denied the creed
I ask you forgiveness
I know you can hear this

Take my hand
Make me dream
Tell me it's not what it seems
Wake me up
Let me in
Empty this heart of the sins
I beg you forgiveness
I know you can hear this

Death Is Just a feeling
That you're never coming back
It's just a bloated heart
And an empty bed
A room that's full of cries
And screams that drive me mad
If death is just a feeling
Then I am surely dead

If I were you I would have run away, and if I were me I would have followed you,
but as days slipped through the fabrics of my existence, I
came to realize that I was no-one, that everything I know of is an illusion,
that I myself am a projection of hundreds of tiny thoughts that came together by the
coincidence of tragedy.

That night, I took a pill for every thought, spilled ink over every little corner of the life I
thought I'd lived,
I closed my eyes, felt the pills invading my veins, felt the ink filling my lungs,
my nerves started to give in as my sobriety broke down into darkness.

The tiny rays of light that danced along the bed sheets the next day were the alarming
revelation that death is just a feeling and that what I killed last night wasn't my flesh,
but my connection to the surreal skies I roamed in since the creation of the universe, I was
already dead when you touched my face, death is just a feeling.
