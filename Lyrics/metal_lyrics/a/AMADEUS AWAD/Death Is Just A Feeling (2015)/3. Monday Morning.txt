Last time I saw you,
there was no smile on your face,
there was none on mine either,
and no one knew it was meant to be a
last goodbye...
I pulled over few minutes later,
face in my hands,
palms full of tears
and started talking to everything around me...
What if I weren't here?
What if we never met?
What if you weren't the woman you are?
What if it was me who died in that explosion and not my brother?
Would my mother have cried more? Less?
Would it make any difference to you
if you never knew the very details of my face?
My palms are never dry.
