...right where it ends

I don't really believe in love,
I don't even know what that is,
and they say it all starts when we feel our mothers breathing,
their chests move against our delicate bones and massage our way into life;
but I never chose my mother; I never knew who she was,
I was rather forced into this world by hers and my father's choice to have a child;
I don't know what love is.
And then I got attached to this family, to this house, to these entities,
and I felt like I can't live without them.
They had their own lives, their own rhythm, ambitions, fears and secrets,
I was introduced to everything they are by what they chose to tell me,
I built an image of them and worshiped it,
I lived their moments and interacted with their choices.
I had what they chose to give me,
I knew what they chose to tell me,
I donât know what love is.

You might be wandering,
Why I wrote this song?
It's not a lullaby for the broken
It's a breathless gasp
From the depth of the weakest lung
My nightmares, unspoken

Oceans apart
Don't you know from the start
That I lied to you?
But this bleeding heart
Is not what you should fight...

I took a vow to leave
A verse upon your skin
Sealed with tears of hope and fear
The needle broke
The ink was lost within
Layers unclear

Oceans apart
Don't you know from the start
I never lied to you
But this bleeding heart
Will never see the light...
