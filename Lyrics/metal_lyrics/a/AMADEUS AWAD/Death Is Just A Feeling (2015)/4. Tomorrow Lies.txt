Who would deny
The ruins of the past
They hide in lines
On my face

The stories of love
And smiles that never last
Hopes I never
Embrace

I found me a dream
Through the memory
Of the dead
And followed the trace
Of every drop
They bled

Into the night
I summoned all their scars
I kept too close,
From you they kept me far.

There is a reason why
Tomorrow
I'll be searching for today
I will always need
The sorrow
Of the time you walked away

I laid by your side
Like a carcass in a womb
No signs of life
But your smile

This heart in my chest
Was aborted like a sin
Love was the crime
All the while

There's a reason why
Tomorrow
I'll be searching for today
I will always need
The sorrow
Of the time you went away

I will find a way
To break this wall of stone
And destroy the day
When you left me all alone

Wake up
Find them
Tell them I'm gone now
Don't cry
For now we say goodbye

I still believe
That the color of your eyes
Turns the night into song

And over your skin
The ink runs dark and dry
A verse of silence at the dawn

In darkness and sorrow
Illusions is all what we are
In darkness and sorrow
Illusions will take us too far
I'm your illusion
