It's after midnight
And the pills are kicking in,
This dizzy hand of mine
Is searching for your skin,
I smell the sheets
Your scent is gone,
I bet the walls
Feel so alone.

I hide some memories
In the corner of my mind,
I lived a childhood dream
Of the crudest kind,
And then I found
Some peace in you,
I fixed myself
To see it through.

Dream on
Give it time
Hang on
They will find you.

Dream on
Face the time
Move on
They will find you.

I took a vow
To fight the self I hate the most
To break the here and now
And save you from my ghosts
But you don't dare
To wait for me,
The war is lost
And now you're free...

Dream on
Give it time
Hang on
They will find you.

Dream on
Face the time
Move on
They will find you.

Dream on
Hang on
Move on
They will find you...
