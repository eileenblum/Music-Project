As you see the people congregated
This truly is my finest hour 
Church bells ring in every city, every town
Herald the arrival of a new world order 

I am the one who saved your world
I'm the one who gave you strength
This land will rise again 
And take her place in history 

As you see the masses placated 
I have lived up to my every word 
Domination of the people under God
Cities crumble in my wake of power 

I am the one who saved 
Your world from greed and hate
Believe in me you'll see
I'll change this world
