Open my eyes see the fires in the distance
Open my ears hear the cries in the night
Madness has found this city at last 
The day of judgement has fmally arrived 

Raise your heads to the light 
And we have not seen the last sunrise
Read the words one more time 
That no one shall know the final hour 

Prophets theorize 
When the word will end
They created the end
In their own heads 

Twisting lines of holy words
Into words of holy war 
Faith has turned into escape
A self fulfilling prophecy
