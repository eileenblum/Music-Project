I've lived my life believing that our souls would never die
We'll all end up someplace one day as our bodies stay and die
As my judgment stands awaiting the light pulls me near
My hate is revealed and my soul wants to die 

But a vision appears to me out of the sky 
And a hope of salvation is framed in my mind 
My death will have meaning, my soul will not die
For the truth of my life becomes clear in my eyes 

My hate destroyed evil, for that I am loved 
I've killed all their leaders, their laws, and their ways
Their minds are all free now to choose as they will
For the first time in history the world will be free 

Two men shall arise to rule after me 
And the people must choose with their hearts and their minds
One will deceive, the other is true 
One will destroy us, the other will save 

Angel undying, folds her wings sighing
Softly she cries in the increasing winds 
As the dark clouds gather over scared human masses
Raining down sorrow on those who believe 

But for those who stand strong in the face of the night
You will find your reward in the paradise light
As my body lay dying, I take my last breath
My calling has ended and now I can rest
