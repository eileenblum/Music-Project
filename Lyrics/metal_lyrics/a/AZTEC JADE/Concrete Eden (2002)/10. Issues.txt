What's this world fighting for
Ideals or something more 
Free speech was jeopardized
Now that we're urbanized 

Oh, no, I won't show complacency
Speak out, it's about equality 
Mandates integrate sex, color, creed
Black, white, embrace what's right
Sometimes hatred isn't the issue 

Affirmative action
Obsolete practice
Criminal tactics
Help out no one 

Zealots tout their civil rights
Spreading their spite 
Hollywood formulates
Tensions escalate 

Hope for a brighter day
Illuminate the gray 

I realize not all mankind
Choose to be "color blind"
That's the way it should be 
In society 

Legal litigations 
Racist allegations 
Defense of prejudice 
Shouldn't prove innocence 

Better ways of yesterday regretfully are gone 
Politically correct is now en vogue to be
Finding out that turnabout isn't fair play 
You're free to choose a point of view
But that's the issue
