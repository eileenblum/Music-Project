Jackin' in and letting go
It's reality in control
Corporate man on the totem pole
Live the net is status quo 

VR love and lines of blow
Climb their backs and up you'll go
Always forward not behind
Are these dreams in my mind? 

Struggling with the nightmares
Of this cyber psychic dream
I am a man that's lost
In the machine ~ 

Neon lights and mirrored walls
Corporate killers line the halls
Who's your fiend, who's your foe
Name your price to sell your soul 

Watch your front and watch your back
Be the boss's favorite hack
Make your deals with a pretty face
Lose yourself in cyberspace
