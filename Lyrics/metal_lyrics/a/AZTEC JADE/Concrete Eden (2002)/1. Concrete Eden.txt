Step right up, look inside
Max your credit and enjoy the ride
Sap the young, dupe the old
Countless homeless left in the cold
Formulating machinations 

Subjugating humanity 
What will our tomorrow hold
If we can't even save today 

You change this world through technology
Construct this land, the concrete eden
Who'll save this world with morality
Or damn us all to concrete eden 

Computers act while minds sit still
Consumed with movies and who screwed who
Science heals, but it killed our faith
Or was it those evangelists 

Replicating DNA
Vacillating a pious man
What will our tomorrow hold
If we can't even save today
