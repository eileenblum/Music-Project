I see this holy war and I can't believe 
How long must this endure before they will see
A mindless game of death
In the end everyone bleeds 

There are no winners
No chance for peace 
No truce will be called
No common beliefs 

Different religion
Different opinion
No hope 

The end of days is near 
Filled with pain and fear
The end of days I can tell
I see this image of hell 

Disagreement in the promise land
Politicians doing what they can 
To end the violence, save the day
Will we ever understand the hate 

Two cultures cannot coexist 
With the differences they feel 
Deep seated hatred coming to a head
All they want to see is war 

Can you see the desert sands 
Blowing through the arid land 
Once peaceful, no cross to bear
Followed faith to get them there 

Looking for the promise land 
Running from foreign hands
Traveled far to find a sign 
Caught between the sands of time 

Future brings opposing views 
Fighting for the right to choose
Trail of tears they left behind 
Caught between the sands of time 

Will there ever, ever come a day
Will we ever see a brighter way 
To live in peace, live a better way 
No more killing give us peace that will stay 

The seven seals are broken
The time is now at hand 
The faithful have now gathered
To cleanse the holy land 

A mindless game of death
No one can ever win 
Suffer the consequence 
For all your selfish needs
