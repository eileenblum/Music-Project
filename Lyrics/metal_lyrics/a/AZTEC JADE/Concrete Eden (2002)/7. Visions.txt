In the streets of this once great city 
Conquered again as it once was before
Toppled not by bombs nor armies 
Impossible promises, impossible dreams 

A vision appeared in the dark of the night
A calling to take this great mans life
My heart was struck by fear
Where do my actions lead 
He held the world in his hand
And what will come to be 
What will come to be 

I read the news of this once great man 
Who took this world with hardly a fight
An illusion of powers reality 
Just as easy can be taken away 

Destiny has brought me to this end
A life is ended by my hand 
And when the truth is finally known
I pray the world will understand
I pray the world will 
Pray the world will understand 

What will this world be 
And what will this world be
