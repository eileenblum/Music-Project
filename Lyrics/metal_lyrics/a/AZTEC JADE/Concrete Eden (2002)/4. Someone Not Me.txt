Reminiscing on my life 
Opportunities I let pass by 
Everyday that comes to pass 
I'm forced to contemplate my last 

Times of sorrow and of joy
A joumey on life's road 

Wasting my time, pretend to be
Someone, not me
Living my life, trying to please
Someone, not me 

Hiding behind, a masquerade
Someone, not me 
It's not who I am, apparently
Someone, not me 

Acting for the public eye 
Conceal my sadness with a smile
Performing for the world to see
Illusions cloud reality 

All the choices, good and bad
Define the person that I am 

Somehow, someday 
I'll find out who I am 
I'll find the strength to face each day
Eventually I'll find my way
