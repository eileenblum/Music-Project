Lady Madonna turn your eyes from me
Wipe away the tears from your face
Tears no man shall ever see 

Hail Mary full of grace
Tainted by the blood we spill
Ours is not the master race
In deciding who to kill 

Mother Mary please forgive me
A soldier's eyes are not his own
Blind to what they see 

Mother Mary please forgive me
l'm just a pawn in a madman's game
No escape for me 

From place to place
And cities they go
To cleanse them of humanity
Executions and cyanide
Disregard their dignity 

His soldiers think they have the power
He thinks he holds the key 
Killing people from the promise land
A trial weighs your destiny 

Take away the pain from my eyes 
I can't look upon the shame any more
Take away the pain from my eyes
His reichs not worth fighting for 

As I look deep within your eyes
I see my own face of sin 
Now I know within my end 
A new age will begin 

Mother Mary please forgive me 
Take away the pain from my eyes 
So I can no longer see
