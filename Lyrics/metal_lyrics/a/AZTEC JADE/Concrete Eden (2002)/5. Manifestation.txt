All that's happened in my life
Has led me to this hour 
I've made my choice to stand 
Before you to challenge history

It's time to seize our destiny
Events have gone as planned 
Tonight will always be remembered
The eve of Liberty 

Acts of degradation
Frozen one by one 
I won't forget you again 
I'm not afraid of you this time 

I've struggled all my life to overcome
The pain of all my childhood years
Pray for me my fiends I cannot bear to lose 

Join me in victory 
Our strength will come 
From the hearts of the masses 
The day will be our's my fiends 

We'll take this world for our humanity
And dignity will be ours
We'll break these chains 
That bind us to our enemies
We'll take this world 

I remember long ago 
When I held her in my arms 
How I fought the tide of life that night
How I yearned to be set free 

On the beach that stormy night
I tried to say the words 
To tell her of my love for her
Instead I said goodbye 

But it was so long ago 
All my life to serve the calling that I hear
Though I buried all my deepest regrets
I remember you now
