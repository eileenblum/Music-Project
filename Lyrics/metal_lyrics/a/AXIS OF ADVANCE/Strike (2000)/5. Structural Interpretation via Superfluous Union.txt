Before arrival, the shores of Europa were seen
I tested that land, saw things I could not believe
Devastation and gloom, the humans ground into the soils
Children stacked in piles, bodies used for coal

Although in chaos, a government had control
A Germanic old world army, allied with the south
The eastern plane was still a threat
War continued periodically with weekly air raids

Fully aware of my calling for death
I left that place and made well south
The deserts here were full of the sounds
Of nothing short of the planet's final breath (breathe)

"10,000 years ago, 5 huge pyramids were created 
In the resemblance of the hunter's constellation
...A constallation which consists of 7 suns"

Two more structures must be built
To complete the portal
Left by the dying un-earthly race
This task is not possible without the
Culmination of many hands
Slaves are an option I would employ
If the power was at my disposal

Fucking mad

I must be a fool for coming this far
On hope alone, my voyage was for nothing
My hate radiated viciously
But it is never alone... I feel someone else's near

After a fit of hopeless rage I track the scent
Hate of this kind is rare in a man
I'm closer now, a figure is before me
Astonishingly, it is but a boy of ten!

"Tell me son, what is thy name"
"Ouodo"

My throat tightened from this just reward
A bond had been created from the dust of the world
The plan can now be embarked on
Carried out and finalized

This child has a gift that I can't quite control
And it would be useful when properly handled
His ability was manipulation of telekinetic properties

As time can mend, time will destroy
Indecipherable words carved by hands dissimilar to mine
But the calling was made and it's purpose will serve
The end of all mankind is the word

Formulae determine water demands
As Ouodo grows, his efficiency shines
The pressures fall and hydrogen ox paves the way

Stones of this size can be simple to move as the topography dictates the easiest route
4 year pass and the pyramid south is completed

The sign will live on

"It is known that heaven on earth as it was intended 
Will not transpire without the actual destruction of it"

The final structure must be built to complete the portal
Left by the dying unearthly race
This task now possible without
A many handed culmination
The solution is worth the inadvertent
Atmospheric disturbances
