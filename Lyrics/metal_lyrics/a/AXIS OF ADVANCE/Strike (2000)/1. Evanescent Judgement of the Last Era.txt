Earliest relevant records recall
An eastern double isle
It ended in the 2nd global war
It was the beginning of the earth sun era

The world would never be the same
Devastation, war and plague
When it was over, order never came
Kingdoms 'united' under a fallous blue flag

Cold countries lived in fear
Global conflict ever near
Although militarily inactive
The 3 largest nations plotted to ruin each other

The new land to the west, the old world in the centre
And the eastern plane: three incompatible societies

Idealogy the reason, the new and old lands fought
No blood was shed, but a weapons race procured
All eyes turned to these great powers
To maintain the balance of peace

No attention was paid to the eastern plane
Thought backwars, it was ignored

Revolution caused the old kingdom's fall and collapse
The new land declared itself the victor

But the weapons, naturally, still remained
And a northern alliance passed as law
The world saw unprecedented growth
In the east, mistrusting and scared men picked up their arms

My father is said to have seen the whole thing
The great death that was soon to come

The now delicate structure of stability soon fell
The fallen kingdom of old tried to make eastern amends
Peace may have lasted two weeks and one day
But the new land simply couldn't wait

Rows of earth suns burned, the sky turned black
No society survived the 2-day attack
