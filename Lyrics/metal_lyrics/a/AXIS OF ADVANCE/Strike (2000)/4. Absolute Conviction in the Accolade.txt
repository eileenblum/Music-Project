Needles piercing my frame from all directions
Body thrashing, head collapsing, pressure building
Paralyzing fear and helplessness like nothing seen before

All my life passes by in a tiny flicker
Was it real, all I feel, or all I felt is changing fast
Faster, faster, pulling me down pushing me up all at once

Vision accelerated one million fold
I see all my father's dreams
My mother dying in a cave
My body growing, my mind expanding
Too much knowledge, not enough knowledge

Brought to bear, the truths surrounding the soul
A destiny presented itself to me
No thought is necessary now
I will go to this earthly place to gain unearthly strength

Egypt, Egypt, Egypt
From the vortex land Elmreckt and I returned
Our land looks so ordinary and old
There is nothing here to quench my new thirst
The lord and I bid each other farewell and separate
I now must find transportation to that far away dark continent
