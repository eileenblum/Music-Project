Master order - ever watchful, the eye
Unrelenting; all directions, all times
Master order - doing what it does best to survive
Unrelenting; human coal keeping it alive

Two of them are about me they smell like outside (the rain)
I must be lying on the floor so huge they appear to be
One eye still working I blink it and they see
Faces blackened out by cloaks but I know they see

A draft not felt in so long
Awakens senses dormant eternal
Coldest air upon naked nerves
Machines pity not even those most wretched

One has a gourd in grasp with water it is filled
The other holds a cask scenting of broth "Obey to live obey" they command

Life of pain, breathing death, choking fear - thundering - nothing remains
Agony for the heretic, total loss - tempest beseiged - nothing gained

My throat too dry to respond
Somehow they know this and place a cold device on my temple; one that speaks 
thoughts

There is no emotion - no lying, no hiding, no escape
All directions, all times, forever
Humanity is the weakest link in the chain
Broken at long last

Garble comes out at first then half-words...

[then random words, muffled sounding then "Obey to live obey kill me"]
