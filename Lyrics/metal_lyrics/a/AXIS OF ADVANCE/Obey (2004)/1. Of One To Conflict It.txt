After adopting total rule
Full control of all world matter
All living, all mech, altogether
they will learn that I hate them

Never utter the word surrender reprobated to a life of hate
Bond servant to the forceful machine rise and reciprocate this pain

True or false, real or fake - it matters not; it never will
Never know when it shall adjudicate or exemplify

It knows because it sees all from our births to our ashes
Human kind is the slave to the God-Eye it watches ever, and never sleeps

(We are)Single filing, never speaking
Raining, shining, night, day - faceless drones plodding on and on
The air you breathe, the only thing that's free
No purpose, no will, shells of what once was ours

Ever fear and ever dread faceless, lifeless drone I was
A burden, great, has brought me from my knees to my feet
Stand up!

Mystified... Hypnotized... All mankind
I DEFY (OF) I DEFY (ONE) I DEFY (TO) I DEFY (CONFLICT) I DEFY (IT)

I will no longer bear it
I must rise alone
While there is still time
While this hate is still mine
