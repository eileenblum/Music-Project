X marks this day in the darkness, but within its view
The blood from my boot lace garotte comes clean in a gutter wash

Middle aged wretched whore
Faceless, nameless, penniless
Lying down, rictus twisted
Extinguished from a long misery

Sleep comes easy this night
As a gear in life shifts
They will emerge from the metal caves
Punishment's mystery revealed

The day of XX waiting they come not
Choose they, to ignore? Or does it not know?

Fear turns to anger... Turns to hate
Revolution Decimation
Something is furious... It's in us... It fears us

Feeling the blood, oh, the blood
A useless, nameless old man's blood

As he drops, I stand waiting they do not come
Like a stone, does it not see? It makes me hate it even more

XXX the will to kill reality the final decamp
Winds of variance; Rising force blood lust for invincibility

A garotte turned to a poniard and now a gun
Revolution Decimation
