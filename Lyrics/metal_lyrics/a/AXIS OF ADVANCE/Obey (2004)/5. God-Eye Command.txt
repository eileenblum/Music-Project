"Hereby you, K479I0015, are summonsed to ladder transfer, begin 0100-101 from 001-0110"

It dropped the file into my trembling hands
Its voice... Colder than ice
Its cloak... Blacker than night
Its face... Shrouded in hood
It left as suddenly as it came... And was gone

I plugged the note into the eye-net; a mech photo file detail
All those faceless, worthless wretches given faces, names, through ID tags

The second part of the file was new faces, new ID tags
Never seen any before: None smiling, old or young

It wants me to kill
I hate it hates me
Staring at the lens I cry, I'll start tomorrow

OBEY... TO LIVE... OBEY

The third &amp; final section was an audetail file
The worlds enounced slowly, methodically
"Obey to live obey to live obey to live obey"

It wants me to kill
I hate it hates me
Spitting at the lens I cry I'll stop tomorrow
