To revolt is to conform
The game of mine now it's rule
The escape becomes the brig
A step ahead - what was mine belongs to it

Black blood of corruption, filled with hate
Overflowing, pumping in my sickly veins
Thickening and boiling, pressure of rage
In a cage, life leading to rampage
If I stop now, what will they do?
Will they see, will they care?
Rancor, anguish, suffering, dread

Y marks this day: no more killing
Anticipating, staring at the lens
Praying for war, praying for death
Wanting for pain, wishing to die, but speaking not

In wait lie, In wait lie, reverse the curse, from the inside
In wait lie, waiting to die, give me my war, cowards

Praying for war... Praying for death...
Wanting for pain... wishing to die...
Minding the kills... Hearing the calls...
Fearing no hell... In wait I lie so still...

A grin besmears my clammy face
As rain trickles down my slitdow
The cold relieves my hot head
At least I know they're coming
