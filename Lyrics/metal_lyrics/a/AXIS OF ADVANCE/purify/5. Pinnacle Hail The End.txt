Hatred and destruction: the fists of revelation
Singular vision of escaping human misery
Wanton self-evolution, combined with indescribable power
The planet once of millions upon billions is reduced to cosmic dust.

The hands of a man made that world
The will of a man unmade that world
The wisp of a hand, all it took
Unlocking the door to immortality amongst dimensions

Ruthless world laid to eternal sleep
For a second, the crying of sheep
For a second, a voice from the deep
And then silence.

Vacuum of vapor, the only clue of a tomb
Fortunate enough to have been ripped from the womb
Such was the climax, humanity's final doom
Oh, the sweet silence

Hail the end

Stubborn to the end, some Germans made it out
A new world to take - Thy Kromna 24
Repopulate they will; purify; baptism of fire!

The hands of man build a new world
The minds of mankind empower their will
Destruction/Creation: identical over time
That's the true nature of immortality amongst dimensions
