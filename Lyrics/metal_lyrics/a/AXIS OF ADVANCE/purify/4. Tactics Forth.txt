Organize!
Discipline yourselves!
Release the hounds!
The hunt is on!

Proposition put forth, rejection complete, now we're in the game
Resistance assured, a final push, the second stage remains
Those who would call, a purpose to fall, watch us in dismay
Scattered, tattered, inferior planners collapse under our strain

Advantage clear, all but not too near, a negotiations route is found
Although human, flesh and bone, our minds are keen and sound
Lacking the distraction of the everyman, our superiority is acute
Crushing the enemy in a single move, brutal and absolute

Those who stand up with the the will to fight and
Come out of the shadows, into enemy light
Are fearless and unhindered when exposed
Gather your courage and arm yourselves!
Clear your minds and prepare for hell!
And we'll put our tactics forth

As they fall, we laugh at their cries
The hunt is over, we celebrate tonight

Proposition put forth, rejection complete, now we're in the game
Resistance assured, a final push, the second stage remains
Those who would call, a purpose to fall, watch us in dismay
Scattered, tattered, inferior planners collapse under our strain

Those who stand up with the the will to fight and
Come out of the shadows, into enemy light
Are fearless and unhindered when exposed
Gather your courage and arm yourselves!
Clear your minds and prepare for hell!
And we'll put our tactics forth
