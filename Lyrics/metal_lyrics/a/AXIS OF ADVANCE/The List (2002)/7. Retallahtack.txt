Fierce battles open up in the streets
An infinite timespan of hateful attrition
There is no greater possible honour among men
Than to explode as a martyr

Volatility known as a pure existence
We will kill them with rocks or rockets
We will destroy them where they live
We will not rest until they are dust

Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of ages

Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of ages

Expert disposal of unwanted infesters
Kill as one for god
A half-ridden structure of militancy
We will never rest until they are razed

Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of ages

Mothers send us your sons
Paradise is waiting, our chances escaping
Total resistance, the truest experience
Delivering the holy wrath of ages
