Bleed the cowards
Confusion acceptable to the command
No weapons, set the example
The enemy will waste ammunition, then we attack (attack)
Hurrah!

Your pitiful grievances are unimportant
As fires rage in the hearts and minds
The slaughter is a necessary means of total war, merciless

Sacrifice, wave on wave, charge with blade
All eyes upon you as you
Sacrifice, give us your lives, falling on cries
Of hatred for the enemies of the
Sacrifice, the dead see nothing
There is no heaven, nor a god
Sacrifice, you are the property of the state
Do your duty or die without honour

The dirty greys are at it again
Their proficieny is clever but fruitless
We have ten times the men
Ten times the power to kill them all

Those who run back to our lines
Are riddled by our frontal guard
The next wave prepares to go into the grinder
As the example has been preset
Hurrah!

Advance the inevitable road
Over corpses in piling droves
We will always have ten times the men
Ten times the power to kill them all
