Silence, a napping world awakens
A new dawn that will bring nothing but pain

Guidance through incompetent fools
World "powers" collapse under the new rule
Of a power seduced by a single thought of victory
Weakened by a pronounced sense of fear
Smaller nations are starting to disappear
Under the sunwheel that fortells this fate in infamy

War comes fast as diplomacy fails
Humanity's weakness incapable of stopping
The lust for the darkest path to victory

Ashes of razed cities, rivers of blood
The smell of corpses rotting day and night
The mincer pushes forward, relentlessly

The natural law, upon all laws of nature rest
The struggle for existence
For victory
Bombs dropping every night
What is to be attained must be fought for
Conquest the law broadening hostility

Gone are the ways of combat honour
Terrain cratered like the moon
As far as the eye can see, for victory

Blood of the earth drained high and dry
Smoke rises into blackened skies
Feeding the insatiable hunger of supremacy

Silence, the scars of war are all that remains
