You have to question everything
You will figure out you've been lied to
our Media will never give us the facts
they will disguise the truth
for as long as they can

we have questions and we want answers
right now
if you think by not informing us
that we wont find out
the ones in control think they master deception
they doubt we will get wise
but we will expose the truth
for our selves

we will not beLIEve another false story
why must you always mask the problems amongst us
cover up corruption behind closed doors
you cannot scare us from finding the truth

We wont run away from the tactics
we refuse to be afraid of authority
when will you wake up to see
that we the people
arent as blind as we seem

we have questions and we want answers
right now
if you think by not informing us
that we wont find out
the ones in control think they master deception
they doubt we will get wise
but we will expose the truth
expose the truth
