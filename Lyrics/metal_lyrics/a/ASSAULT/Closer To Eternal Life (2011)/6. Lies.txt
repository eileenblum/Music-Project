YOU R SISTERS BLOOD ON MY HANDS
SHE DID NT FOLLOW MY DEMANDS
CAUGHT IN THE LINE OF FIRE
SHE WAS MY ONLY DESIRE

WITH FURIOUS RAGE I CAUGHT HER EYE
AS SHE WAS TELLING I LIE
SHE MADE MY GO DOWN THIS PATH
THE BITCH UNLEASHED THE DEVILS WRATH
SHE MADE MY GO DOWN THIS PATH
THE BITCH UNLEASHED THE DEVILS WRATH

I CAN T CONTROL WHAT I FEEL
AND EVERYTHING JUST SEEMS UNREAL
AS I GRAB HER BY THE NECK
AM I READY TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP?

SHE MADE ME LIKE THIS-
SHE MADE ME EVIL
THE WAY I SEE IT
WE WILL NEVER GET EVEN
MY SOUL IS NUMB!
HER SKIN I GETTING COLD AS FEAR TAKES HOLD

FOOL ME ONCE
FOOL MY TWICE
A DEAD WHORE TELLS NO LIES
SO HERE I STAND
WITH YOU R SISTERS BLOOD ON MY HANDS

SO HERE I STAND
WITH YOU R SISTERS BLOOD ON MY HANDS!
