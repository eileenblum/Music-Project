THEY PROWL THROUGH THE NIGHT
THEY PROWL FOR THE ANTICHRIST
IN SEARCH OF THOSE TO SACRIFICE
THEY BRING BLACK LIGHT

PREDATORS OF DEATH ENTERS LIFE
PRAYERS AND LIES BECOME SILENT
NO WHERE TO RUN, NO WHERE TO HIDE
PRAYERS AND LIES BECOME SILENT
CREATURES WITHOUT SOULS WATCHING YOU
SHADOWS OF DEATH CARESSING YOU

DARKNESS COMING UP FROM BEHIND
THAT FEELING RUNNING DOWN YOUR SPINE

DARKNESS COMING UP FROM BEHIND
THAT FEELING RUNNING DOWN YOUR SPINE

THEY MAKE THE WEEK SCREAM IN FEAR
AND THE STRONG TO SEE THEM CLEAR
THE BEAUTY THAT HIDES IN DARKNESS
AND SEDUCING POWERS SHALL LEAD THE WAY
NO WHERE TO RUN, NO WHERE TO HIDE
PRAYERS AND LIES BECOME SILENT
SATANIC WILL RUNNING THROUGH YOUR VEINS
PRAYERS AND LIES BECOME SILENT

THEY PROWL THROUGH THE NIGHT
SEARCHING FOR THE ANTICHRIST
