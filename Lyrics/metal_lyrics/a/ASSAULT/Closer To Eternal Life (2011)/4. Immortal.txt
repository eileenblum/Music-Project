WHO ARE YOU?
SHUT YOUR MOUTH
AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
COME CLOSER HERE
I'LL BREAK YOUR BONES AND PEEL YOUR SKIN
I HATE YOU ALL
YOU GET ON MY NERVES
I CAN T CONTROL MYSELF NO MORE
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
DO YOU WANT TO FIGHT?
I WILL BREAK YOU FUCKING NECK!

YOU WALK AROUND
AND THINK YOU'RE TOUGH
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT I AM
WHAT I LL DO
IF YOU PUSH ME
AND I WILL GET MY HANDS ON YOU
I LL DRAIN YOUR HEART
HANG YOU UPSIDE DOWN AND TEAR YOU APART
FUCK YOU!!!!
BRING YOUR FRIENDS
NOW IT'S AWAKE AND WAITING FOR YOU

BRING IT ON
YOU CAN T HURT ME
GREAT POWERS OF THE DARK FUELS ME
MY FLAME BURNS STRONG
I'M GIVING IN
NOW I AM AWAKE AND I AM ALIVE
I'LL BREAK YOUR ARMS
BREAK YOUR LEGS
SPREAD MY WINGS AND TAKE YOUR LIFE
DO YOU SEE ME NOW
FOR WHAT I AM
THE FIRE IN MY EYES BURNS FROM MY SOUL

I GROW TALL AND STRONG
AND THE BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS SETS ME FREE
I AM LOSING MYSELF TO LIVE
IMMORTALITY!

BRING IT ON
YOU CAN T HURT ME
GREAT POWERS OF THE DARK FUELS ME
MY FLAME BURNS STRONG
I'M GIVING IN
NOW I AM AWAKE AND I AM ALIVE
I'LL BREAK YOUR ARMS
BREAK YOUR LEGS
SPREAD MY WINGS AND TAKE YOUR LIFE
DO YOU SEE ME NOW
FOR WHAT I AM
THE FIRE IN MY EYES BURNS FROM MY SOUL
