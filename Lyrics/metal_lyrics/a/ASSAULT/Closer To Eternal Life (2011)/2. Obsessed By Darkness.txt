SITTING ALONE AND WAITING
WAITING FOR IT TO ARRIVE
WAITING FOR IT TO TAKE CONTROL
THE SNOW IS FALLING SILENT OUTSIDE
AND I CAN FEEL IT APPROACHING
SURROUNDING ME
AND IT FILLS MY HEART WITH BLACK!

I WANT IT
WANT IT ALL
I NEED IT
NEED IT ALL
I AM SURRENDERING MY SOUL
AND GIVING YOU ALL

YOU SCARE ME
YOU WILL HURT ME
BUT I WANT YOU CLOSE
I WON T STRUGGLE OR GIVE IN FOR PAIN
JUST COVER MY EYES AND LEAD ME AWAY!

I PLEAD GUILTY BY CUTTING MYSELF
AND GIVING ME AWAY...

WE'RE ALONE NOW AND I CAN FEEL THE COLD
REACHING FOR MY SOUL
YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW YOU
TROUGH THAT BLACK HOLE
BUT WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER
IN THIS LIFE
SO I AM ENDING MINE
FOR US
CAUSE I'M OBSESSED
I AM POSSESSED!

I AM POSSESSED!
