IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP
AND GET MY FEET BACK ON THE GROUND

BUT I CAN FEEL MY HEART BURNING
AND MY MIND GOING BLANK
I'M TURNING INTO A HOLLOW SHELL
AND I TRY TO BLOCK IT OUT

YOU TRY TO SEND ME TO THE OTHER SIDE
BUT I'M ALREADY THERE

WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WILL RIP YOUR INSIDES OUT
AND TAKE YOU APART

I AM WELCOMING YOU AND YOUR WRATH
AND THE PAIN IS PIERCING MY FLESH
BLOOD FILLS MY MOUTH
BUT I SMILE

YOU ARE WEAK
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES
YOU WILL BEG FOR YOUR SOUL
AS I TAKE CONTROL
FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
I WANT YOU TO TRY
IT JUST TAKES ME TO A GREATER HIGH

WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WILL RIP YOUR INSIDES OUT
AND TAKE YOU APART

WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WILL RIP YOUR INSIDES OUT
AND TAKE YOU APART

NOW IT'S OVER
I WILL SEND YOU TO YOUR GRAVE
YOU WILL FALL INTO NOTHINGNESS
AND FOREVER BE OUR SLAVE

YOUR SWAN SONG CUTS THROUGH THE NIGHT
AND LEADS MY SOUL CLOSER
CLOSER TO ETERNAL LIFE
