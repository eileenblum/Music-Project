I gave you my heart
And you took it with greed
I gave you everything
But you couldn't do the same for me
My heart my soul my money my time
None of it was good enough for you
Now it's time to cut you loose

Never again
Will I be so blind
Never again
Will I give so much
My life will be mine
You're just a stepping stone
I had to climb

But I have to thank you
For showing me the truth
For all my wasted time
And all my wasted tears
I can finally see through all my fears
You were nothing but a hindrance
And I will be fine without
YOU

Never again
Will I be so blind
Never again
Will I give so much
My life will be mine
You're just a stepping stone
I had to climb

I will never be the same again
I may never love this way again

Your betrayal was steep
Your lies cut deep

But in the end you were nothing more than a nightmare

Never again
Will I be so blind
Never again
Will I give so much
My life will be mine
You're just a stepping stone
I had to climb

Never again
Never again
Never again!
