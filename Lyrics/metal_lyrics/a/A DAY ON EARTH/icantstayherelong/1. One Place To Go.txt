I tend to disagree
With the ones who proclaim
Our faith, skin-deep
And we are going down
"Hell! Hell! Hell! It's a brutal end!"
"Those who sin suffer after it all
They will feel a burning descent
Unless they repent"

Our sins have
Convinced them all
Fill us with fear

If the fire was a lie within the truth
Darkness, not what we knew
If we only had one place to go
What would change, I want to know!

These things are too much
For the saints, self-declared, had to lie
To show the sinners their fate
And keep us in our place
"Hell hell hell, it's a way to win"
Keeping the peace so selfishly and
Laughing away, we rot within,
Our fear so damaging

Our sins have
Convinced them all
Fill us with fear

If the fire was a lie within the truth
Darkness, not what we knew
If we only had one place to go
What would change, I want to know!

With no hell to find
Will we stay our paths or lose our minds?
Though there's no pain
Will our motivation be the same?
Nothing has to change!

(Dark replaced by the glow
Radiant from flames below )

You say it's tough love
Tear us down to elevate your own
Seeking out to judge
But broken are we all
Live your life, give it up to save yourself
The fire you see beneath your feet
Blinds you to
The possibilities

It's the end
The dark calls us
A welcoming grave

If the fire was a lie within the truth
Darkness, not what we knew
If we only had one place to go
What would change, I want to know!

I want to know
