Peace
It once existed
Near a star
Where none were fearful
Far
So far away now
I watch the stars
Hoping to shine among them

Take me away
Take me away
Take me far from here

Just one more time
Take me high
Higher in the sky
Just one more time
Refresh my mind
And take me closer to the star

Fear
It resides here
It's in our souls
It shows us who we are
Choose
To stay your path
Fall to the few
Or rise above them all

I can't stay here long
Take me away
Just take me away

Just one more time
Take me high
Higher in the sky
Just one more time
Refresh my mind
And take me closer to the star

I want to feel alive
Take me
Take me higher
I want to see the stars
Take me
Take me higher

Love
It's far above us
But we're still here
In this hell we were sent to
At last
My time has past
Fear twist our minds
Leaves us forever wanting

To get away
Take me away
Take me to the sky

Just one more time
Take me high
Higher in the sky
Just one more time
Refresh my mind
And take me closer to the star

Closer to the star
