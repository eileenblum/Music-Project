Come save me
Let me free
Hold me down
Take my crown.

Let life go, it's far too long.
Feel it glow, and find your call.
Let it go, move right along.
Move with the flow, don't trip and fall.

You're not alone
Get off your throne
Take your pride
Just put it inside

Let life go, it's far too long.
Feel it glow, and find your call.
Let it go, move right along.
Move with the flow, don't trip and fall.

Here I stand!
Take my broken hand!
Here I stand!
Evils not your friend!

Let life go, it's far too long.
Feel it glow, and find your call.
Let it go, move right along.
Move with the flow, don't trip and fall.(stand tall)
