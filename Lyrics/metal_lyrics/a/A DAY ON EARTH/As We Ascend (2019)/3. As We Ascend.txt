We won't give up yet
You better show some respect
This dream I've kept inside
Will not be hindered by you

We will fight 'til our last breath
With all of the strength that we have left
Don't you count us out yet
You will regret it in the end
As we ascend!

We won't waste our shot
This dream is all we've got
Your pathetic words
Mean nothing to me

We will fight 'til our last breath
With all of the strength that we have left
Don't you count us out yet
You will regret it in the end

We will make it through
I will promise you
One day you will see
Your word means nothing
We will make it through
I will promise you
One day you will see
Your word means nothing

Don't stand in our way bitch, you won't last a day!
Watch what you say you'll regret it someday
Watch what you say
Regret it someday

We will fight 'til our last breath
With all of the strength that we have left
Don't you count us out yet
You will regret it in the end
As we ascend!
