Always reminded
Of what could be
But never forgetting
What was said to me
This life is hard enough
Without our help
Let's shape this prophecy
It will write itself

I am running
I am running out of time!
Chasing this dream
I know it's meant to be!

I cannot see
Nor can I breathe without this
Right from the start
I'd give my beating heart
Everything we've done, we've done for you
Closing in on our destination
I can't believe how far we've come

Reflecting on the past
Will get you nowhere fast
Remain humble, you will see
Everything you want to be

I will not let you hinder me
This path we're on is so clear to see
Watch us close, you are sure to see
The answers are right in front of me

I am running
I am running out of time!
Chasing this dream
I know it's meant to be!
I am running
I am running out of time!
Chasing this dream
I know it's meant to be!
