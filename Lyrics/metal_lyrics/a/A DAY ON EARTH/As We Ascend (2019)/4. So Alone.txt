I have always felt so alone
And every day that feeling grows
It's getting hard to leave my home
I never know which way to go

Have you ever felt like me
Like you are so empty
Put your hands up high and sing with me
This world is fucking lousy
Have you ever felt like me
Like you are so empty
Put your hands up high and sing with me

It feels like I'm getting close
Closer to the end of the rope
If I keep it up I just might know
Where it is that we all go

Have you ever felt like me
Like you are so empty
Put your hands up high and sing with me
This world is fucking lousy
Have you ever felt like me
Like you are so empty
Put your hands up high and sing with me
This world is fucking lousy!

Don't you let this own you
You can make it through too
Follow me it's hard to see
But at least the path's not empty
Don't you let this own you
You can make it through too
Follow me it's hard to see
But at least the path's not empty
But at least the path's not empty!

Have you ever felt like me
Like you are so empty
Put your hands up high and sing with me
This world is fucking lousy
Have you ever felt like me
Like you are so empty
Put your hands up high and sing with me
This world is fucking lousy!
