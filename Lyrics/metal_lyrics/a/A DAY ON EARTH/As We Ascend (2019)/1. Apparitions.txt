Run!

I fear for my life
These haunting sounds they deafen me
I may lose my mind tonight
This feels like a dream
But these dreams aren't pleasing
I say goodbye
As the undead stare me in the eye

From these trees comes a deathly moan
Am I all alone?
The curse of these woods is unknown
Will I ever find my home?

I can see no light
I'm running blindly through the trees
I won't make it out alive
There I see those beings
I feel them glaring
I see their eyes
They're growing closer all the time

From these trees comes a deathly moan
Am I all alone?
The curse of these woods is unknown
Will I ever find my home?

I must find my way out of this place!
I must find my way out of this place!

One last breath!
One last breath!
Set me free!
Set me free!

From these trees comes a deathly moan
Am I all alone?
The curse of these woods is unknown
Will I ever find my home?

Find my home!
Find my home!
