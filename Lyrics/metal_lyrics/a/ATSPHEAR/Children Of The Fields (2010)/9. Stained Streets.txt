Can you see the rolling dice with your number facing back? 
Can you see the roulette wheel? 
It's not going to be black. 

The aces fly, never reaching your hand. 
You try and try. Always wait for that card. 
The chips are running out, out of stock. 
The joker's laughing from the bottom of the dock. 

You're loosing your money. 
Your life's no worth a penny. 
You're drunk. Forgotten. 
Your wallet's always empty. 

Now the streets are stained by your tears 
and your laughs, 
that will be erased whith tires and smoke. 
Nobody will suspect what happened tonite. 
A young wasted without leaving a sign. 

Back to board, throw the dice. 
Now you're sure. It is a five. 
Chance is controlling your life. 
Failed again. It's a two. 
You will never learn to choose. 
You'll never learn how to lose.
