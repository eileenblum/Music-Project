Pay attention to the words. Listen closer. 
This is what you're waiting for. Hear me talking. 

Whispers louder. Words upcoming. 
Learning process. Improvement of the will. 

Burn the flame of your intention! 

The way I feel won't let me think 
about the things to leave behind. 
Which one to take? Which one to waste, my friend? 

Drain that sickness from your head. Wake up sleeper! 
Surely one day you will rest, but not yet. 

Watch how your time sinks in quicksand. 
Fight to rise up from this swamp you call life.
