I can't stand the horror, I can't stand the hate. 
But I'll wait for tomorrow... Hope it won't be too late. 
I must just be patient, I must just relax, 
cause they say I'm mistaken. 
God knows I wish I was! 

It's like tunnel vision. I can't look away. 
Turns it to obsession. I can't remove it from my head. 

Liberate my madness! Liberate my mind! 

Why should I suppress my feelings if everybody thinks I'm right? 
Why should I suppress my feelings? 
Cause everybody knows I'm wrong.
