As I close the gates of trauma 
I get caught by shades of regret. 
Bleeding eyes stare from the inside 
at mirrors that reflect the distress. 
Watch me vigilant! 

And I can't even hide. No matter what I try. 

Take my hand. 
Rescue me from the madness i'm in too deep. 
Save my soul. Feed my will. 
Give me one good reason to live. 

As I try to fix the faulty, 
I, myself, become my nemesis. 
Memories are cruel disciples 
of relapse when I'm awakening. 
Watch me vigilant! 

You can't read your book when you reject your own past; 
when you reject to be the main character. 
You must die. 
You must see you dying to know that you're still alive.
