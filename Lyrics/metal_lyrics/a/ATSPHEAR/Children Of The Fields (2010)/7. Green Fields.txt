Green fields, another day comes. 
Here it comes another day... 

Open your eyes and get blind by the sunrise. 
Open your arms to the day. 

Children of the Sun awake! 

Ride on a leaf. Surf the sky to the sunset. 
Open your arms to the night. 

Children of the Moon awake! 

Children of the Sun... Children of the Moon... 

And when the children of the Sun joined their hands to the children of the Moon, sowed the seeds of the green fields. 
And when the children of the Moon joined their hearts to the children of the Sun, sowed the seeds of the green fields. 

Children of the Sun awake! 
Children of the Moon awake! 
Children of the fields awake!
