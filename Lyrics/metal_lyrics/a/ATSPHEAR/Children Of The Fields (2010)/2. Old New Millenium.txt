Breathing the scent of a past better air. 
(We're sowing the seeds). 
Die by the edge of the tonge of your partners. 
(To harvest the grief). 
Encourage the beast! 

Holding the detonator with a weak hand. 
(We're making our bet). 
Choose any card. Will be hard when we see it. 
(Death in disguise). 

Psychosomatic crisis, mistrust, accept the menace. 
Believe the voice that's telling you yo fear the others. 
Spirit paranoia, dawn of a world size fear. 
A heart attack, a lack of hope, a reign of tears. 

Welcome to the new old millenium. 
Take part of the new world hysteria. 
Old new millenium.
