I've gone through this judgement once 
and I claimed for my innocence. 
My own mistakes walk by my side. 

I've gone through this judgement twice 
and I was found guilty. 
Forgiveness walks one step ahead. 

'Cause there's no hope in this oblivion. 
I am the prosecutor and I am the executioner. 

Bring myself to the eye of the storm where a part of me is holding the keystone. 

I save myself, I trap myself, I hurt myself, I heal myself.
