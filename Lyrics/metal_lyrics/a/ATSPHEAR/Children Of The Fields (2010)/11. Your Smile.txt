Imagine that your make up flakes, 
so everyone could see your face's a fake. 
Imagine that your skin decays, 
but you have to pretend that it's ok. 

And everyone would know you're not being sincere. 
While they enjoy the show your smile cannot appear. 

Now everyday your brightness fades, 
so nobody can see you cry and help. 
You keep on shining. 
They feel sympathy, but don't stop to ask. 
Cause all of this time you've being wearing a mask. 

They feel that they've been fooled. 
That trusting was in vain. 
They say today's the day for you to stand the pain.
