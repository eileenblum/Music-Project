I'm buried now in a desert. 
Im' buried now alive. 

Althought everything is quiet on the surface, 
there are snakes down underground. 
Althought everything is alright by your side, 
there are shadows in my soul. 
There are shadows in my soul that noone can see. 

Althought you have thought about it many times, 
it is not enough for me. 
I've been eating sand, i've been drinking sweat, 
there is no life in here. no chance to forget. 
I've been wasting time, I've been gaining pain. 
There is no air here. No way to strain. 

There are shadows in my soul that noone can see. 
You can take everything from me. It doesn't matter now. 
You can leave me here in my grave. 
I will escape, but I don't know how.
