Blood is the sign of life. But now he bleeds nomore. 
Flesh is the worthless shell for an inmortal soul. 
Finds out he was betrayed and claims out for revenge. 
A tireless will to chase the killers of his dreams. 

And then returns to where she lies; 
to where her body awaits in death. 
What would she think? 
Is this ok? 
All that I own, I would give it to her. 

Cold was the quiet blade that took her life away. 
Sweet was the poison's taste that turned his veins of grey. 
He lies in wait for them to make up with his pride. 
The flame of evil burns when he stares at her eyes. 
And fall to pieces... 

Give me back what is mine, 
Give me back all this time, 
Give me back all this wrath. 
Lead me back to my path.
