Itâs a matter of time that you realize whatâs hiding behind those wicked lies. 
As a matter of fact youâre not alone, despite all the things that youâve been told. 

Iâve been searching for you, so you find out the truth, 
Youâve been wondering âbout all these memories. 

Do you think they were dreams? They are part of your life: We were made of the same material. 
It will clash with your faith, but donât be afraid. Empire of truth will prevail. 

There was the age chaos 
When fire melted us down. 
Together weâre stronger, 
They donât want you to know. 

They keep you weak with half a heart. 
Their strongest shield: your ignorance. 
I am the light you need to see, 
Open your eyes and come to me. 

I see nowâ¦ 

I am the one I used to be, 
My heart emits a single beat. 

I receive my commitment to the laws of nature as the entity I am. 
I have no longer memory, and my mind is made up the foundations of the balance. 
Now my acts are relevant and they write the history, so there could be a future.
