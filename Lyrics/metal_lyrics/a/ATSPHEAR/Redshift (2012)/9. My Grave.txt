â...All right, connection successful. Itâs great to hear from a human being again. Well, up here everything is different than we thought. I can hardly find the words to describe this vision. Itâs like... well, I canât explain it. Itâs like weâve been wrong all this time. All that we learned... forget it. It seems like physics are not the same here. Itâs difficult to understand, but I hope I can show you. Let me adjust some settings and Iâll be ready for transmission. OK, emitter OK, image OK and... What the...? What was that? Iâll try to fix that. Itâs like some... Damn it! Can you hear me? Hello? HELLO?!â 

Iâve been left here on my own. 
I canât take it all alone. 
They made me feel as if I was the one, 
But years went by and all went wrong. 

Now Iâm living in a hole. 
Itâs that time just takes its toll. 
My body aches and I feel old, 
and I canât find the way back home. 

Damn my mission, damn my fate. 
Iâve been cursed by my mistakes. 
These mistakes could have been fixed, 
but, well... I guess now itâs too late. 

I could make this end today. 
I could face death and be brave. 
But I donât want to end this way 
âcause thereâs no land to dig my grave.
