Itâs time to leave and vanish, itâs time to disappear. 
Iâm gonna join the past. 

I want to be remembered, but memories are weak. 
Flesh always turn to dust. 

Help me, I lose control 

The darkness grows around me, 
it feels like itâs the end. 
It feels like itâs too fast. 

I canât believe Iâm dying, 
It doesnât hurt at all. 
Itâs just a kind of trance. 

I see that dying man, 
I recognize his face: 
The face that I once had 
seems horrible to me. 

Iâve got no limits now, 
Iâm energy in space. 

My body is underground, 
It gives me real strength. 

I see those dying men, 
I just feel sympathy. 

Death brings a new life. 

Iâm bigger than before, 
And Iâve ripped the yoke of flesh. 
What was my driving force 
is an absolute nonsense. 

Iâm the builder of the stage.
