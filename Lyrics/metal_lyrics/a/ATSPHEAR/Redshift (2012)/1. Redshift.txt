Light travels on the shockwave
Against an everlasting force.
How long will it take to gravity
To win and throw us all into the black hole?

We receive radiation from the past,
memories of primeval energy.
We rely on itâ¦
Everything is quiet out there
while forces struggle.

Do we know? Do we want to know?
Do we know that weâre just stardust in the universe
and we could vanish without a trace?
We are completely weak and defenceless,
so we wait and pretend that
we donât know that weâre just stardust in the universe,
and nothing elseâ¦

We believe that the Earth is here to last,
but we refuse to face the facts:
It wasnât here beforeâ¦
Destruction leads to evolution,
Weâre just a step to a further stage construction.

Do we know?
Do we know that weâre just stardust in the universe,
and we could vanish without a trace?
We are completely weak and defenceless,
so we wait and pretend that
we donât know that weâre just stardust in the universe,
and nothing elseâ¦

Blue shift, gravity claims her tribute.
Big crunch, swallow the old dead stars.
Black hole, thereâs no final judgement day.
Hold on, it will begin once againâ¦
