Stars, left behind. 
All I see is a blast of energy. 
I still can feel on my skin the side effects of a quantum leap. 

I think, therefore I am. 
But I can hardly understand what's going on. 

Universe collapses. Another one is born. 
I dive into the black stone and cross the outer bounds. 
Cosmic strings become a gate to the unknown. 

All this things happen to be real, 
but at this point I cannot even feel. 

My skin... Freeze! 
My chest... Freeze! 
My lungs... Freeze! 
My heart... Freeze! 

Rise! Rise! My consciousness. 
Rise! Rise! My will. 
Rise! Rise! My wisdom. 
Rise! Rise to the next level! 

I reach a new state of matter. I really dominate the space and time. 
My human limits have been shattered. I share a common universal mind. 

I don't belong to anywhere. I'm but a flow of electricity. 
I don't belong to anywhere. I only care about infinity. 

What am I supposed to do? 

Universe collapses. Another one is born. 
I dive into the black stone and cross the outer bounds. 
Cosmic strings become a gate to the unknown.
