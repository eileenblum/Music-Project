Will I reach the roots of space and time? 
Will I ever find the answer? 
Why are we here? So long now... 

Centuries I have spent on my research, 
centuries I've devoted to 
our existence. 

When I reach my destination 
I'll have been forgotten long ago. 
A legend to generations, 
they soon gave me up for lost. 

Is this worth the wait? What is this for? 
Will I ever be successful? 
I don't think so... 

Everyone who knew me passed away, 
now my gift has turned into my curse. 
I feel useless... 

If I reach my destination 
I'll have been forgotten long ago. 
A legend to generations, 
they soon gave me up for lost. 

Now it seems so far, but the pressure growsâ¦ 
Moments of reliefâ¦ now it seems so close. 

All around is changing, thereâs a new hope in my head. 
All around is changing, destination right ahead. 
Just another vision, (â¦) 
Just another vision, destination far away. 
Now it seems so close, (â¦) 
Moments of reliefâ¦ now it seems so far.
