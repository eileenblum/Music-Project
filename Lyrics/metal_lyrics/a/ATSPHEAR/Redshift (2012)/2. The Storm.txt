The rain falls down, and blinds my vision 
I wonder why should I stand this. 

I beat the force of gravity 
and breathe the air of ancient times. 
I understand what are we made of 
and realize that life is precious. 

The sun rays keep my face enlightened, 
above the clouds, the storm is over. 

The weight of all the Universe 
is over me, I have to struggle. 
My freedom is my best reward, 
my spirit keeps my will unbroken. 

The sun rays keep my face enlightened, 
above the clouds, the storm is over.
