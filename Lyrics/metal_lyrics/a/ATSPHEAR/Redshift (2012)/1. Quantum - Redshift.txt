Redshift. Light travels on the shockwave 
against an everlasting force. 
How long will it take to gravity 
to win and throw us all into the black hole? 

We receive radiation from the past, 
memories of preimeval energy. 
We rely on it... 
Everything is quiet out there 
while forces struggle. 

Do we know? Do we want to know? 
Do we know that we're just stardust in the universe 
and we could vanish without a trace? 
We are completely weak and defenceless, 
so wait and pretend 
that we don't know that we're just stardust in the universe, 
and nothing else... 

We believe that the Earth is here to last, 
but we refuse to face the facts. 
It wasn't here before... 
Destruction leads to evolution. 
We're just a step to a further stage construction. 

Do we know? 
Do we know that we're just stardust in the universe 
and we could vanish without a trace? 
We are completely weak and defenceless, 
so wait and pretend 
that we don't know that we're just stardust in the universe, 
and nothing else... 

Blueshift. Gravity claims her tribute. 
Big Crunch, swallow the old dead stars. 
Black Hole. There's no final judgement day. 
Hold on. It will begin once again.
