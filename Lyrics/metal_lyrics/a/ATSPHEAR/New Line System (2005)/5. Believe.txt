Last day on Earth. The sky spits fire
Our time is over forever

Souls devoured. Eternal death
The judgement day is now

In my heart everything is a lie. That's the only truth
A dark flame burns my mind
Like the truth burns the lie

I won't believe in your lie

Holy bible and false devices
It doesn't makes sense. Accept it!

I deny you and your shady words
Forgotten promises forever

How deep is your faith?
It doesn't explains
I remember one time when everything was better

I will not come back. It haunts my dreams
We want to be free to believe in a different God
