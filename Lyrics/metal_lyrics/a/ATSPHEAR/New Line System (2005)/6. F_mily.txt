I've always belonged to the time. The new age
I am ready to go to live all my life
A new family search escapes from me

The feelings are forever
As I begin to carve my wishes
While I am looking for you
I don't care what's next

Anyway an empty place will take up the weak minds
Once again nothing can save my blurred emotions
