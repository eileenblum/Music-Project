A new world in front of us
It has just started
A future full up machines and inert
Vapors filling up the air. Gearing check by machines
A future full up deaths and agony

They are being watched over. They work for it's well-being
Atmosphere's slaved. Rarefied to toxicity
It's our future. We are condemned
Atmosphere X

There's no salvation. Everything is ruined
But the worst is about to arrive
We can't stand more pain. My sons starved to death
And I feel fear of my own reality

I can't understand this fucking reality
