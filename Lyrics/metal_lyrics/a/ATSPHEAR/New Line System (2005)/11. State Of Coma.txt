Deep, mysterious
Bring off your mind the experience
Alone
Given dreams all ridden with pain
Forsaken
Trying to find some peace of mind
Sleep
There's innocence for my reason

And my eyes are dead. I preserve the calm
Wearing the mask of a ghost
Mercy in my eyes

Now is time to dream
Waiting anxiety for a fair judgement

Let me taste
I'm still beneath in the soil
Alone
In this endless coma of souls
Silently
Ochre sands are blown by the wind
In this land where ravens cry their agony

Let me feel
I'm dying fast inside your tears
Alone
The silence of your embrace
Awhile
The mere reflection brought disgust
The end
Honouring the one engraved

This time you are beyond all help
In solid tears I linger
My shadow is born from a light
