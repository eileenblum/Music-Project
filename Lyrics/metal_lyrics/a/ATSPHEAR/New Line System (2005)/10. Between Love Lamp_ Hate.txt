On this words I spit, how I've dried the tears,
I'm not broken. I ain't the one that you think
Bad things all around now are deep inside
Now I see the colors between black and white

This is my new beginning and not my curtain falls
I'm not as weak as before
Your laughs make me love...

The pain you will feel
The spark you won't see
You'll be here while I'll be there
Then you'll suffer

This is just my revenge

Past the time I'm here swimming in my dreams
And you're broken, shank in your beliefs
Once you were my core, but that was before
I needed a virgin and you was a whore

This is your new beginning
This is your curtain's fall
You're now weaker than before
Your love just make me laugh

This is just my revenge
