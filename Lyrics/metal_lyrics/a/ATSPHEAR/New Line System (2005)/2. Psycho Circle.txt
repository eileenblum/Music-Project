Paranoia is the lie. It is the larve of my sick mind
There is nothing telling me,
So I will stand the infection of my brain

Trying to cleanse the infection
That is only fiction
Within myself to be what I am / what I became

For this time I lost my friends
I'm left alone within my mind
I want to keep the last remorse
Before you eliminate my life

Clarity is the end of a tunnel
A life out of control
Psycho circle, draw your shape on my face
This is my final beat
