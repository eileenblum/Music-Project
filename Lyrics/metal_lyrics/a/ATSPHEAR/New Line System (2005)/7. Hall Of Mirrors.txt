Taste my terror
Spiral of hate
So bloody in this world so rancid
There is no return from hall of mirrors

You hear my cry
It keeps me so alive
Every dream so forlorn
And there's no way out from hall of mirrors

I slay your hopes and dreams

I am undone
Something disappeared. So tragic
And I close my eyes slowly
Take my life away from hall of mirrors

I choose a dream
But you're killing me so furious
Everyday
So dying here i go again
In hall of mirrors
