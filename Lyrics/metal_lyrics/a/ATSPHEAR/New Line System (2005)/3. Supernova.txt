Coming, coming
One of the most explosives
The light. A blast wave that ejects
When it's nuclear fuel is exhausted,
Then it's core will collapse

Coming, coming
The charm of supernovae
The end of a massive star into nuclear energy
A chemical evolution

Where is the brightness?
Within the sky!
Supernovae
The zodiacal night
