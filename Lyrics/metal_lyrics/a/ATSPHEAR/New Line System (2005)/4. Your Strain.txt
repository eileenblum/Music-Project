Moans because demise of a beloved
His life has been shattered
Victim of her worry

And you're thinking that did the better
Die, die!
His shame was your proud
Your eyes shed awful scarlet tears
What did you listen inside of you?

You used my heart and shut my mouth
I never felt your gaze
Thought you loved me

Hear this words of relief coming out like the rain
It's my last goodbye
