Beyond my space
From my insanity
Embody the light. In a quiet place for them lives

Over a black hole shine electric stars
It's real
A sign of future

Electric spine
The mystery of time
Tonight you'll find the new light

You live in a dream world
Don't lie to yourself
You know you were lost in your dreams
Sentry of your fears

It's uncertain path to go into your mind
So introverted to cross the line towards the stars

If I fail my question and I find my answer
Now is the time to electrostatic nation

Build your own illusion
Leave your mind everyday
You'll find peace in electrostatic nation
