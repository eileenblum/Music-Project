Dwelling in these mortal lands
Ancients forests that speak to me
Seek now the sanctuary
Of our infinite dark empire
I emerge from the fog
Beneath the moonlit skies
Sitting upon my oaken throne
My spirit is one with this forest

A palace shrouded in emptiness
Lies beyond the endless vast horizon
Surrounded by the souls of the living
Their haunted voices they repulse me

My journey leads me to their lands
Forsaken by their dark emperor
They abhor this dying forest
They battle against their immortal souls
This kingdom of decaying darkness
No traces of life to be found
This land of infernal blackness
Speaks words of hate into my soul

I arrive at the gates
Enshrined in an everlasting haze

Filled with sorrow and despair
A woeful man returning
To my vast domain
My primal and arcane land
Leaving the palace behind

Returning to the tranquil forest
My soul is now at peace
My warm breath on this midnight fog
Veils this land
With a cryptic harmony

The sound of the streams in the distance
The wind rushing through the leaves

The scent of the forest, the trees and fog
A pale reflection of an ominous moon
The ageless winds of this eternal night
They leave my soul at peace
