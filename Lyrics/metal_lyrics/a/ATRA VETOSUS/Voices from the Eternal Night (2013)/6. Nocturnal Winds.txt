I awake in this place of unholy dismay
My body is lifeless, this pain and despair
Memories from a past age, possessing my visions
Consuming me in a dark cold wretchedness
An undying flame of everlasting darkness
Concealed within the depths of my despised essence
Forever bound this fortress of dismal hate

A blackened moon, a welkin darkness
This winter reeks of death
These cold nocturnal winds bring awakening
This dark winterly nightfall brings a misery upon this land
The howling of a lone night wolf the flame within my soul
Feeling the frosty breeze of a never ending era
Above my bitter empire of this earthly realm

This hollow bleak night sky
A blackened sphere of death and emptiness
The starless heavens, a barren void
That will never be filled

This barren domain, forever to be forgotten
The icy field under my bare feet
Shivering under bitter conditions
The sheltering shadow that covers this world
The freezing death that engulfs this land
Has put us under a spell of coldness

This eternal night these darkened lands of hate-filled misery
Leaving me trapped in an orb of pain and suffering
Now drowning in the sorrowful abyss of my depleted soul
This eternal wintry night, an everlasting illusion in my mind
