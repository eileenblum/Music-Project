The darkness fills this empty place
The dim light of the stars peeks
Through the branches of dying trees
A light mist fills the dark cold air this night

A burden of coldness
Sucked into my dying lungs
And my final breaths
Are turning into fog
As I release the trapped air
From primordial ages

The sound of my footsteps
Awakens distant beats
As past autumns leaves
Crush under my feet
These beasts are disturbed
By my presence
Their time of feasting is near

The wide eyes of an infernal night owl
Watching my every dismal step
My every dying breath
As he is surrounded by the solitude
Of dying trees
I hear the breath of a majestic wolf

My flesh will renew his dying strength
And now my walk of solitude
In these dying lands draws to its demise
I reach out for my final breath

Darkness surrounds me
And fills me with emptiness
Drowning in eternal blackness
My life sucked out of my body

And now as the rain forces my lifeless
Blood into the time - Worn path
The beasts of this land feast
And my sorrowful burden bleeds
Out of my lonely soul

And I pass into another realm
And infinite blackness fills me
I pass my spirit into the forgotten woods
