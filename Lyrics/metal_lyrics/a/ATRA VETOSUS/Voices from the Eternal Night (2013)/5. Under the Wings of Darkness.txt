Hallowed now in the sky, the dim light of the moon
As the wings of darkness stretch across the clouds

As we draw near to the ancient kingdoms
Our shadows slowly stretch out
Reaching for the horizon the sun now turns its back on us
A door is standing open before me as I arrive at this sacred place
I feel the infernal darkness that will soon consume my soul

The power of the ancients has been placed in my hands
Called to conquer, what lies before me
I leave this kingdom of ancient glory
Under the cloak of darkness I ride
Across the plains, to the land of immortals

As the black flame of the oppressors burns in hatred
The spirit of the woodlands is with me in my hour of darkness

Flayed by the words spoken by the dark lord
Oppressed by the people who summon the blackest power
The dark forces of the spiritual realms oppose me
Their hatred kindles the greates flame
That will burn against me eternally

Eyes of infernal doom
Calling anger deeper than sin
A tainted victory
Shall haunt us a cold silent memory

As the eastern realms are conquered
A battle of astral forces
Has left now, this place, a cold forgotten memory
