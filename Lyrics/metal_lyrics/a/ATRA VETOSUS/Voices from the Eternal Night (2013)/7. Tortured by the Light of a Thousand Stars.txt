Beneath the sky, painted with a thousand stars
An untouched land of arcane beauty
The crystal lake basking in such glorious light
Far in the distance now lies the ancient castle

This kingdom of nature hidden within the forgotten woods
Surrounded by the sheltering fortress of these mighty aging trees

The cryptic darkness surrounding the great lake
Stretches out to the surrounding woodlands
The peace within these forbidden lands
Disturbed by only the light from above

Where a shadow would rest beneath such oaken glory
There lies the tears of the forest
The leaves fallen as the cold death of winter approaches

Echoing now, the valley, woodland songs, hailing from the north
Chants flowing with the sound of the streams
A voice made one with the whispers of the forest

Whatever walks in these lands
Will walk with the spirit of the forgotten woods

And the darkness that shelters the distant kingdoms
Shall now haunt this place of immortality
And like the falling shadows of the night
The woodlands shall forget now all life

This place forever remains
Frozen in time, beneath the stars
The sentinels of the heavens
Forever looking upon these sacred lands
