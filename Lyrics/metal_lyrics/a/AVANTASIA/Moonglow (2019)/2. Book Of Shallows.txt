What if I would script a dream?
And if I'd let you in?
I'd be your door out of a stark truth...

Leave a stark reality
An arrant giveness
I'd make you fall to be there for you

Let Morpheus commit his spark
To a stray soul wandering
Errant in the dark

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake
Chase your dream!
When all comes breaking down around it
What a day for a pastel dream
That's coming to life...

Beautiful in colour
United in their creed
Reasonable people dreaming ordinary dreams

Rise above confusion
And leverage the weak
Dive into the shuffle
And then tap into the freak show

And Morpheus commits his spark
To a plain soul wandering, errant in the dark

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake
Chase your dream!
When all comes breaking down around it
What a day for a pastel dream
That's coming to life...

May it charm the living
May it ease misgiving
Intoxicating, dazing
Rapture of the shallow
Dazed and captured

Say you wanna be now
Sneak into their dream now
Suck up to their love
You're the master of their freakshow
Give into temptation
Seek and bring salvation
Mine now, Suburbia!
Tomorrow it's the nation

Wait for a savior
Rising from the tranquil sea
The book of shallows
Bringing forth a common dream

Going with the grain
Numb the pain
We are common sense
Knock them down a peg
Make them beg for deliverance
Rapture of the deep, they believe
Take a deep bow
Give them what they need now
Mingle with the creep show

Going with the grain
Numb the pain
We are common sense

Give them what they need now
Mingle with the creep show

Rising from the tranquil sea
The book of shallows
Bringing forth a common dream

Let Morpheus commit his spark
To a stray soul wandering in the dark

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake

Chase your dream
When all comes breaking down around it
What a day for a pastel dream
That's goin' to plan

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake

What a day for a pastel dream
That's goin' to plan
What a day for a pastel dream
That's goin' to plan
