Don't we all keep moving on
As we all try to spell forevermore
I have been searching, where I was told
Didn't find myself around the bend

Oh I tried to run forever in a lonely charade

Back on my way, hot on the trail again
Afraid of moving closer to my heart
I would always do anything
Always tried to believe I can
I was burning down inside to play my part

Are we meant to feel ok as we stray in someone else's dream?
Burning with honour and pride - for glory and fame

Oh I tried to run forever in a lonely charade

Back on my way, hot on the trail again
Afraid of moving closer to my heart
I would always do anything
Always tried to believe I can
I was burning down inside to play my part

Back on my way, hot on the trail again
Afraid of moving closer to my heart
