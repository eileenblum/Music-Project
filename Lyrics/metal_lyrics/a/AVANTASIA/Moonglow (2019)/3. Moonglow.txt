Such a beautiful light to undo what I thought I believed in
Wild and cold is the wind thatâll blow my conviction away

Hear the call of the bright moon above
Outside of your window
Would you follow me into a world
Where reason doesnât pertain

Everything Iâve come to know is gonna fall to pieces
Everything youâve come to dream is gonna turn out real

A lunar light into your room
Let it carry you into the night
Moonglow ~ let it take you away

The road aflame ~ fooling gravity ~ you follow the light
Moonglow, Moonglow to the other side

All youâre told to comprehend
And put in place and understand
Is gone in the enchanting magic light

Follow me into the night to a place by the willow
Leave all your schemes and patterns of thinking behind
And I dream how I rise
As I look down on the shelf on a pillow
And I know I wonât try to explain
What Iâve seen in this night

Everything youâve come to know is gonna fall to pieces
Everything Iâve come to dream is gonna turn out real

A lunar lightâ¦
A lunar flight into your room
Let it carry you into the night
Moonglow ~ let it take you away

The road aflame ~ fooling gravity ~ you follow the light
Moonglow, Moonglow ~ to the other side

Oh ~ Will you take me over
Take me over
World in the moonglow

Make me feel
This is real
A face in the moonglow

A lunar light into your room
Let it carry you into the night
Moonglow ~ let it take you away

The road aflame ~ fooling gravity ~ you follow the light
Moonglow, Moonglow ~ to the other side
All youâre told to comprehend
And put in place and understand is gone
