[originally by Michael Sembello]Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life in the real time world
No one sees her at all they all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at the show,
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery, touch it but can't hold it
You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by it's a push shove world
But there's always a chance if the hunger stays the night

There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
