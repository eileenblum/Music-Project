They were taking small pains
To not make him realize
Made him feel he's different
Through and through

A monster in his own way
Communicative quarantine
Unleashed on the world without a clue

Surrounded by the ghosts of paling pictures
They come and slip away

Vivid memories roll and spin
If only they would suck me in

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

Breathing odour of lavender
And it's all coming back to me
Wish I didn't fail to say those
Words before you'd have to leave

A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves

Here I stand and survey
What the Father's cast my way
A wind got up to bode times of change

I close the door behind me
Know the day break is too far

Me and who I was:
Alone, estranged

Surrounded by the scent invoking pictures
Gone and yet so clear

Vivid memories roll and spin
If only they would suck me in

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

Breathing odour of lavender
And it's all coming back to me
Wish I didn't have to see now
What back then I didn't see

A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves

The crazy part ain't dreaming, wishing on a falling star
It's the world that's in between the cope and you
I close my eyes and see a magic world in sepia
That cast me out onto a road without a clue

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

Breathing odour of lavender
And it's all coming back to me
Wish I didn't fail to say those
Words before you'd have to leave

A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves
A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves
A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves
