[Hansi KÃ¼rsch:]
Wild groves, sacred grounds fade to vastness
Mother Moon, cast your spell on these fields
Let the boughs paint ghostly shades on the trail
To a different world

[Tobias Sammet:]
Where castle looks out to a valley
Where I'm given all the love that I crave
Not afraid of the rising sun laying bare my brittle soul

[Hansi KÃ¼rsch:]
Cold is the wind
Bringing forth clarity
Time rushing on
And nothing will remain
There's no glory on the last journey home...

[Tobias Sammet:]
Looking down from this pure cope of heaven
Onto an ocean of white that drowns
All the noise and decree
And the craze in empty eyes

Wide-eyed I'm lost in my imagination:
A dream of love
I've got to suffocate while I keep on waiting
For the hour I'll be called to realize
And see it all before my eyes

The sky is crawling down the mound
Into the deadwood on the ground
They say

[Hansi KÃ¼rsch:]
Spectres flare and spit and rise
To mingle with the skies
And take all that's never meant to be

[Tobias Sammet:]
A fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way
Gonna run and never get away
Is it love that glows in fiery alignment?
Starry-eyed? Maybe living a lie?
[Hansi KÃ¼rsch:]
A lonely heart in and endless line

[Tobias Sammet:]
Oh raven child
Raven child

[Jorn Lande:]
Bewildering and strange
The scent of spring and cherry blossoms
Sweet scent of rain
They're calling you
Astounding how it is
Not the same it used to be
When you're compelled behind
The crenel on your own

The tolling of the bell, is there
Anyone to tell me what they wanna say

[Tobias Sammet:]
Voices go on and on and on to me
But their tongues won't permeate
Throughout my soul

[Jorn Lande:]
In your altered state of mind
In vain you're chasing light
Your master in his frown
Denial of the crown of creation
You're mad to think you are

[Tobias Sammet:]
A fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way
Gonna run and never get away
Is it love that glows in fiery alignment?

A fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way
Gonna run and never get away
Is it love that glows in fiery alignment?
Starry-eyed? Maybe living a lie?
A lonely heart in and endless line

[Jorn Lande:]
Light breeze in the crowns of the willows
Green fields as if the day was on the wane
Grow faint and attain to perfection
What a backdrop for a diamond

[Tobias Sammet:]
And so we sway in the wind like the willow
Meant to give way to the order of the storm
Won't leave a mould in the marsh of the ages
A tired chevalier of fortune

[Hansi KÃ¼rsch:]
Blue and serene once a sky swanned on magic
The unborn in the stream of destiny
Time flows to become a mound of nothing
For a broken soldier of fortune

[Tobias Sammet:]
On my...

[Chanting:]
Comin' down
Goin' all the way now
You won't get away
You know
Finally the way you're shown
You're goin' now

[Jorn Lande:]
Into the light

[Tobias Sammet:]
In the light there's a crack torn open
From underneath the day
In the light, but a crack, is it growing?
Feel the dark rolling in, your way
Feel the light look away
It's gonna blind you
Ignite you spirits fly

[Jorn Lande:]
See a light to uncloak their master
To arouse the beaten mind

[Tobias Sammet:]
In the light there's a crack torn open
From underneath the day

[Jorn Lande:]
You dream and fly

[Tobias Sammet:]
In the light, but a crack, is it growing?
Feel the dark rolling in your way

[Jorn Lande:]
Hey raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Feel the light look away
It's gonna blind you
Ignite you spirits fly

[Jorn Lande:]
Uncloak the raven master
To arouse the beaten mind

You tuck away yourself inside
You ride away on the inmost light
Your soul glowing opal-blue

[Tobias Sammet:]
A million voices fade away
I never really got what they're trying to say
For my words there's no getting through

[Jorn Lande:]
Oh, you sail to the night's plutonian shore
You drift to sleep
You can't take no more of this
And like a raven child
You spread your paltry wings and throw
Yourself into the wind to escape from all below
That despised the raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Am I awake or is it an evil dream
Or maybe the ugly in between
Like me... a weak hermaphrodite

[Jorn Lande:]
A burning soul in unimpaired parts
In quest for light but it was the dark
That embraced the raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
A cloak of invisibility to curtain
The fate of deformity, no...
Darkness let me in

[Jorn Lande:]
Off to the night's plutonian shores
You dream and hope you won't wake no more to this!
Flying raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Oh fiery eyes

[Jorn Lande:]
Flying raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Oh fiery eyes

[Jorn Lande:]
Oh to escape from all below
Spread your wings... and go
Like a raven child
