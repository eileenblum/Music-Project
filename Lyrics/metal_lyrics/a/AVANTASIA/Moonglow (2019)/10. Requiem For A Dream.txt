What do you see?
Is it your own reflection that's staring at you?
An out-of-body perception?
Or some kind of stranger that laughs at a fool?

Is it the world that has changed?
Or is it you at the sound of the knell?
And how did they fail to prepare you
For all that awaits once you're out of your shell?

Oh oh
Feel the cold breeze in your face
Walk on, one way
End of days

Time to face what it's all about
May the waves take you in

A long way from home
You're out on your own
To crave all alone and alone you'll realize
What life turns out to be...

Future ain't what it used to be
When all givens they fall into abeyance
Fall into abeyance

Let it all wash over me
Requiem for a dream

How long have we stayed in concealment
Chilled to the marrow, crept stealthily?
Celestial lights satiating the dark
Of deplorable reality

Every breath towards what shone with a lustre
Horizons that sentineled dreams
Now doesn't it even seem crazy
To be aghast at what things will not be

Oh oh
See the rainbow slowly fade
Walk on, one way
End of days...

Time to face what it's all about
May the waves take you in

A long way from home
You're out on your own
To crave all alone and alone you'll realize
What life turns out to be...

Future ain't what it used to be
Fall into abeyance
Fall into abeyance

Let it all wash over me
Requiem for a dream

There's someone by your side
Four steps behind
Makes sure you keep the pace
And love the grind

Time to face what it's all about
May the waves take you in
A long way from home
You're out on your own
To crave all alone and alone you'll realize
Future ain't what it used to be
And all givens they fall into abeyance
Fall into abeyance

Let it all wash over me
Requiem for a dream
