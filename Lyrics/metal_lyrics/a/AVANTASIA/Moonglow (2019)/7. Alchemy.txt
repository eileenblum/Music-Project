The writing's on the wall
Will you go on and fool yourself?
In no time youâll be done

Refusing to adjust yourself to the flow
Why walk the stoney road?
You won't get out alive

Nobody understands it, do you?
Come in and look around:
Every single stroke, they say
Was worth the pain
Now, in this gallery of wonder
You wonder what it's all about
Well, selling sun in the rain!

Weâre gonna give them bite-sized harmony
Oh, we're gonna shove it down their throats

Dreams and fire - we are alchemy
You set out on the losing end
Gonna make you whole again
Waste to diamonds - we are alchemy
No one to be left in need
We're gilding their reality

We gotta keep 'em dancing
While tears pour out of blackened skies
Another shade of drama

Spectators weeping over cries
That broken heroes
Drag from crazy minds
And by the way, now:

They who pay the piper call the tune at last
Knowing what you wanna give
And what is gonna do
Feeding on desire
The spectres shall arise
Right in front of their eyes

We're gonna give them perfect harmony
Oh, we're gonna shove it down their throats

Dreams and fire - we are alchemy
You set out on the losing end
Gonna make you whole again

Waste to diamonds - we are alchemy
No one to be left in need
We're gilding their reality

We'd never lie
Weâre never ever gonna let you down

When danger and distraction lie in wait
Weâd never lie
When dreams aspire to take you down
We' never dare to lie to you
Youâre just spared the part of truth
That doesn't make any sense to you...

Dreams and fire - we are alchemy
You set out on the losing end
Gonna make you whole again
Waste to diamonds - we are alchemy

No one's to be left in need
A new take on reality
