Hold on tight
You don't let go
Bygone days bound to corrode
Sentimental, poignant
Shady recollections slowly fade away
Beckon to nothing

All had begun just with a dream
Watered down
Sometimes you failed to feel
Pushed around, youâre losing ground
The sands of time they taint the instant
A stifled fire

You fade to nothing
Will you fell like you don't belong
Or will you cease to feel at all

Throw yourself into the waves
Let 'em roll and carry you away into the sea
To wash off all fragility
Throw yourself into the ocean
Jaded, blunt, invisible...

Invincible!

Throw yourself into the waves
Let â em roll, carry you away into the sea
To wash away all fragility
Throw yourself into the ocean
Jaded, blunt, invisible...

Placid, numb and jaded

Throw yourself into the waves
Let 'em roll and carry you away into the sea
To wash away all fragility
Throw yourself into the ocean
Jaded, blunt, invisible...

Invincible!
