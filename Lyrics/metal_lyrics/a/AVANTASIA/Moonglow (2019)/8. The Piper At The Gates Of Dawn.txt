For too long now I've been
Adrift in this ocean that washed over me

Diluting the secrets that you had to keep
From the world that's been...

...spinning around you, with and without you
Sedating, unkind

Show you the way
Deliver and faint!
Relish to stand in line!

Oh

I guess you'll find no one to blame
We're tied to the rules of someone else's game

Try to fly, flap your wings
As you look to the night sky
A gilded cage in the twilight

You dance on a wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Been caught in the mire
Now you're reaching for the stars oh oh

Oh, dance on the wire
To the breeze that carries change
Tonight you will see the Great Pan in the stars
The piper at the gates of dawn you'll hear

Oh

For quite a while I have been
The one that I thought I was happy to be

Masquerade, at least a shadow play
No one's gonna see...

...behind the fascade, those rallying calls
You're afraid to awake

Look at the sky, you can't defy
The dark that is calling your name

You're blind by the beauty around
You're numb by the touch
And you're deaf to the sound
Of the sweet-smelling
Bright melody of the moonlight
That devours the bars in the twilight

You dance on a wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Been caught in the mire
Now you're reaching for the stars oh oh

Dance on the wire
To the breeze that carries change tonight
You will see the Great Pan in the stars
The piper at the gates of dawn you'll hear

Now open your eyes, ain't it what you've been wanting
Too much to fathom, until it unfolds

Endure what you're in for, you're meant to be longing
King of the wave, now keep flailing about

We're the dream the inhabits the waking old world
We're right here, we're the doorway to guide you across

Exposed to the spirits that you're meant to be citing
Misfit and misplaced, you'll never belong

We're the breath you don't catch
We're the great expectations
You ain't measured up to on the beautiful side

We're the promise not kept - bred in desolation
We're the will of the wisp - demerged from the light

Get me out of here
Take me away
Take me
Take me
Take me away
Take me away

Dance on the wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Now you're reaching for the stars

You dance on a wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Been caught in the mire
Now you're reaching for the stars oh oh
Dance on the wire
To the breeze that carries change - tonight
You will see, the Great Pan in the stars
The Piper at the Gates of dawn is near
