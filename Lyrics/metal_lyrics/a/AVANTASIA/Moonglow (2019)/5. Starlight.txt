Walking down a lonely road
A ghost city sidewalk scene
And I wonder if there's a place
Where they bury all their unborn dreams - oh

Some castle in the sky
A place that only I can back down to
And look out for that shining guide ablaze
Out somewhere

Waiting for a sign in vain
Thatâs gonna shine away the pain
Gonna draw the moonlight down
All is gonna tumble down

Are you gonna guide me starlight
Guide me starlight
Won't you send me a sign?

You're adrift until you strand
Desert island of mundanity
You circle round your solitude
Within the walls they call austerity

I know maybe itâs insane
To dream of what you'll never gain
Nothing on the line
Driven by unsettled certainty

Waiting for a sign in vain
That's gonna shine away the pain
Gonna cite a figment down
Yet I'm gonna stick around

Are you gonna guide me starlight
Guide me starlight

Are you out there, anywhere, at all?

Anywhere at all

If only I'd burn out before I'd hit the ground
Just like you before they're near me
Run out in the clouds forever near me
I won't even be a foolish memory

Waiting for a sign in vain
Orphan star, shine on me

Waiting for a sign...

Waiting for a sign in vain
Gonna shine away the pain
Gonna draw the moonlight down
All is gonna tumble down

Are you gonna hear me starlight
Hear me starlight
Are you out there anywhere at all

Waiting for a sign...

Waiting for a sign in vain
Gonna shine away the pain
Gonna draw the moonlight down
All is gonna tumble down

Are you gonna hear me starlight
Hear me starlight
Are you out there
