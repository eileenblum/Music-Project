It ain't the far cry that it seemed
In just a wink we'd come for you
You may not feel it
We are the light, the scorching heat
We are the untold chosen few
And now we've come for you

We'll fit you like a velvet glove that's gonna choke their minds
Affiliate yourself with what you can't defy
Some below and few above
We're gonna numb their minds

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I am the seduction of decay

I hear their tales reverberate
From shrouds of myth that only time would weave
Bred in a den of lunacy
Who can we trust? Who's next in line?
The sacred drive to rationalize
Commit ourselves another day to the lesser crime
Choke on your own pace with candour
So pleasant in the quiet
Vicegerents of the tide

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay

Time contaminating space to reinfect and agonize anything around
We are metabolite of dreams
The chosen ones to sacrifice the wasteland-bound

Oh, Euphoria is looming in the darkness
Coincidence of opposites we are
Once beautiful intentions

Oh, we'll drag you over
Oh, it's gonna drag you over

Oh, from the start we run away
And don't seem to care what for
Forever feels just like a blink after passing by
Just fools don't know the prime's another state of decay

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay
