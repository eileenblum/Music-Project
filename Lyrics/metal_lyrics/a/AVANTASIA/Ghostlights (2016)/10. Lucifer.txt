Eternities ago I must have fallen
Through my pride been perfect in my ways
The morning star they fired down from heaven
Envy wrapped into a gown of grace

I hear the screams that echo from the darkness
I swerve from dawn to dusk and off the edge
Oh hear the creature crying in the distance
Buried in the symbol on a shelf

I'll take you home tonight to center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight. Fire, flesh and blood
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight

Morning star, embrace me on this grounds, angel of light

[Guitar solo]

How will I forgive him who wouldn't forgive me who just value the power?
How should I live in peace with the one, outshining me and then have me devoured?

I'm feeling alive under the skies.
Blood-shot's the moon and scarlet's the night
I'll make you fume in fury and rage.
I'll make you see what you're made of tonight

I'll take you home tonight to center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight. Fire, flesh and blood
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight
