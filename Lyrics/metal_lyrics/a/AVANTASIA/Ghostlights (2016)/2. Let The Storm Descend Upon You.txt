[Aaron:]
I'm smothered by a lucid Nothing
I can't hear and touch and see
But I feel it
Though I can't believe it

Been master of the observation
Coming up with an explanation
There's no need
Making use of the spirit

[Temptation:]
Oh, we can give you answers you are dying to receive
Keep on dreaming
Keep on screaming
Yeah

You might be getting too much for your beating heart to take
Your flesh is malice
Prepare your chalice

Light
Breathe and sleep tight
Will you defy intriguing ghost lights
Seeing through all lies and foolish warnings

[Aaron:]
There ain't no return

[Magician:]
Never light the darkness
It may burn your soul away
As you'll be seeing
What you thought you're dreaming

[Temptation:]
Never open doors if you don't dare to walk on through
It may be your vault
Now it's all your fault

[Magician:]
Light
You're off to the light
Will you defy all evil ghost lights
Tell the truth from decoration

[Scientist I:]
Time
Don't waste no time
Prevail against the hands that tick your flesh away
Now delve into your own reflection

Oh, you know that's where I've been too
There's nothing but a void over the sanity of fools

[Temptation:]
Shine your light into the darkness
Let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold and let Aurora fall upon you
Oh, let the storm descend upon you

[Aaron:]
Journey to the other side
It's just a trip and pleasure ride
And I don't know
But does it really matter?

[Temptation:]
Oh, I am he who's always been
Who dares them though I can't be seen
I'm illusion or truth
I'm confusion

[Magician:]
Light
Bring me that light

[Aaron:]
I will bring uncertainty on a silver plate
Like a mantle piece
I will wipe out darkness

Night
Blessed is the night
'Til there's no time left to spill
To save and kill
To take and seize
You just drift along

Are they reflections of some crazy dream
Or maybe the backside of reality?

[Magician:]
Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
Then I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold and let Aurora fall upon you
Let the storm descend upon you

[Scientist I:]
You gotta pray your god ain't just a ghost light
You gotta pray you won't be falling down the wayside
Let it carry you away

Cut the gem until it's purified away
The candle burning to the ground

[Aaron:]
I don't see nothing but addiction to the rhyme
Kindles everything around

[Magician:]
For all the world will see it tower to the stars
And all is melting into one

[Scientist I:]
We give them something to fall back on every time
They're too strung-out to run

[Aaron:]
Every moment, every heartbeat, every breath
Leaves you one less to your last

[Scientist I:]
Still you cherish every second of the game
Give me the future, you take the past

[Magician:]
And what if God is just an image in the mind
A reflection of the will

[Scientist I:]
And what's the matter with a lie
You live in harmony with
For a sucker, for the thrill

[Aaron:]
I pray the lord ain't just a ghost light in my mind
A reflection of the will
Let the storm descend upon me
Let Aurora fall upon me

[Temptation:]
Let the fire fall upon him
Let the fire purify him
Never judge a thing you see
It's only what your mortal eyes will want it to be
Oh, bring it on
Let the dark inhale the confusion
Spit out a conclusion

[Solo: Oliver Hartmann:]

[Aaron:]
Are they reflections or a memory
Or just reflections in a crazy dream

[Temptation:]
Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you

[Magician:]
And I will make you mine

[Temptation:]
Shine your light into the darkness

[Scientist I:]
Behold and let Aurora fall upon you

[Magician:]
Shine your light into the darkness

[Temptation:]
Into the darkness

[Magician:]
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine

[Scientist I:]
Shine your light into the darkness

[Temptation:]
Into the darkness

[Magician:]
Behold and let Aurora fall upon you
Oh, let the storm descend upon you

[Temptation:]
(let the storm descend upon you)
Oh, descend upon you, yeah
