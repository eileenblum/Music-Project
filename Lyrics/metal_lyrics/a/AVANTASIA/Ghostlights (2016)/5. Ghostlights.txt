[Mystic:]
You're tossing and turning
You think you're awake while you're trying to run
Like in a nightmare
Time loves your ego to death
You're leaving the wheelwork to the ground of being
You go on
Defying temptation in the engine room that is ourselves

[Aaron:]
I feel a storm is looming with a shaking grumble
I don't know if I'm right or wrong
I don't know if I shall go on
I don't know what I'll believe but I'm on my way

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

The world as we know it is beginning to shake
I don't trust my eyes are we all superstitious
If we think what our hearts know is true
Fireworks surround me
Wherever I go they tell me: always home
Psycho-somatic they'll name it the nature of god

[Mystic:]
Off to a new horizon
Time is the key to unite with the all
Time is gonna make you see right from wrong eternally
Don't let the noises devour you

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

[Solo: Sascha Paeth &amp; Oliver Haartmann]

[Temptation:]
And what if you're only a prism for the ghostlights that you wanna see
And we're just reflections of your dreams

[Aaron:]
It's speaking to me
It's yelling at me
It's screaming to me, resonating with me
And a thousand lights are trying to make me see
They call me home

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze
