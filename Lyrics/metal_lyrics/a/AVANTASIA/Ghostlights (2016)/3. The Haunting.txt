[Nightmare:]
I can't count the days I've roamed
A straying ghost light to wither on the vine
A paling tale of days long gone
I won't be until you close your eyes

Sleep tight
Someone's always by your side

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes, but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be, but you know it is real
We're there for you

Don't you waste your time and try
To understand this figment of the lie

Don't breathe a word to anyone
By the time you phrase me I'll be gone

Sweet dreams
See you in the twilight zone

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes, but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be, but you know it is real
We're there for you

[Aaron:]
God, I must contain my wayward fantasy
Where do all those wicked dreams come from?
Pictures in the dark, they seem so eerily
Real tonight, I pray my mind is wrong

[Solo: Sacha Paeth]

[Nightmare:]
I'm the spark they refuse to conceive

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes, but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be, but you know it is real
We're there for you
