[2x]
You shed draconian love
You shed draconian...

Welcome to your way
Seemingly endless as you take your wings
The world through kaleidoscope eyes
Until you unlearn what you keep inside

Those innocent eyes...
Refracting the light for an innocent soul
Till the cold around's not gonna wait its turn
Wait its turn no more

[Pre-chorus:]
Tell me how should I embrace?
Like roses we'll wither on the vine
Why should I bide my time
If it flies away sometime?

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through the fiery rain, angel
When will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Infiltrate us with mercy
Bait us with sympathy
Blind us with love
We're lost in the clouds rolling by
What some of us read into what they feel

Like a grain of nothing
I feel cast in the wind of enthean caprice
Of an unbred cause,
Of an unborn will
Whatever that may mean

[Pre-chorus:]
Tell me how should I embrace?
Like roses we'll wither on the vine
Tell me why should I bide my time?
If it flies away sometime

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain, angel
When will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Aspiration and tears,
Heartache and fears
Draconian love, you shed draconian love
Unrequited love â down on my knees
Draconian love, it's all draconian

Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Will you explain this draconian love?

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain
Hey, hey, hey
Will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
When will God explain this draconian love?
You she draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain...
