You see the sun touch the horizon
You know the future awaits
And yours hides in the darkness

The stars are gonna line up in the night sky
I see what some will deny
As I follow the starkness

Can you believe your eyes
We'll make you rise to the occasion
Follow your heart and run
Seek shelter from the day

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you

Wayward child wake up to the moon

They wanna squeeze you in their picture from the outside
they call your life a world of make-believe

You're feeling pushed by a racing heartbeat
Parameterizing the world
They only see what they're told to see

Child of the ocean floor
No need of daylight that deceives you
Don't let them wear you down
Listen to the voice

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you

Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon

Kind of buried alive
You've been sacrificed
They show you the key
Till you love to agree
A brave modern day
This world is insane

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic

Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon
Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon
