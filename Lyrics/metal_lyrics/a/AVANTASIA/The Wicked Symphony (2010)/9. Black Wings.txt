[Shelter]
I've been here through a million ages
I am the savior inside
Tonight I am love and justice
Tomorrow perversion to spite

And now that it's bleeding you dry
I'm calling you, I'm calling you
When temperance is bleeding you dry
I'm knocking you off the perch

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain
I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

[Shelter]
Live your tragic comedy
I'm the poison in your veins
Circumspection, vanity
You give all they can take

I am fury, I am fire, I'm the worm inside
Deliver you from self-denial tonight
When temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain

I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

[Shelter]
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to say
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to play
What not to break
When temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain
I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury
