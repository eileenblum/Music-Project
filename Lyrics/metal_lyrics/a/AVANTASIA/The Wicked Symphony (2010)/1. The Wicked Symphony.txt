[Scarecrow]
You'll be running out of miracles
Like I'm running out of dreams
Madness lurking into my left
Angels faint in front of me

And I see eyes to the right
I hear a promise resound
Gold and diamonds, love and fame
And music meant to remain

[Inspiration]
You've been dying for glory
You've been looking for love
Why don't we read the signs
When we're about to get lost

[Mephistopheles]
A seeker enthralled by a flame
Eventually home to his pain
The Great Unbeloved
You reach for the final stage

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away
Afflatus divine! Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

[Mephistopheles]
Don't you give up on your emotions
Don't you abandon your despair
If you deny what you desire
This will have been just a mystery play

There'll be nowhere to go
Just oblivion, we're so close to reach out
Close to fall, make up or break up or crawl

[Inspiration]
You are striving for beauty
For a song to remain
A final touch and the spirit you have cited
Holds on to the reins

[Scarecrow]
I feel how I'm losing my ground
A dancer enthralled by a sound
The smoke clears away
I'll reach for the final stage

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away, afflatus Divine!
Your hands and a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

[Scarecrow]
Oh I can hear it, I can hear it
Oh I can hear it, I, I, I, I...
I can hear it, yeah
I'm dying for a sign

You can turn your face away
Can pretend you don't hear it
How long have you been begging on your knees
And now that you're near it
Won't you be damned if you defy what you're given
Mercury of salvation
The colors for the eyes of the world
We'll be kings for generations

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away
Afflatus divine!
Your hands and a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony
