[Acedia]
Faces in this empty room
Cited in despair
Gazes that I had invoked
They're driving me insane now
Walls have eyes, they're staring down on me
From everywhere around

[Scarecrow]
In the face of dreams I had
Grimaces of pain
Now I am turning helpless
Callous and alone
Waiting for a storm to brew
To wash my dream of love and sins away

[Acedia]
I'm with you
I'm the other side
You just gotta try
Fly now! No one's gonna care
Cause no one's gonna know
What no one's ever seen

[Scarecrow]
Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time
Sands of time

[Acedia]
Fortune favors just the brave
That's what the blessed always say
Love will come in time
But I'm always late

I pray the wine my will to take
And those evil hands to tie
Wreaking havoc, baneful sight is growing dim

Tie the dream, I've had my fill
Raze the love and tie my will
Fires ploughing up my head
Oh forgive, I will forget

Lord, you're hiding in the haze?
The seventh door I'll try is daze
Angel send another storm to face another dawn

[Scarecrow]
Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time

Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time
