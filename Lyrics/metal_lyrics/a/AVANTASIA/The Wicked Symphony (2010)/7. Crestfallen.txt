[Scarecrow]
Ill-defined as I look in the mirror
Am I blind, am I blind
Am I given or just a straying fool
Feel it near
Something's here to watch

I feel their eyes sending shivers down my spine
Evil eyes, evil eyes
See me crawling as I'm falling off the edge
Paralyze, tantalize

Feel it there
From everywhere it sounds

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

[Mephistopheles]
Hey - desperation
Angels crashing from the sky
How can you hold on to your way
In your mental disarray
I am your struggles
The answer to your pain
I am the fury in your eyes
I am reason, I am vice

It's there
From everywhere it sounds

[Scarecrow]
And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you
