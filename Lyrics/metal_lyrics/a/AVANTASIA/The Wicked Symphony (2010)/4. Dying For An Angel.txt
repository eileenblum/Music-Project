[Scarecrow]
You're awake in your darkest dream
I have come for you

[Future Scarecrow]
And nobody can hear you scream
When I reach for you

[Scarecrow]
Don't you remember their feet in your face
Before they have carved you in stone

[Future Scarecrow]
And don't you remember your sweat and your pain
When you were drawn to the bone
When you were left all alone

[All]
Living on a dream
Dying for an angel
Reach out, waiting for a miracle
No sign of wings, as you turn your back on me

Living on a dream
Lonely, cold and dire
Head up, feet down in the fire
Give until you're gone
Dying for an angel
Everyday

[Scarecrow]
Where do we go from the apogee
What do we leave behind
And how will I stand what I'll have to see
This reflection of mine

[Future Scarecrow]
Collateral damage, your sacrifice
Gotta learn to fly and learn to fall
Gonna tear down the walls of love and lies
You have come on your own
You will go on all alone

[All]
Living on a dream
Dying for an angel
Reach out, waiting for a miracle
No sign of wings, as you turn your back on me

Living on a dream
Lonely, cold and dire
Head up, feet down in the fire
Give until you're gone
Dying for an angel
Everyday
