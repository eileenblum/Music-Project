[Music &amp; lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

I envision how you lie awake and agonise
Over ways to bear your day just every night
Re-alignment you're in need of so imploringly
It's the pace that we'll maintain for you

Oh every moment everybody's gonna think alike
Every second will be seized
While every in between we'll erase
To take the tangle from their memory
Maximising one and all for you

Now into line bring them peace of mind
Mind by mind
Se the pace for all mankind
Let us take away the spaces
In between their given time

Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

Now am I half asleep or half unconscious, 
Half 'adream'?
I can't move as I am stuck in bright lucidity
I can feel and hear and see
But I won't comprehend
I see fire that I won't decipher

I see giant evil tower to a blackened sky
I feel blessed with evidence of what I can't define
Swinging blade of the lowering perpendicular
I see clarity I won't remember

Do I dream
Is it only fantasy and matter just a thought I see
And time is all they need to seal away eternity

Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

You pry into a world too far above
Your head up in the haze
Journey to the birth of the first sun
Into the black womb of space
Father primal space oh yeah
Who's drawn the lightâ¦

Standing at the door to epiphanic realisation
A journey to the centre of forever
To the mystery of creation

Don't you hear the voice: I'm with you
I'm everywhere and real
You can see me, you can hear me without credence
I'm what your hands can feel

God, I feel I've been away too long
I feel like I've been dreaming

If you'd open up your door to explanation
You would hear the voice of reason screaming

I've seen the ocean swallow the ancient harmony
And I've seen belief and craving swallow sanity

I feel my hand is led to ink between the lines
Tall stories legendising: figments of the lie

At crack of dawn hazy remains above my mind
Raise your mind
I scribble down those icons that I can't define
Will they demand account as I'd demand myself
Raise your mind
I'll never testify what no man comprehends

And they will tear to pieces what they can't define
Raise your mind
If you don't follow your self- preservation drive
They'll crucify the one who won't affiliate
Raise your mind
But decorate the children of their own ego's way

Time to run savior in the clockwork
Tell me for how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on
(time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork

Take me back inside
In between the time
Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time
