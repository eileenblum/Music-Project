[Bonus Track]Living in the darkness
What a cold and lonely night
Voices in the darkness
Sing a sweet sweet lullaby

Something's coming nearer
Anyone to join in game? A game
Welcome to the attic
Hospitality is my name

Eyes so alive
I've been feeling pretty dead
For quite a while
Gimme a smile

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

Don't hesitate to sign right here
Don't be afraid to come with me
Specialized in temporizing
Dead to faulty love and time

Faulty time
We'll be dancing right here
Forever and a while
Day by day

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds

Value by value
I'm gonna turn into breath after breath
Love we trade in for silver
Defy what they use to call death
And dust covered treasures will shine again
An unseen accolade
Larger than life, a memory
Death will be just a charade

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale
