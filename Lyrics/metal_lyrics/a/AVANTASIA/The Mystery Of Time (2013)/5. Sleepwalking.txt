[Music &amp; lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

Wandering barefoot into nowhere
Just another winter's night
And I don't fell gravity anymore
You'd never lie, never cry
Never talk me out of dreams
And a dream is what remains

Tell me don't you see what ain't there
When you look in the mirror
You're starving away like a candle burning down
Miles, away miles away
You've been cutting off the rope
Letting go and losing ground

And Iâ¦
Wonder who's to blame
As Iâ¦
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And Iâ¦
Sleepwalk in the rain

Winter sky far and wide 
Caving in on you and me
Like a brittle wall of the emerald room:
The hall of fame and dying dreams
The love we'd die for: Petrified
I wanna know: Does a frozen river flow

And Iâ¦
Wonder who's to blame
As Iâ¦
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And Iâ¦
Sleepwalk in the rain

And Iâ¦
Wonder who's to blame
As Iâ¦
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And Iâ¦
Sleepwalk in the rain
