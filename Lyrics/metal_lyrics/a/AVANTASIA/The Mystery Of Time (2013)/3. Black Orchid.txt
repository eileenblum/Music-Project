[Music &amp; lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Aaron Blackwell]
I never wanted guidance
To tell me where to find
A light in the darkness
Cause the dark I'd push aside
No time for dreaming of a distant Paradise
No time for tales of good and evil

[Reason]
Another correlation: as above so below
Another analysing where illusions fail to show
the face of the maker who'd leave you alone
without a sense of comprehension

[Aaron Blackwell]
When the meadow - in front of my eyes - will have dried away
Will my senses wither like flowers on my grave
Will this wave of becoming flow into the void of time

The final hour:
When Never and Now become one
Will I find the orchid
The final hour:
Door to the garth of eternity?
Or withered orchid meadows?

[Reason]
Everybody's praying
But what if God is just a threat
and everybody's straying?
If only they would just forget
everybody's craving
for a ghost light in the haye:
You'll lose your minds one after another

[Aaron Blackwell]
Everybody's craving
for what doesn't have a name or a face
So reason could fit it in the frame
In quest of the orchid:
A glimmer in the daze
Till I awake to the sound of rigour

[Reason]
What if that meadow in your mind is just a fantasy?
And if it wanted to be seen why must you believe?

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will this wave of becoming flow into the void of time

[Reason]
The final hour
When Never and Now become one

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will I find the orchid

[Reason]
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Aaron Blackwell]
Or withered orchid meadows

Black orchid
Strange and beautiful
Oh black orchid I must find you

[Reason]
I remember that morning
He had to be told
What he couldn't remember
After he'd spoken to the wall

[Aaron Blackwell]
And I gave to repression
What I must not have seen
What even believers
Must unlearn to unbelieve

[Lead Guitar: Bruce Kulick]

[Aaron Blackwell]
The final hour
When Never and Now become one
Will I find the orchid
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Reason]
Or withered orchids
The final hour
When Never and Now become one

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will I find the orchid

[Reason]
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Aaron Blackwell]
Or withered black orchid meadows
