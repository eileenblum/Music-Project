Lord above - why don't you tell me
why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
now I'm caught in misery

I've been praised by friar Jakob,
I misused his confidence
Cheated by this work of evil
feigning Anna's innocence

Oh what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Oh what have I done?
What is going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation  no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt
I remember words of "seven"
Set me free - sanity!

Reach out for the light
far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

What is right and what is wrong now?
Is it a trial of paradise?

Is Anna a witch or do they stick to an error?
What's the book and the seal inside?

Am I a cleric or maybe a sinner?
Unbeliever? Renegade?
Was it the devil who led me to "seven"?
Oh redeemer is it all too late?

Oh, what have I done?
I have been led by the smelling one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Tell me stranger, what have I done?
Oh what's going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation  no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt
I remember words of "seven"
Set me free - sanity!

Reach out for the light
far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

In your mind?
