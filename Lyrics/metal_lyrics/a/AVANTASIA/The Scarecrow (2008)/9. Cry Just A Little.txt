[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Bob Catley]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
A heart out of affection, night at the masquerade
You won some and you're lonesome as the spotlight fades
Going forth pretending destination is at hand
When she's crying just a little just for me

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
I've seen them set off to the Promised Land
Escaping from the hurtings they don't understand
A sense of satisfaction on account of pristine tears
She's crying just a little more just like you

No, oh, no, no

[Chorus (Scarecrow):]
Why don't you cry, cry a little over me?
Why don't you lie?
Can't you tell me that I am hard to deny?
Can't you see what I am going through?
Cry just a little for me,
Oh, girl, a little for me

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
Afraid to give away what you keep inside
There's a ghost in your mirror every lonesome night
All those nights are getting colder and your heart's a frozen wound
Don't you wonder who'll be there when you awake?

No, oh

[Chorus 2x]
