[Vocals by Tobias Sammet, Michael Kiske and Bob Catley]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Like a wheel I keep on turning
Straight ahead, it's got me burning
The melody â the dignity,
Something is speaking to me
Night is cold and my soul is battered
Not afraid for the first time now that I realize
We coincide, I'll never belong to the tribe
And a song is calling me to this ship of fools

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When you find your love on wasted grounds
You're taking to the sound,
It's shelter from the rain

[Mentor (Michael Kiske):]
No return from the way I've chosen,
Cast away - chasing rainbows - condemn the lie
And how could I make god believe I am blind?
We create by intuition,
Call it fate â the tongue of angels in our soul
Feel it resound and carry you over the grind
All that's left is a song giving shelter from the rain

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When I find my love on wasted grounds
I'm taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
It's a dark and stormy night.
Ain't it funny what it takes to read the signs?
But I am always there,
I am the footprints to your right
Man overlooks when riding high, young and blind
In your darkest lonely night,
Heed a voice to take you higher
Take you higher
As you stumble through the ruins, let the spirit take you higher, and a soul

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Oh, and a song
I can hear a song

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When you find your love on wasted grounds
You're taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When I find my love on wasted grounds
I'm taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain
