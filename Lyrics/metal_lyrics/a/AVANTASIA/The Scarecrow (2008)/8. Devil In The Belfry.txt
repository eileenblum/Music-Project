[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Jorn Lande]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I dropped off in the shadows
The lead of a tragedy
I open my eyes â blind by the spotlight
And what do I see?

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Pushed by ambition,
Been granted admission
To the hall of acclaim,
She denied your affection,
Now listen, the whole world is screaming your name

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I will forget her but I won't forgive
The curtain has fallen, behold the messiah

[Chorus:]
Riding high,
The devil on the crest for all the world to see forevermore
I am I â
Devil in the belfry, I'll be glorified forevermore

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Is it a sin to learn to be able to live without love?
And is it a sin to put love under will and control from above?

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Devil in my fingers, pleasure at my feet
Mind out of sight
The shadow I'll cast shall darken her world
And ghost her at night

With each song you'll die a little for me
It won't leave a scar, 'cause I've drawn the curtain

[Chorus 2x]

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Into the opera like moths to the flame
Spellbind their senses to follow the hero

[Chorus 2x]
