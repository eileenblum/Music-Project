[Scarecrow]
I've been walking down this road
With a suitcase full of dreams
I've seen my demons come and go
To show me what I need

Madness, walking dynamite
Been dancing on the edge
They got me by the fuse
Smiling with a match

I wanted love, I wanted life
Been striving for a new direction
I wanted out, I wanted more
I wanted to forget the damage left behind

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember

I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

[Mephistopheles]
Raise your head
Got stars above and emptiness below
Think of what you'd never had
And would have never known

You wanna turn your back on me
Condemn this pleasure dome
Make sure you won't regret
Mistaking friend for foe, no

You're at the gates,
You're on the edge,
I've seen them falling back to nowhere,
You're off the red, out of your head,
And you will wish you'd never seen it all

[Scarecrow]
I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

Oh, and I recall I used to have a dream
I won't forget that moment of glory

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember

I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Alone I remember

I recall, I recall the dream that I had
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember
