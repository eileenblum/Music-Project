[Madman]
Living in the darkness
What a cold and lonely night
Voices in the darkness
Sing a sweet sweet lullaby

Something's coming nearer
Anyone to join in a game, a game?
Welcome to the attic
Hospitality is my name

Eyes so alive
I've been feeling pretty dead for quite a while
Gimme a smile

Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

Don't hesitate to sign right here
Don't be afraid to come with me
Specialized in temporizing
Dead to faulty love and time, faulty time
We'll be dancing here forever and a while
Day by day

Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds

[Scarecrow]
Value by value
I'm gonna turn into breath after breath
Love we trade in for silver
Defy what they use to call death
And dust covered treasures will shine again
An unseen accolade
Larger than life, a memory
Death will be just a charade

[Madman]
Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale
