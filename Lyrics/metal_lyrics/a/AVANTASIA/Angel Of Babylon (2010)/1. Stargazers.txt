[Scarecrow]
We have roamed the plains a million years
Gathered at the shore
When we had run out off all fears

[Inspiration]
We have come from everywhere
Crumbling worlds behind
Reason is what we're gonna give
To be given peace of mind

[Mephistopheles]
Crimson is the pavement
Blood is dripping from our dreams
To the sound of smashing yesterdays
We dance in ecstasy

[Scarecrow]
Oh craving devour me, take me away
Oh to infinity, take me away

[Mephistopheles]
Take me away
Oh yeah take me away
Far away

[Scarecrow]
Don't you turn your face to the night sky
Said the fainthearted one
You may see through the charades
An instant that won't come undone

I can feel the ease of my pain
Decline of the blood reason level
Gazing in awe bystanders scream
Mentally critical fettle

[Mentor]
We're sailing on gentle waves
We read the sky

Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity
Reason left behind

[Scarecrow]
Where are you detecting the wrongs
Spirit that always denies
I've gone insane
Release me from waiting
For the sparkle to rise

[Mephistopheles]
I can see they're nailed to the cross
Cannot live till they're gone
Immortal they cry on terrestrial embers
While they laugh at the clown

[Mentor]
You feel a chill as if time stood still
There's no way out

Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
For a lucid dream
You'll leave the world behind

[Scarecrow]
Oh craving devour me
Release me, please, take me away
To infinity, oh take me away
Craving devour me
Take me, take me away

[Mentor]
Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity, reason left behind

[Darkness]
When the sun rose to wake another day
they were gone, gone without a trace
Babylon, craving in lucidity
Babylon, the fire will remain

And the sun razes from their memory
What the dark had cyphered in the sky
And the flame's burning their lucidity
Babylon, rise up to the night

[Mephistopheles]
Oh, let us wander
let us wander between the worlds
We override their principles
Abrogate horizons
Abandon mental gravity
Oh, we overrule the eye
Compromise your sanity
To heaven
To hell
