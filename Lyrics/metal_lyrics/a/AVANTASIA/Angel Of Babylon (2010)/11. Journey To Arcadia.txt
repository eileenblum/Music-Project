[Conscience]
A lonely boy, a handful of dreams
Cold wind blows through a heart wired-in
Open skies he would explore
No, there ain't no mastery
Of a passion and a deep blue love

Yearn to see far away places
One day he'd feel two hearts collide
In his eyes tears and desire
But he prays and he swears every night
One day scales will fall from her eyes

[Inspiration]
Just with a dream
Just with a dream and with a song
On my own, I may stumble and fall
It don't matter at all when you're blessed with
Just what's yet to come, what's yet to come

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got your head in the clouds
You're out to find Arcadia
And you know you will stand
What you can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Scarecrow]
The more I see, I understand
That there ain't nothing that I know
As I awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

When dogs run barking
And I don't hear no sound
And the sky is as blue
As eyes have never seen it
Then I remember
What I'd have been dying for
Faith, rescue my dream
From a role that I've been put in on their screen

[Inspiration]
Your eyes, and as I look into your eyes
We're at the crack of dawn
Life will stop telling lies
And destiny will know
It's just you and I

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got my head in the clouds
Journey to Arcadia
And I know I will stand
What I can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Conscience]
The more we see, we understand
That there's a lot that we don't know
As you awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

[Scarecrow]
Far from eye but close to heart
No matter how we try
Can't repel the counterpart
Our common bond we can't defy

[Inspiration]
I've seen them standing at the crossroads
When they were waiting for a sign
And they unlearned to face the silence
As they unlearned to turn inside

You're turning to the sky
And you're dying for an angel
If you want it bad enough, see those eyes
That's where two glances collide

Learn to breathe, learn to crawl
Learn to stand, walk and fall
Learn to lose and to love, to believe, to rise above
Love is more than to love

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got your head in the clouds
You're out to find Arcadia
And you know you will stand
What you can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Scarecrow]
The more I've seen, I understand
That there ain't nothing that I know now
As I awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show
