Why do I look to you?
To redeem and fulfill
To starve and deprive
The whole of my will

And yet I look to you

One way to bring it down
Listen, for these words are my way

And yet I look to you

Why do I look to you?
In the wake of the turning hour
To hold and sip
Upon all that has soured

And yet I look to you

One way to bring it down
Listen, for these words are my way
