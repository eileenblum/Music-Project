I'm so sorry to hear of your bitter loss
I know my words can only offer but so much comfort for you
Just know that I am here to ease your lonely feelings
To fill this time of grieving and remind you it's your fault
It's your fault for not caring
It's your fault for not knowing that he'd try again
And again, these words can only offer
But so much comfort for you
(Now here's where I should say that "he's in a better place"
but on the day he died, I could have sworn)
There came the strangest sound
It was as if the whole of heaven came crumbling
Fucking down!  His last words shall shine in truthfulness -
"I hate you all!", scattered with his ashes upon your guilt.
I'm sure you must have done all that was in your power
To prevent this event from occurring
Just remember, I feel that it is entirely your fault
But again, these words can only offer
But so much comfort for you.
