Sensations, curse me and my ways
Force-feed me blind on empty days

Today, my faith was lost again
A grave was dug to mourn its loss
And in this grave I keep my friends
Loneliness, impure urges
And the pain that only I can bring

A mouthful of dust and guilt
A season of haste and wilt

And to this day I'll search for you
To nurse and clean
My mouthful of dust and guilt

Come forever
Come blindness
Come bringing forth
The pain of logic and reason
That hides in here
And for my dreams I'll pay dearly
Forfeit my rights to see clearly
Your flaws, my flaws
In all of our ways
