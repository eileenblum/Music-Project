My reverence for you is gone, stand alone and be counted
My time with you was like time alone in a grave
Stand apart or unite in regret
To the west of god
Passion alone in the must
I am the wolf at your door
I am the wounds on your wrists
Vengeance is the marriage bed
I cower towards you in wonder
Was it your emptiness that pushed me away or your hatred that drew me near?
