Courting with pain, the dirtiest whore
I laid my lips on the filthiest swine
Years later I'm still sipping
On the drippings of your spilt wine

Standing west of god
We are united in regret
Your blemishes must never fade like portraits where ink and skin meet
Standing west of god
We are united in regret
