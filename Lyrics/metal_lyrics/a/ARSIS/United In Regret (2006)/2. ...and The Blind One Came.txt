Lugosi's child bears his namesake
Within in this monument we hide from shame, from uncontrolled emotions and untold atrocities
Be enlightened lonely angel
We're forever with you
And the blind one came in the likeness of you
And the blind one came to make timeless all that is you

Behind the walls of the is monument
Your tribute to deceit all time is lost to the innocent
Your evil they must repeat
