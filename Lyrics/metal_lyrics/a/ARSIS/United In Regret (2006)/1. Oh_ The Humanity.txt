A false confession sprayed forth from the mouth of disdain
What words spoken?
What love swayed?
And the mirror broken brings the faith of the damned to me.
This is how the lost ones feel in love and life
Close your legs when vanity's forlorn
Close your legs before I close them for you

Close your legs and in time properly behold... oh the humanity
The heart of love bereaved with hollow eyes and a whisper waiting for words to fill the lies
A heart's rejection sprang quick and laid claim to me
Where's reason when love's swayed and the broken mirror brings the faith of the damned to me?
