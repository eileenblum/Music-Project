You whose amber eyes are the curse of all loneliness
Who greets life with a kiss of indifference
You whose vanity must guide the garden path and surely surpass your suffocating pride
Consummate in selfish ways, have I lost my will?
Lost sense of self, it is done. I know I must be.. falling forever when bonds start to sever
I know I'll hope and pray you've had your fill
The promise of never was my oath forever
I know I hope and pray you've had your fill of lust before the maggots conquest
Your mark about my neck
A keepsake of your vanity and when swollen fears are forever mine this is true, I know I must be...
Forever touched by the fire, was it your innocence that kept me at bay?
Time was not mine, I was forever
The wolf at the door shrouded with greed.
