Vanity found a home in heart of your embrace
Once was lost is mine again in the paleness of your eyes
Vanity tainted all of your lonely face

Indifference was welcoming in and fervor laid to fucking waste
Once was lost is now mine again
Love found tarnished in the fists of enemies
Now I speak through shadows
