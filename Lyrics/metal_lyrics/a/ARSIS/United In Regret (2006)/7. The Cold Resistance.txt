Cobwebs reaching from the heavens to the lover's plague
A soul strung out on shadows and the killing words brings the fervor to a halt
Far beyond the solace of hatred that tarnished and banished all thoughts of you
A storm of ill-wishes brought the cold resistance, you were nice to know

Three words beaten into emptiness, never spoken the same
The size of my hatred can never equal your indifference
Now the fervor's at a halt when your past is a dirty whore, a fervor even wrought in steel cannot replace this monument
