The fight with in for all
The second for only I
Now in proper sleep

They start asking
What I witnessed in life

The haunted
The fragile
The frozen words for you

This we not
Won't forget
In the nightmare for your life
Please help me out
For I have failed to die
Please help me out
We were not meant to stay

At least we're abandoned
where the wicked long to hide
Put our peace has all but furnished
In a ride six coffins wide

The haunted
The fragile
The frozen words for you
This weakness
The haunted
In nightmares

Six coffins wide
They are closing in
They are throwing you
I will never die

Six coffins wide
They are closing in
They are throwing you
I will never die

Please help me out
For I have failed to die
Please help me out
We were not meant to stay
Six coffins wide (six coffins wide)
Six coffins wide
I will never die
