I will end this fight tonight.
Revenge is what I have in mind.
With these words, my words, just let it be known
I will haunt you wherever you go.

Let me be the one all lovers despise,
the one whose bane you cannot disguise.
So it is done and forever mine,
this bloodtainted curse written with your lies.

I will end this fight tonight.
Revenge is what I have in mind.
With these words, my words, just let it be known
I will haunt you wherever you go.

Let me be the one all lovers resent,
the foulest wretch who will not repent.
You said you only wanted to see me,
well just click your heels, there's no place like hell.

[Ellis]

I am here to suffer divine.
This bloodtainted curse is forever mine.
To this pain and its ascent
I am the wretch who will not repent.
I will not repent.

I will end this fight tonight.
Revenge is what I have in mind.
With these words, my words, just let it be known
I will haunt you wherever you go.
I will haunt you.
