Dead, what has come to be
the drowning eyes of the wretched sea
A diseased victim of humanity,
a soul sickened by this decree.

Can you hide what your tongue conceals?
How does it feel?
You were lying with the dead.

Did you notice when the cross went cold?
That's when I knew I would not grow old.
Yes, I noticed when the cross went cold.
I always knew I would never grow old.

Was it your vanity or in my head?
Does not matter now.
No one lies to the...

Dead to this life perverse.
Condemned to carry this poison curse.
You cannot hide what my eyes can see.
This was never real.
No one lies to the dead.

[Malone]

Yes I noticed when the cross went cold.
I always knew I would never grow old.
Was it your vanity or in my head?
Does not matter now.
No one lies to the dead.
