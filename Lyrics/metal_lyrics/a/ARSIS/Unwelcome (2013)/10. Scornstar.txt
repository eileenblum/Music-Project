Piercing my penance
The revilement of your ways
Now with eyes betrayed
And my sorrow denied

Regret would stay and follow your side
Loving only your life
Until that day
That day [3x]

That day that I forgot
That you're the one
A call from chaos had begun
And my faith could only run

At least I know you're not the one
Scorn made my acquaintance
Where the twisted crosses lay
No remorse inside

We could not be saved
With the lies of winter
I came undone
But now I am certain

You're not the one
You are not the one
Piercing my penance
With eyes betrayed

Scorn my acquaintance
On twisted crosses lay
Now the ravens
They circle you

And my plea for penance
Is not through
My heart was only
In your way

Now that has changed
It changed on that day
That day [3x]
That day that I forgot

That you're the one
A call from chaos had begun
And my faith could only run
At least I know you're not the one
