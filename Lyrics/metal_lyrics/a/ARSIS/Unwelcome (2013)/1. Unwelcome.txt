I have lain
With evil
And with evil by my side
But the devil could not be your rival

And neither could i
Release me from this night
And the pain that is tomorrow
For now you don't believe

But revenge is soon to follow
You!
With all your hatred and distrust
This is no longer the life we knew

We live in our disgust
With all the scorn
Of my will
I did not ask for this

With the regret that haunts me still
Vengeance flows from my wrist
Release me from this night
And the pain that is tomorrow

For now you don't believe
But revenge is soon to follow
You!
This is where it comes undone

In my world
You are not welcome
You!
With all your hatred and disgust

This is
Disgust
Now disease has fallen
Fallen upon my will

And this shadow
Of spite and scorn
Lays with your evil still
Release me from this night

And the pain that is tomorrow
For now you don't believe
My revenge is soon to follow
You!

This is where it comes undone
In my world
You are not welcome

This is where it comes undone
In my world 
You are not welcome
