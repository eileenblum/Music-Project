My fear was filling the night,
frozen tongues screaming for the light.
A whisper on my breath,
my faith is out of sight, forever.
Forever is what we were told,
but the oath is withered.

The vows are all broken,
and cursed is my name.
I hear yours spoken,
I share in this shame.

We are mourning, with our souls relieved.
Now victim, the beast that time unleashed.
We are mourning, with our souls bereaved.
We are fallen, the beast that time unleashed.

[Cordle]

In the passion for the flame,
the winds of doubt, they came.
Frozen tongues screaming for the light,
and this memory was slain.
Forever is what we were told,
but the oath is withered.

The vows are all broken, and cursed is my name.
I hear yours spoken, I share in this shame.
We are mourning, with our souls bereaved.
We are fallen, the beast that time unleashed.
