[Solo: Knight]
[Solo: Malone]

Your lowering breath reeks of penance,
with blinded eyes and severed tongue.
Your foulest words greet the knowledge,
with Denial's only son.

We are the ones who've chosen silence,
Whose blinded eyes can see the truth.
We are the ones who've chosen silence,
On hopeless winds of stolen grief.

The conquest of failure was in the heart of you,
By the eyes of winter, denial was renewed.

The conquest of failure was in the heart of you,
By the eyes of winter, denial was renewed.

This is failure's conquest!
This is failure's conquest!
This is failure's conquest!

Your lowering breath reeks of penance,
with blinded eyes and severed tongue.
Your foulest words greet the knowledge,
with Denial's only son.

[Solo: Knight]
[Solo: Malone]

Your grief came with the frailest words,
your severed tongue ever spoke.
The aura of mourn that once dwelled,
now wears the madness mark!

We are the ones who've chosen silence,
Whose blinded eyes can see the truth.
We are the ones who've chosen silence,
On hopeless winds of stolen grief.

The conquest of failure was in the heart of you,
By the eyes of winter, denial was renewed.
