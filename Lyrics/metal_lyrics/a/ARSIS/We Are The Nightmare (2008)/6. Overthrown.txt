Aside from the memories
This life and curse has failed us.
Dreams lost to the greyest light
Awoke screaming with bloodless eyes.

So end it now,
and see yourself,
So end it now,
this life has cursed us.

And like the night, where anger can survive
you and I will be walking a tightrope.

And like the night, where anger can survive,
you and I will be over, overthrown.

Every moment that came and went
That cursed and crushed our innocence.
And we all must realize
That no spells can save us.

And like the night, where anger can survive
you and I will be walking a tightrope.

And like the night, where anger can survive
you and I will be over, overthrown.

[Solo: Knight]

So end it now, and see yourself
So end it now, this world has cursed us
So end it now, and see yourself
So end it now, this world has cursed us

[Solo: Malone]

And like the night, where anger can survive
you and I will be walking a tightrope.

And like the night, where anger can survive
you and I will be over, overthrown.
