The congregation mourn the pale and listless,
Sullen eyes were blind to you
Then let blindness be their only truth,
Sightless wisdom in the shade of longing

For failure comes in many disguises, vicious flaws entombed by prose
Then let this grave hold their only secret,
Sightless wisdom in the shade of longing

Upon these grounds dwells an aura of mourn where every womb-bound soul shall awaken stillborn

The congregation celebrate their shame,
Sullen eyes blinded by guilt
Then let this guilt be their only virtue,
United by their flaws

Upon these grounds dwells an aura of mourn where every womb-bound soul shall awaken stillborn

Let blindness be their only truth
Let guilt be their only virtue
Let this grave hold their only secret
Sightless wisdom in the shade of longing

Upon these grounds dwells an aura of mourn where every womb-bound soul shall awake stillborn.
