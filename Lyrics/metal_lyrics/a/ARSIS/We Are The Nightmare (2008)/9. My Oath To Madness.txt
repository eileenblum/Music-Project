Awake, awake for the dream has failed
and failure speaks the purest truth.
Time was lost before our eyes,
now on your knees to worship depravity.

My oath to madness whispered seven times,
can hold the answer within all these lies.

My oath to madness, within seven breaths,
can hold the answer and the weight of lies.

This is my oath to the lie.

Scream, scream for vindication,
for madness comes in many waves.

Blindness was left behind
and consciousness vanishes beneath the waves.

My oath to madness whispered seven times,
can hold the answer within all these lies.

My oath to madness, within seven breaths,
can hold the answer and the weight of lies.

This is my oath to the lie!
This is my oath to the madness!

[Solo: Knight]
[Solo: Malone]

My oath to madness whispered seven times,
can hold the answer within all these lies.

My oath to madness, within seven breaths,
can hold the answer and the weight of lies.

This is my oath to the lie!
This is my oath to the madness!
This is my oath to the lie!
This is my oath to the madness!
