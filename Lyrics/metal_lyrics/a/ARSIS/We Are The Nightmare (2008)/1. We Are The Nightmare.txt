Two figures ride towards the sunset.
Searching for truth, only one shall return.
Bring it down, tonight.
Reprisal for our loss.
We are the nightmare, the chosen silence.
We are the night.

Three words to praise the reached.
Those wretched eyes of the drowning man.
This timeless lie won't stand.
This timeless lie won't stand.
Caught in the dream of this midnight stare.
These are our past sins, we are the nightmare.
When shame and deceit lay too close to me...
This was your worse sin, now it's my nightmare.

[Solo: Malone]
[Solo: Knight]

Bring it down, tonight.
Reprisal for our loss.
We are the nightmare, the chosen silence.
We are...

The night fell swiftly in the shade of shame, cloaked in deceit.
Blind to all except the wretched eyes of the drowning man.

Two figures ride towards the sunset.
Searching for truth, only one can survive the wrath of deceit.
Flowing in our veins, drowning our last breath.

Bring it down, tonight.
Reprisal for our loss.
We are the nightmare, the chosen silence.
We are the night.

Caught in the dream of this midnight stare.
These are your past sins, we are the nightmare.
When shame and deceit lay too close to me...
This was your worse sin, now it's my nightmare.

Caught in the dream of this midnight stare.
These are your past sins, we are the nightmare.
When shame and deceit lay too close to me...
This was your worse sin, now it's my nightmare.
