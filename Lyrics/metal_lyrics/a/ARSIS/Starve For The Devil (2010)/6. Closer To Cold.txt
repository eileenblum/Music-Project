All that I know, erased by lies
That have eaten my memories away
I walk words towards fate
Step by step
Closer to cold
The rise of emptiness

Closer to cold
Guilt unites with regret
I have taken starvation
As my one and only bride
Chosen to live life as a disease personified
And in the call of winter, I learned the words to make it stop

An oath, a pact with sickness
We must always walk hand in hand
Closer to cold the rise of emptiness
Closer to cold
Guilt unites with regret

I am veiled in tears of scarlet mourn
One step closer to cold
All reason is unborn
By the chant of seven whistlers tune
We grow closer to death beneath this cold and blood dimmed moon
Closer to cold
The rise of emptiness
Closer to cold
Guilt unites with regret

[Solo: Nick]

All that I know, erased by lies
That have eaten my memories away
I walk towards fate
Step by step

[Solo: James; Nick]

By the chant of seven whistlers tune
We grow closer to death beneath this cold and blood dimmed moon
Closer to cold
The rise of emptiness
Closer to cold
Guilt unites with regret
