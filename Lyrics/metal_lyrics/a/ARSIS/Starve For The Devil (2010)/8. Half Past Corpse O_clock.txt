We mourn the pale and listless
Itâs half past corpse oâclock
Praise the sick, hail the twisted
Sell your soul itâs time to rock
Letâs celebrate our lifeâs failures
That we are forced to repeat
Breed the bastard despite the knowledge
That with flesh comes deceit
With a blind oath to madness we are forced to rebel
Wearing a badge of our shame letâs starve for the devil!

How long I have tried to separate my guilt from all of my lies
How long you have tried to see beyond the emptiness of my eyes
A curse to grant your wishes
When itâs half past corpse oâclock
Realize your reasonâs twisted
Starve your soul, itâs time to rot
Letâs forget ever moment
For human life is frail
And all I know for certain
Is that the mirror shows us hell
With a blind oath to madness we are forced to rebel
Wearing a badge of our shame letâs starve for the devil!

How long I have tried to separate my guilt from all of my lies
How long you have tried to see beyond the emptiness of my eyes
The blindness of our eyes and the madness that it brings
The seven whispers are silent as a carcass choir sings

[Solo: Nick]

How long I have tried to separate my guilt from all of my lies
How long have you tried to see beyond the emptiness of my eyes?
