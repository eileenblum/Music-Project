[Music and lyrics by James Malone]

[Lead Theme: James]

The dreams of others
Wither by light of day
When the truth's uncovered
You will find me wasting away

A dark curse upon me
Flesh bound to the whipping post
Hunted and haunted
Stalked by nostalgia the memory of a ghost

Beyond forlorn, the answers lie in loneliness
Disease reborn, I am so full on emptiness

In the heart of torture
Came the vulture's melody
To grant my wishes
A pardon from this malady.

A drop of poison
Just a drop to call the armies off
A chance for release
For release is all I ever want

Beyond forlorn, the answers lie in loneliness
Disease reborn, I am so full on emptiness
The greed that blankets passion
Keeps all of our grief in fashion
And as the fervor slowly dies
I damn my soul to open up the sky.

[Lead Theme: James]

[Solo: James]
[Solo: Nick]

From this failing temple
Draped in scarlet shrouds
The starving statue
Looks on and speaks aloud

Locked inside the famine chamber
I am the prince of emaciation
Under the spell of the coldest slender
Grant me my wish, release the poison.

A dark curse upon me
Flesh bound to the whipping post
A drop of poison
Just a drop to call the armies off.

Beyond forlorn
The answers lie in loneliness
Disease reborn
I am so full on emptiness
The greed  that blankets passion
Keeps all of our grief in fashion

Beyond forlorn,
Stalked by nostalgia
My memories are your ghost.
