[Lead Theme: Nick]

Take hold and feel the flames that we control, this hell can feed our shame and
cleanse the soul
And though I choose to walk this path
And face the plague of reasonâs wrath
The graven songs and tortured words
Of a thousand liars shall be my bible

The art of self denial
A bloody hangmanâs trial
All ways to praise the works
Of the escape artist
This cold resistance cannot fail me now
It holds the pleasures sick perfection wonât allow
And though all self has been denied
Iâve reached the level few have tried
And at the side of the beast
I am seated for the famine feast

The art of self denial
A bloody hangmanâs trial
All ways to praise the works
Of the escape artist
Theses eyes are longing for release
Yet the coldness follows me
These eyes are longing for release
This is famine
