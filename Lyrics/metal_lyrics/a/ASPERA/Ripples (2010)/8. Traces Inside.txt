You never told us where you were
You never said anything
I cried myself to sleep at night
Did you even care for us?

You had a choice but let me down
Disappointment, silent torment
I remember being pushed to the edge
And being torn apart

How could you do this to us?
How could you make us suffer?

And now..

I'm burning inside,
But I don't blame you for the pain
I am still bleeding, and I am shattered

Still you're the same, still it's you I should blame
Although you had your reasons, you never had to act like you did
Feeling sweat, feeling cold, I'm so left alone
Disappointment, silent torment
The picture of you slowly fades to grey, I feel sick

How could you do this to us?
How could you make us suffer?

And now..

I'm burning inside,
But I don't blame you for the pain
I am still bleeding, and I am shattered

Seek the traces inside
Feel the traces inside
Love the traces inside
Let them guide you out

How could you do this to us?
How could you make us suffer?

And now..

I'm burning inside,
But I don't blame you for the pain
I am still bleeding, and I am shattered
