Captured by a strange power
Forced to live alone
No longer able to choose what to do
And I try to sustain calm
Because the calmness is my survival

Am I gone forever, will I stay in here
No one around me, will nothing ever change

The bitterness is growing inside me
It's getting stronger for every day
I try not to hate
But the hate has become my survival

Am I gone forever, will I stay in here
No one around me, will nothing ever change

And now the memories fades away
The memories can't be taken away
You know I need a place to stay
I will be taken by you anyway
Now get inside these walls and pray
Get on your knees for me, you will pray
My mind needs a way

Am I gone forever, will I stay in here
No one around me, will nothing ever change
