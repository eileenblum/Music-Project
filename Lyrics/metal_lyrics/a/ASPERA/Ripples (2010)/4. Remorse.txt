Have you ever looked into the mirror
In faith of finding yourself
Have you ever made a promise
A promise you couldn't keep?

I regret and I'm sorry
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you
Help me find forgiveness

Are you sometimes frightened of tomorrow
Do you fear the truth?
Do you dare to stand up for your sins,
And feel the wounds deep within
Or are you afraid of the shame?

Rise from the fall try to capture what you've lost
Angels sings to restore your memory

You've got to rise from the fall, try to capture what you have lost
Angels sings to restore your memory, you are not alone
