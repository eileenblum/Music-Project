If I could see it,
Would I believe it?
I had no chance
But let you fade away
If I was blinded
And absent minded
My eyes just saw reflections

I see you
All so clear

Should foreseen it
Should have believed it
Now your gone and time can't heal
This pain I'm feeling
Wounds are bleeding
Everywhere I turn I see your face
