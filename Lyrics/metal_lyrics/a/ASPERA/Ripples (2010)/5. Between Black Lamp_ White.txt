There are so many paths in life, but only one to follow
And if you choose another course, you'll be banished, and cursed in sorrow
All my life I have been told that wherever I may go
I must never try to stand out - I am not as good as them

We fear our inner selves
Where did we go wrong?

Wake up, they're never gonna see
They go on, and on, and on
To the point where they can't control their inner selves
When the daylight turn to shades of grey
When the evening sun just fades away
In the deck of the night there is no colored light
Are we left with black and white

Sometimes I wonder if they'll always be the same
Will they ever open their eyes, or am I hoping in vain?
I have tried to understand the purpose of their ways,
But it made the color fade away

We fear our inner selves
Where did we go wrong?

Wake up, they're never gonna see
They go on, and on, and on
To the point where they can't control their inner selves
When the daylight turn to shades of grey
When the evening sun just fades away
In the deck of the night there is no colored light
Are we left with black and white

I see them coming with their heads soaked in blood
They will never be wiser,
If they don't turn their heads
They must try another way

I've been a victim of forsaken minds
I've been forced down on my knees
I've been trapped between the colors they see
And now I will break free

Wake up, they're never gonna see
They go on, and on, and on
To the point where they can't control their inner selves
When the daylight turn to shades of grey
When the evening sun just fades away
In the deck of the night there is no colored light
Are we left with black and white
