Today I saw the world, from a different view
The prospect of the future is now unclear
Today I saw the truth, the truth about tomorrow
all that I care for turned to rust
And now I don't know where to go

Have we lost, have we failed will we ever be able to act
Have we come to the point where we don't see the fact?

We plague our nature
We plague our mighty god above
There's no longer salvation
Are we willing to die for nothing
Ungrateful despite the blessings

Tomorrow we'll be confused
Rounded up in panic
Tomorrow we'll flee,
And you'll blame it on me
Can't you see?

We can't resist the temptations we face
In our wasted, shallow lives
And the sound of our misery will never fade out

So If we are the ones
Will we be given mercy for our actions
Or will we have a second chance
Stop the flame from burning out
Where do we go now
Is there nothing more for us to do
Will we find a better place
Or can we stop this fading flame

Have we lost, have we failed will we ever be able to act
Have we come to the point where we don't see the fact?

We plague our nature
We plague our mighty god above
There's no longer salvation
Are we willing to die for nothing
Ungrateful despite the blessings
