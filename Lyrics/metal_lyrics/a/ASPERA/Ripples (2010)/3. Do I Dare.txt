It cuts deep inside of me
'cause I thought we were meant to be
From the moment we met
The smile, the joy, the love all gone
In a second it went from right to wrong
It was meant to break
And it can not be replaced

Tell me why you left me,
I didn't even have the chance
To tell you what I felt for you
Before you let me go
I just need to know
What you're gonna say
It hurts so bad, so

Do I dare to walk again
After all that we've been through
Do I dare to dream about the smile
That made it all be so real

Painted in blood, cuts in my chest
Heart broken misery, wound up, stressed
Never to be changed
Answer my prays before I burn
Day after day I hope for return
Left in the cold

Do I dare to walk again
After all that we've been through
Do I dare to dream about the smile
That made it all be so real

Tell me why you left me,
I didn't even have a chance
To tell you what I felt for you
Before you let me go
I just need to know
When are you gonna see
It hurts so bad, so

Do I dare to walk again
After all that we've been through
Do I dare to dream about the smile
That made it all be so real

Love me, feel me, help me take my pain away
Tell me, show me, do you have something to say
