Seeking my fate
Seeking my one creation
The sole salvation
I must unite with my enemies
Magnify the mission
Realize whats to face

Why does it feel so wrong
This is my direction, I hope
And if you tell me the truth
Tell me why won't I follow you?

All that I think is real,
I fight for it, lie for it
Chained by my prophecy;
The purpose of finding me

My journey ends, I ask myself
Is this my reincarnation?
My mistakes I neglect
And I'm forced to forget

Hurt by the ones who will set me free

All that I think is real,
I fight for it, lie for it
Chained by my prophecy;
The purpose of finding me

Only I know my horizon
I may hold the secrets of life
Did god create me, or did I create god?
