I can see the face of evil when I close my eyes
And I'm left with too much to change
The trace you left me makes me bleed again
I was an easy prey, so young, so vulnerable

In my dreams I crawl in human flesh
And to me you were an easy prey
My breath made you panic
And my voice created fear
And your screams, just made me smile

Treated as filth, drowned in pain
I'm left with an empty heart

Struggling for a life
Struggling for a future
It was never clear
It was to be torn apart
Her eyes won't shine anymore
All the joy is broken from the core

I felt so alone, so hurt
And I'll never forgive myself
Please give me a choice,
Please give me hope to survive

Struggling for a life
Struggling for a future
It was never clear
It was to be torn apart
Her eyes won't shine anymore
All the joy is broken from the core
