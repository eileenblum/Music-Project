As spirits wreath in winds, unseen,
and Darkness covets all,
It would be all too easy to assume
the truths not what it seems...
The truths just as you claim...
but isn't that just a lie...?

I swallowed shit, I took the knocks,
I played the games...
Shunned all the lies,
And took the pleasure with the pain...
and looking back i'd like to think I kept my dignity,
your eyes were gates to emerald waters,

they drowned me...
I should've walked away so long ago...
If only I'd of known...
It wouldn't hurt to just let go...

When I close my eyes,
I recall the days I used to bide...
waiting till the time was right,
to get you the fuck out of my life...
you wanted love? Or just a toy?
Either way you got it...

In a downward spiral, time elapsed,
Opportunities pissed away on tap,
I remained too blind too see...
Unashamed to say I cried sometimes,
just thinking what could have been,
but those tears fell selfishly...

Close your legs, just this once,
You could swallow the sun with that thing...

âGod and Goddess I Ask Of Thee,
To Show This Person The Troubles They Have Caused,
And Make It Come Back Times Three...â
