(Feverishly...)
The time flew by,
in a haze of smoke and jaded reflections,
snow came and went, rain fell, sun shone,
though life felt sheltered,
time had gone...

I try my best to forget,
I try my best to move on,
no time to waste just holding onto things that have gone...

I try my best to forget...
I try my best to block it out,
Though things I leave behind,
Just haunt me more and more...

what can we do?
(We're only human after all...)

Isn't it a shame,
things won't ever be the same...?
Isn't it a shame,
things won't ever be the same...?

I try my best to forget,
(The things that came and went)
Yet my mind lingers on the things
(I miss more than anything...)

I try my best to forget...
(Those lost just years before...)
Those things I leave behind...
(Just haunt me more and more...)

I cannot find what isn't there...

[Solo]

I try my best to forget,
I try my best to move on,
no point in holding onto things...

I try my best to forget... the things I leave behind...
