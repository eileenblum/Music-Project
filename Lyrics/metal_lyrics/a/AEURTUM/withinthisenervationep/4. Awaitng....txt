What is life?
Sand in the hourglass...
What is life?

Enigma,
such an enigma,
just how do I break this code...

Into the mind,
where nothing is numbed,
no sense dumbed,
absolute in being,
and forever bound to be...

Out of control,
and into the throws of the ravaging tides,
Out of the mould,
and into the throws of the ravaging tides,
Out of your hold...

As time elapsed,
I came to be,
and thats where I stand,
not mere man,
not god nor beast,
just a being,
a shadow of life,
dust in the sunlight waiting to land,
and disappear gone for ever...
Thats all we are,
just dust,
no trace, no stain,
when the breeze comes we move again...
for eternity...
