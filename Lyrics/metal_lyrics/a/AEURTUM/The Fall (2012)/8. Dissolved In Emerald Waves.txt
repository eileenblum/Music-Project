As spirits wreathe in winds unseen,
and darkness covets all,
it would be all to easy,
to assume...

The truths not what it seems,
the truths just as you claim
but isn't that just a lie?

I swallowed shit I took the knocks I played the games,
Shunned all the lies and took the pleasure with the pain,
and looking back I'd like to think I kept some dignity,
your eyes were gates to emerald waters...

They drowned me!
I should've walked away so long ago...
If only I'd of known,
It wouldn't hurt to just let go...

As I close my eyes I recall the days I used to bide,
waiting till the time was right to get you the fuck our of my life,
You wanted love?
Or just a toy?
Either way you got it...

In a downward spiral time elapsed,
opportunities pissed away on tap,
I remained too blind to see...
unashamed to say I cried sometimes,
just thinking what could have been,
but those tears fell selfishly...

Close your legs,
just this once...
you could swallow the sun with that thing...

God and Goddess,
I ask of thee,
Please show this person the troubles they have caused...
and make them come back,
Times three,

and make them come back... times three

What's left when all is lost?
