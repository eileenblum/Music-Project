And so... the light inside us fade,
mute... in the aether...
Stone on stone...
weighing us down...

what god would want this for us? x2

I don't believe... in life or death...
one thing that i'm sure of...
is when we break that's all...

Tell me you'll make a difference,
It's something I'd kill to see...
there's nothing we can do to make us worthwhile...
we, a lucky mistake, should be thankful for the time...

What god would want this for us? X2

What is life? What is life after all?
Enigma... Such an enigma...
How do I break this code?

Estimate the purpose, the meaning of our life,
Calculate the cause, or discount us by all means...
fortify our faith in self to diminish pointless lives,
or reduce our will to cinders and undo us at the seams...

Remember this:
If he is up there, watching all we do...
each thing that we have crushed...
For ruining this place, on which we live,
what must he think of us?

...And so... It begins
