A distance that will break me,
exhausted by the climb,
growing weaker, with each and every step I take...
through the ashen woodland,
the heart of which calls to me...
like the sun, to the sea...

Through darkened skies, illuminated
Light of the hate in me...
Crumbling edges of reason...
Incinerated...
Every breath is so stale and wasted,
stealing the air we breathe now...
Feeding on lies so isolated,
on your own, so alone...

Uttering every name I hate...
as I curse the heavens, I swear to god you'll fear me...

As it rains on me...
nothing can still the flames of rage,
that suffocate...
Wrought by the bitter winds,
no silence can fulfil...

Through darkened skies, illuminated
Light of the hate in me...
Crumbling edges of reason...
Incinerated...
Every breath is so stale and wasted,
stealing the air we breathe now...
Feeding on lies so isolated,
on your own, so alone...

Uttering every name I hate...
as I curse the heavens, I swear to god you'll fear me...
I swear to god you'll fear me...
And you'll love it...
