Within the walls,
echoing out my solitude...
another day gone past,
and lower I sink into despair...

The smoke billows from my mouth,
nothing left to blow it out,
eyes ache from the lack of sleep,
the walls are burrowed deep from where I stare,

In equilibrium with myself,
everything has to end,
yet one sides gaining strength,
gaining strength over the real me...

Rifle through the tomes of self,
in search for a reason why,
this tale of mine turned sour,
amongst the trees that wreath and sigh,
I wait patiently...
I wait patiently...

In equilibrium with myself,
everything has to end,
yet one sides gaining strength,
gaining strength over the real me...

I need parity x8

It has to end,
It has to end soon...
This pain will kill us if I don't...
