This tragedy failed to reach an end,
a bitter promise becomes a bitter lie...
and as emotions once harboured turn to ash,
everything I knew wilts lest we say goodbye...

As hollow as I am,
I pride myself,
on my incapacity,
of being as twisted as you...

As a sun so bright shines down,
the pain grows sharper...
Euphoric waves engulf,
deliverance will never come...

As though nothing ever was,
anticipating the end of time...
the bowels of hell cry out our names,
in blissful harmony...

With wings of gold fresh spun,
that grace the sky blocking the sun...
What is so beautiful shan't rot,
as such is mortal love...
With wings of leaden black,
and sulphur burning through each deathly breath...
what was once beautiful has rot,
so much for mortal love...

as a sun so bright shines down,
the pain subsides...
allowing us to relish the beauty of life,
for one last time...

when will this bullshit ever end?
See you in hell my once loved friend...

I fucking gave you my all!
