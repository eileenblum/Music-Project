As hell froze over...
every hope I held went up in flames,
stood rigid, in the midst of self loathing agony...

Over and over,
I hear the words they used to say,
Knife in my back,
into the silence, as everything,
Decays...

What was so beautiful about it all?
When there's nothing,
but blood... in the snow behind...
As winds carry the scent of rain,
leaves wilt, in shame... at what was I...

And silence wept one more time in vain...
wept one more time in vain...

There's nothing sadistic, about what I've become...
just a shell of a man...
In the shadows formed...

What was so beautiful about it all?
When there's nothing,
but blood... in the snow behind...
As winds carry the scent of rain,
leaves wilt, in shame... at what was I...

When this is over...
and the blackened heart of mine is numb,
everything shall fall into place...
once more...

What was so beautiful about it all,
when there's nothing... but blood, in the snow behind...?
As wings bring the hand of death...
the earth, will swallow us whole...

And silence wept one more time in vain...
wept one more time in vain...
The silence wept one more time in vain...
wept one more time in...
