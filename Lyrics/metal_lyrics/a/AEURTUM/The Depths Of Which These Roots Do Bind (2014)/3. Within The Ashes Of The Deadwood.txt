With the weight of the world on my shoulders,
how shall I progress?
As the pain shall run through me...
In Solitude,
the skies are toiling,
Oh, I cannot wait for them to fall,
and bring that blackened rain...

And now, the storms that roar,
upon these rocky shores,
rip forth from this, our watery womb,
though destitute of being...
We are condemned;
to walk this earth, alone...
We are condemned;
to hating everything...

Dragging the deadwood,
behind me... (behind me)
It's time to cut the ropes...

Ah... With the weight of the world on my shoulders,
how shall I progress?
As the pain shall run through me...
In Solitude,
the skies are falling,
To bring that blackened rain...
Forth upon the world...

How shall I progress?
As the pain shall run through me...
In Solitude,
the skies are falling,
To pour that blackened rain...

Within... the ashes... of the deadwood...
the gems that I found,
were not worth their weight in lies...

Within... the ashes... of the deadwood...
the gems that I found,
Cast away, now belong to someone else...

...and so it goes...
...and so the embers die...
