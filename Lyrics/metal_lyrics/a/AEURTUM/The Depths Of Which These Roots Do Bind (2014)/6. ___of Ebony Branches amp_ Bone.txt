Noctilucent, through the leaves and branches I climbed...
To see the vistas before me...
In the shadows... of the summer night sky...
Praying for autumn to take me...
As I wait, in the sunset...

Awaken, from thine elegant slumber...
and weave with me a story...
of woe... of ebony branches and bone...
Where we both shall meet again...
In time...

As the silence sings it's song,
and the world turns evermore...
in the winds of time,
we shall be together...
Though reality and I...
dance the danse macabre...
What little threads of fantasy,
will hold this tapestry...
Together...
Like never before...
Together...
We shall live no more...

Noctilucent, through the leaves and branches I climbed...
To see the vistas behind me...
In the shadows... of the autumn dawn...
Praying for winter to take me...
Down...
