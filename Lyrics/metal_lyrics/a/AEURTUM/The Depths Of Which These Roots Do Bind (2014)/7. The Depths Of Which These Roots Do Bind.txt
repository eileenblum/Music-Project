A barren heart,
Grown through decay,
What fervour is wrought out?
Thrown to the tide...

I lay myself down,
Reflect, on all my sins,
That I've done in this life,
Or the ones yet, to commit...

I buried myself to find,
The depths of which these roots do bind...
Streams above, and dirt below,
The dark shall now entwine me...

From the edges,
of this bitter fall...
down the same old paths as before,
following the call...

I buried myself to find,
The depths of which these roots do bind...
My wings burn...
As I fly far too close to the sun...

And now...
one more time I try,
To salvage this wreckage...
before the embers,
turn to flame...

These roots go deeper than anything engrained,
the misery of memories that haunt me...
and the pain they bring...

Overshadows any joy...
Overshadows the brief light that shines...
Overshadows my loss...
Overshadows all other pain in my life...

I clawed the earth deep enough,
and I found hell...
