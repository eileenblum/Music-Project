Wings... come to carry me away...
From this home of my despair...
In the shade of a behemoth...
I hide...
I hide...

Feeling so low,
In my eyes you would never see the loss...
Oh the sun, burns so brightly...
I can see...

Wings... come to carry me away...
From this home of my despair...
In the shade of a behemoth...
I hide...
from this life...

Wings... Come to carry me away...
From this... world...

Wings... come to carry me away...
From this home of my despair...
In the shade of a behemoth...
I hide...
from this life...
