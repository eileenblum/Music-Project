Oh, the rain defies the amber sunshine...
And the bitter wind returns...
before time stood a chance,
Frozen in the grain...
Those embers finally died...
Leaving me alone again...

Those I have left behind me,
Shall haunt my memories...
but I shall walk alone,
on this downward spiral...
The leaves that wilt around me...
shalt mock my futility...
as hopeless as I was,
to stand, at the end...

And I will walk... alone,
holding onto this burden...
waiting for nothing to change,
except the same again...
and to and fro,
we take our chances,
at life, but never know,
the misery that awaits us once again,
that we know all too well...

Again, the tide begins to turn,
and the waves are far between...
The sea breeze turns to frost...
Frozen in the grain...
The sands beneath have shifted,
unveiling hell below...
That frost that fell, and froze my heart,
has turned to wintery snow...

And I will walk... alone,
holding onto this burden...
waiting for nothing to change,
except the same again...
and to and fro,
we take our chances,
at life, but never know,
the misery that awaits us once again,
that we know all too well...

...And once,
The sun has set the final time...
the footsteps in the sand shall wash away...
and everything that's happened in the past..
will drift away...
leaving nothing but pure unchanged grains...

...But I remember...
