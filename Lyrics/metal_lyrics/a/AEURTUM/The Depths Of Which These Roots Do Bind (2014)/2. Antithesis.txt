Return,
To the place that you call home...
Your sanctuary...
That place that keeps you safe,
when the hardships of life,
are just too much for you to take...

When you are all alone...
When you are feeling cold...
Remember: You are the only one...

Those memories shall come in waves...
of pain again...

The fire burns
forever more...
consuming all...
and rendering it, to ash...
(the wind shall blow away...)
Eternity, it seems,
will still for me...
to relish each and every lick,
of miseries roaring flames...

The Antithesis of life...
And the will to survive...
The Antithesis of life...
And the will to survive...

And the leaves come falling down...

Return...
To the place that you call hell...
That place where only...
you can find solace in...
you can find peace...
On your own...
With no-one to confide in...

When the hardships of life,
are just too much for you to take...
Remember...
The antithesis of life...
And the will to survive...

And the leaves come falling down...
