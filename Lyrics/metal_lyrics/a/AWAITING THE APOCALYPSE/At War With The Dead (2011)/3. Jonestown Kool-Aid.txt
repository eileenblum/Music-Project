This world is rotten
Mankind is consumed by his greed
We can become equal
And build a society that is free
I will lead you through the darkness
Through the jungles of Guyana
We will build Utopia
Led by the light of GOD...
This is our only solution
I'm not the one that's failed you, now
The world has let you down
I tried my best to give you a good life
We have been horribly betrayed
We're not committing suicide
This is a revolutionary... ACT!!!
The children shall die first
Because they can not choose
Force down the cyanide
Or, CHOKE OUT THEIR FUCKING LIFE
Consumption, Suffocation, Injection, Execution
909 had died from this murder/suicide
They were forced, to take their own lives
Their own lives
Utopia has been denied
You won't die alone
We thought we could change this world
We were wrong
This world holds nothing for us any longer
No reason for us to stay alive, any longer
