FUCK!
This is the end of the World!
We're all going to die
When it all comes crashing down
And fire rains from the sky
The Bodies pile up
Humanity is out of luck
This is everything that I hoped and wished this would be
Slaughter engulfs the masses, chaos spreads from sea to sea
Blood will spill on every corner of the earth
Humanity will be held for what it's worth
This is not in your control
That which can not be controlled
Plague, famine, war, and death
are the curses we shall get
Disease, hunger, you must fend off
'Til the world has see the end of
The human race
Destroying this place
And what should we tell our grand kids,
If we ever manage to survive this
Plague, famine, war, and death
Are the curses we shall get
Disease, hunger, you must fend off
'Til this world has see the end of
The human race
Destroying this place
