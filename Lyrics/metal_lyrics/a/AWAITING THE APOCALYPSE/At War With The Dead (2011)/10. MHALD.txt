We take this journey, this road now so familiar
We've driven it 100 time, we'll do it 1000 more
Every turn and curve, I know better than myself
This is our lives; this is who we are....
Everything is changing, is it for better or worse?
The plants are growing, buds will blossom then burn
4, 5, or 6, or your best shit,
Wrap it up, I'll flip it and see you in 10 days
See you in 10 days
That's when you'll get paid
The sweat builds on your palms
This venture is dark and long
Filled with danger and with bomb
The miles roll on and on
Lights flash red and blue
They're coming after you
There's nothing left to do
Pull the car over and face the truth
It's over, they've got me, I think as I am stopping
They'll take me far away, lock me into solitary
It's over, they've got me, I think as I am stopping
They drove by and my heart sighed, I thought
I was gonna die
We make this, we take this
A journey into the heartland
Fuck no, they won't get me
I will always get off scot-free
Until the day they take from me
What is most precious, being free
And if that happens I'll rip out your fucking throat
