We thought we were prepared for
Anything to come our way
The powers that control our fate
Put their efforts to technology
How fucking stupid could they be
LaDa LaDa LaDa LaDa
How fucking stupid could they be.....
Lead them through the choke point was the only good idea
We should be on rooftops, not under concealment
Zack gives a shit less about our fucking cover
Artillery and tanks so USE-LESS
Rifle shakes in hands, approach the FRONT LINE
Set sights on my mark, exhale, BRAINS FLY
Fire in the sky followed by STEEL RAIN
THEY SURVIVED, NOW WE DIE
This is use-less
A waste of weapons
One way to die
Head shots kill, destroy the brain
1 in 3 expected to fire
1 in 10 expected to kill
We should have been more prepared
My saw-gun roars "Die"
Mother-Fucker
DIE
They pour in my the thousands
Then by the millions
Over-whelmed by numbers
Now join the ranks of the DEAD
This is use-less
A waste of weapons
One way to die
Head shots kill, destroy the brain
