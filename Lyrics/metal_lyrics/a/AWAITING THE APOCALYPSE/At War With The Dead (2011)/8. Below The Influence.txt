Oh my god, weâre at it again
Drinking our memories BLACK
Just to let you know
Trees on sticks should be FREE
DO NOT DESPAIR
This is a celebration
A time for indulgence
Abandon all inhibitions
And prepare for intoxication
Fill you pint glass up
Paper or a plastic cup
Raise your drink to the sky
Forever we will forget these times
Drank my memories black
Whatâs left? Look back and laugh
To a time not long ago
YOU BURIED MY CAR IN SNOW
Guts drank raisin dry
Happy hour Tuesday nights
Blur falls over eyes
Lose grip on reality
Rush to a toilet to vomit again
Feed intoxication like fuel into a fire
Face meet porcelain, as my sight begins to spin
After 20 shots in feel my liver giving in
Losing this battle, it will never win
LDC will never say no
To a black tooth grin
We will die legends
With a bottle and a .45
LDC, âtil the day I die
