RESURRECTED, I WILL FEAST ON YOU
You can try to run and hide
Feeble attempts not to die
The smell of your living flesh
Fuels my hunger, There's no other
Thought that runs through my mind
All feeling has been left behind
Body begins to decay
Rigor mortis will not stop this
I, need to feed
You, need to bleed
Pain, will subdue
As I sink my teeth into you
Walking corpses chew on children
Screams and moans deafen all sounds
The smell of decayed bodies fills the air
As the dead rise from the ground
The Dead, Rise Up, They're Go, ing To Consume You
Escape is futile, out-numbered 1000 to 1
Your only chance is to fight back
Smash the brains of everyone
Escape is futile, your enemy feels no pain
Your only chance is to fight back
Napalm incineration
CHAOS is everywhere, streets lined with bodies, gutters filled with blood
THE BATTLE will ensure, no victor shall remain
THE BEST once could hope for, is merely to survive
They're clawing
The skin ripped from their finger-tips
Straight bone provides a better grip
They're tarring
The meat off of my ligaments
The taste of me, gives them bliss
They're rising, from the earth
They're rising, TO FEAST ON THE FLESH OF THE LIVING
THEY RISE
TO FEAST ON FLESH OF THE LIVING
