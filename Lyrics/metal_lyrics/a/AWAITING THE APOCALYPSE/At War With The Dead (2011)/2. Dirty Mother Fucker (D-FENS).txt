Clear a path mother-fucker
I'm coming home
Stay the fuck out of my way
Or you will suffer and pay
I'm take back prices to 1965
How much for these batteries?
Wrong answer
In fact I think that this whole,
God damn shelf is suspect
I'll give you 50 cents for this coke so I have change
To make a phone call, I'm going home
Is this some gangland bullshit?
Keep me the fuck out of it
Letâs get this mother-fucker
Letâs get this piche.. puta
Two minutes past 11:30, why can I have breakfast?
If I pull a gun out would you listen to me, 'cause this is pathetic
Look at the delicious burger on the menu, mine doesn't look like this
We've been through so much together, let's use our first names
This is everything to me
Give me a rocket launcher
I'll blow some shit up
