If I could measure love in punches I would beat you to death just to prove my love to you
'Cause you are always there
And you're the only one I care for
Alone, I am not anymore
At home, how I feel when I'm with you
Safe, I am, in your gentle hands
You are the light, when times are so dark that I am blind
You make me see, what's been buried underneath
This mask, I hide my true identity
I wanna spend eternity, by your side
And there's only one way to make you mine
In the afterlife we will reside
I will beat you to death just to prove my love to you
I will dedicate every essence of this being
To fulfilling your every want and need
These are my vows to you
I will not abuse you trust, I will prove that I
Am worth every moment of time
Forever, we will spend our lives
This is a sacrament to my
Commitment
(if) You break my heart, I'll break your face
We will never grow old as our spirit will mold into one
We will float to our eternal refuge
I will take your life
And my life
I will take your life
Tonight
