I see that smile
Special with special needs
No worries
Taken care of
Will follow I will lead
Tied down
My pilers
Tighten on enamel
Breaking teeth
Chubby fingers
Snapping bones
Retarded screams
Rusty blade
Cutting flesh
Through the knees
Lower missing limbs
Blow torch,punish the retarded for living simple lives
Rage of working
Take it out on innocence
Torturing for screams fun gory greed
Special no more
Just slabs of meat
Taking it out on innocence.
