I can't stop this obsession
My skin will be set free
Skin the face for relief
Skin the face anxiety calms
I don't need to see my shrink
An iron is not just for clothes anymore
Cartarize the blood vessels
All the glorious pain pain pain
Skin the face
For relief
Skin the face
For relief
Skin the face
For relief skin the face
For relief
The pain is so horendous
Nerve endings
Fully exposed
Look at my beauty
A skinless Adonis
Skull and cartiage
Sticky and moist,the pain subsides and so does the enjoyment
Skin the face
For relief
Skin the face
For relief
Skin the face
For relief
Skin the face
For relief
