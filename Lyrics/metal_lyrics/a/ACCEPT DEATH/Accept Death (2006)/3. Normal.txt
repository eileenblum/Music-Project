You say you want me to feel your inside
I want to but not the way you think
Enjoying wet kinky things
My psyche begins to sink. wanting more and more exquisite tastes
Depravity for depravity sake. mind alive with thoughts of red
Tired of hiding and being fake
Urges become more intense
I need to get my release
Just one time will safice
Troolint for my next feast
Young fresh nebile sights
Filling my veins with pressure my
My mind fills with raging violence
My disease has no cure
Younger the better
Not stricken with filth
Supple creamy thighs
Not much longer on earth
Leave you won't fucking leave
I'll smash your fucking face in
You piece of shit
Your mommy can't help you now
Fuck I did it again
What the fuck is wrong with me. why can't I be normal.
