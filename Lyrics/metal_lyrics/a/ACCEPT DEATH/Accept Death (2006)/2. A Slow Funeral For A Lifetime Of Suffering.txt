Waking in pain everyday
Nothing of your former self
Brittle and weak
You pray for an end
To the year and years of suffering
Finally the pain is at an end
Its time to die
Lay down in the dirt forever
You've dreamed of this your whole life
It is what you've always wanted
To be a corpus in a hole
Your own dark hole
You wanted silence
Now you have it
The earth is warm and welcoming
It spreads it's legsfor you
Insert yourself into the grave
Its wet underground
You don't need to scream anymore
Everyone is glad that you are dead
You where a fucking loser
And now you are dead
Rot my friend forever
Rot forever.
