I seal Thee -inside of me- in utmost secrecy
so to ruin my fertile inner grounds with oil
approach me Lord, expand all over me and feed my starving mouth with Gehinnom soil

Come sleep Thou King (near the banks)
by the river of my tears
Grant me the transformative nectar of transgression
Allow me God to arise and prostrate my filthy human will
until I'm ashes...it is ashes

Divine Pyosis, harmful force
abominable womb, yet untouched source
where the rays of life do not reach
Egoless triumph, Black Sun's Dawn
the Spirit's Eclipse

I'm sealed by Thee to the utmost degree of humility
for you've blessed my sterile grounds-serpent coiled
Allow me Lord to sing for Thee
And feed my starving mouth with the stars of Nuit.

Crowned Antigenesis, hellish course
moist and putrid womb, key to death's doors
where Thine blaze enwines me in deserts bleak
Rise twelve-winged angel and force all living flee...
Divine Pyosis, harmful force
abominable womb, yet untouched source
where the rays of life do not reach
Egoless triumph, Black Sun Dawns
the Spirit's Eclipse
