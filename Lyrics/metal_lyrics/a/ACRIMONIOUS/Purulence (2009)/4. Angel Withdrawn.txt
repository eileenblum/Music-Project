Where voids open and the fathomless lurk
crawling like the spawn of celestial incest
an angelic death rattle rolls like thunder across earth
so foul is the sight, so pure is its essence
Open your soul, submit and withdraw
For (after all) of what use are those sinful limbs and mind?
And know the mystery of a hidden poison
that shall make man the murderer of god

The floodgate shall be opened by the sign of castrated will
and break those cursed knees for you'll never rise them again
Slither like a serpent forth over cadavers of heavenly hosts
Destroy and rebuild thyself and become but a brick for His Throne.

Where circles close and the faceless yearn
through chasms within to cleave the nucleus
For (after all) of what use are thine name and form
Each breath is a sin, and a mockery each heartbeat
For never again shall that crawling infant
(risen from divine ejaculation) walk the soil
The thunder breaks the ground, the pulse is dead
'The mountains shall sink and the depths ascend'

Now see the clouds open, by the sign of dethroned life
Tear out those cursed eyes, for you shall have no more use for sight
The poison breaks the floogates burying the cadaver of god
turn your face towards the faceless
open your soul, submit and withdraw.

Let us leave these fruitless lands and never to return
Let us murder all our offspring and let all bridges burn
Let us swallow the demon blood and be swallowed by the deeps
where the voids open (for all) and the fathomless feeds
