Odious reign, blessed reign
Thanatos
See his snakes poisoning your open
wounds of sinful essence
Perfection denied, thus open forever
Odious reign, blessed reign
Catharsis
Crawling as truth and in indiscreet
holy essence, holy presence
Rise in terror, mistreat and mislead
heal with torture
Satan
Quoniam mihi flectetur omne genu
et ominis lingua confitebitur Deo
creator, reformer of plagues
A rise, deforming progress
Cut the flesh, slice their wrists
and no blood shall be shed
but bloodlike tears of SHAME
Et adorabunt eum omnes qui inhabitant terram.
