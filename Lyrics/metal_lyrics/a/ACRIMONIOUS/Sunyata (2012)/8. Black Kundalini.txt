I praise my Self to rise from the highest Vessels
to the path of No Return...
and to the heavens of Anshargal
My kingdom of Flames at the quarters of Dominion...
And I prevail to speak my Hexes of No Return...
for I dwell in the oblivion of Serpent's Divinity
Behold, this is my Seventh Seal!

My tongues are fire to the souls of the living
and Apocalypsis of the Rivers of Immortality!

My cold lakes of metamorphosis, the parallel planes of Ninagal
Ninazu the voice of creation!

Black earth visions rise before my eyes,
All nightmares enfleshed!
as Ophis twin, the form of beauty itself!
For I cast my Seed in the fields of the Night
Genu ante nomine Vivarium,
quia ego Deus tuus.

Behold, this is the Land of No Return!

my void of bestial devastation
The Echoes of Dreams, of Art, and Draconian might!
From the Seven Places of creation
Drink thou from my webs...
exalt me in life
And from my fleshly tomb, my shadow
In thine Abyss shall rise!
