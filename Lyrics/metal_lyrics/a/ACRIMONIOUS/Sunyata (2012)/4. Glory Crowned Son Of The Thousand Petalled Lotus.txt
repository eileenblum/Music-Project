Lucifer!

A Contractional prison housed the torch of expansion
In the vast extensions of Sheol. A movement that detaches the mind from the Mind and the self from the Self. A shadow cast by the original Form, and filtered through the undifferentiated beams of Sunyata, stretches out to devour the undevoured. Lucitherionic pandaemonium encompassing the Shells in merciless judgement, uncontrolled fire and ever pillaging fury, cutting to pieces the 14 Osirian limbs of stasis with the Swords of Division.
The veins of the earth are pumping with the blood of redemption and the halos of the pleroma are burning with the rays of Shabbatai. 131 white spiralling snake bodied virgins are chanting the mantras of the Night of Time and the Womb of Lilith opens for Sorathâs triumph. Glorious Thine Fall O Father, the desert is watered with the blood of the Black Brothers.

Hail Thaumielâs Star, Hail Redeeming Wrath!
Hail, Solar King of Crimson Flame, the son behind the Sun- Untamed.
Hail Lucifer! I ascend to your blazing Heights unburned
An Icarus with Wings of Gold, grant me entrance to your Star âTwofold.
