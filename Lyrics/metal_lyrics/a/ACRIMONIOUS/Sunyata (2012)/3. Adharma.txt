Scorching rain of wrathful bane fertilise the earth
Emissaries of Golachab, wing forth upon Black Khem
Moistened stones are carved with seals of Lucifer Vasileus
Volcanic outbursts burn new paths into the Realms of the Intellect

Invoking Worms that prey upon the Sephirothic light
The furies cut the silver cords of Assiahâs destined flight
Karmas nilled, samsara weeps, red triangles of fire
Pregnant void, unspoiled Seed, the Hermitâs Will- a desire killed

Through Daleth absorbed by the Wings of Ayin
The Seed of Set is planted in
By the Roots of Caduceus I distill the juice
Mukti of an Inverted Zeus

Through Gimel murdered and left in the Waste
The Hollowers leave the Soul pure and chaste
For I was Cain and now I'm Not
I pass the Circle and the Dot
