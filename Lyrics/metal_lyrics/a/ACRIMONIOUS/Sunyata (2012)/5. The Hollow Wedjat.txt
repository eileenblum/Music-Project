I am the Word without the force of lungs
Without Lips and Breath and Cords and Tongue
Echo me unto Moriah's Mount
A Blade without hinders, a Dawn without a Sun

The edge of the West is as sharp as the East's
Yet I'm the Voice that know neither Heights or Deeps
Carry me unto Sinai's peaks
Knowledge beyond letter or divine speech

Who shall defy me, when Defiance am I?
And who to mute me, when the Silence is mine?
Seek me and seize me thou who speak without sound
The Judgement that no Law has found

Bare me unto Kurun HattÃ®n
A Topheth to pity, a Gehenna to sin
Blow me unto Golgotha's top

Where the fallen angel has risen up!
Removing the Aeons on his death-silent route
Ascending on the wings of Malak al-Maut
And reaching the summit of Meru the High
To unite the Void with both Earth and Sky

I am the Word without the force of Lungs
Without Lips and Breath and Cords and Tongue
The eye of the Hawk stares Hollow and Blind
And so Moves the Voice that no Thought can Bind!
