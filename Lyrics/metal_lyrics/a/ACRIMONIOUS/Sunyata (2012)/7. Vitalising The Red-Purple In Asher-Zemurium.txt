Into the night of golden death
Rock and spirit swiftly blend
They scream below the stars of woe
Absorbing kalas of the moon.

that shine forth from Gamaliel
unleashing spirits of the dead
that speak in unison Her Name
of She that no god ever tamed.

O Lilith, Thou primordial One
Vampyric Mistress- Crimson Star
the black wolves cry, thine venom stirs
the sleeping dragon in my streamsâ¦ of
werewolf blood and chthonic fire
that lights the path to your empire
where Naamah's daughters indulge in sins
and those that don't, dance Widdershins.

Spiders of purple, webs of entrapment
Caves of black topaz, spells of enchantment
Oh Astral transformation
I ride the winds of night, transformed in
 Malformationsâ¦

I call Thou forth Vrykolakas
Gorgo, Mormo appear in trance
Veni, veni Empusa
ÎÎ±ÏÏÎ¿ Î§Î¬Î¿Ï Î¦Î­ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ±
I call Thou forth Great Queen of Night
Come dance on graves of Crimson Light
The inverted cup is filled with
The elixir of Characith

The twofold crescent Seal now glows
the vision of the Queen unfolds
Ajna's burning glory quench'd
embrace me now for I am blessed

Into the mouths of those She chose
Amrita from Her Yoni flows
to bless their Holy Khu with marks
of Shekinah, that's trapped in husks.
