At the end of this path I have reached to the crossroads
where no light ever shines save from that of the moon
that glows red from the blood of the Succubus' opfers
and extends to this earth in malicious gloom

Two Silver torches illuminate the face of my Lady
pale and solemn, Tartarus moves in Her wake
I have come to the end of this world but to serve Thee
and to offer Thee wine, in Your feasts to partake

Mother, Saviour, Three-faced Goddess in your darkest phase
grant us the infernal powers as we meet your gaze
Serpent-haired force of night who turns to stone all men
that dare to glance Thy countenance without the eyes of Cain
For my heart is made of stone and yields upon my Sight
the hardness of the diamond the frost of Ophis might
Queen Hecate, Seal of Nox, Womb of Eosforos
Liminal the states you bring defying the Zone of Choros.

Hum! Crimson robes and a halo of holiness dress Thee
Jai! Seated upon throne of rock, where snakes ever crawl
Zodacare I chant stimulating the gateways of Anubis
to pierce through the green halls where mysteries Call.

Sandalwood anoints me into this feast of Ur
Etheric calls whisper to draw down the moon
The leap of the frog is the leap of the Worlds
Timespace is bending, Yetzirah tolls.

My prana is feeding the sigils of Her
and opens the gateways of chtonic black earth
The path of the Wolf is the path of the Owl
and blessed is he who has risen to fallâ¦

To fall in the tombs that Her vulva unveils
thoughtless and boundless the light that man kills
and slains all that hinders the rise in denial
the most perfect image of Adam-Belial

Rejoicing we die in our Mother's Abyss
And we know that the only light lies through Iblis
But even Iblis shall now fall down to pray
For the rays of Enodia banish the Way
of solar identity,...
into the waters of Nidhogg, vanish it may.
