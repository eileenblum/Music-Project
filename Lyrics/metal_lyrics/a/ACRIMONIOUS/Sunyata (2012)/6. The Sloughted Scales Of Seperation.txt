How did it come to pass
That Thine call met my ear?
A roar shot forth before the dawn of Time
Piercing the veils once spun
in the war between hope and fear
When stars where fixed and Nothingness defined

But within the grisly cavern, that horrid blackened tomb
Buried was the word unuttered, Sophia's fallen stone
Encircled by the Viper, who's secret is but its dread
For its venom is the elixir and the diamond is its egg

O terrible glamour! O alluring devilish fruit!
That has grown from the tree, which crown is its root
And sprung from Thine holy body, and watered by Thine holy blood
That we all might become as foolish as the gods

How did it come to pass
That the moon rose from the Sea?
And Death dressed itself as a beauteous bride
Who is paradox perfected
Curled in the greatest of mystery
As She's born into that which She defies

So I set to search upon the wildest of all trails
The old serpent's back, that leads to the Abysmal grail
Yet the riddle was cast between the without and the within
For where does the tail end and the hungering fangs begin?

Thine twisted shape bewilders, in constant flux and swirls
And the endlessness of the ocean conceal an unseen pearl
That shall engulf the seeker, like the moth within the flame
For the caller and the called was all but the same
