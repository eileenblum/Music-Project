Alone on the ancient mountaintop
Stood the one who had lost his way
For when you walk on the path of a traitor
You will find you may soon be betrayed
Stray not from the path you've chosen
You may yet find what you seek
You will learn to command the ethereal realm
And fulfill your destiny

Cast out of his land for reaching for that which lies out of mortal sight
Like a beast he is feared and hunted
Like a beast he intends to fight
Stay true to your heart young warrior
Keep your sword close by your side
And when night comes again beware what the darkness hides

Go now to the realm of spirits child
You are running out of time
Seek quickly the one who will guide you
Who will teach you the way of light
Doubt not your resolve young wanderer
May your stride be swift and true
For the colors of day are fading away
And tonight they will come for you

No amount of work or training
Can prepare you for the changing winds
But don't despair my child
You must fight
Take hold of strength divine
Shape the world to your design
And release the power you keep inside your heart

I am the light when a life's at its end
The still burning candle when darkness descends
I am desire, warmth from the fire
fueling your steps when your journey began

I am the fear twisting tight round your throat
The life giving spark hiding deep in your soul
I am your aura, hunger for honor
I hold the power you seek

Eeeeyuh

A fire arose behind his eyes
The trees, like torches, blazed up in the night
The fire raced across the sky
The trees like torches
Like torches blazed with light

And now they're on the run
No mercy smite them one by one
You've got an axe to grind
Relentless, no one left behind
Immolation is their fate
Hunt them down and let them feel your hate
No cowards left alive
By your power they will die
And now they're on the run
No mercy smite them one by one
You've got an axe to grind

For the fire of your soul
Is a terror to behold

No amount of work or training
Can prepare them for their flaming end
But don't hold back my child
They must die
Take hold of strength divine
Shape the world to your design
And release the power you keep inside your heart
