"Hey momma!"
"Can't you see I'm fuckin' cookin'?!"

It wasn't right for me but I knew it was time for home
And it was half past ten but all the lights were on
Did you read his face as blank as it was
Well mother would sit him down as strictly where he was

And he said:
All my friends, are bloating and floating away

I left all my friends back around the bend
The water turned to black as the night rolled on in
I couldn't hear a sound as I slowly turned around
There I saw my friends all god damn face down

And he said:
All my friends, are bloating and floating away

And I walk on down, I don't feel the pain
And I'll raise my eyes
Won't you let me raise my eyes?
Momma let me raise my eyes?
Won't you let me raise my eyes again?

All my friends, are bloated and floating away.
