This life spreads like cancer
As nothing here is real
Leave me here by the bus stop
With my pencil made of steel
So it's time
It's just time

Well I'm not much for the classroom
Teacher teach me if you care
I can't pay much attention with that ruler in your hand
So it's time,
'Cause I'm thinking, pencil fight, here we are
Pencil fight, break me down

It's just time
It's just time

I'm not much for the school yard
Teacher catch me if you can
Leave me here by the swing set with my pencil broke in hand
Oh it's fine

Shattered shards of graphite as they're flying through the air
I'll open eyes quite slowly with the splinters in my hair

So it's time
So it's time
'Cause I'm thinking, pencil fight, break me down
Pencil fight, break me down

It's just time
Oh my, oh my

"In this world no one leaves alone
For the only way we leave is in death
And in death my friends ya leave with one thing
And that one thing is pride
And pride throughout changes in time
Between the sky that you love to the ground that you hate.
Pride between everything that once was your pride,
Can never die."

Pencil fight, here we are
Pencil fight, break me down

Don't you see we have problems here? Problems here at my home
