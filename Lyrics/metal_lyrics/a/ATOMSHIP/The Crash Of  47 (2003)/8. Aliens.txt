I am the alien
Sitting on my front porch step
Whittling without a care
Sitting in this rocking chair

I believe
Alien
I am the alien

We are the aliens
Standing here with our hands down
Whittling without a care
Sitting by this rocking chair

We are the aliens

Sitting and waiting and waiting and watching and watching and waiting cause I am the alien
Wishing and hoping and hoping and praying and praying and hoping that we are the aliens
Hold me down to the floor
Chains and whips you wish for more
Hold me down to the floor
'Cause we are the aliens
