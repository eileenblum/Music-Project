I found no people for killing time
So I found time for killing people
I found no rhythm I would rhyme
So I'm the rhythm for the people

And if you wait on me
I'll be free one day
And if you wait on me
I'll be free one day

Contemplating genocide
Upstairs waving, scared of people
Afraid that feeling hasn't died
It gets lonely for my people
And if you wait on me
I'll be free one day
And if you wait on me
I'll be free one day
And if you wait on me
I'll be free one day
And if you wait on me
I'll be free one day

People always drifting out of pain
They cannot hold onto nothingness
Fingers bleed on the concrete walls
leaving only one nail for someone to see
Only one nail screaming to me
so many fingers pointing at me
so many fingers pointing at me
so many fingers pointing at me

I found no people for killing time
so I found time for killing people
I found no people for killing time
so I found time for killing people
Killing people, killing people, killing people
