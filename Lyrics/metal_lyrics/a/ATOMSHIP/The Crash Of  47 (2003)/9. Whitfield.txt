Whole, wide, world

There's a man outside and he's screaming that the elephants are trampling
Trampling his father in his sleep
There's a girl outside and she's screaming that the world's on fire
On fire today

There's a man inside and he's screaming for his noon time pills
At nine a.m.
There's a girl outside who's screaming at the whole wide world
One hair at a time

I'm trying so hard to keep my eyes still
Against the whole wide world
To make her love me
Whitfield was my world today
Love me
Against the whole wide world, cause she won't love me
Whitfield was my world

There's a man inside and he's screaming that his father
Was never there
There's a girl outside who's screaming at the whole wide world
One day out of time
There's a boy inside and he's holding a picture gun
To his head
There's a girl outside who's screaming that the world's on fire
on fire today

I'm trying so hard to keep my eyes still
Against the whole wide world, to make her love me
Whitfield was my world
Whole, wide, world, wide, world, wide, world, wide! [x3]

Against the whole wide world, to make her love me
Whitfield was my world today
Love me
Against the whole wide world, cause she won't love me
Whitfield was my world

The world's on fire...
