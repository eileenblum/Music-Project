Proven in theory your heart can be lost by the brain
Staring hard forward the devils just out of frame
Mother where are you I loved you I'm right here
Twisting and turning and loving and breading your hair

It was a good day
She died
It was a good day to die and run from the night
It was a good day to die
She died

Help me I'm wasting my heart has been lost by the brain
Covered in ashes and dust might just pump through your veins
Father where are you I thought you were my friend
Well I'll be your mother your Mary your Jesus and Zen

It was a good day
She died
It was a good day to die and run from the night
It was a good day to die
She died

With her head this close to the floor
I feel so alive!

She died
It was a good day to die and run from the night
It was a good day to die
She let me die old
She died
Just let me die old
She died
