Driving round in your car
The thoughts are piled up very, very far
Didn't know the time
Did happen to read the last three mile moccasins
A bright flash of light flashed before my eyes
Along with the centipedes, the birds and the dragonfly

But did you know
I loved you more than I could ever show
And did you know
There's something deep inside you that would fail to grow
And did you see that
Sometimes I'm beside of me
And did you know
The tales of the dragonfly?

Driving round in my car
I look up just the time to see I've gone too far
And while I will
You're not here come back where you're supposed to be
I miss you hair, my yelling to the passing man beneath your stairs
He stares at me, well, see while he wants to decide

But did you know
I loved you more than I could ever show
And did you know
There's something deep inside you that would fail to grow

And did you see that
Sometime I'm beside of me
And did you know
The tales of the dragon?
oh my dragonfly

You'll come crashing down, bleeding me and holding me down
I think I like it
You'll come crashing down, bleeding me and holding me down
I think I like it

You'll come crashing down
You'll come crashing down!

But did you know
I loved you more than I could ever show
And did you know
There's something deep inside you that would fail to grow
And did you see that
Sometime I'm beside of me
And did you know
The tales of the dragonfly?

You're my dragonfly
