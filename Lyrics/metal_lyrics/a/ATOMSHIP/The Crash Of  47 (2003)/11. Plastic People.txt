Time entails the sun to hesitate, clinging on and off again
Picture all the children as they walk on by clean into the front yard
Falling in and out of sync with him in the ground, I see
Promises I have broken, shadows creep along the window

The window sill, drowned by the rain
Swallow the pill, it kills the pain

Freeze frame capture it
The stars fell from the sky
In my hands they pulsate
Into the night they're shattered on the front line
The devil knows where they hide
Into the ground he passes by
And the lineage dies
before I may get home

The window sill, drowned by the rain
Swallow the pill, it kills the pain

Plastic people, paint the skies
Plastic people, paper skies

In my hands they pulsate

The window sill, drowned by the rain
Swallow the pill, it kills the pain.

Plastic people, paint the skies
Plastic people, paper skies
