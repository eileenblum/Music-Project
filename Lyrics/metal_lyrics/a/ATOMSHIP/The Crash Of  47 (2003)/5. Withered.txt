Because it's two in the morning
And I'm feeling so ugly
I've got this chip on my shoulder
Keeps my eyes spread wide open

If you'd let me go.
Then I'd walk myself into the room, yes I will.
Then I'd lay right down and daydream of you, yes I will.
With this soul tell smile I'll blow a kiss to you, yes I will.
Then I'd lay right down and daydream of you.

It seems the sun is still sleeping
And I'm feeling so lonely
There's a girl in my bedroom
But don't you worry she's not breathing

If you'd let me go
Then I'd walk myself into the room, yes I will
Then I'd lay right down and daydream of you, yes I will
With this soul tell smile I'll blow a kiss to you, yes I will
Then I'd lay right down and daydream of you

And though your soul's been withered and wisped away
My grey matter brings me home
And though your soul's been withered and wisped away
Your grey matter brings you home

So I' walk myself into the room, yes I will
Then I'd lay right down and daydream of you, yes I will
With this soul tell smile I'll blow a kiss to you, yes I will
Then I'd lay right down and daydream of you

Because it's two in the morning and my eyes are spread wide open
