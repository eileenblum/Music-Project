[Music: Mathieu]

One day the sun seemed to fall
And the horizon came soaring
Clouds racing, ground heaving
Crumbles another kingdom
Engulfed where skies and sea collide
Hear the whistles turning to howls

Quicken your pace northward
As sea devours land
Billions swept away, envied by the living
In global mourning, suffering the unison
They cry at azure darkening day by day
Wilting breed of legends

Forsaken breed, Giants have fallen
Hitting stones together again
Vain calls for a lost light

Gathered for the Holocaust
They give lives away
For gods to embody again
Then from the abyss ascended

This now happens to you again
Under many disguises
The wombs yield offerings
As they did, as they will
Slavery will never cease

[Solos: Mat]
