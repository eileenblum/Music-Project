[Music: Patrick]

From the day my eyes first open
Voices inside started speaking
Lullabies like faded memories of an Eden in eternal spring
Where at will colors reappear, where creation blooms in rejoice
Dodging away its mourning mantle
In horizon ablaze, the sun shone
On those mourning themselves, slowly given back their senses
Given courage to hold on longer and a goal to breathe for

Desert traveler in a mirage welcome
Feeling a presence, yearning for fairy hands
To steer the dormant soul back to life again
Remote heaven, like an island by all lines bypassed
At times seen drifting in the horizon to disappear

[Solo: Pat]

A mere glimpse was enough to reopen the wound

The awakening comes
Sorrows held within all want out at once
All day sleepwalking, daydreaming over a memory
A star around which all thoughts revolve,
Worlds feeding on its light,
At times the dream comes to life, yet elusive remains

Stars fell from the skies, by this marvel overthrown
At last breathed life in; from mire, raised
Reality comes soiling illusions
With its clouds the skies darken

Flogged by the wind, howling heavenward
To keep away storms marching in
On the march of time, so winter won't come again

Then the sleepwalking resumes, while the anima sleeps
Chews its way to the core, worming within the domain of dreams
Beckoning refuge, until the worm wiggles in its sleep
In lust for this life again, this constant cycle of hopes and despairs

[Solo: Mat, Pat, Mat &amp; Pat]
