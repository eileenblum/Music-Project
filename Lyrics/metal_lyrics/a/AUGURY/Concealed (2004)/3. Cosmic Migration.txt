[Music: Dominic]

Sol has sunken behind the mountains
And the velvet curtain came falling
Daily world is put on hold and
The less of it we perceive
The brighter is the sight to beyond

Answer the firmament again
The wind plays the reeds
A signal for stellar voyagers
And like mist they will come

Waiting for a sign, back to see old friends
Appointed we are in carnation
Anointed into stellar civilians

Do you remember?
As a child you sometimes awoke in tears
With a sense of falling
And a familiarity to the stars

Thoughts pervade in looking for words
And stories start being told.

[Solos: Mat]
