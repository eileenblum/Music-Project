[Music: Patrick]

Do mourn, the glory days are gone
Like roaches scattering under a beaming light
Run out of history's backstage
As your flags burn over spoiled Eden
Looted for you to waste

Kings of the hill, inflated frogs, staged heroes, die!
Altogether World bowed in disrespect
Clenching teeth, towering hate
World won't ever know peace again!

In none we trust
Sowed salt within our soils
Fed us what even rats spit up
Perpetuating the times
When wealth spoke the speech
When wealth swung the whip
On sweat sown your power
Now harvest billions of enemies!

Oppression is deserved for who complies to fit within
It is fantasy freedom; tied to galleys we row
Docile on our way down the food chain
Livestock salivating at pellets in a trough

A fate to which we almost fell
Rolling meat screwed within the Machine
Silkworms soon to be boiled, all others denied awakening
Like cattle we were bred, raised and processed
Baited in with hopes for none to achieve
By scarecrows guarded under a gray sky
No wonder we were all afraid to open the cage, never...

Woe to you, mothers of all sores
Woe to the defeated
Great eagle fallen, feathered
In ire crowds come marching
Ignited, ablaze, exploding

Don't you smell the sour stench of demise?
Forseen all to nothing
