Excelsior
Like an evangel foreseen and staged
We will ascend to the heights
Setting other bodies in the sky
In hope to there sow our life
From created to creators
In the image of God, makers of worlds
An infinity of Babel Towers to defy Him

Free of morals and gravity, wandering
Higher, living lavishly the life of a god

The pride to leave a mark, even into the great night sky
Our desert islands to flee, as the mainland burns
Forgot about the World's woes
For we had higher matter to care for

Namely Jupiter to ignite, a star is born, literally
Steered the collisions, the mass increases, the core ignites
The secret industries worked, concealed
Sown the rocks that gravitate around
Fathers of the Jovian System
A progeny to enlighten...

The pride to leave a mark, even in the great night sky
Our desert islands to flee, as the mainland burns
Virgin grounds to seed with flagpoles
For we had higher matter to care fore
Namely Jupiter to ignite, a star is born, literally
Steered the collisions, the mass increases
No epitaph greater

Excelsior
Securely on trail at the Lagrangian point
A spheric horizon to scrutinate, infinity in all plans
Excelsior
We frolick through the stars
Hike asteroids as skerries
Towards the shores of forever
