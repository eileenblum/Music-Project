High in the sky, watchful eyes in the sky
Hovering overseers accounting men's deeds
Listeners of your prayers, bearers of guidance
Vril riding Sovereigns Unknown

Nestled where old maps showed monsters
Unknown places none dared to dwell
Kept men off our shores, playing on their fears
Like skillful fiddlers play their strings

But soon the tales didn't suffice
And an explorer ended our way
To his peers he told his journey
From desolation to luxuriance
Flying clumsily, across the ice sea
Our way came his tiny airplane
Greeted him with warmth and showed him our world
Still, he came back betraying

Off our shores then came
Their mountains of steel
Spewing smoke across the skies
Spat iron flies that we downed with ease
The midges challenged the eagle

On a fiery vessel he came
Now returns sailing derelicts
Counting his remaining hands
Almost swept overboard
From thousands a few were left

Adrift in the wake of the hurricane
The once victorious, cry seeing his might
Flotsam adrift onto the tide
But in the mind of unbelievers
None of this has ever been
Superstition blends in science's leaking infancy

Upward come the prayers of men
Nestling open their mouths in hope
Begging the skies
For the worm to come
