This cave...
Strange children once came out to face the light!
A few found their way, backed their tracks, into the gloom...

Down in a nightly world
They felt someone coming
Heard voices inside, elder souls spoke:

"Feeble people from above
Do prepare to meet the flesh of your legends
Witness the emergence
Sons of the skyless land come
Once deserters of the surface
Anthill Earth revealed in legends all over the world

Skyless diaspora
Driven away from the sun for so long
Erratic with burning eyes
Shocked before the horizon and its convexity

Rising, out of the deep, testifying our glory
Lost marvels meant to see the light at last
So far under your feet, few among you did conceive
In our outskirts you saw a world becoming yours

Sons of the skyless land come
Once deserters of the surface
Anthill Earth revealed in legends all over the world
Skyless diaspora
Driven away from the sun for so long
Conquered matter while you apes went scampering in trees
Then you got crowned over creation

Rising out of the deep, testifying our glory
(We) made mountains fly, conquered seven stars
Hollow realm under your feet
The vault of all mysteries
Legends are given life to outshine the lies
