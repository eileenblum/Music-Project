Sail the canopy above, like the surface of fertile sea
Up the streams to the source, we shall nurture the rebirth
Of the extant unknown

Sail the canopy above, like the surface of fertile sea
Up the streams to the source, we shall nurture the rebirth
Of the extant unknown

Up the streams to the source...

Holocene ends stirred worlds, eras switching, uprooting life
Lunacy roams again over the endless garden that we maintained
Travelers in the wind without a goal
Landing randomly and like for a surprise

One with the air
One with the trees
One with water and mud
One
One with the air
One with the light and the dark...

Sapiens annihilated habilis, erectus, pithecanthropus
Sapiens' turn has come to be doomed
Bones over erectus, pithecanthropus
Become the fossils for tomorrow to dig
A lower cladistic echelon, ancestor...

Facing the storm, facing perpetual upheaval
Out of chaos the abyss yield newborn mountains to dwell
Wandering, seemingly oblivious of destination
Without a star to guide yet the path goes straight forward
The dawn is rising, as earth bleeds fire
Healing as a new skin, new world emerge out of the wounds
Wandering, seemingly oblivious of destination
Without a star to guide yet the path goes straight forward

Those hills once were temples
And they'll soon sail over their land
Their nets bringing up old remains
Scriptures forgotten, to be eroded
Creatures go unseen and wither, civilizations to hibernate
You will sow your last seeds and wither, bound in animality...
