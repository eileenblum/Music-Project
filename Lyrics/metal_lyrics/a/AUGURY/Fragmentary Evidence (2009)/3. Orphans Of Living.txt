Signals received
The parasite awakes, in a pebble mind
Devil sat on his shoulder
Took over the reins
The now fumble guiding a carrion
Toy soldiers, they walk among us
Activated tools of the trade, engineering rather than born
With rage inoculated
All life is fair game

Triggered by the new game
The cause is a fake but now the weapons are for real
Raus, raus, raus
Heard a click, then vaporised in pink mist

Yet at night the haunting comes relentless
Mutilated faces becoming
Yet at night the haunting comes relentless
Mutilated faces becoming

One at war against the multitude, (engineer) rather than born
Tearless eyes whipped by sand
(Programmed) rather than raised
Sleepless children run across (the ravaged lands)
With the serene confidence of the invincible
