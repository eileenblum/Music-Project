Cataclysmic, temporal shifts of memory.
Vectors of light and dark refract
Warping once straight lines of existence.
A conundrum of creation.
The sin of the creator.
Shattered dreams of this
are beyond repair.
Psyche falls upon the floor
Cutting bare feet of those who tread
Into the entropic
space of their inhabitance.
Chasing and growing.
Spheres of influence capture fleeting thoughts
Of freedom, the eyes of the kempt begin to open.
Released into bondage everlasting.
A conundrum of creation
The sin of the creator
I have seen beyond the depths of creation
And summoned down daemons from the stars.
