What has this life given to me?
I tread this desolate theater of solitude,
And feel as a victim isolated.
A ghost where ghost do not belong,
Undertow with the footsteps at my back
Leave the shifted sand in the black â
Still lost but starting a new track.

Excepting this new life because I have nothing left as an option.
Spherical path, fill the circuit, living carefree donât forget me.
Confusion unable to predict whatâs left to come,
Jumping the gun, no one has won, what have I done?
Who cares I cannot take it back.

I blame no one for who Iâve become.
Forgiveness will not come from others, sometimes you must forgive yourself.
Itâs taken a long time for me to get here, walking the trail ready to fail
The world will not stop for my grief but autonomy lasts eternity.
I can feel it, my chance to escape â the time is now the door is open.
