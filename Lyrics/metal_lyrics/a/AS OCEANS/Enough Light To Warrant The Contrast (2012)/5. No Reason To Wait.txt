In the beginning addiction sets in
To feel whole requires no cracks in the surface.
How could something so fragile be held by such hands
By such inflicted hands
Dig too deep and the infection will take over
Fearing the end before parting in death.

Trust falters than flat lines
I will not compromise with this impasse
My retrospective vision altered in silence.

Retreating to put an end to misery.
Bleeding out wounds of expectation.

Truth is bereft of love.

Trapped in a cell without a key
Hope for an unattainable fantasy.

The debris is parted in dreaming
Every scream a prayer for sleep.
Still waiting for the day
To come to break my chains.

As I stand exhausted
Still I wait in vain
Still I wait.
