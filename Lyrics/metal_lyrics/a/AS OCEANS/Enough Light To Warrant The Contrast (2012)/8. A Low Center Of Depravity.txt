Much of life a visual complication.
A mural of devastating motion.
Generated to appease zero.
Admonish the opponents to discomfort
They lose touch with the spirit.

The inescapable nether where matter is king.
Step across the line to slowly devolve.
Temptation found behind every mirage of promise.
A fantasy where the motives wear the masks.

No escape.
Standing animate,
While the lifeless follow the sheep.
Isolated.

Sole refuge in the pulsating incentive.

Endomorphically filtered through adverse walls.
A state of mind vacant of fear. Seek truth in one, despite the cost.
Waning to a shade void of feeling.

Wholesomely aggregated in the midst of depletion.
Gaia draws acid tears.
My calloused skin has no need for raincoat.
Ridden of the torture of mortality,
By subscribing to the contradicting structures whose foundations have misguided us all.
