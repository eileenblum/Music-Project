No longer following whispers towards forsaken depths
or believing in a destiny of failure.
Looking through the arbiter's eyes.
Every breath taken is a waste.
Empty convictions kept in a stare.
Exiled before given a chance.
Evolving to individual purification.
Knowledge to disregard judgment
depletes the burden that
weighs down the weak.
Confronting the contrasts in the profiles passing.
The only thing shown is the layered perception.
Pull down the sun
to illuminate the world.
Nothing liable for condemnation.
Now inspired to blind us all.
No qualms taking away the cost of separation.
As the bounds of the spectrum narrow,
the distance disappears.
