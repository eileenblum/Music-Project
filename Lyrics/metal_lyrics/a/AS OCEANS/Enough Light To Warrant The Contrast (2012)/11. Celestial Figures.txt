An arousing first step, the second a shock of reality.
This stairwell ends in insight.
Our ascension is purely logical.
I am headed to a home much brighter than my own.

Finding the need for molecular composition fleeting.
An element hosting the dependant earthbound vitality.

Displayed here are densityâs true extremes, the ominous dualism.
I breathe nothing, for there is nothing to breathe.

Ionic clouds of static precision, portals to the edges of incomprehension.
Shapes the mind cannot fathom, they create the worlds for which we long.

Mineral masses hurtle through the nothingness, incandescent, as if to lead
the way.
Reaching a plateau of convalescence. Now look down upon the Earth.

Titanâs path. Feel her wrath.
Silent we wait.
Spiraling into deep slumber.

Viewing the frontier from a great distance.
Moments to revel in the nebulous.

The freezing vision blends with welcoming warmth.
A scene cerebral fabrications cannot contain.
A childâs recreation upon the divine canvass.

We have lived the illusion of being in total control.
Nomination to figures with given names.

An arrow through the arch aimed at the bull. The mother closely trailed by her cub.
All within the dragonâs watchful eye.

The marksmanâs waistband, our misconceived notion of direction.
Following the broken compass from infancy.

Each ornament an Eden by selfish definition.
I reach out to caress the tiny orb of light.
Distance is a deceitful construction.
It cloaks the description.

A serene city at the peak.
The embodiment of perfection.

I burn with the stars.
Leaving no trace of the perennial odyssey, the voyage draws an end.

My skin meets new terrain. Death has no meaning here.
No letters to distribute. No laws to abide.
Only a humble revelation.
