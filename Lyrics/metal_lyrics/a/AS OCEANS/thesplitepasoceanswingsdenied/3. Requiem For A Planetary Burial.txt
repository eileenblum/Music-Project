While upon the pursuit for a final peace,
All I've found is betrayal that leads to symphonies of heartache.
The venom in my tongues dismay, mouth an open
wound for nothing but diseased stress.
Shouldn't that be enough?
Gluttons for pain are you ever satisfied?

A plethora of misdeed, forsaken skeletons for starved eyes.
The wolves of misery have been fed; conditioned
to salivate and heel by a master the slave never knows is real.
But what if I told you what they're selling is burning the
world to ruin and we've all bought a share in the down fall!?

I'll take my chances while you remain afraid
To question - I will not be cornered.
The tyrant will never possess the upper hand
My arms the hearse to their control - a strength
within us all.
Refusing to be a victim of infamy that anchors down
free thought contingency.
You see, abandonment was engraved in me
I've let its curse rot away my mercy.
Purging on this flesh till all have fallen, having no pity for
Glorified addictions.

When will logic and reason take the place
of values collecting dust?

Inhumane acts of treason, hold their place on a throne of deception.
Ensure extinction to a falling kingdom - you're no longer
safe in a casket of bones.
