A bravery to explore the uncharted,
While in suspicion our minds can be bordered.
But have no use for a map, heart ache the enlightened
All have shared.
Misinterpreted by the ones who make logical
Decency appear impossible.
Worshipping a shell as a beacon of pride.

[Chorus:]
The Witness will not retribute your hatred.

Find reflection in the flowing river of connected trails.
Dealt a different hand upon every turn, proving the outcome can never be the same.
This contradiction makes a life like this possible to bear.

[Chorus:]
The Witness will not retribute your hatred
Of the subtle breaks between the separated self.

Mongers of tragedy who hide behind disintegrating shields
Claiming acts supported by an adored fear.
By having tasted liberation my whispers have changed
into the echoes of a shattered fist and a torn apart throat.
