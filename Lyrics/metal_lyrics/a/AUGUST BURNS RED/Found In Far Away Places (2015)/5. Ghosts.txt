[feat. Jeremy McKinnon]We are the ghosts of the midway, the beasts of the alley.
We are the living dead living in your nightmares.
Scraping ourselves from the earth, living as though we are dirt.
Staring like youâve seen a ghost.
The lowest of the low with nowhere to go.
Back from the dead, now weâre groveling at your feet.
Handcuffed for lying our heads as weâre withering in the streets.
Back from the dead, now weâre groveling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as weâre withering in the streets

Fighting for your attention.
Begging for your generosity.
Looking up just to see you turn your cheek on me.
You walk on by like Iâm invisible (invisible).
All I want is to be seen as an equal.
We fought your battles, and we built your homes.
Sorry if I disturbed you.
I just wish we could live like you do.
Even in our most beautiful days itâs dark.
Just look at the world around you.
Thereâs a consequence for what we do.
Pass judgment on me as you walk.
Picture perfect ainât my obsession.
You canât sum up my life from a first impression.
Learn your lesson.
Act like you know me, but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothinâ, you got nothinâ to lose.
Act like you know me, but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothinâ, you got nothinâ to lose

I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me.
You and I, we were once the same.
I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me
You and I, we were once the same
I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me
You and I, we were once the same
I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me
You and I, we were once the same
