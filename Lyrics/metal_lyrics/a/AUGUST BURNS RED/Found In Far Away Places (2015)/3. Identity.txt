Do you know how it feels to hide
with thoughts repressed deep down inside?
I guess you just loved the lie.
Truth is, you canât decide where my heart resides.

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick.
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am.
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
and cast aside from the man that I am.

Iâve never felt so free.
It kills me to hear you say you âchoose to love me.â
I was hoping that would be a given, given our history.
Iâve never felt so free, so free

You think Iâm wrong, you think Iâm wrong
but I never felt better.

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie.
I thought blood was thicker than water.
You think Iâm wrong but I never felt better. [2x]

I know I disappointed you,
but Iâve got nothing to prove.

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick.
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am.
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand,
but now Iâve realized this is who I am.
Iâve made my decision, youâre either with or against me.

Youâre either with or against me. [2x]

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie.
I thought blood was thicker than water.
You think Iâm wrong but I never felt better.

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie.

Iâm standing firm. Itâs who I am.
You canât keep me, you canât keep me down.
IÊ¼m moving on. Iâm living free.
You canÊ¼t stop me, you canÊ¼t stop me now. [2x]
