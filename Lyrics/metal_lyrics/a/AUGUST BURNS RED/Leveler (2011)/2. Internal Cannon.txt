IâveÂ fearedÂ the deepest darkest secrets that live inside of me.
Defeat and tragedy, walking in shame, finding nowhere to hide.
Iâve thrown my bottles of guilt into the sea, hoping the waves carry them away
from me.

Oh....

My heart is beating. Iâll never stop fighting. Iâll keep breathing...
My heart is beating. Iâll never stop fighting. Iâll keep breathing to stay
alive.

And here I go, off to make a change. Iâm screaming... screaming revival.

All of my strength, all of my might, will go into this to take back my life.
All of my strength, all of my might, will go back into this to take back my
life...
...my life...Â my life...Â my life. Iâm taking back my life... my life...Â my
life...Â my life... taking back my life.

Letâs go....

This song is music to my ears... (this song is music...)
and is a new production on an old stage (...on an old stage).
I wonât dwell in unhappiness (IÂ will not dwell in...), grasping humility,
asking forgiveness.
Tomorrow is gone, Iâll start living for today.Â IâllÂ never stop the fighting and
Iâll take it all away.
Tomorrow is gone, Iâll start living for today. Iâll never stop the fighting and
Iâll take it away
