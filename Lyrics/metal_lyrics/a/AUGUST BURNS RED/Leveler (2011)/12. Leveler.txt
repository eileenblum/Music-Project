You have become a malicious liar that breaths for attention,
playing charades, wearing the head of a lamb. My days consumed by nights of you.
Howling at the moon as if you were wounded, but no,
youâre the one showing teeth, ready to feast on newborn beginnings as you cry wolf.
Howling at the moon, but no, youâre showing teeth.
We know. Youâre ready to feast on newborn beginnings as you cry wolf.

8,064 hours of conspiracies. 200 months which brings me 17 years of lies and betrayal.
The truth. Never seen. Never told. Never known.
Youâll never tell the truth. Never seen. Never heard. Youâll never tell the truth.
All I want is the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth. (Oh...)

Queen of hearts. Queen of hearts.
But you are the deceiver with a lying tongue and matching lips.
My heart thirsts for vengeance, but my Father has taught me forgiveness.
If I had not decided to follow Him, Iâd devour you like a lion, leaving your bones out to dry.
Iâd put you through the same hell you put me through, pouring out conspiracies and lies, (and lies)
but this world will remember me for all that Iâve done and all that Iâll be.

The victim in me is dead. I am reborn. The victim in me is dead. I am reborn.
So even though you call me self-righteous and call my beloved treacherous, there is one thing to take away:

Leveler, make level the road for the righteous.
Leveler, make level the road for the righteous.

I forgive you, queen of hearts, for through me, He will show you true love.
Love.
I forgive you, queen of hearts, for through me, He will show you true love.
Love. Love.
I forgive you, queen of hearts, for through me, He will show you true love.
Love. Love....
