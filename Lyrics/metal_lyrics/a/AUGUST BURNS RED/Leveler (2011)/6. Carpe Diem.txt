Iâve thrown away all of my outside distractions.
Iâm diving headfirst to chase a dream that I wonât let go.

Itâs worthless - a waste of time. This goal is out of reach. You better fall back in line.

This is what I need. You are what I need.
I need motivation to prove you wrong, and I will prove you wrong.

What makes you think that you are different?
How can you chase these dreams? Theyâve become a chore.

I know Iâm close. Iâm almost there.
Just a little more, and I will prevail through what you call "ignorance". I will prevail.

Now Iâve chased this dream to do what I love, and I wouldnât trade it for a thing.
Now Iâve chased this dream and I made it out alive. I wouldnât trade it for a thing.
I threw away what naysayers say, and started on a race that I had to win for myself.

And you proved me wrong, you proved me wrong.

All Iâve learned is teaching me more. All I know is driving me on.

All Iâve learned is teaching me more. All I know is driving me on.
