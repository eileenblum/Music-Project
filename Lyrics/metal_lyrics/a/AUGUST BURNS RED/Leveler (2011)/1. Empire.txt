Skyscrapers, Earthmovers, Ground Breakers
Our buildings rival the Heavens
Our bridges span the seas
Ingenuity is so cunning
Innovation is not ours
Creativity is a luxury
We build with our hands what we have in our hearts
Fight the Avalanche
You'll be buried everytime
We run and run and run
Keep falling behind
Fight the Avalanche
You'll be buried everytime
We run and run and run
Always last in line
Before lines were lines
Before time was time
The author wrote a story in the sky - and earth below
Little do we know
We have only what we're given
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
We're going where no man..
Little do we know
We have only what we're given
Light up the sky
We're going where no man's forgotten
All you are is all we want
It burns inside us all
We're finding heart in giving soul
We're walking home into thin air
SINGING
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Many walk away, but we stand firm
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Our decisions affect our descendants
We are justice fighters with faces of fire
Skyscrapers, Earthmovers, Ground Breakers
Our footsteps, bringing purpose, changing history
