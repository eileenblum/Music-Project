Youâre living for today, but your future is looking bleak. One day itâll all come crashing down.
Nothing lasts forever. Youâve only planned for the here and now.
IÂ said: Nothing lasts forever. Live fast, die young.

Live fast and die young. Itâs whatâs ahead, but just remember:
slow and steady wins the race, so pick your head up and keep your mouth shut.

You are the captor of originality. You are the thief of authenticity.
Respect is something that youâll never see. Everything you write all sounds the same.
Youâre forsaken. Forsaken on this mountain. The bridges have turned to ash.

This is your final hour. This is your great fall.
You wonât make it out alive, so say your dearest goodbyes.

You are Goliath standing firm in your light. We are David and youâre in our sights.
You are Goliath standing firm in your light. We are David and youâre in our sights.
Your dreams have come true. Have you forgotten the reason why?

Life, death, dreams, wealth - nothing lasts forever.
Greed, envy, gluttony will amount to nothing. Nothing lasts forever.

The earth is about to quake. The earth is about to quake. The earth is about to quake.
Brace for impact. Run for the hills. Brace for impact. Itâs a long way home.
Brace for impact. Run for the hills. Youâll surely end here.

Goliath, weâre screaming your name. Goliath, weâre coming for you.
