Living in a world of regrets.
You never wanted this and you never will [x2]
Watching your mirror image, drowning in a lake of your own sorrows, your own sorrows.
But we will pray, that you will pray, you will look toward the skies.
Look toward the skies, which covers you, like blankets, and see his open arms.
Look toward the skies.
Look toward the skies.

You claim, you claim you were built to fall.
You were never strong enough.

You claim, you claim you were built to fall.
You were never strong enough.

Heroin has no healing to this unfortunate tragedy.
Don't stray from what you've become now, to who you were then.
With a needle in your arm.
Now affection has abandoned you, can you still feel.
Now affection has abandoned you, can you still feel.
Hold on!
Hold on, don't you die.
Hold on, don't you die on me.
Living in a world of regrets you never wanted this and you never will.
You claim you were built to fall, you were never strong enough.
You claim you were built to fall, you were never strong enough.
Save yourself.

You claim, you claim you were built to fall, you were never strong enough.
You claim, you claim you were built to fall, you were never strong enough.
