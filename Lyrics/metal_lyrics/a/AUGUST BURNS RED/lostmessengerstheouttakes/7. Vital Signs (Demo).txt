This building barley standing on its own foundation. [x2]
I've collapsed its lungs, calloused its heart sucked the life out of this, for all of Sunday to see. [x2]

I've collapsed its lungs, calloused its heart sucked the life out of this, for all of Sunday to see. [x2]
Every little thing they believe, they believe.

I've taken the breath out of everything they stand for.

Everything they hold true.
Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one sees my effort.
Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one gets the point.

No one sees my effort, no one gets the point.
Welcome to my dying home.
Welcome inside these crumbling walls.
A meaningless handshake greets them all with smiles of false hope.

Welcome to my dying home.
Welcome inside these crumbling walls.
A meaningless handshake greets them all with smiles of false hope.
Do I even care as I watch a sea of people dwindling into an audience of skin and bones -- an audience who doesn't have the strength to walk out on a man who has tarnished their faith?

I've collapsed its lungs, calloused its heart sucked the life out of this, for all of Sunday to see.[x2]
I've collapsed its lungs, calloused its heart sucked the life out of this, for all of Sunday to see.[x2]

Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one sees my effort.
Preaching to the deaf and blind, no one gets the point.
