Fallen captive
You've fallen captive
To what you thought would save you
What you thought would clean your slate
You're in the thick of it now (in the thick of it now)
And you have swallowed the hook

What's done is done
We'll continue on
With or without you
Pain must exist
In order for healing to survive
In order for healing to survive

Neither one will ever serve their purpose alone (survive)
Neither one will ever serve their purpose alone

You've fallen in love with a dream you've never had (you never dreamed)
You've fallen in love with a surreal way of living

Too late to wake
Farewell and good luck to you
See you at the end
Too late to wake
Too late to wake
Too late to wake
I guess this is farewell
And good luck to you
I thought we'd live to tell
This is my goodbye

Don't worry
We saw through your trickery
Weâre coming out alive
See you at the end
What was once your life
Is now lifeless
What was once your life
Is now your jail cell
What was once your life
Is now lifeless
What was once your life
Is now your jail cell
