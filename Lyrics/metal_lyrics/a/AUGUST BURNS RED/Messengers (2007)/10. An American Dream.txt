Suffocation
Suffocate with no room to breath

Forgive us for ânowâ is too late
This is not an American dream
This is no longer an American dream
This is no longer an American dream (American dream)

We are trying to breathe
We are trying to breathe underwater
Trying to breathe
Underwater

The few, the proud, no longer sing their song
One nation under God
It's us against the world
One nation under God
It's us against the world
Itâs us against the world (us against the world)
Itâs us against the world (us against the world)

We've cut the tongue from society
Forcing consumption
Never hearing ânoâ
We've brainwashed our children
To believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten
Still counting their 1, 2, 3's
We've brainwashed our children
To believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten
Still counting their 1, 2, 3's

Forgive us for ânowâ is too late
Forgive us for fueling the flame

This is not an American dream any longer
As we've become spoiled, rotten, counting our 1, 2, 3's

Disease infesting our young
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
