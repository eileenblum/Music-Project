We've heard the sound
That ears bleed to hear
The sound of a place
The entire universe awaits

Here the strongest fall to their knees
A passion so powerful that walls crumble
To their foundations
Here the strongest fall to their knees
The lost find their way back home
Here the strongest fall to their knees
The lost find their way back home
But the masses buy what will make them rich
Feasting on lies
Chasing their tails
Truth be told
They'll get what they were promised

Crawling away
Burning with regret
To the deepest, darkest depths
Crawling away
Burning with regret
To the deepest, darkest depths
Of hell

We got news for you
We got news for you
The day is soon coming
When turning your back
Won't be an option
We got news for you
The day is soon coming
When turning your back
Won't be an option

Keep telling yourself what you really don't believe
You can compromise
What you know to be true
And you can turn off
All of your senses
But in the end you'll see
But in the end youâll see
Nothing stands between a man and his maker
Nothing stands between a man and his maker

No, no matter what it's your decision
No matter what, it's your decision
This isn't something you could do alone
Go!

No matter what it's your decision
(Give up, give in)
Give up, give in, no matter what
It's your decision
Give up, give in, no matter what
It's your decision
Give up, give in, no matter what
It's your decision
Give up, give in, no matter what
It's your decision
