Convictions
To the back burner
Convictions
To the back burner
Remembering what's really important isn't so important after all

Gather all your possessions
Smile cause you've got it all
Gather all your possessions
Smile cause you've got it all
Smile cause you've got it all
Smile cause you've got it all

Still that empty feeling
Won't go away
Still that empty feeling
Won't go away
Your puzzle's missing one very essential piece
(And I know you'll) keep looking in all the wrong places until it's too late (until itâs too late)

Slip on the ice again
When did you become so cold?
Living for the here and now never made so much, so much sense
Slip on the ice again
When did you become so cold

You think you've got all the time in the world, but this could all be ending...
Now!

How far down will you go
Before it's too late?
Slipping on the ice again
You've become so cold

Lucky for you rock bottom is in sight
Lucky for you rock bottom is in sight
Your wake up call is set for now
And the trail you have followed
Has come all the way to the end

I hope you survive
Survive the crash
