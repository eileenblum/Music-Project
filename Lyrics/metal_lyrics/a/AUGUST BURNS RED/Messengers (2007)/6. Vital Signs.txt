This building is barely standing
On its own foundation
On its own foundation

I've collapsed its lungs
Calloused its heart
Sucked the life out of this
For all of Sunday to see
For all of Sunday to see
I've collapsed its lungs
Calloused its heart
Sucked the life out of this
For all of Sunday to see
For all of Sunday to see

I've taken the breath out of everything they believe, they believe
I've taken the breath out of everything they hold true
Everything they hold true

Preaching to the deaf and blind
No one sees my effort
Preaching to the deaf and blind
No one gets the point
No one sees my effort
No one gets the point

Welcome to my dying home (dying home)
Welcome inside these crumbling walls
A meaningless handshake
Greets them all with smiles of false hope
Welcome to my dying home (dying home)
Welcome inside these crumbling walls

Do I even care as I watch a sea of people
Dwindling into an audience of skin and bones
An audience who doesn't have the strength
To walk out on a man who has tarnished their faith

I've taken the breath out of everything they believe, they believe
I've taken the breath out of everything they stand for

Preaching to the deaf and blind
No one sees my effort
Preaching to the deaf and blind
No one gets the point
