You are infatuated, with what consumes you.
Put the victim on the front lines and left for dead.
Stop acting like there's no... no other option but to let the waves carry you away.
Can you hold the water responsible for your wayward behavior, any more than it blames you for its gripping currents?
Erase the proof... erase the proof but your shame will remain.
Your shame will remain... will remain...
Your shame will remain.
Your shame will remain.

Will you always need someone to hold your hand, and talk... talk you through... you through the night's shadows?
It's so much easier to fight this war when you're the last in line... when you're the last in line.
Can you hold the water... can you hold the water responsible for your wayward behavior, any more than it blames you for its gripping currents?
What will you become? What will become of you? What will you become? What will become of you?
Your mind is the mountain before you - You've reached the summit, now transcend the skies.
You've reached the summit, now transcend the skies.
