This moment will too pass us by.
It's this notion inside all of us to prioritize through our selfish eyes.
To be the bull behind the rampage, the reason for all the riot.
We'll feed our flame before wasting time on everyone else's, with more problems and less pride.
We'll feed our flame before wasting time on everyone else's, the gallows were not supposed to look like this.
Oh God, we live in misery, lying here in desperation.
We need you here more than anything right now...right now.
If everything's relative, then why the emptiness in our souls?
If everything's relative, then why the emptiness in our souls?
Trying to untie the knot we thought we were untying our entire lives, we're busied up and burnt out..
Everyone together, we will strengthen ourselves.
Everyone together, we will strengthen ourselves.
Everyone together, we will strengthen ourselves.
We will.... Because now we know you won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still.
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still.
Stop, listen, and learn. Stop, listen, and learn.
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still.
Stop, listen, and learn.
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still.
Stop, listen, and learn.
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still.
Stop, listen, and learn.
You won't ever fly fast enough to make time stand still.
Stop, listen, and learn.
