We all hurt
We all need
We all cry
We all bleed
These dreams, these desires
Consume me

The good, the bad, the ugly
Aren't too much to take
I've been put in this position
But now I can't bear to leave

Stand here with me
Together we'll get through this
Stand here with me
And we'll wash it all away

Without you I'm nothing, yes
I've come to understand this
Without you I'm worthless, yes
I've come to understand this

I've been handed my life by you
The least I can do is listen (listen)
Pull me aside, and step inside
I'll listen to your horror stories

Let this song be your motivation
Let your life be your inspiration
You can't hide your fear in this chorus
In this chorus forever

If I could do more
I promise you I would
But this is your time
If I could do more
I promise you I would
But this is your time now

Whisper your grief
Scream your sorrow
Proclaim your love
Just don't call me your hero
Whisper your grief
Scream your sorrow
Proclaim your love
Just don't call me your hero

Tell me your stories, I'll lend you my ears
Tell me your horror, I'll make it disappear
I'm absorbing the impact of the young at heart
Young at heart

We all hurt, we all need
We all cry, we all bleed
We have hope
We all hurt, we all need (we all hurt)
We all cry, we all bleed
We have hope
We all hurt, we all need (we all need)
We all cry, we all bleed
We have hope
