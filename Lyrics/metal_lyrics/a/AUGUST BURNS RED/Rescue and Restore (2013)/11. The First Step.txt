Without competition there is no progression
Society won't wait for statues
To break free of their brass case

Carry the point
Be the focus
Notice the inevitable
Times make changes
Humanity makes mistakes
Mistakes make answers
We live to learn

We live to learn
We live to love
We live to die
Learn to question why
We live to learn
We live to love
We live to die
Learn to question why (why)

We're so scared to take the first step, so scared (so scared)
(Why)
We're so scared

The ground you walk on isn't a straight line
And neither are the toils of life
Standing still, just to watch it pass you by
To watch the world pass you by

We are pushing for change
Waiting for the world to take notice
Breaking down barriers
As we strive for a better way

With determination we'll march on in protest
With determination we'll see this through
Evolve or die
Move on or drown
Evolve or die
Move on or...
Drown!
Drown!
Evolve or die
Move on or down (or drown)

History's "greatest generation" will be removed by the Earth's most advanced
Your battles will become our peace
Your lies shall become our truth
We will replace the old guard with the new
Your battles will become our peace
Your lies shall become our truth
Your battles will become our peace
Your lies will become our truth!

Without competition there is no progression
Society won't wait for statues
To break free of their brass case
Evolve or die
