This is a barren wasteland
A lonely place
Where inspiration goes to die

Rescue the beauty that's left
Restore the character that's long since gone
Because these colors must never fade
This beat must carry on

We will fight to save this
We will fight to keep it alive
This is a cause worth fighting for
We will rescue &amp; restore
We will fight to save this
We will fight to keep it alive
This is a cause worth fighting for
We will rescue &amp; restore
