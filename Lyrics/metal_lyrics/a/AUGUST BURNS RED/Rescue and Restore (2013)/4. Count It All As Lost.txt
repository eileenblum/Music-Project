I wanna believe these words are more than letters to me
I want to believe
A covenant to stand the battlefield of time
Many times I've written words holding me to stay pure
Where is the truth in these motions
Afterwards feeling motionless (motionless)

I keep breaking my promises
I keep breaking my word to you and I
I keep breaking my promises
Once again, I'm letting you down

How must a broken man fix his brokenness if he's not the answer?

I can't do this on my own
On my own
I need you here (here)
I need you here (here)
I need you here

Each and every day that passes leaves me worse off than before
Many times I've sworn I wouldn't look back, never look back

Instead of fighting to be a man
I just wanna know who I am

Fighting with my fists leaves me bloody and broken
Almost every single time

so I'm going at it with your strength instead of mine
Please be my strength
so I'm going at it with your strength instead of mine
Please be my strength

I need you here
I need you here!

I've carried this burden long enough
With a heart of conviction
I've betrayed us both
I have to forfeit
The shame is too much to...
Take the lead and reign over me
Reign, reign
Reign over me
Reign, reign
Reign over me

You knew you'd find me here (find me here)
It took me losing sight
To count it all as lost (all as lost)
To see that I'm finally found

Count it all as lost
There's so much more to gain
Count it all as lost
Take the lead and reign over me
