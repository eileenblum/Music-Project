There is beauty in tragedy
The heart will stop beating
But the end is a new beginning
We'll soar above the skyline of reality
And reach towards a love ever after
As we're grasping onto faith
To keep us breathing a little longer, a little longer
For just one moment with one another, with one another
This night is pulling on my heartstrings
These feelings bring tears to my eyes

To see you leave my world
To leave my side
Hear the angels sing
As they embrace you
With a warm welcome home
With a warm welcome home
Hear the angels sing
Hear the angels sing

Tomorrow, the air will be a little colder
But I'll be sure to breathe for the both of us
And the nights may be a little darker
But I'll be sure to carry the torch to warm the hearts
That never got to feel yours
I can't hear your voice
I can't hear your voice
But that's OK
Cause I can feel you in my heart
I can't hear your voice
I can't hear your voice
But that's OK
Cause I can feel you in my heart

One morning I'll wake up to you
One morning I'll hear the angels sing
On that morning we won't be worried about the weather
Nor will we mind
Where the hands lay
On the clock tower

I'll be sure to write your name in the sand
Where the waves can't wash it away
I'll be sure to write your name in the sand
Where the waves can't wash it away

Until then I'll walk
Until then I'll breathe in your name
Never surrender the dream you had for this world
To love
To forgive
To make something out of nothing

I will feel you, I will hear you,
Forever!
