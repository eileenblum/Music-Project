How must you feel up there?
So exalted
With such a haughty attitude
No one's inferior to your wise words, my dearest friend

Acting as though you have authority to judge
You do not have permission (do not have permission)
Who gave you license to pour hate down throats
Bringing them a shameful disposition?
Disposition

No one likes a discouraging word
Slurring out of a drunkard's mouth
Intoxicated on his own pride
Intoxicated on his own pride

How do you feel, safe and secure? (safe and secure)
You were wrong
You judge the faith, lives, and actions
Based on your insecurities

Words cut like blades to the skin
Making people numb to feeling
Words cut like blades to the skin
Why can't you realize what you are doing?

Where is their self worth now? (now)

Running miles far away based on your invitation
Cage your mouth
And listen to your heart
We are not animals
Nor are you to be one
We are who we are
From beginning to end

Don't judge the loved
Stop hating the hurt
Quit living for selfish demands
If you don't stop while you're ahead
Pride will lead you to self-destruct

Kingdom come, no one is done
All have been forgiven
We are who we are
From beginning to end
(Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven)
Kingdom come, no one is done
All have been forgiven
We are who we are
From beginning to end
