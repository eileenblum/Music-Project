[Dedicated to Todd Lankton]

Rarely the rare are seen
In the ocean of chaotic reality
This lighthouse gives direction, caution, and awareness
In the dark and distant, this man is still seen
His fierce devotion to what he believes
Is true, as he feels the weight of this collapsed nation

Staring into the face of adversity
He will remain
With courage and bravery (and bravery)
It keeps him walking towards the flames
He will remain
In good faith that he will remain

"Our existence is an imprint
We all have a legacy to live,"
He says to me (he will remain)
"Our existence is an imprint
We all have a legacy to live,"
He says to me (he will remain)

His grace is such a blessing
Surely it's something to write home about
Its presence never recognized while life passes by
Never stopping to thank you
"Be calm, just sleep
Let your heavy spirit rest its knees
You've been running for so many years,"
He says to me, he says to me
A true inspiration, a light in the dark and distant
I stop my life to thank you
You have carried me through the storm
Through its heavy winds, I stop my life to thank you

Rarely the rare are seen
What's seen as defeat is his philosophy
Better to be a one-man army
Than a cavalry hurdling the weak
He brings comfort to the masses in the name of compassion
His merit, his amour
Clears the path for the broken down and defeated
To see the masterpiece that's painted in our names
"What we see is not all we believe," (we believe!)
He will remain
"What we see is not all we believe," (we believe!)
He will remain
