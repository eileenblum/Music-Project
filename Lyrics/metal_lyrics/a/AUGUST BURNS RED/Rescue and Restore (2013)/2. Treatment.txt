Stop turning life into a stagnant routine
Maybe it's better to bite your tongue
The more animosity you spit out
The less we want to hear
Maybe it's better to bite your tongue

Too many hearts filled with hate
Too many hands clenched in fists
Relax your grip

Open the gates
Open the gates
Too many hearts filled with hate

Let acceptance in

We're here to say the world needs more diversity
We're here to say we're all so sick of your bigotry
Pay attention to the choices you make
Step back and look at all the hearts that you break

Stop dwelling on what happens when we die
Start helping others while we're still alive
Stop dwelling on what happens when we die
Start helping others while we're still alive

You need to look in the mirror and ask yourself,
"What good have I done?
What are my true intentions?"
It's your right to say what's on your mind
Yet it's their right to keep feeling alive (feeling alive)

We'll carve out your heart
Rewire your mind
Stripping your soul of everything that makes you unique
We'll carve out your heart
Rewire your mind
Stripping your soul of everything that makes you unique

We'll wipe the slate clean that brought them to their knees
Will that make you believe in the tolerance you need?
You crown your religion
Instead of your King

It's time for a movement to stand up and believe,
Believe that being distinct is not a disease
Open the gates
Let acceptance in
Open the gates
Relax your grip of disapproval
