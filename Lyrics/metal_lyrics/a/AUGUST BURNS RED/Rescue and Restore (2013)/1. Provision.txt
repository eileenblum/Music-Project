You give us dreams to wake us up
You say, "Take pride in the provision"
When all we see is the face of defeat you say,
"Take pride in the provision"

My future's finally found me, figured me out
It's painful, it's tough
I never saw it coming
Come as it may
'Cause all of this life is a lesson
I'd rather learn than end up in a cold covered up dark grave

These are the words of a man
Who finally let go
These are the goals of a man
Who's laid it all down

Losing it all made me realize I am the victim
The culprit, the casualty, and the cause
Losing it all led me to you (to you)
Losing it all led me to you

I'm sick
I need sight
I need help
I need you
And I'm not getting any better

I am the deceiver
I'm not getting any better
I'm the thief, the whore, the murderer

It's times like these, it's times like these
You forget to remember who you are
The way up is down
Truth is found
When life throws you out and kicks you to the curb
I'm just as much the problem as the man behind bars
He did with his business what I do in my heart

You wronged me, you crossed me
I'll never let it ruin me
Lessons are learned, deep down within my heart
In my heart

The worst men make the best stories come true
The past is a part of me, but not who I am
I realize my identity is not in what I've seen
But in what I believe to be true

I know what I need now
I know what I need
All that was lost is not lost
Even the worst of mankind can't disrupt sovereignty

You've given me this nightmare to wake me up
You say, "Take pride in the provision"
You've given me more than enough
You say, "Take pride in the provision"
