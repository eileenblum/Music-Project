The pressure is endless
The tension is pounding
Life change after life change
It's too much for me to take
While mourning the loss I am forced to celebrate
Celebrate new life, celebrate new life

When is it too much?
When is it enough?
Burrow deep down inside
Somewhere, anywhere, a place to hide

I'm collapsed, about to burn
This will end me, set me ablaze
I'm collapsed, about to burn
I am about to explode

I can't take much more of this
Where is my way out?

Waiting for this page to turn
I can't even bear the silence
Where is the ringing in my ears to sing me to sleep?
Where are those who feel what I feel?
Why can't I see the lights shining down on me?
Home will always be where my heart lives
Where it belongs
But this is, this is my way out

This is our home away from home
Pouring our hearts across the stage
With every word, we sing together
Screaming our anthem with one another

[2x]
The open road is what I need to breathe
Breathe in, breathe out

Breathe in, breathe out [2x]
