Don't you understand me?
Don't you understand me?
This cloud over my head is not okay, is not okay.
There are things that I need to get done, need to get done.
There are things that I need to get done, need to get done.
And it doesn't give you permission to take a shot below the belt.

What a bittersweet symphony life is,
But I wouldn't have it any other way.

We have so little time, let's not spend it in anger, in anger, in anger.
I am in the deep end and can't find air, I can't find air.

I am throwing punches with a blindfold on.
I am throwing punches with a blindfold on.
I am throwing punches with a blindfold on.
I am throwing punches with a blindfold on.

Because I may just brake suddenly.

I would rather not explode - that's your job.
I'm stuck in between two worlds in a maze of dreams and thoughts.

What a bittersweet symphony life is,
But I wouldn't have it any other way.
