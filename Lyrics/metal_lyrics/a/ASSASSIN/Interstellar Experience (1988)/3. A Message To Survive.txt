Hey you listen to me, I have to tell you
that life will change, if you really want it.
The world will not survive if you wait for a Messiah.
You have to show a spirit and have to believe it.

[Pre-chorus/Chorus:]
You will die if you don't change,
Come on and show your will.
Peace will come soom if we love our children
Much harder than a flag or a nation.

Iron curtain has to break, Berlin wall has to fall.
The world was made as one creation.
If we don't act, forget the future

[Pre-chorus/Chorus]
