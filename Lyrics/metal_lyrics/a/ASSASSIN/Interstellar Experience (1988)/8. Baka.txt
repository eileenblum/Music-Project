Panic fucking Bachmann just arrived all nations
should get ready to defend their people's lives
The future is threatened
his breath does destroy the progress is stopped
The moral of the story
shows importance as unimportant
Baka
Power of money believe in religion, it's the last time
the sun shines down on us
Rampant polution advanced technology turns the day
into dark night
Baka
Baka
Histeria, we lost our sense of humor,
total chaos rules the streets tonight
The ministry of defense gives the orders to be happy,
but not a single a single laugh can be heard on earth
Baka
