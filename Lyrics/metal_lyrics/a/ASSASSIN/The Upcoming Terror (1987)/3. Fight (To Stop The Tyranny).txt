Death, swords and inhuman minds control our world
Marxists, nazies and communists steel freedom
From our lifes

Go wild you banging crowd
Destroy there rules of tyranny
What we will stay about life, when we are living free

Fight for, fight for right
Fight for, fight for fight for freedom now

Fight for, fight for right
Fight to stop the tyranny

The masses of people are on the road
And starting riot and strikes
Spending all of their energy to kill
The kings of our world
