Nemesis hordes of hades are blasting over the earth
Saveness diapering frightening of the human

Death for the guilty one, no hope is given to them
No mercy as a result, Nemesis will punish them

Deathly breeze of wind plunging into the city
Unimaginable creatures arrived and spread
Out into their streets

Pain for the guilty one
Destruction is what they earn
After ruling a period of time, Nemesis punish the:

Cruel which killed thousands of innocent lifes

Death to these old kings which slayed our children

Execution has begun, the goddess decided to kill
Massacre creates a new world, blood has to be spoile

The horrors which are over exist not any longer
The humane race is saved, Nemesis disappearing

How long would freedom stay?
Will Nemesis save us again or was it just a dream

Our goddess will:

Stay a myth forever remembered
We need her help to ever survive
