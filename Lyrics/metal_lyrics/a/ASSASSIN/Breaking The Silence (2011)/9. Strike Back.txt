[Music: Scholz - Lyrics: Gonnella]

Cops through the door, I'm one on the floor, handcuffed as a criminal,
Screams full of pain, so insane, dissolved into nothingness,
Come on start chaos, thrash it hard like a kick in your ass,
Watch out behind you, or you'll be down now biting the grass,
Running, storming and screaming, the wild rampage escalates,
With a blaster, the disaster, the withdrawal of the cops even faster,
Come on start chaos, thrash it hard like a kick in your ass,
Watch out behind you, or you'll be down now biting the grass,
Strike back, strike back of what attacks, never surrender, strike back
Pushed by the cops, liek some dogs, into the total underground
Hunted 'til the end, until death, we run for our life,
Come on start chaos, thrash it hard like a kick in your ass,
Watch out behind you, or you'll be down now biting the grass,
Strike back, strike back of what attacks, never surrender, strike back
We never tolerate your slavery, we never surrender and always strike back,
Strike back, get out of your misery, strike back whatever attacks

[Solo: Michael]

Our hatred is the terror, which brings you sorrow, it always be pure hell,
Feel the power of hate, our only fate, the destruction of the state

[Solo: Michael]

Our hatred is the terror, which brings you sorrow, it always be pure hell,
Feel the power of hate, our only fate, the destruction of the state,
Radical militia, on the rising, the hour to strike back, now is the time to attack
The call to strike back and attack is in operation, united by fear, we are here, ready to counter strike,
The new offence is to tense, crushing all the opposition,
Victory arrived undisguised, total celebration
Come on start chaos; thrash it hard like a kick in your ass,
Watch out behind you, or you'll be down now biting the grass,
Strike back, strike back of what attacks, never surrender, strike back,
We never tolerate your slavery, we never surrender and always strike back.
