[Music: Hoffmann - Lyrics: Gonnella / Hoffmann]

Don't really care, I will get my share, they call me the maniac who doesn't really care,
Don't even think, that I will see a shrink,
Don't wanna go, I will make my show, just watch me really good that you never really would,
Don't even try, you will make me smile,

The unknown factor of the luck, is a friend and that is a fact

Don't wanna hide, I will get my pride, I'm the only king with all skills on my side,
Don't even tell, you will burn in hell
Don't wanna leave, I will be your thief, faster than you think, I will be your pimp,
Don't ever quit, I will raise it,

The unknown factor of the luck, is a friend and that is a fact

Raise in the dark, that's how I will play,
Fear the raise in the dark.

Don't wanna teach, I'm here to preach, listen really close how all rules are breached,
Don't even bet, your money I will get
Don't wanna stay, you are here to pay, you always gonna loose against my seven deuce,
Don't ever stop, I'm at the top

The unknown factor of the luck, is a friend and that is a fact

Raise in the dark, that's how I will play,
Fear the raise in the dark, all in or nothing today

[Solo: Michael]
