[Music: Scholz / Hoffmann - Lyrics: Gonnella]

Fighting for my life with a total certainty,
No matter what attacks, I'll stay alive! Kill or be killed!
Threatening all my values and my human dignity,
With a bright smile in my eyes I will survive. Kill or be killed!

"VIOLENCE" is forced upon thee, surrender your free will you gonna die!
"SUFFERING" pure terror will await you, dare it bastard I will make you cry!

Forcing me to war and into hopeless misery,
I'll fuck you up and I will shot to kill. Kill or be killed!
Driving me insane with religion to remain,
Don't test it cause it's you who gets the pain. Kill or be killed!

"VIOLENCE" is forced upon thee, surrender your free will you gonna die!
"SUFFERING" pure terror will await you, dare it bastard I will make you cry!

Unadvanced, intolerance, it's an eye for an eye!
You must sedate, all things you hate, your spirits flying high!
Just die!

[Solo: Scholli / Michael]

Just double cross my trust, now you choose the way you gonna die,
Next moment you won't no longer exist. Kill or be killed!
Crushing all you've got into disappearance,
Remember it's just you and me tonight! Kill or be killed!

"VIOLENCE" is forced upon thee, surrender your free will you gonna die!
"SUFFERING" pure terror will await you, dare it bastard I will make you cry!
"ARROGANCE" Keep away from me, "VIOLENCE" you will receive,
"PESTILENCE" all on thee, Suffer all the pain, you gonna die!
