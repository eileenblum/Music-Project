[Music: Scholz / Lyrics: Gonnella]

Party like a devil in delirium, run like a maniac to strike,
Stripping off and wonder fast like a thunder, it's time to celebrate the feast of crime.

NO(explanation) FEAR (of nothing), feeling til the end,
The wild hordes are on the move again.

Standing next to some fantastic terrorists, I'll pull my gun and shoot 'em down,
If I would miss I would be so pissed, so I shoot over and over again.

NO (explanation) FEAR (of nothing), feeling til the end,
The wild hordes are on the move again.
ALL (always) TIL (to be) friends until the end,
We have no fear good friends until the end

Beat up, get beaten up, stand up when you are under attack
Hurry haste, never look back, they are just in front the good old pack

ALL (always) TIL (to be) friends until the end,
We have no fear good friends until the end

We have no fear good friends until the end
[Solo: Michael]
Beat up, get beaten up, stand up when you are under attack

Sitting on a plane which is going down the drain, in free fall I ough to decide,
Should I remember my time in September, fuck it man I will survive this crash

NO (explanation) FEAR (of nothing), feeling til the end,
The wild hordes are on the move again.
ALL (always) TIL (to be) friends until the end,
We have no fear good friends until the end
