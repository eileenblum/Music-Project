[Music: Scholz / Hoffmann / Sondermann / Kremer - Lyrics: Gonnella]

Fire and death in Bohan City, the control of each turf is battled with guns,
A gang of fully armed assassins, lead the attack on your turf, but you'll never give up,
Mexican standoff celebration, either you or him will continue to live
Blast the rocket launcher into the foe, huge explosions all around, a big battle is to be won
GTA5 / will you survive

Grab the Russian rifle AK-47, hijack the car as fast as you can,
Haste to the turf to which is under attack, prevent the take over with all that you've got,
With a sniper on the top of a crane, a clean head shot, shoot another to be save,
Hear the shotgun load behind your back, the opponents are here and that's a fact.
GTA5 / will you survive

Turf War is the total war with the weapons of death
Shot to kill is the aim, defend all turfs the same,
It's big time tonight, are you ready for the fight?
Ruthless and cold here no one gets old

The M16 shoots to kill, total action all around three attackers were killed,
A grenade explodes in front of you, you've got hit not so bad, you need help from your crew.
Sneaking around in front the turf, if they see you first you are dead it's a curse,
Try to hide well behind the big wall, when your targets come you will kill 'em all.
GTA5 / will you survive
GTA5 / it's another life

Turf War is the total war with the weapons of death
Shot to kill is the aim, defend all turfs the same,
It's big time tonight, are you ready for the fight?
Ruthless and cold here no one gets old
