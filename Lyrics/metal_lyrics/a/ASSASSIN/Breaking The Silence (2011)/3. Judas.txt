[Music: Hoffmann - Lyrics: Gonnella]

Judas! Your fight is over, the truth despises the lie,
Revenge is sweet, declare defeat go burn in hell and die!
A tragic life, a liars fate, terrorized and forced to crawl,
Scream for mercy; beg for your life, it's time to burn your soul.

Traumatized, tired, exhausted, tormented and sedated,
A cheaters fate with all the hollows, no god, no hope, just hated!

Judas, Judas, betrayed, deceived and tossed,
There is no escape the traitor must die, burned and nailed to the cross!

[Solo: Michael / Scholli / Michael / Scholli]

Betrayer! Rotten to the core with a bright smile in their eyes,
Break a promise, suffer your scum, cause you will pay the price!
No secondary chances for the guilty parasite, fatal, false, insane,
Pray for your death you treacherous traitor, 'cause you will die in pain!

Traumatized, tired, exhausted, tormented and sedated,
A cheaters fate with all the hollows, no god, no hope, just hated!

Judas, Judas, betrayed, deceived and tossed,
There is no escape the traitor must die, burned and nailed to the cross!
