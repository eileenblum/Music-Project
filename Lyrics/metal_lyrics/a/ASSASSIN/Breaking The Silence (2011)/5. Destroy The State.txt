[Music: Scholz / Lyrics: Gonnella]

You want me to contribute, all I've got is one for you,
Paying taxes, interests and social funds, you can kiss my ass you scum,

Destroy the state, destroy it and burn in down

Imprisoned, no freedom with your censorship,
Stop the brainwash, stop this bullshit,
The rules, the laws and regulations,
I'll break 'em all with satisfaction,

Destroy the state, destroy it and burn in down

This is the time, to organize the revolution,
Screams of revenge, we're here to avenge,
The hour is right, we're here for the final fight,
Freedom arrives, the good will survive

[Solo: Michael]

Your love is hate, your freedom is a lie,
You pressure me just one more time,
We're forced to work and that's so sick,
Just bend down and feel my final kick

Destroy the state, destroy it and burn in down

This is the time, to organize the revolution,
Screams of revenge, we're here to avenge,
The hour is right, we're here for the final fight,
Freedom arrives, the good will survive

[Solo: Scholli / Michael]
