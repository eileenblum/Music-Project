[Music: Scholz - Lyrics: Gonnella]

It's okay to be down
To be alone and have no friends
It's alright to think that you're the only like that
Smoking pot, getting drunk
Sniffing cocaine, taking loads of drugs
Try to get away from reality
Searching for peace and never finding it

Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one
Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one

Friends are no friends, friends are no friends, friends are no friends?
Real friends are real friends!

[Solo: Scholli]

The society thinks, that you're a punk and outsider.
This brings you down and the depression is deep and strong.

Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one
Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one

Friends are no friends, friends are no friends, friends are no friends?
Real friends are real friends!

[Solo: Scholli]

You make mistakes, you ain't perfect
You always could be wrong
Ups and downs, laughs and cries
Nothing could tear us apart
Longtime friend, shorttime buddies
Ain't nothing the same,
Experience the long term value,
Nothing higher to reach

My friends are you there
And are you listening to this song?
Life ain't easy to live
But with you it's colourful
Sunshine here, party there
Together we are strong
And don't deny at the very end to be happy
Stands friendship above anything

Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one
Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one

Friends are no friends, friends are no friends, friends are no friends?
Real friends are real friends!
