Wanna have some lovely fun with me
Talking bullocks and ignore reality
Never cool, always highest temperament
Shouting loud and never be silent
Psycho terror
Destroy you like a total war
Concentrate to make you realize
That you're mine and that's so wonderful
It is fun to have me pick on you
The aim to destroy you is so permanent
Psycho terror
Destroy you like total war
Calling midnight over and over again
See you scared is such a pleasure
Wow, cannot stop my extreme aggressive mind
To terrorize you makes me calm and bad
Psycho terror
Destroy you like a total war
Psycho terror
I destroy you like a total war
