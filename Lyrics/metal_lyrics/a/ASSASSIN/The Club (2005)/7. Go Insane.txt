I live in the heavens
Walking on the bright side
Up and up I go
Further to the top
It's another elevation
My ideas of a peaceful life
To pick up to pick up
Don't wanna go insane
Just don't wanna go insane
Don't wanna go insane
The way my mind freaks me
Let's go
I am the eternal spirit
So take what it takes from the wicked
Going insane the pain does not get away
The time is ticking
I find the above solution
To clear me of all that pollution
Going insane the pain does not get away
'Cause I go insane in my brain
Go insane, go insane, go insane
Every day I loosen my moral behaviours
I dance on my profits and your losses
Going insane the pain does not get away
The bomb exploded
