Back on the streets again
Ready for the action
Our wear is very casual
Don't wanna draw any attention
Looking for opponents
Hiding from the sirens
The enemy is spotted
It's our kick here we go again
Come on lad, join the pack
It's a hooligan desire
The bushwhackers are back in town
Making trouble and anarchy
If you think you are hard enough
Join the mob in action
It's always a one on one
No weapons are accepted
Respect your opponents
Listen to your leader
The enemy is spotted
Let's get them all
Here we go again
The bushwhackers are back in town
Making trouble and anarchy

Come on lad, join the pack
It's a hooligan desire
The bushwhackers are back in town
Making trouble and anarchy
