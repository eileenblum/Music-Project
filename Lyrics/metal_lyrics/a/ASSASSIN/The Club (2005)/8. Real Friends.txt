It's okay to be down
To be alone and have no friends
It's alright to think that you're the only like that
Smoking pot, getting drunk
Sniffing cocaine, taking loads of drugs
Try to get away from reality
Searching for peace and never finding it
Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one
Fight this session of self destruction
Get your ass up cause you're not the only one
Friends are no friends
Friends are no friends, just a friend
Real friends are real friends
There are millions like us without a job and having no cash
Thinking the world is going to end with a big boom like that
Awake my friend, you're not alone
Stay on top your dreams and thoughts
I'll be there for you and you for me
Together we are strong and unstoppable
You make mistakes, you ain't perfect
You always could be wrong
Ups and downs laughs and cries
Nothing could tear us apart
Long time friend and short term buddy
Ain't nothing the same experience the long term value
Nothing higher to reach
My friends are you there
And are you listening to this song
Life ain't easy to live
But with you it's colourful
Sunshine here, party there
Together we are strong
And don't deny at the very end to be happy
Stands friendship above anything
