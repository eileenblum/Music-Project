Wednesday, day number one has arrived
The club opens up at 9
Big Klaus is bouncing all around
An extreme fight crowns the night
Thursday night the second day of action
The happy hour is a must
While Friday night comes psycho crazy
Maniacs to turn your face around
All shrinks are insane
The club is in my veins
Morals and values of the crazy minds
The outsider is the society
We tear it off the ground
Hey, hey, join the club of monstrous action
Hey, hey, you may talk to special people
Hey, hey, have some vodka lemon there
Hey, hey, relax in the living room with K2
Saturday, Dr. Oetker's pack attacks
And is rioting for free speech
Hassan, the Morroccan warrior
Goes off to battle with his club
The final day of ravage which lead to total chaos
Is Sunday's holy jazz hour
The holy man Ulf sends his blessings for the world
Peace, hand in hand we dance and shout

We are the anarchist
Fight against the fascists
