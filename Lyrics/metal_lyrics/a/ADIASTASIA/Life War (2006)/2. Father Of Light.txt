Going in the way of madness
Can this mankind go on?
Living illusions and sadness
They don't know what is wrong
Going to the dark abyss, loosing time, going die
Waiting just their destiny, learning lies, all the time

Angels in darkness are waiting
Right the evil time
This world is under the evil
And this angels lies
Waiting for miracles, claiming a savior
They don't know Jesus

He's the way, he's the savior of this world
He's alive, he's the greatest miracle of the lord
He's the father of light, he's the way, the truth, the life
