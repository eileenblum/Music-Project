All this time you have waiting for your destiny
Now the signs of the time are running, we'll see the glory
Hey, what are you waiting to understand?
See the kingdom of glory comming soon to remake the history

Now it's the time of wait to the horn sound

Angels fighting together , humans day by day
Asking mercy in the silence for the mission of the warriors
Hey, What are you waiting to understand?
Hear the kingdom of glory calling you to be a Warrior

Now it's the time of wait to the horn sound
Hear the glorious calling to the last of the wars

All that remains until the and shall win the war
Will be the winner of the crown
Go now in the way and you will find your strength to fight
You are the warrior chosen by God to lead your land
