The fellowship

I'v got a dream, I believe in this way
Living my life for a better day
We are light and profets of the land
Fighting together free
We can fly as eagles in the sky
Running against the time

I'v got a king and I live by his grace
I was in darkness but now i'm saved
We are light and profets of the land
Fighting together free
We can fly as eagles in the sky
Running against the time

Fight to still go on
On the way of light
Fight to still go on
On the way of the light
