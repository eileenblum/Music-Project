A mean to the life, the reason of being
Live after die

If we all are here, to live in a dream
Why do we cry?

We walked all wrong in shadows lands
Far from our Lord going to hell
With no hope of a chance to live
No way to fight to save our self

But before we fell in shadows
We could see the light of day
We could hear the call of grace
The freedom call, the freedom call, go on

A dream to live, the reason of dream is:
Fly forever with the wings of light

Now we can dream, now I say
We're alive by the grace
Now we can live to you Lord
By your sacrifice, sacrifice...
