Better than all I feel it
The presence of God inside my heart
There's a change I see
I lost my fear of walk in shadows
Life War!
I see a name, a hero
The real one that saved my life
You know he's name is Jesus
But you are aways running away from
His love
Life War!

When the evil comes I claim to save my life
The name of the hero, lord of heroes Jesus Christ
Son of the man , son of the father of the light
The Adiastasia, perfect glory of the lord, prayse the lord

How can you go in this life , in lies , living in pain?
I know you feel I your heart some one, calling your name

Show you adiastasia
Look to adiastasia
Show you adiastasia
Look to adiastasia

If you're loosing the life war
I can guide you to victory
I show adiastasia
It's the way to the victory

When the evil...
