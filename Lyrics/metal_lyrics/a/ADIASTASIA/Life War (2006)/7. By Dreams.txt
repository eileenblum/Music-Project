A light in the dark I see
The reason of being
The answer to all my prayers
My promessed land
I know what I'm waiting for
Just what I am

By dreams I live all my life
By dreams I will live forever
A scream of victory now
I know it will be forever
For beyond the time

I was in my darkest time
With no hope to see again
The face that I sow some day
Just what I am
I know what I'm waiting for
Just what I am
A memory of the childhood time
A kid with a toy in the hands
The friends that I left behind
My never land
I know what I'm waiting for
Just what I am
By dreams...
