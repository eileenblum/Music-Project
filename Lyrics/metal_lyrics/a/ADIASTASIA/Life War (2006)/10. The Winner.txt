After the war, I'm feeling so tired
Can hear the the voice, in the silence calling
Inside of me, my soul weep's the crime
The sins of the mankind, this Life War
The war inside

Many tears I cried, but now I see the way of light
I can see the winner's prise
The strength return's to me

Torments I passed, but now I feel the peace of mind
Jesus lead me to the light
Can make the same to... your Life
