He's the way, he's comming back
And I know how short is the time
To pray for you and every one
To give you the true and the life

See will come the great new day
Forever no more pain
And every one that believe in his name
Will live the eternal life

Now it's time to believe
To fly to be free

Heroes die by heroes hands
All brave and falling in the land
Victimes of the reality
Bliden by the lord of this century

They don't hear the freedom call
Don't see the sign of the light
Jesus Gave the chance for all
To live the eternal life

Now it's time...

Time to open the sea, to find the way of the life
Miracles will make you fell
Faith born in you heart
