I walk among the building, of a city with no name,
Unknown faces, empty face, identities fade away,
Fills my heart with hatred, fills my heart with hate,
The dark man has came, positive feelings have been slain,

SLAIN...

There's no more hope for this world, despair is what remains,
A rotting core called this earth, the maggots, these are we,
One thing that keeps me going, the misanthrope in me,
And as we walk among the buildings, I kiss my friend called HATE,

HATE...

Emptiness,
Bitterness,
Apathy,
Is what will be
