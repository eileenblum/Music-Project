Ripped up, torn apart inside
Iâve been burned too many times
You shouldâve thought twice on this one
But youâre not the thinking type

You better know where to run
Know where to hide
Donât hold your breath
Look alive!

âCause Iâm coming closer with every step
Do you feel me breathing down your neck?
I wonât tell you again, I donât give a fuck if you understand!
My heavy, my calloused hand will find you, boy, and make you a man

Strap in for the ride of your life
Break into pieces in the limelight
Lie like Iâm right, canât seem to find
Nothing but wrong

You better know where to run
Know where to hide
Donât hold your breath
Look alive!

âCause Iâm coming closer with every step
Do you feel me breathing down your neck?
I wonât tell you again, I donât give a fuck if you understand!
My heavy, my calloused hand will find you, boy, and make you a man
