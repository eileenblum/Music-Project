Can you tell me what Iâm looking for?
Can you tell me what Iâm searching for?

Sleep on the streets where I walk in the dark
And I lived with a heavy heart
Go wherever I choose to go when I roam
And I know that thereâs no train headed for home

New southern
I live this way
Going straight to hell on a rainy day
A new southern
âCause I live this way

Lost my head on the way to get help
With the hand that I dealt myself
Fuck! I canât help about the way I felt
But sometimes I even disgust myself

New southern
I live this way
Going straight to hell on a rainy day
A new southern
âCause I live this way
