If there was a time and that time is now
Time for you to walk away and shut your fucking mouth
Well, you face the smoking gun
Are you feeling lucky, son?
Bounced a check you could not cash
Fucked up bad, fell on your ass
Fell on your ass! Yeah!

Give up, give in
Best be on your way
Timeâs up!
Commence kicking rocks down the path to pain

Give up, give in
If your ever walk my way
Timeâs up!
Commence kicking rocks down the path to pain

If there was a time, a time to back down
Time for you to walk away, no sense in dying now
You wonder when Iâm done
When itâs fucking bloody, son
Take a breath, savor your last
Fucked up bad, fell on your ass
Fell on your ass! Yeah!

Give up, give in
Best be on your way
Timeâs up!
Commence kicking rocks down the path to pain

Give up, give in
If your ever walk my way
Timeâs up!
Commence kicking rocks down the path to pain

Kicking rocks down the path to pain
My path to pain
