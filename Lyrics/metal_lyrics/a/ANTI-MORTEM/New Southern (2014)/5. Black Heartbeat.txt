Used and abused, heart-breaking news
To live a lie and watch you die
Choking on your words

Itâs safe to say itâs over now
At least until you call
Sometimes Iâve wondered why I cared
Or loved you at all

Go on and pretend that itâs not your fault
Your cold black heartbeat has come to a halt

So use me and abuse me
To get what you need
Confuse me, lie to me
Your damage has been done
You canât take advantage of my love anymore
No trust, no honesty
Then just walk out the door

When I see you out, I keep my pace
My cold black eyes wipe that smile right off your face
You know that it hurts âcause you made me this way
But if you died tomorrow, well, Iâd spit on your grave

Go on and pretend that itâs not your fault
Your cold black heartbeat has come to a halt

So use me and abuse me
To get what you need
Confuse me, lie to me
Your damage has been done
You canât take advantage of my love anymore
No trust, no honesty
Then just walk out the door

Use me and abuse me
To get what you need
Confuse me, lie to me
Your damage is done

So use me and abuse me
To get what you need
Confuse me, lie to me
Your damage has been done
You canât take advantage of my love anymore
No trust, no honesty
Then just walk out the door

No trust, no honesty
