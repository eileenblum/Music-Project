Retaliate! Riot! Revolutionize!
We can no longer stand idly by...
Rebel against this devil or meet you demise
How much can we give till we realize?

Read the signs
Weâre out of time
Today we rise
Join or die!

We took all we will take
Our hate is American made
City to city, state to state
Our rage is American made

Rage!

Annihilate! Destroy! Demoralize!
Read between the lines and donât believe their lies
Revel in your evil, their all seeing eye
How much can they take, youâre out of your mind

Read the signs
Weâre out of time
Youâre in this fight
So choose your side
Today we rise
Join or die!

We took all we will take
Our hate is American made
City to city, state to state
Our rage is American made

Our rage is American made
Our rage is American made
Our rage is American made
Our rage is American made!

We took all we will take
Our hate is American made
City to city, state to state
Our rage is American made

We took all we will take
Our hate is American made
City to city, state to state
Our rage is American made!
