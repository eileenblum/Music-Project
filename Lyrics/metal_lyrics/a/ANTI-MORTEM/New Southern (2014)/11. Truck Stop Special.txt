The first time I saw it
It happened so fast
I didnât turn the other way
Although I never stood a chance

You said âdonât waste your life with your head in the sandâ
You said âdonât waste your time, son, on a foolâs errandâ

Well, in this life, the rules you live by
It makes no difference, son, when itâs do or die
Oh! Your stoneâs been weighed, the dye is cast
Your crow has come, judgment is passed, yeah!

But you canât deny the accusations
When you got the red-stained hand
This life is one of temptation
Best walk away while you can

You canât live your life, no, with your head in the sand
You canât waste your time, son, on a foolâs errand, yeah!
On a foolâs errand

Enough money to drown in, enough rope to hang
Troubleâs the way Iâm living, child, but it ainât nothing
Iâll educate you, boy, Iâll show you how to be
To never want nothing, son, and take all you need, yeah!

But you canât deny the accusations
When you got the red-stained hand
This life is one of temptation
Best walk away while you can

You canât live your life, no, with your head in the sand
You canât waste your time, son, on a foolâs errand, yeah!

Well, this life, itâs a dead end street
Cold, dark and lonely, straight fucking mean
A race to the end, whoever gets there last
Suffers from the sorrow of losing all they had...

A foolâs errand
A foolâs errand!
