You sell the words you used to mean
The silver lining on a perfect dream
Descend to stardom, demise to fame
And soon enough, youâll be thrown away...

Youâre in over your head
One false move and youâre dead
Donât want this day to end tragic
Wannabe wants to be me
I switch off the safety
Youâve entered the mind of a madman

Fully-loaded automatic
Hate automatic
Fully-loaded automatic
Hate automatic

Iâm the fuel, the igniter
Youâre the fool in the fire

What a slap in the face
The only word is âDisgracedâ
Iâve gone beyond the point of pissed
A disease that sticks to me
I canât shake the feeling
Somebody put you up to this

Fully-loaded automatic
Hate automatic
Fully-loaded automatic
Hate automatic

Iâm the fuel, the igniter
Youâre the fool in the fire
Iâm the fuel, the igniter
Youâre the fool, youâre the fool!

Hell-stained thoughts in my brain
We are not one, weâre not the same! No!
You stole my life, youâll share my pain
You stole my love, now feel my hate!

Fully-loaded automatic
Hate automatic

Iâm the fuel, the igniter
Youâre the fool in the fire
Iâm the fuel, the igniter
Youâre the fool, youâre the fool!

Hate automatic
