I know your face, Iâve seen it once before
Your twisted truth lies behind closed doors

But weâre not blind
We can open your eyes and...

Wake up
Rise up
Donât be afraid to
Stand up
Speak up
Show us your face

Liars, leaders, kings, deceivers
Theyâre all the same
We gave you your power
We can take it away
Away!

Give us a reason not to riot in the streets
Give us a voice and set your people free

Lock their closed doors
Throw away the key
We can open our eyes
We can learn how to see and...

Wake up
Rise up
Donât be afraid to
Stand up
Speak up
Show us your face

Liars, leaders, kings, deceivers
Theyâre all the same
We gave you your power
We can take it away!

The wars that weâve been losing
The wrong paths that weâve been choosing
Every answer that theyâve made
More questions now replace
If we keep waiting on
Them to change the song
Will wake up one day...
And realize itâs too late!

Wake up
Rise up
Donât be afraid to
Stand up
Speak up
Show us your face

Liars, leaders, kings, deceivers
Theyâre all the same
We gave you your power
We can take it away!

Rise up!
Stand up!
Speak up!
Wake up!
