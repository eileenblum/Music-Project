I was told my whole life âdonât do this, donât do thatâ
Force your opinion on me like it was fact
You tried to hypnotize and teach me to act
The truth is you lied and thereâs no going back

You wonder whatâs under, whatâs underneath my skin
You wonder what gets under, underneath my...

I see no reason why we should lay down and die
No words of wisdom
I see no reason why we should lay down and die
No words of wisdom

You were told get on your knees and pray every night
To the man who says that he will make it alright
So many words and not a damn one was wise
And Iâm left with nothing but the nothing inside

You wonder whatâs under, whatâs underneath my skin
You wonder what gets under, underneath my...

I see no reason why we should lay down and die
No words of wisdom
I see no reason why we should lay down and die
No words of wisdom

You wonder whatâs under, whatâs under my skin
You wonder whatâs under, underneath my skin
You wonder what gets under, underneath my skin!

I see no reason why we should lay down and die
No words of wisdom
I see no reason why we should lay down and die
No words of wisdom

No words of wisdom
No words of wisdom
