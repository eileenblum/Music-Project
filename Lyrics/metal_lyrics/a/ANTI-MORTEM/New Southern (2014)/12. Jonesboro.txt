Walking down that road from Jonesboro
And Iâm the meanest S.O.B. that youâll ever know
South bound traffic, âcanât I just hitch a ride?â
âYeah! Iâm headed that way, boy! Jump inside!â

All the things you say about all the things you do
Itâs about time to put you down, I swear Iâll see it through

âGet in or Iâll confess your sins with this gun
That Iâm holding to the back of your head!â
I said, âYou best just drive on to Jonesboro!
âCause Iâm the meanest son of a bitch youâll ever know!â

No matter what you think
Nothing youâve heard is true
Itâs a bad joke and youâre the clown
Theyâre laughing right at you

âGet in or Iâll confess your sins with this gun
That Iâm holding to the back of your head!â
I said, âYou best just drive on to Jonesboro!
âCause Iâm the meanest son of a bitch youâll ever know!â
