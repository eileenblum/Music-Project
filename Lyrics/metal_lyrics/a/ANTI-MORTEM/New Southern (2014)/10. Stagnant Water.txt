Rotten body swinging from a tree
Gunshot wound cleaned in a salt-filled sea
Cut throat dead on a blood red sun
In the right hand of God...is a gun

Full moon overhead
A good night to bury your dead
Your body aches as the night closes in
Waves crash down, thereâs death in the wind

Stagnant water in your veins
A gunshot ends your pain
Lifeless men in the riverbed
Stagnant water turns blood red

How long can I live this disease?
How long will it imprison me?
Rubbed raw, so now I can bleed
Leave them here to suffer with me

Stagnant water in your veins
A gunshot ends your pain
Lifeless men in the riverbed
Stagnant water turns blood red

The blood pours and flows in streams
Stench of death blows in with the breeze
Bullet hits so you lay your head
On the bloody mouth of the riverbed

Stagnant water in your veins
A gunshot ends your pain
Lifeless men in the riverbed
Stagnant water turns blood red

Gather round the whipping pole, boy
Take their turns at beating you down
Grit your teeth, you feel it coming
Just some more meat to pound

Begging does you no good
We turned a deaf ear to your pleas
Sober life that you fear, itâs coming
Without the chance of being free

Break! Break!
Break these damn chains
