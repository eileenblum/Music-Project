On a night of the full moon
A blood-pact we all signed
To fall upon the monastery
With violence in our minds
Invading their holy temple
The enemy is at hand
Arisen from a slumber
We attack them while unmanned

We strike them down with sharpened blades
And whip their flesh till it bleeds
We leave their dismembered corpses around
As a message to take heed

Kill them all on sight
By painful means they'll die
For we must keep this planet clean
Of the Christian disease
