Faceless creatures of the light
Humanity burning deep within their hearts
Weakened beings all frozen in fear
Staring into demon eyes

The worthless children of God
Visions of their painful deaths
Tortured by the legion of the mighty Balors

Lifeforms extinguished from this earth
By these forces of evil
Dissension from the heavenly realm
To a kingdom of hate and torment

Screams ignite all Christian flesh
Screams unite in a chorus of pain
The faithful of the crucified one are defleshed by the Tanar'ri forces

The formation of the Blood War dividing all alignments
Victims of the church face the terrors of the Abyss
Conviction of the feeble ones, so pitiful in their sight
Slaughter of the lesser race
Their souls damned into hell

Diabolic creatures of death
Messengers of eternal pain
Delivering us from peace and unto an endless war
Eliminating their species far from our sight
The demonic souls of hell taste victory at last
