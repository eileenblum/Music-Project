Tortured by the servants of light till death countless aeons ago
Summoned forth by evil spells to rule over all of Oerth
Fully adorned with rotting flesh
Ruler of the mighty Graz'zt
Blackened demon, warrior of hell
Being sent forth to cleanse this land

Knight of the living dead

Granted with a magic sword to sever endless limbs from flesh
In search of the Final Key buried beneath the Ashen Desert
Through the City Out of Mind to join the artefact of three
Silent white beings scathe the halls of a place lost long ago

Knight of the living dead

All Theoparts he does possess
Rejoined to the horror of all
The skies turn black above the forming mist
As he rises from the grave

Scathing Oerik, perishing life
Destroying the weak and feeble beings
From the mountainous Pennor Hills
To the woods of the Inferno Peaks

OUR forces grow in strength
ARMIES of hate without remorse
WILLingly they kill and fight
ARISE creatures of the night
