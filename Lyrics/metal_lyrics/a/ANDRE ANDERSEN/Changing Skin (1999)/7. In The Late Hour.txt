[Bonus track]

I've been up, I've been down
Bigger stuff couln't kick me around
So you can drop your illusions and hopes
About making me cold

I've been low, I've been high
Tell me, while I was learning to fly
Were you feeding your bitch with the gold paid
For your friends whom you sold?

Can't you understand? I watch your bridges burning
Snake around my hand just bit again

I'm your smile and I'm your tear
I'm your pleasure, I'm your fear
When you're down on the floor
I'm your master, I'm your slave
I'm the one who you've betrayed
Nothing is real and it never will be like before
I'm your freedom, I'm your drug
I'm your shadow in the dark
Nowhere to hide or to run anymore
I'm your shame and I'm your pride
Now I'm leaving you behind
Waiting for my pain to knock on your door

You can roll, you can crowl
I think Biff's kind of said it all
"You're getting rid of the deadly desease
By cutting it right out"
I guess you make your point
Selling friends for the shiny coin
You can cheat, you can lie - can you die
And make your maker proud?
