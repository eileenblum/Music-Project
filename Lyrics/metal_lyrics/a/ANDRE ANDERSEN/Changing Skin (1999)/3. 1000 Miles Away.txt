The echo of "goodbye" got poisoned by the lie:
"I'll never let you go"
The shadow of your smile is gone, I wonder why
But now I'll never know
Let the river flow to the place where sorrow grows
No, I just can't let you go!

1000 miles away - can you hear me calling when I see you cry
1000 miles away - wasted days are passing by
You're 1000 miles away

Another day, another place, another scar across my face
At least it's something new
You've disappeared - I'm left behind, about to lose my mind
I had my faith in you
Let the river flow to the place which I will never know
No, I just can't let you go

1000 miles away - can you hear me calling when I see you cry
1000 miles away - wasted days are passing by
1000 miles away - while the sun is shining river's running dry
1000 miles away - I never cared to say goodbye
