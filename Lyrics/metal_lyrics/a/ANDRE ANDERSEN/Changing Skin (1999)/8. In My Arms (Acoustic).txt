[Bonus track]

How can I tell what's on my mind right now, while you'releaving
If I could catch you final breath and never stop believing
If I could pray this pain away...

You're in my arms - if I could wish you back
You're in my arms - my world is turning black
You're in my arms - just let me take your pain
You're in my arms - I'm crying out your name

I saw that fear behind your stare, that hope to see tomorrow
It breaks my heart 'cos now you're gone - I wish that I couldfollow
And make you stay just one more day
