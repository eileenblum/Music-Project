I told you once, I told you twice
That you can't live on compromise - but you won't listen
Another time, another place
It's like a neverending race and there's no reason
To waste your life away in one single day

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Man with the scythe - he is coming for you
Stage is the same but some faces are new
Why can't you see that it's over?

I pulled you up, you let me down
I'm sick of dragging you around - it feels like forever
I'm going left, you're going right
Out of my life, out of my sight - it's now or never
Go waste your life away in one single day

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Man with the scythe - he is pointing at you
Stage is the same but some faces are new
Why can't you see that it's over?

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Listen, I'm trying to tell you that
Time's running out, God, but we never knew
Night's getting cold and your story is old - it's been told

I let you in, I turned you loose
I gave you lot's of time to choose to change the story
You are the snake around my hand
The one who used to be my friend - and now you're sorry
I've suffered all the way - you will today
Go, waste your life away in one single day

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Man with the scythe - he is coming for you
Stage is the same but some faces are new
Why can't you see that it's over?

Bridges are burning and chances are few
Waiting is over and this is your cue
Time's running out, God, but you never knew
Listen, I'm trying to tell you
