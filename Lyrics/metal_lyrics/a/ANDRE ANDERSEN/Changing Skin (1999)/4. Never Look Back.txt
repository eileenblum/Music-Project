You can break my heart, you can rape my soul
Tear my life apart, push me until I'll fall
Step by step, day by day, now it's time to break away

Never look back - while you can hear my call
Never look back - until the final curtain'll fall
Never look back - now you can leave it all
Never look back - just leave and never come back

You can tell me lies, you can waste my "bread"
Only in my eyes you're as good a dead
Tear by tear, laugh by laugh, now I think I've had enough
