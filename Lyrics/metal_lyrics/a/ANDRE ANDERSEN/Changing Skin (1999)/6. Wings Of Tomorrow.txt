I'm walking the streets of blooming despair and regret
Kid in the alley is pressing the gun to his head
Is he right, is he wrong, is he weak, is he strong
Was he fighting alone - on his own?

Rain's falling down and I pray - take all his pain and his sorrow
I wish he could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow
Rain's falling down and I pray - show my the way and I'll follow
Take me and fly me away on the wings of tomorrow

I'm closing the door to the room full of sorrow and rage
Girl in the window in tears sliding over the edge
Is she right, is she wrong, is she weak, is she strong
Was she fighting alone - on her own?

Rain's falling down and I pray - take all her pain and her sorrow
I wish she could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow
Rain's falling down and I pray - show me the way and I'll follow
Take my and fly my away on the wings of tomorrow

Am I right, am I wrong, am I weak, am I strong
Am I fighting alone - on my own?

Rain's falling down and I pray - take all my pain and my sorrow
I wish I could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow
Rain's falling down and I pray - show me the way and I'll follow
Take me and fly me away on the wings of tomorrow
