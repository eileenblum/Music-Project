How can I tell what's on my mind right now, while you're leaving
If I could catch you final breath and never stop believing
If I could pray this pain away...

You're in my arms - if I could wish you back
You're in my arms - my world is turning black
You're in my arms - just let me take your pain
You're in my arms - I'm crying out your name

I saw that fear behind your stare, that hope to see tomorrow
It breaks my heart 'cos now you're gone - I wish that I could follow
And make you stay just one more day
I'm going down, someone please help me
Out of this world - nobody hears me
I close my eyes praying for you
But nobody cares even when I do
Scream my head off and cry my wounded heart out
Who gives a damn about one voice in the crown
I'll give everything, even those very few
Days of my life which I have left - to you
