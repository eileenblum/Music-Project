Cold. The night is crawling, surrounding every corner of our lives
Wait - somebody's waiting for you to close your eyes...

Sleep. Whole world's asleep. I hear the darkness rising from the deep
Deep, a lake so deep, reflecting every star you've ever seen.
Time flies. Better open up your eyes - you're living in the desperate times

Pain. I'm used to pain, it leads me through the neverending rain
Rain, that heartless rain won't wash my sins and helpless tears away
But I know - now it's time to hold the line

'Coz I'll live, yes I'll live
I'll cross the sea of madness on the wave of disbelief
Countless miles through the lies
A wind of change will take me far away from our desperate times,
Those lonely times

Gone. Forever gone my sense of time, I've lost it on the run
Run, I've always run from everything I've seen an' done
But now... Now it's time to draw the line, time to hold the line

'Coz I'll live, yes I'll live
I'll cross the sea of madness on the wave of disbelief
Countless miles through the lies
A wind of change will take me far away from our desperate days
Faceless days, lonely days
Keep pushing me around and leaving scars across my face
In my eyes our live's a neverending struggle to escape
From our desperate times.
