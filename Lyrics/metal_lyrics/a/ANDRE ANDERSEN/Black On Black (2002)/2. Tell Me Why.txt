Can't figure out the stuff you're telling me. Whatever, I don't care
Is it another way of showing me what hides behind your stare?
Whatever drives you -I don't wanna know, I saw it all before
I'm moving up and leaving you below, so keep your stupid war

No one remembers when it's all begun, but I won't rack my brain
To understand why every bit of fun you're turning into pain -
I don't know. No matter what you want - I'm checking out, ain't coming back again
I wish you luck - without me around, I got a better plan

Tell me why can't I settle for less,
Tell me why am I running ahead of the rest

Tell me why all this hell of a mess,
Tell me why can't I settle for a little bit less?
