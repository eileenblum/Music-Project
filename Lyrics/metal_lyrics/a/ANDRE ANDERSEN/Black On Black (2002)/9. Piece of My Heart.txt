Everyday, all night long I keep on wondering 'bout what went wrong
Was I blessed, was I cursed? It doesn't matter, but what made it burst?
Whatever put me down - It hit me hard, you know, so hard
It took my breath away and now it broke my heart

Tell me what turns you on, what makes you drill my every single bone?
Now you win, an' I lost. I waste my time around this evil ghost
Whatever gets you high - it's tearing me apart so hard
But I don't wanna know what made you break my heart

Now I'm turning away. In die end of the day
As I'm looking behind, pass the enemy line
While the smoke disappears - you're alone with your tears,
And a new day's begun, but there's nowhere to run
All your fences are up as they were from the start,
So while I'm moving away, there's only one thing to say:

Doesn't matter who's fault - if you're still standing tall
Or you're falling apart - you can keep a little piece of my heart.
