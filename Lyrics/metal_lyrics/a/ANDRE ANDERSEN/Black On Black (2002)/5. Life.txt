Years of rejections and years of regrets, years of unbearable guilt,
Years of creating a dream life could never fulfill
Days of forgiveness and days of no trust toss me around like a toy
Days which will make me forget even seconds of joy

While pain is cutting like a knife I'm trying hard to reinvent
My life - all my life

Left in a cell with a window so small - barely feeling the sun
Sneaking the light on my skin. But my struggle's begun.
Pushing aside every shadow of fear, lifting myself from the ground,
Throwing the glove in the face of what's holding me down

While pain is working with it's knife I'm trying hard to reinvent
The rest - the bits and pieces of my life.
