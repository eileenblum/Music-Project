Sorrow, you are my friend on a day like this
I hope tomorrow will never come to see my tears
I feel the heat's getting closer to me

Shadows are getting darker in my hands
The sun Is fighting to find a brighter shade of gray,
But I'm a man with a mission tonight

I'm painting black on black all over the world
All my future, all your past
I'm fighting colors with a brush as my sword
Through every single day until my last
I'm changing seasons to the state of my soul -
Now you see them, now they're gone
I'm painting black on black all over the world
Znd I won't stop until my work is done.
