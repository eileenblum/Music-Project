Wall of fear surrounds you every night, while you're asleep
Pain within won't let you go, won't let you take a deep breath
It's everything - a shelter in your heart,
Last resort of sanity before it falls apart

Leave all your fears, let them rule on the island of tears
Who'll make you stay if you feel like today is the day
To sail away

Rise above your nightmare. You've been down, now make it pay
Step on every piece and let It bleed - now turn away.
