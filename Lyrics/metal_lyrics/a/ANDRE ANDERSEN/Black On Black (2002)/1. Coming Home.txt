I'm heading back from years of repressing the thought
How was I wrong pretending to be who I'm not
Feels like being alone too long,
Chasing dreams on my own - I'm coming home

This time around it's perfectly clear in my mind
Along the way -I know what to lose, what to find
Being stranded and lost too long,
Now I'm moving along - I'm coming home
