We are the dead,
The lost and forgotten.
Failing bodies on a dying earth
In need of something more.

Why do we cry out?
Why do we cry out to nothing?
No sign in the stars,
An abandoned body gone cold without Your presence.

We are the children of widowed mothers.
Worn and in need of rest,
We are finished.

Don't forget how we've suffered and have been disgraced.
We must never lose sight.

Not knowing if we can ever find peace or happiness,
the dark abyss in our hearts is our only true home.
