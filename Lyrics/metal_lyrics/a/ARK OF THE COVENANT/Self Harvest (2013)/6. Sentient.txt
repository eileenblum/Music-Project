I never received your first name but I'd love to curse it.
You're using my Father's name as if it's worthless.

Injustice,
Do you realize the disease you spread?
Do you realize the disease spewing from your mouth?
Do you know the name you curse at all?

Why do you speak this way?
Does this world own you?

Tell me how you find this appropriate,
I don't understand.
Why does your tongue cut your maker?

Never sentient,
Our lives are a disgrace.
We are a disgrace.
