Blind.
Open your eyes.
What does the world look like from the back of your eye lids?
What is this life to you in your own little mind?

Have you ever stepped out into the light?
This is a message for all the blind men who falsely shine their example of Godliness;
Open your eyes tonight.

Take these words to the grave.
We'll see what comes from the harvest.
