you're a liar
you're a fake

lighter fluid comes to mind when you say that you live like Christ
will you realize what you claim when there's fire in the sky (so)
tell me how you live your life
your meaningless,pathetic life
tell me how you live your life
your meaningless life

admit you're a liar
admit you're a fake

who are you trying to convince
(you're a fake)
I've seen no fruits from you
(you're a fake)
fess up and tell the truth
(you're a fake)
that you are not a servant of God
(you're a fake)
Im burning down
your falsehood
step up and show your heart or admit
or admit you're a fake

admit you're a liar
admit you're a fake
