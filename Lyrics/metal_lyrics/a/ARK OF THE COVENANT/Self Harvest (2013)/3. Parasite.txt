[feat. Tom Hirst Of Creations]Parasite, making women cry for twenty four years.
What a wasted life.
Where is your mind?
Parasite, where is my brother now?
Lying child I'm so sick of you.
Who are you tonight?

You've been saying that you're Christ-like
When your life says nothing of the sort.

You should shift the tears from her eyes to yours.
Can you show compassion?

Do you like hearing yourself speak?
Do you know what you've become?
Selfish, careless, ignorant, now silent.
Your life is damned.

Will you find your way out of your selfish state?
