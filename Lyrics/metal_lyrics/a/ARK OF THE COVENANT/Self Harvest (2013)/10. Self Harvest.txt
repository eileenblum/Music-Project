I lay in this bedridden state,
The passage of time slowing.
A prayer of peace before I depart...

One last breath.

Light dissolves as this world fades.
I escape into my thoughts.
The distant memories of better times bring tears to my eyes.

Trapped in this bleak room.
A gallery of mechanical life,
Incremental survival.

I watch as time begins to cease.
I watch as time collapses.

Overlooking the past, the moments spent on earth,
What fruits have I labored for?
What crops have I sown?

The prayers, the service,
It has all come down to this.
I've done the best I can.
Made His holy purpose my only mission.

His fire surrounds this heart slowly beating.
This is the final harvest of my life.
