Pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
In pursuit of an atonement that will never come.
You justify your actions, the excuse of false claims.

Sinking beneath the hope of release,
You've built this prison, brick by bloody brick.

Who is the man behind the mask,
The brother I loved?
The person I once looked up to?
Is he lost within?

We're left with nothing but a debt on our hands.
A broken family, the legacy you've left behind.

Face the demon
Or perish as a promise unfulfilled.
You were meant for more than this.
An absent figure, an abandoned home,
You were meant for more than this.

Set flames to this withered field.
These crops are all worthless.
