Transgressors,
The unholy ones who have taken our God out of context.
Over-pious fools.

Wolves lurk in our pastures
Taking haste on a false pretense.
With worthless words you spew your hate.
Our Lord will take you like a thief in the night.

False prophets -- Deceitful men of faith.
What God do you pray to that would let you commit these crimes without consequence?

We are the mourners of buried soldiers and fallen children,
You have no power here.

Can't you see what's been done to these families or are you really that blind?

We are here to speak for the silenced.
Let the buried be at peace.
