its been a few days and I cant sleep
just thinking of my life in this world
and Im praying over things that might not even matter
but I need your strength
you see I just cant do this on my own
my brothers abandonment and the hate I wanna feel
and the loneliness I do feel
even with brothers by your blood
and sitting around starting to think
whats worth living for beyond praising you
because nothing else brings joy to me
peace that I even feel in my bones
and where dose that heart ache go
when I just open my mouth
and then I lift up my eyes
and sing unto the only one who matters here
the only one deserving of praise
the only one who fixes all these broken bones
the only one who restores lives in this world
lives once lost,lives once lost

And we will sing praises to you Lord
and we will sing praises unto you
for you are the only one who matters,matters
