He will come to the Earth
and must judge for his name sake
Don't you know that there's a God
who takes your life and satisfies
but if you live for this world
your dying soul it can only
Die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't want...
you should know
this world is temporary
use your life
to serve one God
His judgment is
purely righteous
please heed these words
for it is soon coming
consider this
your warning
his judgment
is soon coming
please heed these words
his judgment is soon coming
please heed these words
his judgment is soon coming
please heed these words
his judgment is soon coming
please heed these words
his judgment is soon coming
God is Just
God is Holy
God is Just
God is Holy
I am is righteously angered
I am is righteously angered
Set this world on fire
Set it all to flames
Set this world on fire
Set it all to flames
Set this world on fire
Set it all to flames
Set this world on fire
consider it your Judgment
