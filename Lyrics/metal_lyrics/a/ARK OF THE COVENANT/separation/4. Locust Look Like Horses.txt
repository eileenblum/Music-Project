Behold
your destruction
Behold
your condemnation
You know
your worlds peril
And This was made
by your hands

Now He must rebuild
This place
for this reason

this is a crude and disasterus place made of brick buildings
and money loving hearts we are not perfect I have to admit
one to live for to die is gain

bow a knee
fall before
thee almighty Lord
rise and fight
this whore
the time is come

And he will destroy then rebuild thee earth

once more when you look at this place
you're of sin nature
now beg for forgiveness
with God as my witness
I will watch all of you

bow a knee
fall before
thee almighty Lord
rise and fight
this whore

Arise and fight I want all of you to stand up
against the lie there is nothing to live for
these sons and saints are giving me a panic
when they don't stand for the Christ they claim

RISE

And I am standing here in a firm belief that there is a war coming that will destroy everything in sight and you shall be speechless and you shall be nameless unless you have built a relationship with God inside

a rise and fight

we face the mockers
we face everyone
we face the liars
we face the thieves

that destroyed your ties
