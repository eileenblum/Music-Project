[feat. Darrell Tauro Of Wrench In The Works]Inking your name with my blood
so you can overcome,this life
and run home,to your home away from home
but a place you know,that makes you whole
so listen close,
I decides where you go,now tell me
why should I write your name on this page
what did you do for my name sake,tell me

kill you with love
I'll watched you die bloody
kill you with love
in restoration
kill you with love
then put the fear into
kill you with love
your creation
kill you with love
unto the Lords glory
kill you with love
its Revalation

he is the only,he is the only
one I love
he is the only,he is the only
Fear I have

and im standing here watching you shake
trembling
so now tell me what are you so afraid of
nothing but one
and with the Holy ghost
dwelling within you
your second life remains
nothing can hurt you
but just in this world
you will die but once
but after the body's dead
then nothing

Nothing
Inking your name with my blood
so you can overcome,this life
and run home,to your home away from home
but a place you know,that makes you whole
so come on home
