Somewhere in Coma Berenices/ Formulas append themselves to fractured theory/
Algid like intellect/ And persistently intractable/ Swirling in ancient
silence, phrases dart throughout/ The interstellar medium/ A vingintillion
syllables/ Cascade as incantations/ The ebullient clouds of godforms/
Puncturing reality, puncturing existence/ Cortices bend and warp/ Under immense
strain/ Proteins for inchoate larvae, extruded like feces.
