The skies bulge/ Swelling, peeling/ As discs blot out all light/ Momentum is
halted/ Armaments pivot and hurl their projectiles in the direction of life/
Celestials swarm over vast distances/ Trails of mucus mark paths through the
devastation/ Drape the shawl of anxiety/ Across the whole of pitiful Gaia/
Envelope this sputtering biosphere/ And immunize the boulder with ancient
genetic toxins/ Flesh upon scythe into tissue (repeat)/ Fire upon blade and
into flesh/ Suffuse this glorified asteroid with lunacy/ Oceans of fluid drip
from the sky/ The lubricant of unseen vessels/ Hidden behind banks of grey
exhaust/ Humming, shuddering cloud shapes/ Warped by the reentry of said ships/
Landmasses liquefy in wave after wave of unforgiving heat.
