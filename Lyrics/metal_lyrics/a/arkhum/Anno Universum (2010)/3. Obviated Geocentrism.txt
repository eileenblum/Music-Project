Vaccinated with vengeance/ In varying stages of decrepitude/ Ruthlessly
shearing herd after human herd/ Through the membrane of the umbilicus/ Past the
illusion of maleficium/ I deny/ I object/ I repulse/ I repudiate/ I recant/ I
divulge/ I expose/ I, the ultra-luminous/ With the antigen of cognizance I
tempt these monastic slugs/ Their guilt reaches far, seeps low and clings deep/
And still it cleaves the reason from my thought/ I deny/ I object/ I repulse/ I
repudiate/ I recant/ I divulge/ I expose/ I, the ultra-luminous.
