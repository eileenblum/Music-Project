His steps are dogged by blight/ Fearful eyes sinking into sockets/ Limbs
disjointed, hollowed bone/ Sewage drips from his fingertips/ Boulevards buckle
under the weight/ Of austere yet cosmic indifference/ Men and gods alike will
know insolence and petulance/ Horizons loom, ominous and vast/ His gaze is
hounded by doom/ And all therein will feel the swoon/ No decay without dismay,
no vocals chords to helplessly bray.
