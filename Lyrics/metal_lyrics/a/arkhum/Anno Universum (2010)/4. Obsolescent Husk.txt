Reconstructing this genome/ Malleable, culpable still/ Reduced to cursory bits
of data/ I am blinking wryly with the iris of lore/ Detached from mine
motherground/ Soul breached as penalty for sentience/ Encapsulated, nay
insulated!/ Soaking the atoms with pain/ Mine heart encased in meteor/ Mine
discontent a distant solar flare/ Synthetic slumber o'er myriad eons in thine
revolving orb/ Mine pallbearers the stars themselves/ Sever/ Reconstituting
their physiology/ Perplexing astral drift/ The exointelligence will not
acquiesce/ Spewing and spurting malaise through my rendition/ Of the homo
automaton/ Spewing and spurting/ Detaching then hatching.
