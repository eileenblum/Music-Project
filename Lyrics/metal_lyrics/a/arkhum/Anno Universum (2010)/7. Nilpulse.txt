I hate you with all the fire/ Of nine thousand throbbing suns/ I loathe you
with all the fury/ Of the vast, dense, dark expanse of space/ I rain shards of
moons upon you/ Terran platitudes drowned out in hail of plasma, acid, bile and
graphite/ These are the cold months/ These are the solstices/ Swelling with
godlessness/ Tendrils encircle the globe/ Tendrils encircle the globe/ Lacerate
the astroamniotic sac/ Leaking matter and immiscibles through the spiritual
margins of existence/ Behold: swarms of microorganisms/ Cybernetic
microorganisms descend/ In tandem with tentacle/ In tandem with tentacles/
Ethereal maws a million in number/ Gnaw portals and cavities in distant planes
of chaos/ Mothers breastfeed apostate embryos/ And goodwill is engulfed by
delusion.
