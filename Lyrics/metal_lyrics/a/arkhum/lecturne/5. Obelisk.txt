The imprint of a willow came to me
Burned and scarred with fires of glee
A tempered steel man followed closely
Offering his assistance to the mighty tree

In the heart of a glorious fir
I recovered a deep-rooted historical blur
It showed me a glen of dismembered pine
And I formed a plan of malevolent design

I tore each man limb from limb
And dug some holes on a curious whim
In reverence I admired what was once grim
And sodden with blood I transcribed this hymn

"The gloom of a sterile seed
Is washed away as the humans bleed."

Till for me
Lilies in the sand
Gather for me
Crosses in hand
Sow for me
Seeds of sultry sex
Reap for me
A daisy at best
