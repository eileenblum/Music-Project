His steps are dogged by blight
Fearful eyes sinking into sockets
Limbs disjointed, hollow bone
Sludge does drip from their fingertips

Boulevards buckle
The beacon of indifference
Seizes in disgust and attraction

Horizons loom
Ominous and vast
They destroy the wombs
Of gestating iconoclasts

Horizons loom
Ominous and vast
Celebrate the tombs...

Grief urchin

His gaze is hounded by doom
And all therein will feel the swoon
No decay without dismay
No vocal chords to helplessly bray
Air and rot meld into one
Death throes under smirking Son
