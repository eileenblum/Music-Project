You are immortalized
In song and rhyme and melody
You redeem a man's aura
Escaping the vice of infidelity

A deafening shriek from 
Female lips
Juxtaposed the male's grunt

Was the holy mother raped?
Was she even a whore?
You may shudder, but men of grace
Still deem themselves masters of lore

Masters
Masters of lore

A smile grew out of the hunt
Another child
Raised with fists

She is female Herod
Malignant as fuck
Gracious as a guillotine
Blinding as diamond's gleam

Slay a bastard child?

A deafening shriek from 
Female lips
Juxtaposed the male's grunt

A smile grew out of the hunt
Another child
Raised with fists
