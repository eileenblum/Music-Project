[Live at the Roseland Theater 2009]Thud of dissociation
Unborn dismay finally given form
This distasteful mortar,
It's the mortar of alienation

Breath is stressed
Thoughts are burdened
Adoration sickens ahead
Ill from its own pulpit

Regurgitate, spraying masses
Parishioners dismissed
Temples dissent and regress to stones
Rife with feigned human compliment

There, thirst for fear
Walk with chains in dreams
Dreams of the sorcerer
Breath drawn only from
Peril's enticing forms
Scorn is contraceptive
Progeny stillborn, malice still warm
Before the skin is torn

Yea, I contaminate
Yea, I peel from the facade
Tattered, pious, symbiotic pages
Conducive to
The trance of the multitude

Lock link through link
Charm chain by chain
Dissolve its cries to abstain
