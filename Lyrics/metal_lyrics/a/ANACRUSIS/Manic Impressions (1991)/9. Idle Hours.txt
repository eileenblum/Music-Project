[Lyrics by J. Emery and K. Nardi]

Repeat this habitual course 
To lift this weight which drags me under
Treading in my remorse
I must stay above the surface longer

Shattering...

Shattering needed rest
Awakened reality
I must confront without...
These idle hours of sleep

Welcome this simple change
Find solace in my frequent slumber
Leaving the once mundane
Escape this world of wretched plunder

Shattering...

Shattering needed rest
Awakened reality
I must confront without...
These idle hours of sleep

Shattering needed rest
Awakened reality
I must confront without...
These idle hours of...
...Sleep
