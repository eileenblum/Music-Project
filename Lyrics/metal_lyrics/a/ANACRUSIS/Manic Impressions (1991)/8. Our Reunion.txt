[Lyrics by K. Nardi]

To see the world so differently
Had never seemed a crime
But still I felt the punishment of disapproving eyes
The criticism misconstrued
Had driven me away
In bitterness which helped create the world I grew to hate

'Round and 'Round and 'Round and 'Round we go
Divided by the things we can't show
Now, you're standing beside yourself
In anger, you hide yourself
Afraid for me
Inside, is something no words can reach
And only that time could teach
Now I anxiously await Our Reunion

A feeling that I couldn't place
A reflection I couldn't face
By making you my enemy, it was easy to run from me
Naivete's distorted view
All the things I thought I knew
Now I finally understand what separates the "men" from the man

'Round and 'Round and 'Round and 'Round we go
Divided by the things we can't show
Now, you're standing beside yourself
In anger you hide yourself
Afraid for me
Inside, is something no words could reach
And only time could teach
Now I anxiously await Our Reunion

'Round and 'Round and 'Round and 'Round we go
Divided by the things we can't show
Now, you're standing beside yourself
In anger you hide yourself
Afraid for me
Inside, is something no words could reach
And only that time could teach
Now I anxiously await Our Reunion
