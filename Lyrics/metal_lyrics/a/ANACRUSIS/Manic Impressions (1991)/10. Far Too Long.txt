[Lyrics by K. Nardi]

We have pretended far too long
Ignoring far too much
Accountability long overdue
We have neglected far too long
Assuming far too much
Hoping out ignorance will see us through

We have hated far too long
Hurting far too much
Feelings of compassion stripped away
We have followed far too long
Denying far too much
Responsibility has gone astray

I hope in my heart of hearts
With all my soul and mind
That it's not irreversible
That this isn't all there is

We have accused for far too long
Blaming far too much
Never really able to accept
We have doubted far too long
Distrusting far too much
Our contempt leaves no room for empathy

I hope in my heart of hearts
With all my soul and mind
That it's not irreversible
That this isn't all there is
