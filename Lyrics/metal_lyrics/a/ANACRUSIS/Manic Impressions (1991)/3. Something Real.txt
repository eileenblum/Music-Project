[Lyrics by K. Nardi]

All those things that I tried to be,
While wandering further from me
I 'd choked myself in my apathy,
Until I no longer could breathe

My heart, and my hand, always reaching...
Without you within, I was searching...
For something real

The fear followed me and tightly closed my eyes.
The pain crippled me and buried deep the will to even try...

To see so much standing before me
And think there was nothing here for me
How much more wrong could I be?
How much more wrong?

The warmth of life had forgotten me
And left me so cold and alone
But you covered me and placed into me
A feeling like none I had known

My heart, and my hand, I have traded...
With you in my arms I am closer...
To something real

The fear followed me and tightly closed my eyes.
The pain crippled me and buried deep the will to even try...

To see so much standing before me 
And think there was nothing here for me
How much more wrong could I be?
How much more wrong could I be?

My heart, and my hand, I have traded...
With you in my arms I am closer...
To something real

To see so much standing before me
And think there was nothing here for me
How much more wrong could I be?
How much more wrong could I be?
