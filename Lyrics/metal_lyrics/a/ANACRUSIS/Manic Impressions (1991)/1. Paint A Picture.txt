[Lyrics by K. Nardi]

Colors diluted by the lies
And painted thick across the sky
Have seen all life whither and die
I gaze up at this forgery
Up at this dark grim tapestry
And mourn the world once promised me

Beneath this canvas monochrome
Wrapped in the shroud of this grey home
I'll paint a picture

Nothingness surrounding me
As far as any eye can see
This doesn't really have to be
I, deeply from the colors, drink
Feel them warming, filling me
The comfort that I need so desperately

Beneath this canvas monochrome
Wrapped in the shroud of this grey home
I'll paint a picture all my own

So blind beneath this canopy
So still in lifeless scenery
So pale within this shadow over me
The grey no longer satisfies
The colors neutral to these eyes
I long again to see the sky
I search to find a brighter side
With eyes so frail against the light
Which seems at times to burn me from inside
The grey no longer satisfies
The colors neutral to these eyes
I long again to see the sky

Colors diluted by the lies
And painted thick across the sky
Have seen all life whither and die
I gaze upon this forgery
Up at this dark grim tapestry
And mourn the world once promised me

Beneath this canvas monochrome
Wrapped in the shroud of this grey home
I'll paint a picture all my own
