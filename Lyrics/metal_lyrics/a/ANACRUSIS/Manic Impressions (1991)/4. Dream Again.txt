[Lyrics by J. Emery and K. Nardi]

I don't dream anymore
Yes, they just seem to fade
Always stripping me so clean...
Deserting me

I strive to retain my goals
And try to achieve a certain life
So I can at last be free
Once again allowed to dream

I try hard to keep my hold
So as not to drift away
Still, I cling to hope in vain...
To dull the pain

I strive to retain my goals
And achieve a certain life
So I can at last be free
Once again allowed to dream

Someday I'll understand
These aspirations at hand

I strive to retain my goals
And try to achieve a certain life
So I can at last be free
Once again allowed to dream

Someday I'll understand
These aspirations at hand
Someday I finally will see
My ambition's mortality...
Someday...
