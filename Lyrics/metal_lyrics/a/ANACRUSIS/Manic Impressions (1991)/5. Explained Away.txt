[Lyrics by J. Emery]

Donning a sweet contented mask
Acquiring bliss, a grueling task
Adoring a regretful past
Wondering how long it can last

Frequenting a cold empty void
And fearing I am, paranoid
Obeying this despondent way
The crumbling hopes, the price to pay

Contorted veil of false fulfillment
So easily explained away... explained away

Nothing changes the future past
Pretending to the very last
Contorted veil of false fulfillment
So easily explained away

Driving onward, must gratify
I'm posing in a satisfied lie
Disregarding this emptiness
And settling, now, for so much less

Contorted veil of false fulfillment
So easily explained away

Donning a sweet contented mask
Acquiring bliss a grueling task
Nothing changes the future past
Pretending to the very last

Contorted veil of false fulfillment
So easily explained away... explained away...
Explained away...
