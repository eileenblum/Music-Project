[Lyrics by K. Heidbreder]

Lying there on satin sheets
Her body cold her heart still beats
A frozen love is your defeat
Sitting on her icy throne
What she sees she makes her own
Her passion dead as still as stone
Your balls are in her frozen grip
you know you're on a sinking ship
Its passage is a one way trip

Trying hard you can't get through
You've done all that you can do
Hoping that she wants it too
Crawling to her on your knees
All you want to do is please
Fuck up once your mind she'll freeze
Back to her you'll come again
She'll decide just where and when
This pain and torture will it end

You scream and cry
Your dying plea
You try so hard
You can't break free
It's love you want
It makes you itch
You know she is
A frigid fucking bitch

She'll make you cry she'll make you bleed
Infect you with her demon seed
On your soul she does feed
Temptress harlot fucking whore
Knocks you down you're back for more
Leaves you lying on the floor
Leave her side you'd sooner die
You've tempted fate you scream and cry
Shattered dreams all empty lies

You're in her hold you'll do her will
By crushing you she gets her thrill
With twisted words she does kill
In the dark she's always there
Through your flesh she does tear
Smash your hopes she doesn't care
Pain she'll bring to your soul
She's got you now she has control
Your demise her wretched goal

[repeat 1st verse]
