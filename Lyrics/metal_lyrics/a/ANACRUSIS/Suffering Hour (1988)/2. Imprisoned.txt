[lyrics by K. Nardi]

A hell is upon us now this day
Silence whispering unspoken rage
To lend a hand but not in force
To speak our minds in free discourse

Keep closed our eyes
Blind us from the fools unseen
Keep closed our hearts
Drain emotion to plant the seed
Keep closed our minds
Turn innocence to ignorance
Keep closed the mouths
Mute the verbal dissonance...Always

Use not, o'youth, the spoken word
Here to be seen and not to be heard
Thinking red-handed we are caught
Arrest the growth of human thought

Keep closed our eyes
Blind us from the fools unseen
Keep closed our hearts
Drain emotion to plant the seed
Keep closed our minds
Turn innocence to ignorance
Keep closed the mouths
Mute the verbal dissonance...Always

A hell is upon us now this day
Silence whispering unspoken rage
How can we grow with bars about?
Imprisoned in a cell of doubt

Keep closed our eyes
Blind us from the fools unseen
Keep closed our hearts
Drain emotion to plant the seed
Keep closed our minds
Turn innocence to ignorance
Keep closed the mouths
Mute the verbal dissonance...Always

How can we grow with bars about?
Imprisoned in a cell of doubt

Keep closed our eyes
Blind us from the fools unseen
Keep closed our hearts
Drain emotion to plant the seed
Keep closed our minds
Turn innocence to ignorance
Keep closed the mouths
Mute the verbal dissonance...Always

...Always
...Always
