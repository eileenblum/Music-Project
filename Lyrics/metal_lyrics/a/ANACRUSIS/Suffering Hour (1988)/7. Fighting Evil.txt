[Lyrics by K. Nardi]

I know it's true that you're feeling oppressed
I know that some hold you down
But fighting evil with still more evil
Is not the way it's done

We run in circles inside our minds
With no way out or in
If we're not careful they'll get our souls
We musn't let them win

We're fighting evil...

The hands of darkness, they reach out for you
It's not a game we play
Madmen telling, but you don't listen
To a single word they say

We run in circles inside our minds
With no way out or in
If we're not careful they'll get our souls
We musn't let them win

We're fighting evil...

They're blinding your eyes, telling you lies
To bring disorder to the world
But don't you give in
We've got to show them together we can be strong

We run in circles inside our minds
With no way out or in
If we're not careful they'll get our souls
We musn't let them win

We're fighting evil...
