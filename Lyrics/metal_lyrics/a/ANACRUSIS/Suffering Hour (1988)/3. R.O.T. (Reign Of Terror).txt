[Lyrics by K. Nardi]

Pools of blood of deepest red
Waves that soak the world in dead
Watch the bloodbath as it grows
Drowning all hope as it flows
Fear, gripping
We're, slipping

Watch as the angry masses persecute the weak
As helpless people die...
From death, the air will reek
...Reign of terror

The world's unrest can't be dismissed
A guillotine of hate exists
Ignore and it will have our heads
As anger bathes on our bloodshed
Fear, gripping
We're, slipping

Watch as the innocent
Fall prey to sickened minds
We turn our backs
But we can't leave the fear behind
...Reign of terror

Shadow grows nearer
Blackening fear descends
Darkness speaks clearer
Freedom's light will end

Pools of blood of deepest red
Waves that soak the world in dead
Watch the bloodbath as it grows
Drowning all hope as it flows

Watch as the angry masses persecute the weak
As helpless people die...
From death, the air will reek
...Reign of terror
