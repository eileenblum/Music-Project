State of condition comatose burn victim
The deaf blind paralyzed blight
Pure decision to end the suffering of those
That cannot win the fight

So what'd you do, so what'd you do
With your god the fat you chewed
And from his silence to your faith infer
To split the hair and watch them suffer
And still, you say "you're playing god" "in the name of god"
"for the love of god" ...goddamn you

Opposition to prolonged life decision
By the man who calls himself right
Holier than thee, you go breaking your creed
Solely perceived on your false insight

[chorus]

As her eyesight fades
In the dark she'll curse your name
His hearing dissipates
Now in silence he'll curse your name
The man under a bullets reign
They will all curse your name
The child defaced by flame
They will all curse your name

[Ryan solo]
Time passes and the nation of god refuses time is wasted on a contradicting point
They taste their flexible morality and choke on the bitter reality

[Greg solo]
[Ryan solo]
[Greg &amp; Ryan]

State of affliction derails your conviction
By the man at first who wasn't sold
Your position faces the opposition
Now a victim of your misguided mold

[chorus]

[Greg solo]
