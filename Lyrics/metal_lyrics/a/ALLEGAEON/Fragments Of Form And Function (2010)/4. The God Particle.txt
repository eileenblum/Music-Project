Accelerate the matter
Showers of debris
Defines a universe so empty
Dark matter
Super symmetry
Accounts for that which is unseen

Can electromagnetic collisions determine our creation?

At what expense
We prove our existence
Exhaust axons of belief
Machinery so immense
A universe with no dimensions

Enter the void
Black nothing
Tug the strings of mortality
Energetic
Devices prey
On the fabric of reality

[pre-chorus]

[Greg solo]

Mankind pushes forward
Feeding on answers
Mankind pushes forward
For the truth
And understanding
Comprehending proof
Through light speed energized particles
