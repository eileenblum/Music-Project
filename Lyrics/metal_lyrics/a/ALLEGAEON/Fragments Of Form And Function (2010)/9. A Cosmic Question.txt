Conjectures thrive,
Why are we alive?
Presenting an open mind
Intergalactic travel?
Dimensions?
A product of genetics?

What defines reality?
What defines a soul?
Where is the line of fathom
And how much truth do we know?

What lies beyond what we see?
These cosmic questions for all humanity
What lies beyond what we know and see?
These endless questions are for all entities

Too many signs in this life to ignore
What were the ancients telling us?
From Giza to galaxies
Exceeding comprehension
What's the truth on foreign life?

What defines reality?
What defines a soul?
Where is the line of fathom
And how much truth do we know?

What lies beyond what we see?
These cosmic questions for all humanity
What lies beyond what we know and see?
These endless questions are for all entities

Are the answers here
On this sphere we occupy?
In the land we're bleeding dry?
Is the truth disguised?
Should we look to the skies?
Would we find ties to global demise?

So many have vanished
At what cause and time?
Did civilizations face annihilation?
Infinite, no walls,
Just a blink of an eye,
When is the beginning and end
Of existence and time?

What defines reality?
What defines a soul?
Where is the line of fathom
And how much truth do we know?

What lies beyond what we see?
These cosmic questions for all humanity
What lies beyond what we know and see?
These endless questions are for all entities
