Inside a rational haze through an irrational gaze
The future in reverse a path to primitive days

Singularity returns as normality turns
Zero volume infinite density the hourglass of humanity burns

Mechanisms machines to mold our fate as we travel across the folded line

Backwards in time
Through a tear in the sky
Through the mirror universe
Staring back at familiar eyes

Symmetric in time
Across the folded line
Outside the horizon
Reform to original design

To re-write the past is to reform the future
Erase all account
Dissipating doubt

Parallel point of origin
Lines of time diverge
Endless chance to change the past
To make the lines converge

[Ryan solo]

A spatial shortcut through electric lines of force
An exchange of space and time

[Ryan solo]

A linear shortcut through electric lines of force
An exchange of matter and time

[Greg solo]
