Animalistic behaviors triumph for we are here to procreate spreading seed
Sub conscious focus to dominate survival of the fittest.

The filth of the land is blinded by advancement and reality proceeds to drift away

We will fight we will destroy together we will consume the weak
Target in sight we will destroy together we will consume the weak

[Greg solo]

Fixed action patterns aggression seems to deem fit sex feeding fight or flight is integrated

A species built to prevail the taste of blood entices you not knowing how to fail

[Ryan solo]

Do you live in fear or create it?
[Ryan &amp; Greg]

We are mastering the art of intimidation feeding the fire of confrontation
