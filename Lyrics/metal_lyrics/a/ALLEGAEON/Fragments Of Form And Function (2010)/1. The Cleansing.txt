This day unfolds wrath beyond life
In front of your eyes we face the cycle
The ground trembles as elevations rise
The land gives way now we face the blast

Your final hour brings understanding that your gods right under you

This is the cleansing a global campaign exterminating the virus that is us
Cleansing a global sentence reigning with natural justice

This day unfolds for we cannot proceed
The time is now for the land to bleed
The global cleansing humankind fears
Ash ridden skies Armageddon nears

[pre-chorus]
[chorus]

The skies light up with fire designed to cleanse the land
Pyroclastic flow devours all within its path

[Greg solo]

Destroying mans empires the infection that is us
A conclusion to humanity our existence turns to dust

[Ryan solo]
[Greg solo]

This day of truth of humankind's demise exploits the powers of religions lies
Catastrophic eruptions rhyolite floods wash away the streets

[pre-chorus]
[chorus]
