Cycles in motion continuously shifting conditions and shifting the seas
With life hosting life endlessly a complex design

The skies clear up for the cleansing has passed
The layers show signs of a violent past
That is proving defining the cycle the system
Theories based on single cell organisms

With energy water and oxygen
Is it possible to revive life again?
What was once spoiled is now fertile land
The question stands was this renewal planned?

[Ryan solo]

Complex reactions for this beast to thrive
Conditions of life adapting to design
Photosynthesis drive atmosphere stabilizes
Self-sustaining biological processes

[chorus]

[Greg solo]

Cycles in motion continuously shifting conditions and shifting the seas
With life hosting life endlessly a complex design renewing

[Greg solo]

Translating the land calculating the stages
Beating the clock surviving the ages
Staring so deep in the eyes of defeat

Knowing now that this phase will repeat

[chorus]
