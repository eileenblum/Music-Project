A war within the severs ties from all dissociation
Breathing in the chaos tenfold manipulation

The severity lost identity self- mutilation
Unstable unable to clear your head
The visions consume you of your loved ones dead

They say beauty's on your inside but your inside is disfigured
Born without a choice on how you're wired
They say beauty's on your inside but your inside is disfigured
Feeling the wrath of life you manufactured

Empty again regulation deficiency idealization
Past the point of self-control your actions read devaluation
