A prescription for their pocketbooks a lethal dose of agony
Cutting the throats of the wretched
Deranged and desensitized no remorse is seen in their eyes
Walking the path of the dead

Who are you to design the life we live?
Who are you to decline a further chapter?

Mass belief in a trusting system built by greed on gold foundations
Tasting the chance of an uncertain future
And now there profits to be made so now there's lives to be saved
This new found disease deserves a pill

[chorus]

[Rayn solo]

Those who control the knowledge controls the masses

[Greg solo]

Those who control the knowledge controls the flock

[Ryan solo]
[Greg solo]

[chorus]
