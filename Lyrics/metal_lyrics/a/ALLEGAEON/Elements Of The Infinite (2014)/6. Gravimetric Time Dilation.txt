Time dilation varies measured between events
with masses now in the distance accelerating effects
does past and future exist now? 
beyond our vision we must know how
our perception of time defined by motion defined by lines
fourth dimension design created moments within our minds
a constant illusion maintaining different rates
relative conclusion with redshift proven traits
does past and future exist now? 
beyond our vision we must know how
our perception of time defined by motion defined by lines
fourth dimension design created moments within our minds
relativity gravitational potential
frame of reference different outputs different times
what is the relevance of time? 
being an illusion in our minds
center of gravity the cycle delays
distance determines modified when away
does past and future exist now? 
beyond our vision we must know how
our perception of time defined by motion defined by lines
fourth dimension design created moments within our minds
what is the relevance of time?
