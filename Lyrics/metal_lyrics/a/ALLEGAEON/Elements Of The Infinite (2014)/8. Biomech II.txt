God damn you
Tissue for the harvest extracting cells
clustered genetic samples fuse bind and meld
navigation of creation advanced reparation
to make the sick whole by the printing of organs
engaging life enhancement medical advancement
a new state of praxis mortality bereavement
time still passes and the nation refuses
humanity wasted on a contradicting point
to be a more caring god intelligent by our design
to be a more caring god to prove ourselves divine
replication no rejection as yesterday's science fiction
now today's science fact printing your biomech
Impede the progress profess the regress
based on archaic fiction advancement interdiction
proclamation of holy law harm the meek you claim to serve
force fed by the spoon of flaw your fallacy preserved
to be a more caring god intelligent by our design
to be a more caring god to prove ourselves divine
replication no rejection as yesterday's science fiction
now today's science fact printing your biomech
as the masses prayed her flesh decayed
holy crusades sent to restrain
as the masses prayed his health degrades 
none of them were saved
so what'd you do so what'd you do
with your god the fat you chewed
and from his silence to your faith infer
to split the hair and watch them suffer
god damn you 
state of affliction derails your conviction
by the man at first who wasn't sold
your position faces the opposition
now a victim of your misguided mold
to be a more caring god intelligent by our design
to be a more caring god to prove ourselves divine
replication no rejection as yesterday's science fiction
now today's science fact printing your biomech
