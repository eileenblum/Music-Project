Life (life)
Death (death) 
In due time is the last breath
Carbon ceased operation right there flashed before your eyes

Decline defined the mindâs demise pineal glandâs release
Behind the eyes the mind dies and gives into defeat

Consciousness permanently ceases
Bringing eternal oblivion

Decline defined the mindâs demise pineal glandâs release
Behind the eyes the mind dies and gives into defeat

Overthrown adrenaline owned
Breathing slows down to begin the heart drop
Acceptance sets in from within the clock stops

Fading into detachment as black prevails
No longer repentant brought forth the final exhale
Life (life) 
Death (death) 
As of now there's nothing left
Carbon broke down from flesh left to disperse amongst all of this

Decline defined the mindâs demise pineal glandâs release
Behind the eyes the mind dies and gives into defeat
