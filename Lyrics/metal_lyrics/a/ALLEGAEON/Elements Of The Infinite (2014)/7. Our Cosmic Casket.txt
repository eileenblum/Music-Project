Spinning mass matter collapses
Light contorted and nothing passes
Frame dragging photon sphere
Light distorted and disappears

Swallowed by darkness 
We fade into nothingness

Tidal force solar masses
Endless density cosmic casket
Transcending we near the threshold

Swallowed by darkness 
We fade into nothingness

Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red within rapid rotation

Particles expanding 
Consuming surroundings 

A day of reckoning for all of us

Mass energy linear position 
Electric charge angular momentum
A day of reckoning for all of us 
The day of reckoning is upon us

[Solo: Burgess, Stancel, Burgess]

Spinning mass matter collapsed
Light contorted and nothing passed
Beyond the point of no return
All of man reduced to worm

Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red within rapid rotationï»¿ 

Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red swallowed by darkness

Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red within rapid rotation
