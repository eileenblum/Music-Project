By this you will know that I am the LORD the rivers will turn
hover thy staff over water hordes of frogs are born
smite the dust of the land to become lice and gnats
for stolen worship an army of flies attack
persuasive genocide death dealt for praise
on that same night I will pass through and strike down
I will bring judgment your first born is mine now
pestilence of necessities realm of death be brought
thy skin will crawl with boils left to fester
hail pounds down pharaoh refuses
for stolen worship the wrath of myriad locusts
persuasive genocide death dealt for praise 
on that same night I will pass through and strike down
I will bring judgment your first born is mine now
thou will feel the darkness and not see
for three days
reliant on other senses I do decree
for three days
stretch your hand out to the sky
darkness spreads over
refusing any compromise
the death of sun god grows closer
persuasive genocide death dealt for praise
on that same night I will pass through and strike down
I will bring judgment your first born is mine now
on that same night I will pass through and strike down
I will bring judgment your first born is mine now
