Tech push forced advancement now who to save?
with it left up to the tyrants itâs you or me
weâre fighting bleeding and killing ourselves
positions are rendered to leave this hell
this crust is left in ruins
defiled and left to burn
we must look to the stars (the stars)
for another living term
weâve exhausted our existence here
we shall not remain
with the truth now is in the distance
humanity seeks new domain
this crust is left in ruins
defiled and left to burn
we must look to the stars (the stars)
for another living term
done away with resources 
now I control all the forces
progress has been halted weâve been defaulted
right down to the ashes that we once were
(right down to the ashes)
this crust is left in ruins
defiled and left to burn
we must look to the stars (the stars)
for another living term
now Iâm the tyrant life here is done
now Iâm the cancer sparing none
