Prophase
The nucleolus disappears,
Mitotic spindle forms
Sisters joined by duplicated centromere
Metaphase
Stretching centrioles
Pushing to the center
Grasping for pairs of chromosomes

Anaphase
Digging in their claws
Spindle fibers pull
Genetic materials apart
Telophase
Separation of cells
Cytoplasm splits
Before the process begins again

Prophase
Crossing over meets an end
Homologous pairs exist in absence
Metaphase
Single columns form
Cell separation exiling the once coupled
Anaphase
Reach to the center once again
Separation on a smaller scale
Dividing chromatids
Telophase
Another nucleus forms
Splitting into four
Before new cells are born

Interphase
Cellular growth, fulfilling function
Interphase
Replication of genetic information

This life defined
By change and development
Deep inside

Division and duplication of cells
A constant occurrence in this shell

Necessary for reproduction
Variety created, fulfilling function
Necessary for reproduction
Variety created,
Totality completed
