Disinformation scares us
Impropriety thickens and clouds the air
Arrogance presents itself
Unbidden and creating despair

Dogmatic achievements tearing
Myths and monuments apart at the seams
Under the veil of wonder and terror
Forcing the masses to make believe

No room for speculation
Those left behind beg for salvation

failure to grow
failure to swallow the truth of it all
to force the foyer open
and enter an age of gold
intrepid and measured steps
that prove to go in no direction at all
still water before the tempest
hubris before the fall

Information era
methods developed to cross compare
evidence presents itself
once hidden origins laying bare

Systemic beliefs that bound us
disintegrate after thousands of years
Free from the reins of wonder and terror
What once was concrete now vanishes into the air

No room for speculation
those left behind beg for salvation

patience to grow
patience to swallow the truth of it all
to force the foyer open
and enter an age of gold
intrepid and measured steps
that prove to go in all directions at once
still water absorbs the tempest
progress forgets the fall
To come so far in so little time
Is what once may have been called
Despicable

To come so far in so little time
In which now is called
A miracle

Where do we go?
Now that we've swallowed the truth of it all
and moved forward
We've forced the foyer open
and entered an age of gold
intrepid and measured steps
Have taken us in all directions at once
still water absorbed the tempest
Perseverance will conquer all
