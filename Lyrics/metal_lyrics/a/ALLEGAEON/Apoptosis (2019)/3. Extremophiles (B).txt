I am exposed to elements known
to, in excess, destroy and dethrone
Total envelopment of
the system, resistant suspended as stone

From mountain heights to oceans of ice
searing heat to arctic freeze, replacement of hydration is
essential to life and so I thrive
disordered proteins crystallize, converted cells now vitrified

Superimposed on top of my own
regenesis, a genetic restructuring not ever seen
before. I stand alone;
a monument to obstruent adaptation,
cryptobiotic response

From mountain heights to oceans of ice
searing heat to arctic freeze, replacement of hydration is
essential to life and so I thrive
disordered proteins crystallize, converted cells now vitrified

I survive
Immortality realized
I survive
Moving ever forward
To the precipice of time
Holding the key to eternal life

Dueling shadows of mystery gone
congruent solutions, set the stage
a glimpse of what's to come

Will we decide, be rid of this blight
fear of death, sorrow, disease... escape or face the weakening
our fading timeline to face genocide
A fronte praecipitium a tergo lupi
repair our structure or die

I survive
Immortality realized
I survive
Moving ever forward
To the precipice of time
Holding the keys to eternal life

Encroaching our own hopelessness
We drift away toward...

I stare and burn my eyes out
fate calls do we answer or not
chance to learn from life smaller yet
more resilient than ours

I stare and burn my eyes out
fate calls do we answer or not
chance to learn from life smaller yet
more resilient than ours

Immortality realized
I survive
Moving ever forward
To the precipice of time
Holding the key to eternal life.
I survive
Immortality realized
I survive
Metamorphosis impedes on new horizons
Holding the key to eternal life.
