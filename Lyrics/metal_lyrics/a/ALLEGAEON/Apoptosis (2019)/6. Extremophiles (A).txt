Growing, years of reforming
Reshaping the ways
capable of responding to change

Flowing in between spaces
In which only few dare to venture
And fewer return

Slowly morphing
Into something more

To live they must learn to adapt
Entering stasis, replacing water with glass

Showing traces of traits
Remaining in places
Inhospitable and dangerous

Slowly morphing
Into something more

Swirling whirlpool of genes
Primordial stewing
Developing skills to survive the extreme

Stowing deep and away
Freezing or searing
Or ejected into the vacuum of space

Slowly morphing
Into something more

To live they must learn to adapt
Entering stasis, replacing water with glass

They will adapt

Thrown
Into the open
Shores
From where is born
Hope
For long surviving hosts

Swirling whirlpool of means
To ends out of reach
Developing will to overcome the extreme
