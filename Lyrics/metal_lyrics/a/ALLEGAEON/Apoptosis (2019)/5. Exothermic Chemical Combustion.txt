A spark emerges kindling the flame
Set by components: heat, fuel, and oxygen
Tearing through forests; infernal blaze
Scorching the soil, making room for life to start again

Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Magnesium
Calcium, Potassium, Sulfuric Amino Acids

Through this disaster
Enrich the world
Shedding the skin of the canopy, return to earth
The ashen rain
Falls to the world
Exothermic chemical combustion, let it burn

Natural pyre, arboreal funeral
And in the wake, lay massive graves
Supersurface catacombs of charcoal bones
An empty slate to set the stage for what's to come

Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Magnesium
Calcium, Potassium, Sulfuric Amino Acids

Through this disaster
Enrich the world
Shedding the skin of the canopy, return to earth
The ashen rain
Falls to the world
Exothermic chemical combustion, let it burn

Plant perception, fire-mediated serotinous seed dispersion
Alkalinity and acidity create eutrophic soil

Germination and flowering occur
Replacing with new life what was taken in disaster

Through this disaster
Enrich the world
Shedding the skin of the canopy, return to earth
The ashen rain
Fall to the World
Exothermic chemical combustion, let it burn

Let it burn.
