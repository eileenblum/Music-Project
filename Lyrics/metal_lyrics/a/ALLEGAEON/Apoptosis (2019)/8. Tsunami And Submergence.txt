Beneath the surface faults are stirring
and shifts occur
The body under pressure

The rise and fall
of ocean waters
Subducting or overriding plates
Create the wave

The rise and fall
of civilizations
They are bred in ignorance of placement
Drown in the wave

Tempestuous and turbulent
The currents rip apart the world
The body swells and saunters
It conquers.

The rise and fall
Of ocean waters
Subducting or overriding plates
Create the wave

The rise and fall
Of civilizations
They are bred in ignorance of placement
Drown in the wave

Wiping out everything around its surroundings
Wiping out everyone found under the thundering
Crash in a flash, whipped and lashed by wind and water
Slaughtered by what once nurtured, caught in submergence
Painted by the colors of the currents

Drowned and gone
Lost in the ocean
Drowned and gone
Lost and forgotten
