[Solo: Greg]

Writhing motion, stirs inside of me
A foreign sense beneath the shroud
Once vague, now thickening,
I sip the nectar 
and come to be.
Now as the system starts,
I realize my destiny.

Out of the darkness, I start to see
Cities of the old, decayed,
their structures: all burning.
Vile pollution from crowded streets
Bringing the end
with incredible efficiency.

The arbiter
I see darkness in your soul
The harbinger
of judgement sent with lethal force
There is no comfort to accommodate humanity destroyed
This world encased in biological waste and gone to spoil

Biological waste, destroy it all.

[Solo: Michael and Greg]

Designed to infiltrate
capture and subjugate
this living scourge on nature
nourishing death and failure

Since an unconscious state
I've learned and grown to hate
this living scourge on nature 
nourishing death and failure

[Solo: Michael] 

The arbiter
I see the darkness in your soul
The harbinger 
of judgement bringing evil forth
There is no comfort to accommodate humanity destroyed
This world encased in biological waste and gone to spoil 

Biological waste, destroy it all.

And now before me, I cannot see
Lies and nightmares in the dark reflecting everything
Vile pollution from crowded streets
bringing the end with incredible efficiency
