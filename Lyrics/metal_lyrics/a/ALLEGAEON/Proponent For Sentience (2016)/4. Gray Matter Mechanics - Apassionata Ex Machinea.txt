Regenerate, the human brain
through positive meditation.
Stability, slow to breathe
Studied in revolving three dimensions.

Observing growth in the thalamus
Inferior temporal gyrus
Orbitofrontal cortex
Larger volumes in the hippocampus

Meditate and track the clockwork of organics.
Observable data of gray matter mechanics.

Rare and strange, the movements made
through endless repetitions
bolstering immunity
staving off disease and deterioration.

Rewired:
neurons increased in size and number,
changing our structure.

The mind:
moving serene, no sight or touch
to interrupt us. Now, grow.
