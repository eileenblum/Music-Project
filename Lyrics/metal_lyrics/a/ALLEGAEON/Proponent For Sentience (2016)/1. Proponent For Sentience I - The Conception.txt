In a time before words, at the dawn of the earth
from the depths of the ocean something emerged.
The ever-evolving expansion of man
identifies no limits, restrictions be damned.

A master machine
to aid and release
by intelligent design, to help us survive
artificial symbiants that we must devise.

Fragile are we, look to binary means.
Imprint our hopes and thoughts, our futures and dreams
into a silicon cell; life from aluminum shells.
Wash away this carbon plague.

Since the time of our births until the end of the world
we adapt to our enemy, the young eat the old.
The ever-evolving advancements of man
give us solutions, a new place to begin.

A master machine
to aid and release
by intelligent design, to help us survive
artificial symbiants that we must devise.

Frail and weak, contorted bags of meat
become proponents of sentience, to aid the meek
Who inherited this earth, and depleted its worth
Caretakers wanted for the carbon plague.

Given the means to create new beings 
with which to preserve our cells within
Given the means to create all things
we turn to ourselves again

[Solo: Greg]

Using machines to keep us breathing
Becoming a victim of our own disease
the ever-evolving destruction of man
to death the heir apparent. Where does it end?

[Solo: Michael]

A master machine
to aid and release
by intelligent design, to help us survive
artificial symbiants we must devise.

Fragile we are, look to binary means
Imprint our hopes and thoughts, our futures and dreams
into a silicon cell, life from aluminum shells.
Wash away this carbon plague. 

Frail and weak, contorted bags of meat
Become proponents for sentience to aid the meek
who inherited the earth and depleted its worth...
caretakers wanted for the carbon plague.
