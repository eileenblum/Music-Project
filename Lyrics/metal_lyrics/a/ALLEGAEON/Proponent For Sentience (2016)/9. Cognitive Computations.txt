A vision, free of form,
curling through neural canyons;
gaining traction in this labyrinth of synapses.
Partitions ripped and torn,
scorched by vicious thought expansion;
rapidly flashing as walls begin collapsing
Decisions ever born-
swirling sets of circumstances;
frantically grasping out for logic in this madness.

Expeditions to foreign zones-
the composition of gods and worms
within the mind while feigning self-determination

Reborn, reformed reality torn-
release identification through beliefs.
Restore, transform the anatomy of
the mind as is: a cognitive machine

Amidst centrifugal
drifting chemical reactions
pressing the boundaries of human understanding
Through calculation
and retracing the course of action
one can defer that all behavior is a predetermined course
Coursing through our veins are complex sets and strings of ego
Binary beings on a desperate quest for meaning in this world
passing through our space in time as live examples for
computational cognition
the essence of the soul

Reborn reformed reality torn-
release identification through beliefs
Restore, transform the anatomy
of the mind as is: a cognitive machine

Lost in thought
I've gone and returned.

This place of stones 
has overgrown
Long since removed
and left alone
The dream recurring 
wherein is stirring 
a weak and worried
whisper dying and diseased.

[Solo: Michael]

choice is lost
obey this voice without words 
Absent of control 
and spiraling out
spiraling further down.

[Solo: Greg]

Coursing through our veins are complex sets and strings of ego
Binary beings on a desperate quest for meaning in this world
Passing through our space in time as live examples for
computational cognition the essence of the soul

Reborn, reformed reality torn-
release identification through beliefs.
Restore, transform the anatomy of
the mind as is: a cognitive machine
