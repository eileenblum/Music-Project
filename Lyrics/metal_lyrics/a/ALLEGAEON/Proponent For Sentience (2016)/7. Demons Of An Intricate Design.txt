More, just give us more
inhuman and deplorable horrors
for the mob to sink their teeth into.
Source, Straight from the source
capturing the worst of it
the torments of the world

Demons of an intricate design
adhering to sensible means to the ends;
see them at the passage into where
reason ends and lies begin.

Well-wishers mincing words
for "truth" and absolute purpose. Truly worthless
worker drones for propagation
of a fear constructed world.
Inventive tools of war
in deadly surplus the hordes have surfaced
monsters mongering distraction
to the fear infested

The weak are prey for these 
vultures who investigate
the dead, diseased, and dying
to manifest tragedy. 
Breed, theirs is a breed
of an ethically devoid
pursuit of detail.

Demons of an intricate design
adhering to sensible means to the ends;
see them at the passage into where
reason ends and lies begin.

[Solo: Michael]

Twisted, intense
and horrible agendas
Perforate the edges
and disintegrate the core
of the credible. Ineffably contemptible;
posing as professionals
these media whores.
Never relent to the moronic pretenders
Fabricate the answer.
from degenerative sores
baring teeth, reprehensible
and salivating over opportunities 
to desecrate the corpse.
