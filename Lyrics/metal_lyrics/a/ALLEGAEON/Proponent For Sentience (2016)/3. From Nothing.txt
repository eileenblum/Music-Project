Beyond the vastness, the emptiness of space
where nothing is living,
no lifeforms existing,
Within the vacuum, the astronomical waste,
photons are shifting
in motion beginning.

Ignite, collide
While moving at the speed of light.

From nothing 
they survive;
borrowed energy
comes to life.

From nothing
Came the light;
virtual energy
brought to life.

Through these uncertainties in energy and time
emptiness filling
fleeting but living.
Superconducting quantum interference device
stirring and spinning
the mirror emitting.

[Solo: Michael]

Ignite, collide
While moving at the speed of light.

From nothing 
they survive;
borrowed energy
comes to life.

From nothing 
came the light;
virtual energy
brought to life.

[Solo: Michael and Greg]

In pairs they come to focus
for a moment, creeping into our time.
Mass to massive, they transform into matter
in the space they occupy.

[Solo: Greg]

Ignite, collide
while moving at the speed of light

From nothing
they survive;
borrowed energy 
comes to life

From nothing 
came the light;
virtual energy
brought to life.
