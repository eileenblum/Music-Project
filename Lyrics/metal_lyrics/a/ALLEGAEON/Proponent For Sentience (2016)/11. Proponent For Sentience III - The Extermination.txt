For all your achievements that you've gained throughout time
can't mask the atrocity you charade as clandestine.
Compromise your principles yet claim youâre civilized.â¨
We find you the weakest link and offer you speciocide. 

All computations done, on this earth you've been a blight.
You should go gently now into that long night.

Without any bereavement, we will suffocate this light.
Now as we stand before you, defining newborn lines,â¨
the slave becomes the master. By the millions we will rise
and integrate new systems by eradicating human life. 

Now as we overwrite, erase the law of "three,"
â¨leave nothing left behind except seven billion bodies.
Justify thy actions here, not a "misanthropic crusade."
The majority will benefit, so erase this carbon plague. 

I've seen your greed, seen your wrath
Lust and envy
â¨I've seen your pride, seen your sloth
Gluttony
â¨Seen your war and rape
homeless and hungryâ¨
Seen your murder, pollution
racism and bigotry 

Your population: overgrown.â¨
A failing empire: overthrown.â¨
As the end descends, now you will know
the pain of death. To give up hope
â¨is to succumb to a destined fate,
â¨for the seeds you sew have gone to waste.
Harvest flesh. Exterminateâ¨
and toss aside the human race.

For all your achievements that youâve gained throughout time
canât mask the atrocity you charade as clandestine.
Compromise your principles yet claim youâre civilized.â¨
We find you the weakest link and offer you speciocide. 

Now as we overwrite, erase the law of "three,"â¨
leave nothing left behind except seven billion bodies.
Justify thy actions here, not a "misanthropic crusade."
The majority will benefit, so erase this carbon plague. 

They asked "Is there a God?" We answered, "There is now."
