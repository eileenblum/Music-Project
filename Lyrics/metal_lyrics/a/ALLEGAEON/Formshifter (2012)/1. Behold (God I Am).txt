Man's greatest mystery
It's human nature to believe in something
Legions died throughout history
In debate of the one true deity

Ages refuting cloned scriptures
Races of reigning terror

Behold the anger inside
Eyes of the innocent sent their demise
Foretold leaders we create
We the puppets you manipulate

[Solo: Glisan]

Man's greatest tragedy
Opposing sects feud on similar theories
Theologies crucify in the name
Disputing the absolute being

Ages refuting cloned scriptures
Races of reigning terror

Behold the anger inside
Eyes of the innocent sent their demise
Foretold leaders we create
We the puppets you manipulate

[Solo: Burgess]

In defiance over existence
Fueling aversion, feeding envy

Infinite sermons, an endless tirade
One creator of endless carnage

[Solo: Burgess]
[Solo: Glisan]

What logic explains contradiction
Denies equality, promotes eradication

Behold the anger inside
Eyes of the innocent sent their demise
Foretold leaders we create
We the puppets you manipulate

So created, so destroyed
Behold, God I am [2x]
