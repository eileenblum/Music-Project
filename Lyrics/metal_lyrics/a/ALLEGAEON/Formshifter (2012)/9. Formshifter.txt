Triggering of patterns
Through Frequencies of time
Altering identity
Reforming of the skyline
Shifting of the layers
Reformed and refined
Now man and land
Are morphing their designs

The faces of man shift with dividing land

Watch as we span the time
Changing shapes
Changing lines
See as we redefine
Shifting eras
Shifting sides

[Solo: Glisan]

Under the surface
Disturbances dwell
Releasing of energy
That strain and stress have built
Riding on the surface
The aftermath revealed
This violent struggle
Destinations less concealed

The faces of man shift with dividing land

Watch as we span the time
Changing shapes
Changing lines
See as we redefine
Shifting eras
Shifting sides

[Solo: Burgess]

The architects of anarchy
Virility spawning chaos abound
The creators of hostility
Vicinity a breeding ground

[Solo: Glisan]
[Solo: Glisan]

The faces of man shift with dividing land

Watch as we span the time
Changing shapes
Changing lines
See as we redefine
Shifting eras
Shifting sides
