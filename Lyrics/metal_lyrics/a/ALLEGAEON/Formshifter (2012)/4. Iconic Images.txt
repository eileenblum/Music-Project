[Solo: Glisan]

On scripts of Perfection and Plenty
Rest Markings of the Gods
In crypts of deception and memory
Foretell past present and future to all

An era of Oscillation

We've looked to the skies
We've carved into stone
We've held up on high
The tracts and characters of the old

[Solo: Burgess]

Antiquities to Machines
Steel structures stand mighty and tall
The origins now obsolete
Which Primitives had once Foreseen

An era of oscillation

We've looked to the skies
We've carved into stone
We've held up on high
The tracts and characters of the old

[Solo: Glisan]

The heavens look down
On heathens abound
Over star covered skies
Mysteries surround

Designed from above
Creates gods below
Advancing a species forward
Ancient worlds Bestowed

[Solo: Burgess]

Present to future
From man to machines
Origins history
The ancient once had foreseen

An era of Oscillation

We've looked to the skies
We've carved into stone
We've up on high
The tracts and characters of the old
