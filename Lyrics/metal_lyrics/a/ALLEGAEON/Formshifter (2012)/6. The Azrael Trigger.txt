Taking away one's identity
Till their conscious cease to exist
Redirecting their Mentality
Ruling the Mind with an Iron Fist
Subverting sense of control
Coercive Persuasion
Stripping away one's soul
Soon to be Disembodied

Blinded eyes programmed minds controlled
They Lead You follow
Frequencies Redesigned to Obey
And Inside Left hollow

A message to the Subconscious
Subtle Manipulation
Freedom of Mind Lead Astray
With Cerebral Dictation

Subverting Sense of Control
Coercive Persuasion
Stripping away one's soul
Soon to be Disembodied

Blinded eyes Programmed minds controlled
They lead You follow
Frequencies redesigned to obey
And inside Left hollow

Complete Isolation Thought reform
You will do our buddings against your will
Detached from reality mind reborn
You will do our biddings against your will

Repetition and trust in source
Induced distraction opens doors
Subliminal views they enforce
Cognitive dissonance runs its course

Subverting sense of control
Coercive persuasion
Stripping away one's soul
Soon to be disembodied

Blinded eyes programmed minds controlled
They lead You follow
Frequencies redesigned to obey
And inside Left hollow
