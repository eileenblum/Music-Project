Through humanity's progression
Countless generations
Not one word is to remain the same
The populace still stakes their claim

Somebody has their timeline wrong
Can't you see the fallacies?
Somebody has their timeline

Centuries of all beliefs disputed
And yet it remains undefined

The masses carry an axe to grind

Lost hope for prosperity
Crucifying others based on belief
A choice of divinity
Or the opposed theory of nothing

Somebody has their timeline wrong

Somebody has their

Centuries of all beliefs disputed
And yet it remains undefined
Aging systems true meanings become diluted
The masses carry an axe to grind

These convictions
Are to remain undead

[Solo: Glisan]

Somebody has their timeline wrong
Can't you see the fallacies?
Somebody has their timeline wrong

Centuries of all beliefs disputed
And yet it remains undefined
Aging systems true meanings become diluted
The masses carry an axe to grind
