Under his spell to her he was god
Quenching the thirst for lust and blood
Sadistic encounters numbers rise
The bodies recovered multiply

Evil sides
In these two minds

Two wolves in sheep skin the undeserved
Still leaves the question
Why he serves life and she only served

Plaguing the lives of their victims
At the expense of their last breath

Evil resides
In man and bride

Two wolves in sheep skin the undeserved
Still leaves the question
Why he serves life and she only served

They were led to their own slaughter

Abominations under sedation
Nothing can take back what you've done
Emotionless absent malcontent
Nothing will bring back your own blood

[Solo: Glisan]
[Solo: Burgess]

They were led to their own slaughter

Two wolves in sheep skin the undeserved
Still leaves the question
Why he serves life and she only served twelve.
