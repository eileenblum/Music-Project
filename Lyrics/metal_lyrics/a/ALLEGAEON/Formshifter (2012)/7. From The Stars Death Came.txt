Reality presents itself
Forcing us to revisit the past
Once again we face extinction
The end of days is drawing near
Reaching near and far for solutions

Apocalyptic
Solar system ballistics
Projected to hit the sea
Embracing the truth
Of failing this world
With lack of knowledge to curve this tragedy

Tonight's the night of impact
From the skies fire rains
Piercing through the surface
From the stars death came

Engulfed in flames
Atmospheric changes
Floods that wash the land away
Fractured tectonic plates
Debris initiates
The start of a new ice age

Tonight's the night of impact
From the skies fire rains
Piercing through the surface
From the stars death came

[Solo: Burgess]

Colossal cosmic collisions causes
A shaping of a new world

As the nights grow colder by this arctic shift
Vibrations moving slower transitions settle in
Eternal frost is triggered by absent light
Evidence of existence concealed in ice

Tonight's the night of impact
From the skies fire rains
Piercing through the surface
From the stars death came

[Solo: Burgess]
