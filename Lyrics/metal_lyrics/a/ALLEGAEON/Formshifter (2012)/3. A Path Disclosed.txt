Yields Subliminal Effects
Leading the Herd in the Direction
Down the path of great decline

We can all
Take it back
Inform our own
Tear them down
We can all
Take their Throne

Here lies the population that
Believes what they've been sold
Lies forged by Corporations that
Design what we are told

We can all
Take it back
Inform our own
Tear them down
We can all
Take their Throne

Pulling the strings of humanity for a gain
Global Dissection Disclosure Infection
Molding the messages provided
So the Affluent Reigns
Elite made Decisions Governing
Transformations

Past repeats with Revolutions by the ones
That cast the first stone
Fear Deceit Manipulation The Upper Hand
Adjudicates the Known

We can all
Take it back
Inform our own
Tear them down
We can all
Take their Throne
