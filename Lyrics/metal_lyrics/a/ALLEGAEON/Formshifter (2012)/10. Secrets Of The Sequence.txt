As this new millennium dawns our knowledge grows
Hormonal pathways mapped genes juxtaposed
Redefining longevity
Meeting pious acetosity

Genetic modification our chromosomes cease to fray
DNA's Achilles heel oxidization torn away

So what do we do?
So where do we go now that the secret's uncovered?
So what do we do?
So where do we go now that the sequence is deciphered?

Reconstruction for our supremacy
To halt this constant path of mortality
Redefining our design
Continue to multiply and divide

Genetic modification our chromosomes cease to fray
DNA's Achilles heel oxidation torn away

So what do we do?
So where do we go now that the secret's uncovered?
So what do we do?
So where do we go now that the sequence is deciphered?

Life expectancy now infinity
Fountain of youth is now a reality
Population the new emergency
Human perseverance to eternity

An intricate mitochondrial matrix
Collides head on with humanity's ethics
Redefining definitions
Life and death extinction

Genetic modification our chromosomes cease to fray
DNA's Achilles heel oxidation torn away

So what do we do?
So where do we go now that the secret's uncovered?
So what do we do?
So where do we go now that the sequence is deciphered?
