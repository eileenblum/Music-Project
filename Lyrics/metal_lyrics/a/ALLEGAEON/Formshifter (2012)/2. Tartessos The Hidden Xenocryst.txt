In this bay on Sandbar Mantels
A city built in concentric circles
Advancements Spawned
And by others sought
Our Metallurgy is Second to Naught
Praised by Pharaoh and Plebs alike
On throne and stone a beacon of light
To separate from the myths
Just delve into the hieroglyphs
To set forth the crowning of Atlantis

The birthplace of Civilization
Cast to the depths the kingdom fell
they faced annihilation
Our legacy is a xenocryst

From Herculean to Poseidon
From Atlantic to the Aegean
From the Greek to Egyptian
From the End of (The) World descend
Swallowed at Gibraltar's straits
Tsunami waters open floodgates
To separate from the myths
Just delve into the Hieroglyphs
To set forth the crowning of Atlantis

The birthplace of Civilization
Cast to the depths the kingdom fell
They faced annihilation
Our legacy is a Xenocryst

[Solo: Glisan]
[Solo: Burgess]

Under the surface
Awaits Antiquity
With the Capacity
Of an Epiphany

[Solo: Glisan]

Beneath the Surface
Arcane secrets lie
Rewrite our histories
The key to ancient times

[Solo: Burgess]

Ancient Intelligence brought forth Development
Washed Away by Torrential Waves
Submerged Continent they Fled for New Settlement
Those left behind were sent to their graves

The Birthplace of Civilization
Cast to the depths the kingdom fell
They faced Annihilation
Our legacy is a xenocryst
