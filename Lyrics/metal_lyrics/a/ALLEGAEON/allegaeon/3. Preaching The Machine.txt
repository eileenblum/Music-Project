A belief, a conjured up belief, sworn to make you pay
The greatest lie, ever created, for a monetary donation

Watch for, a fallout
Then see, what you believe in now

Vast amounts of mind consumed, by counterfeit reports
A wound, brought forth on man, illusions for, sanity

Watch for, a fallout
Then see, who you believe in now

I don't need a preacher, for this facade
I don't need your input, on who is my

Collection of lies, with rewards or punishment
Pushed upon, fuck your congregation, I won't be, taken

Watch for, a fallout
Then see, what you believe in now

I don't need a preacher, for this facade
I don't need your input, on who is my God

Believe I won't be recruited, to your artificial creed

Watch for, a fallout
Then see, who you believe in now

I don't need a preacher, for this facade
I don't need your input, on who is my God
I don't need a preacher, for this facade
I don't need your input, on who is my God
