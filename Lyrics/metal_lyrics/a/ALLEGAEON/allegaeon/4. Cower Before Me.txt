With the tyrants rise, so begins the rapture
On winds of disguise, I will return
Congregate the masses, religions join then pass
Hell spawn at my command, so begins my reign of man

Cower before me [x2]
Born in fire, rise from these ashes
Serpent god eternal, power flows through me
Reign in fire, haven to the beast eternal
Rule infernal, cower before me

Follow the chosen one, the prophecy in hand
Forged in fire, encrusted in the barren land
Slaves lashed and broken, beliefs shattered like stone
Foretold by the profit, I stand upon a blood red throne

Cower before me [x2]
Born in fire, rise from these ashes
Serpent god eternal, power flows through me
Reign in fire, haven to the beast eternal
Rule infernal, cower before me

Armies of the dead, my disciples of the dark
Legions of pawns, we prepare to leave our mark
Crusaders of the plague, my warriors of the dark
Legions of rats, prepare for the sacred Reich

The sky bleeds red, on my ascension to the throne
The scriptures, prophesies the chosen ones great demise
I'll lead the vermin, the virus, vile and the human race
I oppose the great sermon, I am the lords disgrace

Cower before me [x2]
Born in fire, rise from these ashes
Serpent god eternal, power flows through me
Reign in fire, haven to the beast eternal
Rule infernal, cower before me
