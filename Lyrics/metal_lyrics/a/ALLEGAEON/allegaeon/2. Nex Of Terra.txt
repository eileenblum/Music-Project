A great storm approaches, and with it death encroaches
In our final hours we are deceived
So with this partial core, dictation will be no more
And shake the foundations of belief

Fire, distaster by thy scene
Fire, releasing the unseen

An era, beyond repair, Chernobyl reigns of terror
Man killed by his own, invention
Damnation marches faster, on the cusp of this great disaster
In the winds ride our asphyxiant

Fire, distaster by thy scene
Fire, releasing the unseen

The end of all, is so beautiful
The man made god machine, is here
So beautiful
Man's greatest achievement, created fear

Did you ever think you'd see, at the turn of the century
Our accelerated march towards domination
Men so blinded by there greed, that they never came to see
Power means nothing, with no civilization

Fire, distaster by thy scene
Fire, releasing the unseen

The end of all, is so beautiful
The man made god machine, is here
So beautiful
Man's greatest achievement, created fear

Countless gone
A necessary gain

Fire, distaster by thy scene
Fire, releasing the unseen

The end of all, is so beautiful
The man made god machine, is here
So beautiful
Man's greatest achievement, created fear
