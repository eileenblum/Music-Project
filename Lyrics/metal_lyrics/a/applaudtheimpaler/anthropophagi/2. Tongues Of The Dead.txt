Like a plague of flies we will swarm
Consuming the flesh of your dead and unborn
Dead men tell no tales
Defile every fucking carcass with a bleeding heart
Dead men tell no fucking tales
Removing the tongues of the dead
And though I ate your brain
Your fading psyche even now still preys
Fucking prey
Like vultures we feast on your corpse
With the flesh removed your bones are contorted
As we ingest your viscera, your cognizance diminishes
I bring forth the plague that now descends upon you
