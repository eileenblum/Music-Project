I've marched across fields of fire
And waded through rivers of blood and bile
There is no god here
How could you be so fucking simple minded
All your life you've been blinded
Your faith is malignant
I have come to realize there's no fucking god (here)
I refuse to believe in your self-proclaimed icons
Bullshit lies, and beliefs
It's not within me
And in the end
No one sacrificed shit for me
