Delusions from ripping you from limb to limb
Detaching your jaw from its hinge
My head begins to spin as your entrails pour
From the wounds I have opened with malicious intent
Endorphins inducing, dismembering
Violently taking its toll upon my perceptiod
This anthropophagic serum takes hold
I'll prove I'm a cannibal when I eat you alive
Now the toxins onset carnage
My hallucinations of your devourment become reality
Chainsaw enema to drain the blood I seek
Carving you from your cunt to your throat
I'll fucking rip you apart
I'll drink the blood from your heart
You'll wish you were dead
When I rip your eyes from your head
