Light... spills out with the landslide
Bleating heroes with single-glazed eyes
Cashing in on the straight side

Stalked out on the threshold
Crashed out with the loving lost souls
Smoked out of the priest hole

Faith... laid out with the average waste
Lapped up by the fair weather fakes
Sold on by the ingrates

Pushed out under false lights
Laughed out on the slandering line
Blanked out of a moment in time
