Chronically underlooked, yet all of it you took
The missing pages from someone else's book
Papered over the cracks in front of their backs
None of you were told to look

Lost you there in the blink of an eye
You took a dive on my blindside, playing for time
Where could I hide in my downtime?

Black lies sigh, aligned across the ocean wide
I'm sat five thousand miles away
The fat cat vies to actify her evil eye
Alikened to vile, confined to the backslide

Narrate my case to the flock behind these ragged gates
Parasites lost, do we stimulate to adulate?
Do we imitate as to accumulate?
Or lie here in wait till the scapegoat escapes?
