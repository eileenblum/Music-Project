Follow me, the way they've told you to be seen
Follow me, and we'll meddle with the stars
Can you believe your jumped-up heroes to be thieves?
Still you long to kiss their apathetic hearts

Everything I need is everything that's killing me
And everything I hear is everything that fed to me
Everything I feel is everything I'm told to be
Everything I see is everything I'm led to believe

Follow me as we soar across this wayward sea
Or there you'll stand, divided from the stars
From what I see there's barely a true soul to reap
Deliberate or sleepwalk through reality

Everything I need everything that's killing me
And everything I hear is everything that's fed to me
In everything I feel that everything's a travesty
With everything there'll always be a light inside of me
