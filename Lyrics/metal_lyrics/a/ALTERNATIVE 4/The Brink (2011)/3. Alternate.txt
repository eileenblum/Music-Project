Break up now, awaken now
Or breakdowns all around
Why tread the ground of joy unfound
Hanging from a half-negated crown?

Break the bounds of dark surrounds
Abdicate in silence, dignified
Oh hark the sound of reptant clowns
Serving up a cold myopic lie

Break it down and change
Fuck comparability
Break it down and change
Break it down and change...

You're safe to walk away
Don't suffer for this scornful masquerade
Stale mates will fall away
Basking in their mindlessness parade

Break it down and change
Reclaim divinity
Break it down and change
Break it down and change.....

Break it down and change
Patch up your dignity
Break it down and change
Break it down and change.....
