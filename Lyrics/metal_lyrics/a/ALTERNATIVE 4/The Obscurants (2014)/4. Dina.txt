Dina, you took me by surprise
How was I supposed to know that our intentions would collide?
A wave of infidelity locked deep within your two-tracked mind
A wave of opportunity embargoed by your jealousy
Consummate de-facto temptress, stimulated tyranny
Simulated chivalry within hyper-reality

Dina, you merciless adulterine
Sanctioning austerity to split popular unity
Disorder and liberty, no sense or sensibility
Occupation therapy in a colony of dignity
A narrow strip of heartless rites and a multitude of human wrongs
A decisive day for a murderous kiss
A derisive way to end a song

Dina, my hands are all I have
Dina, no puedes volver atras
