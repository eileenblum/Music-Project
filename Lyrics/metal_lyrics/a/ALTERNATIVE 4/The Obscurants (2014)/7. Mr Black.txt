Who exchanged this case for revisionary fiction?
Stepping stones for ingrates turning coats for friction
Who trades cries for libel?
Who sells lies to grown men?
Blinded by their idols
Obscuring the light from heaven
Mr Black, your corporation masks the facts
Mr Black, you congregation sadly lacks
Mr Black, so sad to hear you got the sack
Mr Black, no peace at all when there's no crack
