The graceless opportunists bide to hide behind their veils
Tripping globalised betrayal
Braindrain strips away the sane
While alarmists make a killing
From the bloodstained and unwitting
Forbid to coexist
Parasitic figments of deception
Forcing verbal prohibition
A crass indoctrination in this age of mass proscription
