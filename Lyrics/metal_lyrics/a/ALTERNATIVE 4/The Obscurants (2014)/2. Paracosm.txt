Little emperor, naked fomenter
Bare-faced coruminates with the fawner
Laying the blame with the martyrs

Naked emperor, little fomenter
Twin-faced, coruminates with the martyrs
Laying the blame on the fawner

Your past, waiting in the wings
Using flashbacks to draw people into the polarity within
Shooting arrows from the sidelines to fabricate the win

High above your station
Crying down on the selfless few
Self-obsessed pollution
Your sole antagonist is you
Iâve a fairly clear solution
Honour those who have bled for you
Though I have come to the conclusion
Youâll pass the blame no matter who
