It's out, coming out
Spilling down the sides of your mouth
Disclosure, disclosure, incandescent exposure
Just think of the lives you destroyed cos you could
There's no pride in hiding from the blind
Hang yourself out to dry

Disclosure, disclosure
Your guilt-ridden face pasted over and over
Disclose, disclose
The lines are not closed
Disclose, disclose
Inequality control
Disclose, disclose
The millions of whispering souls
Disclose, disclose
When justice was vetoed

It's over, it's over
Numb hearts are growing colder
It's over, it's over
No more looking over my shoulder
It's over, it's over
Understanding growing older
It's over, it's over
This is closure
