I believed for a while that fortune favoured the sly
That we could not rectify what underlies
Retract to our birthright as weâre karmically inclined
Detached above this shell with open eyes
After the flood I resigned
I sat and watched you lie, eye to eye
The graceless blackguard snake was only bleeding me dry
Youâll be creeping through the motions by and by
I gave you a lifeline
A generous alibi
I gave you a lifeline
But now Iâm calling time on the lie
Did you ever think of my life?
Did you ever walk in my side?
Did you ever rue the false light?
No you only bled me dry
I gave you a lifeline
But now Iâm calling time
I gave you a lifeline
And Iâm still mystified as to why
