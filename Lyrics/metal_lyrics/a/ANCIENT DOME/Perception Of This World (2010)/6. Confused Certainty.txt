See just what they want
Make you see to feel safe in your routine day
Ear just what you need
To be sure that you won't ask anything more
Live just as they show
To be sure that you won't need nothing else
Think just as they want
You to think to be free under their own control

But there's something wrong
I feel that it doesn't work
I'm starting to realize
This lie that they called life

Now wake up your mind
Be aware of what you see around you today
Don't try to escape
That's life and you must face this reality
That seems to be hard
To understand when you pay attention on your day
No truth in their face
No words to explain what they are going to do

But there's something wrong
I feel that it doesn't work
I'm starting to realize
This lie that they called life

[Solo: ALE]

So what do you think
About what now you feel inside of you?
Don't seem you to be
Just a being made to nullify our consciousness?
Now that you've realized
This lie made to make you just no one
Be strong, and keep the faith
To survive in this confused certainty

But there's something wrong
I feel that it doesn't work
I'm starting to realize
This lie that they called life
