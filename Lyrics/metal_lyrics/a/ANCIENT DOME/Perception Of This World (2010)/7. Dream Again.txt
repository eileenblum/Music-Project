Another day, another chapter of life
Why do you think you've got no more chance?
Don't pretend that everything goes the right way
And you'll see that something will change...
Emptiness is only a creation of your mind
If you try to see what's behind
Feed your hopes and faith in your dreams
Life's a miracle, so take what it gives

It's time to rise, a time of revenge
So persevere in what you believe!!!

Dream again, and let the sadness far away
Dream again, another great new day on your path

Broken wings, and you cannot fly with your mind
Broken dreams, visions of sad destiny
But don't be afraid, be stronger than everything else
It's always time to create your own fate
Every man plays a role in this life
Every man has a path to find
We are all part of an eternal dream
Carry on against all your fears

It's time to rise, a time of revenge
So persevere in what you believe!!!

Dream again, and let the sadness far away
Dream again, another great new day on your path

[Solo: ALE]

Dream again, and let the sadness far away
Dream again, another great new day on your path
