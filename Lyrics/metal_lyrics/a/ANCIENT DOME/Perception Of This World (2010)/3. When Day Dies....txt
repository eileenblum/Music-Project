[Solo: ALE]

When day dies, when I'm by myself
I feel a need to escape from...
...the life they built, so perfect for me
To satisfy their will of grace
I cannot breath, I cannot dream
I cannot reach what I have inside
A wish for me to set it free
To finally see this ray of life

Can't you feel inside yourself
These feelings to be free?

Free your eyes and begin to see
Mystical dream... when day dies!
Free your mind and begin to think
If you still don't believe... when day dies!

[Solo: ALE]

This pain I live, it's always with me
It's the only thing that seems to be
Ignored by those who look at me
From high above in their stupidity
I'm not alone now that I know
That what we feel (are all the same things)
So now prepare, it's too late for your...
...attempt to excuse, because now we're coming

Can't you feel inside yourself
These feelings to be free?

Free your eyes and begin to see
Mystical dream... when day dies!
Free your mind and begin to think
If you still don't believe... when day dies!
