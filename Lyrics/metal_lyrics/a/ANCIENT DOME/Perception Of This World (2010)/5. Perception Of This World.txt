[Solo: ALE]

Signals from sky and from earth
That we just can't ignore
Strange evolution of lies
It's just a matter of time
The Equilibrium is now dead and gone
There's no solution to stop
What men have been forced to unlock
For the progress of nations
To satisfy all pleasures

Created by men's hopes, but the power rules
The real Perception Of This World
Created by men's hopes, but the power rules
The real Perception Of This World

Crime!!! What's the crime? What gave you a better life?!?!?
Sick!!! Who is sick? Who answered all your needs?!?!?
Blind!!! Who is blind? Benefactors of mankind?!?!?
Think!!! Before you speak... don't show your stupidity!!!

[Solo: PAUL]

Do not try to find solutions, there's no way to turn back now
Too much time spent without thinking to the future generation
Wasted trial to reach perfection, caused by greed and by deception
Step by step deep into a nightmare, symbol of the human idiocy

There is no reason to hope
That the lesson is learned
Blood money speaks for itself
Black gold and then nothing else

Created by men's hopes, but the power rules
The real Perception Of This World
Created by men's hopes, but the power rules
The real Perception Of This World
