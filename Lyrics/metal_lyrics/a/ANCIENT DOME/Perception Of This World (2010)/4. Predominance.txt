I don't know what...
What is that lies behind
The action of a man
Who wants you to kneel down
I'm trying to find
An explanation why
But what comes to my mind
Is that power makes men blind

...Blind!!!!

Seeds of hate
Wherever multiply
It's easy to astray
To abandon the right path
Chaos in life
And Evil roots its lies
No time to hide inside
The demon feeds with crimes

Predominance, no hope no chance
The feeble lies, the strong survives
Predominance, no hope no chance
The key is one: intolerance!!!
Intolerance!!!

Life's cycle closed
A brutal force has opposed
No other way to live
Than bow onto your knees
Indulgence
A term without a sense
Before and after Christ
The only law is to fight

Predominance, no hope no chance
The feeble lies, the strong survives
Predominance, no hope no chance
The key is one: intolerance!!!
Intolerance!!!

[Solo: ALE]

No hope no chance
But just intolerance
No future for a dream
A loss of time indeed
The feeble lies
Only the strong survives
Will we ever see the end?
Will we ever call brother to every man?

Predominance, no hope no chance
The feeble lies, the strong survives
Predominance, no hope no chance
The key is one: intolerance!!!
Intolerance!!!
