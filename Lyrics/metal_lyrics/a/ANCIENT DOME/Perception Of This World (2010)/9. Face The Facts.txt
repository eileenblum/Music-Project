Puppet without self esteem
Ruled by media, corrupted by greed
To think is what you forgot
Blinded by other's thoughts
Truth's pointing you like a sword
But you just cannot accept that you're lost
Lost in a world that's not yours
Prisoner of ancient thorns

Face The Facts!!!
Don't let the truth withdraw from reality
Face The Facts!!!
Never abandon the raw rationality
Face The Facts!!!
Do not permit anyone to manage your mind
Face The Facts!!!
Pure concreteness is what you deserve

Assholes acclaimed like a god
Heroes (and) just men thrown away in the mud
Everything's going upside-down
Kings become clowns
Soldiers of mediocrity
Marching to find the salvation from sins
Proclaiming pure fantasies
Not facts, but dreams

Face The Facts!!!
Don't let the truth withdraw from reality
Face The Facts!!!
Never abandon the raw rationality
Face The Facts!!!
Do not permit to anyone to manage your mind
Face The Facts!!!
Pure concreteness is what you deserve

Connect your sight to your mind
Don't hide yourself behind a veil
An abstract veil without end

Free your soul from the chains
Trapped in a vortex of pain
Facts are faced once again

[Solo: ALE]

Evidence twists in your head
But you deny it with a powerful strength
False words come out from your mouth
Masking your doubts
A verdict will come for us all
And you will see your creations fall down
Inventions of fragile stone
Justice is done

Face The Facts!!!
Don't let the truth withdraw from reality
Face The Facts!!!
Never abandon the raw rationality
Face The Facts!!!
Do not permit to anyone to manage your mind
Face The Facts!!!
Pure concreteness is what you deserve

Face The Facts!!!
