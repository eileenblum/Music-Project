I told myself that I was the only one
I kept my heart in an unreal world
I sacrificed it to obtain renown
And I can feel that all hopes are gone

I will cry... I will lie...
A dark master now justified to kill
You can start dreading me
I will lie...

Now! I understand what is right
The pressure is burning my soul
But I am ready to fight
Thousands of weapons explode
Behind a lie I can feel that
Fear doesn't imprison me
Behind a lie I ignore
Mental disorder no more

[Solo: ALE]

This never world that I desire
It's the only world that lives in my mind
And I can't heal the wounds in my soul
Only a lie will keep me alive

I will cry... I will lie...
A dark master now justified to kill
You can start dread of me
I will lie...
