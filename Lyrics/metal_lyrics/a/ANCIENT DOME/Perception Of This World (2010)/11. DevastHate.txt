There is no war to end all wars
There is no war in the name of God
There's no salvation, no justification
There is no glory in killing someone
Try to find the truth behind this lie
That only shows you what power claims
Rush for control, the money talks
Just an illusion, victims of what?!?!

DevastHate !!! DevastHate !!!
What is destroyed can't be re-created
DevastHate !!! DevastHate !!!
All must be blind, victims of fate

[Solo: LEADER]

Madness of one, millions of dead
Deny the fight with no compromise
Nuclear bombs (and) guided missiles
No! This is not the progress of mankind
Ashes of war upon all nations
Cleansed with words by politicians
Solemn speech full of empty promises
Prepared to hide the umpteenth death-roll

DevastHate !!! DevastHate !!!
What is destroyed can't be re-created
DevastHate !!! DevastHate !!!
All must be blind, victims of fate

[Solo: ALE]

Hate overall is spreading the world
A brain assault straight to the mindless poor
Threshold of madness depicted by mad men
Who can't see further than their little thoughts
God now becomes just an excuse
To justify a thousand abuses
Nightmare on earth, a curtain closed
Please do your best to find out the right cure

DevastHate !!! DevastHate !!!
What is destroyed can't be re-created
DevastHate !!! DevastHate !!!
All must be blind, victims of fate
