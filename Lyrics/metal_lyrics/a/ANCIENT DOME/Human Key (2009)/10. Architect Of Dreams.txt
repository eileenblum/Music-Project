Real, what is real...
...Decide, what is wrong or...
...Right, what is closed to...
...Sight, cannot close your eyes

Is this reality... or just a dream?
Open your eyes... believe to see...

Game, existence is a...
...Game, invention of your...
...Brain, that justify your...
...Blame, you'll never be the same AGAIN!!!

Dreams... Architect of what will be
Mind... State of chaos deep inside

[Solo: PAUL]

Time, now it's time to...
...Try, to find out the...
...Way, to escape the...
...Strange architect's domain

Is this reality... or just a dream?
Open your eyes... believe to see...

Smile, on your face to...
...Hide, an eternal...
...Cry, an eternal...
...Pain, the architect of game... THIS GAME!!!

Dreams... Architect of secret fears
Mind... State of grace within no lies
