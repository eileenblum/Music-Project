Eyes of ice without emotions
Shadows of your past illusions
Of a life of glory and honour
Reflections of your thirst for control

Now this dream has finally fallen
You'll be a servant 'til the judgement
The echoes of your ancient power (are)
Empty words to warn the cowards

[Solo: PAUL]

Will you rise from this decadence?
Will you see again the light?
Will you ever scream for vengeance?
Will you survived this night?..

The answer to all questions lies
Deep inside your hopeless mind
The rush to live on has no price
Breath your last and fade away

TOTAL COMMAND!!!
Brainwashed, now they control your head
TOTAL COMMAND!!!
Victim of unconsciousness
TOTAL COMMAND!!!
A never ending game of pain
TOTAL COMMAND!!!
What did you do to change your past

PAIN, don't think that is just a game
Created by sorrow and hate
HOPE, but that's not enough to survive
The only way out is to fight
DREAM, a lost dream in time and space
A river of thoughts in disgrace
MIND, controlled by the hands of doom
The triumph of madness on you

[Solo: ALE]

Eyes of ice without emotions
Shadows of your past illusions
Of a life of glory and honour
Reflections of your thirst of control

Now this dream has finally fallen
You'll be a servant 'til the judgement
The echoes of your ancient power (are)
Empty words to warn the cowards

TOTAL COMMAND!!!
Brainwashed, now they control your head
TOTAL COMMAND!!!
Victim of unconsciousness
TOTAL COMMAND!!!
Never ending game of pain
TOTAL COMMAND!!!
What did you do to change your past
