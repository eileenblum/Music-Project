Trapped inside myself
I feel a sense of freezing emptiness
Of loneliness...
What's behind this cell
Inhuman flesh, searching for a key
To understand...

Lost... are words
Lost... are thoughts
Lost... is mind
Lost... is soul

Alone, with nothing to tell
Consumed, a monster to shred
Creature, in search for a chance
Realize, there's no way to run

An empire made by words
Cannot be thought by a simple man
Who prays alone
The power of my creed
Embraces my soul, I would better fight proud
With my crown of thorns

Lost... are words
Lost... are thoughts
Lost... is mind
Lost... is soul

Alone, with nothing to tell
Consumed, a monster to shred
Creature, in search for a chance
Realize, there's no way to run

[Solo: PAUL]

Battle will take place
Inside my mind, a new way to be
A new day of light
Deaf to all insults
Stronger than all, sweet desired sensation
Of rebirth

Lost... are words
Lost... are thoughts
Lost... is mind
Lost... is soul

Alone, with nothing to tell
Consumed, a monster to shred
Creature, in search for a chance
Realize, there's no way to run
