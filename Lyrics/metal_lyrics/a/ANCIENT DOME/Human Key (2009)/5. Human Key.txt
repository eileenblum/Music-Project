Father, tell me what will be my future
Father, tell me what will be my role
Father, give me the answers to comprehend
Father, I've the right to know
Now, it's time for me, to understand
Now you have to explain
Why am I submitted to the unknown
Why you leave me alone

Mother cybernetics
You can't create in me an illusion
Of a real life
Mother cybernetics
You can't create in me an illusion
Of a dream coming true in human form

Reborn half man, half machine
A change occurred to be free
A new form of life
Human destiny!!!
Reborn half man half machine
A change occurred to be free
A new form of life
Human dies!!!

[Solo: PAUL]

Son, it's difficult for me to find the way
Son, it's difficult to say
False words are keys of damnation but (are also) compromise
Symbols created to survive
Creatures born by my hand
Power they took is out of control
But son, you will find the way, to save mankind
You, the key to save this world

Mother cybernetics
You can't create in me an illusion
Of a real life
Mother cybernetics
You can't create in me an illusion
Of a dream comes true in human form

Reborn half man, half machine
A change occurred to be free
A new form of life
Human destiny!!!
Reborn half man half machine
A change occurred to be free
A new form of life
Human dies!!!
