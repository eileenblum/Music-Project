And so the story ends
In a breath, a whisper of death
Dark shadows from the past
Lie in (an) emotionless rest
I'm blind and I still can't see
The future of human key
And I can't justify
The price of the sacrifice

NO! MORE! LIES!
The final decay
NO! MORE! PAIN!
The end of domain

[Solo: ALE]

Disconnected from the Core
Central unity falls
Rise of a new engine
The collapse of machines

Years of memories
A picture closed to heart
Nothing is eternal
And everything changes at last
Nothing seems to be born
But a new order has grown
No more lies and no more pain
This is the end of domain

NO! MORE! LIES!
The final decay
NO! MORE! PAIN!
The end of domain
