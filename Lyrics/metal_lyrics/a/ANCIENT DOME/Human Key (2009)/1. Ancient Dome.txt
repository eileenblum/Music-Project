Thrashin' to live
And living to thrash is the way to be
Banging on stage
Feeling the adrenaline while I'm playing
Inside my head
I want to scream just not to become mad
Millions of words
Cannot explain what's the power I hold!!!

Look deep in my eyes, there's a fire
Metal lives again, so bang your head tonight!
Look deep in my eyes, there's a fire
Reach the eternal youth on stage... that's right!

Ancient Dome of thrash
The sound you can't forget
Ancient Dome of thrash
Over and over... again!!!

[Solo: ALE]

No blood, no steel
Dragons and fairies can get me sick
I try to call
But Odin and Thor never answer the phone
No swords and fight
Maybe a movie while I eat french fries
Kings of thy world
My toilet paper has their faces on!!!

Look deep in my eyes, there's a fire
Metal lives again, so bang your head tonight!
Look deep in my eyes, there's a fire
Reach the eternal youth on stage... that's right!

Ancient Dome of thrash
The sound you can't forget
Ancient Dome of thrash
Over and over... again!!!
