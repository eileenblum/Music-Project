Sad and silent dreams torment my nights
Visions of what could have been, another life
But sorrow fades away with the light of a new day
Another chance for me, I'll be prepared

In a cold September, thinking of a past delight
Deep inside me, I feel an un-broken cry
Disillusions, of an eternal life
If I could retry, I will not miss you once again

Narrow is the way, my only strength is my faith
Walking through this path, careless of what people say
Every tear I've never cried is hidden deep into my mind
I will never feel the cold, I'll never be alone

In a cold September, thinking of a past delight
Deep inside me, I feel an un-broken cry
Disillusions, of an eternal life
If I could retry, I will not miss you once again

[Solo: PAUL]

In a cold September, thinking of a past delight
Deep inside me, I feel an un-broken cry
Disillusions, of an eternal life
If I could retry, I will not miss you once again
