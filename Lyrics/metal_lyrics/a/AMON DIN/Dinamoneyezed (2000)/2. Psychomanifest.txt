In Adventure of colours and shadows
I'm flying beyond the Future
Creating something imaginary
Exploring through secrets of my unconsciousness

Imaginary chaos is making my sane
I'm feeling pleasure in my own galaxy
Something psychedelic is widening my conscious
I'm feeling like visionaire from star labyrinth

Colours starting to be so secretly
In the middle of impulsive sparkings
Flash of new colours is driving me mad
With roots, things, waves and bodies in front of me

Inexplicabled laboratory, is here
In different levels of my brain
Which is very shell
But they seem so wide to me

I'm sinkin' in madness
But stubbornness and desire is making it possible
It's all comin' down to line
Is this my own psychomanifest!?
