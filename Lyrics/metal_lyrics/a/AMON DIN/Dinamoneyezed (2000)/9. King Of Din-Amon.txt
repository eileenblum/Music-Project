Life-something supreme
the energy of the whole universe
Inexplicable perfection of his creation
knowledge-purpose of existence
The beauty of the beauty
of his creation
death-logical continuation of the previous

He keeps still and is always on the go
Changes not himself but is a cause of all changes
His eternal, present everywhere
He is the father of all, the mother of everything

Love-love the source of life
Strength, which his power breaths with
Death he presents his subjects
Truth-purity of soul,
light stronger than the Sun's
His ultimate weapon
Goodness-the greatness of man
Do experience it

He's the father of all, the mother of everything
He is the origin and purpose of enlightenment
The crator of kingdom supreme
He is the king of Din-Amon

In this time of darkness and misery
When everything perverses, when Yes becomes No
We have to find the strength for us all
And join around shining wise head

Though I know not of his place
Though I know not of his face
To his will I let myself
And believe to the Holy Head!

Your serene highness, you have mine loyalties!
