I am the past
I feel the groan in my chest
Human stench all over the world
Blind my eyes and exert my soul
Lies, greed and senseless death
I'm in dread of insanity of man

Over and over again
Pleasure turns into pain
Time and time again
Love turns into hate
Wise men die in vain
I'm sick of all these deaths
people are gripped with fear
Faith fades, the end is near!
