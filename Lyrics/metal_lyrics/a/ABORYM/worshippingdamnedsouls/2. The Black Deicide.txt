The Black Deicide
Iâm merged into the shadows
Into an endless silence
Shut into the crypt of sorrow
Submitted to an altar

Blood! Blood! Blood!
Iâm THE BLACK DEICIDE

A strange sensation
Penetrate into my mind
I want to escape
I want to die

Blood! Blood! Blood!
Iâm THE BLACK DEICIDE

My soul is dead
My eyes are black
Iâm starting now
My journey out

My shadow is different from me
It reflects the image of Satan
My eyes keep on watching
The glorious image of Satan

Blood! Blood! Blood!
Iâm THE BLACK DEICIDE
