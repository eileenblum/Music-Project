[Music: M.Fabban / Nysrok, Lyrics: M. Fabban, April 2005]

[Cultoculus spoken vocals:]
All the great things at the beginning
must dress monstrous and terrifying masks
to impress their mark on humanity

All the great things at the beginning
must dress monstrous and terrifying masks
to impress their mark on humanity

Listen children!
This is the sound of death!
In the long run we are all dead
Death..to stop sinning suddenly
Listen!
This is the sound of the panic!
The sound of the night?

Shamanic hysteria in a schizophrenic movement
Going down, down and down
in the meanders..
Have you never felt your soul?
Which is the colour of your suffering?
In the darkness we felt the final vision
..et Satan ridet..
..et Satan ridet..
..et Satan ridet..

This world..an energetic-creature
Without a beginning?
Without an end
..et Satan ridet..
..et Satan ridet..
..et Satan ridet..

This is the sound of the rebellion!
The world want to fight or to fuck
This is the sound of the rebellion!
To love or to kill
This is the sound of the rebellion!
..the ceremony has begun
This is the sound of the rebellion!
..men against men..

This is the sound of the rebellion!
