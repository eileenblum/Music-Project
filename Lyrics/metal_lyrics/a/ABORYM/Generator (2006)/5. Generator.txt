[Music: M. Fabban / Nysrok, Lyrics: M. Fabban, March 2005]

Spirit's molecules floats in the cosmos
(while) the dead white man stand upon his burning bed
Death used its dices one time more and he fucked us all!
and the gates are open

Spirit's molecules floats in the cosmos
(while) the dead white man stand upon his burning bed
death used its dices one time more and he fucked us all!
and the gates are open

[Cultoculus &amp; M. Fabban chorus:]
Bellum omnium contra omnes
Bis vincit qui se vincit in victoria

the Container is empty
the spirit start to explore the never ending valley
where the dead-man walking touch the sun

Strong is the Karnix cry coming from the Vril
Refugium Peccatorum
peccatorum!

Air is dirty.. radioactive and cold
Millions and millions of candles
Millions and millions of dead

echoes from the terrestrial surface
digital vibes, electric impulses and grey lights

generated from the earth's vomit
and the dead white man is walking
immortal? down?
...when illusions lives through its vis logica
giving back to earth a useless projection

While the dead white man stand upon his burning bed
everything is moving down
in the meanders of the Planet Satan!!
Good and Evil's assemblage
velocity and chaos
they can combine!!!

The world is his representation
the dead white man is not in the world
the world is inside him.
