[Music: M. Fabban / Nysrok, Lyrics: Bard G. Eithun, April 2005]

Betrayal - a lone soldier
Prepared for the last call
Solitude - the highest fate
Conclude everything and all

Death in the wastelands
Herald the last standing
Obey the first born
Our world will be torn

Conflict - a movement of free
Signal the coming

Gratification - a battered fight
I think you better sharpen the knife

Master and Slave
Increase, full on

Stupid or brave
Shrieking

Hardcore - for legends
Rise from ashes
Semigod - end of days
No more praise

Suffer no more
Catalyst for once and for all
Stop dreaming
A will to be free

[Fabban latin chorus:]
Omnia munda mundis

Death in the wastelands
Herald the last standing
Obey the first born
Our world will be torn

Conflict - a movement of free
Signal the coming
