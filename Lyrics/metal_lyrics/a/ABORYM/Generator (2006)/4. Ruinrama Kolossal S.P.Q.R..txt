[Music: Nysrok, Lyrics: Angy, April 2005]

[Fabban Latin chorus:]
Nihil Morte Certium!
Nihil Morte Certium!

Defective-arid-perspective
Aphonic-apostate-anthem
Liturgical chemical Psalm
Martyr crucified Plasma
Propeller ov insects/screens
Converter ov tubular engine
Valvular mechanism: infested!
Globular filters: meshed!
Under exposed organic trasmutation
Ensnared-enslaved-enshrouded-corroded flesh

Stench ov God, clinical deceit ov a doctrine
Proudly falling in transmission closedown
Ecstatic diving in heretical channel
Deeply drowning in the void ov disturbance
Stifling cells stun the structure
Myriad ov foresights on cosmic cross
Brimstone-ferrous breath near putrefying sweat

Decrepit denied humans play ground
The magic disposal: no order above borders
Magnetic axis invokes rusted nails

Inhale the sulphur - declare the virus
Optical restless disgust, The onward travel - a transcendent discover
Enraptured altered state - undefined measure: defined
Infinite drifting towards no land

Unbearable weight ov chains to dim
Craving for acid rains in oxidized veins

Decrepit denied humans play ground
The magic disposal: no order above borders
Magnetic axis invokes rusted nails

(falling into the acid-hell, screamings and drunky vocals by CultoCulus)
