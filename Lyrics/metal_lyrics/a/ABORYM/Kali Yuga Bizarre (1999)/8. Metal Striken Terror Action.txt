[Lyric by Malfeitor Fabban, 1995, Music by Malfeitor Fabban 1993]

the God-shit is a simmetrical cell
so many childbed manteins tumescent
I.N.R.I. piss on the Sun-fascination
(in) the age of the midland genetic pollution

trust in madcap holy right...holy lord, grisly creation of sintethic asshole
trust in madcap holy right...holy lord, grisly creation of sintethic pressure
Kali Yuga Athanor - to support! Bringing the tool of the mind's understanding
Kali Yuga Athanor - to support! Bringing the tool of the mind's understanding

innatural deicide... witching surround
in fractal eons makes the tomahawk prevails
forbidden embrasure of total submission!
and ya have just one hour in my snuf-pervertion

the uprightness creation
is divine interjaction
you tramble and tramble
(you are only) fetus unborn!

this is our declaration of war!
join us and commit suicide!
