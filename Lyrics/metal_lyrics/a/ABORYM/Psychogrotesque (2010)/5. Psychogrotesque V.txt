[Additional electronics-beats by Narchost / Saxophone by Marcello Balena]

If I could breathe the hate I found in humanity
I would be suffocated by its virulent fogs
If I could live in my way - no mercenaries
I would count on the pain, the only thing I own
I am a man... I am without a leg
If I look down I realize that I don't even have the other one
I am a legless man and I don't have my left arm
I don't have the right one either and I have no spinal column
I have no hands... I don't have eyes...I don't have hair
there's a lack of nose and ears in my face, I can't see anything of me: I am a black fly
I am misery: I am nothing: you made me a ânon-manâ dear doctor world
and if I transgress against your catechism I hope many will follow me!
If I exist I am no one else: I don't acknowledge in me this equivocal pluralism
My subjectivity and the Creator it's way too much for just a brain
this place... in where huge instinctive pulsions are lost: here there is the Final Apocalypse
