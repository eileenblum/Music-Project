Every single thing is static
in my nightmares iron skeletons want to touch me
huddled up in a corner I hear just my mourn of a man
that step by step turns into a kid's mourn, that step by step turns into a baby's mourn
that step by step turns into a fly's buzz... What am I now?

[Solo Hell:IO:Kabbalus]

His smell gives me nausea and it's impressed in my mind
in between the dream and the refuse of what dawn will bring
wrong! and I did it again! Sacrifice! In the name of corruption
wrong! and I did it again! Psychogrotesque fairytale
wrong! and I did it again! Sacrifice! For all the puppets hanged down their lies
wrong! and I did it again! Atavistic daily disgrace
humanity - perpetual carnality / insanity - perpetual carnality
wrong! and I did it again! Sacrifice! In the name of madness and free-doom
wrong! and I did it again! Psychogrotesque fairytale
wrong! and I did it again! Sacrifice! Spiritual harlotry
wrong! and I did it again! Lobotomized neurotic youth
