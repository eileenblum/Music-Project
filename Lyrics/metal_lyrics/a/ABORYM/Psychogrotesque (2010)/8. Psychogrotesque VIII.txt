My back is up against the wall everywhere lobotomized fall
the sadistic power game they play dirty methods they will put in my way
a cultured abominable instinct of suicide
injected in my dried veins: no hope to survive

sick synthetic conspiracy: a state of siege
loaded as I am of the scorn for despicable hearts - I'm a nest in flames

My back is up against the wall everywhere lobotomized fall
the sadistic power game they play dirty methods they will put in my way
a cultured abominable instinct of suicide
injected in my dried veins: no hope to survive
