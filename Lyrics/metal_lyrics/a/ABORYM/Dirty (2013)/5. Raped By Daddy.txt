[Music Fabban/Paolo Pieri - lyrics Fabban]

2481 / Garmonbozia!
2481 / Garmonbozia!
2481 / Garmonbozia!

The man behind the mask
is looking for the book with the pages torn out
He is going towards the hiding place
He is under the fan now

2481 / Garmonbozia!
2481 / Garmonbozia!
Do you know who I am?
I am the arm
Fell a victim. Electricity
2481 / Garmonbozia!
2481 / Garmonbozia!
Raped by daddy!
You were raped by daddy!

Laura lays back on her bed and spread her legs
2481 / Garmonbozia!
2481 / Garmonbozia!
