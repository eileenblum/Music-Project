[Music Paolo Pieri/Fabban - lyrics Fabban]

Anything and everything is meaningless
I had a dream which was not at all a dream
I was lifted up on a rarefied atmosphere
Darkness stole my certainties across the universe

Now I see... the pain all falls behind
Our nightmares are in our sights
Now I see... behold the disgrace of our lives

In space, a vengeful fleet waited
Then the furred strangers arrived with a plan to save Earth's children
But the General wasn't sure if he could trust an Alien offer

Millions of lights we have never seen
I approach this in a state of trance
Hyperfast unreal journey across the universe

Sucking hallucinatory acid in the system

Now I see a red light from the satellite
Little gods are trying to escape by flying away
A star is only glitters when it shatters in the night
Their capsules are burning swallowed by the dark
