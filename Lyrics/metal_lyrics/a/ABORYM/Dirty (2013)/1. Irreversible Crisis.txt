[Music Paolo Pieri/Fabban - lyrics Fabban]

You know what? Fuck you! Let's play this fucking game!
Doomsday befalls. Hell rages on the face of the Earth
Will humanity correct decades of lies, hoaxes and failures
or is it the last light before darkness?

Things are getting out of control
Lost cause situations
propaganda controls
Global crisis, knocking at your door

Scream if you want to
the sky is going to crush you
Rights stripped into nonexistence
politicians don't care

Ultraviolet radiations
collapsing banks
They want you to swim in their toxic waste

A black mist and sickening fog of lies
(this world want to fuck you!)
Disasters ruled by bloodshed
irreversible crisis

This world want to fuck you!
to disrupt the fucking empire
This world want to fuck you!
to forge an underground
This world want to fuck you!
to engage the fucking enemy
This world want to fuck you!
We create two, three, many Vietnams

This world want to fuck you!
Desanctification of the empire
This world want to fuck you!
Look down at me and you see a fool
This world want to fuck you!
Look up at me and you see a God
This world want to fuck you!
Look straight at me and you see yourself

Too much pain to keep up the fight
No faith to believe there's time
irreversible crisis
Everything is built on slavery, domination and death
Irreversible crisis
A joyride to the gates of hell

This world want to fuck you!
This world want to fuck you!

[Paolo Pieri's guitar solo]

This world want to fuck you!
Turning weakness into strength
This world want to fuck you!
The war to explain the war
This world want to fuck you!
