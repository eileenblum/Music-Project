[Music Fabban/Paolo Pieri - lyrics Fabban]

When misfortunes covered your life
when the air cuts like a knife
when it's cloudy and cold outside
When you hear all those people smile
and you only want to die
when no one is by your side
Turning pages over
run away to nowhere
and it's hard to take control
When you have no memories
When you reach the point of no return
It's the day the sun stopped shining

[Fabban's synth solo]
