[Music Fabban/Paolo Pierri - lyrics Fabban]

You are dirty. Scared. Terrified
You lick your wounds on the edge of chasm
Lacerated microcephalic blind morons
sociopathics phenomenal psychotics praying at your doorstep

Your friends, your co-workers, newspapers, the TV
Everybody's happy to talk, full of misinformation
Morality, science, religion, politics, Christ, It's overwhelming!

You are dirty. Empty. Shivery.
Virtue is dead. And God is blind when you're terrified.
Therapeutic treatments don't work at all
They've given birth to weird things, Watch'em unveil

People can flaunt their money and be at the top 1%
of this shameful, violent, prejudiced, illiterate
sexually repressed, ineffectual, bad-smelling, self-righteous
dirty brothel we call home

You are dirty. Scared
Listen to your torment while sleeping with the guns
It means nothing much this life
Era vulgaris of chrism decline

[Paolo Pieri's guitar solo]

You are dirty. Dying. Torn between lies.
The sedation of piety. The seclusion of light.
Soon we'll turn to dark
And where have all the angels gone?
We are a unforeseen called human beings
