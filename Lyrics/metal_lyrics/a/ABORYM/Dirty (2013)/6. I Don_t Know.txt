[Music Fabban/Paolo Pieri - lyrics Fabban]

I don't know exactly what a prayer is
inner turbulence: the only thing I feel
No birth, no death, no time nor sun, a virtual life
zombies are coming, I don't know where to hide

There is no more room in hell
that's why they threw me here
in the city of fear

masturbated by electric ghosts
with your pictures in my head
bloody skyline, first sign of an apocalyptic age to come
Please stop saying everything's ok
the radioactive fear is slowly killing me

I don't know what I've become
And I don't know what the hell I'm hoping for
I don't even know why it matters anymore
I don't know if to sleep or wake up
and I don't know how to clear my head
I'm getting worse, I'm buried in my bed

[Fabban's synth solo]

Thousands of blackbirds fall to their death
an epidemic, the rape of planet Earth
Even all the strongest rain can't take my pain away
I don't know anything, the sun can only decay

Everyone's sleeping with sorrow
don't you fight, we lost the way
still we believe there is a tomorrow
but I would climb my way...
I don't know...
I don't know...

[Paolo Pieri's guitar solo]
