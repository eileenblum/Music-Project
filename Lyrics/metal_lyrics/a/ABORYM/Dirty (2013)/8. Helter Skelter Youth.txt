[Music Fabban/Paolo Pieri - lyrics Fabban]

Kill the light a little more
Fuck the sun. Avoid facing the wall
People wanna fight or fuck... love or kill
Everything's gonna burn
The planet's screaming for change

Swimming in pesticide, breathing ashes,
chemical tears and walls of flesh
fucked up generation: join us for a narrow mind!
We don't lie, we don't cry, we are not dead enough for this life
No matter if the sun doesn't shine, neon lights we can combine

Running on blood, swallowing poisons, biomechanical hearts
fucked up grey generation: it's a mission and a half!

We were programmed to believe there is not any fucking God
We are fusion of future, present and past: join us for a narrow mind!
We create, we combine, we claim our rules in life
We're running out of new ideas for the ownership of our pride
Don't be a fool. Please stop caring. Put yourself on auto-response
Realize most fears are illusory. Stop betraying yourself!

Debug your mind
Avoid facing the wall

Is everybody in?
You are alive by confronting death, by experiencing pain

Let's create the myths
Nailed arms that chained you, eyes that lied
To our freedom we must ride the pain inside
the time of heroes is dead... and gone
