[Music Fabban/Paolo Pieri - lyrics Fabban]

The fatal sounds of broken dreams
It's a crushed panic
I sense our mission is coming demolition
What the fuck is going on?

Life, memories, gone!

All rise watching the light that burns your eyes
All these terrified battered voices up in the sky
you pray, you are surrounded by fear
Lay down, think about what you have done, wait for the end to come

Face to face, the sacred why, feel the chill, face the light

Where are we now? Non-ionizing radiations
deafening hush in a white desert
Between the shades, the face's standing still
Face the reptile, all our dreams were doomed to fail
I feel so unpure

Life, memories, gone!
I know I'm going under
Like in a hypnotic journey
I am mesmerized

We struggled for power to control the world
We are energy for lizards now
We have studied something that were studying us
The soul of man was made to walk the skies
We failed. I can't go back and I won't go back to you

[Fabban synth solo / Paolo Pieri's guitar solo]

All rise watching the light that burns your eyes
All these terrified battered voices up in the sky
you pray, you are surrounded by fear
Lay down, maybe that's not the end but a new life to come
