For the last time I am alone
For the last time It feels so cold
It's the last time
Now she has gone

But then... the sky answers

Rain
Rain is falling down on me
Here comes the rain

For a moment I hear a prayer
Just a moment but It's so clear
You're calling me
You're touching me
Oh it hurts deep down

Your soul is so lost without me
But I can't recall your eyes
Oh... hold me and kiss me
Please take me with you

Frail threshold of sanity
The nightmare became so real
But all the tears,
The pain we feel
Are washed by the...

Rain
Rain is falling down on me
Here comes the rain
For the last time
