Step back! The trees guard the way
And the wind's full of voices no soul's ever heard
They sing forever their secret tale
On this place blessed by nightfall they embrace your gait

I've walked across all forests
Their beauty is killing me

For those who'll never see the mountains
Forever my eyes have been broken
For those who'll never see the mountains
Forever my soul has been broken
It's broken down

You've felt the beating
Under the barks
Those who were silent (You've chosen to wander)
Now chant loud in you (Forlorn? Lost?)

This time the breeze won't take their pain from me
This time I want their tears to stay in my heart

I cry for those who'll never see the mountains
Forever my eyes have been broken
I cry for those who'll never see these mountains
Forever my soul has been broken
It's broken down
