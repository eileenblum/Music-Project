The world stopped
A raindrop fell over your cheek
As winds off shore caressed your hair
I knew the mastery of pain

Like the cold snow shelters the evergreen leaves
Just before the sun takes it away
So our time won't last for evermore
But don't fear the night
The essence never dies

Don't you see that our love is real
In your eyes, beyond this life
Don't you see that this love is real
In your eyes, it will never die

I wish this could be true
The mastery of pain

Inside
The essence never dies
Deep inside
The essence never dies

Please don't give me more thoughts pure
I don't want anything but you
Please don't leave this world of doom
I can't live without your voice
You're a fire in the sky
I will crush heavens to dust
'Cause I need your love - I need you
I need you to be free - I need you

Don't you see that our love is real
In your eyes, beyond this life
Don't you see that this love is real
In your eyes, it will never die

Inside
The essence never dies
Inside
The essence never dies

I wish this could be true...
