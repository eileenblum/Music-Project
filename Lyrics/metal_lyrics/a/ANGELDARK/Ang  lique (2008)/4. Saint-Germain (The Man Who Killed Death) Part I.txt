I've found that silver knife
Laying heartless in my palm
Your blood doesn't stain its blade
Who are you?

Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Let me reach for your beauty again
Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Like a shadow your vision's in me

I've got to kill a man who killed death
I've got to kill... The Man Who Killed Death

You've taken her from me
I'll give you hell for it
Don't say she's just my dream
... is this real?

A new world, gold-shining
A hope beyond this land
An angel, gold-shining
Salvation in her eyes...

A new lie, gold-shining
A puppet in their hands
Illusions, gold-shining
Created in your mind

I've got to kill a man who killed death
I've got to kill... The Man Who Killed Death

There's a darkened space inside me
Made of memories of you
The trail you left behind
Those seven doors I'll walk through
Out of this wasted land... to you

Give me strength to break the gates
Beyond the sky
Where your soul remains still
Far from the dome of life and death
I'm still with you

Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Let me reach for your beauty again
Angelique, show me the way
The way out of here
Like a shadow your vision's in me
