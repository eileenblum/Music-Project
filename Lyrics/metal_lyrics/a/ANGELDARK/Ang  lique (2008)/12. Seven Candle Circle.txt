Waiting under starlight
To feel your white shining
My life has no meaning
Without dreaming of you

This is the circle where souls bleed for love
Inside this circle we die now

Seven demons from heaven
Wings of a raven in descent
I was just a weak pawn
With a heart torn for you

This is the circle where souls bleed for love
Inside this circle we die now
This is the circle where all hopes are lost
Inside this circle we die now

Crossing through the archway
Seven are gathered here
The cloister vibrates with the sound

This score is a path that
leads me astray from you
Please forgive what I have to do

In quo est salus, vita, et resurrectio

This is the circle where souls bleed for love? for you
This is the circle where all hopes are lost
Inside this circle we die now

Cursed by the light, Damned by the night
