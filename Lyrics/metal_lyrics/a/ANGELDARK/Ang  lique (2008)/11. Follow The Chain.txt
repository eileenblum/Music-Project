Surrounded by the ocean wind
Mortal Silence takes me
Over my lonely trail

Reddish sand is hiding the trace
Taken by the traveller god

Empty eyes fixed on a tragedy
Mirrored from a distance beside you

Reddish sand is hiding the trace
Taken by the traveller god

Follow the chain one more autumn
I never wanted to lose my faith
But still tomorrow
Another link will join this endless chain

I can see you
Roaming through the track
Like a Timewalker
yearning for his time

Make for the chain end
Out of this world
Reliving grief and madness
Wishing to stay
Embraced by the sea

Follow the chain one more autumn
I never wanted to lose my faith
But still tomorrow
Another link will join this endless trail of sorrow
