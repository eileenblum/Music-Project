Don't speak so bravely about death
It's just another empty word to me
Created by weak souls and dreaming fools like you
I'm not the one to fear
I shouldn't be your enemy
But be aware of what I say
Or we'll play my game

The ages rise and fall before me
One thousand times I've seen your suffering
A reason to live for
...Or a lie to fight for?
The way to wisdom is a weapon
The seven secrets are eternal might
But maybe it's just your mind
Playing tricks on you

I know that she is nigh
The chalice takes me high
I feel the living stars
The universe aligned
Oh... the infinity
Angelique...

Angelique
Come to me
Embrace my pain
It can't be the last time
Angelique
I bleed for you
Please don't go

I've got to kill a man who killed death
I've got to kill... The Man Who Killed Death
