The raven's lonely flight
The throne where you're supposed to be
It's just a thorn, a crime
There's no forgiveness

This is all my spirit has
A sacred place for you and me
Forgotten and betrayed
I tried to hold it

This crystal grave was built for you
Of haze as wolves cried to the moon
This dying rose I give to you
It's made of my blood?
Now it belongs to you

The velvet kiss of rain
The moment when the angels sing
You did it all in vain
Nothing's there for you

High is the price I have to pay
My sin was to behold your eyes
When darkness blinds the day
So cruel and distant

It seems you don't understand
That the gods don't need your cries
You've kissed her hand for the last time
The last time, my son

Wake frozen dusk, haven of souls
Tear up my heart, your sign will rise
Black corvine eyes wait as my hope
Silently dies... now

Death and love dance in your name
Like tears in the stream
Both the hunter and the prey
Fell in love with the knife's blade

I will search for you forever in this maze
I won't break this vow

This crystal grave was built for you
Of haze as wolves cried to the moon
This dying rose I give to you
It's made of my blood?
Now it belongs to you
As shades are gathering
Around our hearts

The seventh circle in darkness is rising
The circle is rising
Now the source is dying down
