Immortal name, immortal fame
His face will be wherever you are
Awake the wolf that's on your heart
It will protect your deepest desires

Have you ever felt that rain?
Water flowing through its veins
I cry feeding its fate
Inside your dreams

The shadow will roam till death embraces your soul
Dawn will come, dream this night
Alone with your tears, alone with your fears
Lost in memories you have just lived

On this rainy night I pray
To find you one day
Show me the way I must walk
In this humid shelter I pray
To feel you again
And to discover your light

Growing life beside your life
Eternal cycle under the skies
Sometimes the bright snows refresh its skin
Watch Spring weaving the silk
Enchanted by delightful charm
Sometimes its Autumn leaves caress the air
