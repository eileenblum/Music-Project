Solitude's my epitaph
I've been dying within
Secrets kept inside tattoed my skin
Still darkness dwells in me

Born in everlasting mists
Endless quest for truth I am
In the shrine of gloom I cry

Chase the dark
Bring the end
Stormcloud winter is my reign
Against the coldest winds I run
Alone until the day I die

I'm alone

From the abyss came forth my love
Never meant to be real
From the embers of my soul to you
Drifts me far away

Fading echoes
Havoc revealed
No more concealed by
An ephemeral life
What makes a man try to fight for absolution?
Show him the flame
Then let him set himself on fire

In astral silence we stand
I feel your grief in me
To cherish all your tears
I'm here with you now

Trapped beyond my inner doubts
I've been searching in vain
Now the answers lie behind these staves
The path I walk is my own

Born in everlasting mists
Endless quest for truth I am
In the shrine of gloom I cry

Chase the dark
Bring the end
Stormcloud winter is my reign
Against the coldest winds I run
Alone until the day I die
