Disassociate, try not to feel
Pay no attention to it
It won't seem real
A blind eye enables what we quell
Then nature takes it course
And breaks your will

I can't pick up the pieces
As fast as you throw them away
I can't hold you together
If you don't want to stay

Don't want to be your light
I burned myself so much I died inside
So what is left of me?
A bitter broken memory
Don't want to live your life
I can no longer even sympathize
With what you've come to be
A bitter broken memory

Here we are
You expect me to face hell's fury
I set fire
Sharing the pieces of your heartache
I'm imperfect too, a jaded monster just like you
I can barely fake it for me
And I won't play the game for the benefit of you

And I can't pick up the pieces
As fast as you throw them away
I can't hold you together
If you don't want to stay

Don't want to be your light
I burned myself so much I died inside
So what is left of me?
A bitter broken memory
Don't want to live your life
I can no longer even sympathize
With what you've come to be
A bitter broken memory

Don't want to be your light
I burned myself so much I died inside
So what is left of me?
A bitter broken memory
Don't want to live your life
I can no longer even sympathize
With what you've come to be
A bitter broken memory

A bitter broken memory
A bitter broken memory
