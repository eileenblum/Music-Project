(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)

(I'm living recklessly)
(I'm living recklessly)

A BLACK HOLE, A RAGING RIVER
THE VOID INSIDE OF ME
Compelling me, driving me, I'm incomplete
Molding me, holding me up on my fate

There's something about
The wind in the trees
It's haunting to me
Despair in the air, anxiety on the breeze
There's something about
The sound of the waves
It holds me under
It never takes
It's getting the best of me, I'm living recklessly

A BLACK HOLE, A RAGING RIVER
THE VOID INSIDE OF ME
Compelling me, driving me, I'm incomplete
Molding me, holding me up on my fate

I'm living recklessly
I'm living recklessly

This hideous creation, self made
Beautiful inspiration, I'm plagued
(Day by day)
I'm hostage to my own creation
(Day by day)
I'm possessed, an abomination

Somewhere beyond
And past the point of nothing left
It will fuel me on
It will give me a new breath, go

And from the pages
Of ancient prophecy
A mythical plague
Propels my destiny
The betrayer of man
Forced a quest for certainty
Never asking myself
What beats inside of me
Never asking my soul
What hides inside of me
I won't break so easily
I choose my own direction

I can't stop (No)
Can't stop my evolution
I can't stop (No)
Can't stop this revolution
I can't stop (No)
Can't stop my evolution
I can't stop (No)
Can't stop this revolution
Go
