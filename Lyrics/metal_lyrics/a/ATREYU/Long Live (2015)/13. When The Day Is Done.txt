[Best Buy Edition Bonus Track]Feels like I'm falling face first
Down a flight of stairs
My jaw breaks the fall
My teeth are everywhere
But I'm a quick study
Pain doesn't bother me
It teaches me lessons
Corrects the weakness within

[Chorus:]
When the day is done
I'll stand triumphantly
When the day is done
I won't be washed away
After I fall
I'll fly on broken wings

(Whoa)
DREAMS COME TRUE
BUT NOTHING VENTURED NOTHING GAINED

I reject this risk nothing society
Pain building character
Teaching humility
I reject the weakness living inside of me
Pain building character
Teaching humility

I won't be led astray
In our culture that is so insane
No guts no glory (NO GUTS NO GLORY)
No pleasure no pain (NO PLEASURE NO PAIN)
Everyday you have
You've got to step up to the plate

[Chorus:]
When the day is done
I'll stand triumphantly
When the day is done
I won't be washed away
After I fall
I'll fly on broken wings

(Whoa)
DREAMS COME TRUE
BUT NOTHING VENTURED NOTHING GAINED

(Hey) accept the pain, breathe it in, and walk away
(Hey) accept the pain, breathe it in, and walk away
(Hey) accept the pain, breathe it in, and walk away
(Hey) accept the pain, breathe it in, and walk away
(Hey) accept the pain, breathe it in, and walk away

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
When the day is done
I'll stand triumphantly
When the day is done
I won't be washed away
After I fall
I'll fly on broken wings

(Whoa)
DREAMS COME TRUE

BUT NOTHING VENTURED NOTHING GAINED
