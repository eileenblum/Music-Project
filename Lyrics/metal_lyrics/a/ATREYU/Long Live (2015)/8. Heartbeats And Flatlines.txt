Lie down, curl up in a ball
You'll never even need to crawl
Strive for shit, slave to it
You're working for the means to an end
Build walls and watch bridges fall
So hungry for the new next best
Strive for shit, slave to it
You're working for the means to an end

[Chorus:]
DOES YOUR HEART HAVE A BEAT?
DOES IT JUST SIT IN YOUR CHEST?
CROWDING YOUR SOUL, TAKING SPACE
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A PLACE TO DECAY
THERE IS MORE TO THIS LIFE
THAN THE FLESH AND THE PAIN
WHO KEEPS CARVING THEIR MARK ON YOUR FATE?
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A PLACE TO DECAY

To decay

Wide open skies (Wide open skies)
A billion dreams or dead stars in the night
Exploding cannonballs
Breaking down the walls between you and life
It's time to open up your eyes
To cut all strings and die
To draw the fucking line
Between the living and alive

[Chorus:]
DOES YOUR HEART HAVE A BEAT?
DOES IT JUST SIT IN YOUR CHEST?
CROWDING YOUR SOUL, TAKING SPACE
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A PLACE TO DECAY
THERE IS MORE TO THIS LIFE
THAN THE FLESH AND THE PAIN
WHO KEEPS CARVING THEIR MARK ON YOUR FATE?
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A PLACE TO DECAY

Your greed
Our greed
Consumes
Everything

[Solo:]

[Chorus:]
DOES YOUR HEART HAVE A BEAT?
DOES IT SIT IN YOUR CHEST?
CROWDING YOUR SOUL, TAKING SPACE
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A PLACE TO DECAY
THERE IS MORE TO THIS LIFE
THAN THE FLESH AND THE PAIN
WHO KEEPS CARVING THEIR MARK ON YOUR FATE?
WHILE YOU WAIT FOR A PLACE TO DECAY

LIE
