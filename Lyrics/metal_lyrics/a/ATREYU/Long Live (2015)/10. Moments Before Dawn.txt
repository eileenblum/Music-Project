He falling's out, but we'd be back
Like a gunshot that may have hurt less
Than the words I caught in the chest as your body rot
I tried to catch you but I keep my heart locked

I fall through the floor
Hell can hurt like this

[Chorus:]
All the things I'll never say, the way it never plays (never plays)
Out the way I see it in my head
The pain, the way it haunts me lingering for days (lingering)
No funeral for what it could have been

Paralyzed again, engaged on the auto pilot
We can fight it but it's hard to hide it
Trying to deny the loss
Trying to hide the fact that

I haven't slept for days
(I HAVEN'T SLEPT FOR DAYS)
And you won't stop crying
(AND YOU WON'T STOP CRYING)
These moments before dawn
I'd rather be dying

I fall through the floor
Hell can hurt like this

[Chorus:]
All the things I'll never say, the way it never plays (never plays)
Out the way I see it in my head
The pain, the way it haunts me lingering for days (lingering)
No funeral for what it could have been

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
All the things I'll never say, the way it never plays (never plays)
Out the way I see it in my head
The pain, the way it haunts me lingering for days (lingering)
No funeral for what it could have been

I haven't slept for days
And you won't stop crying
These moments before dawn
Feel just like dying
But what do I know
I'm still here, broken and alone with my fears
