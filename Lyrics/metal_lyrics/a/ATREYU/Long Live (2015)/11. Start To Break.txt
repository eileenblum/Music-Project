Hunted by mindless beasts
Haunted by my desire
To create and destroy
To defy with a smile
Everyday is stick and move
Either way theyâre after you
Mediocre their soulless lives
They live for nothing
They have no pride
Theyâre always after me
Pleading eyes &amp; vacant arms
Theyâre always draining me
Needy souls, empty hearts
Canât pull the wool over my eyes
I can still see

[Chorus:]
I'm so tired but I won't stop moving
Fearful, my humanity is running away
Iâm not foolish I won't stop dreaming
I know that I can be better than I am today
The pressure builds and I'm starting to break
I'm so tired but I won't stop moving
Fearful, my humanity is running away

Away, far from here
From all the cowards and fear
Far away, from here
From all the cowards and fear
The push beyond ones self
To live in the unknown
Canât pull the wool over my eyes
I can still see
You canât blind me

[Chorus:]
I'm so tired but I won't stop moving
Fearful, my humanity is running away
Iâm not foolish I won't stop dreaming
I know that I can be better than I am today
The pressure builds and I'm starting to break
I'm so tired but I won't stop moving
Fearful, my humanity is running away

GO!

If you've never been tested
Then you'll never see
What lives inside of you
Is worth more than anything

[Solo]

And at that moment
When I doubt myself
I pick my feet up
And I hit the ground

[Chorus:]
I'm so tired but I won't stop moving
Fearful, my humanity is running away
Iâm not foolish I won't stop dreaming
I know that I can be better than I am today
The pressure builds and I'm starting to break
I'm so tired but I won't stop moving
Fearful, my humanity is running away
...AWAY
...RUNNING AWAY
