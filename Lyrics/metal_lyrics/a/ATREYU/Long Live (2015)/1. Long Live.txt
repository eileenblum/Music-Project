Go!

We say this means forever
Can't cut the chord and walk away
No special ceremonies
Seeking their approval, no not today
Weâre not gonna hear it
You're full of shit
Our desires burning brightly
Weâre still hungry getting after it

A symbol of promise and of light
When we were wandering lost in the dark
Somehow we'll make it through the pain
(Rise back up when we fall down, we'll fight)
Our bond is forever lasting
(Forever lasting)

Smash, move
Go stamp your feet
To the sound of our eclectic heartbeats
Dance, push
Rage, feel the heat
Kill the background music

A symbol of promise and of light
When we were wandering lost in the dark
Somehow we'll make it through the pain
(Rise back up when we fall down, we'll fight)
Our bond is forever lasting

The past is the past
What has been done is set to stone
The future is all we have
We are the ones who set the tone
And if I should fall
The ground won't touch me at all
We're up in arms
Side by side
Linked in our souls

Our bond is forever
Our bond is forever

A symbol of promise and of light
When we were wandering lost in the dark
Somehow we'll make it through the pain
(Rise back up when we fall down, we'll fight)
Our bond is forever lasting

Our bond is forever lasting
Our bond is forever lasting
