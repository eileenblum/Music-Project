He bends and he breaks
If he gives they will take away
His passion, his pain, his grace

He exhales,
A thousand black flowers explode
Into butterflies as they're away

[Chorus:]
Rip them out, take them,
Burn to coals as they crush and leave nothing
That resembles a soul of a man
See him numb, see him crushed (see him numb, see him crushed)
Rip them out, take them
Burn to coals as they crush and leave nothing
That resembles a soul of a man
Leave them numb, leave them crushed (leave them numb, leave them crushed)

Took the fire inside
One too many times
He's burning over and out now,
He flails
Up against the raging tides,
No more fights
Everything you ever wanted to see,
See it in his eyes
One more time, one more time

Climb down to test the waters,
My hands feel like they're rusting away, yeah, yeah, yeah,
So I'll pace around like a lamb before the slaughter
I'll stay here as long as you let me,
Decision's been made obvious so I will return
Where I started I'll stay here
When I'm finished I'll whither away

[Chorus]
