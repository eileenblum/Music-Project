[B-Side track]
[Underworld Soundtrack]

Hold your breath quiet now don't say a word
You could run (but) it won't do any good
Prayers forsaken when you lose faith inside
It's not time to die

Your life
Is it a lie
When you get what you're looking for
Your craves subside
Or will you crawl into
A casket
An early tomb
Lay down and give up inside
She'd rather die

When you fall
So spent from emotion
She is what
Brings you to your feet
Where challenges lie
On the verge of destruction
She pulls you back
And she gives you wings
(Death won't hold you as tight as she will)

Can you feel her
Running through your veins?
She will always live forever
(Can you bear the burden?)

Can you feel her
Running through your veins?
She will always live forever
(Can you bear the burden?)

You'll turn your back, you'll patronize
She's pleading
You will question your every want
She's bleeding out
She's bleeding out
She's bleeding out

Death won't hold you as tight as she will

Can you feel her blood run through your veins?
She will always live forever
(Can you bear the burden?)
Can you feel her burning through your veins?
She will always live forever

[Guitar Solo]

She's bleeding out
She's bleeding out
She's bleeding out

[Heart beat gradually slows]

Death won't hold you as tight as she will

Can you feel her running through your veins?
She will always live forever
(Can you bear the burden?)
Can you feel her running through your veins?
She will always live forever
(Can you bear the burden?)

Can you feel her running through your veins?
She will always live forever
(Can you bear the burden?)
Can you feel her running through your veins?
She will always live forever
