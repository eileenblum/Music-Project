Coward, the next time you want to fuck me over, stab me in the front.
Can I still see my future in your eyes?
I cannot picture myself, stone dead in your embrace,
And your cruel, crimson smile, kills me quietly.

No one can have their moments free from your withering touch
Fuck off, like your the only one who has ever cried or been broken by love.
Spare me your pity party, drunk off your own misfortunes.
Wallowing in your blissful melancholy.

Can you taste my blood?
You knew that this would kill me,
But you carried on and on, with your selfish shit.
Everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you,
Instead your greed, compelled you, to steal other silver linings?

Burnt down my world, you killed my home.
Spread out the ash and walked away.
How could you just, close off your eyes?
Turn tail and run, you are the greatest coward.

Damn right, I am still pissed.
Next time I see your face we'll see who has the upper hand.
Kiss my fist, taste the floor, tired of your games. Fuck off, goodbye.
