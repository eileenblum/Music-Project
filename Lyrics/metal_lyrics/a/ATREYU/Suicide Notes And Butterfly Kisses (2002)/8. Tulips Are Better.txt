Crystal clear I see the rose is frail
The thorns hide easily in its beauty
As I go to grasp it in my hand
My heart is torn beating from my chest
Let me be captivated
By your beauty
Then let me fall from your grace
Unto my broken knees
Close my eyes so tightly
The tears are welling up
You aren't worth the waste
Of the salt or the water

Watch the sun play in your hair
and I couldn't really care
care any less about you
Watch the sun play in your hair
I couldn't really care
care any less about you

Fuck all your false beauty
It was transparent just like your smile - liar
Your thorns caress my flesh
Crimson drops on a snowy field - liar
I have watched you retrogress
I have watched what you've become - liar
Please take your eyes off of me
It's funny how fast blue eyes fade gray - liar

Let me be captivated by your beauty
Then let me fall from your grace
Unto my broken knees
Close my eyes so tightly
The tears are welling up
You aren't worth the waste
Of the salt or the fucking water

And you are deceit

Just wither away real beauty is forever
Just wither away real beauty is forever
Just wither away real beauty is forever
Just wither away real beauty is forever
