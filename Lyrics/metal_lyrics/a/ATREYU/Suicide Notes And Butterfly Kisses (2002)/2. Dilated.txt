Yesterday I forgot to breathe for like the 6th time this week.
Maybe it was the pink cloud strafed sky that changed my mind and brought me back
Seems like every day it's kill or be killed...
With all this anger there is no time to inhale and progress
And catch the smell of something that you once knew.
Have you ever stopped raised your face up to the sun and screamed
Let it out exhale the pain
That strangulates your soul, when will I be free
My lungs take in the fragrance of remorse, what is the cost, am I living,
If you let your lungs fill up with pain then you will drown in your own regret.
My arms feel so numb my heart palpitates missing a beat.
The blood freezing in my veins. the taste of rust in my mouth.
So today I just threw it all away
Though the light burns my eyes I will not be blind,
If you blink you could miss so much. please don't ever close your eyes
