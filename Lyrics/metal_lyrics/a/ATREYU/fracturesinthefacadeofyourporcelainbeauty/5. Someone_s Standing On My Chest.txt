Starving searching this barren wasteland
Trying to grasp being this alone
Pleading for a breath of fresh air, someone's standing on my chest
Dying I'm asphyxiating myself
I kill myself
Break myself slave to my weakness choke on my words
Oh I'm drowning and I feel so alone
The lights are on and I wish I was home
My lips are screaming pretty nothings
My ears are bleeding for want of words, fuck words I need actions
Hope as left me fucking shattered
Someone's standing on my chest
Alone would be a pleasant change from here
How do you gauge loneliness?
Have you ever felt so alone?
It feels like the light will never reach me here
I am choking back my longing for shed tears
So strangulated by my lonesome fears
Please don't worry too much, it only hurts when I breathe
It only hurts when I breathe (when I breathe)
This only hurts every time I breathe.
