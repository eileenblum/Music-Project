I live
I stalk
I hunt
I eat
With indifference for all
I walk
I kill
I sleep
I breed
Slowly taking control
The sickest part of our species
Ravenous to evolve
We spread like a fucking disease
No vaccine protocol

And at the end of days
This will be our legacy

[Chorus:]
We
Kill, kill
Multiply
Until the skies are black
And the rivers dry
Take, take
Take our time
We leave no one else behind
Kill, kill
And deny
Until the skies are black
And the rivers dry
Take, take
We take our time
We leave nothing else behind

I don't
Feel anything
At all
As rats gnaw at my bones
I'm not
Made of the
Same things at all
A mechanical heart
The sickest part of our species
Ravenous to evolve
We spread like a fucking disease
No vaccine protocol

And at the end of days
This will be our legacy

[Chorus]

You cannot stop what never ends [2x]
You cannot stop what never ends [2x]

And at the end of days
This will be our legacy

[Chorus]
