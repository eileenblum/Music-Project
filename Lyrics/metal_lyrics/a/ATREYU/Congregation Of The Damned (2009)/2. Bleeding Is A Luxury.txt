Ive talked the talk, I've walked the walk,
It's taken ten fucking years,
For them to see I don't need their approval.
I've paid the piper,
I've stayed my course,
Lived chomping at the bit.
With only blood, sweat, and tears to adhere to-

[Chorus:]
Open your eyes and see,
That it's so menacing,
You need to realize that bleeding is a luxury.
Give 'til there's nothing left,
Value in every breath,
You need to realize that bleeding is a luxury.

Take it for granted,
Forsake the costs,
Wear a big, shit-eating grin
(with only blood, sweat, and tears to adhere to)
Now bear the burden to chase your fate
Grind your teeth 'til it fucking hurts
So they can see I don't need their approval.

[Chorus]

Seize the day,
Take your beatings,
Lead the way,
Or decay as you fall down...
You fall down.

[Chorus]

It's a luxury,
Bleeding is a luxury!
