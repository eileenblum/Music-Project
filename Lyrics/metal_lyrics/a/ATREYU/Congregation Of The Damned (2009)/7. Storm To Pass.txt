Razor wire
Gift wraps the things we've done
Afterthoughts
Of past storms weathered before

Oh, no! Oh, no!
I watch the clouds roll in
Oh, no! Oh, no!
It's happening again

[Chorus:]
I'll be watching, waiting
Dreadful, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lighting strike our sins away?
Watching
Waiting
Falling
Shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is the future looking grey?

Aftermath
Much worse then it was before
Battle scars
Some are seen and some are not

Oh, no! Oh, no!
I watch the clouds roll in
Oh, no! Oh, no!
It's happening again

[Chorus]

You can't hide from thunder
And I never thought
We'd turn out this way, yeah!
You can't hide from thunder

[Solos]

Watching, waiting
Dreadful, shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Will lighting strike our sins away?
Watching, Waiting
Falling, Shaking
Will the storm pass over us today?
Or is the future looking grey?

Hey!
Hey!
