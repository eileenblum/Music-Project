[Bonus track]

Look up!
I can't !
To find whats killing you
Dig in!
Stand on!
Embrace what's inside you
Prepare for war and,
The battle is easy!
So simple and so true!

So much war!
This smoking buries us deeply!
Regret our days, when it's time to shine!
It's fucking time!

[Chorus:]
Roaming the night
Stalking our prey
We will take our time
We are the living dead!
Does this despite?
Forming the hatred into the night
We are the living dead!

Watch out!
Prepare!
To defend your dreams, stay true
Face down!
No guilt!
Don't dream, or we'll find you!

Will you fight back
And keep whats rightfully yours!?
Time to fight what's blocking you!

So much war!
This smoking buries us deeply!
Regret our days, when it's time to shine!
And now it's time!

[Chorus x2]

How far will our vengeance take us?
To our own demise...
How far will our vengeance take us?

Bloodlust!
Bloodlust!
Bloodlust!
Bloodlust!

[Chorus]

We are the living dead!
