[Bonus track]

Torture myself!
Yet I've never seemed so brave!
Remind myself!
What it takes to keep us safe!
And love forces!
Conspiring to, destroy you and me!
And my sacrifice is that aren't me!

[Chorus:]
My heart is broken, ripped open.
I can't shield my eyes from the truth.
My heart was broken, stitched shut again.
By those who beat for me and you.

Deny yourself!
The huge cause of this marching!
Engorge yourself!
And decide our casualties!
And love forces!
Conspiring to, destroy you and me!
And my sacrifice is that are me!

[Chorus]

Beautify,
The images from my mind!
But the memory stays behind!
Cut our eyes!
That no more in my life!
The memory comes back to life!

[Chorus]

For me and you!
For me and you...
For me and you!
For me and you!
