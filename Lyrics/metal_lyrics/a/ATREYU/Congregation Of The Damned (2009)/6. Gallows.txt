This life starts
with a heartbeat,
is it beat, beat, beat, beat, beating, me down,
like the loser I am?

I can't help
but to see
that success scares
the living shit out of me,
like the loser I am.

Everytime I walk away;
Every word I never say.

[Chorus:]
Restless
Chasing shadows
Choices
Facing gallows pole.
Are you hanging by a thread,
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars
Are you afraid of who you are?

Are you afraid of who you are!?

Denial what subtle burn,
Is it burn, burn, burn, burn, burning me out,
Or feeding the flames?

Spread out the ash
Pretend to see
That you can
Still find some value in me;
Or is it feeding the flames?

Everytime I walk away;
Every word I never say.

[Chorus]

Oh my god,
What am I afraid of
Success or not having what it takes?

Oh my god,
I afraid of me
And everything that brings.

[Chorus]

Afraid of who you are?
Are you afraid of who you are!?!?
