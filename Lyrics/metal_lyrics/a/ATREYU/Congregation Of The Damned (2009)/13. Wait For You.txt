It started with a kiss and turned out something else.
The blood coursing through my veins I think of no one else
I never believed in much but I believe in this.
I'm incomplete without you, I'd kill to taste your kiss.

I'm lost and lonely,
Scared and hiding.
Blind without you.

[Chorus:]
When the the world comes crashing down and the skies begin to fall,
I'll wait for you
When the days grow old and long and my skins turns into stone,
I'll wait for you
When the pain it seems too much and my heart starts beating out of touch I don't need a thing,
I'll wait for you

It's all so different now, emotions burn me out.
I have a lifeless touch, this distance leaves no doubt.
I fear it all too much but part of me believes.
As the years pass away you made me recognize,

I'm lost and lonely,
Scared and hiding.
Blind without you.

[Chorus]

Yeah...
'cause I'll wait for you...

When the the world comes crashing down and the skies begin to fall,
I'll wait for you
When the days grow old and long and my skins turns into stone,
I'll wait for you
When the pain it seems too much and my heart starts beating out of touch I don't need a thing.
I know I don't need a thing.
I'll wait for you.
