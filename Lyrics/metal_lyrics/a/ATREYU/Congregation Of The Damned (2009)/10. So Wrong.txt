Used to be, I could make the pieces fit
Break the edges, force fit all of this
How could I ever be so wrong?
At our base, we are doomed once we begin
Kinda makes you wonder, "What's the sense?"
How could I ever be so wrong?

And I know that
Fate keeps loathing

[Chorus:]
I can't help (but go back to it)
A flame still burns (at the back of it)
And although (there is a lack of it)
I wont forget how...

Simply put, what's done is dead and gone
Can't forget, not for very long
There is no pride involved in love.
You can't manufacture happiness
Try forever, you would be remissed
There is no pride involved in love,
No pride involved.

And all that I know is that
I know nothing

[Chorus]

You made me feel alive
But nothing lasts forever
Yet something deep inside
It takes me home again

[Chorus]

You made me feel alive
But nothing lasts forever
Yet something deep inside
It takes me home again

And all that I know is that
I know nothing
All that I know is
I know nothing
