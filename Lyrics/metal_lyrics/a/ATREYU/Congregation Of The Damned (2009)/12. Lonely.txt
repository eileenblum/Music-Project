To unafraid of what's to come
I hit the ground and run
Not sure what's coming next
And never looking back

Hollow nights to empty days
Something had to change
Before it gets too late and there's no turning back

One by one we fit and then we fall
One by one we fit and then we fall

[Chorus:]
Lonely, is this what we've become?
So lonely, fragile and unloved
Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun
So lonely, is this what we've become?

Line them up they fall
Something to live for
Not sure who's coming next
But never looking back

I want something more
Something to live for
Before it gets too late and there's no turning back

One by one we fit and then we fall
One by one we fit and then we fall

[Chorus]

One by one we fit and then we fall
One by one we fit and then we fall

[Chorus x2]
