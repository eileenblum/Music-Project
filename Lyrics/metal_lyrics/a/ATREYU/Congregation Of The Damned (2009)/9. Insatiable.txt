Can't check myself at all
Break my fist on the fucking wall
Because raw instinct is all I know
And it suits me just fine

Convince myself that my
Actions aren't received as spite
Then passionately is how I'll go
And it suits me just fine

When I have everything I want
Will I be good enough?
But I can't have everything
Cause nothing's good enough
I'm insatiable
And I hunt down my dreams
It's the only thing I know

Suddenly anger cripples
Colours red everything around me
Sometimes we hurt the ones that we love
And it kills me inside
Then I will pay a price, you see?
The cost is overbearing
The price I pay could be undreamed of
And it fills me inside

When I have everything I want
Will I be good enough?
But I can't have everything
Cause nothing's good enough
I'm insatiable
And I hunt down my dreams
It's the only thing I know
I'm insatiable
Don't look down on me
I can bear this burden alone
This constant dart craving
Ripping apart my soul

Cause nothing's good enough
I'm insatiable
And I hunt down my dreams
It's the only thing I know
I'm insatiable
Don't look down on me
I can bear this burden alone
This constant dart craving
Ripping apart my soul
I'm insatiable
