[Bonus song]

Alone! Empty, and searching again
I don't see any other way...
The brave! Hollow, and brake again
I don't feel anything but pain...

I dream of numbness
To ease the pain
I beg for sleep
To take.. to take me away!

Another night
Another empty avenue
Is waiting for you
And calling me
Another night
Another empty boulevard
Is waiting for you
And calling me

Desperate, clear
Quiet thin air
I feel that this is all in vain...
Beating for change
Empty, Cold, Stir

I dream of numbness
To ease the pain
I beg for sleep
To take, to take me away

Another night
Another empty avenue
Is waiting for you
And calling me
Another night
Another empty boulevard
Is waiting for you
And calling me

Lift, More
Lift, More, Bear
Lift, More, Bear, Sleep
To keep me up at night

[Whispering:]
I dream of numbness...
To ease the pain...
I beg for sleep...
Take me away...

Another night
Another empty avenue
Is waiting for you
And calling me
Another night
Another empty boulevard
Is waiting for you
And calling me

Calling me
It's calling me
Calling me
It's calling me
