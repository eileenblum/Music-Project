Don't give a shit about it
Curl up, I start to doubt this
Something has died in me today (smell the decay)
I need some air around me
Claw walls until my nails bleed
Don't seal my coffin shut today

Coffin nails
So hard to pull
How can I break free?!

[Chorus:]
From the ties that hold you down (break free)
From the grips of loneliness (break free)
There's something missing in my life that I'm running after (break free)
Never meant to be hold down (break free)
All I need is home right now (break free)
There's something missing in my life that I'm running after.

Self doubt breaks down my resolve
It cripples a part of my soul
And masterfully I'll hide my pain (smell the decay)
Dead eyes and a hollow smile
Pitch black, my vision is gone
And masterfully I'll hide my pain.

Coffin nails
So hard to pull
How can I break free?!

[Chorus]

These coffin nails
Are keeping me from the only thing I love
This monster is holding me
How will I break free?

From the ties that hold you down (break free)
From the grips of loneliness (break free)
There's something missing in my life that I'm running after (break free)
Never meant to be hold down (break free)
All I need is home right now (break free)
There's something missing in my life that I'm running after.
