There is no light in sight
Only a tunnel of pain
Only your legs will carry you
Carry you to the end!

Live your life for yourself
Or live for the struggle at best

Just don't let it strangle you
Just don't let it strangle you!

And after all this
No one will carry you home

And without a thought
You let your guard fall to the ground
Thought you were the king
But now it's gone

Taste the air as you pull it in your lungs
Try to savior it for one more song

The thick of the battle
A metaphor for this life
You never see it hit you
Until it smashes you in the face!

You try as best as you can
And I knock you down again

Just don't let it strangle you
Just don't let it strangle you!

And after all this
No one will carry you home

And without a thought
You let your guard fall to the ground
Thought you were the king

But now it's gone
Taste the air as you pull it in your lungs
Try to savior it for one more song

Get up!
Get up now
Get up right now!
I scream to myself

Get up!
Get up now
Get up right now!
I scream at myself

And after all this
No one will carry you home

And without a thought
You let your guard fall to the ground
Thought you were the king

But now it's gone
Taste the air as you pull it in your lungs
Try to savior it for one more song
