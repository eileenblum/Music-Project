Strength comes from within, not from above [x3]

You do not giveth
Therefore you cannot taketh away
No being is my master
I am not a spiritual slave

Heavenly father
Rightous son
Holy Ghost
Fiction

In my brethren love and freinds
I need no divinity on which to urge my soul

Strength comes from within, not from above [x2]
