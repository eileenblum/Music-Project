Every thought catalyst reaction
Nerve synapse, mentally slavery
Disembodied, controlled minds
Sharpened tools, bloddy knives
Electric chips, machines controlled
Boy to your masters, your minds not yours

Dead-end eyes, stainless heart, digital mind
Your bodys not yours
Your minds not yours
Your thoughts not yours
Your wills not yours

Elastic manipulated, mass produce
Pre-consumer, post refuse
Encrypted placed, within activated
Run your course, psychological malfunction
We all break down, we all stop

As the line between machinery and humanity blurs
