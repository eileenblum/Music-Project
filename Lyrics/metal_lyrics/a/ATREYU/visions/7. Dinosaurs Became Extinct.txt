You had anger pulsed rage
Unexplored pathways; limitless boundaries
A voice above the dim screaming so loud
And now you are the masses

You used to run so fast
Where were you going? (NO WHERE!)
I've seen the path you took; it leads in circles (COUNTER PRODUCTIVE!)
Exhausted by your slavery, you are broken (NOTHING NEW!)
Preach words you no longer believe in, your time is gone
Stale

Words are empty as your heart
Your lies breed hatred and contempt
In your grasping, we won't help as you're consumed into nothing

Your lies defeat your purpose
Your purpose is only lies
