Sometimes things turnout the wrong way
You gotta stay strong, you gotta move on
The hardest lessons are teh ones that keep you stunned and speechless

I fell the pain
I feel the hurt
I fell depression
I live in my strength

Remember that your best friend is the strength in your heart
The fire in your soul
And the love in your eyes

Though its been said many times before
By smarter people with larger minds than mine
Love in your heart
Love in your heart will conquer all.
