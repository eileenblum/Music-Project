After all that has transpired
After all thats taken place
After all the stab wounds
And just just before my death
I rise pheonix, like anew
From the still burning ashes of false hearts lies
To fly once again, to shine from within

Dismember my myself
Severe my viens
Poisen myself
A heartless joke
Slash at my neck
Gouge out my eyes
Screaming in agony
You pacify me.

Bleeding hearts shed no tears

Soaked all the way through with remorse and regret
Fire to purify my soul and blood to replenish it
I search in hopes of completion to justify my love for you
Nothing ever ends where our souls begin

Nothing can save me from myself
You keep me safe
Resurrecting my love
An angel like you
Can never fall
Heaven I found
Right in my arms

I found love in you
I find truth in you
I see light in you
And it horrifies me.
