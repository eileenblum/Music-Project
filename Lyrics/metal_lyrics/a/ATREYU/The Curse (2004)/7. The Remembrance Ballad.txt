These days are closing in
The end has become apparent
We're only here for so long
Will anyone remember my name
When time has washed away the dust of our ashes
When my head rests in a velvet lined casket
What's out there?
What is my eternal fate?
And it only just recently hit me
That this life is just a state
Mortality fading, like the innocence of love
I'm scared to death of what's to become

Of my immortal soul of this eternal flame
Will you remember?
Will your heart sing with pain?
Who calls out my name?
And tell me what happens
When my eyes close for the last time
Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness
And what of my soul, what of my soul?

All those things that you couldn't say
You should've said
All those I-love-you's lost
Weighed more like lead on your chest

All those things that you couldn't say
You should've said
All those I-love-you's lost
Weighed more like lead on your chest, what of

Of my immortal soul of this eternal flame
Will you remember?
Will your heart sing with pain?
Who calls out my name?
And tell me what happens
When my eyes close for the last time
Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness
And what of my soul, what of my soul?

[Guitar solo]

If I could take back all those misspent days
Every second of anger, I would wash my sins away!

Who calls out my name?
And tell me what happens
When my eyes close for the last time
Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness
And what of my soul, what of my soul?

[Repeat previous stanza]
