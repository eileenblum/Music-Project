I feel eyelashes on my cheek
And they lacerate my flesh
No pain so good
So put your hand in mine

Never let go
Never wake up 'cause I'm done with promises
I'm taking blood oaths
Feels likes you could kiss my imperfections
My imperfections away
And I would stand
Stand by your side until the sun turns the sky
All the colors I see in your eyes

I'll never need to see the sun again
There's enough light in your eyes to light up our little world
So take me, take my away
Kill me slowly, I'll never be the same

I swear to you, on everything I am
And I dedicate to you all that I have
And I promise you that I will stand right by your side
Forever and always until the day I die

The bite marks on my neck never felt so good
I'm losing control and it's all that I can do
Not to blackout and fall into lust with you
Your kisses infect me
The dark gift is loving you

And I'll never need to see the sun again
There's enough light in your eyes to light up our little world
So take me, take me away
Kill me slowly, I'll never be the same

And I feel immortal and I want to make you feel the same
So stand by me as we immolate
We can burn in each other's arms [x2]
