[Bon Jovi cover]

[Limited edition bonus track]

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darlin' you give love, a bad name

Fuck you

An angel's smile is what you sell
Promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
Passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa!
You're a loaded gun
Yeah, whoa...
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
My damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your games
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

You paint that smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Whoa!
You're a loaded gun
Whoa...
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your games
You give love a bad name
You give love...

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your games
You give love a bad name

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your games
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name
