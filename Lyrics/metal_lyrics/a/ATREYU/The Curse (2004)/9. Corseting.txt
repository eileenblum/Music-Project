Just swallow the pill and think of me no longer
Just let go and take yourself out
Before I kill you too
Aren't you tired of me fucking you over and over?
You were the last person I wanted in my sights
And my heart honestly breaks when I think of you
I understand now what I-love-you means -
It's doing the right thing no matter of the consequence

I'm tying you up, using the nicest lace
Trying to kill you softly, trying to erase your face

All the while I'm doing my best
Not to rub my love against your head
I'd redecorate the walls with your inner thoughts
But I'm afraid it's the wrong shade of red
But I have these sadistic urges
And I don't want to take it out on you

Right now you're the only one who understands my plight
Right now you're the only reason
I can't sleep through the night
