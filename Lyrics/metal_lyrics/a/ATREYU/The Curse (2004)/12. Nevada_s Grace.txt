In this perfection I lament her beauty
Her voice a sour note in this bitter serenade
In this perfection I lament her beauty
Her voice a sour note in this bitter serenade

And all these words I could have would have should have said
Ring out like gunshots across long lost days
If that wasn't love then what the fuck was I thinking?
I would bear my soul just to bask in your grace
And your beauty, your strength inspires all of my days
I would carry any load just to bear your cross for a day

In this perfection I lament her beauty
Her voice a sour note in this bitter serenade
In this perfection I lament her beauty
Her voice a sour note in this bitter serenade

Your love fills me up when the blood in my body's drained
And your strength is my backbone when I feel every bone break

I'm built for pain I swore to let no one in and there you where a vision a beauty

It takes my breath away you took my breath away
And it takes my breath away how you took my
Breath away [2x]

How could I know that you would take my breath away? And
How could I know one kiss would change everything?

Your love fills me up when the blood in my body's drained
And your strength is my backbone when I feel every bone break
Your love fills me up when the blood in my body's drained
And your strength is my backbone when I feel every bone break
