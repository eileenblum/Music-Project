Every stitch represents a soul
A son. A daughter. Someone you know

Freedom has a price
The high road
A steep toll
Party lines they don't mean shit
when youâre in the desert
when your life's at risk

Rich kids don't go to war
Only the disposable masses
Rich kids don't go to war
We do! We do!

[Chorus 2x:]
So others may live
Ask yourself what have you done
to deserve their respect
You've never been on the wrong

side of a gun

Politicians or terrorists?
Killing the youth and robbing the sick
running this nation into the ground
no IED kills like the house and senate

Rich kids don't go to war

Only the disposable masses

Rich kids don't go to war
We do! We do!

[Chorus 2x]

For the warriors that we have lost
for the ones that weâre yet to lose

For the warriors that we have lost
for the ones that weâre yet to lose

We stand with honor and salute the

ones who fight for me and you
For the warriors that we have lost
for the ones that were yet to lose

Every stitch represents a soul
A son. A daughter. Someone you know

[Chorus 2x]
