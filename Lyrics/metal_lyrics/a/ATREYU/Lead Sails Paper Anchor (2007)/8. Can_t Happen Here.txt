[Verse 1]
Chariots clashed in the dead of night
Subversiveness clouds the clearest of minds
Blink of an eye we're collateralized
Raised up in arms never knowing why

[Pre-Chorus:]
We get what we take when we take nothing
Pull the helmet from your eyes
We're erased and betrayed by mistakes

[Chorus:]
Does your god know my god?
This is how the world will end.

[Verse 2]
And it begs the questions
When bullets cloud the sky
Taking away the pain of
Thinking for ourselves
Demons beat down
They beat down our doors
And it begs the question
Could this scene be real
Stealing away our children
Taking away our dreams!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
