(I'm so tired)

All riled up, I can taste the winter.
I would shut up, if I thought that it mattered.

That's what it feels like,
when you're stitched into the skin.
I feel stuck, and no one thinks something's missing.
(Something's missing)

No one cares, no one listens,
screaming words that you fake hearin'.
No one cares, no one listens anymore
(No one listens anymore)

My eyes burn as I bury how I'm feelin'
close my eyes it's my life that I've been stealing
if it's all right, why do I feel a sense of longing
I had it all, and yet I thought that something's missin'
something's missing

No one cares, no one listens
screaming words that you fake hearin'
no one cares
no one listens anymore

[Chorus x2]

So paranoid I've been hiding from the sun
I'm tired of being afraid of everything and everyone
Oh, so tired

No one cares, no one listens
screaming words that you fake hearin'
no one cares
no one listens anymore

[Chorus x3]
