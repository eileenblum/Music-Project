You're always looking back,
runnin' from the past.
You're always sweating me about the next big heart attack.
You're lookin' over your shoulder starin' down the path.
(I'm fallin' down)
Fallin' down
Fallin' down

It's in your head all the voices mistaken,
shake it off shake it off.
We're all dyin' in the end.

[Chorus x2]

I terrorize me images so horrible,
so horrible
To clear my thoughts I drill a hole into my skull
clean up my brains and sweep them underneath the rug
I need them more than I needed any other drug
I'm fallin' down
fallin' down
fallin' down

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
shake it off shake it off
we're all dyin' in the end.

[Chorus x2]

Hey, hey, hey
Come on

I'm fallin' down
fallin' down
fallin' down

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
shake it off shake it off
we're all dyin' in the end

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
shake it off shake it off
we're all dyin' in the end
