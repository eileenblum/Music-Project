Marching alone, like a good soldier does
I'm setting sail, with anchors holding me down
Pack up my bags, stow them away
I'm bidding farewell to all that is safe

Will I come up for air, come up for air
After awhile the current is calling me
Lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh God can you save me now?
Sinking my heart turns to stone

Withering away, a shrinking violet dies
So full of life, these lights they'll guide me out
Into the sea, I needed a drink
I never thought this would consume me whole

Will I come up for air, come up for air
After awhile the current is calling me
Lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh God can you save me now?
Sinking my heart turns to stone
(I turn to stone)
Sinking my heart turns to stone
Save me, take me home
Over and over again
Save me, take me home
Wishing that this all would end
Save me, take me home
Over and over again
Save me, take me home
Wishing that this all would end

After awhile the current is calling me
Lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh God can you save me now?
Sinking my heart turns to stone
After awhile the current is calling me
Lulling me, waving goodbye
I'm out here alone, oh God can you save me now?
Sinking my heart turns to stone
Sinking my heart turns to stone

Save me take me home
When I come up for air
Save me take me home
When I come up for air
Save me take me home
Over and over again
Save me take me home

Wishing that all this would end
