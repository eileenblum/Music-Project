What do you feel in the blackness of night.
The coat of darkness covers your damned soul.
Fire - ready to fight.
Burning fields - moonlight.
Torchures - sparkling swords.
Black eyes - set the fire.
Smell in the air, ancient rites.
For the old gods, sacrifice your life.
Bloody ground, screaming bodies.
Under the sign of the sword.
Possessed - kill the christian rabble.
Fog will go down.
Riding to the gate of pagan kingdom.
With the strength of the dragon, noble people - pride warriors.
The realm where the moon rises.
Thy lord will lead you.
