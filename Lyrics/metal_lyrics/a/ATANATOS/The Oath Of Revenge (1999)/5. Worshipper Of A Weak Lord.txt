I bring you life, I bring you death.
Moments of happyness, years of awful tortures.
You are a devote slave, chained.

Pain is a true feeling, it is the answer of mistakes you made.
You worship him, you cry.
Never he will come back to you.
Lost creature, dust in the wind.

Listen to the voice of the deadlyabyss.
Your thoughts circle around and your views are full of fear.
It is the taste of your own blood.
Wet is it, wet and warm.

I bring you life, I bring you death.
Moments of happyness, years of awful tortures.
You are devote slave, chained.
