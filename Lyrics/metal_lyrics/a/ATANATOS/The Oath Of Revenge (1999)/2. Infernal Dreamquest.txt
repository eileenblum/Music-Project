Cries in the night, apparations in your mind.
Flight through your dreams full of hate and fear.
Victim in an endless war.
On the esca. pe from the real truth.
Your eyes are full of fear,
your cries die away in the wind.
When the night comes and the light goes down
and the darkness rises you will die.
Pain in your dreams, tortures in your life.
Run away, helpless through the night.
When the night comes and the light goes down
and the darkness rises you will die.
Victim in an endless war.
On the escape from the real truth.
Your eyes are full of fear, your cries die away in the wind
