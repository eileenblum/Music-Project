The church is a whore of revelation
Gins and vices rule in it
Church don't spring from Jesus but from malefactores
The pope is the leader of all malevolence.

Your adversaries say: "god didn't create the world
Jesus didn't suffer for the mankind
The ecclasiastical services are useless
Your sacraments are senseless.

The whore of revelation

How many noble people, scientists and servants
Exposed to danger, suppressed from you
Deprived of their joy of life
Torchured, strangled and hanged is unknown.

Everyone who is in doubt about you
Everyone who not follows you
Frighten you and is an enemy in your eyes
That's why you invent cruel punishments and laws.

You set brothers at variance
You want to dictate what is the right way
And your crusades, your fucking crusades
Were marches of general offences.

The whore of revelation.
