Do you hear the cries those tear the silence of night
Cries of forgotten souls, signed by a painful life.

In search for the real truth, the ancient spirits show the way
Dark shadows - eternity, black coldness - frozen air.

Between the dreams, the dreams of damnation
Chained by fear, splattered by torchures.

The dreams of damnation
Chained by fear, splattered by torchures.

Flight for a long, long time
Through protecting blackness of night
The inner fight - revenge
The saving fight so far away.

The dreams of...

Flight for...

Pictures of destructed life
Miracles of existence
Chaos rules - burning fields
Tears of sorrow - hate.

Journey through the spiritual past into the
loneliness
To the ancient kingdoms, return of the damned souls.
