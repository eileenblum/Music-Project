They say it's in everyone's best interest to protect ourselves from unknown threats. We are facing the blackest picture. Drawn to set fear in the ones who not yet have fallen into submission. The definition of freedom is changing as times goes by. The content of the word is dying in the age of repression. Are we going to settle with not making our own choices because those in power and control want what's best for their empires? They will reap what they sow. The can no longer cradle the masses into a false sense of trust. They are running out of time, even these empires will fall.
