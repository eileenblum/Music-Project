We're searching this cold world for humanity and warmth. Giving everything for a place to call home. Don't want to end up jaded. Don't want to be that easily played out. Don't want to keep repeating. We need to find a way to keep our young hearts beating. We're searching this soulless place for a piece of ourselves. Giving all we've got for a purpose and a reason. We're fighting teeth and claws for some sort of solid answers but it seems to me we turn to their lies instead of our hearts.
