Face the damage. The nigts of mindnumbing escapism won't solve a thing. There's a cheap price that you sell your freedom for, it's killing your soul. Giving in to the pressure and letting go of your goals, it's killing your soul. Face the damage. You are consumed and controlled, under the influence of alcohol. For how long will you pay them to keep you down? Now let the seasons change for brighter days and drag yourself out of hell. Not one more day under control. Let us shine, let us grow. Far above.
