In the world we face today, can a soul ever find rest? Right before my eyes I've seen so much I care for die. This will be my last try to heal and redeem from the past. We're climbing this mountain, trying to reach the sky, together you and I. We are climbing this mountain to conquer every fear in life and leave our doubts behind. Through endless days and nights we have all been questioning the motives to believe in anything. Now here I stand engulfed by hope and dreams. To find meaning is the reason why we're climbing this mountain, trying to reach the sky, together you and I. We're climbing this mountain, to conquer every fear in life and leave our doubts behind for hope.
