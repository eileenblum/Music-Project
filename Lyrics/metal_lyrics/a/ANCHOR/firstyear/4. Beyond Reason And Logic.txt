We were young and we were misled to walk a deadend street, hand in hand with guilt and fear. Deceived to believe that we need help from above to pull ourselves through. There's no paradise known as heaven. Just the hell on earth we're feeding. We were fed and we were filled, like we were all empty inside. Like there was nothing there for us to find. There's no paradise known as heaven. Just the hell on earth we're feeding. Shall we fall to our knees and accept our tragedies? Pray for help and relief? While we sit down and bleed. Abandon the lie that cripples you and me!
