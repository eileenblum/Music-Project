Born of silence and sentenced to the same. Dying to find answers but this feeling's got no name. Trapped in-between the fear of death and the pain of living and we'll get nothing in return for the blood, the sweat, the life we're giving. This quiet dance goes on and on. Violence is ingrained. Can we truly live in peace if silence is maintained? Every word unspoken will lead us to the gallows and we ask for nothing more.
