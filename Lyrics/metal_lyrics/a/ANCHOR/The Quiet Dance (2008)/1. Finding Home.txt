Fear, the occupier of mind. Can we declare our own independence when this ghost inflicts our freedom? We, a privileged generation in denial of our intellect, in benefit of insecurities. Why are we so afraid to be alive? Every minute counts! Locked inside our weariness, we cover our ears and shut our eyes. See beyond the patterns that keep us confined. This is closure with every demon that ever held me captured from my spirit, my true being, from who I am. Done with the pretending and the escaping. I don't approve anymore; I will challenge them all! Stand up and be counted. We got to break the arms that reach for control.
