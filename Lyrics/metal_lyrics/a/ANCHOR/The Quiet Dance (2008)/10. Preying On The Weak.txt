They play god but you can't play dead. When the first bullets penetrate your body the warcries will follow you down your grave. The young are deceived and the poor are forced. Sacrificed for nothing and forever gone. A flag covered casket for every broken family. A blood covered body to every civilian mother. This fallen world on its knees to crawl before this monster of monsters. The imperialists and thier allies cannot cover the motives for their own conflicts. History shows a picture of broken promises. The puppeteers of war prey on the weak. Pulling the strings to get their way. With our lives we pay.
