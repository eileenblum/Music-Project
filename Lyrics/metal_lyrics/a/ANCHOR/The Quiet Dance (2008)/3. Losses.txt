Until this day I have kept my faith in humanity. Worn out and broken. Always fighting. I believed in hope for the hopeless, that there was a gleam of light for all of us. But life, you proved me wrong. What was it you wanted? You gave me nothing more than constant losses. I wish for love. I search for rest. But it's meaningless. A tormented soul with vengeance in my eyes. I seek redemption from this empty life. Until this day I have kept my faith in humanity. Worn out and broken. Why still fighting? Where is the purpose if nothing changes. Running up and down a dead end street for second chances. Repeating past mistakes while the race is over. I surrender. I walk this earth in fear of never finding peace with my existence.
