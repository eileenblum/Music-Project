We can never subdue our conscience from guilt by ignoring the contradictions in our decisions. Just a glimpse of this truth will burn forever in our minds. We ask for everyone to be aware. Open up for a new world where animals are entitled their own lives. To this dream of ours we commit ourselves. For who we are we pledge our resistance, our pledge is veganism. Open up for a new world where animals are entitled their own lives. We have recognized the pattern of this old oppression. We have learned that violence can only survive in silent masses. To this dream of ours we commit ourselves. Open up for a new World where animals are entitled their own lives.
