Close your eyes and you will see this world more clearly. I rather walk among the masses blind then become a victim of our time. Are we beautiful? Are we complete? Can the void inside our souls be filled? No more reliance on what is fiction. I am tired of worshipping an illusion. Life could be so much more than an empty struggle for empty goals. Life could be so much more than a perfect image of nothing at all.
