Why do you keep treating yourself this way? Can't you see the damage it brings? The anger, the violence and self-destruction crumbles lives and houses to ash. Scared of seeing the gruesome reality, you drown yourself in a self-loathing sea. Scared of waking up one day and realizing this marketed misanthropy. We all know that life is rough sometimes but drifting away is only the easy way out. The pain and anxiety that you push aside can only be dealt within a conscious state of mind. The weight and the pressure will make you drown. They're all just burdens that pull you down. No more excuses or hiding in the dark. Be done with living in the artificial and claim life as your own.
