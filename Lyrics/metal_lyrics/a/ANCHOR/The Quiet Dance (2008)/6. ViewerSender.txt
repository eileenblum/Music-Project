Turn it on for a quick escape from reality. Sit down and let your eyes bleed. The images flow til they bury you. A distorted vision of life and death reflects on the screen. Manufactured lies you have turned to believe in. Viewer and sender in total harmony when you don't search for the answers on your own. Shut your mouth and lock your eyes this is a one-way communication dependent on your attention. Manufactured lies you have turned to believe in. Viewer and sender in total harmony, when you don't search for the answers on your own. In this disinformative age, don't lay your faith in the hands of the powerful.
