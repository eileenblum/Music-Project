My dear ally, don't give up on your convictions. Some wars will be fought endlessly but we found hope in the most desperate of times before. Now I know it's hard and that you tried. I know that you gave your everything. Yes, I know it's hard and that you tried, but now it's not the time to back down. The true spirit of the words we speak will be remembered beyond our existence. After all that we've seen and all that we've felt. After all the tears we shed for a world we cannot understand. We swore not to forget.
