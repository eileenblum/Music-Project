Waking up to another day of self-contempt, staring into this deep mirror. I seem to have lost myself. I've disdained this image for so long, I can't bear this cross no more. Trying to break free from this reflection staring back at me. I close my eyes and wish that the pain it causes just would vanish. My youth in oppression from this cynical culture. Fooled and broken down to slave on my knees before this sickness. Give me strength to deny submission. Death to vanity, look what it made me, broke my identity to sell me a new.
