2009, still fighting to speak our minds, staying afloat when the masses are kept down. Trying to make sense of these desperate times. We can still set us free from this cold-hearted world. Pollute our minds, the earth and the sky. Force fed us lies before our jaded eyes. Pollute our minds, the earth and the sky. Destruction till the last breath of life. The powers that be; unjust and obsolete. We know they only have served the bloodthirsty, they've never seen the hungry, never seen the cold. Never cared for those who were hunted from their homes. They pollute our minds, the earth and the sky. Force fed us lies before our jaded eyes. Pollute our minds, the earth and the sky. Destruction till the last breath of life. No love, no humanity. How can there be no love, no humanity? How can there be no love, no humanity? Set us free, set us free! no love! Darkness is closing in, the years of innocence are gone. It's time to put the fist down. To take back what is ours. There will be vengeance for the screams they left ignored.
