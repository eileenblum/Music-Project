Awoken by thunder and thrown to chaos. From a broken past I weather a storm that still lasts. I try to overcome but still those years won't be undone. Caught under the illusion that this was how it always had to be. Now I am sick and tired of thinking life already conquered me. Desperately. Relentlessly. We need to feel OK. I was a young kid with a lot of rage, with nowhere to go and nowhere to feel safe. Have you been there or are you still? A restless mind with too much time to kill. Always on the run from life and its harsh reality. But I feel that I won't be running that much longer. I admit my wrongs, welcome change to finally move on. There is no solace in hating the world and there is no redemption in repeating what's old. I will lay these habits to rest and restore peace and confidence. To love and to live, to feel and to be felt, as a human compassionate and king, living life with open eyes, for a better world for all and future worth fighting for. To not give in to distractions that only will drown the soul, to not give up when life gets too hard. To find my own. I need to find my own. To find my own. I need to... There is no solace in hating the world and there is no redemption in repeating what's old.
