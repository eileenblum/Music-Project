I have seen the best of them fall short on their own convictions. Seeking the truth in the darkest corners of this crooked world. Weakened bodies, polluted minds, broken dreams is all they'll find. Troubled souls. Heavy hearts. All torn apart. Must stand the test of time. Won't let the weight of these violent times pull me down under the surface to view the world from the bottom of a lifeless ocean. Can't run from this fight. Must stand the test of time.
