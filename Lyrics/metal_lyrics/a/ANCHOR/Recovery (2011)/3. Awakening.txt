Born into a life never meant to be lived. Treated beyond our comprehension. Valued only for the profit her body will give. An object to the industry. Never meant to be anything else. A beautiful being, full of life, taken by the butcher's knife. Throat cut and hung by the legs. The line of production never ends. Vicious and torturous practices, all in the name of humanity's arrogance. Mankind, hungry for blood. So much for love. No perspective, no compassion. Who will be their voice?
