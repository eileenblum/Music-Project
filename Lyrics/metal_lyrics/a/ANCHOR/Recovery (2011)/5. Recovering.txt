They say I am an impatient man but I've been waiting my entire life for something to happen. In absence of peace I run but at the end of the day time is running from me. While time is running I'm down on my knees. Falling behind, losing track. Trying to get up, trying to get back. With chaos carved into the soul the world spins out of my control. I need to live, I need to leave every worry in the world. With chaos carved into the soul it doesn't matter where we go. They say I'm an impatient man but I was never given a chance to be anyone else. A life of restlessness. I've stayed awake searching for something to calm this turmoil inside my chest.
