We hide in the shadows. We mourn by the shore. In debt to the dreams we had but let go of. Washed away by the stream that took everything and now nothing remains but the echoes of our tortured cries. When the power we possess we use to sell ourselves then what of the days and opportunities that pass? The trumpets of life have long since silenced and left are the echoes of our tortured cries.
