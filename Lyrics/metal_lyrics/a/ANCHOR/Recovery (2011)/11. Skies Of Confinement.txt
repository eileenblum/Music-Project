Under skies of confinement we have been kept. Shackled by fear of sins that heaven wonât accept but we have pumping blood and we have beating hearts and we are more than dust under the feet of gods. No hellfire. No eternal life. No fear. No god. Weâre born of nothing, to nothing weâll return. Weâre not afraid to live, not afraid to die. I defy a moral standard that makes us amputees. Bowing down in servitude. Crawling on our knees. In the eyes of the obsolete weâre all guilty of crimes we never did commit. No casting stones, we just walk away. This fire needs to burn out. Drop the torch and let it die. We just walk away and watch it die.
