Woke up with a scream. Coming back from eternal sleep with eyes that can see weâre not meant to be slaves. We were born unbound and all the barriers of steel and stone canât keep us down. We slave underneath the crown and kneel by the throne. Silent words are whispered of tyrants overthrown. This wonât become our casket, like it became our lives. Dictated and devoured by our masters. The flames of discontent ignited in our spirits to outlive them all and give us peace. For every dream thatâs crushed. For every system that enslaves us. And all the chains that stain our hands with rust. For every dream thatâs crushed. For every system that enslaves us. All the chains that stain our hands with rust. No love for anyone that climbs up to control us.
