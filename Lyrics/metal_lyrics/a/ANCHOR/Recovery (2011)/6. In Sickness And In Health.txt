We're from a place that no one knows, where fear reigns and shame grows. We're from a place that no one knows, where closed curtains hide stories of war. We're from a place that no one knows, where rest is uncertain and love compromised. We're from a place that no one knows, where promises are words that don't mean a thing. We're from a place that no one knows, where no trust survives and dreams go to die. Where parents betray and children suffer. We had no one, we now have each other.
