It was never a choice between right or wrong. It was a choice between surviving or being pulled down. No matter what I face I have this cutting edge paving the way for better days. This heart still beats. Unbroken. Unchained. This heart still beats. Right here. Undetained. This heart still beats. To the fullest, untamed. This heart still beats. Unrestrained. I found self-confidence through my sobriety. I found a place where I feel safe. A testament against the grain.
