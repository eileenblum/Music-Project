Imprisoned youth. Directionless. We are all being brought down the same. Feel the pressure. Feel the judging eyes. Feel them paralyze. Generation after generation following the same old road while there are better lives to be lived. Visible for those willing to see. Be not misled, be not afraid, be not defined. Be not misled, be not afraid, be not confined. Out of the inferno into the calm. We are not in this alone. Never alone. Forget your dreams, this is the only way. You'll learn with time, that's what they say. The nail that sticks up they'll try to hammer down. It's the way of their world until you're buried in the ground. Oppose the violence, live not in fear. Dwell not in silence, live not in fear.
