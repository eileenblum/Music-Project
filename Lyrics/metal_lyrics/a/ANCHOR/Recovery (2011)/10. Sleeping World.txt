As thousands prosper, billions still starve. I see burned out bodies in a sleeping world. Streams of thoughts have been locked out. No reflections of what weâve become. So powerless, so distant from ourselves. We pave our way to hell with the illusion of a paradise ahead. Weâll kiss that image of salvation goodbye because itâs going to burn us from the inside out. I see the future unfold. A world gone to waste and we allowed it in our name. I see the future unfold. The chain tightens around our necks.
