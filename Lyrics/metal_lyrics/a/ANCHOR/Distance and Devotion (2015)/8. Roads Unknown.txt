Dead end roads, I walked on my own. Searching for things not made of stone. Out of step, out of patience. I tried to make sense of a senseless existence. Defiant dream. Against the stream. I've always been so naÃ¯ve. Desperate to leave. Shackled in chains, but with tricks up my sleeve. No matter what comes my way. Defiant I'll stay until my final day. Roads unknown. I'm paving my own, to be at peace when I rest my bones. Out of step. In resistance. I cherish and loathe with devotion and distance. Bridges I've burned. Bridges I've crushed. Still they've been crossed (in the end) I'm my own friend. True to myself. Still with wounds left to mend. No matter what comes my way. Defiant I'll stay until my final day.
