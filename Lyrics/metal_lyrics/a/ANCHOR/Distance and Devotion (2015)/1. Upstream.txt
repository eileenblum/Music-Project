[feat. Aram Arslanian]I will never stray from my path. I'll raise my voice and speak my mind to separate the truth from lies, and not walk down the trail of decay. Face to face with my enemy. I wont back down. I'll stand my ground. I never had another road to take. I will not walk the trail of decay. I reject. I defy. I'll keep my head up high. I'll live before I die. Two words, live free.
