[feat. Rory Van Grol]â¨Brother, sister. I know you're hurting inside, but mark my words, I tell you now. This is our moment. Brother, sister. I swear to you. I'm reaching out for you tonight. Give me your hand. We'll make it right. Broken bones, broken hopes, is what we've been dealt. â¨Broken hearts, broken dreams. Yet we push on. Brother, sister. We all carry it inside. "We'll take it back. We'll take what's ours." This is our battle cry. Brother, sister. We're always gonna be together. I'm reaching out for you tonight. Give me your hand. We'll make it right. â¨Tonight is ours. Tonight's alive. We'll find reasons to live. We won't do it in vain.â¨Tonight is ours. Tonight's alive. We'll do whatever it takes. We'll live our lives against the grain.
