[feat. Julian Laur De Manos]â¨Walking this earth has taught me a valuable lesson: the ones who come in peace leave dead and buried. Truth is a knife in my back, bleeding me dry. I've been close to giving in. Left with my doubts. It feels like a hammer smashing through my chest. A part of me has died. The rest barely survived. Watching this world come crashing down. Left with the ashes. Left in the dirt. War on my mind all of the time. Hope dies last. War on my mind. Running out of time. Still I stand fast. I will live as I learn. Make the tables turn.
