No comfort in this world and nowhere left to run. On the verge of losing this game and let chaos reign. You were the pulse in my heart, the blood in my veins. The one reason I'm alive, a heroine who will never die. You were the one. You carried me out of the storm. The one who pulled me up when I was down. You were the one. You carried me out of the storm. The one who held me tight through all my darkest nights. Not welcomed in this world. I lost myself. Through years of sacrifice you paved my way. You did whatever it took to keep me safe. You are my everything. A friend always by my side, and I'm always by your side. You pulled me out of the storm. You brought me home.
