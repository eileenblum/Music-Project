When all of the bright lights are finally fading and the world turns to black and grey. All of the sadness and the unbearable weight will turn love into stone, and get the best of me. To hell and back. I've had my dreams crushed. I've learnt the price of trust and the pain of loss. I can't stand the silence nor the sound of your voice. I need distractions, chaos and noise. All the reminders of how life used to be. It burns like a fire and gets the best of me.
