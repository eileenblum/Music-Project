What if I don't want to live the life you do, and what if I don't care for all the things that I could've had? What if I don't view this world the way you do, and what if I can't give because you took everything? You say you have a cure, to fix my broken bones. â¨But you were the one who crushed them. You crushed them. A burning inside. I'm twisting and turning. Face down. I never learn. Further apart, further away. Into oblivion. ItÂ´s dragging us down. Deeper and deeper.
