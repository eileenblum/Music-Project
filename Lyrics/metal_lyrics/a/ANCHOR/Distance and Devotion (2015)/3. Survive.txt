The clock is ticking. I can't turn it around. What's done is done. I'll pay the price when the time comes. I've got nothing to lose. No fear, no doubts. These hungry eyes won't see another wasted day. Survive! Hanging by a thread. Fight for every breath. Hanging by a thread. No second chance. Through thick and thin. Through highs and lows. I've been coming a long way without anywhere to go. I never had a chance. I took it. I stole it with my bare hands, but I will never fall down on my knees.
