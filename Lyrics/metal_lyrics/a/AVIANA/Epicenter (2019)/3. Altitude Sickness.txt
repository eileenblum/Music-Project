I find myself, again with empty hands and an empty heart. It's always there.
Even if I close my eyes, it lives in my mind.

Where do I put my trust when it seems this battle has no end?
If these walls could speak they'd tell me fear isn't real.
One of many sentiments I can't feel.

The path is blocked. By mountains as far as eyes can see.
Take farewell of how it used to be.
Trying to find your place along the climb. Reach the summit above the clouds.

I persist. Knowing I'm breathing but there's no air.
High above burns identity, it breathes without oxygen.

All it takes is to step outside, another page for every step I take.
But it's written in a language that I can't read. That I don't understand.

The path is blocked. By mountains as far as eyes can see.
Take farewell of how it used to be.
Trying to find your place along the climb. Reach the summit above the clouds.

I persist. Knowing I'm breathing but there's no air.
High above burns identity, it breathes without oxygen.

I'll put my trust in myself.
I'll put my trust in myself.
