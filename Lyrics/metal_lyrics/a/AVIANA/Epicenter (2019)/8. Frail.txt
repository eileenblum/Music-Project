Surroundings that withers our sanity. Just smile through your own tragedy.
When everything is how it seems it is what we choose to see that determines what we believe.

Filtered air made our lungs weak. Shame on those who dare to speak.
Constant light made our eyes go blind.
Keep your place in the line. There's nothing out there for you to find.
Keep your place in the line. There's nothing out there for you.

I fall behind, for every day I fall behind. Drained and transparent I step aside.
I can't remember why.

This prison has no walls. A lifetime sentence for us all. Even if I breath, do I live?
It's one for one and none for all.
And I forget why, why pain is worth it in the end. That the horizon is not the end.

A simple life, to be buried in the sand of the hourglass.
Bury me.
I do confess. Confess that I have been blessed.

This prison has no walls. A lifetime sentence for us all. Even if I breath, do I live?
It's one for one and none for all.
And I forget why, why pain is worth it in the end. That the horizon is not the end.

Why pain is worth it in the end.
