Mould with your hands what lies within your heart.
It is what I would have done if mine wasn't torn apart.

Thrown into the lake. I barely make it to land. This moment doesn't exist.
It's already slipped, slipped through our fingers and down the drain with the lessons never learned.

It was a fucking waste. Years of covering the tracks I've made.
It was a waste of time that I'm never getting back.

I'm afraid it's too late, I let the virus spread of a life that I don't want to lead.
Days of plague, nights of pure misery. Worlds burning before bleeding eyes.
Twenty four hours feels like an eternity. I knew all along that I had to make this end.

It's getting hard to see, to see any way out of this. Closure seems so far away. Pressure is closing in on me.
Some find comfort in pain, some seek for the answers in vain.
Words of hope still mean nothing when it's delivered by the living dead.

Mould with your hands what lies within your heart.
It is what I would have done if mine wasn't torn apart.
It is what I would have done if mine wasn't dead and torn apart.

You'll feel it taint your inside and you will choke on fear.
No mercy will ever be shown when you try to utter the words ''Please, one last chance''.

Mould with your hands what lies within your heart. But mine is torn apart.
