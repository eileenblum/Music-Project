Erase the line between dream and reality as gravity redefines.
Erase the line between a defenceless witness or it's vicious counterpart.

The only way out; through the mouth of the beast.
It swallows me whole. Skin and bones.
Another layer of fear. Another layer of this dream.
None of this is real. None of this I can believe.

Thousands of nights blur into one. I know what's to come.
A battle with two defeats, my own worst enemy.

Erase the line between dream and reality as gravity redefines.
These walls were built to keep them out but I'm the one imprisoned.
The sentence without conviction.

Where do I run to?
Out of control, always heading the wrong direction.
Where do I run to, where do I run to?
In a place like this there's no room for affection.

None of this real. None of this I can believe

Thousands of nights blur into one. I know what's to come.
A battle with two defeats, my own worst enemy.

I can not move. I can not scream. I can not breathe but I can see.
I can not move. I can not scream.
I can not breathe but my eyes they still can see; my worst enemy.
But my eyes they still can see; my worst enemy.

I can not move. I can not scream.
I can not move. I can not scream. I cannot breathe but I can see.
