Like the rain.
All these emotions fall from the sky.
Like the rain.
Soaked through with my own failures.
But at least I've tried.

There's no exit even if I want to quit.
Outside of this fucking cell, no one hears me yell.
And even if I fall I will climb up this prison wall.

It's better to think you can fly than to not even try.

Like the rain.
All these emotions fall from the sky.
Like the rain.
Soaked through with my own failures.
But at least I've tried.

Erasing myself from my fucking head.
I can't help that inside I'm feeling dead.
Trying to find a place in my mind so I can hide from the hell that I've put myself inside.
That I've put myself inside.

Someday the sun will set.
So I can't give up yet.
Only time will unveil.
If I'm going to heal.

Like the rain.
All these emotions fall from the sky.
Like the rain.
Soaked through with my own failures.
But at least I've tried.

It's better to think you can fly than to not even try.
