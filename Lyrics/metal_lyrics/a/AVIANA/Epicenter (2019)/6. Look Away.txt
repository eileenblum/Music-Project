Do you think I'd let you watch me fall?
Ever watch me fall.

How many times will it be fine?
When will it be enough?
Words like a double-edged blade but harmless compared to those eyes, that
radiate with pity.
No need to say it out loud.

I've already read your mind.
The tempest will rip through this lands and the flood will wash away this vanity.

All this blame but why should I feel ashamed?
I know how you operate.
I'm always going to be the one that you love to hate.

You've always looked away, away from this, away from me.
Either way I'll find a way to exist.
Not even a lifetime can prepare you.
And you will never understand. I'll be counting the days 'til you are silent.
I'll be counting the days 'til you are silent. I am counting the days until you will be silent.

All this blame but why should I feel ashamed?
I know how you operate.
I'm always going to be the one that you love to hate.

You've always looked away, away from this, away from me.
Either way I'll find a way to exist.
Look at this, look at me. Through your doubt I found a way to exist.

Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. The damage is already done.
Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.

Do you think I'd let you watch me fall?
Ever watch me fall.

I'd rather have my body be numb from this constant fight than being safe from behind a glass wall. With bloody knuckles I will not let you oppress me.
How can you be so dumb to think that you'll watch me fall.
