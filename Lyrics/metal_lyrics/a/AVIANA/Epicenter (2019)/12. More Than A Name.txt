So many thoughts inside my head but I never have much to say.
Time change's everything and there are things that I won't be able to explain.
Asking for help doesn't make you weak even though you yearn for the next leap.

Not unhurt, not afraid.
My brother, live to learn.
Your destination lies ahead.
You're more than just a name.

If there's something that holds you back, don't forget that I'll always have your back.
If you ever feel your goal is too far away, don't forget how you got those scars.
And you will stand tall. And you will stand tall.

You will be thrown out in a world that consumes us.
To be yourself when walking in footsteps of generations will be hard.
To let down the guard and have our flame flicker happens to us all.

If there's something that holds you back, don't forget, don't forget.
If you feel like your goal is too far, don't forget, don't forget to stand tall.

Not unhurt but not afraid.
Your destination lies ahead.
You're more than just a name.
