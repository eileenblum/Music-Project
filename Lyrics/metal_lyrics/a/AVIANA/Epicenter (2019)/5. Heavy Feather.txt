Does anybody know how to find this meaning we're looking for?
Take all my possessions, I don't need them anymore.

With half a map and a broken compass. I carry on.

Give me a voice. I don't know the words to speak.
Give me a choice but I don't know what I need to keep.

Endlessly, I'm losing parts of me.
My reflection is infinite.
I know it's within me, an inspiration to be set free.

Finally I've made it to the other side.
Abandon me and let me stay here forever.

It's out there somewhere, something that defines me.
This meaning we're looking for.

Give me a voice. I don't know the words to speak.
Give me a choice but I don't know what I need to keep.

Endlessly, I'm losing parts of me.
My reflection is infinite.
I know it's within me, an inspiration to be set free.

When the sun goes down I lose a part of me.
Then I let the voices in, I lose a part of me.
I lose a part of me.

Endlessly, I'm losing parts of me.
My reflection is infinite.
I know it's within me, an inspiration to be set free.

This mirror mask has become my skin.
Look at me now and tell me what you see.
My reflection is infinite. A black hole that sucks me in.
