The time has come for a change to take place.
But when the old is replaced, the shadows will be the only thing that will stay the same.
And it follows everywhere. Ups and downs and it's still there.
When the light shines the brightest its grip will tighten.

On thin ice, holding my breath for when it breaks.
Freezing the blood in my veins and the thoughts in my head.

Stop rejecting yourself.
Fly up to heaven just to take a dive into hell.
Stop denying yourself.
Tell me the secret, what's hidden in between heaven and hell.

Different surroundings but I feel the same.
Have I've been here before. I don't know who to trust.
I can't take it. Every second I'm here my roots grow deeper and deeper.

Show me where to lie cause I'm never at home.
I'll show you how to lie, like I've done all along.
Done all along.

Is it cheating if you never knew the rules?
A war masked as a truce.
What has the world put you through for you to become this dull.
A poor man buys his time with what's golden within his mind.

Stop rejecting yourself.
Fly up to heaven just to take a dive into hell.
Stop denying yourself.
Tell me the secret, what's hidden in between heaven and hell
