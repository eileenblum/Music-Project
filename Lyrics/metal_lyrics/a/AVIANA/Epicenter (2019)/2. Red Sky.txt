Death will never take no bribes.
Don't get your back up. You'll never know the beauty that's beyond.
They will steal your throne whilst you're asleep.
Drag you up a mountain and push you off a steep.
Don't get involved.
They will kick you bloody whilst you're already down.
Kick you bloody whilst you're down.

Keep your head under water.
They'll stand aside the shoreline. Watch you drown.
You'll never know the beauty that's beyond.

Life is not measured by the numbers of breaths we take.
We keep on breathing for the moments that make us feel alive.

Death will never take no bribes.

This world is at its end.
Give your blessings to your friends and say goodbye to your fucking god.

Death take no bribes.
Your life moves heaven and earth.

Life is not measured by the numbers of breaths we take.
We keep on breathing for the moments that make us feel alive.

Red sky, red sky at night. The shepherds delight.
Red sky, red sky at night. Take the warning.

Red sky at night. Shepherds delight.
Red sky in the morning. Take the warning.
