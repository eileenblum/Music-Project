I would take the pain, the pain that you feel.
Just so you can see all of this more clearly.
But there's no off-switch.

All this time you suffered instead of living the moments passing by.
All this time, stuck in a place where you have been hidden from the beauty of life.

And I wish I can help you see that you deserve to live a life, so happy and free.

Seek within yourself to find the living colors that was always there, that was always there

I do too feel lost sometimes. Don't let it haunt your mind.
Let go of what holds you down, release the potential that you keep inside.

I will be right by your side.

And I wish I can help you see that you deserve to live a life, so happy and free.

You stood up for me when I was weak. And nothing else can come in between.

Through my eyes you're worth so much more and whenever I'm with you I feel at home.
Happiness is right where you want it to be. Let your inner self fully blossom.
Now you are free.
