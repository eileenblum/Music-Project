I never was nor will I ever be
a savage, a rabid monster hidden in between
of birth and death. As light decay
I walk this earth unknowingly.

Calming fires will reign upon this earth. 
But as for now, all I can do is to claim my place in time.
Seek out the souls that was meant to walk this line.
All I can do is to take my spot in life,
seek out the souls that's haunting my mind.

It's the demons like you that always try to lure me in, 
I won't be fooled again.
You can't drown me, I live in the flames
You can't drown me, my life only depends on one thing.
My soul is all I have left, don't take this away.
You don't deserve me, I knew it all along
so please catch me if you can.
My soul is all I have left.

Calming fires will reign upon this earth. 
But as for now, all I can do is to claim my place in time.
Seek out the souls that was meant to walk this line.
All I can do is to take my spot in life,
Free all the ghosts in my mind.

I never was nor will I ever be
a savage, a rabid monster hidden in between
of birth and death. As light decay
I walk this earth unknowingly.
My soul is all I have left.
