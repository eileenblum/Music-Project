Thousands of years and still nothing has changed
We fool ourselves a millionth time, how weak is your mind?

War and crusades, the children's cries will never fade away.
Try to fill the void of a mother's son with your prayers, 
no symbol can justify these kind of sins.
Salvation's what you seek, show no mercy for the weak.
But his hand, you will not reach 
'Cause you're knee deep in the shit that you preach.

This world is hell in disguise, 
as we fight for nothing your brother dies.
We have loved and we have lost, but you've only lost.
This world is hell in disguise.

Salvation's what you seek, show no mercy for the weak.
Thousands of years and still nothing has changed.
We fool ourselves a millionth time, how weak is your mind?

This world is hell in disguise, 
as we fight for nothing your brother dies.
We have loved and we have lost, but you've only lost.
This world is hell in disguise.
No answer to the questions we have, 
so we take matter in to own bloody hands.
This world is hell in disguise.
We fool ourselves a millionth time, how weak is your mind?
