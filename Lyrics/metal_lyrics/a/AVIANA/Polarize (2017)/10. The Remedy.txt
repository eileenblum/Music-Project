Take a step out of the dark.
Your actions, they light up the night.
Enlighten me, what is this greater cause.
We're on our way.
Your walls will tremble for every step that we take, 
we are coming closer.

You live in a dream, 
tonight's nightmare will be tomorrows reality.
Spread the disease, you are a sickness to this world.
So spread the disease, we are the remedy.

I can hear your screams,
I can hear your cries.
Your life is a nightmare.
With every breath you take
your life slips further away.
With every life you break,
death comes for its lost souls.

Your walls will tremble for every step that we take, 
we are coming closer. Your life is a nightmare
You live in a dream, 
tonight's nightmare will be tomorrows reality.
Spread the disease, you are a sickness to this world.
So spread the disease, we are the remedy.

The remedy, our water for the flames.
The remedy. We're the vaccine, you're the leprosy.
