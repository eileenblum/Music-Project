Burning within, following
the same path that I once walked, 
so please hurt yourself
maybe that's the only way you'll ever learn?
Seeking comfort through others with the same perception,
deception has come to cloak every word that you speak.

If we're so deranged that we hurt ourselves just to 
taste the pain, again and again.
If we're so deranged that we hurt ourselves
just to taste the satisfying pain.
We'll learn from our own self-inflicted mistakes.

I must escape myself.

How does it feel to be free?
I must escape myself, will you wait for me?
The tragic one.

Forsaken, watch the broken fall to their knees.
Reach out a helping hand and they'll slit your wrist.

Afraid that you won't be there by my side.
Bleeding out I won't let go.
