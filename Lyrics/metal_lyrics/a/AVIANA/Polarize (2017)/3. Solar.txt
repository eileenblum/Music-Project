Drifting away as the horizon calls for me
I try to catch the choices that pass by
But how can I still be me when every cell that I am dies?
The air that I breathe was not meant for me
The need to be greater is what leads me
The air that I breathe was not meant for me
The courage to chase the dream is slowly leaving me

Time, it shows no mercy at all
The earth will keep spinning after we're gone
You we're chosen to unite, not divide
We're not a blessing to this world yet we're made to be great as the sun.

We're all protagonists through our own eyes
What if the sun was to stop shining? There is nowhere to hide

Time, it shows no mercy at all 
The earth will keep spinning after we're gone.
You we're chosen to unite, not divide?
We're not a blessing to this world yet we're made to be 
great as the sun, tall as the waves 
but we're fragile and broken as the human race
