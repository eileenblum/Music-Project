We feel sorry for ourselves for killing our home.
Our mother in pain, so ashamed for our souls.
The slaughter in the name of our kind.
Blinded by ignorance, silently breathing through a straw.
Torturing her only heart.
We never made this on purpose even though we saw it coming.
Fire will burn our world, stories of who we are.
Is it life? Is it something we're proud of?

I always dreamed of green salvation,
all I can see is grayness covering our sight.
A blind temptation to live right now and die in time.

A filthy virus, a vast plague.
She'll go down with us, a mistake.
We will gaze upon her glory as we're peeling her skin off.
We are a filthy virus, a vast plague.
Blinded by ignorance.

I always dreamed of green salvation,
all I can see is grayness covering our sight.
A blind temptation to live right now and die in time.
