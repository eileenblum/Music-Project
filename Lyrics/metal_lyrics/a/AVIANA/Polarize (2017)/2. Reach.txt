The silence consumes the echoing screams.
I am drowning a lie in the sea of honesty.
Sinking to the bottom, my world is out of reach.

There is nothing here for me, 
my passion drained the dam 
and my hate burned down the trees.

A man in a phantom maze, the sun will never reach his face.
Composition of flesh and mind, the devious lie.
There is nothing here for me.
Destined to chase my own tail, I never stood a chance.

There is nothing here for me, 
my passion drained the dam 
and my hate burned down the trees.
It eats me away from the inside,
fragments of me is all that is left.

I am condemned
All that's left of me, destined to chase my own tail.
The vultures will soon be fed by the hands of my mistakes.
I put myself in here, it should be me to set me free
I am condemned.

It eats me away from the inside,
fragments of me is all that is left.

I am condemned.
