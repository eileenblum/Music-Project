A calm light wind, floating faithless.
Eyes can't see the reaching for greatness.

Just spit on me you hollow dream eater.
Christ I find myself in a bit of a situation,
a black hole you call life.
How can I settle down for this?
Your long road with nothing but exits.
It's a hypnotizing ambition, a vision 
born for our time / formed in our minds.
I am nothing but a tied slave, trying to break free.
Hypnotizing ambition, a vision
formed in our fucking minds.

Just spit on me you hollow dream eater.
A calm light wind, floating faithless.
Eyes can't see the reaching for greatness.
Seeking suns with sight almost shattered,
I can run as long as it matters.

Forced back by my shadow, blinding my sight.
Painting colorful futures black and white.
Days consumed by nights.

How can I be so insecure that I am giving up my own life, 
to be dragged down by a time-consuming necessary lie?
Every time I struggle blind, my senses fail from fear inside.
You break me down but I don't care, 
so just spit on me you hollow dream eater.

Your long road with nothing but exits.
