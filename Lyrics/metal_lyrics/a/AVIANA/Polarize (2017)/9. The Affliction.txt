At the end of the day, we are the slaves.
All eyes on today.
The only peace we will find is in the grave.
We're not the first, no we won't be the last to deny.
To defile a never ending thirst so we do what we must.
We defile, your biggest mistake was to trust in us.
Another secret untold, behold as consequence becomes the goal.

Infect me, spread the disease. 

What would you do if you we're a king?
Lord of the peasants, the vile beings.
Untrustworthy souls driven by fear.
The only truth that we know (that we'll ever know) 
is the one that we have been told.

Light up the sky, hide their knife in their back again.
Blinded eyes, believe all the promises made.

The only truth that we know (that we'll ever know) 
is the one that we have been told.
