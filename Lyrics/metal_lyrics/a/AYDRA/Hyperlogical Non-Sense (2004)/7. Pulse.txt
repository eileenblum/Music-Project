What's this fucking noise?
I feel it pulse in my brain
I'm waiting for silence
But pulse and pulse again

So scared... So cared...
I'm waiting to go mad
The fear of obsession invades me
I cry!! And wanna die
A day to pay the price of my soul
Oh God, give me the power to..

..Decide what's my way
But this noise pulse again
No time to be myself
And pulse and pulse in my brain
So scared... So tired...
No time for the tied
The season of madness is come
No way to escape

I pray my God " save me if you can"
You have the power to...
Wake up it's a new day
This noise doesn't pulse OK
But I feel it rises in me
And pulse for another day
