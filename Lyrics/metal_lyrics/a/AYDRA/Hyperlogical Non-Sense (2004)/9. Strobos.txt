Rise, fall, rise, fall again
This is the story of my life
I will run burning of desire
Every day i have a nightmare
I see myself fighting against myself

Never be the same rises in me my ancient
Rage, come in my point of view see what
I have to do...

Rise, rise, pain!
No one is evil - like strobos in me
Strobos like this

Everyday i live my normal life but in
A second time - I see my dream and
Now I know I can change!!
I changed my self to live in my head a
New great desire search into your self
Take all your evil

LOVE IS DEEP INSIDE!!
