Ego's erased... Low mental phase
Impulses braked by out lines
Ideas refused.. Mind lies confused
Brain's trapped into stereotypes

Senses start revolt against
Beliefs in mental anarchy
Unless dogmas fall breeding
Unbeliefs muddled path to be

Mirror reflect appearance of a
Strange state of place
Vertigo reveal existence
Of upcoming state of chaos

Disorder domain in action
Falling in a preconceptions
Exhumed inhibitions
Chained mental progression
