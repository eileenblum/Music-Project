Fantasies left alone
Are the fertile mud of my sick
When the thought tarse from
I enter the vortex of desire

I'm out of control
Demon drives my actions
I'm ready for the beast
Perversion invades my mind
Impulse takes form
Start now my.... My second life

Much time is gone and I'm conscious
Of my action awake my body with the
Past no one'll give me secret
It's only for me you are the object
Of my sin, in this house i'm your God!!

Your voice is a noise
I'm inflamed from that
Attend your death in silence
Or die in an eternal pain
