My way is closed with walls created
Of shit and pain they have
Taken my freedom to live a life
Without control

Where's my sanity?
Where's my evil cry?
Where's my... Indise me it lives
All is false
Where's justice? Where is truth?
Here's your evil? All is false

Come in again into the valley of grey
Walls of pain, in my head, falling down
The insane man they are borning us
They control our life never see
Never to be, see your end - your desire

This was my end
Inside the insane man
RISE....!! FALL....!!
This was my way
Inside the insane man
LIES....!! LIES....!!
