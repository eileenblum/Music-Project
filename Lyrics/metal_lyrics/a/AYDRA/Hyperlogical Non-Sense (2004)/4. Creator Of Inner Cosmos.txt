I'm searching a new messanger
I'm the new messanger
Show me the way, the mistery of my
Creation
Show me the way, in my desire, i read
The sign i'm still waiting the
Sign of divinity but i don't
Understand my dream

I'm in a state of mental confusion
Nothing to say, nothing to be
I'm so scared, I'm so scared

It's clear
The ancient eye feels the icon inportance
Who are from an infinite time inside me
The creation talks of an unique God
The creation talks of an unique law
I am the God of all around me and
Inside me

I create life and death
My world will live into terror
There's no good in my heart
