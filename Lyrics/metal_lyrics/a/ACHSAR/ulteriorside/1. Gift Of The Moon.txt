[Lyrics: Asfaloth, Music: Achsar]

[Intro:]
You know all my secrets
You know all my desires
You know all my weakness
You know all my dreams about

[Verse1:]
My life without you is nothing
Alone and sad
Days without your smile is vain
No pain
No more loneliness
Disburden
With you I find my freedom
Uncaged

[Verse2:]
Time runs around unnoticed
Strong embrace
Every kiss is like a dream
Please stay
My body begins shiver
You touch me
And my blood is boiling
Burning

[Verse3:]
In the sky and in the sea
Steel blue
Eyes of you still watching me
Keeping
Stars envy with fading light
Tonight
Your beauty on this ground
My love

[Chorus:]
You are mine gift of the moon
My hearts pounds for you
You are mine gift of the moon
In your arms love is true
You are mine gift of the moon
My life is now full of you
You are mine gift of the moon
I give my last breath to you
