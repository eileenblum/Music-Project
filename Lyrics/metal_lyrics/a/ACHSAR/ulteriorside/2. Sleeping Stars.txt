[Lyrics: Tony, Music: Achsar]

[Verse1:]
I'm sailing far away head to burning wheel
to discover the strange places
I just hear the voice, their lovely cries
so sweet, so be, be mine!
I saw a sleeping star, so far, so high
shine for me, just tonight
Oh sleeping stars, what eternal dream
now I'm raising up to your divinity

[Bridge:]
Oh star, sleeping stars
Oh star, sleeping stars
Oh star, sleeping stars
Oh star, sleeping stars

[Verse2:]
Stars, sleeping stars once will burning down
and leave your soul
Die, die alone, solitude in you
no more sleeping stars

[Chorus:]
My star
Ill cry, Ill cry, cry for you
My star
Ill wait, Ill wait, wait for you
My star
Ill die, Ill die, die for you.
