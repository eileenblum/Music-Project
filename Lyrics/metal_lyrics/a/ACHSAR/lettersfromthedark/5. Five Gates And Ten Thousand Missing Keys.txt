[Verse 1:]
Big gate double grid
and two doors guards it
Instrument of a harmony
Target of thievery
My finger is raring
To sign your thieving
Our fists await
To smash your face
Hide from justice
Hide from rage
Hidden between us
Looks like innocence

[Chorus:]
Five gates and ten thousand missing keys

[Verse 2:]
No gate can keep
Anything
from human lust
for things
Any protection fails
before human snake
before will to steal
anything
How we can trust
To you or you
How we can know
if you speak the truth
