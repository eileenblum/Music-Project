[Verse 1:]
Beautiful sky
Dark isn`t here
It is a lie
You are now leaving my soul
Now is the storm in my head
I donÂ´t understand what youÂ´re sayinÂ´

[Verse 2:]
Now you must die
I donÂ´t believe
It is a lie
You`re changed my flow
Now is the storm in my head
I donÂ´t understand what you said

[Chorus:]
But I
Want to fly
I donÂ´t need
Your another lie.

[Verse 3:]
Deep in my head
The river has stopped
It is a lie
Or a new nightmare
Now is the storm in my head
I donÂ´t understand what you said
