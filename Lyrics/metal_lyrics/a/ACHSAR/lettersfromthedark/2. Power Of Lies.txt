[Verse 1:]
Your poisoned mind
Bind me inside
Your secret words
hide the curse
And in your soul
Something is wrong
Crawling worm
Conquering your corpse

[Chorus:]
Power of lies
inside of us
Power of lies!

[Verse 2:]
Your eyesÂ´re watching all
But avoid my sight
The only thing I feel
The truth of your fear
Look at me now
How far you are
The way back is shut
You can`t break out.
