[Verse 1:]
Your words burning my heart
Killing my soul
DestroyinÂ´ my own world
IÂ´m lost in depths of you
IÂ´m telling my tale to the stars
Stories of sad at the night
There is nothing
Only darkness around me

[Chorus:]
Now I cry a thousand tears
For your sweet lips
Whispering in my mind
I canÂ´t stop this
Now I cry a thousand tears
Forever stars can see
Sadness, pain and madness
Deep in me

[Verse 2:]
You`re showing to me
Your other bad side
But you and I know
what is not right
Look to my eyes
and take my hand
and IÂ´ll show you
my own hell
