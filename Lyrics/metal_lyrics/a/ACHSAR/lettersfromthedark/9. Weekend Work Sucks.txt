[Verse 1:]
Every day in this hall
full of workers like I`m
All those slaves
Under fools commands
When the task is done
they come and say
Eight hours is so few
Come back and work again.

[Chorus:]
DonÂ´t call me
DonÂ´t steal my life
Every work sucks
But weekend so much
Weekend work sucks!!!

[Verse 2:]
We are only numbers
Used for their intentions
Empty words they speak
Moralizing, admission
Our pay is still smaller
But their values growing greater
All right I will stay
If you pay all day
