[Verse 1:]
In one minute all is changed
You open letter from Death itself
And you choose the way from this hell
To another secret free realm

[Verse 2:]
When night conquer all the land
And voice of Death once again
Still loudly speak in tired brain
You take rope and say â farewell

[Chorus:]
The story is complete when you read
Letters from the dark
The ancient mystic scripts known as
Letters from the dark
The creed grows within when you read
Letters from the dark

[Verse 3:]
Now lonely body toss in wind
On the shoulder of a mighty tree
And now question awaits him
Are you now really free?
