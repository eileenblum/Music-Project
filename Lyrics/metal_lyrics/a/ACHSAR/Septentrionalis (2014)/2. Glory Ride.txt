Ride
In the steel
With full force
To the northern region
On
King`s command
Face those damned
Cryptic evil creatures
Ride !

Come to me
Doom awaits
In the frozen north
Soon will consume
All of your known world

Swords
Shields and spears
In the wind
Flag of our kingdom
What
Lurks in dark
It`s our task
Light dawns

In this glory ride
We have hearts full of pride
On our steeds side by side
Where our horses stamp
Tremble all the land
Enemy awaits in the dark
In this glory ride
We have hearts full of pride
On our steeds side by side
Where our horses stamp
Tremble all the land
In this glory ride
