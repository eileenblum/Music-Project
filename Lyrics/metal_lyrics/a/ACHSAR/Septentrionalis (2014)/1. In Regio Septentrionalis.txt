Noble thoughts rule might of will
Mixed with magic and melt by steel
But now after thousand years
Imprisoned horrors break that seal

Days are darker and none know why
Soon the North will blood tears cry
Heroes rise from all race kind
And one without shadow will be their guide

In regio septentrionalis

Dark ! Is everywhere
Fear ! Walk the earth
Chaos ! Born again
Septentrionalis !

War ! Scorch the land
Snow ! Is turning red
Blood ! Of innocents
Septentrionalis !

Draw ! Sword for king
Sworn ! To die or win
Leave ! No retreat
Septentrionalis !
Septentrionalis !
