Part of valor and honour in me
With justice and sacrifice I`m complete

Complete

And lo
After thousands of years
From our history, sword they release
Hidden in the past and denied to the future
But now in their hands again
Ready to fight and win

As legends says about blade â it`s full of rage
Of those long dead â and their screams for revenge
Best of them died not in vain â give them vengeance
As they give to us - our days

Splendour of my blade will rend all evil dark
Forged from will of thousands fallen bravehearts
Gleam of glory arise like in days of past
When my creators march under the sign of light
