Take you
Maim you
Break you
Make you insane

They wouldn`t go away
They wouldn`t let you sleep quiet and safe
They will always be there
Haunting your mind all night and day
â¦all night and day

Show your courage
In every pound of heart
Set your steps strong
On honour`s path

Make the justice
Fill your mind
And prepare yourself
For greatest sacrifice

In dark remembrances, everlasting shame has a new shape
You know, it`s shackled to your fate
Torturing your mind once again and again

They wouldn`t go away
They wouldn`t let you sleep quiet and safe
They will always be there
Haunting your mind all night and day
