We climb on broken stairs, crawling beneath the depths of sunken ruins
Every corner hides horrible faces made from darkness and nightmares
Glyphs and sigils, dim riddles and writings on the walls of lost halls

What kind of malevolence
Can build this tracts into hell
Lost in dungeons of Ungor-Hel
To never see sunlight again

Sculptures of nameless gods watching our steps with their grim stone-cold eyes
Traps and secret doors, passages to unknown of deep obsidian vaults
Torches are fading out, sublime mass of dark, something is here with us

Deep into the heart of dungeon they approach
And Seekers in the dark their steps still watch
With fading light they gaze into the main hall
Where guardian of Ungor-Hel sits on cyclopean throne

[GUARDIAN OF UNGOR-HEL:]
IMPERTINENT MORTALS
YOU DARE TO INTRUDE MY SLUMBER ?!
I SHALL HARVEST YOUR SOULS
UPON YOUR RENDED BODIES
MUAAH !

[SHADOWLESS:]
Draw your swords ! Prepare for battle !

Blades of iron, steel and mithril face now fangs, claws and horns
Beast howl in rage charge to hero`s stance
Death in struggle, hate and anger, berserk raging, blood is raining
Red is armor of death wounded warrior
Rend his scales and tear his entrails out
