We will drink and drown our sorrows
All our fears will be gone till tomorrow
Hell awaits us on our quest
Take this night your last rest

Beer and red wine rule our minds
Young wenches in our arms
We will dance, we will laugh
It can be our last time

Laa la la laa ... !!!

Why this sad long face
My old good friend
We will meet once again
In this life or in hell

Maybe I`ll not return
Maybe I`ll fall
Bring my body on the shield
Tell them all I choose to die then yield
