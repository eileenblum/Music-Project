Only in the recesses of my mind
I can never forget this

Like a cancer that never leaves this body
I'll lose all my hair fighting you

I rebuild &amp; regrow
Yet a piece of you still remains

I spend most of my days
With a smile on my face
But in the depths of sleep
You reveal yourself
In the most viscous of ways

You torment me at night
&amp; leave me silent for days
I wish for this cancerous being
To leave &amp; just go away

Stay away
Just go on your own way

I offered you up
Needed some closure
I'll reconstruct your fucking neck
The writing on your walls is false
So why don't you live it?

I feel the need to spit in your face
So badly
I want to spit in your fucking face

Terrible numbness consumes my mornings
Until I've satisfied the coping
With this mourning

Wash me away &amp; leave me for the wasps
I need to know have you found happiness
Or finally uncovered your cowardice

You are the plague
Your future looks so vague

Are we living? [2x]
Or are we dying?
Are we dying?
Are we the lost? [2x]
Or are we just the forgotten?

This bane &amp; burden
This calamity
This pestilence

We are the cure

You are cancerous
I've had enough of this
You are cancerous
We've had enough of this
