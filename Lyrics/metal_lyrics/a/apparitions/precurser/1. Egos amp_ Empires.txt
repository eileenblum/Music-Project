A world of victors &amp; victims
Building egos &amp; empires
Awash in a sea of flames
You know nothing of your shame

With the face of a coward
You run
At the first sight of flames
[2x]

A world of victors &amp; victims
Building egos &amp; empires
A magnificent race
Of filthy beings

Awash in a sea of flames
Taking the innocent
To place the blame

This is the consequence
of your poor judgment
I will let you know that we are here to say we are breaking the barriers
We are the breath of death
&amp; when we're through there'll be nothing left

A thousand years &amp; counting
&amp; man has yet to change
Will we ever see this change?

Crushed by your own personal demons
That have left you here
You stand abandoned
&amp; with a loss of life

A world of victors &amp; victims
Building egos &amp; empires
A magnificent race
Of filthy beings

In an effort to fill the void
You find you're still fucking nothing

The crushing weight has you held down
&amp; bound by the chains of mortification
You can't stand the truth of knowing
That you're just a caitiff

Cursed by your own personal demons
That have left you here
You stand abandoned
&amp; with a loss of life

A world of victors &amp; victims
Building egos &amp; empires
A magnificent race
Of filthy beings
