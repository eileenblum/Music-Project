Naysayer [2x]
A cloak of envy &amp; disgust

Forever in the depths of faulty &amp; guilt
We are revival
From a place of a cold heart
&amp; jealousy, jelaousy
As you stand on your throne
Your throne of lies
Bow your head in shame

Thoughts controlled &amp; nervous to the bone
I've seen the end of your tunnel
&amp; it's void of light

Into the darkest pits of Hell
You shall roam
As you sit on your own
Bastard throne

Naysayer
Your lack of the integrity
Your lack of validity

Bow your head in shame
This is the end of the line for you
We're through your childish games

Nothing but a naysayer &amp; all the same
Th sun shifts but your shadow remains the same

&amp; it's all the same [2x]
The sun shifts but the shadow remains the same [2x]

You bring the demons out of me
It's time to bury you
&amp; with you the worst in me

The graveyard gates are open
&amp; the dead are dying to get in
Open the gates
Let in the dead

You are the worst
You lack the worth
You've been bred that way since birth
Confidence lies at the heart of this
Never lose confidence
