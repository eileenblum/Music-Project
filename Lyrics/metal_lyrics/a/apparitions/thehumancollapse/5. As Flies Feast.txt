We'll do this without God
We can take this back
For the ones deserving
Come join me now
We'll tear it down

Monetary wealth is where your ego is birthed at
Collapse your pedestal
That explains your worth

Words lost in an unexacting public
Have we truly progressed?

A deterioration of decency
Confused by mass media

Our views &amp; belief systems
Are merely dictated to us

I find nothing but the flaws of man revealing themselves
Every day in myself &amp; those who surround me
Come join me now
We'll take it apart brick by brick
We'll tear it down [2x]

We are the generation of over comers
Coming to take the lives they stole
We are the generation of over comers
We are the world
Stop them

As flies feast on the lack of judgement
By those who seek
Entrenched in wicked thought
Provoking lust &amp; leaves the mind to rot

Judgment lies at the heart of this
Let it burn &amp; sink in
Judgement lies at the heart of this
Let the revolution begin
