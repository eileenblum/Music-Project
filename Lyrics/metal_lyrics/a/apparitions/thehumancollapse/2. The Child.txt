Manipulating the mechanisms of deceit
A fake name for insecurities
You hide so well &amp; better than I do

My bones have ceased to comply with body movement
&amp; I'm staying put
I've exposed this so take it or leave it
Run like you will [2x]

Not comfortable in this skin
Let me burn it away
&amp; rebuild
It will bring harm to the house of the heartless
As I use my heart less
Innocence is absent
I'm ruined but I must rebuild

Cracked skin, dry, &amp; boneless
Maturity lies at the heart of this

So let's put some truth to this
I have to put this to an end
You've used my electronic window
For far too long now to hide behind
We've seen your true colors
A child sown into the womb of the bitterness

Manipulating mechanisms of deceit
A fake name for insecurities
That you hide so well &amp; better than I do

&amp; when the sun sets
I hope we're nowhere to be found
&amp; I hope that I can't see you

I'm with your ghost now
I'm met with familiar smells
Nostalgia has gripped me
I'm with your ghost now
Paralyzed
[2x]
I'm with your ghost
