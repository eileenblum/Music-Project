[feat. Tim Ruins Of Within The Ruins]Raped and burned under fascist skies
Don't regret ripe days
We are so far away
And what's been done and done can't be undone
Why? Are we the artifacts?
Replicating burns, words of the faith to fuck again.
We begin to hide amongst them
Closing in on their plans
Where do they want you? Dead in a box.
Between the dirt, rocks and the worms, and if we must we'll claw our way back.
Taking shelter amongst the hills of the damned. Hiding within walls of negligence.
I'm sick and tired of all the lies.
We will expose you for what you truly are!
As we begin to

Open the sky, let in the light
It reveals you to our eyes.
Poen the sky, let in the light
We're here to warn you [2x]

Burned away under sadist eyes.
Only the dead seem alive
My anxieties are the vultures perched upon my shoulder
Loss is at the heart of this.
Flesh consumed and the seed of a hardworking man abused,
Dragged by your own two feet through the dirt.
You fucking asked for this and you reap what you sow.
You asked for this! and loss is at the heart of this

[Tim]
Dead and gone
Are your moral values
Dead and Gone
The things you hold true
Dead and Gone
Everything that you loved
Dead and Gone
Where are we now?
Dead!
And!
Gone!
