Descending down the wire
The burning tearing at the flesh
The blood as it gathers
The pulse ceases at the chest

The fire brazen, brazen
Scolds our backs &amp; scorches our necks
As birth we seem to fall into numbness

The focus drifting from you
Leaving a dead man's stare
I'm gathering the gifts of gifts of gab
An offering of a mortal &amp; sacred hand

Cast out the sun
Bring in the dark
I'll show you the suffocation
Entering the real unknown
Past the distance of the world below

Behold the purest form
The rapid descent we must ll perform
Is this a revelation?
Surprised at the sight
Before us a realm unknown
Soon to be found home

Prepare to
Settle into numbness
&amp; let in the calm
Settle into numbness
Let in the calm

The end lies at then heart of this
It's the end of the line

Thank the Earth for your birth
But just as all
You'll deny the soil
&amp; thank an empty sky
As my blood boils

Stay in your homes
Stay in your bones
We all still will perform
The most purest form
