There is a pool of waste at our feet.
Wading through infected waters and supplying the leach.
Gutted from the inside out as they begin to feed.
They Get their fill and gluttony proceeds.
We survive!
We survive on the bread crumbs of societies finest.
Ignorant to the brutal and The Infection that surrounds you,
More than just a plague.
My hands are roots digging deeper into this earth to find where you dwell.
A cavity of empty vessels and proof of a vacant well.
Dictation lies at the heart of this.
A monarch of trees birthing beneath our feet bearing rotten fruit.
Breeding narcissism and filth that we trust.
A stone cast around our necks and thrown to the sea.
Forced to silence.
This hallucination,
A lexicon of fornicators polluting this world with the socially inept.
Fundamentally flawed in our moral understanding.
Surrounded by portals that support the sleaze.
I am the one that you will fear, on the surface of the murky waters below.
I am that you will grow to detest and loathe.
More than just a plague.
My hands are roots digging deeper into this earth to find where you dwell.
A cavity of Empty vessels and proof of a vacant well.
Dictation lies at the heart of this.
