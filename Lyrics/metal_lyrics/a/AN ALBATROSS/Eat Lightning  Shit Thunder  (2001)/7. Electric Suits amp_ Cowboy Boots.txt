Baby, baby let it flow child.
It's the tingly, brilliant sensation below now.
The butterflies in our guts make it alright,
(Give 'em) bricks, cocktails &amp; flowers, baby alright.
Baby let it go now, Try and let it go.
Suits on fire yeah, Electric suits!
Cowboy boots!
Baby turn it out now
Baby turn it the fuck off now.
