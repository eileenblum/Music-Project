Today, they buried a good man.
It got me to thinking about all of the worthless shit
The plastic people worry their lives away with.
Man, life isn't mortgages,
Life isn't diamonds, baby (*shine*shine*)
Life's not your sports car or SUV
Life's not traffic
Life's not made of plastic
Life's not made of plastic
