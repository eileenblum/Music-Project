Getting faster-er.
Itâs a fuckinâ crime,
(itâs trite and nice, motherfuckers)
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, I got nothinâ to say!
But Iâll scream bloody murder,
Just like I were five
Present it so safely,
And pray it survives.
Promote it and sell it
With a whole lotta sass,
Hooray, Hooray!
For the upper-middle class.
(Repeat first verse)
Yawn, itâs the old One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight...
