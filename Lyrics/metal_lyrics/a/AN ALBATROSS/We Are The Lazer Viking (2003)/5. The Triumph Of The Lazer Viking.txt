Itâs an exercise,
So euthanize!
For shapely hips and thighs.
Cut the butt,
In a fuckinâ rut
Quell them then,
Hush those saddened sighs!
You win the prize,
Viking glowing eyes.
Yeah, itâs a problem and we all gotta deal with it
So get out marching along!
Iâm the Vikingchild, my power donât disintegrate.
The marching makes you strong!
Eat your vitamins on time.
Tussinned, healthy, and in line.
Pills and stomach chime,
Motherfuckinâ feelinâ fine.
