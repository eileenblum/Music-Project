Look into my eyes,
Câmon and thrust with me,
Letâs get down child.
Weâll scream so loud
We canât even fucking breathe.
Itâs the time.
Loving time.
Fucking time.
Sock it to me right now
Itâs the time.
The writingâs on the wall
Itâs our time,
Love or Fall.
Sock it to me right now
Itâs the time, the writingâs on the wall.
