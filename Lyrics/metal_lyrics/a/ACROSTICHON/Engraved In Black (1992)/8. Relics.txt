Walls covered in bloodstains
Door bolted from the inside
Bedclothes ripped off
Tangled in bloodstained garments
Raw mass of human flesh
Once it was a woman
Cold blooded experiment
Deformed anatomy

Ears and nose had been ripped off the corpse
Pharynx torn
Facial features obliterated
Lower portion of the body
Including the uterus had been cut out
Removed and lacerated

On the table beside the bed
Like two pieces of meat... sickly placed
Those mounds of flesh proved to be the victims breasts

Symmetrically arranged
Her heart and kidneys
Bits of flesh hanging from picture frame nails

Ten weeks came to a climax
Killing number eight
Cruel bestiality
