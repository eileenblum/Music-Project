Haunted with fear
Watch the others die
Experience of fear
Human forms will burn

Dehumanizing beings
Fill the wickerman
Celtic folk tradition
Human forms will burn

I cannot believe
I deserve this fate
Others did it too
Hundreds of them are here

Giant wooden statue
Filled with criminals
Exterior beauty
Hundreds will die tonights

Smell of burning flesh
Entering my brain
Skin turns to black
Blood boils, Death

[REPEAT I]
