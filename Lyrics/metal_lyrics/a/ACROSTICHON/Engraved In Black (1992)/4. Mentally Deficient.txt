I set my foot in my cottage
Eyes attracted by human debris
Floorboards covered in spinal fluids
Oozing liquid putresence
Open the fridge; gory sight
Human remains; total disgust
Mummified body concealed
Rotting corpse beneath

Digging up corpses from remote graves
Deathmasks fill every space on the wall
Walking through the house dressed in human skin
Wearing them for hours for peculiar thrills

Am I the source of these human remains
My mind is blank, eternal haze
I cannot remember the things I've done
Lost remembrance, consiousness gone
