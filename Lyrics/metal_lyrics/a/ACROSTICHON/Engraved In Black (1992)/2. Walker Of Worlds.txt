Walker of worlds
Filled with men
Celtic tradition
Human forms will burn
Grotesque male formed starue
Structured maze of wood
Hundreds die by fire
Human forms will burn

Skin drips off like wax
The stench of burning blood
Their final experience
Cauterized 'till death
Reality is illusion
I have broken through
Soul will survive
To walk the dark path

Giant wooden skeleton
Prison walls in human form
Wickerman
Human forms will burn
Walker of worlds
Exchange of dimension
Going to where's no god
Just darkness and desire

Human forms will burn
