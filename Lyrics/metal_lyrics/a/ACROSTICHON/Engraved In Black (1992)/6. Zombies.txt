Totally controlled
It has filled your mind
Attracted all your feelings
Caught you from behind
Keeps away the thoughts
From your consious life
Removes all the pleasure
Hurts you like a knife

No emotions in your face
Apathetic creature
A zombie (that's what you are)
And you are on your own
Tell me there's a way
For me to take away your pain
Fill me in on the horrors
That haunt your brain

ZOMBIES!!

[REPEAT VERSE I TWO TIMES]
