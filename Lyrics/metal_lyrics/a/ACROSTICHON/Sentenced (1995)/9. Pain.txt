[music &amp; lyrics by Richard]

portraits; all over this wall
murdered morals taking my fall
velvet footsteps caressing the floor
listen carefully; i want to be shure

the pig is laughing; moments of doubt
addicted to hatred; forcing the pain

all these portraits remind me of the
water is burning; forcing away

slip into
the sin of living
has been forgiven
i ask for war
(but) i'm getting more
i don't understand

i suck the barrel
i lick the bullet
it removes my mind
to a faraway place
where there's still space
for my kind
the pig is laughing; moments of doubt
addicted to hatred; forcing the pain

Total time: 45:14
