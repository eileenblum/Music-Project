[music &amp; lyrics by jos]

born out of love
in a world of hatred
no future a birth
death always to close

falling of rain
memories fade away
a new start of life
in decay of death

only way out
is too far away
my entire race
lives his last day

a source of hope
in a world gone mad
peace at last
after millions are dead

back into hell; certain of death
after all the horrors; i've now found peace
i create my own destiny; in my last breath
i'm free at last
