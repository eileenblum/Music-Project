[music: jos, lyrics: michel]

staring blind; there'sonly
darkness
bothered by too many thoughts
thoughts of this scattered
world
filled with only bitterness

the more i try to ease my mind
the more sorrow i feel
the more i try to find the
problem
the less it seems to care

walking through a land of memories
a world that's now irrelevant
tomorow's comming much to close
still i've got no peace of mind

getting angry at myself
because of my self-compassion
as if there are no other problems
than the life of luxury i live

reality is fading away
finally my mind is slipping blanc
already sk's turning grey
arival of another day
