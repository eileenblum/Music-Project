[music: jos, lyrics: corinne]

you are so changed since i met you
vague moments seem to come more
often
why do you use it; throwing your life
away
tearing your friends and family with
you

first on party's, now you can't miss
your daily dose
an egoist or just a stupid bastard
don't you see there's more to live for
you seem to be content, but are you ?

why ? are you thinking only about yourself
how ! can you live like this; you only have yourself
when ! will you realize, when will you realize
victims ! why can't you see

sometimes i wonder why people use drugs
started as a game now there's nothing left for you
it isn't cool; it doesn't solve problems
you just create other ones you don't see

your body and emotions are like a shrinking nut
surrounded by a haze of unreality
creating your own perfect chaos
neverending ignorance
