[music &amp; lyrics by richard]

"i am clean forgotten
as a dead man out of mind
i am become like a broken vessel

for i have heard
the blasphemy of the multitude
ans fear is on every side
while they conspire against me"

drowning in a sea
a sea of twisted shapes
escaping from reality
not knowing how to behave

i find myself in the last fase
prepare for neverending days
beyond consious life
i feel myself die

i left my innosense behind
i heard the distant cries
i know your cause, your task
so please take down that mask
