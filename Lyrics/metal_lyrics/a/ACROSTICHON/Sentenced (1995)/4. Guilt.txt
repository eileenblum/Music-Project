[music &amp; lyrics by jos]

guilt is growing in my head
building on a painful past
distorting all i think and see
my mask is your reality

innosense on it's own
among the tempting forces
i'd so much like to fit in
but i'm a victim of society

[chorus]

our depreciated world
one big chicken house
filled with selfishness
is growing worse
hypnotized, then wide awake
i had to shift the blame to me
then sliding into
a sickening pit of beastial pleasure

performed my fear and fantasy
forgot about reality
acted compulsive, non-intentionally
bear the truth deep in me

[chorus]

unstoppable, on the first impulse
desperate, the only way to forget
immediate, relief, social isolation
bitterness, the price of control

[repeat]

now living with the burden
in my callous brain
reliving this certain crime each day
my punishment is here to stay

[chorus]
