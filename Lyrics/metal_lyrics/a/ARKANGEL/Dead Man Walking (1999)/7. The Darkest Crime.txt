Poison runs through the vein of life.
Time's over, we walk into the land of destruction.

Dead man walking in the eye of the storm,
thinking what went wrong
Perpetrator of the darkest crime,
violation of creation for a destiny held in the hands of desolation.

Is this how it ends, in the flames ?
Destroyed by blindness,
I don't want redemption to be gained through fire.

Dead man walks over the carcass of his life.
