Immersed in a sea of pain,
chained to a lifetime agony.
Existence becomes a throne stuck in the side of the innocents.
Born different,
destined to suffer.

A throne usurped by man
for a kingdom played with tyranny,
malicious, vile, merciless.

Modernity devours the children of earth disgraced.
Before humanity's demented eyes,
driven by sickness civilization indulges in suicidal madness.

Within the walls of Babylon, wickedness is rampant, and snakes crawl under virgin skin.

I seek a moral elevation, to salvage hopes of paradise, no more cupidity but altruism restores harmony.
Under a red sky of dying nature,
laments of the dead praise revolution.
Tears of the victimized, flow into a sea of despair.
