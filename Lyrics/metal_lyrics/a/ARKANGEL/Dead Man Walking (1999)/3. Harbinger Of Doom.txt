I pray for justice to rain upon
the head of the sick and deranged
to clean the dark soul of man in a bath of redeeming water.
Light shall pray for the corrupted seed of humanity
to open the door to salvation.

The sword of love shall reign supreme
to extirp creation from the clutches of the destroyer of life.
Upon the road to inferno, man is the harbinger of doom.
The tooth for mass destruction.
