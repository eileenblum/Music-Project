Fallen angels try in agony admist misery.
I hear the screams, after the burning of the land,
in the sand of destruction we die.

Punishment of the fools.

Mesmerized by gold we indulge in crime.
Creation riffled by insanity withers alse the heat of human avidity.

As tears come to my eyes,
I realize the fate of man is written in black by the hand of man.

We embrace damnation with open arms,
we embrace death with the smile on our face.

Written in black dark is our fate, we plunge right into the end.
Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth.
