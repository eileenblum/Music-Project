I am not tempted by your paradise of lies.
Never will I fester in the bowels of decadence.
Committed to nobility for a higher destiny,
in the embrace of truth belongs my heart and soul.

I walk the path of righteousness.
My quest for justice is enlightened by the blazing sun of harmony.

I refuse to partake into man's craving for luxury.

A desire fueled by the flames of greed.
In this world, nether culture is a legacy of prejudices against non human animals.
