I light a candle on the tomb of the departed,
sacrificed, crucified, on the cross of ignorance.

In this callous world, chased are the weak,
therefore they shall be bled within snow.
Predators running to fulfill a sadistic appetite.
Driven by lust, the fangs of man shred,
strifes to pieces.

I make amend.

Freedom to break enslavement,
to wash the shame away from the face of humanity.
Crucified on the cross of ignorance,
sacrificed on the Altar of greed.

[Spoken:]
I remember the first war
the way the sky burned
the faces of angels destroyed.
I saw a third of Heavens Legion banished
and the creation of Hell.
I stood with my brothers
and watched Lucifer fall.
But now my brothers are not brothers
and we have come here where we're immortal
to steal the dark soul, not yet Lucifers
to serve our cause.
I have always obeyed
but I never thought the war would happen again.
