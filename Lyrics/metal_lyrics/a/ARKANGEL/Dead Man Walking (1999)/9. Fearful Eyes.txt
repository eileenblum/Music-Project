Hidden in the shadows of hypocrisy to endure ten thousand abominations,
fearful eyes stare the killing machine.

Imprisoned behind the white walls,
faces of misery incarnated in the flesh of non human animals.

Fearful eyes stare the killing machine.
Fearful eyes window of a tormented soul.
Anthropocentrism pull the strings of cruelty.

Blood flows from eviscerated bodies to fulfill the need of heartless consumption.

We torture and we enslave for the profit of the master species.

Watch the rise of the new Pandemonium ascending from the depths of inhumanity.
We bare the crown of crime.
