Constant and motionless, 
It's waiting and will be, 
Constant in absolute silence 
Can bring disagreement, 
Lack of measure and disgrace, 
Can spread the time of wrath 
Hanging within infinite space, 
It's waiting and will be, 
Cause no one is looking for it 
The message unknown, 
Unwanted information 
So let it wait frozen, 
The nameless message, 
The endless wait 
Nobody needs it 
So why do you want to know
