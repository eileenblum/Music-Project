There's not much left to see from here 
This place is too far away 
Solitary place 
Not a word is spoken here 
I should have announced it long ago 
I cannot see anyone 
I cannot feel the hours passing 
This place is too far away 
I can't remember how I got here 
I don't know when it was 
This place is too far away to remember anything
