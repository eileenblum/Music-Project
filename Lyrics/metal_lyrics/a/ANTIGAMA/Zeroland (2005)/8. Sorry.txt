I've been bad again 
Sorry 
When I'm pissed with everything I lose control 
And believe me I'd rather be with you 
Where you are now 
You gotta let me apologize that I can't say what I want 
I'm sorry that I'm hiding something that makes me afraid 
I'm sorry that I can't see because I don't look 
I'm sorry but I can't be the one I should 
I'm sorry for letting someone down again and knowing it 
I kept quiet instead of screaming 
But I'm sorry for my yell as it left some wounds 
I'm sorry
