Isaac wasn't a cool guy 
He liked to quarrel and dispute 
This argument doesn't make sense 
I will supply you with the proof 
But this is not all 
There is yet another case 
Newton would explain something 
He'd like to convince us 
You are a crooked equation so go home 
Now we have the methods ourselves 
And ther's nothing to say
