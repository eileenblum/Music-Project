[performed by Antigama]Hidden bent unseen
He who fears
Corroded foul abandoned missed
The thought you hide
Black numb deadly abnormal
Missing the past
Unpredicted
Always negative
Destroying from within
The fear you want to love
As if there was nothing
As if you were weightless
As if you stopped seeking
As if you were not poisoned
