[performed by Antigama]Let's not step back
Let's lapse into the void 
(You) Don't have to speak
All you feel is only yours
See the space as your mother
That dressed you in strength
Listen to yourself you're the father of what you give
The space isn't there
It's all that is not
All you lack to awaken
You are not a piece of meat in a dark flat
Wrapped in plastic
Look but don't find
Maybe we won't have enough strength
The ideas will start to devour themselves
Maybe we'll be drowned out by the crowd
The abyss might be a burrow
For just one breath
For your own flame
