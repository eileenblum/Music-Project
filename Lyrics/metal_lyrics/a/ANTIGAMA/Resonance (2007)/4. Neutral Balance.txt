I sit in front of a wall
I sit in front of a mirror
I sit in front of an abyss
The painting
Fall asleep
I lose my illusions
I am stillness
The headless dream
Without the beginning the middle and end
Meaningless
A less of neutrality
A genius spellbound by silence
Conscience closed in a wardrobe
Free from fallacy an guilt
Tripping
