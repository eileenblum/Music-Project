Before long there will be tomorrow
As that thing has to go
The river will polish the glass with its flow
The blood on the feet will be gone
And when you come to breathe easier with the air
The big wind will blow everywhere
Waves will raise and break
Before long maybe we will stand 
By and by
In just a moment
Maybe anon
