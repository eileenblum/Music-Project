Do you know him
He had lots of friends
Showed up in many places
What was his name
He liked to drink and smoke
Where is he now
No one says a word
They turn their heads away and look down
I searched everywhere
He was a respected dweller and you were seen together there
No justice here
This is harmful
This is vain
And will cost you much
