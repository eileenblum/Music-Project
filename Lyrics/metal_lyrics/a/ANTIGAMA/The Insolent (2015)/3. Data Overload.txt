what lies beneath the grass 
between the roots 
that are drenched 

like meat that's been cut 
that smells of fear 
what lies beneath the grass 
when the sun dies out 

data overload 

the sworms of alien desires 
strangle your might 
desire that poisons 
the want that stuns 

you must buy with blood 
of which you'll be out 
you must buy with blood 
that drips away every while 

data overload
