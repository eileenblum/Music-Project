i am random act 
i am by the way 
scummed by the days 
and stunned by the nights 
unintelligible but irreplaceable 

i am a spark 
i am a shadow 
like the letters 
blurred by the rain 

like a word from 
the language unknown 
i am the storm 
i am the frost 

seeing what will be 
knowing what i won't achieve 
i am defeated before the fight 
seeing what will be 

i am random act 
i am by the way 
scummed by the days 
and stunned by the nights 

i am a spark 
i am the shadow 
like the letters 
blurred by the rain 

unintelligible but irreplaceable
