blinded by hate 
i need help 
blinded by solitude 
sentenced to the void 

blinded by hate 
you need help 
blinded by solitude 
sentenced to the void 

you lie to yourself 
you always have a choice 

blinded by hate 
you need help 
blinded by solitude 
sentenced to the void 

you lie to yourself 
you always have a choice 
you understood nothing 
but enjoyed watching 

you lie to yourself 
you always have a choice
