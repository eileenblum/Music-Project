i play the logic of events 
where i look everything dies 
with no surprise i count down 
seven five 
two, seven 
five one, seven 
five nul 

the restrictions start to crumble 
with no effort no analysis 
i count down and i cant's stop 
thirty o seven, 
thirty o six, 
thirty five 

the numbers become the days 
every day is just a number 
the now has gone and left nothing 
another twenty three 
another click 

welcome in the circle 
in the land of monotony
