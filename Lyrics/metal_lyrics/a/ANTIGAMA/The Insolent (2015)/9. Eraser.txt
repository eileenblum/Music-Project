we've got to learn to forgive 
without humility 
to clean after the burst 
erase what you can 

and when the ideals die down 
all that has been 
all that will be 
what could be a chance 
becomes a trap 
becomes a snare 

you have no chance 

we've got to learn 
to forgive 
without humility 
to clean after the burst 
erase what you can 

the meat starts to think 
rotting pollutes 
the surrounds 
the poison reaches 
the thought 
you have no chance
