there used to be the days 
when standing proud 
you'd seen the aim 
the moments 
no one will take away 
without hesitation 
into every head 

you used to spew the lies 
surprised by the torments 
the others had 

you understood nothing 
but enjoyed watching 
you understood nothing 

why didn't you want 
to feel a thing? 
you sure had a chance 
to do something 

every head 

you used to spew the lies 
surprised by the torments 
the others had 

you understood nothing 
but enjoyed watching 
you understood nothing
