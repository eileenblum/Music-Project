the most demanding enemy 
sneaks in silence 
planning the next blow 
the opponent inside 

the insolent 
my inner enemy 

has been my brother 
a moment ago 
the foe inside 

love to destroy 
destroy to salvage 

the most demanding enemy 
merging with environment 
he stays 
silent so that i need him 

my inner enemy 
the insolent
