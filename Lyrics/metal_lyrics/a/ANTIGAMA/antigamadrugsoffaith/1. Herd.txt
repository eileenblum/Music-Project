I'm in awe again
Someone scared your herd
All the thoughts uneven
Another threat, another time to flee
I'm thoughtless again
And I will forget who I am
Fear turn your head
Fear don't look up
I think it's over
We can graze like we used to
I could have been worse
That could have been me
Fear turn your head
Fear don't look
