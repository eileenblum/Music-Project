Paint it over
Forever bleed
In the hope of grieving
Seraph saves us from this

As it reigns
Inside
Hope crumbling from
The suffer entailed

Beating inside
These walls of justice
In the pursuit of achieving communion

We are
Alone
Inside
Seraph repels this offence
You're mine

We are
Alone
Inside
Fed these fucking lies
Too long
You're mine

[Seraph]
This is your wake up call
Your probably wondering where you are
I'll tell you where you might be
You might be in the room that you die in
Are you gonna watch yourself die today
Or do something about it
Remember in Hell
Only the Devil can help you
But I'll leave you in this room to rot

I've been left alone
Cursed heart set in stone

Nigh the hour
Civilise
Beyond all reason
Seraph slaves us
Dawn his fate
