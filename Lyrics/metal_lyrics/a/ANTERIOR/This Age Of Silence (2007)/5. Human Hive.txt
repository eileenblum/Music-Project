Born alone elixer dawn
Save your pestilence
Lost in fire you ger on your knees
Lashed to your inspired thought
To be

Your throne in divide
In my insolence
Pulling on the straps of hope
Blissful to be ordained

In my
Lie surround
Times astray
Your turn to bite
In this human hive

Valour for democracy
Torn from the bowels of
Hell burns the best win
Reaping of the fearful
