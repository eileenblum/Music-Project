The mute voice of reason
Whispered softly into the
Deaf ears of insanity
A dark cloud
Swallows a midday sky
As I sat here dressed in divinity

Bleed them dry
To who I give this
Unforgivness
For these actions without words
Blood red night
Crucified hope with you
We will burn this

Fight
Led astray
Hope or fall
We will rise
Who am I
Not to know

Calm my thoughts
Calm all my intentions
For what it's not
Spare the night
Claw forth the day
Tainted eyes
Gaze upon destitution
A scent of this new life

Inside your world
We will fly
Into the night
Will I rise up
Unforgiven
In search of life
I'll love

Life
In search of life
I
Won't close my eyes
