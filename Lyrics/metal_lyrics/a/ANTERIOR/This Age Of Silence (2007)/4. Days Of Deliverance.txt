Liberate my life
The hate, the hurt belial
Fates tight hold will ensue
Bury my fucking conscience
In you

In you
Fine line behold

Days of deliverance
They're holding on

Consequence my rival
She lays your heart in fire
And you'll burn the only truth
To seek belief
She stares
As you face the sun
Watch you
Watch you

Burn
No longer
Days of deliverance
The hour
They're holding on
No longer
Days of deliverance
The hour
Fates holding on to you

Stay the sight
In life's red dawn
Confide in me
In me deliverance will
Hide
