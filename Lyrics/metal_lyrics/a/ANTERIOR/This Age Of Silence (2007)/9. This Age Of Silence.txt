Catatonic yet glaring eyes behold
The voice you use
By calling the gods
Get inside this ride
No time for searing
The night we'll walk
So come and bring it

Down
And so it goes
My world
Is falling in line
Find
Screaming eyes
For us all
Brainwash us too

Tear down the wall
Unseeing not untold
These words within
For prying eyes
Life
Of the wise
Will comply

Rise
Calling to rise
You've got nothing to
Lose
Nothing to lose
You've got nothing too

Get inside this ride
This time believing
The night we stalk
So come and bring it
Down
And so it goes
My world
Is falling in line

Rise
Calling to rise
You've got nothing to
Lose
Nothing to lose
You've got nothing to lose

Line by line
Script my life
Eyes tight shut
I'll die for life

Your world
Judged away

Conceal your words inside
For this world's too fake
Too blind
Compare great hurt to innocence
Just to speak in this age
