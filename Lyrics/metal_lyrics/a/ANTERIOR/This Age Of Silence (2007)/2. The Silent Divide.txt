When I tread the verge of Jordan
Lost within the hope of freedom
Not for control
But in light of our cause

Bid my anxious fears
Will subside
With another death, in another

Rise up
This age of silence
A god with a quick fix of

Annihilation
Pulling on
These two words: Apathy, Sacrifice

Awakened soul
Look fourth and see
Ungodliness rip open me
For all I have contempt for greed
Death of deaths
No fears I see

End of days
And Hell's destruction
Land me safe on Canan's side
Grind me down
This fearless soul

Manifest my darkest destiny
Divinicate
For the untold

My heart
Inside
Behold
The Silent Divide

I'll see you at the top
On judgement day
Because a lie burns twice as bright

Breathe
As the light begins to
Fade to exist in my will I
Bleed
Blood of redemption
Save
Broken still I stand alone

Come to pass the hour of Jordan
Liberation now
Within these walls
As they echo control

Above I stand this prospect
No abate
In another death
For another life

Awakened soul
Look fourth and see
Ungodliness rip open me
For all I have contempt for greed
Death of deaths
No fears I see

My heart
Inside
Behold
The Silent Divide
