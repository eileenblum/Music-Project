Born into greed
The wicked snared
In the work of his own hands
Realise their consumed in
Flames of reality
Triggers the bloodline inside
For the faction to belong

Breakout tonight
We are
Taming the town
We hide
Within the night
We are
Taming the town
We hide
Within the night

In I
Will I stand beyond this hill
Alone but
A martyr in me
Lement this myth
Bare the wall
Here to rise
Tonight

Glorify
Nightfall
From above as below
Resolve the bastion of faith

A good seat
In this dynasty
Within
The city of scars
