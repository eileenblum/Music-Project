Crusade
To march with a heart filled with rage
A lust for revenge
Traded for blood
Stare as the life drips from the blade
It seals your demise
How easy the hand fits the throat

Your mind so cold and hollow
Will disgrace and destroy
Yet still claim reprieve
So easily
Your faith blinds you all

You the restless martyr
Now receive
A solemn note from callous hands
These are the words you must obey
Take life for belief
Vile actions echo through time

Now raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot

Lead the guilty to the rope

Unite and raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot

Never forgive, never forge
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
