Burn
The fire will light the path
Trade for the nightfall
The pattern is so predictable
Another reason to dream in the moment
Not be denied
I'm not a product of circumstance 
Or a name in a line

Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down

It's this sheltered life that you're living
Try to recognise
Your choked up words
Are empty still

Fight Blood in the throne room
It's over
These towers fall
Blood in the throne room
It's over
This towers fall

Your lies
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
We're alone

Fear is the change
That brings you down
Blood in the throne room
It's over, it's over
Mirror my lesson learned
Tailored for reason
Laid to rest your lies
