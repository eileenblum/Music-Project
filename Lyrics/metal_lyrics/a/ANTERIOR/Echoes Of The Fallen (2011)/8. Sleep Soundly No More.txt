What sight to witness
This is darkened room shows no escape
Chaotic bleakness
These thoughts that haunt my will
To be free

A cursed fire burns inside
As I embrace the silence
The peace is fuel for the machine
As I feel

Wrath of fate
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are

I'm fighting this solace
I pay my debt with anxious fear
But still I face this
Rising tide of blame

Am I the criminal
Or am I the victim

Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are

Am I the liar
In that I must doubt
Is this still real
Am I the noble one
I set them free
Now set me free

Sleep soundly no more

Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
