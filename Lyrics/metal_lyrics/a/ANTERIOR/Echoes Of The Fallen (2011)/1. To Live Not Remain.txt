OH!

Every day
Set the goals, embrace the illusion
This ain't the way supposed to be
Confessed yourself to death
And wore your scare on every sleeve
This candied maxim stays the same
This pained reprieve

[Chorus]
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain

Bury me
In this suit I wear today
Another wasted dream
A dream that fades away
Staring at these walls
Inside this fucking hourglass
Just stand in line
This lonely mile
Is bleaker still

[Chorus]
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain

It's a long road nowhere
This journeys fate intact

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
