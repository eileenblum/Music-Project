Dark reveals
I sense her luring eyes
And her evil intentions
Without a voice
She calls me into her arms
But I feel a cold embrace
The sweet sting of fear

Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of existence
Take my hands
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave

Alone
I fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets

Towards me she steps 
In silence
Bitter her stare
Can I turn away from this
Our fatal engagement

Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of your life

As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternity

Now take my hand
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave

As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternity
