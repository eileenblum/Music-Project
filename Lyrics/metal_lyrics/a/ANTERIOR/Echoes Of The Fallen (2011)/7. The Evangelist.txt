Lay your dollar down
To pray before me
These words that i'll preach
Are set to stoke the fire
Raise your hands
This gift of hope I give to you
Your faith is my cruel device

[Pre-chorse]
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
For I
The Evangelist

[Chorus]
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Is this the price of belief?

[Breakdown]

Now praise
The souls that give will now be saved
My words are lies laced with disguise

[Pre-chorse]
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
Immortal I stand

[Solo]

[Chorus]
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Be forever lost
You'll never find redemption
no matter what the cost
This is the price of belief
