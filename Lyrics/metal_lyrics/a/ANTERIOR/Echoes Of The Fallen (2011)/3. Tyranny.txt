It bleeds the weak
This shallow empire is built on lives
Lives crushed down as they tried to fight 
This darkened heart will bear no compromise
And with no thought of weakness

Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown

The task is simple
Put more coins in the hand
Now hold your tongue
And lay your loyalty down

Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown

Blue blooded tyrants
The faces of sin
They wear the masks
That smile with "mercies" grin

Black gates protecting
Their fortress of lies
It holds the vial of ink
That scripts our demise

This greed infects
Their blackened hearts are reaping
Gold and green

Amassing as we lose the fight
For now we see an altered shade of real
There's no one left to conquer

You're born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
