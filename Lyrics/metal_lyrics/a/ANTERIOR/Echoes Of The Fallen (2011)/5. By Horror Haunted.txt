You trail the hounds
That chase your dreams away
Hopeless you are
The vultures lie in wait
Graceless road ahead
Your fate is undisguised

Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again

Dare to fail
The rope's around your neck
Obey the call
When it sounds like hope
Crushed by apathy
You'll forever be lost

Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope

Wake from this nightmare

Step from the ruins
That shadow fates embrace
Break from these chains
That shackle
Rise and prevail

Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again

Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
