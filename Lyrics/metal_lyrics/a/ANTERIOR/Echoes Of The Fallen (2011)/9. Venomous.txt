Sit the fuck down little boy
I've seen a million like you
And I wish everyone could see
Cold heart and hollow mind
This story's getting so old and dire
It's rehashed pathetic and weak

Wretched you stand
Desperate you'll fall
You'll struggle in vain

Blind hate so unjust
I'm sick of hearing from you
The lies
Your cruelty without a cause

Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed

Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same

Shameless tainted soul
Your tale will never be told
Denied, archaic, it's echoes are weak

Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed

Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
