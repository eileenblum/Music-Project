[Drittt]

Bathing in unpure desires
You canât control their flow
Crystallized into dead fires
You taste the fears that grow

You are boiling under your skin
And your marble eyes stare at nothing
You are walking addiction within
How long can your bear this suffering?

Come to the dead end entry
The beast inside you is fury
Come to the dead end entry
The beast inside you is fury

Lies, desolation and lust
Thatâs all what they left us

Roaming in a world that is not yours
The plague controls the system
You fadeâ¦ the willâs not enough
Convictions never fed any man

Still youâre boiling deep in your bones
Now your eyes are sealed forever
No more walking, your legs are like stone
How long can your bear this suffering?

Come to the dead end entry
The beast inside you is fury
Come to the dead end entry
The beast inside you is fury

They fucked your pride, they fucked your life
You reached the point of no return

âWork, consume and die â no alternative
The number you were was not productiveâ
