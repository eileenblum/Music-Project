[Drittt]

Crushing all thatâs left in me
Dematerializedâ¦ and incomplete

To burn againâ¦ to free my mindâ¦
To fly unchainedâ¦ nothing else to findâ¦

Like a beast of burden
You carry your load
Like a beast of burden

Iâm free to die or to create
And thereâs no man to control my fate
No need to hide, no need to crawl
My spirit flies above you all

Wonât bleed and kill myself for you again
Wonât bleed and kill myself in vain

You can hit meâ¦ Iâll never feel the pain
You can bury meâ¦ but Iâll rise again

To burn againâ¦ to free my mindâ¦
To fly unchainedâ¦ nothing else to findâ¦

Like a beast of burden
You carry your load
Like a beast of burden

Iâm free to die or to create
And thereâs no man to control my fate
No need to hide, no need to crawl
My spirit flies above you all

Wonât bleed and kill myself for you again
Wonât bleed and kill myself in vain

Noâ¦
