[Drittt]

Weâre all what you hate
Weâre all what you fear
But we are your seed
Your bastards make you bleed

New generation made of sins and scars
Pioneers of a world made of booze and sex
Sinners of the Night where the whores are stars
Getting fucked for pleasure and wearing latex

- Revolution -

Thereâs no pride no shame
Lifeâs a fucking game
Thereâs no hope for us
Cause futureâs made of dust

New generation made of sins and scars
Pioneers of a world made of booze and sex
Sinners of the Night where the whores are stars
Getting fucked for pleasure and wearing latex

- Revolution -

Rats by night, pawns by day, you are nothing

We, the eyes of Dunes
We, who are immune
We, the sons of Lust
We, who never trust

New generation made of sins and scars
Pioneers of a world made of booze and sex
Sinners of the Night where the whores are stars
Getting fucked for pleasure and wearing latex

- Revolution -

Weâre the sinners
Sinners - Fuck
