[Drittt]

Close to your dismay
Fashion-eaten day after day
Viscous, cold like an autumn rain
Youâre only a putrefied brain
- Empty inside -

A worm does not live; eats to exist never sees the Light
Youâre the same: unconscious, living through material
That way you lost contact with yourself, with your soul
You even lost your pride
- Empty inside -

Purple skies, a warning for your lives

No more gods above you
Now you know they lied to you

If only you could delete this worldwide tragedy
A programmed genocide and a total reverse of Humanity
The shit âround you is the result
The common denominator
Human race still in reverse
- Empty inside -

No more gods above you
Now you know they lied to you

There is no way out of hereâ¦ You still mesmerize
The rapture is complete
Caught in Chaos, a society of casts,
That never stopped to be
You fell in the Pandemonium
Caught in the vortex of the time: the Spiral Eternal
