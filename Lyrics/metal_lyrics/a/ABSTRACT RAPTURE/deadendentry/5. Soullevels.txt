[Drittt]

Step by step I got to your core
Without contention without fake
Aside of your new life
You had a disease you couldnât take anymore
But while you were sleeping
A voice was slowly whispering
âSeize the moment, blast your torments your past shall be erasedâ

- Erase -

Dishonour impressed in my bones
No other could resist so long
So many things that were refused to me
So many lives I only dreamed to live

Faithless, burning deep from anger
Inner fracture, broken down

Lifeless, ground and stoned without you
Fix substantial, eyes unsound

To the senseless body driven
Radiant power from spheres below
I soak and breathe the puce of plagues
That infect what you call morality
Entangled in opinions
Encaptured in religions
Formatted, led by dead emotions
Itâs your fate that you erase

- Erase -

Step by stepâ¦
