Since the cut appeared in me
I've been trying to get more higher
I never tried to heal myself
Cause I never had the time. Never had the fucking time

I was dying for things that made me cool
But now they are not worth a shit
I realize I was a fool
In search of a reason to exist

In my brain a song vomiting lies
We remain the sons of a hidden vice
Searching the lock of a door built in secret in my head.
Eternal decline of life, but doc says it's all right

If getting nowhere is a crime
Then I'm a fucking criminal
So many years have passed me by
Cause I never had the time. Never had the fucking time

Nothing concrete realized
No son through whom I could live on
Totally dehumanized
I'll die forsaken
With nothing done

It's not a scream, nor some tears
Than can change a whole life of shit
And in addition to my fears
I still never have the time
And I'll never have the time

If I had another chance I would be a man
With no remorse
But it seems there is no other past
Just booze, and bad friends and mistakes
