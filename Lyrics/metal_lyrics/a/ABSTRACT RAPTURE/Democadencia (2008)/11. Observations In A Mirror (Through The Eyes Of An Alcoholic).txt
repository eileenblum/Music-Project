One more bender last night
Can see it today through
My blurred sight
I feel the booze in me
Diffusing its poison slowly
Pathetic animal life
Wrenched in duality
Two egos, permanent strife
Abandoning reality

Paralyzed.. My body cries -
Hypnotized...
But my soul denies
Paralyzed.. My body dies -
Hypnotized...
By my own lies
True bitches live in the bottle
Fooling me has become their
Struggle
It's always the same refrain
I drink till the last drop
East my brain

I detest the one in the mirror
Am I you, are you me?
I dive back in the bottle,
Deeper
Or maybe out of me?

I hate to see those eyes
And that wilted mouth
That lies
That ripped and dirty skin
The man and the jinn within
Regressing from dry to dry
But keeping on boozing
Meanwhile
If you were to meet me
You'd say:
Life left his body erstwhile
A tree, without a mouth to
Swallow, and without eyes to
See this decay, has got a
Better chance to welcome
The morrow cause his roots
Will never betray

Never sober over the
Past years
Never sober is better:
No more hangovers
There's no future,
No past life to tell

And in the nights to come
I'll booze as well
