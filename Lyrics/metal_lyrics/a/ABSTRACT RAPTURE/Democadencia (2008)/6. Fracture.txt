The tears of blood
That I cried
Flow in my bones
My heart tormented by fears
Turns into stone
I used to crawl at your feet
I was so blind
You fracture will be
Complete
My reign will shine

Gods cannot beat us
Gods cannot defeat us

Like a snake with a new skin
With the same eyes
I'm standing in front of you
To break the lies
The ghost of my dishonour
Will haunt your nights
For all the screams I swallowed
You'll lose your pride

Gods cannot beat us
Gods cannot defeat us

All the pain that I endured
Was the shade in your mirror

I'm drinking at your veins
