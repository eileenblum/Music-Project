Unreal flashlights burning the eye.
A concatenation of absurd scenes.
Wandering shadows of men amidst men
In the shadows. Life and death are a
Curse and there's nothing between.
No more daylight. No more hope.
No more diseases as no more flesh.
No disire. No disdain. No more faith
Cause you left away...
Miles and miles of unknown fields
A sterile life with sterile vields
Thought you could emerge and
Remove this all
See you can only retire in the void

A static world. A frozen sun.
Swarms of pathetic beings on the
Desert road. Unto a crossway
Gathering souls. Coming out from hell,
To a rightless zone...
Walls you built around you
Can't hide the real world, what's true
Miles and miles of unknown fields
A sterile life with sterile vields
Thought you could emerge and
Remove this all
See you can only return in the void
Another me replaced myself and
Another her replaced my love.
Reprogrammation of mankind:
New millennium formatted brain...

Walls you built around you
Can't hide the real world, what's true

Did you really think you could help
This place become sane?
Didn't you know men themselves
Wrote this decay?
Why didn't you tell me I was
Fighting for this vain?
Why didn't you tell us there is
No fucking other way?

Billions of men through the ages
Believed in shit...
Who's gonna save them from
A dantern fate ?
