Moonlight - Driving nowhere fast
A cigarette, I watch the rain

Strange town - But everything
seems strange
Since all desire left my skin

Reject and fight back your
Fears
Reject all the sickness and
Puke your hate

Howling under the light
Is there any life tonight?

Rejections - New wounds
Of my fractured mind
Even the skies seem to abandon me

4:00 A.M. - And those white lights
Making me blind
I'm absorbed in a whirl somewhere
Deep in me

Why can't I see before me

So far away from me
So far away ' Away from you
