Your body's full of nothing
And your brain is full of lies
You may pretend to be a man
But you know inside
There's only putrefaction, gangrene...
You have no soul
I'm waiting for the day you'll puke
Your crap and you'll fall
Life is a fake and a mental disorder
Life is a fake and a constant
Breakdown
Freedom is a whore
And your noxious utopia
Freedom is a whore you can never pay

In flames this world
Will forever drown
Surface decomposed, paralyzed
Ossified, no one seems to care
Cause it's easier to deny the truth
With a line of snow to share
Isolated, mermetic, cynical,
How come your mind became so close?
You ignore my hate...
But inside of me it grows
Life is a fake and a mental disorder
Life is a fake and a constant
Breakdown
Freedom is a whore
And your noxious utopia
Freedom is a whore
You can never pay
On the roads of my life
So many bastards
Tried to kill my mind
And infect my blood
Now I'm walking straight
Towards my fate
With a furious fire in me
That radiates

Inoculate your child
With hate
Teach him the way
To be paranoid
