I wake up screaming your name
Night after night I'm facing my shame

All in me is poisoned love
I can't believe I could go so low
All you preached cannot heal me now
I may bleed, I'll die somehow

You lied, you burned me alive, you fed
Yourself with my pain
You lied, you burned me alive, you fed
Yourself with my pain

How many times we sat down together
Talking to the wind and building our
future?

All in me is poisoned love
I can't believe I could go so low
All you preached cannot heal me now
I may bleed, I'll die somehow

You're the needle in my flesh
You're my wound

There was no hate in our summer nights
Only sweating skins while I took you
By the reins to ride

Killed me slowly
All in me is vengeance raw

Raw
