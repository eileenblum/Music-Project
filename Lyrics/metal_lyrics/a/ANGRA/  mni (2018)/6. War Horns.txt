Trumpets cry warnings from heaven
"The virgin dressed with the sun
With the moon on her feet
On her head a garland of twelve stars
Then, being with a child she cries
for the birth of a King"
[Apocalypse 12:1]

War Horns the sign of the times
Break through the silent cries

Petrified, I'm facing the rapture
Choking on tears, the prophecy fulfills
The angels come announcing the gathering
The wages of sin are for all who live to see

War Horns the sign of the times
Break through the silent cries
Visions from prophets unveiled
All burns in the lake of fire

"Fire will be raining from the sky
The sun will be darkened,
The moon will not give its light
The stars will fall
And the powers of heaven are shaken
That's when the Son of Man
Will arise in the clouds"
[Matthew 24-29]

War Horns the sign of the times
Break through our silent cries
Visions from prophets unveil
All burns in the lake of fire
