[Music: R. Bittencourt, F. Lione, F. Andreoli, B. Valverde, M. Barbosa; lyrics: R. Bittencourt]

Sorry, you're nothing but an illusion
You're just a mind projecting our world
Worries are nothing but conclusions
Worries are lies deterring your rebirth

You are the silent bliss
Behind the abyss of thoughts
Of conscious mind

Sorrow are faces on the mirror
Billions are hearts and names ethereal
You are the quiet dream
That's always been before the seeds of time

Shed all the fears
And trust the universe
Light of transcendence
The real perfection

It's all in your hands
To trust the universe
Light of transcendence
The human conception comes

A brand new world
Conception comes!
