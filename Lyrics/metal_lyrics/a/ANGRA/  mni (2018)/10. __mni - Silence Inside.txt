[Music: R. Bittencourt, F. Andreoli, B. Valverde; lyrics: R. Bittencourt]

You realize, silence inside, free from time and space
Echo the horns and thus we reborn in glory

No surprise, mesmerized, the new flowâ¦

The miracle of love
On the edge of the world
Expands in and out the horizon of ÃMNI's infinity
On the edge of the world
The madness of love
Ashes blown as the sun goes down like dying ember

There goes life unbroken 'n' fragile, around the OMNIverse
The limits of void back the source where we belong

Hold your breath, be quiet, receive
Be sure of nothingness
Certain and calm, beneath the tides, you cross the line

From the bounds, sparkling skies are crimson

The miracle of love
On the edge of the world
Expands in and out the horizon of ÃMNI's infinity
On the edge of the world
The madness of love
Ashes blown as the sun goes down like dying ember
â¦Leaves a silence inside

Neutron stars are now colliding
Bursting somewhere in the sky
Every day we're better on destroying
What love and chaos organize
Can't our God be wrong?

The miracle of love
On the edge of the world
Expands in and out the horizon of ÃMNI's infinity
On the edge of the world
The madness of love
Ashes blown as the sun goes down like dying ember

The miracle of love
The madness of love
Our mirrors collide, the trumpets shall cry as the walls fall down
