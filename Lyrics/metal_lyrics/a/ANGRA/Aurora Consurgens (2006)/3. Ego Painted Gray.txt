[Loureiro / Bittencourt]

I feel the pain but I'm afraid to cry
All the time, desperate hiding tears
My life is boring and I count the days
On and on, woe is here to stay

Only if God would show a sign for me
Ohâ¦ Only if God could hold my begging hands

This endless torture's building up my rage
Holding on, hide my agony
I'm getting weary just to be alive
All I want is help!!!

So, you dove into the dark beyond yourself?
Lost your way to find the surface once again
Insomnia will kill all your solemn nightsâ¦ Oh!
Haunting your despair!!!

Sorrow made your life a living hell
Lights are fading
Caught inside the black-holed inner-self
Ego painted greyâ¦

Insomnia will hold pleasures in a shell
And your defiant stare!!!

Sorrow made your life a living hell
Lights are fading
Caught inside the black-holed inner-self
Ego painted greyâ¦
