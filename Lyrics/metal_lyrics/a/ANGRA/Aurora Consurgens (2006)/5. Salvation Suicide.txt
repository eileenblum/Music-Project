[Loureiro / Bittencourt]

Wishing to be dead when hope is gone
Depreciating life when the days are looking bad

Sick of being alive when everyone is vain
Lost your hopes and now you fight against depression

Cause life's hard for everyone just look all around you
So why squander all your power on self-destruction

Too proud to make amends
Your faith, it all depends â hold on tightâ¦
Too scared to be alive?
Salvation suicide calling me!

A long way to hell

My spoiled paradise has met this dead end
Cause I live my life all on my own with pride

Too proud to make amends
Your faith, it all depends â hold on tightâ¦
Too scared to be alive?
Salvation suicide haunting me!

Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
On my way to hell
