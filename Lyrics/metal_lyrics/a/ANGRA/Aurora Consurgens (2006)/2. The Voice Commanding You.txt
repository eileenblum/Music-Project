[Bittencourt]

War games inside your brain
You got to fight alone
Falling back, your sanity has gone

Why'd you ever think that you could run away from pain?
Sorry man, your tries were all in vain

Wandering 'round like a phantom in the dark
And you're waiting for the night to come
Lunacy attacks and you struggle to hit back
You'll be waiting for the morning sun

I'm the voice commanding you
Divided we're nothing â united we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Someday the madness will loose controlâ¦ over you

Dreaming on, you can fly in a never-ending story
Where the sun will shine every passing day
Free your mind, let your spirit go free into the night
Let the minutes be gone and fly away

Coming in and out the confusions in your mind
Going crazy as the night moves on
Playing with your head now you're wishing to be dead
And you're praying for the dawn to come

I'm the voice commanding you
Divided we're nothing â united we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Don't let the madness assume control
Over you, over you, over you

I'll be there reminding who you are
All the time with no escape
You look inside the voice is calling you
Take your chance it's never late

I'm the voice commanding you
Laying down the law
Divided we're nothing â united we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Can't make me go awayâ¦ I'm over you

I will never surrender

I'm commanding you
Laying down the law over you
A border line
That you can't hide
The voice commanding you
