[Falaschi / Andreoli]

Into my mind
It all came closer again
Things that we say
Sometimes throw the reason away

And I know I've been less than a man
There's a burning inside me since then

I have cried for you
Lost my pride for you
Now that you are gone
I can see the sun
I have lied to you
I have tried to do
What you want me to
What a perfect day to throw it all away

Feelings disguised
Are now coming to new life
So many tears
That have fallen down through your eyes

I am only the shell of a man
There's a burning inside me since then

I have cried for you
Lost my pride for you
Now that you are gone
I can see the sun
I have lied to you
I have tried to do
What you want me to
It's a perfect day to throw it all
A perfect day to throw it all away

Wasted time, nowhere left to go
Peace of mind is what I find today
Breaking ties from this lies you know
Life has no meaning
When you're out with me
So don't let it go, you'll never know
How many days and nights

I have cried for you
Lost my pride for you
Now that you are gone
I can see the sun
I have lied to you
I have tried to do
What you want me to
It's a perfect day to throw it all away
