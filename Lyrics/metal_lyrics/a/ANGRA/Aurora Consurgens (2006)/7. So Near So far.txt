[Loureiro]

Look at my face
Scars won't deny

Alone again
I start to cry

Staring at me
Too blind to see

Open arms
For all I give
For all I take
Inside of your heart
So near so far

I'm just a boyâ¦ like you

Oh! Father I pray
For your charity
Wisdom for life

Was all I needed
Was all I wanted
To share with you

You know my heart
Was not disguise
Waiting for you
So stay with me

I'm now a man! You know!

Come! Take a chance
And give it all
No harmful winds
To whisper for

Life is short, you know
We can regret
Healing wounds always help us to redress
And with you I learned to live

Come! Take a chance
And give it all
No harmful winds
To whisper for

Our time is short, you know
Must we still regret?
Healing wounds always make time to redress
And I love you more each day
