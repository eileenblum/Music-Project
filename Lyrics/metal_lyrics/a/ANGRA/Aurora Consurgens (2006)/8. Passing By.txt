[Andreoli]

Home you go tonight
To break the sound of tears
Life's fading
To keep the world away
Is not enough to ease the pain

Time is passing byâ¦
Time is passing by; I see it in your eyes

Fire burns inside
A light that's caught between
Night and day
Sun's been set to die
The supernova in your mind

Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes (repeat)
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes (repeat)
They tell me all!
You can't deny
It's in your eyes

Visions disappear
Memories of a dream
Surrender
Give them to the wind
Deny your sorrow, live again

Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes (repeat)
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes (repeat)
They tell me all

Time is passing by
I see it in yours eyes (repeat)
Time is passing by
I see it in these eyes
I see it in your eyes

They tell me all!
You can't deny
You know you tell me lies
