Awaken the crystal bells of sorrow
Caught ourselves pretending our frustrations
Were gone
Once again, instead of facing the day
We ran away; closed our eyes
To keep leaning on feelings we had
We were close
Misty memories of a past come by
And I'll write my pray
On your face of hidden secrets
Never shared, freezing soul
Dreams last forever
To the empress of the dark
Lay down on eternity
Your music in the air
Great delight in the symphony
Our dance will never end
The Queen of the night
The master of wisdom
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder
The Queen of the night
The feast of illusion
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder
