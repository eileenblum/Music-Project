There was a point
When I was there
Where I didn't want to be
But I was there
Escaping from a place i've been before
I was myself, I was in me
And from where I see and feel
I saw a man who was afraid
Of who he wished to be

Nighttime is taking longer
My hope will sabe me from despair
Dragging me out of hell

Hold on
The miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down
The minute you find love
You're facing the light

When I think I'm going deep
I'm really going hollow
I can see a newborn me
Emerging from the bottom
The two side of my brain
Engage into a fight
From the right the left is wrong
And for the left, the left is right!

The nightmare is growing stronger
My hope will save me from despair

Hold on
The miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down
The minute you find love
You're facing the light

Angels are calling out my name
I'm so afraid now
How can I know if I am sane o going mad?

Hold on
The miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down
The minute you find love
You're facing the light
You're facing the light
You're facing the light
