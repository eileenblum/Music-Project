Christus rectus

Anima nostro semen
Oh, miserere nobis
Gloria in excelsis

Omnipotens dominus
Primoris Agnus Dei
Christus rectus
Dona nobis pacem

Now my monster is awake
Had no tears for my mistakes
Still I know I have a lot to learn

I can see it through your eyes
All your demons in disguise
I'll protect myself on garden heart

Won't be a fool no more
Won't fall into your trap

You control your evil side
And I do the same with mine
Just a one to lead control of me

Won't fall into your curse
I see you everywhere

Go! Black hearted soul!
Won't you fly all away from tonight?
Find your way through the rainbow of darkness
Go on to light!

Won't you go? Black hearted soul?
You will fly all away from our dream
Find your way through the rainbow of darkness
Go on to light!
