I find myself lost in the Swedish night
Sunset it's crying in the sky
Suddenly I see a new horizon
And I began to wonder why?

New day, sunrise
Sound the trumpets of the dawn
Far away, for a while
I hear the angels Silent Call
Oooh, the Silent Call

All the answers to this dubious mysteries
In the magic midnight sun
I got an old bag full of recent memories
Many laughs and many cries

New day, sunrise
Sound the trumpets of the dawn
Far away, for a while
I hear the angels Silent Call
Oooh, the Silent Call

Oooh,

Spread my wings and fly
Only guided by faith
Through the darkness or light
May have the "whys?"
It's always the same

It's always there

Night and Day

The Silent Call
