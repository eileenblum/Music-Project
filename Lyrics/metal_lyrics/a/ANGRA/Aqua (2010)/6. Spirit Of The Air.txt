Deep in the ocean, mermaids are crying
Oh, Lord
King of thunder, magic surrounds You
Oh, Lord

On the island, land of the elves of the hills
Ariel's wind, blow the sails into a war

Before You can say, "Spirit! Come and go!"
My Lord
I'll bring the tempest, I won't even question
I'll be gone in a trip of a toe

Inside of your rage, now I'm trapped again
Cloven pine was my prison for a decade

[Chorus:]
Groves and standing lakes
Island of dreams where You reside
Spirit of the air
You throw your tricks and spells
And claim for your freedom once denied
It's no good watch the skies through someone else's eyes

I'm a soul of freedom, Lord of the wisdom
A creature of nature, I drag 'em to the ocean

[Repeat chorus]

Through someone else's eyes...
