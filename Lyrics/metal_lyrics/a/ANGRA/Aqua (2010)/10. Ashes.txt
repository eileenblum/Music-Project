Our revels now are ended
We were actors?
We were spirits?
Melted into air
Now I lift my spell

Forgiveness I embrace
Heaven sent hell away
All my life
As a dream
With open eyes
I'll restart

I was blind and deaf
Until the day of wakening came
I had faith in evil
In his palace of no blame
All this world around me
I created on my own
And now it's time
To free this island and be gone

All my life like ashes in my hand
I'll forgive and prosper 'till the end
The magic of stars now filling my heart
Like a blaze

Time, now it's time!
Feels like ashes all my life!
I'll restart

I was blind and deaf
Until the day of wakening came
I had faith in evil
In his palace of no blame
All this world around me
I created on my own
And now it's time
To free this island and be gone

Lie at mercy all my enemies
I'll forgive and leave across the sea
We are such a stuff as dreams are made on
Set me free
I'll carry on! Carry on!
This end is my start
We are such a stuff as dreams are made on
And I'm gone
