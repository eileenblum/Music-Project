I always was a lower being
Not much, I'm just a beast
You might think I'm the lowest of the low
But there is something you should know.

Long before you came
You'd have found me here,
and never begged for your help
This old land will be mine once again

And all my sacrifice will be worth the price
and never again I'll be a monster in your eyes

You took my freedom:
And shaped it into your servant
You taught me your tongue
Denying me the word

Lord o' mine for so long
Now comes the time to regain my land

And Miranda will see
All my sacrifice, will be worth the price
And never again I'll be a monster in her eyes
I'll be a monster in your eyes
I'll be a monster in your eyes

Please, be not afraid
By this isle's sounds in your ears
When I have waked, after a long sleep
The clouds I was dreaming
I cry to dream of again

Lord o' mine for so long
now comes the time to regain my land

And Miranda will see
All my sacrifice, will be worth the price
Forever I'll say
My stolen paradise
Will be worth the price
And no longer I'll be a monster in her eyes
I'll be a monster in her eyes
I'm just a monster in her eyes
