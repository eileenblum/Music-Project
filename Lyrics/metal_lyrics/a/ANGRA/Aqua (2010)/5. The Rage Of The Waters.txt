Rise of the tides, breaking the hush
Far in the distance it's heard
Watery eyes, feelings disturbed
Face the troubled waters
Soaking the earth, kissing the sand
Your feelings seem to overflow
Running in streams, out of control
A wave is on its way

It will collide against your soul
When your fears are all tumbling in disorder
In the ocean of new emotions

[Chorus]
In the rage of the waters
Wild surging, transformations, molding our lives
It's the age of the waters
Stirring up the patterns of our minds
So long, it took me to learn
Surging waves can take all your hope
But when the torment ends, comes the calm
There's no reason to despair, no!

[Repeat chorus]

In the rage of the waters
Where the tides are turning, feelings are running, molding our lives
It's the age of the waters
Boiling the fears we've kept inside, changing the direction of mankind
