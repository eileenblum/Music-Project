Time for your reflection
What's the promise you have made?
Destruction of your pride and reconstruction of my name
You betrayed me where's your bravery?
Now you face your doom
Your fate will be traced by the spear that went tearing through
When you hear the winds of revenge
All of the distance and the chains
You put around my damned soul
Right now it's all finished
I'm just building your new world
While you navigate in peace
And glance at lands you will control
Bewitched you cannot see the route
And hell where you will go

[Bridge:]
When you hear the winds of revenge
You will see the goddess crying
And the boats will sink and now
You play my secret game

[Chorus:]
Arising Thunder!
Welcome to me, you fall alone
Stand up and face me in a fight!
Drowning in tears deep in the storm
Once again, once again!
Go!
Look out!

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]

Once again,
Push!
Once again!
