Enchanted by fierce desire
Souls consumed with haunting fire
An empty guarantee
A stolen freedom

Deceptive illusions rise
Take the chance to mend your pride
Been tortured and humbled
Never again

Lost in a maze of sounds
Clarity escapes
The whispers chase you away
Numb and unaware

Hollow, the world where you belong
Lies you have believed for far too long
Laid low, life has come undone
Nothing stays the same, for time is all you own
All you own

Under a cold dead sky
In the sea you'll learn what you must be
Stretch for hell as you seek revenge
Bear the scars of your inhuman rage

Lost in a maze of sounds
Clarity escapes
The whispers chase you away
Numb and unaware

Hollow, the world where you belong
Lies you have believed for far too long
Laid low, life has come undone
Nothing stays the same
For time is all you own
Empty spirit, hollow soul
