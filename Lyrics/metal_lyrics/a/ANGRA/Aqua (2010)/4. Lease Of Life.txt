Where do you came from?
I hear an angel song
It seems to be a call,
Eros's chant of love
Take me through the storm

When you came from afar
It took so long
Spirit brought me life,
A passion at first sight
Lend thy hand, my heart

Nymphs dance around the isle
A phantom screams and haunt me all the time
Then you come
Like an angel from the skies
Princess of my dreams
I wonder why you are gone
Someday you'll return

Where do you come from?
Faraway? Beyond?
Virgin as a diamond
Precious like a child
Lend thy hand, my heart

We've got to believe we'll join our lives
Over the vengeance, treason and lies
We can be one, we can restart

Forgive my mistakes (time will tell)
Forgive my mistakes, someday
Since I arrive on this shore
I've seen all my past (someday)
A new force come from the source
A new lease of life
