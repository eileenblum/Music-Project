By the shore, on an island
I can hear, our sea of sorrow
With no harm with no disgrace
I am planting the seeds of tomorrow

In my circle I will reign
I was left behind betrayed
Oh yeah!

Dark backward, abyss of time
Right in front of my eyes
Evil nature destroyed my trust
All their scheming will end up as dust

In my circle I will reign
I will rise against my enemies

Now come away to your master
Bring through the air all your magic

I'll bless and curse you till the end
Set your whole self aflame

Foolish visions in my angry dreams
Bringing vengeance to my shore
Now my wisdom shows a different scene
There is not love for us all

All this time my mind was in the past
Furious footprints in this sand
Now living has revealed at last
All the weakness of a man

Turbulent tides
All the waters seem so rough
Keep your faith because the calm will return

I've been longing for this tide to turn
Bringing vengeance to my shore
Time has passed and this is what I've learned
There is not love for us all

All this time my mind was in the past
Angry footprints in this sand
Now living has revealed at last
All the weakness of a man
