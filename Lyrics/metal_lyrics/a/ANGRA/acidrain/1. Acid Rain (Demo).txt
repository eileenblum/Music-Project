When the world had a tragic fate
We were draining the infected sea
Though the scene was indeed too sad
Only prayers were taking lead

Oh! just some of us survived
At least a discent woman and a man
Wide awake! Am I alone in this place?
Someone hear me ? my only hope!

The acid rain is burning right in front your eyes
Again the dreams may loose the glow
Allow the sorrow of your thoughts to meet sunrise
And shall the hopeful words bring love inside your heart
