[Matos]

Simple minded brain,
For now you succumb
Nothing changes your way
This worlds insists to be the same
Based on our mistakes
The flowers fade along the road
Don't blindfold your eyes,
So loneliness becomes the law of a senseless life

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...
Go!

Now you have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay - for how long?
Cold is the wind and thunder struck on a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on!

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past...
