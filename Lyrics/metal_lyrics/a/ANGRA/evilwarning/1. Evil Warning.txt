['94 Version]

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...

Miles away
You're heading for the unknown
and there's no way to get back
Time to complain
Nobody is feeling the truth

To live in the crowd
sick of your own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymms of betrayal
calling you for the attack

Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high,
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time
to cry and feel the pain...

In the morning
You stagger up to start the fight,
You get so lonely...
With no fore-sight until another day!

Run, don't wait for the sun
cause it's setting on you hopes
Don't look far behind for the shadows
They still stands... until the end!

Don't let your pride
make your blood flow cold in vain...
Until the end!

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...

Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high,
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time
to cry and feel the pain...

Run, don't wait for the sun
cause it's setting on you hopes
Don't look far behind for the shadows
They still stands... until the end!

And don't let your pride make your blood flow could in vain...
Until the end!
