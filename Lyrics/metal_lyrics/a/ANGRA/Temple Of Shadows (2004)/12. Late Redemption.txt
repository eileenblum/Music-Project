[During the last moments on the life of this crusader, he is still questioning: "Was I right? Was I wrong?" Memories and thoughts twist his mind. The prisoner is being visited by angels. Or are they demons? Who knows? How can the purest heart judge evil? The Angel of Death stretches his arms and offers a comfortable eternal silence. The Shadow Hunter delivers his body and soul, sure of his Late Redemption.]

You wasted all your chances
To find yourself lost and lonely
Were so foolish
You were selfish
Much too blind to realzie
You messed up your own life...

Eu vou contando os dias
E jÃ¡, jÃ¡ nÃ£o tenho medo
Eu lhe peÃ§o
Eu imploro
Quando a minha hora chegar
Meu descanso minha paz

[ENGLISH TRANSLATION:]
I go on counting my days
And I'm not afraid anymore
I ask you, I beg you
When my time comes
My rest, my peace

In this vain emotion
Over for me!
