To make a world without the fire and burning 
to stop the sword that use for human killing 
to reign the lord who wants just desolation 
to born and rise against suffocation 

you earth mother awake swallow your son 
you earth mother awake swallow 
you earth mother awake swallow your son 
you earth mother awake swallow... your son 

father's pour tears no one sees 
mother's roar fears no one hears 
ominous curse tearing apart my chest 
evil's verse rolling over my nest 

father's pour tears no one sees 
mother's roar fears no one hears 
ominous curse tearing apart my chest 
evil's verse rolling over my nest 

we stepped on the world unaware of vicious cycle 
no hope to leave just feeling reputation 
no chance to take, I am seeking evolution 
we found nothing but total devastation 

to make a world without fire and burning 
to stop the sword that use for human killing 
to reing the lord who wants desolation 
to born and rise against suffocation 

father's pour tears no one sees 
mother's roar fears no one hears 
ominous curse tearing apart my chest 
evil's verse rolling over my nest
