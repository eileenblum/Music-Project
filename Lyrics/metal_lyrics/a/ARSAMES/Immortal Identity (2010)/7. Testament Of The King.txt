When I bid farewell to the poor life 
put me in a coffin made of stone 
place me in my grave 
do not cover my grave 
remind yourself that 
there lies my father 

and now the great king is dead, and I too 
shall one day die like him 

It is human fate, and it makes no difference 
whether you are a king 
or a poor wood-gatherer 
no one remains eternally 
no one remains eternally 
no one remains eternally 

[Clean Vocal] 

When I bid farewell to the poor life 
put me in a coffin made of stone 
place me in my grave 
do not cover my grave 
remind yourself that 
there is lies my father 

Never forget there is a Philosophy 
justice forgiveness and generosity 

now leave me alone, as I feel the hour of my 
death is near 
Leave me alone...
