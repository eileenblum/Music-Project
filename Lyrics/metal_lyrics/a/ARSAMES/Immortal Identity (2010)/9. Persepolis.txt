Standing antiquity on the ground with dignity 
mythic territory that make us proud to be Irani 

kingdom of toleration away from carnage 

majestic throne our cultural heritage 

stay tenecious 

The mountain of courageousness 
there is no fire to destroy your stone 
shining place on our land 

the diamond of Persia 

We never built columns on the blood and genocide 
The symbol of freedom without lashing the masonry 

not to instead of lashing people for masonry 
not for build the columns on the blood and genocide 

there is no fire to destroy your stone 
shining palace on our land 

The diamond of Persia
