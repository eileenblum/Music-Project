Immortal Identity 

I am the king of power the chosen one 
I am the first instructor of human rights 
I invite all to baptism of love and justice 
Washing away diabolical thoughts of your minds and souls 

I am looking for my dreams in heart of darkness 
God will give me forever wings of braveness 
The world full of honest people of mighty God 
Shedding blood is the thing of the past if you decide 

But the world is not gonna be 
As it is expected to be 
there will be an endless game 
between the Lucifer and me 
My troopers will never permit 
Demons to get on their seat 
Paradise is in my hands 
Hell will be under my feet
