Hammering down your head 
wishing your were be dead 
suffering infection and violence 
keeping your mind in silence 

Hatred, sterility, conceited, delict 
carnality, defiant, sacrilege, covetous 
Trait trait trait 
Trait of homo sapiens 
Trait trait 
Trait of homo saphiens 
The cosmos never ends 
nobody defends 
the hell must be you tent 
welcome to your pent 

open your blinded eyes 
all your hopes die 
your cant breath darkness 
surrounds you by reality 
Death comes to claim you 
your brain rotten with pain 
Intenerate velocity 
immersed in pure insanity 

come onnnnnnnn 

Hammering down your head 
wishing your were be dead 
suffering infection and violence 
keeping your mind in silence 

Hatred, sterility, conceited, delict 
carnality, defiant, sacrilege...
