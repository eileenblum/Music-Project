Burn the flame of my inner sight 
I wanna achieve to lighted life 
Monotheism 

you shall lead my soul toward 
the pure thought till i confide 
Monotheism 

lord leads your to kill passion 
Evil spreads temptation 
on wich side should i believe 
who's aware it is deceive 
pervert the creation 
the death and destruction 
how would be situation 
the day of resurrection 

[Repeat 1st Verse]
