Unsuccessful guys in capturing our land 
unsuccessful guys in capturing our blood 
coming with fear and hesitation 
carrying hill of presents on their shoulders 

they're staring with protruded eyes 
looking at the sun but they see nothing 

unsuccessful folks in capturing our bravery 
unsuccessful folks in capturing our glory 
coming with fear and hesitation 
carrying hill of presents on their shoulders 

their souls have shrunk in their corpses 
their minds have been torn in pieces 
defeating all their aces 
we had on our feet their kisses 

our Cyrus gave them culture 
no pain no sigh no torture 
to live in peace is our nature 
not killing like a vulture 

this is the first kingdom of the world (Persian empire) 
the state on the earth as wide as the sun 

unsuccessful guys in capturing our land 
unsuccessful guys in capturing our blood 
coming with fear and hesitation 
carrying hill of presents on their shoulders 

they're staring with protruded eyes 
looking at the sun but they see nothing
