Xerxes comes again to kill persian's pain 
Tyrants call their wages 
wizard and geomancer 
demons come to tyrants 
conspire against the king 
desperately seek a way 
to destroy our power rings 

be ready to die 
enemies of human rights 
be ready to die... 

the thunders of rage will encased you in grave 
evil incantations dead 

dont let them breathe tear them apart 
they will never rise 
evil incantations dead 

Ahura mazda Hear my pray 
on your judgment day 

xerxes army finally decapitate brutality 
wisdom will be born here nowhere you find insanity 
my nation will defend their land to last droop of their blood 
tyranny will be disappeard when my people move like flood
