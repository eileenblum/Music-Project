This city screams war
Donât even pretend that I ever did you wrong
You should suffer for what you have done to me
Â 
Iâll take this hatred and scream it from the rooftops
This is my portal to the world
Everyone will know how
Â 
You took everything that was good and pure
And tore it to shreds
Â 
Iâll rip you apart and burn the remains
As if you were meant for nothing more
Â 
Long ago the seed of hatred was planted
With time it grew and blossomed
I feel that now is the time to let the world see it
This is my portal, my chance to let everyone know
Â 
That youâre nothing but a deceitful coward
All your friends have left but Iâm still standing strong
Â 
You had this coming for far too long
You always said you wanted hate, well here it is
Â 
Love forever cloaked behind a shield of rage
This song is dedicated to you
To letting the whole world know how you fucked away everything I know
Â 
I will never let you take control of any part of me
That part of me is dead
Â 
Everything you are, is everything I hate
I donât hold grudges
I donât cross bridges
I burn them to the ground
