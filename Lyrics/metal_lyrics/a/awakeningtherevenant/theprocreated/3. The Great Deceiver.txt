I abort the souls of the followers
The ones that fall in the hands of God
There is no salvation for the ones that are lied to
Follow me I am your messiah
Your God has abandoned you
Now your forced to stand on your own
So bow to me
I am the one you hate
You are the ones being destroyed by me
The streets will flood with the blood running through your dirty veins Iâm never gone
Iâm always watching
Feel my presence
Itâs upon you
You canât escape me
Iâm the cancer living in your brain
Devouring every inch of life that you have left
Bow your heads and pay respect
This is the greatest
Event your eyes will see
You mother fuckers think you know hardcore
You don't know shit
This us
A slap in the face
Of what you love
You couldn't touch our music
You shouldn't even try
Back down you mother fuckers
We'll bury you alive
Whoâs to say what Iâm doing is wrong?

I'm living to live, you're dying to give me the fix that I need.
I'm more alive, you can't breathe.
You can't see me anymore.
