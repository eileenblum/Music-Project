Here we stand on this precipice
You and I with the world before us
You are given a choice
Take your life
Or Iâll end it for you
No longerÂ 
Will I let myself
Suffer for your transgressions
Your soul shall be torn from your body
And the bloodÂ 
Will spatter the walls of this great hall
You stand in the presence of gods
And youâre not worthyÂ 
Kneel before me
Your life is mine to take
Ripping flesh, crushing bone
Your pain echoes in my brain
And holding your limp corpse
I find my solace
You knew this game wouldn't last forever
It was only a matter of time
Until you were found out
Cowardice can only take you so far
You see me nowÂ 
Through bloodshot eyes
Youâre hoping thatÂ 
The sun will rise
But guess what mother fucker
You'll never see the day
Your final setting has come
You will not last
Hope and pray
Empty prayers find an empty ear listening
All love has abandoned you
Cliches are for the movies
And this isn't a happily ever after
No longerÂ 
Will I let myself
Suffer for your transgressions
Your soul has been torn from your body
