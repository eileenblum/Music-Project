This is my redemption
This is my path to salvation
A path traced in your blood

You will never let me feel this love again
My eyes blinded by hatred
Your sacrifice will be nothing compared to mine
You deserve so much more than this

Iâve held this back for far too long
You mean nothing now
I hope you're listening to this
Iâm calling you the fuck out

I dig my nails into your flesh

No hope for my salvation
I am my own savior; I donât need your weakness

You held your masquerade for too long
A sinner, a saint, you canât pretend Iâm wrong
Cutting these ties and throwing you out
Shouldâve meant nothing so much longer ago.

Nothing more than dirt you shall remain
Iâll find satisfaction in knowing
Youâre far more miserable than I

You backstabbing prick
Fuck everything you are
This is my chance
This is me calling you out

Forgive but never forget
This is my redemption
Like a phoenix I will rise from these ashes to tear you apart
I will never wash your blood from my hands
Itâll serve to remind me of the horrors caused
This is my redemption
I will forgive, but I can never forgetÂ 

This is my redemption.

Paralyzed by the fear that you'll never die
Iâll do anything I can to ensure your misery

This has never been such a sweet release
Your blood streaming through my fingers
I have never felt so alive

This has been coming for far too long (Shatter the ties, and let you die)
You will die alone and empty (And I would love to be there)
To watch you fall
