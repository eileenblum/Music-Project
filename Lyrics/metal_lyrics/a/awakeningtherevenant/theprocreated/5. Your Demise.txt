When you spread your legs youâre spreading your deceit
A useless fucking whore

Fuck you, you piece of shit
The putrid stench of your rotting soul makes me cringe

And the time will come when you rue the day
The day that you crushed all
Only to stand on the limp corpses to raise yourself to new heights
I will be standing there
To ensure your demise goes as planned.

Fuck you and everything you are
I can smell your fear this wonât get any easier
Once you back down thatâs when suffering will begin

Donât call out to God to save you now
Iâm the only one that decides if you live or die
For too long Iâve waited idly at your side

The time has come
Get on your fucking knees

Your tears feed my destruction
The cries of you and your loved ones make me kill
I will never fall iâm the Alpha, the Omega.
Â 
You say the words, Iâll never close my eyes
You say the words, Iâll never let this hatred die

Close your eyes
Iâll grab you by the neck and rip you from limb to limb
