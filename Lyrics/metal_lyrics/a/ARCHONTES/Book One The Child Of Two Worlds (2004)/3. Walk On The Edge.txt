Keep inciting me
Unchain my heart
One who lives in dark
Needs a spark

Keep inciting me,
Insanity
You live in my mind
Only life in dreams
Can make me free
And dirt stays behind

Dirt is oppressing me
Save me, Dark
I'm almost home
But they call me back

No!

Deep inside in me
I feel your breath
My true only love
I walk on the edge
About to fall
Cause I've got enough

Oh God, please help me

I close my eyes
And regain my soul
My life's in my hands...
It's just a dream
I'm just a passion
Shadow

I walk on the edge
I'm free
And my path lies across the line
But I must return
No!
