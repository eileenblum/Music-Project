Through the shadow comes another day
Time's up â no one can ever play with fate
It's nice to feel you near â insanity

Just one step â I've got my faith but I'm blind
But the lights are out â curtain's down
No turn around

Goodbye, New World!
Time to go
My heart does not belong to you
Goodbye, New World!
I promise I do not turn back
Your soul is dead, vain glory rules the ball

You think my dreams are insanity
My tears make you laugh and watch me with hostility
Well I'm just a joker my share is misery

Farewell! I will not wake you in your sleep
Enjoy your routine â deep within â you're living machine

Goodbye, New World!
Time to go
My heart is not a part of you
Goodbye, New World!
Some day you must look back and see
What you have built
You'll see just shattered souls

Just one step â But I'm blind
But the lights are out â curtain's down
No turn around

Goodbye, New World!
Time to go
My heart does not belong to you
Goodbye, New World!
I promise I do not turn back
Your soul is dead, vain glory rules the ball
