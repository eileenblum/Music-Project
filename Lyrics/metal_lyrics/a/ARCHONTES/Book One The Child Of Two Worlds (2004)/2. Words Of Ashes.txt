Surrounded by battle â death is everywhere â
I'm struck and I'm clenching my sword
I know â it's impossible, but it seems so real,
it's shattering my inner world

It ain't easy part
No light on my way

The vision is fading, the feelings get dim, expelled by the pressure of dawn
But my eyelids close, and I hear the voice â the voice I have already known
Hear us calling! Open your mind! You must understand what you are.
But words are ashes, their meaning's just dust â fading but leaving a scar

It ain't easy part
No light on my way
These dreams burn my heart
Real World's gone astray

Strange voice breaks through the dark
And lures up high
Mercy! I lose control
So die!

Leave me alone!

Strange voice breaks through the dark
And lures up high
Mercy! I lose control
My world's turning upside down

Your voice breaks through the dark
And lures up high
Mercy! I lose control
So die!

Hear us! Trust us! Open the gate!
