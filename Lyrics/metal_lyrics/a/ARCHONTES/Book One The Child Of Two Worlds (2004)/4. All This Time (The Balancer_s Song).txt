Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said
not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
[John Chapter 21]

Balancer: ââ Are you lost? I will show you the way, trust me!
â Who are you?

So many years ago
I have chosen my path
Without fear and doubt
I keep on believing

Every day I've lived
Is burned with iron in my mind
Age by age goes by
And I feel old pain
When I close again my eyes
Pain of days I've lived

So many years have passed
I've been waiting for your birth
A child with tainted blood
Blood of the ancients
That has slept through centuries
Child of two worlds
Child who is the key
So I'm
The guardian of light
Keeping the spark of faith
So bright

Your way's
The ancient line
I close my eyes and see
The sign

All this time
