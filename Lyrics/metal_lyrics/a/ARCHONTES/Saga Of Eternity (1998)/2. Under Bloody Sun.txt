I see another day falling down with lies
I see Tomorrow - that's my bloody curse
I feel my rage again - the Bloody Sun will rise
So Joker cry out - you have lost!
Fire
In my soul
Spawns shadows
Erases my eyes
My Gift
Is stronger,
But madness
Is a terrible price

You've returned but understand me right
Fly away back home
So many years - why did you come here now
To rule or separate?

I don't know the words of love
I was born for might
The greatest power was given me by Gods
It's not my choice -
Just a roll of dice
So Joker cry out...
You're just a shadow
Darkness
In my soul
Scaring
And killing my mind
Tell me
My Master
Did you know?
Or were you so blind?

Under Bloody Sun
I lead you
The Time has come
Our way
Is so long
But never close your eyes in darkness
Try to see the light
We see the light
Misleading light
