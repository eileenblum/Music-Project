Dedicated to Kurt Vonnegut
"You'll pretend you were men instead of babies, and you'll be played
in the movies by Frank Sinatra and John Wayne or some of those
other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men. And war will look just
wonderful, so we'll have a lot more of them. And they'll be fought by
babies like the babies upstairs."
Kurt Vonnegut "Slaughterhouse - Five or The Children's Crusade"

Favourite toys turn people to trash
Don't know if I see tomorrow
Fire and lead devour my flesh
Wild fear drowns my sorrow

Fog of death eclipses the morning sun
Screams and cries - that's music of war
Rush for tomorrow try to live one more day
Or your body is taken home
... in a wooden box

Long time ago we had different way
You could decide what to die for
With a sword in your hand and your homeland to save
Man, not breakfast for shells

We see the morning sun
And we know that life is fun
We don't want
To die
We are tired
Of lies
We just want to live in peace
These "wars of deliverance"
Like a gold mine that never ends
We don't want
To fight
For somebody's
False pride
Treat us just - we're also people

Children's crusade...
Crusade...
I see through the clouds - a faint ray of hope
I know after storm sun will shine
And darkness will have to retreat
Dark...
