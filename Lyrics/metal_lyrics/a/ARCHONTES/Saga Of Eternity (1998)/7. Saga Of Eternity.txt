I see stars up high
Shining ever so bright
Far away from home I look to the sky
Keeping the stars alive
Ways of darkness and light
Quest for glory and might
Never dies
Kept by the fire inside
Always walk through the land
My path never ends
I will know
When the time has come

I can see burning paradise
Will I live forever
Kingdom Come - not for me
Found the truth inside
I'm here they're far away
I will live forever
Kingdom Come - the price I pay
I am on my way

Saga of Eternity
Power rages on
Fire everlasting
Open the gate and hail the storm
Burning again, over and over again

So my story goes
I feel no remorse
Every day
Brings its own curse
There is people's way
They will run astray
Nothing lasts
Ashes fall into grave

But I want to escape from fate
Want to live forever
Kingdom Come - it's not too late
So open the gate
Rearrange the masterplan
Now and forever
Kingdom Come - I claim my own
Now immortal man

Saga of Eternity
Power drives me on
Hope everlasting
Have to be strong to carry on
Dreaming again, over and over again

Death is enemy
Fight on to be free
This is the ultimate mission for me
It's so easy to see
No need to define
What is wrong or right
Watching the sky, watching my life
I will set it right

Rearrange the masterplan
Now and forever
Kingdom Come - I claim my own
Now immortal man
I'm here they're far away
I will live forever
Kingdom Come - the price I pay
I am on my way

Saga of Eternity
Finally I have won
Life everlastng
Hail the power for time has come!
Scream it again, over and over again

No need to define
What is wrong or right
Watching the sky, watching my life
I will set it right
I see stars up high
Shining ever so bright
Far away from home I look to the sky
Keeping the stars alive
