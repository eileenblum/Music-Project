Shadows
Lie on my past - I know...
Dreaming
My hope makes me so strong

Looking through my life forever
Lost in reality again
Winds of Dust
Blow away all souls
Leave me be, my Guarding Angel
Or reality'll come back

Understand my true life's
...In the Dark

Calling
Syringe thrown me from the skies
Freedom
My daydreams transcend your lies

Looking through my life forever
Lost in reality again
Winds of Dust
Blow away all souls
Leave me be, my Guarding Angel
Or reality'll come back

I close my eyes
And I welcome the dawn

It is my last chance to escape - I know...
But don't take it away from me
Heal my body and break my soul
Gods Of The White Walls
I'm far away - here my journey's over
