I am the Word
The Word is me
My Hope's The Gate
My Fear's The Key
Where the Shadow of Fear lies
Only I remain
The Dark One dies
The Shadow is my twin
Living in another world
The world of my dreams
When Reality removes its blindfold
Gates, open up!
Into the world I strive
The World Where Shadows Come To Life
