The rhythm of our rebellion rises along with the poison drops which are
administered to us.
The pendulum of rage starts measuring the time which separates our assassins from their end. Its swings pomp hate in our veins.
The sparkles of our eyes appear in the dark like lethal glowing worms, piranhas of the air.
The sound of our revenge rises along with the hate drops which are administered to us.
The pendulum of rage starts measuring the time which separates our assassins from their end. Its swings pomp hate in our veins.
We are all singing and our voices split the spotless sky glass. Pieces of broken sky are falling upon us like a blessed snow.
Weâre the characters of an apocalyptic scenery, weâre exploring the purgatory in which we forgot when weâve drowned!
We are all running shoulder to shoulder chasing the dust of our victimsâ running!
Our burning breath feels more and more tormenting for their maddened brains!
Come on we are so close! Come-come we are so close!
Our strokes inspired by the pendulum count the martial tempo of the fight,
youâre ours, we donât forgive you! The fate is like a fortuneâs wheel, itâs our turn to spin the steering wheel, weâre intoxicated with your fear!
The rage starts measuring the time which separates our assassins from their end. Its swings pomp hate in our veins!
