The confessions of my sins were etched into my skin
Uroboric sculptures tattoo my body as if in a
Ritual of a lost religion
What is this echo?
A message on my skin
Past generations
Are talking through my pores
It's a cypher
You can't break into
Unfamiliar sounds
Enforce a beat
What is picture?
A message on my skin
Unreal colours
Design my destiny
My heart stops the beatings of another one
My pores are pumping by a certain order
Opened like scared mouths or horrified eyes hypnotized
I feel the atavistic claws penetrating my skin
Fingers causing tiny rifts beyond repair
