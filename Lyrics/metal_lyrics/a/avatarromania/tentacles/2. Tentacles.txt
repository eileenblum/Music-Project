Like a samurai i have accurately cut the strings that kept me connected to this life
I blindly made a heap to the other realm ruled lustfully by your nocturnal star
I reached the perfection of an androgynous and experimented the painful ecstasy
And the sweet suffering i'm the king of senses
I am tied by unseen tentacles i am my own prisoner
But all these happened in the past now i'm running nowhere like an atom
I don't know who i'm hiding of i'm captive in a dream i'm keeping inside
Of me the reminder of your touch
Heaven and hell were melted by my mind in a single substance
