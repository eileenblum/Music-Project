The first thing i remember is the pain in my eyes penetrating my brain an invisible force was crushing me and my glance broke with a hollow sound
Then i was forced to swim in a swampy river swarming with snakes i sneaked through a crowd of spectres which froze me and i was captured and crucified
I'm dying now and my euphoria will end i'm trying to remember the taste of the potion a liquid death-that is what i want, a body oozing like in a placenta
Women with hairy faces kissed me suffocating me with revulsion and they rifled through my mind tightening my nerves just like bloody worms
In gloomy castles were exposed my twenty nails and on parchments mad put of my skin they wrote about dying bacchus
