I agonize in the darkness i play my last card
I feel rough legs of insects crawling on my
Skin if i'll see them i'll lose my mind
The cubic room turns like a tetris i fall down
On a wet pavement
I'm lost in the deepest corner of my mind
I feel like an unborn child
I rise i feel an undefined threat
I open a door walk into a church the sounds
Disturb the solemnity
I get out i'm in a brothel grotesque masks grin at me
I'm lost in the deepest corner of my mind
Cold weapons are ready to execute me
What was this? a nightmare? am i saved now?
I wake up the rough insects are crawling on my skin
