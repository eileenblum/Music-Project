I run through my desert my mind is a giant desert with skin broken dry i run around weightless i pass by bones similar to pieces of a domino as if i belong to an evolution cycle towards nothing
I see explorers who have lost the battle with the desert of minds and gone i discover that i lose the battle against myself and those fallen around are just like me
I'm the last piece of the game it's an interior domino upon me from the past i feel a long line of defeats, failure is a part of me i am condemned by a
Biological curse i am possessed and i know it even the universe contains in itself the seed of its death

I run towards nothing
