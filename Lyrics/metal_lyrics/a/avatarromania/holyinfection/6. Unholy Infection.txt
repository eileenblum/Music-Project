Sometimes our body lives
Apart from our consciousness
Faces can be the cause of the rebellion

The strange movements of the bowels
Announce a visceral revolt:
A slight tear and a hidden throb
The putrefaction yeasts ceaselessly

Sickness eats everything away
Like a huge, monstrous worm stench invades
The land of the deadly burst riddles
The overflows a flood of bowels
The colon spreaces out,
The bones of the anus crack terribly
The creature drown in an ocean of excreta
