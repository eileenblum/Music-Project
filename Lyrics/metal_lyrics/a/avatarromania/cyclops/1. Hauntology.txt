Alone I float in the lonely night
Careful I watch the darkened town

The town comes to life
Streets, building, people I see
Touched by my breath
They become more lonely

My presence is like full moon
Awaking hidden desires in people
My occult breeze resembles to a possession
In their souls, people turn to were-wolf

My obscure world has no logic
In my fist I control the human minds

Foolishness and dementia turn into normality under my sign
I'm like a plague, I contaminate, nightly hypnosis rules in town
