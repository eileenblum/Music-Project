I tasted loneliness as the sweetest lust in a confession to myself drawing frantically

My creations were the weirdest of self-portraits

In my dreams I felt an arrow stuck in my eye bleeding socket mutilating my entire face

And the years went by blindness remained an obsession of mine

Destiny though reminded me of my nightmare
Unseen hands of life hit me and my gaze turned hazy

As time went by I thought that everything will be lost in a shapeless past
I am like a cyclops

The mutilated on the canvas was created by my sober inspiration

Blindness was fulfilled just like a prophecy of a darkened ecstasy

I from the mirror find myself now as the self-portraits of yesterday
I am like a cyclops
