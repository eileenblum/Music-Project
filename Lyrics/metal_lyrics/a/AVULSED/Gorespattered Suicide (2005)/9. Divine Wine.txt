The red wine
In this monastery
Is being treated
In a special way

The divine wine

Of dark red tones
With subtle flavor
Slightly fruity
Slightly meaty
Strict fermentation
With additives
That no one knows
Theyâre exclusive

Human meat gives the taste
Years in barrels does the rest

Acids of meat in decomposition mixed with wine
Provides a taste that canât be obtained through normal process
Thatâs the secret that monks keep so well for their delicious wine

Missing parishioners are usually their ingredients
