Beyond my culinary knowledge
I found a fascinating flavour
The subtle taste of human flesh
Something thatâs usually taboo

Rich in proteins
And unlimited
Human bodies will never end
Tons of people die every day

Eating human corpses
Donât turn me into a criminal
If I donât kill anyone
Who cares whatâs my food...
I just take cadavers
From morgues and graveyards
Fuck the worms, itâs my food
Iâm gonna take it all

Biceps, things and gluteus
Are the most tender meaty parts
I have to take them all
Before they start to rot away

Beyond my culinary knowledge
I found a fascinating flavour
The subtle taste of human flesh
Something thatâs usually taboo

I have an oddity
I like my meat overdone
I like my meat nearly burnt
Burnt but Not Carbonized

Lost of crusty human ribs
Succulent red entercode
Tasty well-done steak
A human barbecue

Eating human corpses
Donât turn me into a criminal
If I donât kill anyone
Who cares whatâs my food...
I just take cadavers
From morgues and graveyards
Fuck the worms, itâs my food
Iâm gonna take it all

I have an oddity
I like my meat overdone
I like my meat nearly burnt
Burnt but Not Carbonized
