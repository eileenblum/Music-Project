I claw my way through your chest
Your maimed torso spewing forth blood
Ribs broken wide apart
To reveal a sewage filled cavity

Helpless... you squirm
As I breathe my sickness into you
Lifeless... you succumb
As I breed myself through you

Filth injected
Breeding the spawn of rot inside
Filth crawling reeking through
Every possible orifice

Helpless... you squirm
As I breathe my sickness into you
Lifeless... you succumb
As I breed myself through you

Filth injected

Your clottered veins
Filled with my disease
Your corpse vastly bloated
To the verge of bursting

I have sown a seed of death
And your dying flesh will harbor me
As I rejuvenate my putrid hate
And hatch inside your carcass

Regurgitated innards flow
Vomited through a slashed throat
I am the one reborn
To fester on humanity

Filth injected
