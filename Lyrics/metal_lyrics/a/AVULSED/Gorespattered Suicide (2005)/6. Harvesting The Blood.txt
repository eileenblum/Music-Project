I am the spreader of disease and sickness
A harvest of flesh is what I need
I thrive on human suffering
Endlessly I submit them to my greed

Licking the blade before I slide it in
Out pours memories, life and sin
The fluid you leak is what feeds my desire
Repeatedly I stab again and again

Iâm the soul collector
The usurper of lives
I pronounce the sentence
The sentence of death

A robber of time as your death is premature
Ripping lives apart is what Iâm living for
The sweet stench of human decay
As you fear my deed, resign and bleed

I am the spreader of disease and sickness
A harvest of flesh is what I need
I thrive on human suffering
Endlessly I submit them to my greed

Licking the blade before I slide it in
Out pours memories, life and sin
The fluid you leak is what feeds my desire
Repeatedly I stab again and again

Harvesting the blood
The dreams I have are drenched in blood
Festering the flesh
Through in human form my acts are of god

Iâm the soul collector
The usurper of lives
I pronounce the sentence
The sentence of death
