Cold cadavers open wide
In the dissecting stretcher with rigid factions
Eviscerating limbs nearly petrified
Reeking viscous fluids in livid putrefaction

But to avoid these nauseous odours
The only way is a living autopsy
Getting high patients with perfect health
Flesh palpitating organs to extract

Bright kidneys, spongy pulmons, dense liver
Juicy spleen, red meaty heart
Hot pancreas, slimy stomach, gooey urethra
Relaxed backbone, twisted intestine

4 n sick

To get a perfect unknown candidate
It had to be a worthless homeless without any family

Male or female any sex was fine
Nobody will miss a piece of white trash in his society

It was weary to work with corpses
To improve a promising forensic career
Extracting living innards is the biggest experience
It canât be compared, itâs pure gore

4 n sick
