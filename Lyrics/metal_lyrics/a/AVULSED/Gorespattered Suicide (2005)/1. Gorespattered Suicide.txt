Suicide in gore

I am so tired of my filthy life
Obscenity has always been my way

Depraved thoughts often rounded my mind
But I am proud of what I did so far

I tasted it all. Any aberration
My sick mind was so unpure, I had no control
But in my life Iâm not alone, Iâve my bloody love
Who shares my visions, my macabre lusts?

Blood... an axe... a gun... Gorespattered suicide

Necrophilia was so cold, necrophagia was...
The tasteless I could eat
Sadomasochistic sex was a childrenâs game...
I felt no more pain

So I decided to commit suicide
I thought about the goriest way to end with my life
Iâll shot my brains out with a gun in front of my girl
So in case I have no guts, she will chop my head off

Blood... an axe... a gun... Gorespattered suicide
