A Buried Crime
Forgotten Adultery
A Bastard Son
Breeding Into The Corpse
Under Grave Clothes
Foetus Incubated
Placenta Reeks
Post-Mortem Pregnancy

[Chorus:]
Condemned To Darkness
In A Cold Tomb
Sterile Womb
Cradle Of Bones

Born In The Vault
Beneath The Cemetery
Unfertile Nest
Suckled By Rottenness
Hungry And Forlorn
He's Crying Underground
Maternal Love
Turned In A Pile Of Worms

[Chorus:]
Condemned To Darkness
In A Cold Tomb
Sterile Womb
Cradle Of Bones

Unsheltered Creation, Fruit Of Hate
Posthumous Protection
Warm Of Fermentation
First Vital Deception, Obscurity
Accidental Gestation
Growing In Putrefaction

Existence In Pestilence
Surviving By Himself
Awaiting For His Revenge
Someday He Will Arise (Dead)

Born In The Vault
Beneath The...
[Repeat All This Verse]

[Chorus:]
Condemned To Darkness
In A Cold Tomb
Sterile Womb
Cradle Of Bones
