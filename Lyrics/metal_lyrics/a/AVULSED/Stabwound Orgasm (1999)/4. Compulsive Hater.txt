[music: cabra 10/98]
[lyrics: dave rotten]

grown into a world
of preconceived ideals
father, mother, sister,
doggy and landscaped cottage

affectionless rearing
his whole family
was like unkown
neighbours to him
he applied to them
by their first names
no signs of respect
towards his own family

[chorus 1]
totally scorned
ill mannered
and restrained
no human values
no self respect
a poor repressed

still at the age of 24
he didn't even drink alcohol
was proud of his virginity
(but) in fact he was just fearful
of being able to fulfil
in front of a naked woman
so he decided to hate girls
to cover his sexual problem

[chorus 2]
he hated friends
he hated his parents
he hated women
he hated humans

it was the only feeling
he felt by his own
hate was his only
self pro-claimed virtue
was the easiest way
to escape from reality
no laughs, no love
no signs of gratitude

[chorus 1]
totally scorned
ill mannered
and restrained
no human values
no self respect
a poor repressed

but in the eyes of his friends
he looked like a normal guy
he even seemed really charming
hiding his real inner feelings
he was a perfect stereotype
of a potential psychopath
a nice person from outside
natural born hater inside

[chorus 2]
he hated friends
he hated his parents
he hated women
he hated humans
