[music: furni 1/99]
[lyrics: dave rotten]

disguised by a soutane
prasing the name of god
concealing his perversity
behind a forced smile

respected parish priest
none would suspect on him
keeping people away from sin
he was just selecting

pedophilia with babies
anal sex with young boys
deflowering of harmless girls
and necrophilia after all

deranged by tender kids 
bloodfeast with easy preys
lacerating to feel their pain
quartering corpses for lunch

blessed by gore!! [x4]

no witness could survive
to his macabre vision of lust
all cadavers dissappeared
buried, burnt or food for dogs

a perturbed mind
chose church to kill
a perfect alibi
left unpunished

blessed by gore!! [x4]
