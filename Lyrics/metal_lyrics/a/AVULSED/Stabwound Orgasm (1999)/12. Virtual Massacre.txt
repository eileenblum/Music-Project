[music: furni 9/98]
[lyrics: dave rotten]

a perverse mind, with no remorse
frustrated boy, sexually repressed
confined into, his somber bedroom
with a computer, and tons of games

sheer violence, an obsession
potential murder, fake misanthrope
annihilation, of human race
a fantasy, through the games

[pre-chorus]
blood everywhere
no survivors
with cruelty
killing them all

virtual massacre [x2]

a peaceful burger, riddled with bullets
a football stadium, sprayed with napalm
the underground filled, with lethal gas
a supermarket, blown away

[pre-chorus]
blood everywhere
no survivors
with cruelty
killing them all

virtual massacre [x2]

virtual massacre [x2]

nobody knows, his identity
no need to worry, it is not real
a virtual game, but after all
he's got his hands, full of red blood
