[music: juancar 2/99]
[lyrics: dave rotten]

a realm of sickness - with rotting landscapes
gory red skies - nauseating air
a hidden hell - for tortured souls
decomposition - is everywhere

[chorus:]
feeding from souls - of melting corpses
absorbing power - and evilness
amorphous being - mighty entity
an eminence - in putrescence

a long deep cave - (its) macabre palace
bleeding cadavers - instead of walls
blood, bile, pus - dripping around
forming the river - of rottenness

[chorus:]
feeding from souls - of melting corpses
absorbing power - and evilness
amorphous being - mighty entity
an eminence - in putrescence

a putrid stench - pervade the ambience
fermenting innards - decomposed limbs

the twisted bodies - screaming in pain
soulless remnants - left to rot

a realm of sickness - with rotting landscapes
gory red skies - nauseating air
a hidden hell - for tortured souls
decomposition - is everywhere

[chorus:]
feeding from souls - of melting corpses
absorbing power - and evilness
amorphous being - mighty entity
an eminence - in putrescence
