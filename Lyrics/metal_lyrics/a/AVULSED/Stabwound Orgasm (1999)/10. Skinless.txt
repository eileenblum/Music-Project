[music: furni 6/98]
[lyrics: dave rotten]

beauty obsession

horror to decay
she didn't want - time to pass
aesthetic surgery
the only way - to keep youth

[chorus:]
deformed
human freak
monstrous
skinless

clinic was her home
the surgeon - her best friend
transforming body parts
no matter what - again and again

[chorus:]
deformed
human freak
monstrous
skinless

but her skin - was getting - emaciated
every time - a surgery - was done
she didn't know - her cells - couldn't resist
so many - transplants - from others' skin

amorphous livid cheekbones
distorted burnt eyebrows
skinned bleeding bruised lips
crushed rotting tight nose
sunken scratched forehead
dislocated deformed jaw

her face was totally disfigured
beauty turned into rotting skin
her perdition was to be conceited
now she's got a horrid grotesque face

[chorus:]
deformed
human freak
monstrous
skinless

[chorus:]
deformed
human freak
monstrous
skinless
