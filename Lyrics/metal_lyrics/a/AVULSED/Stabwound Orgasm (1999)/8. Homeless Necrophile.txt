[music: furni 7/98]
[lyrics: dave rotten]

worthless drunk loser
withdrawn on his own misery
hater of mankind
despised any help to his suffering
neglected by society
left apart by his own family
he even enjoys his state
eating shit and sleeping on the streets

[pre-chorus]
now he feels that he's totally free
to unleash his own perversity
and be what he wished to be
a despicable human being

[chorus:]
uncontrollable homeless necrophile
aggressive homeless necrophile
abominable homeless necrophile
psychopath homeless necrophile

creating his own living rules
nobody's gonna tell him what to do
no room for conscience or morality 
only the strongest will survive

always struggling with other homeless
for no reason
with a knife in his pocket waiting for revenge
but once he tasted the power of killing he couldn't resist
then he felt he had to kill and kill and kill:

a simple argument
was enough to slay any man
and when the victim was a she
then he had to free his sexuality
necrophilia was
his fave act of brutality
a cold and frigid corpse
no screams, no face and obedience

[pre-chorus]
now he feels that he's totally free
to unleash his own perversity
and be what he wished to be
a despicable human being

[chorus:]
uncontrollable homeless necrophile
aggressive homeless necrophile
abominable homeless necrophile
psychopath homeless necrophile
