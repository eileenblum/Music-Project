[Music: Cabra '95/96]
[Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

Man's Perversion
Goes Beyond
His Own Imagination

Gore Movies
Are Not Enough
To Make Him Feel A Real Situation

He Wants To Use
Real Human Preys
To Catch Their True Panic Expression

No Special Effects
No Fucking Tricks
Authentic Victims Will Be Sacrificed

The Easiest Way Is To Fool A Slut
And Convince Her To Take Part In A Film

A Hidden House In A Forlorn Wood
Where Nobody Can Hear Her Dying Screams

The Hooker Is Raped
And Tied To The Bed
While Sadistic Tortures Are Being Performed
Both Hands' Fingers
Are Being Cut In Slices
And She's Looking At Herself Writhing With Painful Howls

Crushing Her Arms
With A Hammer
And Later Hacking Them With An Axe

Avulsing Her Legs
With Sudden Stretchings
Splashing All Around With Her Hot And Thick Blood

The Easiest Way Is To Fool A Slut
And Convince Her To Take Part In A Film

A Hidden House In A Forlorn Wood
Where Nobody Can Hear Her Dying Screams

Later This Film
Will Be Spreaded
Around Maniacs
With His Same Taste

Unfortunately
Those Kinds Of Crimes
Are Still Being Done
Even More Every Day
