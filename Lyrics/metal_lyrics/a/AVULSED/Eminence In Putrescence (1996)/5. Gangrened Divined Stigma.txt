[Music: Avulsed '93]
[Lyrics: Avulsed]

The Divine Revelation
In Form Of Bleeding Nail Wounds
I'm Marked With The Sign - Of God!!

New Christ's Reincarnation
Or Just Hallucinations??
Am I Only A Paranoid - Or Not??

[1st Chorus:]
Two Ever-Bleeding Stigmas - Pierce My Hands
Although I Was Never Crucified
I'm Admired By Christians Like A Saint
Like A New Messiah... Worship Me!!

Holy Manifestations
It's Turning Into Infection
Purulence Grows Under - The Gore!!

Intense Suppuration
Necrotic Emanations
Smell The Real Stench - Of Rot!!

[1st Chorus:]
Two Ever-Bleeding Stigmas - Pierce My Hands
Although I Was Never Crucified
I'm Admired By Christians Like A Saint
Like A New Messiah... Worship Me!!

[2nd Chorus:]
The Holy God's - Revelation
It's Turning In - Putrefaction

Infected, Putrid, Rotting

Gangrened Divine Stigma

Gangered Sores Spreading Fast Among My Skin
My Skin!!
Rotten Limbs Should Be Avulsed Off The Trunk
Off The Trunk!!

[1st Chorus:]
Two Ever-Bleeding Stigmas - Pierce My Hands
Although I Was Never Crucified
I'm Admired By Christians Like A Saint
Like A New Messiah... Worship Me!!

[2nd Chorus:]
The Holy God's - Revelation
It's Turning In - Putrefaction

Now I Feel A Demon Inside Me And Says:
And Says:
"Take A Knife And Cut Off Your Own Arm Right Now
Right Now!!
Mutilate Yourself Or Rot Forever,
Do It Now!!"
My Faith Is Gone - I'm Decaying
Maimed And Alone - And Forsaken
Covered With Blood - A Knife In My Hand
A Crude End - As Bloody As Ever!!
