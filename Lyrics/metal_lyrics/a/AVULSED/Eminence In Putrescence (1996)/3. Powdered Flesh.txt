[Music: Avulsed '94]
[Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

[1st Chorus:]
Difficult Storage
Impossible To Conserve
Flesh Is So Corruptible
Freezing Is Not Enough

[2nd Chorus:]
There Are So Many Victims
Meat Starts To Pile Up
Stench Of Putrefaction
Is Invading My Home

[3rd Chorus:]
Anxiety For Killing
Is Stroonger Than Me
Human Flesh Is So Tasty
I'm Living Tangled In Fucking Gore!!

My Chemical Knowledge
Could Be My Solution
The Key To My Problems
Is Based On Experimentation!!

It Must Be Something Light
Which Doesn't Occupy Stace
And Imposible To Rot
Dust!!

Blood!!

Drying Up The Flesh
Through Complex Proceeding
Extracting All Liquids
And Grinding All The Mass

Just Adding Blood
The Freshest Blood!!
The Powdered Flesh
Once Again Fresh!!

Countless Moulds
Millions Of Forma!!
Ready To Eat
Do You Want A Bit??

[1st Chorus:]
Difficult Storage
Impossible To Conserve
Flesh Is So Corruptible
Freezing Is Not Enough

[2nd Chorus:]
There Are So Many Victims
Meat Starts To Pile Up
Stench Of Putrefaction
Is Invading My Home

My Dismembered Bodies
Have Left To Be A Problem For Me
All These Nauseous Odours
Won't Be Anymore!!

This Will Be My Secret
I Won't Share It With No One Else
My Conscience Is Clean
Let All Flesh Rot!!

[3rd Chorus:]
Anxiety For Killing
Is Stroonger Than Me
Human Flesh Is So Tasty
I'm Living Tangled In Fucking Gore!!
