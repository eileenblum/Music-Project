[Music: Juancar '96]
[Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

Nobody May Wonder, My Deep Secret Thoughts,
Judging By My Look
Nice And Friendly Guy, A Respectable Job,
Nothing To Complain About
Everyone Who Knows Me, Would Never Imagine,
My Inner Cruelty
They Would Never Think, That Today Or Tomorrow,
They Could Be The Next

But Here I Am, With One Of My Victims,
Her Body Is Fully Gagged
A Badly Bruised Face, Razor Blade Cuts,
All Over Her Legs
Deformed Bloody Holes, That Used To Be Nipples,
Emanating Blood
Lubricated Cunt, After Many Of My
Beastly Penetrations

[1st Chorus:]
I Don't Even Know
Who This Bitch Is Anymore
Always I Forget Them
They All Look The Same To Me

[1st Chorus:]
I Don't Even Know
Who This Bitch Is Anymore
Always I Forget Them
They All Look The Same To Me

My Mind Is Transformed
And I Become A Beast
The Most Perverted Thoughts
Are Controlling My Acts

Inhuman Vexations
Even Cannibalistic Rites
Pleasures Of The Flesh
Their Bloody Corpse Is My Lust

[2nd Chorus:]
And Worst Of All, Is That I Enjoy This Shit
But When I've Finished, I Disgust Myself
It's Like Being In A Blinding Trance
Where I Only Follow My Repressed Instincts

[2nd Chorus:]
And Worst Of All, Is That I Enjoy This Shit
But When I've Finished, I Disgust Myself
It's Like Being In A Blinding Trance
Where I Only Follow My Repressed Instincts
