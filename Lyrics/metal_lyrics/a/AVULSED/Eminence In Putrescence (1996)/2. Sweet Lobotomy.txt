[Music: Furni '96]
[Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

Searching Through The Gloomy Night
An Innocent Young Student
Mainly Girls, Mainly Gays
They Are The Weakest Preys

Lurking In The Darkness
Surprising Them From Behind
A Hard Strike On The Head
Snatching Their Consciousness

The Corpse Must Be Alive
While He Takes It To His Home
Then Bound To An Armchair
Down In The Basement

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shaving The Head
And Drawing Pattern Lines
Right Over The Skin
Where To Make The Cut

Opening The Skull
Exposing His Brain
The Victim Is Still Alive
Shrieking In Pain

[Chorus x2:]
A Spoonful Of Grey Mass
Sweet Lobotomy

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shaving The Head
And Drawing Pattern Lines
Right Over The Skin
Where To Make The Cut

[Chorus x2:]
A Spoonful Of Grey Mass
Sweet Lobotomy

It's His Debility, A Delicious Caprice
Only Reserved To Privileged Minds

Every Neuron Must Be Alive
Right From The Skull To His Mouth

All His Knwoledge Will Be Increased
Eating The Biggest Amount Of Brains
