[Music: Furni '95/96]
[Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

Several Years Of Scatiness
And Misery
Eastern Lands Of Communist
Government

His Job - In The Municipal Morgue
Gave Him Money Just To Survive
For His Own Necessities And Nothing Else

Solitary Life, No Compromise
Morgue's Boss
He's Responsible, He's Got The Keys
Whole Disposition

A Room - Full Of Unknown Cadavers
Nobody Will Miss One Corpse A Month
After All They're Just Fucking Dead Beggars

[Chorus:]
Frozen Meat - In Perfect State Of Preservation
Human Flesh Is Tender And Sweet
Livid, Cold And Soft - The Abdomen Is So Tasty
And The Thighs Are Really Consistent

[Chorus:]
Frozen Meat - In Perfect State Of Preservation
Human Flesh Is Tender And Sweet
Livid, Cold And Soft - The Abdomen Is So Tasty
And The Thighs Are Really Consistent

Roasted Ribs, Fried Innards
Biceps Fillets, Thigh Stew
Minced Fingers, Tongue In Sauce
Bones For Stock, Brain Sherbet

Every Body Part Can Always Be Thrifty
Typical Prejudices Must Be Left Apart
When Salary Is Too Low And Nobody Can Help You
You'll Have To Learn To Search For Food Everywhere

Many People Are Dying Of Famine
But Cannibalism Is Still Taboo
Tons Of Delightful Mean Are Being Wasted
Leaving Them To Rot Into Their Tombs
