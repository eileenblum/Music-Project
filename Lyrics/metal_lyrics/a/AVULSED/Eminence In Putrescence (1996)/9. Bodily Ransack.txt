[Music: Avulsed '92]
[Lyrics: Avulsed]

Dark Suburbs Of Misery
Where People Crawls On The Dirt
Territory Of Violent Hunts
And Commerce With Human Beings

[Chorus:]
I Can Hear The Cry
Of Dying Human Mice
Innocent Preys
Of A Morbid Trade

Killed In The Most Brutal Way
By Surgeons Trained To Slay
Mutilated, Hung On A Meat Hook
Frozen Limbs To Avoid Decay

[Chorus:]
I Can Hear The Cry
Of Dying Human Mice
Innocent Preys
Of A Morbid Trade

Dissapeared - Shattered Lifes
Body Snatching - Organs For Sale
Occult Business - Dealing With Corpses
Abducting People - Massacring Them

Used In Experimentation
Bloody Useless Vivisections
Scientifical Immolation
Cadavers For Weird Dissections

Assasinated - Horrible Deaths
Eviscerated - Ablated Entrails
Torns To Pieces - Shredded Limbs
Exterminated - No One Cares

Covering
Organs Demand
Killing The Poorest
Rich Shall Survive

Selling And Buying
Corporal Parts
Macabre Black Market
Bodily Ransack

Buried Into Massive Graves
A Vast Pile Of Carbonized Remains
Millions Of Crimes Are Being Ignored
Forgotten Corpses Rot Away

[Chorus:]
I Can Hear The Cry
Of Dying Human Mice
Innocent Preys
Of A Morbid Trade
