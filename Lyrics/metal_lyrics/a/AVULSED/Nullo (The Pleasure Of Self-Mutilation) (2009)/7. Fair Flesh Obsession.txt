Abducted to feed
The sickened need
Kept in chains
To unable the escape

Hosed with blood
To attract the beast
The thing that lives
Deep down beneath

Fair flesh obsession
My sickened twin
That burst out from within
Fair flesh obsession
This beast inside will never die

I keep it tied
In the cellar it lives
I keep it hidden
Roaming the catacombs
I keep it fed
Living subjects abducted
I keep it calmed
To then wind up dead

Deep down in the lair
Where it lives and dwells
I must feed it with victims
And dispose of their remains

Abducted to feed
The sickened need
Kept in chains
To unable the escape

Hosed with blood
To attract the beast
The thing that lives
Deep down beneath

Fair flesh obsession
My sickened twin
That burst out from within
Fair flesh obsession
This beast inside will never die
