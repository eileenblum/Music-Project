Deranged mind, a life of crime
It's time to die in a supreme way

Reaping lives after demise
Requires a fine tactic of suicide

Ingesting a toxic brew in lethal dose
A studied mix to fermentate in stomach
The rotting cocktail will emanate a deadly gas
Once dissected in autopsy's procedure

Killing after death [x4]

Lying on the stretcher
Before the rigor mortis
The corpse is still brewing
And getting ready to erupt

Scalpel down!

The Abdomen
Is fully bloated
First incision
Unleashes the gas
The three doctors
Lying on the floor
Gaseated
The masterpiece is done!
