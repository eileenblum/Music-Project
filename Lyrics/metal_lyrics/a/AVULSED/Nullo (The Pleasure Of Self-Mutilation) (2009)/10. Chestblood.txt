Blood on my chest
On your chest blood
Lets join our chestblood!

Inner morbid feelings
Haemophilic passion
Vulnerable desire
Juicy deep red drops

Blood on my chest
On your chest blood
Lets join our chestblood!

Tearing the flesh with a knife
Quickly bleeding wounds
Mixing fluids with lust
Chest to chest, bloon on blood

Cut the flesh, lick the wound
Take the pain, taste the flesh
Drink it pure, lick it slow
Tear the flesh, let it go

Embrace the knife with your chest
Mix the blood, taste the rest
Fuck it deep, give it more
Squeeze the drops, on the floor

Blood on my chest
On your chest blood
Lets join our chestblood!
