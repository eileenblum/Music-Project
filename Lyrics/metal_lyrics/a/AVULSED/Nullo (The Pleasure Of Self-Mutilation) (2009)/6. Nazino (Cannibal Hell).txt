Trying to get rid of
Unsuitable population
Cleaning the streets
From the biggest cities

Deporting the masses
In ships way up the river
Confining them in an island
Without food or shelter

Nazino -- The island of Death
Nazino -- Siberian nightmare
Nazino -- Eat or be eaten
Nazino -- A cannibal hell

Below zero -- Emaciated
Dozens dying -- Every day

Nazino -- The island of Death
Nazino -- Siberian nightmare
Nazino -- Eat or be eaten
Nazino -- A cannibal hell

Guards shooting -- No escape
Corpses lying -- Everywhere

Perishing by famine
Later dysentery
And typhold
Did the rest
Feasting on their corpses
Was the only way
To get some decent food
To survive

Deporting the masses
In ships way up the river
Confining them in an island
Without food or shelter

Below zero -- Emaciated
Dozens dying -- Every day
