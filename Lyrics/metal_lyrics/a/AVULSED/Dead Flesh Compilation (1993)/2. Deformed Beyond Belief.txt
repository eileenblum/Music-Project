Trying To Reach Beautifulness By (Plastic) Surgery
Never Mind The Suffering That You Could Feel
The Price Of Things You Wish Is Too High
You Will Pay Your Greediness With Your Life

[Chorus 1:]
Your Body Pierced By Hooks And Pins
Slowly Tighten Your Soften Skin
Forcing To Limit Pain Is Extreme

Snipping Off Your Sinews, Dislocating Limbs
Thorax Is Broken By Fractured Ribs
Extremities Disarticulated
Members Stretched To Be Amputated

[Chorus 2:]
Dying Screams,
You Are Being Deformed
Deformed Beyond Belief
Turning Your Body Into
A Shapeless Mass Of Limbs
Traumatic Mutations, You Are...
Deformed Beyond Belief

Grotesque Monument To Deformity
Performed With The Corpses Of Human Beings
Flesh, Bones, Intestines, Skin And Veins
Mixed-Up Into A Twisted Pile Of Bloody Meat

Artistic Lacerations
Sculpture Of Remains
Perfect Excoriations
Erasing Your Face

Horrid, Faceless,
Deformed Beyond Belief

Gloomy Abominations
From The Sickest Mind
Macabre Obsession
Beauty To Grind

Twisted, Limbless,
Deformed Beyond Belief

[Chorus 1:]
Your Body Pierced By Hooks And Pins
Slowly Tighten Your Soften Skin
Forcing To Limit Pain Is Extreme

When Cranium Is Crushed By The Hatchet
Eyes Fly Ejected Out Of Their Sockets
Skull Is Impaled In Your Spine
Flesh Of The Torso Carved With The Knife

[Chorus 2:]
Dying Screams,
You Are Being Deformed
Deformed Beyond Belief
Turning Your Body Into
A Shapeless Mass Of Limbs
Traumatic Mutations, You Are...
Deformed Beyond Belief
