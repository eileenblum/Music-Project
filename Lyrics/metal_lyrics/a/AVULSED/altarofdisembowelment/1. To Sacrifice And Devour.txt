To be devoured and fed upon
To be the one that gives the flesh

A human heap of rotting chowder
For the monstrosity to gorge on
Strapped down and awaiting pain
To be ripped and ghastly severed

To sacrifice and devour [2x]

Slashed into pieces by the hands
Ripped asunder by tentacles
Skin shredded and flayed mounted as a warning
Eaten by obscenity devoured by putridity

To sacrifice and devour [2x]

This forest deep
Where humans are displayed
Trees covered in skin
The way to ritual grounds
Sacrificial devourment
Now begging the descent
Into depravity
Devoured by the filth

To sacrifice and devour [2x]
A human heap of rotting chowder
For the monstrosity to gorge on
Strapped down and awaiting pain
To be ripped and ghastly severed

To sacrifice and devour [2x]
