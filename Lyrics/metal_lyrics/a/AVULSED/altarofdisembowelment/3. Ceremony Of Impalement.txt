The stakes erected awaiting
The night slowly creeps upon you
The ritualistic feasts
Has now arrived to this place

To awaken that which sleeps
Deep below the ritual grounds
As the blood will drip down
The feeding will begin

Ceremony of impalement [2x]

Drive the stakes into the flesh
The fluids of life
Slowly pour into the filth
To conjure the hell bent

Ceremony of impalement [4x]

Release... The human scent
Drench... The dirt in blood
Fire up the stakes
Burn the remains of the ritual
Ashes will rain down
To feed the sickness that dwells here

The stakes erected awaiting
The night slowly creeps upon you
The ritualistic feasts
Has now arrived to this place

To awaken that which sleeps
Deep below the ritual grounds
As the blood will drip down
The feeding will begin

Ceremony of impalement [4x]
