Serrated blade of maliciousness
Slowly thrusted downwards
Slivering sounds of utter pain
Ending in a nocturnal scream

Orgiastic releases forth
As the initiated squirm
Feeding from their own creed
Worshippers of the foul

A gathering of the travellers
Those who frequent the darkened massed
A collection of mist dwellers
Called together to expel pure blood

Tremble in the darkness
Chosen to give the fluid
To evoke what thrives afar
Awaiting to be summoned

Tremble in the darkness
Now bleeding out a vortex
Slowly the ground is breathing 
Licking the red gleaming drippings

Tremble in the darkness
They shall bleed
Tremble in the darkness
A vile sacrifice
