[Music: Furni / Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

The passion for cannibalism was their mutual like
Two twin souls that found a common way
They got married with the aim of procreating
Countless children to satisfy their needs

Severed child sawn in two 
Its micro-brain for a mousse
Its extremities are like hot-wings
Its intestines are for croquettes

They had to beget a new child every six months
Time enough to get a new tasty foetus
In the meantime they had to feed themselves like normal humans
But every six months they had a gourmet foetus dinner

Unstoppable yearning
Carnivorous lust
Infanticidal instincts
Foetivorous marriage

Severed child sawn in two 
Its micro-brain for a mousse
Its extremities are like hot-wings
Its intestines are for croquettes

Toasty foetus on a grill of salty crispy texture
Delicious tender meat from the ribs, tex-mex styled
There was not too much meat on such a small creature
But as always good things, if brief, twice as good

In their behaviours there couldnt be any criminal act
Since nobody would ever know she was pregnant

Unstoppable yearning
Carnivorous lust
Infanticidal instincts
Foetivorous marriage
