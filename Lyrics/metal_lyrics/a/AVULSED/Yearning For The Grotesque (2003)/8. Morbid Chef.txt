[Music: Tana / Lyrics: Dave Rotten / Guest Vocals: Bjoern Goosses]

Chef in a restaurant
O f the highest class
Refined gourmet

He was responsible
Of choosing the food
They had to use

He had a special secret related to meat
He personally was taking care of it

The restaurant was famous for its meat
People came just to eat its steak tartar
Nobody knew the special touch that this chef
Was putting on to achieve such a flavour

Meat balls, muffled brain, sirloin in sauce, human kebab
Marinaded ribs, hamburgers, bilis cream, tongue stew

Sadistic mind, perverse menu, morbid chef

The more people ate
The more often they returned
And they didnt know why

It was so delicious
That it was really worth
To pay any amount

Human meat is an addictive drug
Once youve eaten a bit you wont resist anymore

[Guitar solo: Juancar]

Meat balls, muffled brain, sirloin in sauce, human kebab
Marinaded ribs, hamburgers, bilis cream, tongue stew

Sadistic mind, perverse menu, morbid chef
