[Music: Juancar / Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

Entering the cemetery like a furtive hunter
Hiding in the shadows where nobody can see me
Stalking out the tombs, the most recent ones
The smell of fresh cadavers helps me on my search

Digging six feet under, working over night
Waiting for a treasure made of flesh and bones
Atrocious desire for decaying corpses
Necrocannibalistic feast right before the dawn

Carrion is my delight
Putrid reek i enjoy
Devourer of the dead
Devourer of the dead

Coagulated blood, i masticate
Livid sweet eyeballs are my fave
Red meat from the knees, of godly taste
Rotting genitals, what i eat last

Hacking up the rests to bring them home
There shall be no remains left for the worms

[Guitar solo: Oliver Phillips]

Hacking up the rests to bring them home
There shall be no remains left for the worms

Coagulated blood, i masticate
Livid sweet eyeballs are my fave
Red meat of the knees, of godly taste
Rotting genitals, what i eat last

Carrion is my delight
Putrid reek i enjoy
Devourer of the dead
Devourer of the dead

Digging six feet under, working over night
Waiting for a treasure made of flesh and bones
Atrocious desire for decaying corpses
Necrocannibalistic feast right before the dawn
