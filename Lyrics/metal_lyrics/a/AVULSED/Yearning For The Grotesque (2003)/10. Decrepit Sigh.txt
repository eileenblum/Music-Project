[Music: Furni/Cabra / Lyrics: Dave Rotten]

Darkness surrounds me
In my sorrowful agony
I feel my death is near
And its corroding my mind

Tormented thoughts
Invades my head
The final day has come to me
I just have to wait
Laid down on my bed waiting
For my final breath
I have no strength to control
My dismal thoughts of demise

Certain death
Dark decay
In peace i die
Slowly i rot

My body is passing away
But my soul still remains
It is just longing for
My last decrepit sigh

Tormented thoughts
Invades my head
The final day has come to me
I just have to wait
Laid down on my bed waiting
For my final breath
I have no strength to control
My dismal thoughts of demise

Certain death
Dark decay
In peace i die
Slowly i rot

My body is passing away
But my soul still remains
It is just longing for
My last decrepit sigh

[Guitar solo: Cabra]
