[Music: Furni / Lyrics: Dave Rotten / Guest Vocals: Bjoern Goosses]

When mommy died the family had to continue
Years passed and daddy got a hot new girlfriend
The two sons were not satisfied with the situation
Life at home was getting tensed and unbearable

The poor girl was a victim
The brothers were tracing a plan to make her life a hell
Submitting her to a psychic torture
Until her nerves could not resist and get her leaving home

And they did succeed; her nerves exploded
But not the way they wanted her to
Then she became a twisted psychopath
Thinking of a way to make them pay

Cooking a daddy stew

To celebrate their dads birthday she stabbed him
One stab for each year he has lived, namely fourty four
She cut his body off into countless bits and made a stew
Then she served it to the two brothers who ate it well

The poor girl was a victim
The brothers were tracing a plan to make her life a hell
Submitting her to a psychic torture
Until her nerves could not resist and get her leaving home

And they did succeed; her nerves exploded
But not the way they wanted her to
Then she became a twisted psychopath
Thinking of a way to make them pay

And they did succeed; her nerves exploded
But not the way they wanted her to
Then she became a twisted psychopath
Thinking of a way to make them pay

Cooking a daddy stew
