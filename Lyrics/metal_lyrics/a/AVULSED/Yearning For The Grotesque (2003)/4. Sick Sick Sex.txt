[Music: Furni / Lyrics: Dave Rotten)]

Ive always been a quiet guy
An introverted personality
Never had a really close friend
Im difficult to deal with

Because of this my sexuality
Has always been an utopia
But in my inner self
I felt uncontrollable desires

I want sex!!
At any cost!!
Penetrating a cadaver
Right after disembowelment
Still feeling her warmy blood
In contrast to her cold skin

Embracing that inert body
Feasting on entrails
Sodomizing all her cavities
Pure gore insanity

Sick sick sex... Sick!!!!!!!!!

Because of this my sexuality
Has always been an utopia
But in my inner self
Felt uncontrollable desires

I want sex!!
At any cost!!
Penetrating a cadaver
Right after disembowelment
Still feeling her warmy blood
In contrast to her cold skin

Embracing that inert body
Feasting on entrails
Sodomizing all her cavities
Pure gore insanity

Sick sick sex... Sick!!!!!!!!!!
