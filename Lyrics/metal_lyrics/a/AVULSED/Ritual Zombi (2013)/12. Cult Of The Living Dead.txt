This is nothing new, adoration of idols
Millenary habits, as old as humans
Powerful beings, almighty forces
Legends and myths, even gods and stars

But poor Christians, decided to believe
A lousy human, a crazy liar
Not powerful, not almighty
Not a legend or myth, just a poor mortal

Cult of the living dead!! [4x]

Heâs not dead.... heâs a fucking zombie!! [2x]

Worshipping a corpse, a fucking walking dead
Rotting and stinky, a soulless entity
Spreading lies in life, bullshit utopias
Something proven wrong, two thousand years later

Taking advantage of poor weak ignorant
Without any hope, leeching their minds
Offering paradise, after theyâre dead
Then theyâll meet, their beloved holy zombie

Cult of the living dead!! [4x]

Heâs not dead.... heâs a fucking zombie!
