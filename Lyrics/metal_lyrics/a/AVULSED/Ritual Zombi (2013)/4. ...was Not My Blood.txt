Weird feelings, too much hot, unbearable
Sweat dripping, in the night, open windows
Was a nightmare but looked so real
I remember perfectly what happened

Was not my blood
All over my chest
In my hands
In my mouth
[2x]

I was running on the streets persecuted
Hordes of zombies moving fast they caught me

Was not my blood
All over my chest
In my hands
In my mouth
[2x]

Disemboweling my entrails
Dismembering my arms and legs
Absorbing my body fluids
Masticating my bloody corpse

Ripping, Eating, Gulping, my flesh [2x]

Disemboweling my entrails
Dismembering my arms and legs
Absorbing my body fluids
Masticating my bloody corpse

Suffocated, I woke up, it was over
Just a nightmare, went to toilet, to wash my face

But then I saw all that blood
Dripping from my hands
Chunks of flesh on my mouth
Stench of death in the air
I looked back over my bed
My wifeâs corpse was there
It was totally devoured
What kind of nightmare was this?

Disemboweled her entrails
Dismembered her arms and legs
Absorbed her body fluids
Masticated her bloody corpse
