Never eat meat, nothing that was
previously alive or coming from it

Where have you seen a living dead guy
still with principles even after death

His conscience was so fucking deep
that he couldnât feed of human meat
like any other typical zombie
He would devour just human vegans

Cannivegan Corpse [3x]

Feeding on vegan meat, was not a sin
That kind of protein, is unadultered
This is the nearest way, to keep veganism
On this hard state, where one has to eat human flesh
