As soon as the day has died
awakens flesh equally dead
the hunt is on once again
I need to eat your head

We move in herds to kill
run you down like prey
nothing you squeal will help
so be quiet as you die

Bleeding away
just like the sour rain
dying into undeath
submerged in utter pain

Dead Flesh Awakened [2x]

As soon as the day has died
awakens flesh equally dead
the hunt is on once again
I need to eat your head

We move in herds to kill
run you down like prey
nothing you squeal will help
so be quiet as you die

I do not want
to go this way
please let me die
instead of being dead alive

Dead Flesh Awakened [2x]
