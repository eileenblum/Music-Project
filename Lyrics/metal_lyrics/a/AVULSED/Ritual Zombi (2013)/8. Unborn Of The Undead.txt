Several months ago, the seed of life
Was planted on a fertile girl
A happy couple, just married
Future looked bright, for both of them

A weird disease, spread all over
No human survived, all were infected
Nobody died, nobody lived
Still moving corpses, theyâre all undead

Their brains are dead, so they canât think
Basic instincts, rule their bodies
They just canât feed, only devour

The pregnant girl, kept growing on
Her abdomen, was undead
A little dead baby, was just unborn

Unborn of the Undead [4x]

Unborn of the Undead [2x]

A weird disease, spread all over
No human survived, all were infected
Nobody died, nobody lived
Still moving corpses, theyâre all undead

Their brains are dead, so they canât think
Basic instincts, rule their bodies

The pregnant girl, kept growing on
Her abdomen, was undead
A little dead baby, was just unborn
