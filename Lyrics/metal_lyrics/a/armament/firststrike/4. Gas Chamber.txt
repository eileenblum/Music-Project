A cry of pain leads to your death
You want to run but your strapped to the bend
The needles piercing and you start to burn
Death is slow as your saviours run

Slow death seeps into boiling veins
The life savings drops are the cause of pain
You cannot hide you cannot scream
The hit is on and let the terror begin

The dream of living unwary of doom
You wake to nightmare that comes too soon
Choke on your last wish your eyes start to burn
You cannot breath you cannot run

Your cries for help goes to deafening ears
Corrupted monsters will lick your fears
Infection spreads to thickened veins
The dead city sighs as tyranny reigns

Gas chamber

You cant outrun the poison fumes
Now watch it slowly extinguish you
Nowhere to run nowhere to move
You know your death has come too soon

Burning hell fed by monstrous greed
The city bleeds in corruptions need
A violent death to ease your pain
Tied to machines heaven turn to Hell
