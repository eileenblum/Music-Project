A stalker in the darkest shadows
Waiting for you in the night
A man who knows no mercy
Donât know whatâs wrong or right
has no friend, has no foe
is no myth, no fraud
serves the ideal of absolute justice
He is the Hammer of God
Hammer of God

No one to come, and help you out
No one to hear your screams
You find no place when you sleep
Heâll hunt you in your dreams
One without fear in his mortal eyes
Heâll stab you in the fog
No one can hide beyond his reach
He is the Hammer of Godâ¦
Hammer of God

You have tried to hide your fear act like as if you donât care
the fear wontâ ever go away for you know he is always there
A man chosen for unmatched faith his faith to make him blind
A killer without any guilt or doubt a weapon of justice divine

A stalker in the darkest shadows
Waiting for you in the night
A man who knows no mercy
Donât know whatâs wrong or right
has no friend, has no foe
is no myth, no fraud
serves the ideal of absolute justice
He is the Hammer of God
Hammer of God

Will not stop till the scales are leveled
With your blood and tears
make you scream, and welcome death
find your hidden fears
wonât be moved, when you beg for mercy
Your life rests in his hands
wonât hesitate, as he seals your fate
Heâll kill you where you standâ¦
