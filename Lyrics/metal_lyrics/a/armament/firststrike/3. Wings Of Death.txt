Down you came from your enemy's six
Down you came from the sun
Two had entered this deadly dance
Survival only for one
Your enemies cut left and right
Trying to outrun his death
The bullets trace close to your wings
Trying to catch your breath

No time to think bout those you kill
Do what you must to survive
Flying high on your wings of death
Is when you feel alive

All at once your enemies turn
And head in for the sun
No choice to leave but to follow
You have him on the run
You thought this battle was the end
But there is only last trick to be played
As you hear your engine roaring sick
You know now you have failed

Suddenly the skies grow dark
A shadow hides the sun
You hear the sound of wicked death
Raining down from the blazing guns

Wings of death
