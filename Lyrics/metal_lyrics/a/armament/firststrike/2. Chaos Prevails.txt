Religious nuisance and a thousand lies
Suffer till you break by their by code
Preaching their dogma a hatred rife
Sabotage you to their whim
Holy law are wretched sins
Sins you have paid to forgive
Living awake, a scream till death
Pay the price to the Heaven's gate

Martyr scream no one will hear
The rush for all political powers
They seize the day money and women
A fairy tale chaotics exhibition
Powers that will buy and sell
For heinous legal vengeance
They come for you in the midnight hour
Burning homes in the city of your dreams

Spectators drunk from the yield of justice
You witness the mockery of law
The hammer smashed on innocent victims
Only for sanitary pleasant
Mothers raped as children watch
Money for primetime media
Acid bath is your only solution
Chemical sex for the plastic dolls

Cold blooded experience to the face of truth
Flesh and skins is all that left
An ideal fuck to your pathetic life
Sex starved pigs will squeal
Advertising niceties and heavenly feels
Monetary satisfaction
They have legal extortion schemes
Yet in this city of chaos... Prevails

Tormented you feel your blood running cold
Anger is all that you feel
All that is left to believe
And to fight

Chaos will blind your eyes
Magical dream of this goddess wrath
Chaos in this systemic disease
To blind your soul from the wheel of death

Chaos in this city of joy
Evil grasps the people in fear
Chaos is the only truth
To make you dance to the music of pain

Midnight's army marches on
Search for your battered paradise
Death's hunger won't satisfy
A judgement for a thousand dead

Tormented you feel your blood running cold
Anger is all that you feel
All that is left to believe
And to fight you want
No one is here your only hope
Now it's all vague
Power drains consciousness
Chaos prevails
