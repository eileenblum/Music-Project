Light is crowd today,
And the sea is calmedâ¦

Your face is white, as your clothes.
Your lips are greyâ¦

I catch your hand today,
To put my ringâ¦

You smile and cry and shutâ¦
For what you wonât gotâ¦

A candle is lit tonight,
Your lips turned off tonightâ¦
Music is playing for us,
A wedding for me a requiem for youâ¦

Youâll always be mine in my heartâ¦
Waiting to expire in my mindâ¦

Give one last kiss, before die,
Caress my hands, for once againâ¦
Let me carry you in my armsâ¦
Oh, forget it fool. Sheâs gone!

Night is crowd tonight,
And the sea is outâ¦
You canât smile and cry, only shutâ¦
For what we wonât gotâ¦
