[a. There is only one season in the sky.]

I donât know if I seek solitudeâ¦
Or if Iâll find it when I turn back.

Each winter is colder than before,
And each summer is shorter than winterâ¦
I wonder where autumn has gone,
Itâs on the street of the largest city (in a grey universe)â¦

Iâve never felt such cold.
Iâve never slept such long. In me, something is gone.
Left way was the rightâ¦ (Iâm lost again).
Iâve never felt such cold.
Iâve never slept such long. In me, something is gone.

[b. It lays over the leaves.]

Never be comfortable, never, in my pathway, but I knowâ¦
Surrounded by the edge, I can see the way, sometimesâ¦
But I am getting old, for walking on, and scars on feet donât cureâ¦

Look at the autumn now, itâs born and dead each dayâ¦
Donât try to catch it, itâs on the end of the endâ¦
Waiting the call, our mother, waiting for what is left,
on the street of the largest city in a grey universeâ¦

I will have to jump till my bones breakâ¦
Like little nails of this old woodâ¦
Thereâs only one thing I can doâ¦
Trying to sleep till sun doesnât riseâ¦

[c. You left it but there is no end.]

I donât really know where are my shoes now,
I simply try not to think in the end of my wayâ¦

What people feel for one, they only knowâ¦
So let them ask to their Godsâ¦

You betrayed the autumn now, you will feel as you were dead,
So donât ask me how it was the end, just prepare to suffer in lifeâ¦
When you came to our bed, you laid beside me,
Now you fight against me, and I am not armed nowâ¦

Scratching time all the way, feeling me as if you were in lifeâ¦ on our ownâ¦
Believe me, youâre died, weâre free for flying seas aloneâ¦ on our ownâ¦
Come close, feel trust, and forget meâ¦ as you felt once lifeâ¦ on our ownâ¦
youâve goneâ¦

Screaming tears. All I can cryâ¦
Just facing years without dreams to playâ¦
Sleeping fears. Now I canât fightâ¦
All my gifts lay over trashâ¦
