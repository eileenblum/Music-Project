Die. Close your eyes and say goodbye.
Wake your mind in a shadow-life.
Youâll find yourself.
Leave all the treasures you shared with me.
I will remember but you donât.
We both are strange.

Dive, through that mood that I canât see.
Tell me how I can believe,
If you are a shade (nowâ¦)

Burn for me now. I should save myself.
Iâll never comprehend whatâs heaven and hell
Burn yourself now. You should save my soul
Iâll never comprehend whatâs me and youâ¦

Look whatâs left of me here
How I am getting oldâ¦
And my circle goes to endâ¦(and yours starts againâ¦)

Cold in this roomâ¦ God! How I know this songâ¦
Worms ate your soulâ¦ and I stay smoking your cigarettesâ¦

Lie. Say that life is something real.
Someplace where you can exist,
Without absurdâ¦
