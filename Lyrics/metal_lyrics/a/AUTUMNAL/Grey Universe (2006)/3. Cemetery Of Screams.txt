Where are you when I dream,
When do you cry where I lay...

Where are you while I ainât,
When I fainted you were in me....
When I closed my eyes you criedâ¦
Donât forget me if I dieâ¦

Over the horizons I see your cheatingâ¦now,
Come close and die with meâ¦ I see you have another oneâ¦

Pray for me there but I am not six feet, I can watch all you kiss and lay with â¦

Fear for your shelter; I am closeâ¦
See your new heart bleeding; I am the one..

Tears on my grave; But youâre goneâ¦
I will kill your new worlds; I am the oneâ¦

Pray for me there but I am not six feet, I can watch all you kiss and lay withâ¦

Over the horizons I can see your loveâ¦ now,
Go out and forget meâ¦ I see you have another oneâ¦

Where were you when I sleptâ¦
If you sleep now, I can restâ¦
