How many tears left to cry?
How many useless fights weâll waste...
...for them we want, we love...

Our feelings are immortal,
Our acts leaded by hate...

Now I feel sick, all those lies...
Strangle my last breath
I got happiness; with my hands I smashed it

I canât live life I choose...

Freedom falls over my shoulders, I try to change
But my evil wins, I shatter everything I touch...
