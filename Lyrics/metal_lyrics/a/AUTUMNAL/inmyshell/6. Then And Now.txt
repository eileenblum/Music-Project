Looking to past, I see passions are fresh
We are one, as naive as blind

Now I find my eyes filled with wrath (I hate even myself)
Leaves dropped by the wind of isolation

I try to fly again...
But my wings own you...
Observe whatâs left of me...
I am the body of hate...

I feel as none how I am a sinner. My fault was to love them as now I hate myself...

All that we fight for have gone
Now that our bodies come apart
How should I stop this hell burns my eyes
It burns all that we were...
I promise you Iâll find our way... (Again)
So I need my wings to fly... (Again)
I will stay in your place... (Again)
I need to feel our own... (Again)â¦
