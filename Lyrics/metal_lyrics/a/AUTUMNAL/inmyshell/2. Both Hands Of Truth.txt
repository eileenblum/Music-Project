Praying for nothing...
Living in and fighting for vanity...

I close my eyes and see through yours...
Burning inside, sunk in yourself, in your own truth.
Take my mind and feel what Iâve felt...

You are still blind, trapped by certainty...
Why donât you leave your ship?
...diving alone in your sea of truth...

I was a boy... and my reality...
You were a soul... and your light... life...
Hostile life...Two faces... two fronts...
Two hands... both as right... both as wrong...

Donât blame me if I hate the way you are,
it was my solitude, it comes from you...
I try to root out a word (from you), but you leave me... and down...
I know I failed... you know you failed...

Two faces... two fronts...
Two hands... both as right... both as wrong...
