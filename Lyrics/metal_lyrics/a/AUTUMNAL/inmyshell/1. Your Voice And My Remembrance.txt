Iâve heard your voice,
from water, it looked at me.
I couldnât recognize the call,
I was fearing to feel...

But I am here beside you,
while water hauls you.
Love is a satyr in your bed,
it awakes too soon and leaves you cold...

Why did you lie to me?
Now I tremble since youâve gone.
I have frozen your breath on my lips.
From my heart, I damn you for flying...

This pain I feel will never scar...

They could blind or mutilate me...
...and my body would ache...
Maybe they could kill me...
...but theyâd never heal my wounds,
good times with you...

Now that I am alone, I will go on for you...
