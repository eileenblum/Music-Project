Whereâs that child who smiled?
I canât recall him yet.
Whereâs that white sun that lit his face?
It doesnât warm me up now.

Timeâs left and all I think to see...
Now I know itâs left, I am alone here.
His face stamped in my mirror...
Last remains of his illusion. 

I am a new body, and new is my mind.
I ate the fruit of knowledge and now... freedom oppresses me.
This dream returns each day... each life.
What do you want from me...? I ainât here...

All our lifeâs a dune, and weâve approached the crest.
How long Iâll take to hit the ground...?
Why do we go on if we know where we stop...?
Carry me up with you to where something is immortal...

And I wonder when I changed my face,
When my chrysalis eclosioned...
You must have advised me,
You  must have avoided it...
Now I destroy in my path, unable to feel, not like before...

The love you spent made me a man
Gave me the wrath and the cruelty...
I embarked on a bigoted way
Made me who I ainât.
