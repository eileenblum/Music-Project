Am I alone...? Or is it the hollow...?
My play with vacuum nothing blows my ears.
I am nude...
(I awake and my bed is cold,
really? Am I alone...? 
Damage I create is for my solitude,
I wake too far...
Nightmare is innervated, trapped in your stalk,
a past life remains...
The forsaken trace of a traveler without shade
withdraws, rowing drift, sunk in this empty life...
my life with you...
Blood will always be blood, and the tears will flow
across my temples. The naked feet soaked with bile
with treated ground...
...as the kiss closed my eyelids...
All that we wept is in their minds
who survived us...
Can you tell me when was our end?
Can you signal where I am...?
