Our journey in earth will be in vain.
Our children we leave will be in vain.
Acteurs in their play, links of a chain. 
All that I had have gone
as you leave me now.
I remember so much loses in life.
But I know what I have will escape
will fade away because nothing lasts 
forever...I trapped in time,
I see you pass
behind my eyes.
Your wings blind me
your lightness... you slide into my veins.
Life has cold hands, and yours froze my heart.
The wind will carry the words, the river will drag the tears along, 
Fly from my arms,
IÂ´ll die alone as my birth
