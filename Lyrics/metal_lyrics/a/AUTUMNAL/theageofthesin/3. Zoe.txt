As I feel you as close as I couldnât dream,
I have fallen again on your spiderâs web,
My hands are guided by your threads,
Teach me now. You are heaven sent...

I have approached to you and you have removed my soul, 
Now it seems your heart turned to stone,
I was alone, drinking on my own, 
You looked behind and tied my soul,
All the visions that I had were lost,
You changed, you cleared my eyesâ¦

I turn off the radio and your voice sounds stillâ¦
You left my brain, I left your heartâ¦
I wish you were in, you wish I was outâ¦
Two years only on stage, autumn blown your smellâ¦
I blew and your clouds went goneâ¦

As I felt you as close as I couldnât dream,
Now I have no faith in having you again,
My lips are as dried as dead,
Only you can turn them wet...

I am in front of you and you canât see me,
There is a confussion wall between us...
I am inside of you and you canât feel me,
There is a fear shroud between you and me...

I tear down that shroud but you canât still see me,
There is something more between us...
I turn down the wall but you canât still feel me,
Thereâs something there beside you... but not me...

Colour of my bed is red, your lips have turn grey,
I know I put you into a death, but this is what I am... Death.
