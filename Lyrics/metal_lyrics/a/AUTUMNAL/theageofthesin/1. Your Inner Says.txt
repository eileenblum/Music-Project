I close my eyes, you are beside me.
But I could awake alive if my eyes keep wide close.

I scream on your shell, your inner says you are there
So where is your answer, now you moved away...

I live too far to say âhelloâ...
So I awake and my eyes canât find your shade
Come and warm my soul, to catch the sun I need to cut this rope...

I scream on your shell, your inner says you are there
So where is your answer, now you moved away...

Itâs like a razorâs edge. Yesterday I fell to looserâs side.
Now I spit to what I loved before. Thatâs how it better aches.
And itâs better to smell shit alone than hearing laughs. 

Save me from here. I donât know how to escape. I am empty.
What the hell! If everything is a bear in a matchbox...
