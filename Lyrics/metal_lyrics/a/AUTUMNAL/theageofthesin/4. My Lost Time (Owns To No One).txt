Now that I am lost,
with you diving through the past.
Now that I canât regret,
world runs deep into my head.

I canât save my soul,
and silence spoke so loud...
You canât save my soul,
and time owns to no one...

Now that you arenât here
I see the fault, see the truth.
Now that the heart is iced
the ice reminds me the heat of you.

I canât save my soul,
and silence spoke so loud...
You canât save my soul,
and time owns to no one...

There is no way to turn back,
All has passed by...
All the tears we cried,
All of them have gone byâ¦
Now I pray for living here,
In a place where nobody is inâ¦
Thanks God,
There is no Godâ¦

Look at it, in front of your eyes.
You canât see me cause I ainât
I moved awayâ¦

A cryingâ¦at bottom, I am to blame.
My madness is flowing againâ¦once againâ¦
Happiness on my back is for othersâ¦
All ends the sameâ¦all begins the sameâ¦
A birthâ¦ a deathâ¦

And let the flower shine,
Its dew wonât be backâ¦
The more you cry,
The more the bee will flyâ¦
