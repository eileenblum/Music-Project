A shy bird over a treeâ¦
A black crow dismembering himâ¦
A child playing with stonesâ¦ 
And a train smashing his bonesâ¦
How can you cut this wire, 
If you only nail your knife?
Step by step you are destroying your kidsâ¦
Shoot and shoot them before they heal.

With hatred, now, you watch the grass growing old.
Follow me, my angel, but donât step where I fall.
A flash, a crash, waking up, my angel, cause it is time of deathâ¦

A white butterfly flies over these fieldsâ¦
A black cloud poisoning himâ¦
This rain under I roamâ¦
Is beginning to burn with its coldâ¦
How can you cut this wire,
If you only nail your knife?

With hatred, now, you watch the grass growing old.
Follow me, my angel, but donât step where I fall.
A flash, a crash, waking up, my angel, cause it is time of deathâ¦

Please, turn off these flames,
Scream all I am saying,  when these bodies are lostâ¦
For me, they rest in their graves,
Now all I can play is to learn to loveâ¦

Drink from me and donât you give them nowâ¦
Donât you throw it down because itâs all my fleshâ¦
Leave me, donât you look back homeâ¦
You must break their bones, now you are a Manâ¦
