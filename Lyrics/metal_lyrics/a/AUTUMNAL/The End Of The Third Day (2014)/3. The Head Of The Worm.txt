Now so much saliva, so little roleâ¦
So little time and too much to loseâ¦
Vinegar polished masksâ¦ 
And poison in the visceraâ¦
Puncture the skin of allâ¦
Have no bloodâ¦
And without that red inkâ¦
The future is in vainâ¦
Yesterday is not but the language to sufferâ¦
The jugular is opened in two holesâ¦
Through one the wine escapesâ¦
For other one the pleasureâ¦
For once I felt insideâ¦
I donât remember the reason ofâ¦ 
But I know I must doâ¦ I must do itâ¦
(For once I felt growing into your fieldsâ¦)

The useless fighting with my devilsâ¦
No more war to learnâ¦
As the mallows sleeps in my hairâ¦
In my disclosed chestâ¦

And even in the nails grows the hairâ¦
And even in the guts cuts the iceâ¦

I thought that I could finally bornâ¦
That I could deceive the oldnessâ¦
I begged not to have to return to winâ¦
At the head of the wormâ¦
Trying to drink meâ¦
Blackened mother one dayâ¦
I will own youâ¦
