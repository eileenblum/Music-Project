Time will come,
For you to understand,
The light is closer,
And I'll be there again.

You lift me above myself,
Blinded by this fury,
I propose and you dispose
While Death assumes his role.

The tremble of my soul,
Shows me I'm the exception,
Broken by your words,
Awaiting some kind of passion.

Lead me to your path,
Show me all is done.
Gone, in time.    
No one cares, and you falling down...

Lead me to your path,
Father's will erased,
I keep falling down...
