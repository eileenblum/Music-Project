I stood, I grabbed the bed,
with one hand and lifted itâ¦
above our heads, she fell,
 down from above the mattressâ¦

I hit the shelf and jumped
From the wall crashing into the groundâ¦
And scattering a dozen books,
She got up and left the roomâ¦

The storm remainsâ¦ The storm remainsâ¦
The storm remainsâ¦ The storm remainsâ¦  The sameâ¦

I embed a fist on the door,
And knuckles dug into the woodâ¦
I opened itâ¦  but she wouldnât be anymore.

The storm remainsâ¦ The storm remainsâ¦
The storm remainsâ¦ The storm remainsâ¦  The sameâ¦

I went back, I leaned against the wall, 
With the whole backâ¦
I slipped and fell to the ground,
Slowly, fetal pose, and I cried ...

The storm remainsâ¦ The storm remainsâ¦  The sameâ¦
