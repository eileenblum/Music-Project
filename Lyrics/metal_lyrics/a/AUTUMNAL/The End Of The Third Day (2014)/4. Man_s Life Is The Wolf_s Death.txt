I live all alone leaving minutes off
I wonât walk â¦ I travel thinking about
me changing something out of this, but
this exists before you and me swim in this mud.

But I am wrong again,
one in a million of solitudesâ¦
I canât climb my stairs,
Trapped by the heaviest maskâ¦
I wonât spread my chest,
Pumping between anger and lustâ¦
I pray The Lord to rest,
but my heart still beatsâ¦

I have become to feel so weird so 
far, so strange in this viscous lifeâ¦
Roots over me drowning, choking
Life, I must dry, fall and feed the grass before I burn.

But I am wrong againâ¦
I canât climb my stairsâ¦
I wonât spread my chestâ¦.
But my heart still beatsâ¦

Now, that I am all aloneâ¦ I know that Iâve always been, I will always beâ¦ I donât pretend otherwise.

I am getting old, and something I donât know
Sucks my sap, consumes my old smileâ¦
An immortal hell with demons that feed on dull years
A life, that is death, doesnât end if you donât breatheâ¦
I look back and the road seems so curved and rough, 
Before me all is straightâ¦.

I thrashed you, you loved meâ¦ but I owned my reasonâ¦
Over and overâ¦ I tried to concealâ¦.
What in me should be less than a simple fearâ¦
Older and colderâ¦ we just approach to fallâ¦
