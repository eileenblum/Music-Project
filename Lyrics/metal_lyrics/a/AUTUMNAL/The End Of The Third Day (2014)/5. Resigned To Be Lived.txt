Hey you, my loser son,
You see your sins if you are alone,
Would you need to walk on your own?

When there is no movement here,
The future seems to disappear
Wonât you ever feel the stringsâ¦ of love?

You wait and I am cold,
Frozen like a winter storm.
Do I really stay so lost?

I catch your generous smile,
While I hide along my trail
Turn down these walls Iâve builtâ¦ with bad bloodâ¦

I slide along these rails I drewâ¦ 
cause I fear my voice on youâ¦

I trust that my being will be safe in my old shellâ¦
Where the toll is so pricey that you cannot payâ¦
I would want to believe that this bad dream
Wasnât trueâ¦ but my mindâ¦ but my mindâ¦

I slide along these streets like meatâ¦
Crawling into a crusher meatâ¦
I cannot love anymoreâ¦ with threads severed
My figure sculpts behind the crossâ¦. Because now I loved it all.

I cannot buy to you the whole worldâ¦ there is nothing more meager
There is no greater contemptâ¦ because, now, I gave it all. 

I cannot drink from your cupâ¦ there is no only one
There is too much for three timesâ¦ because, now, now I choked.

Hey you, my useless sonâ¦
