Just one stepâ¦ one and three since I leftâ¦
All my skin is wrinkled like a used napkin,
An empty mapâ¦

One, one stepâ¦ one, and another one,
I cross this wet streetâ¦ listening this useless laugh 
In my neckâ¦ and in my feetâ¦

Over my eyes, all my sweat burns all my skin
My hair is on end, my head is exhaustedâ¦
My broken shoesâ¦

Here I stand, paralyzed, and I feel the time,
I cannot fightâ¦ It passed awayâ¦
And that whatâs left, for the rest of our lifeâ¦
(And here I standâ¦ almost paralyzed, for the rest of my lifeâ¦)

Just the same stepâ¦ one and a shit in my soleâ¦
From a dog she abandonedâ¦ eating from streetsâ¦
It has three feetâ¦

One, one stepâ¦ one, and another one,
I cross this wet streetâ¦ listening this useless laugh 
In my neckâ¦ and in my feetâ¦

Here I stand, paralyzed, and I feel the time,
I cannot fightâ¦ It passed awayâ¦ (in the otherâs mind)
And that whatâs left, for the rest of our lifeâ¦
(And here I standâ¦ almost paralyzed, for the rest of my lifeâ¦)

I am tired of changing shirtsâ¦ when it strangles meâ¦
I donât know how to release the neckâ¦
I am fed up with tearing shirtsâ¦ when I get rid of themâ¦
As if I was cutting the surface to breatheâ¦
I am furious forâ¦ the clouds go awayâ¦
I am counting full moonsâ¦ that it left me hereâ¦
Waiting for a mouth to mouthâ¦ of Luciferâ¦
I cannot catch the butterflyâ¦ to make her mineâ¦
I cannot flyâ¦ touching landâ¦
I cannot breathâ¦ the open airâ¦
There is a cloudâ¦ from bile smokeâ¦
It comes from your lips... your last cigarâ¦

Cockroaches go out to breathâ¦
When the smoke of her cigarâ¦
Already does not leave air insideâ¦
Like my dreamsâ¦	

Here I stand, paralyzed, and I feel the time,
I cannot fightâ¦ It passed awayâ¦ (in the otherâs mind)
And that whatâs left, for the rest of our lifeâ¦
(And here I standâ¦ almost paralyzed, for the rest of my lifeâ¦)
