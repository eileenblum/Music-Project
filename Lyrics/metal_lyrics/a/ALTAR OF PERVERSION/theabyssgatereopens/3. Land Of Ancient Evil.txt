In the cast ruinous land
laying remote unknown
the black stronghold raises itÂ´s walls
lonely in the vast forgotten swamp
a long moonless night
stretches its coil
malignant and silent
among pinnacles and spires

Titanic towers
nor time can destroy
idols of stone dominate still
cold delving eyes and horrible grins
upon altars of everlasting bloodstains

TempleÂ´s keepers of impious rites
and of cries that did lacerate the soul

Shadows rest in a fake sleep
the serpent lays waiting for his call
silence in the room of the black throne
fragile equilibrium old of millennia

Caves hide lost manuscripts
the secret of those
who dominate the void (hail to them)

The beast wanders
among dark alleys
seeking for the way
towards the external world
world upon which he did reign with no rival
world upon which he will reign in weeping and pain

[Music: Seth December 97, lyrics: Rexor 95]
