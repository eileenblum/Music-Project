I open this cold creaking gate
and enter as many a night before
funeral lamps guide my way
inside the small cemetery

The macabre surroundings arouse my lust
I look around me as if observed by dead eyes
no fear I am dead myself
the wind plays strange music inside here (not alone?)

Silent desecration
opened graves and smell of death
a young dead nun
rape her with delight
can you remind your useless existence?
with delight I observe your disappointed corpse(s)
take some souvenirs and leave

The macabre surroundings...

The chant of owls
the black figure with the scythe
presences noises was it only in my mind?
with nostalgy I recall...
