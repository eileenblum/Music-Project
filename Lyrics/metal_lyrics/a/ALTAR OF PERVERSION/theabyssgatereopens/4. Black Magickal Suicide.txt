Deep pleasure and pain
as I open the beautiful gate (wound)

Wine flows in my veins
blood through my throat
ritual suicide of the mind

Sacrificial dagger in my bloody hands
I offer myself to myself (demon)
my blood from the chalice I drink

Voices in the wind voices from the moon (die)
fascinated by the gate my blood as their key

Now they have bodies
perverted divinities inside dead flesh
unholy copulation bestial fascination
screaming goddesses of the night

Black candles accrued icon of Christ
desecrated with sperm and blood

It was a clad night when I died
and the moon cried for me
only her my beloved obsession

[Music and lyrics: Seth 93/97]
