This night all is forgotten
Myself I remove
Lost in a perfect nothing
To reborn pure

My soul is free
As I serve the Lord
Horned Infernal being
Who exists within of me

Oh uncanny moon
You enlighten my journey
And summon the wolves
To accompany me

My spirit walks
Away from holy perdition
Free in glorious Blasphemy
I was reborn

The brightest of the stars

From the height
Of my new being
I contemplate your weak white light
Dazzled by my Black and majestic one
In tenebrous silence

My spirit walks
Away from holy perdition
Free in glorious Blasphemy
I was reborn

Sad memories of the ancient times
Come to my mind in this still night
Pale moon console me, let me drink your astral juice
Bright stars of Dark Light, let me hear your chants
