My soul has burnt, with flames of hate
Disgusted by the smell
Of the nazarene corpse

Now only in the shadows
I act and exist
And my hatred is calm yet fiery contempt

See my misanthropic smile
One hides a thousand lies
Yes, my vow is to deceive

What Abysses do call me
Is in them the only wisdom?

I spit on the sorrow of your god
And on your futile lives
Even hate was a waste with you
No feelings are left now

Silence can only be
After the Chaos of destruction
That Chaos I call forth
Solitude can only be
After total death
That solitude I invoke

This blood to call the Dark
Seals my hatred into wisdom
As the moon gleams
Through a cold fog

Strenght and wisdom through darkness
Exalted in the splendours of Satanic life

A lifeless smile from the dark
Envisioning the coming silence
Enjoying the coming solitude

Forget the past,
Forget the future you fools!
They clash and create timeless void
That is your reign
Or the grave we've build for you
