For the longest time I let it get the best of me
For the longest time I let it get the best of me
The feelings of being a watcher stolen from my life
No motivation
âGrateful for salvationâ
Ripped from my mind
Like a child, I felt so lost
Not pulling my own weight
To the point of self-loathing
Not pulling my own weight
Feeling of disgust (feeling of disgust)

For the longest time I let it get the best of me

Under these circumstances
I present self-sacrifice
Holding on to what I know is true to me
Feeling of disgust
I will cast you out
In the name of Christ
Feeling of disgust
I will cast you out
In the name of Christ

I declare healing in the name of Christ
Demonâs holds, loosen binds
I will not be captured by these mortal lies
I will not be captured by these mortal ties

I declare healing in the name of Christ
Demonâs holds, loosen binds
I will not be captured by these mortal lies
I will not be captured by these mortal ties

For the longest time I let it get the best of me
For the longest time I let it get the best of me
