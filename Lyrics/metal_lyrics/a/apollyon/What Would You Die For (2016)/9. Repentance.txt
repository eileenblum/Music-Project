Who are you trying to fool?
Who are you trying to convince?
What is it inside of you that says âI cannot repentâ?
What kind of carnality in depths of sin says âNo, I hear the truth, but I refuse, I refuse, I refuse, I refuseâ?

The great sacri-
The great sacri-
The great sacri-
The great sacrifice
He made a sacrifice
With His own flesh
And return you mock Him
With your breath
You're all cowards
Won't you actually seek
I can sense you're terrified
By your trembling
Repent and turn to God
So that your sins may be wiped clean

Repentance
Repentance
This is the Lordâs call
Repentance
He has called this 
Repentance
This is the Lordâs call
Repentance
He has called this
Repentance
This is the Lordâs call
Repentance

Lift up your hands you ancient gates
Open up you ancient doors
And let the King of glory
Enter.
