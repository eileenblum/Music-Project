[feat. Andrew Hileman of I Am]This is the end of everything
This is revelation
This the end of everything
That I've held dear

This is the end of everything
That I've held dear
Standing on the sand of the sea
I saw the beast rise up
Having seven heads, ten horns and ten crowns
It's all lead up to this
This marks the apocalypse,
The mark of the beast is 666

He builds armies for the dragon
Armageddon 
Armageddon
Armageddon
Armageddon

The end of everything
This is the end of everything
