[feat. Kris Kilgore of Heretic]I saw the Lord sitting on a throne
High and lifted up
And the train of His robe filled the temple
Above it stood seraphim
Each one had six wings
With two he covered his face, 
With two he covered his feet, 
And with two wings he flew 
And one cried to another

Holy,
Is the Lord of hosts
Holy,
The whole earth,
Holy,
Is full of His glory

Then one of the seraphim flew to me
Having in his hands a burning coal
Behold, this has touched your lips
Your iniquity is taken away
And your sin has been purged away
Your sin has been purged away

Have mercy on me
Oh, God
Oh, merciful Lord
Cleanse me through the blood of your son
Against the only have I sinned
Done this evil in thy sight
Thou mightiest be justified
Thou mightiest be justified
For behold
I was conceived in iniquities
In sin did my mother
Bear me
Bury me
Damned me
To my grave
Bear me
Bury me
Damned me
To my grave
