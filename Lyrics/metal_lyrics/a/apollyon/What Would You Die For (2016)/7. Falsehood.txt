[feat. Nathan Wackett]I hear all your words
I don't believe any of them
You've knowingly misled your congregation
Further into sin
You will  suffer
For the damage that you've done
Serving only the fallen
Misrepresenting the Son

How can you read with your eyes closed
You claim to preach from a book that you don't know
How can you see through a blindfold
You claim to lead for a God that you don't know 
How can you read with your eyes closed
You claim to preach from a book that you don't know
How can you see through a blindfold
You claim to lead for a God that you don't know   

You preach obedience yet live life so defiantly
Making a mockery of everything you claim to be
When will you learn
You serve a master who lives to watch you burn

You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your fatherâs desires
He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him
When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies


How can you see through a blindfold
You claim to lead for a God that you don't know 
How can you read with your eyes closed
You claim to preach from a book that you don't know

How can you read with your eyes closed
You claim to preach from a book that you don't know
How can you see through a blindfold
You claim to lead for a God that you don't know
