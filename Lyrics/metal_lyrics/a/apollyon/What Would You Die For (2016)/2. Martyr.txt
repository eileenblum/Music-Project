What do you live for, long for, stand for, cry for 
Tell me with a gun against your head, what would you die for

What do you live for, long for, stand for, cry for 
Tell me with a gun against your head, what would you die for
Live for, long for, stand for, cry for 
Tell me with a gun against your head, what would you die for

No one can take my life from me
I sacrifice it voluntarily
For I have the authority to lay it down
When I want to and also to take it up again
For this is what my Father has commanded.

What would you die for

Live for, long for, stand for, cry for 
Tell me with a gun against your head, what would you die for

Live for, long for, stand for, cry for 
Tell me with a gun against your head, what would you die for

What would you die for [4x]
What do you live for, long for, stand for, cry for 
Tell me with a gun against your head, what would you die for
Live for, long for, stand for, cry for 
Tell me with a gun against your head, what would you die for
