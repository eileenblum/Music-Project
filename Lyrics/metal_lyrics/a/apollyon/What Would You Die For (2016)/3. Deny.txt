I won't deny
My faith in Christ
Pull of pride
You'll watch me die
While he cries 
By my side 
We'll watch him rise
Be terrified of the eternal one 
The sovereign being 
My blood on your hands that day you will see
Not everything can be taken by brute force
You were mistaken 
You've been forsaken

I won't deny 
My faith in Christ 
We'll watch him rise
Be terrified of the eternal one
The sovereign being 
My blood on your hands 
That day you will see
Not everything can be taken by brute force
You were mistaken 
You've been forsaken

Kill my life 
Gut me
Rip me
In to pieces 
My body
Mangled and torn
Lifeless 
I will rot at your feet
Then you will see
The face of true terror

I won't deny
Faith in Christ
Watch him rise
Be terrified
