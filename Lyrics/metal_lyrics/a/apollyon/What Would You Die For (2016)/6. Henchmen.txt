[feat. Adam Cody of Glass Casket]Your ignorance is bliss
Especially in this case
You are unknowingly following a dark rebellion
By bearing the icons of my praise
On your jewelry
On your garments
Cut and pierced into your skin
You so proudly flaunt the symbols
Inspired by my sin
On your jewelry
On your garments
Cut and pierced into your skin
You so proudly flaunt the symbols
Inspired by my sin
Henchmen

Pitiful humans
Welcome to our syndicate
You've fallen victim to yourselves once again
Your selfish ambitions have always betrayed you
You're nothing more than vessels in the end
Become filled with these things otherworldly
By blindly following the trends
Become filled with beings otherworldly
You're nothing more than vessels in the end
Resistance is futile
Your existence futile
Resistance is futile
Your existence is mine
We use deception to feed your desires
We use your flesh to feed the flames
You draw the circles to summon the demons
And you don't even know our names
Over and over
You fall under our spell
Over and over
We find a place inside of you to dwell
Kicking and screaming
We'll drag you all straight to Hell
Kicking and screaming
A sound I know so well

Your ignorance is bliss
Especially in this case
You are unknowingly following a dark rebellion
By bearing the icons of my praise
