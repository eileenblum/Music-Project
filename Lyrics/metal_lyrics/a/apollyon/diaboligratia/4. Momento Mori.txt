I gaze at the gray sunless sky
I feel the pain as I'm about to die
To my grave I go
To the pits of hell I shall flow
My funeral march is crossing the cemetery slowly
In the background lies the church so sad and lonely

Strange things in the world of darkness I'll see
Just like a nightmare it'll be
I am far below the ground
By chains in hell I have been bound

I am hellbound

Momento mori
Mors ultima ratio
Momento mori
Requi' escat in pace
