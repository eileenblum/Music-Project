I am your son
Silent for too long
Scared of what I've become
And knowing I'm not involved
It's all been too much
Now it's getting so hard to breathe
I let you take everything
But I will rebuild
Atop your shattered bones

I must be strong
Endeavor to carry on
Find purpose to right your wrongs
Get back to where I belong
But it's all come undone

And you want me to hurt like you
Your attempts have failed
I will see this through
And everything has come to be
The choices you make
Are for eternity
