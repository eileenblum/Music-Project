We don't see things the same way anymore
Anymore
We don't see things the same way anymore
Anymore

Now I had faith in you
And faith is everything
I had no need for angels
I need no choir to sing

So wrap me up in secrets
And keep them like a curse
I know you tried so hard
But you only made it worse

We don't see things the same way anymore
Anymore
We don't see things the same way anymore
Anymore
