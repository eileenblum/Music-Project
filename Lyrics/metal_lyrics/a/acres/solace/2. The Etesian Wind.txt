Here I stand empty handed
With a view up high of everything
Never knowing where I came from
Or where I've been
A flash of light you're lost to me

Leave me in pieces with nothing for thought
But the hearts of better men
Leave me here and I'll just try to start again

I am not the one you want
What you been searching for lies in your heart
I am not the one you want
All your promises will fall apart

Because your faith is just a front
Your faith is just a front
I wish that you'd see the truth
But the truth is that you can't
That your faith is just a front

Don't you try and turn away
Don't you dare forget my name

Here we stand empty handed
With a view up high of everything
Never knowing where we came from
Or where we've been
A flash of light and your lost to me
