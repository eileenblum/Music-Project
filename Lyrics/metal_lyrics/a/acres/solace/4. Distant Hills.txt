If this is what it feels like under my skin
Then I will take your heart again
My dreams have died so very often
But not this time, not this time
I swear I will never ask you again
If you'd only take my hand
When you're a child and you're looking for someone
To fall in love, and fall apart

Don't

Don't go..
Don't go..
Please don't go..
Don't go..
Don't go..
