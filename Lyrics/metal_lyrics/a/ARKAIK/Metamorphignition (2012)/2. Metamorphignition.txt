Soaking in the mists of cremation
Embalmed within the grasp of flame
Count the crows that peck through the dilations
Destiny leans in and through her
Vaporous lips she unveils her name

It is time to stand upon the altar
Prick the skin to its platelets
Flame it dances like a fleet of knives to
Draw upon his flesh
To commence this odyssey upon his death
These walls tie
Their rapture tight

Riding a thousand points of white light into
A screaming abyss of beautiful cacophony
Flame wrought dimension projection
A shard wave passage into wonderful agony
Drosophilia mindscapes
Take me further than realms bound infinite
A sonic metamorphosis of consciousness
Casting him further away

She sings with a tongue of sulfur
An ember filled gaze that stays raging bright
Her kiss is a carving caress
Cutting deeper through the flesh
Holding tight to vascular curtains

I've been burning for some time now
Reality opens its mouth
A swan dive into laughing prisms
Galloping their lightning stride
They shatter to a million pieces
Cyrix projects from his body
Long since laughing at the needles
Scattering fragments of the grand beyond
Now it breaks apart

Riding a thousand points of white light into
A screaming abyss of beautiful cacophony
Flame wrought dimension projection
A shard wave passage into wonderful agony
Drosophilia mindscapes
Take me further than realms bound infinite
A sonic metamorphosis of consciousness
Casting him further away
