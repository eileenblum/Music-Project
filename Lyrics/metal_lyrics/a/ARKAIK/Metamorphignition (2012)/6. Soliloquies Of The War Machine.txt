Emerging from skeletal canopies
Mask lit embers peering through the carves
Rusted fingers begin to purge
Through the silhouettes of ether
Crafting an end to the elements
Sawing the branches to dust
Speaking a beginning to empires
Grasping upwards their geometry
Encompassing a snarl of tapestries
Here is a machine that toils its rapture

Mounting its abrasions on the corpse of humanity
Iron sided tears feed its mask of skeletal masterpieces

It rips to pieces all it touches
And so it feeds on all that spills
It is the force of all that plunders
A heaving city forged of steel

Wreaking its havoc upon the burial ground
That soaks away the fumes of life

The machine grinds away
Destroying as a means to an end
Ripping away light that snaps apart like bright ligaments
Once attached to the body of reason

This is a city thats feeds upon
The sunrise leaking clawline to the
Forest grasping at its tracts
To suckle its bile flacking auras
It hungers in darkness for those who lapse into its frenzy
Draining horizons of catching spectacle
And shoving them full of its choking exhale

Curses that claw at the cradles of nurture
Camouflaged to pierce the armor of nature
As the chains of disgust hang from its iron viscera
Hemorrhaging eyes rolling back words in orgiastic havoc
It welled tears of acid rain and Malevolex lurched to comfort
As it spoke from sewer grated eyelids casting at its yellowed pupils
In the way of a quest existential

The machine grinds away
Destroying as a means to an end
Ripping away light that snaps apart like bright ligaments
Once attached to the body of reason

The slave to all war and consequence rolled its tongue beneath the sun
It slid bolt carved teeth into conversation
"We are all chained from underneath those within the shadowsphere,
They will drag us through gilded flames of greed and fear"
"Your flesh reads this tragedy and you wear it like the walls they build
Break them down, and through destruction brings creation's will"
