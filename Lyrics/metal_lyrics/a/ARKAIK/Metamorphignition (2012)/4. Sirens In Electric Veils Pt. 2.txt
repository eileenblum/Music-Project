The stones begin to melt unto branches
Altar top cracks split to her eve of bent scratches
Light from behind ceases to escape

Leaving to enter forests standing in jagged menace
Iced blades hang agleam pointing their taunt as

The gallows red horizon dies into winters shade
Screams swallowed in the shadows
Grown into the belly of hate

No flesh is safe in this place of stabbing reveries
Among the flames of suture
Cast unto destinations maze

âThere are two, I and her
We are the antithesis complete in our respite
We are bound to the mercy of our whimsâ

Her woods have long been blackened
And chromed to a crystal degree
Ravens held standing in the mists
This canopy of claws
Hungers for wine of bleeding jagged limbs
Malevolex enters
A wing of abstract shards hisses for a perch
Bleeding tones over hooded gowns
She tangles to her lurch

She says âDark sided wandering
In my branches are we know?â
Lifting a broken glass smirk and gurgling starkly

Weaving your truths beyond the doorway of cosmic ideals
All universe creeping ever seething in its undertow
Your visions burned into the sightless web of seeing lives
The reasons grasp the ever weaving swarm of heaving flies
She stands bloodshot sifting like magma
Staining half ben pouring vile plasma

They came together and fulfilling one another
In thought and deed
Blue for the side gleaming truth sent
Their being separate in its entity
Two parts to the same cycle
The universe knew them as

An alchemy of unity
The spectrum light shading all
As above, so below
The living and seething space between the poles
