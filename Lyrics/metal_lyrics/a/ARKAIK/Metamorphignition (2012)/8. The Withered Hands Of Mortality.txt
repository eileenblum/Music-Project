âNow we must leave youâ she said
Scattering their perch to float like
Leaves that retreat onward past
The horizons captive visions
Vanished into dispersions
Projecting into bleak excursion
Cyrix walks among the cracks of this decimated land

Sands of wasted monuments like pillars of the dead
Sheathing and cracking
The sun beat desert floor an diamond crested sky
With stone hands peeling back

Carriers of times anomaly
Breaking apart and realigning

This desert is an hourglass
Its sands fall through holes in the double helix
Crystalline grains pour upon the monuments
Only building them ever higher

Sucking dry the life force inertia
On for miles in baked clay silence

Into the distance peering the sight of the desert
The dead landscape lurching to a halt infinitely

Destination is a penance for a journeys perjury
A sight is seen inside a forming myriad of deadening
On into the infinite they reach into a sea of depth
Draping massive curtains blowing red into the dragons breath
They reach into the sky hanging
From celestial vines guiding

Carriers of times anomaly
Breaking apart and realigning
Shining through eternity

This desert is the hourglass
Its sands fall through holes in the double helix
Crystalline grains pour upon the monuments
Only building them ever higher
This desert is times final staircase
Nothing escapes the grasp of its ruin
Onward treading into the withering fade
We all march here eventually

Take hold Cyrix
Behind drape curtains
Lies the one immutable center

Now invoked
Skies open
Fall inside
Go within
