Awakening amongst the shadows of the unknown
Her singing seduces
Ears rings in a temple of ancient magnificence
Risen statuesque forms that taper
Ever brilliant shades caress like a brick throne in truth
A doorway awaits in which to traipse
The parallels of mystery the secrets of magnitude
Spill from her mouth reminiscent of her hue

I am what has been sought for for ages
Chapters of radiance spill from my pages
Some die for me as I remain ageless
Some kill in desperate rages
I am the warm embrace of the mother
Split from the eyes and thee shall discover
I come in two forms not separate for this is
The highest degree of the permeating
Life force that is

Cloaked behind a veil
Carry their harmony into ears
That devour their vowels
Only to want more

Shed their diatribes into effervescent
Eyes mirroring the sky, a mistress of the wind
âWho are you?â
Amoriaâ¦
Lights cut to the pupil
Draping gaze upon the sight
Of unblinking eyes
Words sung like sweet destruction
Of convulsing spectrum weaving into one
Sightless mind

Grasping for answers with a shivering spine
Sweeping rays of gilded light
Summon to her temple divine sight
Spiral out in shining transition
Her essence is the sacred song of wisdom

I am what has been sought for for ages
Chapters of radiance spill from my pages
Some die for me as I remain ageless
Some kill in desperate rages
I am the warm embrace of the mother
Split from the eyes and thee shall discover
Iâve come to decode the inscriptions of your flesh
Shadows behold the catacombs of lightâ¦
She left
