Moving toward daggered clocks spinning crucifix diameter
Facades lit her face a decree captured ominous
She knew the destination and the hands of inward cloaking
The light that whispered psalms unto its captor of invoking

Sunrise bent eclipse
To its fevered imagination of denial
Asphyxiated on martyrs
Bludgeoned by interpretations
Of the nations spilling from their pores
A change is imminent
Barbed and curling outwards
Caught in the esophagus

âI beckon you closerâ
Were his declaration carved in thorns
âThey say the end is nearâ
So I will swallow it all and stare blindly at the sun
Until my own self inflicted exile
âLeave me be in solitude, I must sate the crying bleaknessâ
It whispered

Burning from the inside out
Like holy pages caught in wildfire

What I show you are truths bled from lies
No time to sleep incubate open wide
Carved of ignorance let the parasite inside
You will find bliss will shade the iron curtains blind

Wild eyed exploration casts a crawl to its rant
Writhing in lunatic glances to his swelling breath
The laughing prophet shrieks of doom
Spoken static mastication
Soothing with a butcherâs touch
His sermon speaks of vile elation

Breathing catches ashen spells
Spawning in cavities burrowed like wells
