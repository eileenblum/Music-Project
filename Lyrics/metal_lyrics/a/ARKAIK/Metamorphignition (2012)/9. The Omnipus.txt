Now caught in lapsing grandeur
The curtains part into sun
The cosmos delighted expression
Started were the end nears
Gripping tangles to breath out
Seas uncharted and swallowed whole
For endless shadows away from the cracked hands

Throwing Cyrix headlong
Into the shadow web illuminated

Drawn forth to swan dive into the matrixsphere
Crashing into fractal vapor trails
At the edges of eternity
Its riptide still lingering
The ocean inter dimensional
It sways through him

Pulls him into its threads
Currents electrified
Rearing toward the future
Pulling him apart at the speed of light
Cornering the distant iridescent beams
Within each breath

A crawling scream to the meta universal coils
In the pupil of a creature thriving
Its marvelous alchemy
Infinite wings conducting life with its finesse

âI am the omnipus
The sea of eternal flux is the seed and the womb
Let it rip you into its embraceâ

Gripping the sutured remains of reality
The omnipus expands its arms in perfect symmetry
Convulsing into an infinite stream
It writhes into the lattice
Shooting through the metatronâs cube
Mindscape star gate matter

Feeling the elated pulses of platonic solids
As they exhaled dark matter fractal pyramids

Endless curtains of DNA strands binding the infrared
Crystal spirals of energy swelled toward invisible landscapes
The karma code carving upon the genetic matrix
Into the highest echelons of freedom it unfurled and it began to speak

âThe truth rings deep inside
At the core of your inner being
But at first you must let attachment to planes
Fall through fleeting gripâ

Linear time illusions collapse as electric spinal fluid drips
Folding over energetic time waves spirit unhinged
It held creation from the sine waves forming life
In perfect silence forming answers all within
