The fires of the great work
Igniting the altars of supressed discernment
Temples of servitude crumbled from action
Brought forth dredging in the chasms

Metacognitive alchemy
Reinvigoration fueling the resistance
From the adverse forces that toil
In what never can be ruled

A microcosm of shadowed province
Unlit domains exhumed
Where undertows of a bleak configuration
Emanates and awaits the light of the truth

Down and into the trenches at all costs
Through the labyrinthine mires
Through this raging tempest we must go
Deeper into the vacuum we are deployed

Frail of mind and shallow of breath
The alchemy of will and the profane
Made sacred, the warrior must rage

The soul imprinted parchment
The spine, the world and the quill
The process of bio-activating the flesh temple

Waking secrets from sleep
The harvest of knowledge
Bathing darkness into new luminous depth
Crawling from branches to roots
Left gazing into the majestic obsidian eyes

Electric thoughts intertwined
On the plane of the elemental mind
Every seed thrown heeds it's rise
From strife it's limbs were shaken
Breathing the semblance of the all

Radiating from the pages of this living book
Symbols charged with iconic fibers
Carried like wreaths
Held tight in a solar serpents clench

Occultivated freedom swings from legions
Coveting seed of the awakened mind
Disguised in the fabric of the pleroma
The fires of the great work
Lighting the eons to come

The journey feeds itself
The blaze is just beginning
The reign of Kaliphar has been defaced
It's shaking, as her lighting
It strikes in the eyes of the septic masters

The wrath of Nemethia
Her vengeance tearing through
The vile and initiating higher senses
Aggregating amanuensis
Scribing the ancient spiral
