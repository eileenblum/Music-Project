Self-immolation set his sail toward the Hierogon
Those who are summoned and absorbed into the inner circle
They are the order of which few remain
Inner cycles that inhale existence and rain order onto chaos
Fractured shadows whisper songs unto the sirens palms
Aaru the eldest held close the vital relic
Peering through the cypher in the mist
He was the wisest with whom the keeper of spells sits
Awaiting the dweller on the threshold
The astral lifeline synthesized, in a construct built in the sky
The land of the unfolding infinite
Her story was theirs to keep in the temple of old ruin
Through the dreadful she will lead you to the kingdom of
Creation Rare crystalline forms taking shape
As her siren song serenades
Bowing to the Order of the Hierogon
A sacred circle that binds the truth eternal
Etched into the sentient apparatus
He who holds the mechanism finds the orient
Realizing starseed incarnation
Cyrix discovers the clockwork of subtle cues
As the many fold emanations imbued
Sprung from the tree of life
Mythic ancient goddess given breath
Entering into and filling the Middle artery and
through the trench of death that lies at the heart
Through layers deep within oneself is where she resides
This is how she remained
Unforgotten though the darkness
Dwelling deep within the catacombs
This hidden council drew nearest to the flame
But in time their numbers dwindled and the truest few who knew
Her name remained
In their silence her secrets kept
Within their hearts their fires burned in conviction
The roots of ancient trees buried within their ringlets
The astral lifeline synthesized in a construct built in the sky
The land of the unfolding infinite
Her story was theirs to keep in the temple of old ruin
The relic was theirs to keep until the time of untold cruelness
Soon the secrets shall be revealed
Flesh of the ancient masters unpeeled
When the book is opened and the portals have risen
And the few chosen will enter as prophesied
And the relic wrote its lines and it
Disintegrated before their eyes
Televate the visions of indigenous resolve
Oceanic mechanism ripple in tidal forms
Her gardens revealing the city of secrets
Undercurrents long past in times swimming eyes
The bridge aquatic contains the yet refined
Elaborate faces holotropic cosmic oasis
Bowing to the Order of the Hierogon
A sacred circle that binds the truth eternal
Etched into the sentient apparatus
He who holds the mechanism finds the orient
Realizing starseed incarnation
Cyrix discovers the clockwork of subtle cues
As the many fold emanations imbues
Sprung from the tree of life
Mythic ancient goddess given breath
Entering into and filing the
Middle artery and through the trench of death that lies at the heart
Through layers deep within oneself is where she resides
This is how she remained unforgotten through the darkness
