Behold, the land is quenched
Blood stained and violence drenched
The sovereign king of lies clenches ringed fists
The writhing oracle drips within her odious mists
Her name is Pyphina, stolen in infancy
She who knows yet to be impending timelines
They oracle spoke
"Stripped of pure essence, gutted every grave desecrated
Sold to the pillaging in pain"
Sitting in the anguish and drawn into crimson stalls
Tearing cryptic visions in the mythic rift
She sees the future bound premonitions she's speaking now
"Through the eyes of the cypher
In the silence we breed
Until the shackles lift from our feet
Through the cycles we savor in the sowing of seed"
What will become of her visions from the Celestine sky
Demented and feral the oppressors
Avaricious he licked his fangs of spite
And spit with might and twisted wit he spewed his malignant
Vindictive writ, ill will cradle and bleeding in lesions, the leprous call
Forlorn words of the tormentor rang
Despicable of the walls once filled with splendor
"Your fear tastes sweet" he spoke of
Blind weakness and eternity
Vultures summoned to the corpse of freedom
They will taste the flesh of our retribution until
Their entrails will drape the walls of their kingdom
As blood runs from their lips
They drink from the chalice of pain
As they sit on the throne of death
They deserve the suffering I will inflict
In the highest realm the land of Zatheos
Now riddled and plagued
The oracle spoke
"The pleroma awaits to be immortalized in time
On the path of trails beware of hidden threats,
Merge with the absolute just beyond the sight"
Take heed of the seeds of those whom you make belled
They will one day rise into the chasm
Where light was banished
Vanishing insanity threshold beckoning
Zatheos was once the crown of the planets helm
But the traitors had long since conquered
And eclipsed her realm
Blindness had over taken, and the rest of the higher worlds
Were too forsaken
With violence I will maim them until they believe
With violence I will save them
Harvesting the appetite that's clawing from inside
Vital integration
