I gaze in wonder upon creation
Existence amazes me with its divine manifestation
The clockwork of reality woven by time
These complexities have frozen my mind

Sands that fall through glasses cosmological land to create the pyramids of
Numinous vibrancy balanced atop these ever heighteningÂ 
Designs are interlocking synchronized molecular phenomenon's
The conscious vibrations transfer

[Chorus:]
The fabric of existence forever guides me
Infinity is elusive as its serene hand sets me free

Endless patterns returning to consequence
Is it me or is destiny the truth behind the-

Sands that fall through glasses cosmological land to create the pyramids of
Numinous vibrancy balanced atop these ever heightening
Designs are interlocking synchronized molecular phenomenon's
The conscious vibrations transverse

[Chorus]

Inner veracity aligned with all being
The eyes of the cosmos seen through the forefront of eternity

Stand back and witness the concrete nature of the erratic
This is the multitudinous, we are the pieces, the machine will run without us
Will we find our ebb in the tide
