Â 
Refractions of obsidian assimilation Blending unique through never ending prisms
A kaleidoscope of corridors spiraling within a maze of symmetry
Within a spark, unto itself
Folding over to create a chasm of creation
A light that spreads in all directions and crosses back upon itself
Â 
An enigmatic lattice, that reaches beyond the fathoms of time
And into its own presence inside the structure that spawned ageless cosmos
Â 
[Chorus:]
Beheld by all who traipse the boundaries of realityÂ 
Transcend the limits of thought into blinding swells
Of convulsing wavelengths, all directions these reflections coalesce
Â 
Staring back at one another
Sacred mirrors assimilating the dynamic of space and time
Coiling vibrant grid-works that reminisce unto the future
Stare into the Tetragrammaton mirror
The equilibrium of existence, a continuum of duality
All sides interlocked to create life
Â 
These reflections harbor the dual nature of reality
The symmetry writhes its chaos upon all angles
All sides a precipice spring board
Of the reflections within dissonance
Â 
Unfurl this pestilence and find that in all things
Lies the nature of their opposites
If one exists then so must its contrary
Unfurl this pestilence and find that in all things
Lies the nature of their opposites
Without the one, the others would cease to be
Â 
An enigmatic lattice, that reaches beyond the fathoms of time
And into its own presence inside the structure that spawned
Â 
[Chorus]
Â 
Each piece of the clockwork toils to the rhythm
Of the winding cosmos lost in its reflection
