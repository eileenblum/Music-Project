Â 
Deceit, disease, decline, this virus contradicting reason and theology
Contrasting ideologies fuel the vehemence through the imaginations of humankind
They are a part of the same feral beast, whose venom drips from ivory fangs
Waiting to rend the vacillating mind, her feast is our collapse incarnate
Â 
This succubus sits perched on a throne of misconceptions
She lies in a stagnant pool of spiritual afterbirth
Pregnant with deception she spreads her wings
As we receive her miscarriages willingly
The abscesses of human thought grow as she rapes her mind of its reason
Â 
Hope, faith, hypocrisy, rebellion, contorted into lifestyle distortions
Are the spawn that become her paradigm abortions
She feeds her dead offspring to the masses, holy men and counter culture
Both convulse in hunger, reduced to pains of famine
They will tell you who to worship, and advise you who to hate
You have become the canvas upon which they scrape their paint
Â 
All paths of logic lead to some form of light
Needle feast hemorrhages try to rip reason from insight
Clots from the womb pour forth with tides of delusion
We have become lost in a sea of illusion
Â 
[Chorus:]
There is a path of light for those who aren't blinded by the lies that their fed
There are still minds in which logic and the divine have not departed
From malignant tongues forked in abhorrence
Their odium seeps piercingly into the common rationality
Kneel to the snake, kneel to the stake, either side breeds filth
Seek the knowledge you wish to gain and think for your fucking self
Â 
The wonder in the unknown, the infinite Scraped away by clawed hands in jagged grip
Perceive the sacrifice of common sense staked
Ways of thought that disguise true meaning
Deceiving distractions seizing our eyes and our minds
Leaving shrouds of divinity
Â 
Bleeding us of our foresight, leaving origins cauterized, these inconsistencies of thought
Shall reap their stench and tear us under
As we rot in withered tatters, decayed within mounds of ruin
We must ascend beyond these paradigms of hypocrisy
For reason and insight are locked away in the enveloping patterns of destiny
Â 
[Chorus]
