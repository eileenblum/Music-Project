Splatter the canvas of being, resonate with the essence of radiance
Tread the path deep within the outside realm, and dissasimulate to become whole
Â 
Vibrate in unison with the symphony of existence
Its crescendos sweep through the dimensions of reality
Â 
Mythical ethos falling through the glass, shattering memories past
A multitude of origins culminating, smell the scent of withering ash
Â 
[Chorus:]
This claims existence, ones presence uninhibited
Staining the conscious and distant, gorge the minds eye upon the cinders
The glass sits placid as a massive universe sits hidden
Gorge the minds eye, the soul is a parchment upon which creation is written
The glass sits placid as a massive universe sits hidden
Â 
The spiral unwinds, let this force take you in as whole
Under the ground of the withering monarch
Gazing in their hallowed veins, there birth remains in vast unreaching
Searching for all vital senses, an answer lies within the tempest
Ensue beyond your own well being, free reach of sightless seeing
The spiral unwinds, let this force take you in as whole
Under the ground of the withering monarch
Â 
Stacks of clamor mount upon weakened shoulders
Falter blindly as we forget our instincts
But behind the withered doors lies the answer tightly bounded
As we unlock our hidden supremacy
Â 
[Chorus]
Â 
Gazing in their hallowed veins, there birth remains in vast unreaching
Searching for all vital senses, an answer lies within the tempest
Ensue beyond your own well being, free reach of sightless seeing
Under locks of your digression, free yourself from your depression
