This constant discord is perpetual
But we can decipher and end to it
Within the scripts of wisdom found beyond the chasm of thought
The enigmatic signals of human potential
Seeking the answers that must be sought

Realize beyond our minds eye, culminate this astral desire
I have begun ascension
Cathartic energies manifested
Malevolence is now but spec upon the lattice of higher consciousness

Disaster is but a small retribution
Compared to the beings of burden that induced it
Sights and visions and hopeless acquisitions
Is this certainty or only premonition?
Contortions of the world which we've predicted
Should bring upon the advent of new occasionsÂ 

Realize beyond our minds eye, culminate this astral desire
I have begun ascension
Cathartic energies manifested
Malevolence is now but spec upon the lattice of higher consciousness

What would be better than to burn it all away?
We are the cause of all our suffering
What's the answer? Lies ruin
Devastation is wrought by our own lies

Peel back the flesh and peer inside, what is to be found?
Deep inside deception within the shell
Is the carrier of the infinite boundless light
