Strapped to a tomb of fear and loathing
Engraved upon the eulogy of dying sons
A black demiurge cackles hysteric
The voice of fear and failure
The catalyst of lessons
Courage is the light that shines through
past life repressions
Have faith weary travelers
For the time have come to prevail
One must walk through
The enigma of embers
To burn through the veil
I've been through a saga of dimensions
I've sailed through vivid dreams
Through realms holographic
I've cut quantum spirals to their seams
Call forth the siren song
of indigo aura tracings
Feel the pulse of evolutionary onset
A call to arms this holotropic process
Collective clockwork
The return of the binary sun
The great epoch held in
The hands of the eons
The undertow of a new
Cycle has approached us
Fears collapse and mirrors
Elapsing on the ALL
We knew in chaos
We would flourish
From the mortal coil
The power within you is
Vast and expansive
The cyber cage
Begins to unravel
Scattered at the feet of
Archetypes lay binding
Shackled fragments
