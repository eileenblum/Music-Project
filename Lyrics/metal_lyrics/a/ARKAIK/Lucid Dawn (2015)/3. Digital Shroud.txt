Held captive in plain sight
The reflection of blinded silence
Held captive in mounting dread
A depiction of touting violence

No escape from inside their heads
The dilemma now becoming blinded locked in
to a brand new shining prison
Khaal-Â­LiÂ­-Phar claiming himself supreme
behind the curtain the maestro of this machine

The false reality generated by hate
Perceptual slavery, we take the bait
Staring into the maze, the hall of mirrors
Cold deception a tourniquet of rage and fear

Asleep catatonic they stagger to their demise
Installed into their minds, these chains disguised as time
Pulling them further, binding them to a pyre of lies
A cybernetic playground, tear out your eyes
Replace them with the buzzing of flies

To mask the wounds, to feel alive
Bleak handed absence sold as the next new distraction
The claws that held the seams of astral realms
Forgotten, stolen was the numinous
Forbidden were their dreams

The fleshwalkers stand as prison guards
Khaal-Li-Phar as the warden
Once the cage was sealed
The nanoÂ­verse locked in
The era of diversion had begun

Malevolent masters staked their claim
The tyrant stood upon all he created
Determined to punish all, all that he hated

Enslave the masses with deceptive powers
Holding terror in vein
Frenzied, wide eyed and feral
It felt too late, but the time was of the essence
Final hour
