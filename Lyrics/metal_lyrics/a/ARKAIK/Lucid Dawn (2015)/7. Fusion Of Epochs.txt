A gazing prism laced in dreams and
Piercing the light,
Stead fast holding
I stood closely
Watching her eyes burning
As bright as the sun, before this
Eternal night had just begun
Calling out for a union,
Inner schism of centuries ago
You are the temple of life made flesh
An hourglass ocean of currents
A careening galaxy of diamond
In the absence of time
Her choirs, her hymns, her sine waves
Rattling the spine of the godhead
Initiated from slumber
I sought of this goddess
No longer torn asunder,
Unified from lost depths
A breath to the life blood
The goddess unveiled
Pulling from the source field
Tasting vast vistas of the unknown
You are the temple of life made flesh
An hourglass ocean of currents
Birthing corridors of cosmic psalms 
She levitated silently 
A breathing angelic rapture
To lift the veil
A fusion of epochs, a vibrational
Merging of the will of unity
The true test stands waiting
Overcome the living prison
Overthrow the subjugation
The tyrants will wither and fall
The fire consuming
Her heart, her fate, your soul
