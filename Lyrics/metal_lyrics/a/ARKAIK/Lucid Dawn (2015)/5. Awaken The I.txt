Emerging from the parallels of untethered dichotomy.
Seeing what has been wrought in the land of the forsaken, a lecherous existence.
Bathed in living blasphemy, sitting wide-eyed in the dark. Perpetual denial.
Now purpose reached its firm grip towards Cyrix.
The shadow had awakened within a profound knowing.
All was not lost, but no one seemed to notice, we were hooked.
Through dredges and sold to the slaughter.
There was no more denial to drag around, like a comforting corpse.
The calamity of existence pulled at his mind like feral claws.
The time is now, the end is nigh. To crash and burn or to awaken and fly.
Ringing in his ears, the voice of reason chanted its trance-inducing hymns.
Collaboration can lead to a tidal wave of freedom.
Tear off the shackles of the weak. Knowledge is the key, wisdom is power.
Let the mind bloom, take back what is ours. The machinery of existence sparked for new creation.
The time is now, the end is nigh. To crash and burn or to awaken and fly.
Courage and will, nothing can take, no masterâs dark bidding deserves us as slaves.
Once awakened, you can't go back to sleep. Apathy only aids in self-deception.
Freedom pursued is the only chance, a new era aligned.
Take flight like the feathered serpent, soaring in the sky.
Rooted in the ground, the middle path is laid, the journey profound.
