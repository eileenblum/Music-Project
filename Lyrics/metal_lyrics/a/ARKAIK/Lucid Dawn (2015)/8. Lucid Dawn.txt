Galactic consummation aligned in cosmic cycles
Entheogenesis has begun
Spirit reaching for elevation
New pathways to find freedom

Reenergizing the vital life force
On to the next spiral we are flung
Bridging the mind gap
Connected to the cosmos

All timelines converging ever onward
Gateways to starseed evolution
The story of the eons
Encoded within our being

Approaching the lucid dawn
Illuminating visions taken down the spiral beyond
Breathing this sacred pulse and bursting at the seems, pulled into the waking dream
Engulfing, decaying, lucid inner revolution

The truth of which few have seen
Now emerging from the ether
Hear, the answering is realized
She stares with glinting eyes as each unique reflection taps into the immortal mind

The illusion of all opposites now coming undone
Feeling the touch of the Dream as it exists on all dimensions, finding it's truly in our nature to overcome this oppression
To break this hypnotic deception
The story of the eons encoded within our being

Approaching the lucid dawn
Illuminating visions, the keepers of our destiny
Now all the walls coming down
Tearing the pages of decay

Facing the beasts of burden
Merging light into the hollowed piercing through into the shadow
The illusion of all opposites now coming undone."
