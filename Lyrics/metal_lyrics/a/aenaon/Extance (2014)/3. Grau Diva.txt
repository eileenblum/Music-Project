She was born in shades
Dressed with the mantle of night
Marching between the filth
Compromising with faith

She was the grail of lore
Covered with primeval needs
Haunting every sick thought
Satisfying their will

Disorder
Disease
Identity
Opposite
Stigmatized
Duality

Grau, grau, grau
Only flesh and nothing more
Needs to purify the soul
With the scars of an obscene life

Grau, grau, grau
As the spirit dived in dope
It's the temple of the sins
Metamorphosis in idols with ecstasy

Master of its own self
Above the level of shame
Disavowed even by hell
Spitting every face

In the night she's marching
Stalking for flesh and hope
Nothing and never more
Will not be changed to the bone

Contrast
Cruelty
Diversity
Compromised
Parasite
Quest for dignity

Grau, grau, grau
Only flesh and nothing more
Needs to purify the soul
With the scars of an obscene life

Grau, grau, grau
As the spirit dived in dope
It's the temple of the sins
Metamorphosis in idols with ecstasy

Hear my damned soul
The ritual of night collapsed
In earthly paradise
I search for the light

Grau, grau, grau

Grau, grau, grau
As the spirit dived in dope
It's the temple of the sins
Metamorphosis in idols with ecstasy
