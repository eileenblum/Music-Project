ErmÃ¼det vom Tode, ich werde mich ewig qualen

This man, pale, walks the path of fiery dawn,
Dressed in black, falling apart from the shadows of the boughs
For aeons, wearied and doomed with breaking idols
The end is strange, oblivion and faith, from the ruins he is reborn

For the new life, we're kissed by the viper
We yearn a divine path of death
Spreading the haze of the night with our mantle
Immortals in eerie silence

Dreams pressed upon him, in times before the sins
The breath is old, wrapped in cold black shivering
This curse will be forever, like the coffins under sail
Life is like a candle, and will always fade away

We are the conquerors of life,
Covered with shining tears
The mysteries of death, will always be ours

We are out of the world
Without moral sense
Surrounded by anger and weariness
Der mÃ¼de Tod

For the new life, we're kissed by the viper
We yearn a divine path of death
Spreading the haze of the night with our mantle
Immortals in eerie silence

Blessed are those who redeem
The explorers of faith,
You and I only exist, one shape
