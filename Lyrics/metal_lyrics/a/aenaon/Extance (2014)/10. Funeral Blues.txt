Don't stand at my grave and cry,
The human mind can't conceive the substance
Within these borders no one other exist
Don't mourn for the bravery and freedom
Only reapers, reaping the wisdom
I force the matter to collide with my mind

On the dreadful moments something sparkles inside me
On the dreadful omens, there is nothing you can't redeem

I don't accept this depth of time, so brief
The future wounds and sudden grief
Inside the body of the elder gloom
This picture gave me infinite relief
The desolation and the sorrow
for those who died, or those who are
The only fellow, a rusty gallows
just vicious night, thick like death

Dig and watch - Just stones and soil
Dig and wonder - It's necessary end
Dig and hear - The rhythm of the silence
and whisper the funeral blues

Keep fresh the grass upon the grave,
These roots will always be my chains,
Like spoils of death are shining with awe.
By this cell I drowned in the waves,
a body like ship is ready to sail,
Which is the quest I ask? Just to be wreckedâ¦

This scream is not yours,
the dead do not lie in your soil,
they become birds and trees
delivered from mortal flesh
No one can see the light, no one can feel
The generations yet to come
You're not the one, youâre not the one

Always pretending,
to be able to live the endless path of death
Coming and going, day and night,
descending to earth
How do you confront life and death,
virtue and fear?
This vision that every time burns inside,
will continue forever...
