Where the water has vanished, in the heat of the day
this world is bare and divides the fleeting rains
This is the land of gods in exile,
here the death of man remains in silence
We walked into the desert
buried into the sand
They still die in this desert
alone in this land

Their graves mark this land of no water
looking out of miles, the wind beyond eternity
What morbid grievous infinity of distance
such horror hovers all over the scene
The mighty spirit full of angry and bitterness
the dust behind in sunlight and mist
Endlessly flowing the yellow sand
digging graves with our bare hands [2x]

In a virgin sky the sun already dead
the desert, the desert, the desert I feel
we hang our death and rest in peace
Cursed be the gold, cursed be the gods
the desert, the desert, the desert I feel
we hung our skin and disappeared
As it came through the anguish, as it came through the fear
burning skies crown the cities of sand
A thousand years of wandering remained in silence
We prayed into the desert
buried into the sand
They still die in this desert
alone in this land

Alone in this land
We yell under the stars
We dreamed into the desert,
the Kingdom has come
The only heritage, lost souls and scars
