The descent from the vault 
shows itself to be infinite
Transcendent and complete
revealed an attribute of divinity

Sidereal zones of waste
another one garden of silent guilt
Religious supremacy sense 
the land of gnosis under the human beliefs
The shining orb of the moon,
the human race and the wild beasts
by earthly limbs and flesh
This fusion mass brings the world to birth

When everything has been tried in vain,
like the storm of modern duality
Marching in existence
the whole heaven shouts and shakes
The mankind was born of the waters
now it's time to return in flames
The stars are set beyond death
and heaven looked upwards for the human race.

Nailed in centuries, the fall of crest and crown
for all the fires are dim, our souls are still in bounds
And through all varied smoke and cries, the roaring of the sun,
The noise of little lives and brave, reflects the steps so far

Doom and Hope
Denial and Fate
Regret and Return
Hail! Hail! [2x]

In a cosmic reflection, immortals we will be
against the laws of gravity, we climbed and disappeared

Nailed in centuries, the fall of crest and crown
for all the fires are dim, our souls are still in bounds
And through all varied smoke and cries, the roaring of the sun,
The noise of little lives and brave, reflects the steps so far

"Some are hung splayed out, exposed to the empty winds,
some are plunged in the rushing floods - their stains,
their crimes scoured off or scorched away by fire.
Each of us must suffer his own demanding ghost.
Then we are sent to Elysium's broad expanse,
a few of us even hold these fields of joy till the long days,
a cycle of time seen through, cleanse our hard,
inveterate stains and leave us clear ethereal sense,
the eternal breath of fire purged and pure.
But all the rest, once they have turned the wheel of time for a thousand years:
God calls them forth to the Lethe, great armies of souls,
their memories blank so that they may revisit the overarching world once more
and begin to long to return to bodies yet again."
[From The Aeneid, Book VI (First, the sky and the earth) by Virgil]
