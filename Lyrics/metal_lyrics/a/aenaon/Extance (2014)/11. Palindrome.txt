Suddenly life turns around
from the blackened interior sky
A race full of empty bounds,
a dream without the old and dark seraphim eye
A trail of forsaken souls
Doomlight
Nightsource
The journey of spirituality

It's always the pain that floats to the ground
A masquerade of eternal...
Dawncrest
Mistdome
The loss of depressed morality
Coldborn
Oathbounds
The centuries of mankind withered again

Fear and time
The perfect rhyme
The crumbling walls come forth for the palindrome
for the palindrome
The ageless why
Spirits from far away
The sorrow with a sigh will swallow all the gales
For the palindrome

Where the breaths sedate,
Bent the mortal bow (of sins)
A structure of escape
Will set mankind in hate
downfall and pure decay

Who will unlock the lands beyond our death
And who will crush the gate of the chains
Behind the speechless doors dreams watch and break

Fear and time
The perfect rhyme
The crumbling walls come forth for the palindrome
for the palindrome
The ageless why
Spirits from far away
The sorrow with a sigh will swallow all the gales
For the palindrome

Creep through the gates
Where comets with fiery trails
Embrace the divinity
Stargazers of life and death
All heavens are sealed
Dwellings near urns
A small vessel in abyss
Thin hands are reaching for the flames
To enlighten (the godsend race)

The seasons do not change for the mass
begotten and blessed are all the sufferers
All the fields lie above the empty world
springing up from tombs and then they fall
and they fall, at the end of the beginning
in a life's palindrome, palindrome
Into the night it chases the fire across the shadows
pointed so far, and wide in life's torch
The souls sleep, over the reflection
of the wanderer's times and wars
The idols, foreshadow
the plague and wrath of incarnated leaps

Spacetime
Wrathvine
Devotion of ethereal zone
Frostrite
Mournhymns
the stars of inhuman throne
Bloodscars
Galestars
the future drowned, hopeless and weak
Graverush
Thornblast
into the whirlpool of cyclone's life
