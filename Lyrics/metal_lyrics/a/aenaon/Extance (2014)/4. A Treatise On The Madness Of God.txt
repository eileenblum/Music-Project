God has been heard to speak
in many enraged remorses
High, high from the blasphemous peak
the paradise was built with corpses

God has been heard to end
in life there no trust or pity
Blamed and nailed, the sins from past
full of god's guilty
In the vortex of scarlet demise, the seeds of unbelief creations
excelling from murders, excelling from lies, this is the road of internal damnation
The scars of a brain in the torment of haze, depressed without execution
deranged of ambitions, a god to extinction, the terror of witness confession

Without sense all the shapes of deceiver,
a madness with no cause
Every time for the crown, the Redeemer,
will he break the moral laws
The labyrinth of mind from the believers,
a vortex full of clones
In the madness of god and fever,
the dimension of fraud

In solitude, he drowned
surrounded by thousand slaves
A measure for flesh and soul
the art of seven days

And he paints marbling graves,
around the land of fake idols
He despised the words and prophecies
And binding the inmost desires.

Hither, thither, oh fearless masterless
Hither, thither, grounded by angriness [2x]

Without sense all the shapes of deceiver,
a madness with no cause
Every time for the crown, the Redeemer,
will he break the moral laws
The labyrinth of mind from the believers,
a vortex full of clones
In the madness of god and fever,
the dimension of fraud

God has been heard to weep
intended of falling forever
Blind and lost by design of will
of trash and unwashed guilt
God has been reap
