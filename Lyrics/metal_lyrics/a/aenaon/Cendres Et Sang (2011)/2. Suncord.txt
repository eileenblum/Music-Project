By distress emanate all the cyclones
Demoralizing all the grades of depress
Reflection, defection and destruction
Paraphrase in seven effects

Without sign
A masterpiece of endless torn
Never-ending is the light of the unknown...

Suncord

The only light - The only truth
The eyes of a blind, an ocean of doom
The ultimate methods of birth
The paradise of golden age

From the waters
The sounds are recollect... to the sky
A mushroom cloud in distress
Never-ending is the light
Of the unknown

To the creed of Sun and God...

Suncord - a hole in our mind
Suncord - the fire of our kind

Never-ending is the light of the unknown
An ancient parasite is yearning for the dawn
The source of Suncord

From the pyre we are rising close to the top
Higher than desperation of the golden dawn
As the rays reborn today for the next revenge
Higher than desperation we are bleeding death

The only light - The only truth
The eyes of a blind, an ocean of doom
The ultimate methods of birth
The paradise of golden age
