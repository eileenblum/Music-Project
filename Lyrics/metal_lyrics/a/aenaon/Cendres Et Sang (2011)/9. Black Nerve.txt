Nerveless body torn
Black as gloomy tar
Like star that suddenly is falling to the ground
Emptiness and calm

A strongly pain in the fields of neurotic sleep
A conscious feeling which unite the painful rage
Obsessive sickness, anxiety
Fake disorders, passivity

Falling down to the delusion's realm
Confusion sense
Do you remember the sadness
For the cognitive truth
Falling down, do you remember the flow?

Thinking clear
Feeling weak
Sensing paranormal
The trinity of your kind

Gods and demons in a jar of thought
Separate the fake from the real

Falling down to the delusion's realm
Confusion sense
Do you remember the sadness
For the cognitive truth
Falling down, do you remember the flow

Deadly necrotic systems
This pain will always be there
To purge life from me
To embrace the eternal calm
A structure of veins
A compass of innocence
