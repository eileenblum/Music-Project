Necroscope
I can see to the other side
I can feel the dying sign
It's a vision that brings the vacant light to surface

Sovereign of apocryphal dimensions
Liberate the spirits of doom

Necroscope
My one precious telescope
A navigator to the opposite edge
A silver dimension that drives everything in space

Sovereign of apocryphal dimensions
Liberate the spirits of doom

A sudden death is always like a sudden kiss
The smell of rotting flesh will always be there

I see the Hand to approaching in my eye
I consider the truth is an absent vibe
Like a blind man that can see the blaze
I follow the destiny into my own haze

Far away, they are dying
I stand and watch
Far away from the light
The sudden birth
Far away, they are dying
A sonic chaos
Far away from the light
A divine watcher, architect of life

Necroscope,
The only guide to the unknown
A tool to watch the source of god
An instrument of the devil's shore

I see the Hand to approaching in my eye
I consider the truth is an absent vibe

Descent, human act -
A Sinful watcher
Confess the sins
Symmetric fact
Stairs to the unknown

Absence of mankind
A healing tool
Swear to the top
Like a sick of faith
