Face straight down to the endless depths
Cage stained with blood of devil's sons
Defiled all the frowns of psychopaths
Walls collapse, poles apart to the...

Faith dead calm for the souls that lost
Eyes closed tight and praying to god
Trembling warm breath and disharmony
Walls collapse, poles apart to the...

Suicidal cross, so many years ago
Stare into the life, a haze for your torment
Suicide, suicide..., wrapped in nothing

Face straight down to the endless depths
Cage stained with blood of devil's sons
Defiled all the frowns of psychopaths
Walls collapse, poles apart to the...

A knowledge for the aeons of slavery
The sound of genocide

Desperate and alone
Storming down the pillars
A blasphemy from apart
The instinct of killer
The one for the soul and skin
A curse for life
A labyrinth with repeat
A hole in our mind

Once Finite - Burning the end of time
Once Finite - Trembling the god's hand
Once Finite - A line of sand and tears
Once Finite - Holiness from the past
