[performed by Aenaon]The Avenger slept
Upon the wooden throne of filth
Incarnated through the flames
to live the inner birth like a cattle...

Scorn, torn, endless faith
the apocalypse of human shame
a watcher doped with immortality
the salvation, the inspiration of a new world

A leader, a super dealer
Par aesthetic - intoxicated
The journey of an unknown hero
A fragile balance turns out to zero

We are following you
On the last night
The One who pass the path
For another time 
Through the flames of his funeral pyre
He revived to tell what he saw
For the souls at the underworld

Here is the path of souls
There's a crack upon the sky
Watching what is wrong and right
An endless Armageddon

Hordes, Life and Death - The Exit Way
Lights, Holes, Steps - The side of insanity
Frames, Walls and Lines - A spiritual path
Surviving from the amazing trap

Scales of moral, a ladder shape
celestial spheres and astral planes
Hear the story and learn the truth
It's all about the afterlife of Er

We are following you 
On the last night
The One who pass the path
For another time 
Through the flames of his funeral pyre
He revived to tell what he saw
For the souls at the underworld

Burn Fire Burn
Through the flames He rise again
He revived like hawk 
To tell us what he saw 

Death and Punishment
I spit on your laws
He was the messenger
Of the perfect truth

He stands upon the hill
And crows surround his neck

We are following you 
On the last night
The One who pass the path
For another time 
Through the flames of his funeral pyre
He revived to tell what he saw
For the souls at the underworld
