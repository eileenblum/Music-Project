Where time is but a loop,
A loose stitch in the Universal Cloth,

A Streamer might seize upon a chance, a fatal slip,

And plunge the fate of planets into chaos...
Then, a shivering light

Will appear through the shrunken cosmic dust,
And explode into an extradimensional wall, respawning the ultimate Universe...
