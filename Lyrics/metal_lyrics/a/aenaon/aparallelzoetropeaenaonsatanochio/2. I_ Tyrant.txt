Rising in fear, growing with memories of past
Hundred years, corrupting the justice of God
Methods of pain, a circus of a mankind in birth
paranoia in frames, the attitude of the eastern way of life...

Tyrant, the freedom is falling
Tyrant, monarchy as hell

Hear the law - the time of constract and creation
Feed with awe - Orders, submission, destruction

Tyrant, the freedom is falling
Tyrant, monarchy as hell

No more spawns - the era is clear and complete
Only pawns - myths, fear, disease

I stand across the world domain
I am the God of human slave
Command and reconstruct
Craving and paralyzied

My orders are only inviolate and unbroken
hear my words and act like a slave machine
I am the rule of every unspoken truth
A universal king, creator of your filth
