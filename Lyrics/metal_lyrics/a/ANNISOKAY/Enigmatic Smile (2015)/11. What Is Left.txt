I wrote these words on the street
Those words we shared and displayed
As fragile as the people we are
I am so scared to say
So fucking scared to say

Straight out of my mind and into my fear
So come on would it be that hard
In the nothing of the now
Sunk into my heart then fell apart

Oh, I love you so
Wont you please come home
I can't let go

Time has drifted away
Oh come on, could it be that hard
Will you please come home
Is it too much to ask

I miss the grace of your face
I miss the way you taste
There was no time for one last goodbye
Why did you do this,
Leaving me without a kiss

Straight out of my mind and into my fear
So come on would it be that hard
In the nothing of the now
Sunk into my heart then fell apart

I can't let go
I don't know how and I don't know when
I pray that you will be so beautiful

Time has drifted away
Oh come on, could it be that hard
Will you please come home
Is it too much to ask

I can't forget this lonely message
I can't forget these words on the street
I can't forget those words
We shared and displayed
Ill miss you

Time has drifted away
Oh come on, could it be that hard
Will you please come home
Is it too much to ask

I can't forget this lonely messages
I can't forget these words on the street
I can't forget this lonely messages
I can't forget these words on the street
Ill miss you
