You can't keep safe, everything will break
Everyone who's gone
Always goes too soon
All at once it gets hard to take
I'm asking for the moon
Every minute that I'm awake
Thoughts drown me like a typhoon

I wasn't ready to let you go
It hurts because it should
So let me force a laugh
To break the silence

Try to stay strong when you realize
That nothing lasts forever
Hold on to your memories
Cause they wont fade away
Every single missed chance
Hurts even more
When you're only
In your thoughts together
I know its hard to understand

This place we used to go
Is where I throw your ashes in the wind
Hoping and wishing
That a miracle begins

Try to stay strong when you realize
That nothing lasts forever
Hold on to your memories
Cause they wont fade away
Every single missed chance
Hurts even more
When you're only
In your thoughts together
I know its hard to understand

I will always go beside you
I will always go beside you
I will always go beside you
Hold onto hope is what I do

Some say the time will heal the wounds
To live is to die and everything will part
