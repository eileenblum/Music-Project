At the bottom of the ocean
When there's nothing left to take away
When there's nothing more to add
When there's nothing but decay

Carry me away
Like driftwood to the sea
Though the sun is long gone
You're keeping my heart strong
(You're keeping my heart strong)
(You're keeping my heart strong)

There is no darkness that I fear
Falling through lost spaces
I know everything around here gone
And there's nothing to replace this
Endless thinking is overrated
A fully open mind
Unclear ideas of what you really
And you're running out of time

You're not here anymore
I have to ask this before the dawn
You're not here anymore
So when is it okay to move on?

At the bottom of the ocean
When there's nothing left to take away
When there's nothing more to add
When there's nothing but decay

Carry me away
Like driftwood to the sea
Though the sun is long gone
You're keeping my heart strong

There is no darkness that I fear
Falling through lost spaces
I know everything around here
You're gone
And there's nothing to replace this
Don't wear a mask for so long
You will forget who's beneath it
You will forget who's beneath it
You will forget
There will be no one left to save you

You're not here anymore
I have to ask this before the dawn
You're not here anymore
So when is it okay to move on?

At the bottom of the ocean
When there's nothing left to take away
When there's nothing more to add
When there's nothing but decay

Carry me away
Like driftwood to the sea
Though the sun is long gone
You're keeping my heart strong

The fate that weights the world
Insane in lucid moments
