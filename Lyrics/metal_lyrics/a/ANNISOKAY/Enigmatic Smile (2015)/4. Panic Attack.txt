You can not predict the end
What comes tomorrow back and borrow
Backroads and shortcuts
You know them all so well

Why are you pretending
You should not be scared
To face the end here

The walls are closing in
The air is getting out
You left with nothing
But a shadow of doubt
The walls are closing in
The air is getting out
The battle is in your hands now,
Don't lay your armor down

Why are you pretending
Don't be scared to face the end
When you feel your hope is fading

When you feel your hope is fading
When you think it never stops raiking
Just stick with me
We will make it together
Yeah, just stick with me
And wait and see

Some day if we never said it
Who are you pretending
We might live to regret it
Don't be scared to face the end
A simple complication
leads to miscommunications

The walls are closing in
The air is getting out
You left with nothing
But a shadow of doubt
The walls are closing in
The air is getting out
The battle is in your hands now,
Don't lay your armor down

Why are you pretending
Don't be scared to face the end
When you feel your hope is fading

When you feel your hope is fading
When you think it never stops raiking
Just stick with me
We will make it together
Yeah, just stick with me
And wait and see
Yeah, just stick with me
And wait and see

Its alright that its so quiet
In your world tonight
Its alright that its so quiet
Your lights will shine bright to me

Its so quiet
In your world tonight
Its okay, life's like a tough crowd
And we are still growing up

When you feel your hope is fading
When you think it never stops raiking
Just stick with me
We will make it together [2x]
