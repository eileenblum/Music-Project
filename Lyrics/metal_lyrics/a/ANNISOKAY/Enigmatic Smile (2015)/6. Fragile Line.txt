I need help but I'm on an endless list
Ready to act so I wont be dismissed

My own inner conflict
I'm on my own inner conflict

Inner peace come at a great cost
Salvation is hard to find
Visions of a life lost
Are burning in my mind
This is wrong I swear blind
This is so wrong I swear blind

How is life and what is right?
I don't have all the answers yet
All I know is this is a fragile line
I want to live, live without regret

I need help but I'm on an endless list
Ready to act so I wont be dismissed

My own inner conflict
I'm on my own inner conflict

There's a price for everything
These days I haven't been sleeping
Trying to come clean
Of secrets I'm keeping

I wanna live but I need to let you
I wanna live but I need to let you die
Someones going to die
Because he wont get out of the red

Get me out of my head
Get me out of the red
Get me out of my head
Get me out of the red

How is life and what is right?
I don't have all the answers yet
All I know is this is a fragile line
Want to live, live without regret

This life is not what I thought it would be
A declaration of a poor mans death
Who you are is not what you have been
And I can not play the innocent
