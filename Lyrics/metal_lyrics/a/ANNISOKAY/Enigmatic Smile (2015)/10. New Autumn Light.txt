Let me dream of a new autumn light
I need a new start at a different time
Oh, let me dream of a new autumn light
Will you accuse me if I hide

There's no place around there
Where I fit in
This life it sucks my dreams away

So sick and pale but strangely alive
So messed up, the world turns into grey
So messed up, my inside looks like war

My life is a compromise
I can't be bothered to decide
I can't see right from my wrong
I will have to swallow some pride

Let me dream of a new autumn light
I need a new start at a different time
Oh, let me dream of a new autumn light
Will you accuse me if I hide

When I was so young and so vain
I was winning
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause
Its a shame
Yeah a real shame

My inside looks like war

My life is a compromise
I can't be bothered to decide
I can't see right from my wrong
I will have to swallow some pride

Let me dream of a new autumn light
I need a new start at a different time
Oh, let me dream of a new autumn light
Will you accuse me if I hide

So sick and pale but strangely alive
So messed up, the world turns into grey
So sick and pale but strangely alive
All washed up with many debts to pay

My inside looks like war

Let me dream of a new autumn light
I need a new start at a different time
Oh, let me dream of a new autumn light
Will you accuse me if I hide

So sick and pale but strangely alive
So messed up, the world turns into grey
So messed up, my inside looks like war
