I confess my sins
Its not about who wins
I confess my sins

Sometimes I feel like I've lost my identity
I crumble nervously
The way I fake my innocence
I'm gonna dodge all you questions
I'm gonna fake all my suggestions

I keep telling lies
I am just a liar

With every single mile I go
Another memory is fading away
After all we've been through
I come around so much more
Without you

I'm gonna dodge all you questions
I'm gonna fake all my suggestions

I keep telling lies
And love to play with fire
I act like a pathological liar

With every single mile I go
Another memory is fading away
After all we've been through
I come around so much more
Without you

On the walls of my apartment
Hang the pictures
That reminded me of her
And the way I let her down
And the way I let her down

These are thoughts I have alone
This is weighing on my mind
Maybe I'm too afraid
Maybe I want more than I really need

These are thoughts I have alone
This is weighing on my mind
After all we've been through
I come around so much more
Without you

I keep telling lies
And love to play with fire
I act like a pathological liar

With every single mile I go
Another memory is fading away
After all we've been through
I come around so much more without you

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
