Yeah, bearing down a path
We have to choose
With every fear in my brain
Being told a thousand lies
A thousand times
Just to keep us sane

Do you know what they say?
When the wolves come out of the walls
They will come out of nowhere
So you better leave
While there's still hope for escape

Pay your mind to the wolves in the walls
We shut our eyes
To see the things we lost
When the wolves bring out their claws
They will come and get you
When the darkness falls
You better leave before its all over

Pay your mind to the wolves in the walls
We shut our eyes
To see the things we lost
All we ever gave
They had planned to take
So run away,
While there is still hope for escape

I've always been afraid
Tripping on my feet
Getting down on my knees
With words too hard to speak
Quiet as a shadow whispering what I fear

I don't want to live anywhere but here
Quieter than any mouse
No my words are not in vain
This is mine
This is my house

Pay your mind to the wolves in the walls
We shut our eyes
To see the things we lost
All we ever gave
They had planned to take
So run away,
While there is still hope for escape

Each day living out a lie
A lie we need and we are taught to buy
Left alone until we find out
What this deception is all about

Bearing down a path we have to choose
With every fear in my brain
Being told a thousand lies
A thousand times
Just to keep us sane

Pay no mind to the wolves in the walls
The time has come
Reveal the memory
Rising from the grave
Where its sound and safe
Where are we now
Somewhere in the back of your mind

Pay your mind to the wolves in the walls
We shut our eyes
To see the things we lost
All we ever gave
They had planned to take
So run away,
While there is still hope for escape
