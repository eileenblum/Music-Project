This is a naked city

Faces without impression
People without make up
Their lips colorless
Sealed and cold
Keeping in step keeping in line
We do what we do because we told
Keeping in step keeping in line
Do what you do cause you are cold

Behind the tears inside the lies
Reckless hearts and absence of mind
We are all equal we are all blind
We are all equal we are all blind

In a city of eight million people
Broken bruised forgotten sore
Born free with a silver spoon
But too fucked up to care anymore

Are you brave enough?
Are you brave enough to fear?

Behind the tears inside the lies
Reckless hearts and absence of mind
We are all equal we are all blind
We are all equal we are all blind
(We are all equal we are all blind)

Torn apart slowly outside my head
Happiness is something we can't steal
The more we take the weaker we get

In the naked city
Knock loud this is my home
I wonder what the human heart is made of

Are you brave enough?
