I look up to the sky tonight
Its beautiful remember to breathe
Remember to see it all
Before I will forget (I ask)
Am I home yet (come back)

When I get lost in myself
Oh memories where did you go
I've lost all I've ever known
Forgotten the one place I've called home

Snowblind
This is the snow across my mind
Snowblind
The snow which will make me blind

Board me up
Sew me into the sheets
Fill me with coal and ice
Until the wind retreats
My organs can live without me
You can't predict the end

When I get lost in myself
Oh memories where did you go
I've lost all I've ever known
Forgotten the one place I've called home

Looking closely at the stranger in the mirror
Who's this ghost staring back at me

Please forgive me, please believe me
Cause I'm far too afraid to hell
Confinement in a dark cell

There's nowhere to hide

No ones ever seen me like this
On a motion to dismiss
I need to understand
That I'm a broken man

When I get lost in myself
Oh memories where did you go
I've lost all I've ever known
Forgotten the one place I've called home [2x]
