You're walking fast
Through the traffic lights
Faster than the wind
Flying through the fall

People are people
And sometimes we change our minds
Watch and wait before you lose it all
Autumn leaves falling down
Like pieces into place
But I will never, never let you down
In these days

Just you standing there
Without money and fame
Everything has changed
Just you standing there
Without money and fame
In your pretty dress
With no one to impress

Chasing fortune with a made up name
Everybody loves the glamour
Everybody loves the fame
But you're not lucky
You're just so confused
You don't feel pretty
You just feel used

People are people
And sometimes we change our minds
Watch and wait before you lose it all
Autumn leaves falling down
Like pieces into place
But I will never, never let you down
In these days

Just you standing there
Without money and fame
Everything has changed
Just you standing there
Without money and fame
In your pretty dress
With no one to impress
Lets pretend we cannot see
The black cloud
Lets pretend we don't know
What were talking about
Lets pretend we cannot see
The black cloud
Lets pretend we don't know
What were talking about

You thought I forgot about you long ago
Time is taking its sweet in tale of woe
I was scared but I was there
Although is took everything in me
Yeah, I was scared but I was there
Cause all we know is don't let go
