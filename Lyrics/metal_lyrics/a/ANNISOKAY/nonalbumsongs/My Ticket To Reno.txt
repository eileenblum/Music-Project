Speak up darling!
I can't hear you at this place
These were the last days I stayed with you

You are so far away from me
but I still watch you
Searching for a sign
But you're on your own now
To get it all or nothing
Just safe our mutual days
Or tear it all apart

I wish there's something I can do
Something I can feel for you

Empty words, fallen lights

So I run to lose my past
Don't wanna suffer again
But tear by tear I stumble and fall
Until I slow down to stop

I still can't say no!

Speak up darling!
I can't hear you at this place
Present and past
There's no coming back
These were the last days I stayed with you
And so I run to lose my past
Cause there's no hope in jail
Let's face the open road
It's a one way flight

And now I'm planing my escape
A guilty mind leads me
I open up my secrets
You're so far away from me

Say nothing, no say nothing
Our eyes are screaming truth

Say nothing, no say nothing
Our eyes are screaming truth
Our eyes...

Say nothing, no say nothing
Our eyes are screaming truth
Say nothing, no say nothing
Won't forget our common youth

One guilty mind is leading me
But finally I dare, finally I dare

I wish there's something I can do
Something I can feel for you
All I can do is rewind
And thinking back at our good times
