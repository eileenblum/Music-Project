Is this a battle in my head?
And all you did is cut me dead
(And all you did is cut me dead)
Hold one's peace or should I shout?
Hold it in or let it out?
(Hold it in or let it out?)
I have gone through a bad spell
Now listen to me

Please stop asking me how I am today
This is nothing I would call fine
This was the last time
In this battle of mine
(In this battle of mine)
I will let it out

Am I still the cold winter morning?
My always, my pleasure
If you ask me: how are you?
I would always say quite well
(I would always say quite well)
I have gone through a bad spell

Please stop asking me how I am today
This is nothing I would call fine
This was the last time
In this battle of mine
(In this battle of mine)

Sometimes we are hurt and bruised
Completely shattered; that's the price we pay
Sometimes the truth makes everything else seem like a lie
Makes everything seem like a lie

Still looking for a life, but I'm still alone
And my galaxy came raining down
Still looking for a life, but I'm still alone
And my galaxy came raining down
Came raining down (raining down)
My galaxy

Am I still the cold winter morning?
My always, my pleasure
Am I still the cold winter morning?
My always, my pleasure
