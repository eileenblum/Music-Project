[originally by Lady Gaga]Hello, hello, baby
You called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you see, see
Wha-Wha-What did you say?
Oh, you're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy

Kinda busy!
I'm kinda busy!
Sorry I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy!

Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you within a big mosh pit!
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you wont stop calling me
I'm kinda busy!

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop telephonin' me!
I'm busy!
Stop telephonin' me!

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

Girl, the way you're blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster!
Put my coat on faster!
Leave my dudes no faster!
I should've left my phone at home
Cause this is a disaster!
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer!

Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a concert
And I am sick and tired of my phone ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not taking no call
Cause I'll be dancing!

Cause I'll be dancing
Cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no call
Cause I'll be dancing

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop telephonin' me!
I'm busy!
Stop telephonin' me!

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

My telephone!
My telephone!
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!

My telephone!
My telephone!
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone!
