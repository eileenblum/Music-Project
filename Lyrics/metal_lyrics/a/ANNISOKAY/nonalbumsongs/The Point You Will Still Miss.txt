This does not feel right
So tell me, is the truth what you deny?

We were something special for so long
How could you think that we don't belong?
We were under a screen of fog
And it came from out of nowhere
So I was lonely by the shiver in my voice
For sure you leave me no choice

Did I spend my off time without you?
And all this time I chased you away
All this time we wasted away
Quite the reverse is true

This doesn't feel real

I feel so damn short changed
And I hope there is more I can say
I don't need your help
I got this far all by myself
You're welcome

For sure you left me no choice
But I needed to know, I simply must

Let me put it like this
I wanted to change the clock
Listen closely to this
The point you will still miss
The point you will still miss
The point you will still miss

We are not starting up again
I'm reaching higher than you ever can
We are not starting up again
I'm reaching higher than you ever can

Just away with this mistake
All these mistakes I've made
All mistakes, all mistakes I have made

Nothing will hold us save

I feel so damn short changed
And I hope there is more I can say
I don't need your help
I got this far all by myself
You're welcome
