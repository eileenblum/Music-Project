All life is lost, the time has come
All the love has gone
I'm all alone, the only one
I am your last son

Look at us, who we've been and what we've become
Shadows in a universe without a sun

Is there anyone, anyone, is there anyone left with me
Is there anyone out there tell me if you hear me
I am lonely, broken, I am so alone out here
Tell me where I need to go, tell me where you are right now

What is life without an aim
Everyday, the same
Forgot to care, we hunted fame
A never ending game

Everything we had is worthless now
Everything we need to survive somehow

Is there anyone, anyone, is there anyone left with me
Is there anyone out there tell me if you hear me
I am lonely, broken, I am so alone out here
Tell me where I need to go, tell me where you are right now

Dark wastelands overshadow every smile
Life is gone, life is lost
I'm a broken man in a broken place
Nobody won, we all lost instead

(Is there anyone, anyone, is there anyone left with me)
(Is there anyone out there tell me if you hear me)
I am lonely, broken, I am so alone out here
Tell me where I need to go, tell me where you are right now

(Anyone, anyone)
(Is there anyone, anyone)
Is there anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone
(Anyone, anyone)
(Is there anyone, anyone)
Is there anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone

Lost in space, no rebirth
An incurable scar
This is the place we called earth
A victim of war
