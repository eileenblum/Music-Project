[feat. Chris Fronzak of Attila]I hated it every time, the captain is still in my head
The shadow predicts the fall, one last war and then never again
My back to the wall, my back to the wall foreseeable when
Can I compete, can I compete, can I have permission?

To dream, come clean, you are the problem
To dream, come clean, you are the problem
You're the solution, you are the problem
You're the solution, you are the problem

Find a quiet spot, take your best shot
A private paradise, your private paradise

When life is too long
When life is too long but still too short
(Still too short)

I hated you every time but I never wanted you more
Drinking the poison itself straight from the lips of a whore
Slowly I drown, slowly I drown, down in the back of the well
The poison itself, a chemical mess, burning a hole in my head

To dream, come clean, you are the problem
To dream, come clean, you are the problem
You're the solution, you are the problem
You're the solution, you are the problem

Find a quiet spot, take your best shot
A private paradise, your private paradise

Let's go
I'm counting away the days
And it's almost as if life is wasting away
And I'm dying inside and I'm killing myself
Just to fill in a void that can never be filled
Why I'm just a sucker for habits
I'm ruining everything that I've loved
Over and over
The process destroying my mind
And a soul I can never get back
You are the problem
It's never gonna change

Find a quiet spot, take your best shot
A private paradise, your private paradise

(Paradise)
(Paradise)
