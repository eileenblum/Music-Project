You can find me at the same tree in the forest of the dead
The same day every year when the leaves grow red

You can find me at the same tree in the forest of the dead
The same day every year when the leaves grow red

Don't leave me a letter you can say it to my face
Don't tell me you're dying to make the world a better place

Life
A sacred gift from your mother
Life
What are you giving her back

There is no you and I in suicide
'Cause your pain won't die
Your pain won't die with you
You're just passing it on
Your pain won't die with you
You're just passing it on
Your pain won't die with you

Don't leave me a letter you can say it to my face
Don't tell me you're dying to make the world a better place

And she's there at the same tree in the forest of the dead
The same day every year when the leaves grow red
(When the leaves grow red)

Life
A sacred gift from your mother
Life
What are you giving her back

There is no you and I in suicide
'Cause your pain won't die
Your pain won't die with you
You're just passing it on
Your pain won't die with you
You're just passing it on
Your pain won't die with you

You're killing so much more
You're killing so much more than you
More than you

You're killing so much more
You're killing so much more than you
With all the lovesick drowning in the sea of trees

There is no you and I in suicide
'Cause your pain won't die
Won't die with you

There is no you and I in suicide
'Cause your pain won't die
Your pain won't die with you
Your pain won't die with you
Your pain won't die with you
