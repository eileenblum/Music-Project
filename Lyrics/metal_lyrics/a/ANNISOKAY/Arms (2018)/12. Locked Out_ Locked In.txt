I am locked out, I am locked in
The final nail in the coffin
Underwater or under the sky
I don't know how, I don't know why

If we started again from the very beginning
I'd still miss you, I'd still miss you
A different path to the very same heartstrings
That now form a noose, that now form a noose

Passion becomes a prison
And I'm trying to relive what I no longer feel
Freedom is not free (not free)
An apocalypse in heaven for me

Slipping away from you
Right through the bars of our prison cell
I am locked out, I am locked in
Holding the final nail for the coffin

(The ashes of my energy)
(Bring me to my misery)

(If we started again with the same old delusions)
(I'd still believe them, I'd still believe them)
In my head, we're tied by the very same heartstrings
That pull me straight down

Passion becomes a prison
And I'm trying to relive what I no longer feel
Freedom is not free (not free)
An apocalypse in heaven for me

Slipping away from you
Right through the bars of our prison cell
I am locked out, I am locked in
Holding the final nail for the coffin

(The ashes of my energy)
(Bring me to my misery)
(The ashes of my)
(Bring me to my)

Slipping away from you
Right through the bars of our prison cell
I am locked out, I am locked in

Slipping away from you
Right through the bars of our prison cell
I am locked out, I am locked in
Holding the final nail for the coffin

Getting away from you
Right through the bars of our prison cell
I am locked out, I am locked in
Holding the final nail for the coffin
