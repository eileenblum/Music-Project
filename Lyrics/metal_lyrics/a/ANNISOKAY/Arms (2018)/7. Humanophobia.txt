(It's humanophobia)

It's a feeding frenzy 'cause fear makes money
And if you're dealing in fear you're gonna need some enemies
(Need some enemies)

So find me an enemy
Find me an enemy

You can not kill kings to flush out the jacks
You, you can not kill kings to flush out the jacks
(Flush out the jacks)

And you would raze whole cities, even poison the sun
For the few bad men who never loved anyone

(It's humanophobia)

We need more money
So we're making fear
But the fear needs a name
And the fear needs a face

Don't blame a whole race for the few sick fucks
Who never learned shit and never loved anyone
(Never loved anyone)

You can not kill kings to flush out the jacks
You, you can not kill kings to flush out the jacks
(Flush out the jacks)

And you would raze whole cities, even poison the sun
For the few bad men who never loved anyone

(It's humanophobia)

Most humans never kill anyone, never kill anyone, anyone, anyone
Most humans never kill anyone, never kill anyone
(Never kill anyone)

And you would raze whole cities, even poison the sun
For the few bad men who never loved anyone
And you would raze whole cities, even poison the sun
For the few bad men who never loved anyone

(It's humanophobia)
