Head under water
So easy to get lost
No need to bother
Expect the worst
Keep my head under water
'Til I'm unconscious
Let's count the seconds together
'Til my heart is at rest

I am on the way to the dead
One, two, three, four
A rush of blood to the head
Five, six, seven, eight, stop

You think it's just a second in a world of time
But how much is it when it comes to dying
One second can decide about now or never
Will you stay or go, nothing lasts forever
(Nothing lasts forever)

Driving down the avenue out of town
Which is the tree for you, let's count them down
Driving through the night
Straight through red traffic lights
Should I grip the wheel tight
Or should I just let go

Do you ever think of staying underwater
Eight, seven, six, five
What is it that keeps me from doing it
Four, three, two, one, stop

You think it's just a second in a world of time
But how much is it when it comes to dying
One second can decide about now or never
Will you stay or go, nothing lasts forever

It's the heaviest choice to cross the dark line
(Cross the dark line)
'Cause every time I try you stay there and shine
It's the heaviest choice because you're in my mind
(You're in my mind)
Every time I try diving into the black water void

You light me up
(You light me up)
In these dark times
You light me up
(You light me up)
In these dark times
(In these dark times)
