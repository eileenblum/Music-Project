In a rundown store at the edge of town
They sold a gun called Columbine, called Columbine
It's been a long, long time since I held a gun
It's been a long time since the West was won, since the West was won

But I need protection
From people like me
It becomes an infection
Becomes a disease

It's been a long time since I held a gun
To the head of a man in the name of love
It's been a long time since a bullet flew
From the laws that were passed by the powers that be

It's the same old store where they proudly sold
The gun that shot John Lennon down, shot Lennon down
It's the same old news when the kids that go
Off to school don't make it home, don't make it home

But I need protection
From people like me
It becomes an infection
Becomes a disease

It's been a long time since I held a gun
To the head of a man in the name of love
It's been a long time since a bullet flew
From the laws that were passed by the powers that be

In the land of the free
In the land of the free

You could go fully automatic
Give me all that cash
You could go fully automatic
Give me all that cash
You could go fully automatic
Give me all that cash
Fully automatic

As an American, this is my right
As an American, this is my right
(This is my right)

It's been a long time since I held a gun
It's been a long, long time since the West was won

It's been a long time since I held a gun
To the head of a man in the name of love
It's been a long time since a bullet flew
From the laws that were passed by the powers that be
