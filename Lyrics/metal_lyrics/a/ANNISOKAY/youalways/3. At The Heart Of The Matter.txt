at the heart of the matter
just take a closer look
make it easy cause it is
it's all black and white when the music stops
it ends, so it begins

sometimes I think I understand

everyday I know that
I may be closer to
to something beautiful
you are tomorrow in today
and you will ever be

the you I know is fading away
no guts, no glory
the you I know is fading away
just stand up and be counted

can't say goodbye to somebody you don't know
so it begins, so it ends

I think I ... understand
sometimes I think I understand
