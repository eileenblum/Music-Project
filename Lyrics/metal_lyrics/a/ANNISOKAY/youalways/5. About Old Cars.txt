all my life I was running away
but the sad part is I'm still here
where did I go wrong all along
now I can leave my things behind
cause it's all going off without me

now the time has come
to clear the air and hit the road
damn what we wait for
I've got no time to lose

driving in my old car
mind out!
maybe our backlight has gone
for sure we're already drove too far
just leave my grave undone

listen to the voice in the radio
the tragedy starts from the very first spark

all good things come from above
I'm tired from being put off
I didn't really know how to call it
a name to conjure with
you're a little bit more then I thought you'd be

and now you're drowning me
and get lost in the sea
lost in an ocean
