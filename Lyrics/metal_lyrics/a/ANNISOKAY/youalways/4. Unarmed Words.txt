allow me to join your presence
no need to argue even for one second
oh what a beautiful view

the beauty in your eyes
the warmth of your smile
a heart of perfection

I would fight the darkest roads
to protect your shining eyes
these are my unarmed words
but I'm not the one
you're looking at
still I did
but doesn't arise

please don't worry about me
I'm already lost, I'm already gone
but you don't love me and I do too
I wish I could
I thought you would

this oppressed soul of mine
got no tears for long time

this is getting wrong
just bear it up and say the truth
as early as your eyes do
this moment will race forever
