my mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run, run, run
playing out my very last chance to run

taking me down off this cross
lay me down in the dust
where my eyes cant't see
no more sober words of love

this is my last chance to run
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
to live, to be alive
just run, run, run

take a look in the mirror

my mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run, run, run
playing out my very last chance to run

my last chance to run, my last chance
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
the mirror tells me
all I need to know
so I forget it after all

it's all for you
but somehow I my not stop
so I stopped smiling
so I stopped breathing

in all that you did
in all what you are
here I stand
where my past is as far as the sun
