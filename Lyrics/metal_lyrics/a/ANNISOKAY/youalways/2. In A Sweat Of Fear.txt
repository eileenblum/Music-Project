in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything

in my head I say your name slowly
for this point in time
I will stop my heart and I'll wait for, I'll wait for you
my life is going to cave in

in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything

when you move your hand over my back
this could be the very last time
the very last moment
one moment from somewhere else

only for you
the bright lights shine
but the truth is I am lost for words
and I will stop my heart, stop my heart and I'll wait for, I'll wait for you
my life is going to cave in
