living our lives in full profusion
restraint is no alternative solution
deforest, produce, consume and waste

you never ask what is at stake?
you never ask what to protect or to take

whitewash the misery of the poor
everyone else is the evil do-er

no ambition to be fair
true to the motto: What do I care?
mountains of stuff
enough is not enough

let us destroy the world
it's all useless and old
we can destroy the world
and feed children with gold

the floor starts to crack bit by bit
never mind who pays for it
deforest, produce, consume
we are affected in every way
we are affected when clouds
turn from white to grey

suddenly you're wide-awake
when you see what is at stake
