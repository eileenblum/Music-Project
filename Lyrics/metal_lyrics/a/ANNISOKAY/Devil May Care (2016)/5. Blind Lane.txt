we are in line we are the trend
brushed and forgotten in the end
across the years we've lost each other
blinded by a softly southern

I touch your skin
I hold my breath
the time has come
our love is dead
I watch the train
as it dissolves in heavy rain
on tracks out of the blind lane

from the heaven of together to the earth of alone
change your world before it kills you
there is no doubt this is what it's all about

I'm losing sleep
you're on my mind
I'm losing days
that I cannot find
there's nothing wrong
with being wrong for each other
at some time or another

when it's all said when it's all done
we give up before it even begun
when it's all cold, when it's all gone
we stand still, even if we try to run

there's nothing wrong
with being wrong for each other
