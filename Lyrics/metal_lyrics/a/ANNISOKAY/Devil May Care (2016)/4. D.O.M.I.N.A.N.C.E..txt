d.o.m.i.n.a.n.c.e.
why do we need this dominance
are we people of no consequence
who disregard each others dignity
Breeding this instability

what choice do we have?
we have all suffered so much

what choice do we have?
we have all suffered so much
The wells all have ran dry
Hearts are numb to the touch
Out in the cold
There is nowhere left to go
The ends drawing near
We need to shatter this state of fear

let's keep an eye on
the values that are not easy to try on
Burning bridges we have gone too far
I can finally see how blind we are

d.o.m.i.n.a.n.c.e.

the longer they keep talking
the less sense they will make

what choice do we have?
we have all suffered so much
The wells all have ran dry
Hearts are numb to the touch
Burning bridges we've gone too far
I can finally see how blind we are

They overstep the limits
They always miss the mark
They overstep the limits
their souls have grown so dark

no more d.o.m.i.n.a.n.c.e.
