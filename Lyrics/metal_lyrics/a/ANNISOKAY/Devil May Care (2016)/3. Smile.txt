[feat. Marcus Bridge of Northlane]why oh why
you cannot take it with you when you die
sometimes the things you want the most
won't happen until the book is closed
I'm losing all I have but sadly
not what I've ever wanted
tonight everything is over

if I told you reasons why
you would leave so I chose to lie
things have changed
I try my best to smile
why oh why

I'm afraid of getting colder
I am homeless in my home
miles away from where I was
sometimes the things you want the most
won't happen until the book is closed
I'm afraid of getting colder
cause tonight everything is over
clearly things have changed
cause they always do
how can I be sure
I try my best to smile
just for a little while
