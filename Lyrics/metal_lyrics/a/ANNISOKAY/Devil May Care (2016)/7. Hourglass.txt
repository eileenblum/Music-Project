the news is on, the sound's turned down
children running, screaming for help
all these victims, in this far away town

you think you can explain everything
you think you can explain
anything and everything

you know I know
nothing has changed
we still hurt each other
They know we know
nothing will change
is it too late to save your brother

point the gun and pull the trigger
you have not learned a thing
you have not learned anything

no one is welcome here
so blind we can't see
a vision blurred by the ones
who don't take this seriously
we're in the eye of the storm
that's spreading the poison with no the remedy
the world needs water to live
the world needs air to breathe

you think you can explain everything
you think you can explain
anything and everything
