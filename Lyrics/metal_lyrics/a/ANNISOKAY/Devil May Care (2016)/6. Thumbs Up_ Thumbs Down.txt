[feat. Christoph Von Freydorf of Emil Bulls]enter the arena
life's Colosseum is to bleed
crosskill of doom takes its toll in disguise
some things happen for no reason
when tragedy is running at full speed
face your demise in the blink of an eye
is this the way it goes
we can shatter in an instant
no matter who we are
we face our own demise
in the blink of an eye
thumbs up thumbs down

as soon as you walk this planet
don't take anything for granted, but fear
face your demise in the blink of an eye
the wildest rivers of joy
open out into a sea of tears
we've seen it a million times before
thumbs up thumbs down
it's spare or slay
you don't have to be brave
you don't have to be strong
you just have to be born
and you're trapped
