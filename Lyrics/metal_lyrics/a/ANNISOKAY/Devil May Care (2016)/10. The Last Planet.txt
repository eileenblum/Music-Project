as we drift across the universe
as we run away from a suffocating curse
the last planet
found by the alone for the alone
the last planet
made by the alone for the alone

lost here in space
our past is gone with no trace
And this reality is finally clear
when everything I love just disappears

if I could take you to the stars
on a mission even further from mars
I'll show you peace, I know it's true
cause no one knows how far we've travelled to break through

all we have is the here and now
these moments will dissolve
don't just sleep, please dream somehow
to know you is to leave you

the last, last planet
the lost, lost planet

as we sail into the universe
as we say goodbye to our dying earth
If I could take you to the stars
on our mission even further from mars
I'll show you peace, I know it's true
cause no one knows how far we've travelled to break through

cause no one knows how far we've travelled to break through
free from the laws of gravity
there is no sound in the emptiness
I was lost but now I'm found
