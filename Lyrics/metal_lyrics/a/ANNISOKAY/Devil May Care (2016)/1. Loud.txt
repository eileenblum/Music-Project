we've ruined everything, a dream designed to fall
the world won't mourn us when we're
dead and gone, dead and gone
accepting our fate, our backs against the wall
the cycle of destruction goes on and on

downtown is on fire
the final hour approaches you
caught in the headlights
guilty of murder
deep in you heart you know the truth

so scream it loud
Loud loud loud
scream the truth
if they don't listen scream it loud
Loud loud loud
scream the fucking truth

if your eyes are open
if your heart's not frozen
don't let it all disappear
cause all we have is here

who will shine the brightest of all
what will it take to break down these prison walls
we'll be the voice, alone in the crowd
If they're not listening scream it loud

essential dedication to the pace of life
open your eyes
how will we survive

deep in you heart you know the truth
