naturally I expected nothing
it was still too much
we live our lives parallel side by side
never to touch never to touch

everywhere you were there
like a ghost in the thin air
it's not meant to end like this
it's not meant to end like this

I always knew what we could be
but there's only one path
there's only one path that holds you and me

too tired to sleep
too hungry to eat
let's just cut, cut ourselves
cut out of each others lives
cut out of each others heads
cut out of our photographs

falling in love with a cloud in the sky
all I can do is watch it float away
you were the umbrella that could keep me dry
now I'm drowning in the rain
as the world passes us by

too tired to sleep
too hungry to eat
let's just cut ourselves
cut out of each others lives
cut out of each others heads
cut out of our memories

I know that our sun has set
industrial light and magic
I'm staring at the face of my fear
trying to erase you but you're still here
