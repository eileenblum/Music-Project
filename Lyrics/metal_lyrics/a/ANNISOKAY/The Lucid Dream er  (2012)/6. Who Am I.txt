Who am I to force my destiny
No I am fine, I wait patiently
I have all the time in the world
Footloose and fancy free

Who am I to force my destiny

Again it seems we meet
I will take you out tonight
Your heart is beating faster and faster
The precious one underneath your bra

Who am I to force my destiny
No I am fine, I wait patiently

Drifting away into the night
You are right here, right next to me
I never want this night to end
Cause I've got all my time to spend

Some may believe
That someday there comes somebody nice
That one will change your life tremendously
To make it better in some degree

A taste of confidence in my mouth
Is more than I can say
There is only one thing that is sure
It is you that I adore
