[Verse:]
I need you to, I need you to feel the same
I need you to come here and save me
Come with me I will make you feel good
Feel like you really should

[Chorus:]
I guess you're finding your feet
I guess you're finding
I guess you're finding your feet

I only have myself to blame
There is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs so I write this songs
I was so confused, I was scared and bruised
Sometimes itâs not enough and the road gets tough

Silence is your sound but I prefer the bold and loud

[Chorus]

I am a wishing saint
I won't resist it
I will reside

I'm so crazy, I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
Trying to push past, but past saving
Was I always like this, adventure seeking, so restless
Silence is your sound but I prefer the bold and loud

[Verse]

Just let go of what you think you know
Your life will be sweet when youâre finally free
I will fly away, fly into the stars
I am a wishing saint
I won't resist it
I will reside
And that's where I become insane
