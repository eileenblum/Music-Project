Can you hear this sound?
Can you hear this noise?

Are you really alone?

[Verse:]
Your mind is staking out like mine was before
A cold wind is blowing through your house
It sounds like whispered lies
Your mind is staking out like mine was before
Did you make sure is somebody darkening your door?

[Chorus:]
This room is dead and cold
Is this still your home?
Did you leave the back door open?
What would you give to return to the fold

[Verse]

Just make yourself believe
That there is nobody under your bed
One wish for a divine spark
They won't follow you into the dark

[Chorus]

This could have been your last act
