We all have stories that we will never tell
From the bottom line fear is the heart of hell
I was down and out but the world did not fall apart
And now there is not a single thing to frown about

You know my name but not my story
You know everything Iâve done
You know my name but not what I have been through

[Chorus:]
By the time you want me to be in your life again
By the time you will understand that I will be gone again

Life is too awesome to waste your time away
Someday this pain will make sense to you
I was down and out
But the world did not fall apart
And now there is not a single thing to frown about
You want me to be in your life again
But I will be in someone elseâs

[Chorus]
