My time, my time won't run away tonight
The ghost of me will disappear without a light

Time will not, will not run away tonight
The ghost of me will disappear without a light

Things get misunderstood
In the time of my dying
It doesn't feel like flying

I am blaming me but itâs alright
Just can't see anything without a light

[Chorus:]
You never ask me to lie
I never ask you to cry
You never ask me to lie
I see it in your eyes I feel it in your touch

Lying in the darkness of this dead end street
I cannot run away cause this is my world
There will never be a brand new you and me
You never ask me

[Chorus]

No matter when I wanna see you, see you again
It's all good and it's gonna be alright
Say you will and shoot the light
My shadow will fade away
But the ghost of me can stay
