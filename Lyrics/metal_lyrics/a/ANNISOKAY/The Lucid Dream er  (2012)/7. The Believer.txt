I remember becoming a believer
I remember when my heart has caught the fever
I mean after all the things we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into

So it just hurts my soul
I may never know
How I feel for you

You walk around like you don't know me
Youâre just pushing me down, pushing me down
To my surprise a fuck is my replacement
The biggest douch bag in this town

And I know that love is mean

I know that I cared but it was never enough
I know I was there but it was never near enough

When my eyes are wet and sore I can't see you anymore
When I never see your face again
My world would be such a better place

(I still remember)
It ain't complicated, I've grown to hate it
(Say you'll remember)
Does it make you feel good, knowing that you could

And I know that love is mean, and I know that love hurts
But I still remember, say you will remember
