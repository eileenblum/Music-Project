Everybody's gonna be afraid sometimes
And itâs the right time to be
Itâs the right time to be
For one final time
Just be brave, just be strong
Do not surrender and get along

Do you remember what you told me once?

This could be your last act without a happy ending
Itâs not a gothic tale this is tonight

I don't want to sleep anymore
Almost shaken to the core
Shut out what they say
This dream is fucked up anyway

[Chorus:]
I tried to tell myself what to dream what to forget
And now I try wake up cause all hell is let loose

You will find an answer, you will find the truth
Because there is so much to answer there is so much to do
For one final time
Just be brave, just be strong
Do not surrender and get along

Do you remember what you told me once?

[Chorus]

I will take a fire walk with you
We will bring off a coup
I promised I'd see this with you now

[Chorus]
