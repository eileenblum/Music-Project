They will be back again
They will be back in the night
You won't escape again with no more than a fright

I need a cover, I need a shelter
I need you to pretend we're really strong
All the safety will be gone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Before the darkness gets a chance to bite
Sing me a song and hold me tight
I am now where I have been
And I see what I've already seen

[Chorus:]
Cause this is a nightmare this is not a dream
You will scream, you have to scream
I think I have gone monstercrazy
You will scream, you have to scream

From darkness into the light
We have survived, a narrow escape
Out of the jaws of death
One moment that takes your breath

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

A cry
Under the screen of the dark
A scare, a chase, a mystery
Like a child I stay up in fright
Stay up all night

So don't wonder what it was
These shadows called your name
And nothing will be the same

They will be back again

You will scream, you have to scream
This is not a dream this is a nightmare
They will be back again in the night
You won't escape again with no more than a fright
