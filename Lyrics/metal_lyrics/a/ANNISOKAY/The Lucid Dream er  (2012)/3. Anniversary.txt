Dropped by the wayside
All what was left is done
The past is a lie
So don't you forget it

My first note in every song I sang
In every line I wrote
Let me tell you you're the sweetest thing
In every line I wrote in every song I sang

It's like falling in love
It's like falling in love to a break up song
But there is no way of knowing

Don't get me wrong
My first note in every line wrote
In every song I sing
Have you forgotten what youâve seen
Trying to wipe the slate clean

It is me on that road
With your heir in my hand
On my way to nowhere
Till I am where we have never been

On my way to nowhere
Till I am where we have never been

Dropped by the wayside
