Before you judge me take a good hard look at yourself
You don't know me but you're draining me of mental health
A lie based on popular opinion
I want to die 'cause I can't be forgiven

Locked in a room
Void of humanity
I'm in a black hole
Suffering endlessly
Opening my eyes is worse than death
That's why I keep on holding my breath

The world is caving in all around me
I see myself as a vulgar monstrosity
My mind collapsed into a technical mess
I can't deal with the guilt that I have to ingest

Locked in a room
Void of humanity
I'm in a black hole
Suffering endlessly
Opening my eyes is worse than death
That's why I keep on holding my breath

Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath
Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath
Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath
Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath

Worse than death â¦ Holding my breath
Worse than death â¦ Holding my breath

Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath
Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath
Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath
Opening my eyes worse than death â¦ Why I keep on holding my breath
