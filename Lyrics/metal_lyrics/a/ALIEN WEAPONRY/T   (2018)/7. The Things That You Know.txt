Start the game all over again
Redo it and regain myself
Perfection is not without consequence put your mediocrity on the shelf
Normal things are safe and easy
Get a life and go
Do what you're comfortable with
Do the things that you know
The things that you know
It's hard to let go of the things that you know
Life must be boring be good and you get your pay
All people who succeed must listen to what
The government has to say
We must go cleanse ourselves
Of happiness
It's the government
To whom we pray the things that you know
It's hard to let go of the things that you know
The things that you know
It's hard to let go of the things that you know
