Flickering screens against glassy dead eyes
Have now become the norm
They live their lives through others' eyes
Willing more and more
That you lose to the pressure

The watching eyes of the masses
Kill common sense
The media rules you
They are bored with your life
You need to make it right
To satisfy the fixated idiots that
See your every move
See your every move
See your every move

When will they see
That your life is a lie
When will they see
Your life is a lie

Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie

Yeah, your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie

Yeah, your life is a lie
Life is a lie
Life is a lie
Life is a lie

Just one big fucking lie
