Thought that you would just keep it to yourself
But you had to spread the rumours and piss me off
I fill with hate and distrust
You are the preacher of your own future
Rage it takes over again
And I have to accept
I can't control it
I can't control it
Rage takes over again
I know he will be easy prey
I challenge him you just couldn't keep your mouth shut
Now everyone knows
You just couldn't restrain yourself but to piss me off
You just couldn't keep good attention yours you just caused yourself pain
Ignorance on both our parts
Our egos need to grow we want to win the fight
We want control
Te ihi (The drawing of breath through flared nostrils)
Te wehi (The adrenaline)
Te wana (The fearless trembling)
