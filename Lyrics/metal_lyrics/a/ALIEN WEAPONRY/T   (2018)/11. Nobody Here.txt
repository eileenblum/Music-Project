Everyone watching but there's nobody here
Nau mai ki te rua ipurangi au (Welcome to the abyss that is the internet)
Ehara i te wÄhi whakaruruhau (it's not a place of safety)
He karu pÅtÄtÄ (Eyes deliberately closed)
Ka whakahÄ«hÄ« tonu koe (Your vanity reigns)
Te ao mÄrama ngaro (The real world lost)
O rite ki te pÅ (Like the darkness)
Te rorohiko (The computer)
He tÄku kÄinga pono (Is my true home)
Sometimes I wonder if the world is real
Real
Real everyone watching but there's nobody here
We all just close our eyes and look inside
Reality sinks away
Reality sinks away
Everyone watching but there's nobody here
Nobody here
