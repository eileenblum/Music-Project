With eyes so dark and grey
This life will fade away
With the setting sun
The end is growing near

[Chorus]
I don't know when it's my time
As darkness fades to grey
I put off my last dream
But there won't be another day
We think we all have time
Before we all depart
But waiting only means
You'll leave this world with a broken heart

I miss my kids, my life, my wife
Do they know the way I feel
Will I be forgot
Will they know how I cared
