You see the morning sun
But you can't be the one
They built around it
But you can't wait 

As you fall deep and far
You see a shooting star
They built around you
But you can't wait

Hope is the only one
If you fail, it will run 
It fell around you
It's too late

Hope is always there
When all that's left is despair
Hope will rain on you
And soon you'll need hope too

[Chorus]
Hope is the only one 
who can't escape the bitter fate
It's waiting there for you for you to hold
The bitter cold, the one you wanted
You can feel it's warm embrace
It's weary face you're much too late and
it is looking down at you, you think you had 
The one you wanted

You can walk the ring of fire
The one you lost, it's your desire
You can't break free 
You're bound by fate

It reaches out to you
It wants to rule you too
You can't break free
You're bound by fate

You try to turn away
It's with you til the grave
It fell around you
You're bound by fate
