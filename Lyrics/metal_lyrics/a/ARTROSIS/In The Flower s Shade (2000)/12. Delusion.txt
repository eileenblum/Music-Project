In the old stairway
In the streams of rain
Your love is imprisoned
It's got only one queen
Golden heart
You laid at its feet
Had cracked before you understood
It will destroy you
With each step
With each gesture
It will destroy you
With each word
Bewitched by its melody
You drink off sounds
Deluded by a failure
You tempt fortune
From joy to suffering - short way
You'll defeat it
Though you know the end
