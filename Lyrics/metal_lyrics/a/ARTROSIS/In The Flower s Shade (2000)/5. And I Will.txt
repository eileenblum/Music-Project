Touch me and I'll fly up over you like rainbow
Take all you want
Let the world spin with the colours of your sounds
Touch me and I'll
Unseen glitter closes my eyes again
Brightens up
Let the world spin with the colours of the night
Touch me and I'll
Touch me and I'll ...
Let the world spin
Unseen glitter...
Touch me and I'll...
