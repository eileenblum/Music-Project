I've found myself inside you
I know I've got different blood
This is not the same
Differently I feel dread
I drift in loneliness
Wind blows far between
I scarcely catch up with waves
Whose shape
I close in my hands
Be!
Be by my side
Then everything will start again
Take and hide me
/Be/cause  I exist only for you
Among the flowers and shadows
Among the vapours wrapping thoughts
I know!
My garden will disappear
Everything will start again
From untouched sorrow
Silence covers with tears
I'm taken in by its scream
I return to the past, and there
I drift in loneliness
Wind blows far between
I scarcely catch up with waves
Whose shape
I close in my hands
Be!
Be by my side
Then everything will start again
Take and hide me
/Be/ cause  I exist only for you
Among the flowers and shadows
Among the vapours wrapping thoughts
I know!
My garden will disappear
Everything will start again
