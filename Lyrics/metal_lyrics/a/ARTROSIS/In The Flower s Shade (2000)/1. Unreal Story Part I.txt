I'm your flower and shadow
I blossom and fade
Quiet of bliss governs
My mouth - red
Silver fog surrounds me
You're night and she's shadow of the earth
Along which I pace
Unreal world
Unreal we are
Unreal story
I painted pictures with my tears
Like passing days
Unreal people
Unreal events
Unreal we are
