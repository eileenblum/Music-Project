Truth and deceit turned into words
Waves into my story
Whose sense is understood only by me
My game is over
Quietly the gilt is off
I'll close fire under my eyelids
I'll start to write the following chapter
/the following/
Voice of false confessions
Lies down on my mouth
Although I don't want to
I'm walking away with each new moment
Swimming in bursting stream of words
I want to write the following chapter
