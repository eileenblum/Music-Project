Your town is ill
You are the only one who lives there
It's alive but empty
There are white nights and black days
Imagination and dreams are ragged
Halter is tightened moving shadow rises
You know it well
Two different ways lead up and down
The right one you have to choose by yourself
Different orders from the heart and mind
Feelings in heart, mind lacks for commonsense
You believed too hard
Listening to the words without emotion
Being fed on illusion
You took notice only of what says
Your soul
Your master
You god
You know the one thing
You gave yourself for him
You give your blood for him
Possessed by your angel
You pace proudly downwards
You chose that way
Along the stony route
Red water
