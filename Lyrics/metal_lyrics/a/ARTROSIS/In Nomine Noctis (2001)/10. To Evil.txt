You are more than shadow that breaks the light
Finish up your song!
For her - mad scream is a verse
Cry is a refrain
Finish up your song and be silent!
You are more than pain - it disappears with time
Finish up your dance!
You change quiet ballet of life into death's pirouette
Finish up your dance!
