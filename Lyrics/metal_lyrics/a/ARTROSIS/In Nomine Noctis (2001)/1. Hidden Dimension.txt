Sorrow of enchanted thoughts
Fist of enchanted words - still does a harm
Mirror of enchanted love - reflects the remains of feelings of degraded
hearts
Of all those fallen souls
Of all lost angels souls, of fused wings' flutter
Of all condemned souls
Of all those who wish for entering
Dimension hidden
Invisible colours, black waterfalls
Dimension hidden
Inviolable statues of deities
Dimension hidden
You stand in the middle looking for your way
Dimension hidden
Night of enchanted shadows - is black from fear and anxiety
Their existential purpose is to reach gates of silence
Of all those fallen souls
Of all lost angels souls, of fused wings' flutter
Of all condemned souls
Of all those who wish for entering
Dimension hidden
