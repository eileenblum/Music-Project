Night's quest for day is eternal ceaseless
In the name of night you leave us on the edge of day
Giving yourself you leave as well
Towards night
Still towards night
For ever and ever amen
Above your head - shadow of golden letters
But it is too vast to be understood
Towards night
Still towards night
For ever and ever amen
