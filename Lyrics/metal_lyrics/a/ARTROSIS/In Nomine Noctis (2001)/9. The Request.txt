Rock me - in sound which alleviate the pain
- In sound that drifts like a cloud
In the sky among bright stars
Whose sheen will grasp fear
I feel it!
It leaves sing in my made of clay body
- It is fragile although hard
I feel it!
Somewhere it takes breath, servers the air
Help me to comprehend the void
That's hidden in the interior of stones
This is time that brought about covering my eyes with chill
I see colours no more
He is the abyss of thousand dreams
He makes me cry
I feel him!
He sings to me again
