I would like
To forget about all those fatal days
To abandon myself utterly to hypnosis
To feel the hunger of words whose saving taste
Will let survive
Get gradually in
And find the sing of pain
Let remains of evil dreams consumed by fire
Look around!
Breathe in air with all yourself
Synthetic thoughts will take your breath
Turn back from infinity of fatal space
Breathe life in fables' world
Let remains of evil dreams consumed by fire
As light is being put out, dreams are going by
Silence your breath slowly
Free yourself from the black dates
Let remains of evil dreams consumed by fire
