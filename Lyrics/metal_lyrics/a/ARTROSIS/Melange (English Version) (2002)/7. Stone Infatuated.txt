While thinking of her
You keep repeating stony words
Silence - all around -
Doesn't help you forget

The blind fate throws what you've got into the abyss of love
Senseless is your attempt to win with the feeling

A new idea lights the fire
You want to remain a slave
Emptiness, inside you,
Desperate wish to sort it out

The blind fate throws what you've got into the abyss of love
Senseless is your attempt to win with the feeling
