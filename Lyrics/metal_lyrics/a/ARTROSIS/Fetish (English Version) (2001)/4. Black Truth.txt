In the eyes of looking truth is a picture
Lie glitters with gold
Uttered words
Will not express
Your feelings, thoughts and wisdom

Black truth
Golden lie
Burns in heart
Thorn wrapped in velvet
Wounds deeper and deeper
Silence drinks in colourful memories
quicker and quicker
He is gone

You fight off
Venom that flows from the mouth
Black truth
Golden lie - leaves
Black truth - remains
