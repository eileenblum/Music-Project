Insatiable with your symbol
I seek a refuge in the depths of thoughts
Like a road dreaming about a nomad
I raise hands to you

In front of you - granite king
Another god appears
As power without throne
Vein without light
Shadow

The night arose from the scraps of hours
Lured by calling of the pale moon
You chose her and only she
Adorns her temples with the crown of roses

In front of you - granite king
Another god appears
As power without throne
Vein without light
Shadow

What about me granite king?
I ask quietly although I know
That this is you - power without throne
Vein without light
