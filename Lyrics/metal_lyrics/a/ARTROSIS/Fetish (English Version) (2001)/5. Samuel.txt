From the mouth's depth starving for sound
A quiet tone is being born
You feel stronger
Turned into silence - you know
You are alone again
Time gives no answer
Beyond eyelids tied with dream
Medley of pictures plays
The rhythm of ferocious melody
Throbs in temples
Unique spells
Lose their charm irretrievably

At the heart's bottom the circle you shape
From your enveloped in mist wishes
You plunge your hand in illusions' lake
Because in its depths - alleviation
