Sewn with thin thread words - wind round the shape of stone mouth
Abandoned gestures
You come first then me
Deafened with the song of senses you steal something I do not want to give
Fortunes told by cards
You come first then me
A dream faded away
You and me
Two sides of a mirror
Two different ways
Two different words

Somewhere there - another me
Poisoned, forgotten
Starving for memories
Affected - me
