Emerald night
In a crystal castle
Waking up, falling asleep
Always in each other's arms

Empty eyes are full of lies
But I still keep loving you like thousand suns

And thousand roses are in fairy bloom
And thousand roses of gold
Unfold their magic dreams
In the emerald night in the crystal castle
Where thousand roses are in fairy bloom
And thousand roses of gold unfold their magic dreams 
In the emeral night in the crystal castle
