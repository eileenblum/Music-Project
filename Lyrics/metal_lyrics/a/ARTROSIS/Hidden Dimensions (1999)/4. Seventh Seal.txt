Sleeping angels dream their eternal dreams
They'll never rise again to save you from the evil
Sleeping angels dreaming their dream

Spread on your hand Holy Book wide open
When your hand crushes the seal
This gonna be the last of the sunrsets
When the sward of the hunger of death

When the earth is crying
The sun is hiding its face 
Moon's bleeding in scarlet
When the last seal is breaking up 
Our time is coming
The sky is raining stars

When the earth is crying
The sun is hiding its face
Moon's bleeding in scarlet
When the last seal is breaking up
Our time is coming
The sky is raining stars
