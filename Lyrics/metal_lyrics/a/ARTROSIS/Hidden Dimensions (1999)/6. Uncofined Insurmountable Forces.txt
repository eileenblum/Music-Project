Unconfined Insurmontable Forces
Keep me burning, subsiding and longing
Through the winding days so many misfortunes
That the ominous wind's blowing towards me

Days are rising, pilling up and gliding
Over landscapes which inside are burning
Over scarlet, over water surging
Slowly drifting, heavy clouds are swirling

Clear sky behind the gate of branches
Sullen ground under creeping shadows
Heavy branches are like sins over souls
I can't hold the words, scuffing inside me
