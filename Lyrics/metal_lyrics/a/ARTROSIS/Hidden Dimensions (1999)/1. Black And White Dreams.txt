Reason of my silence lies in you
In my dream
Reason of my crime is only you
Reason of the pride I feel is you
In my dream
Reason of my inability

In jealously, down on my knees I'm bound to pay
For everything you've done
And never will see your face again
Tears running down

Reason of your silence lies in me
In your dream
Reason of your crime is only me
Reason of your pride you feel is me
In your dream
Reason of your inability

In jealously, down on my knees I'm bound to pay
For everything you've done
And so my dreams are always gonna stay in
Black and white
So long I have waited for the sign
Emotional desert you've become
To spring from which no water runs outside
Forever dreams of black and white
