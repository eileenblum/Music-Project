This ruthless dance keeps going on and on
Ballet of hearts
But only this make sense
It feels like dying when you go away
The moment you return 
I feel I live again

In the mirror of my deepest derams
I see your face reflected
I see my true desires
In your hands I lay my soul
Which tenderly caressing
Are sowing seeds of wrath
Seeds of wrath...

I fall asleep silenty so deep in your arms
To the rhythm of the waltz you caress me
And we dance
Dancing is divinty that you seek
It's redemption
Following your destiny till the end of existence
My deepest dreams...
