Who I am?
Who are you?
The things i desire are closer to me every day
But what if want something else
This dream, leads me through nightmares
Like it's the only chance to live my life

Was it a fear to talk or you just forgot it?
And now I wonder
Who should I call when I have some thoughts to say
When I need adviser

The world is crashing down
Because of one mistake
When one unanswered call
Could save our life for years

And I just want to know
What did you feel
When read that I'm alive

Who I am?
I am ghost
I am left inside your head
Keep me with every mistake that I've made

There're only fakes now
And their faces shine
I'm drowning but there's no regret
Behind the mask it's hard to realize
That there's nothing, there's an empty space

Just walk away from me
Cause I can't hold on
I can't stand strong now
And every time I hear this words of pity
I feel confused

Something inside my head
Tells me to go away
But memories tell me I have to stay
This game has no remorse
And titles have no names
I'm not afraid to lose
But I'm afraid to waste

I never wanted you to play this role
I never wanted you to be bad
I never wanted you to be the victim
And now I see you in this game
But you are a bad player, don't you?
Oh, my feelings tell you've gone to far

Who I am?
I am ghost
I am left inside your head
Keep me with every mistake that I've made
