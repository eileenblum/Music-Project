[Chorus:]
The rain has washed my tears away
(Washed my tears away)
But the colours are still grey
And I see this field
Where my brother took his last breath
And how can I come home now

(Don't you know?)
This sin will never let you be
I hope you know
(I hope you know)
And if you don't believe in God
I'll dig the ground to find your bones

We surrender this rage again
Though death is going round
And if you don't believe in God
Your way will end right now
You'll never come back
I'll never come back

[Chorus:]
The rain has washed my tears away
(Washed my tears away)
But the colours are still grey
And I see this field
Where my brother took his last breath
And how can I come home now

I can't believe
I wanna get home
Cause Lord I'm afraid
I'm afraid

Don't be such a girl
It's all the same till the end
This is our duty
We should defend our future

Life is not that kind of a thing
You can deprive, you can detract
I will save you image
I wanna look at your face
Your face

So when two sides collide
Everything goes not like in the movies
There's no conscience, no control
In front of you stands a man
And either you or he will die

[Chorus:]
The rain has washed my tears away
(Washed my tears away)
But the colours are still grey
And I see this field
Where my brother took his last breath
And how can I come home now

Forget, forget
They say, but how I can?
Forget, forget
Will keep until the end
