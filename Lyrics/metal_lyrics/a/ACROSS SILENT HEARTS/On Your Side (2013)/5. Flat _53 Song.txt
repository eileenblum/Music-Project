Waking up
(Oh shit)
I can't remember
Where the fuck I have fallen asleep
And who is laying next to me
What is your name, baby?
And who's your daddy?

This story has happend
With me and my friends

The brightest evening in my life
Has started only
With nothing left to lose
Not knowing when to stop
With nothing left to lose
Not knowing when to stop
I will never find my rest in peace

Through someone's eyes
I saw that place that evening
What has gave me to chills?
Her touch unexpected

God save me from myself

[Chorus:]
Seeing you in other light
Your limbs are so hot
My thoughts are so crazy
Hope your other boyfriend will forgive me
I am not the only
But maybe you were waiting for me
We're part of nature's plan

One, two, three, four
I can't count the glasses we drink

Another part of body
Takes me under control
Like I'm driving a train on rocks, yeah
There's no feeling of time
There's no blame at all
Every crime we make
Share the same goal

There's no feeling of time
There's no blame at all
There's no red light
Save me from the beast in my head
Waiting oh

The bitter morning taste
Flash in my mind, disgrace
What was before and now?
(Hahahaha)

[Chorus:]
Seeing you in other light
Your limbs are so hot
My thoughts are so crazy
Hope your other boyfriend will forgive me
I am not the only
But maybe you were waiting for me
We're part of nature's plan

There's enough time for us to taste it all
No sense to ask me
I won't call

Situations come and go
We've shared the bed
We've shared the floor
And now it's time
I bid you farewell and goodbye

Goodbye
I won't call

There's enough time for us to taste it all
But this time I have another girl to call
