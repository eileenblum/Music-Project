Welcome home
How long you were out?
The news are spread
You are all right

Welcome home
Do you remember?
We're your friends
But not this time

Have you ever felt the tension
of knowing you are unexpected
And everyone is looking at you
Like you are detached

I know we are not the same
The past has gone and you with it
Should I take it
or should I leave it?

The wounds i keep inside
Will find another way
I'm a captive
Flight's delayed
Don't say : "I'm sorry"
You are the victim
But don't understand

They thought that I could take this
That I'm left aside in past
And my visions are fading
But I'm never coming back
not coming back

And for the last time I will talk to you

Look, is there something else
we can compose about ourselves ?
Or we will stay apart without the truth?

Musing about it
I see the edge of it all
rains soak the grave
of promice that we broke

The time will judge, but don't need verdict
don't need verdict

They thought that I could take this
That I'm left aside in past
And my visions are fading
But I'm never coming back
Cause you're dead inside my head
and i'm not gonna pretend
all this fiction I'm sick of it
I see you are drowning

Another day it all will come back to you
Your payback is on the way
I've payed enough for it all
And your can keep the change
But you can't erase the fact
