All right
Our ship is ready to go
We'll sail across the space
To find another home
And leave the earth behind
And leave the earth behind

Gravitation can't break our plan
We've reached the speed enough to go
We've made decision let's not wait
My passion won't die

To touch the reverie
I live just one life
It is enough for me
My passion won't die

You thought I'm weak
But I am not afraid
The first step was made
And I'm ready to go
Until I reach the place
I won't give up
And sacrifice my friends

Take me, take me home
I wanna be just there
Make me, make me crawl
Seems I'm coming back
There's enough for everyone
But I share my world only with you tonight

Constellation of hope
The stars are close
I can touch them
And not to be hurt

I wanna take this feeling with me
Every light is an exception
Everybody wants to shine
But I'm sleeping without you
The galaxy of faith is calling me to go

You face, your eyes
I've seen it all before
One life, one chance
It's time to touch my dream

Take me, take me home
I wanna be just there
Make me, make me crawl
Seems I'm coming back
There's enough for everyone
But I share my world only with you tonight
The lights are down tonight
(The lights are down tonight)

It's more than kiss
It's trust and faith
love and warmth

Our ship is ready to go...
