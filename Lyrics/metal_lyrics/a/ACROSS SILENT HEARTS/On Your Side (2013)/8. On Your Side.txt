The mess we've made began to grow like a weed
I've tryed to come back said it clear
And tell me where have you been
When I needed you so much, my dear

Like a sick bird is dreaming of flying
Once have tasted love we were drunk
If I say I regret I will lie
How can I compare, I don't know

Can you tell, can you tell me now
How the ship we've built was sinking
I cut it all
The truth was not worth healing

Leaving behind one of this days
I ask myself when is almanac closing
Leaving behind one of this days
I've got enough, we need to go further

It's time to make step up, hope for the best

It's so cold and lonely now
Though someone is always near
I've said i'd never return
The only thing i feel is pain

Can't pretend, can't keep my smile again

I remember when you told once
Hope we'll never drift apart
Swear to God that i was sure
Always will be on your side

Seems nothing's left to say, only regrets
I'm drowning in sins that we've made
You know there's a poem I've wrote
I start again

Leaving behind one of this days
I ask myself when is almanac closing
Leaving behind one of this days
I've got enough, we need to go further
Though I'm far from you, but I'm on your side
But matter how hard it seems
But no matter how long it takes
We'll be all right I see this clear

Set me free
We are going on
But it's not the same
I hope it was worth it
But this time hope
For the best

I can breathe
I'm free of it
