I'm not insane

I hear the coming steps
I know
These habits they betray you

They use the masks
But veils won't disguise
White sheets, white walls
But thoughts are black
White sheets, white walls
I can't escape

[Chorus:]
Show me, show me all your fears
(Your fears)
I wanna to set you free
Show me, show me all your fears
(How does it feel?)
I'm not insane

Leave me alone, I beg

Never again
Time is slowing down
The walls are closing
The shelters are hard to find

Don't wanna wake up
This room has become my grave
Bromine has taken my pride
My hope has gone away

My mind plays tricks
Can't tear apart my sleeps
Tie me to bed and stick your will in me
But don't think I will obey

Every day we have a walk
It's the only time I live
And though don't wanna return
Can't break this deal

[Chorus:]
Show me, show me all your fears
(Your fears)
I wanna to set you free
Show me, show me all your fears
(How does it feel?)
I'm not insane

These days
I'm coming back to you

Can you help me wash my sins
Cause sometimes seems I don't live
And it's so easy to predict
And baby if you thought that you know me
But you were not right
You have no idea who I am

Grave
I have risen from the grave
