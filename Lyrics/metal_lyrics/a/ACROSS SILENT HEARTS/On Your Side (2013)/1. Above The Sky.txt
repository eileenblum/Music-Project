(Light in your eyes)
Light in your eyes
Will never fade for me
I know this is right
I know this is right
So who told you
That I am retreating
So who told you
That every story will end

Every time I'm going down I know
I know that I'm not alone
I know together we are strong
Every time I'm going down
We are going down together
And I think this is the best I've got
(Best I've got)
