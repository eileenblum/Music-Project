Constant fear in my plain emotions
To find myself...
To feel these shivers
Under the dead skin of mine

To breathe and to suffocate
To live alone
And to die alone
Calling of a great unknown
To find away...
To hide these scars

Under the light of coldness
Engrave my weak body
Bury this hopeless soul
Of a wanderer
Who once called the great unknown
