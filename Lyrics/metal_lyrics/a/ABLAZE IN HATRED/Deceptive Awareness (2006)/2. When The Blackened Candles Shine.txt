The moment of bizarre calmness
The tranquillity of morning dew
While my silvery tears drifts on these times

(My cold blade of sacred souls)
With a mission of pure slaughter

The moment of deceptive awareness
The blood of innocent ones
When the blackened candles shine

(My cold blade of sacred souls)
With a mission of pure slaughter

How I love to drown in this serene dreams
The dream of these who deserve to die
While my silvery tears drift on these times
