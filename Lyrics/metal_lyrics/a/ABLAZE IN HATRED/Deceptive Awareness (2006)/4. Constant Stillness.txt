Feels like these walls are my final home
The only haven of this cruel and captured mind
Constantly this time runs over me
And I will be buried with this stillness of mine

Could my heart be any weaker?
Of these silent dreams
Of these flowing thoughts
When the absence overtakes me

Seems like these doors are shut forever
No light... nothing...
Constantly this time runs over me
And I will be buried with this stillness of mine

Could my heart be any weaker?
Of these silent dreams
Of these flowing thoughts
When the absence overtakes me
