One night I made myself strong
Visions clear like the haunting air
Honoured by the life
Which gave me so much

All this was just a glimpse of joy
Now everything feels the same
And I am almost
Died and vanished
Drowning soul
In a broken man

Obsessions are too strong
In this ongoing fall
Soon this autumn is mine
Enduring dreams of losing
Silent mist calls the mortal
So lovely to be
Died and vanished
