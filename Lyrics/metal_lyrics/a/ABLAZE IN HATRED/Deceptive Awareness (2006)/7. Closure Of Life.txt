Finally...
You will see the day
Which gives the flickering of nothing
Deceased by this irrelevant world
Sorrow fills this bright air
Feel the cold on your skin

It is time to call the moaner
Of your bereavement
Helpless are the steps
So long is the path
To your death
To the closure of life

Horrors are forgotten
Everything is forgiven
The eternal sleep
Take your time
Finally
