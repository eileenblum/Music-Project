It was a serene day
When I saw my meaning in this world
There wasn't even a breath of wind
To touch my sore skin
With suffering comes the emotions
And sight...

The past gave nothing to heal
Seeking something more to feel
Only the cold walls prove
That I exist

The present gives nothing to hold on
Reaching beyond suffering
Soon the dead leaves fall
And I sleep

It was a serene day
When I found my wrath in this world
There wasn't even a breath of wind
To give me strength to do His will
With suffering comes the emotions
And healing...
