Slowly cascading
Dead motions
The essence of every move

Mercurial worlds collapsing
Joining the fields of silence
The landscape of eternal sleep

How any life
Could ever see
The light here
In the deep

Once there was suffocation
Now inhaling to drown
Now it is the time
Just to rest here
And never to rise again
