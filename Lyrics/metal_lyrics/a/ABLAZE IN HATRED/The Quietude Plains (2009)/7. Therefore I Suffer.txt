In so many ways
I tried to see
The source of kindness
Hiding in me

In this serenity
Who shall come?
To hold me

When I am lonely
Unable to see
The things which are
In front of me...

One-dimensional agony
The only way to see here
Here in this blind world
Where people are walking by

In this serenity
Who shall come?
To hold me
