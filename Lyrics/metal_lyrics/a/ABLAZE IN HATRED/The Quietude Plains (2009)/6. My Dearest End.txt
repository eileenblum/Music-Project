Closer than ever
I reach my hands
To embrace the merciful one
The one who cave me this life

The perfect way
To gather my thoughts
To heal my senses
With those who have disappeared

Lying down
Feeling the heroic oneness
With the souls
Who once lied here

Closer than ever
I reach my heart
To feel the merciful one
The one who ended
This weak life
