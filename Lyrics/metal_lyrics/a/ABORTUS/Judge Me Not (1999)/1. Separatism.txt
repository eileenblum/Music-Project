Society is burning, yearning at my blood
Digging deep wounds, it's time to move on.
It's me against them until they exist no more

Separatism, separatism

No-one thought will turn this around
They're pushing their law
My steps now losing ground
Discipline by fear, they're pushing on
Zero respect now gets me by
[Repeat]

Separatism, separatism

[x3]
These insane thoughts enter my soul
Now I'm God-less, I'm left possessed

Godless, I'm left possessed

Separatism, separatism

I'll burn this truth straight
through your eyes
Now look from the grave straight up,
you'll see the sky. Nothing left here to say
This is my time to show them all

Their programming comes to an end
My unforgivable time of sorrow
Focused, now losing control
Fuck all their rules, fuck all their systems

Laughing as they bleed
Innocence lies as my victim
Spreading harsh truth
Losing my mind.
This is my time to fly
