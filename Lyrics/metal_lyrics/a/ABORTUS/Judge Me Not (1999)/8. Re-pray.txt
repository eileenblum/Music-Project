Kind yet fucking stupid and ignorant words from a prominent and corrupt Reverend, here in Australia.
God love him, 'cause no one else does.

The fairytale adult
The movie of all time
The mini-series to top all soaps
The show watched by the blind
On bent knee with pockets full
A smile, oh so kind
Lying, cheating, molesting,
I'm sent by the divine

Re-Pray

I'm the star of the circus
That rolls into your town
and I'm fronting the parade
I'm the one that's called the clown
A face so very trusting
With a wandering hand
Persuading and relaying verses
From the promised land

Re-Pray
Re-Pray
