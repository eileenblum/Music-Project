Through this open window feeds my life's end
No chance now, given up, these wounds, they won't mend
Reality here too much to deal with
Lost all that was worth feeling
So I took God into my hands and I'm forwarding my end

So I took the easy way out
Can't see what all the fuss is about

No-one else now in this world even matters
Every dream I had, has been shattered
There's hands held out to assist
But the fingers lay broken and limp
My dependency becomes my only friend
in forwarding my end
and I took the easy way out
Can't see what all the fuss is about

Can't take it, never could
So I took the easy way out
It's so easy to leave behind

Life's dealt me a battering this time
It's so easy to leave behind
Selfishness, betrayal, so kind
This dream has lost me in time
