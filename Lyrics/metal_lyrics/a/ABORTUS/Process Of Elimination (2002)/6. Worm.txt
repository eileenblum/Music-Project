Live your life in fear rely on your dependence
Push the blame believe you're shit always pretending
We're all at fault except the image in the mirror
Truth it hurts when spoken easier to cower

[Chorus]
Eat the worm
Eat the worm
Eat the worm
Choke on dirt worm

Circle of despair now healing your dependence
Shoulders yearn for tears now needing some attention

[Repeat Chorus]

Live your life in fear
Rely on your dependence
Push the blame on anyone
You're just pretending
Everyone's at fault
Except the mirror image
Truth it hurts when it's
So much easier to cower
Much easier to cower

You fucking worm
