Through dark dungeons I wander hearing
this beautiful voice calling me athward
Green mosses lead my pathways
eery shrieks fulfill my joy
calming fear enveils my body
suddenly standing before the gate
innaya... lost city
Of the twelve sleepers in Sadness
breaking open the doorway
I feel the tears in my heart
A grief hold for ages now set free
Broken houses death decay rotting
stenches of things unknown to us
Gods that were once here now left
left in the Mausoleum of Pain
strolling through streets, cracks
Gaping at me with soothing darkness
I feel the wind caressing my body
the first sense of resignation...
I will never leave this city of
Broken dreams, never
Spirits of unbearable calmness lie
fall... falling... down
Caress me... tear my black soul apart
With the grief and sorrow of Eras
The weeping of millions impaling my heart
falling... so sweet... falling down...
