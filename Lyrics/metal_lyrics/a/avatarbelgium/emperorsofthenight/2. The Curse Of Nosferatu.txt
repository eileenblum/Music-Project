The night is our day, the darkness is our light
As wolves... we cry... by the Fullmoon
As bats... we roam... through the shadows
As hunters... we sneak up... on our prey
bloodthirsty we set our teeth in the neck of a pure virgin
by the dawn we drink the elixir of immortality
Nosferatu... Lord of the Vampires, Eternal Hail!!!
Praise the undead in Your Name!
With passion in our veins we make our victims born again
In the dark horror of the night
To join us the Horde of the Vampires
The blood is the life, and again it shall be His!!!
