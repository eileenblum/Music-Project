He has raised the draw-bridge above the moat
He has locked and bolted all doors he passed
He has taken care of it all for he is the one

Who can lay himself to rest
Who can sleep for a thousand years
Who can close his coffin and eternally dream

For deep below the castle walls
He has taken care of it all it comes to him
on the etherial wings of a whispering wind
Oh, the care with which he has prepared
The tender traps, the soothing salvation
A glimpse of heaven, a sparkle of Hell
in a flower to unclose on the bare soll he left
Hypnotizing the mortals passion

Oh, see them bleed for him!
Oh, is he not great, this lord of illusions!
Oh, is he not mighty, when his winds grasp their dreams?

For deep below the castle walls
He has taken care of it all
He knows that again and again he shall rise
The Vampire's Sleep! The Vampire's Sleep!
