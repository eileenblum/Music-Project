Calling upon the Ancient Ones
Lords of a Time before memory
Calling upon Ninnghizhidda, serpent of the deep
The time of the entering of the Gods has begun!
The time of breaking through the gates has begun!

The Sign of the elder Gods has failed
Let the earth turn black, Oh mighty queen of Death Ereshkigal
With the glance of the death, they will Kill and Reward
Iak Sakkak, Ishmiggarah, Kutulu
No spell will keep them out

Ia Ia Ia Io Io Io
They are the Lords of Darkness, masters of Magicians
They are before creation, they are the Ancient Ones

Chaos, dreams of Tiamat will become reality
Dog-faced demons will live between the fog of eternity
The time of the entering of the Gods has begun!
The time of breaking through the gates has begun!

Ia Ia Ia Io Io Io
The are the Lords of Darkness masters of Magician
They are before Creation, they are the Ancient Ones
