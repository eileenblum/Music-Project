[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

They treat us like puppets and we suffer
Itâs time to react

Lose your self control and get rebel
Use your own head

Donât let them move you and be strong
Shot in their ass

âCause these are the politics, the worst of all men

Fight, fight for your right
Fight for tomorrowâs life

[Solo]

Fight, fight for your right
Fight for tomorrowâs life

Donât you believe to these men
Itâs time to react

âCause youâve got the power in your hands
Itâs time to react

Why must we obey to these men
Itâs time to react

Iâm sick of it all, itâs time to change it, we can start tonight
To fight
Fight for your right
Letâs fight!
Fight for your right

Donât be afraid of the masters
Itâs time to react
Time for rebellion, disaster!
Itâs time to react
I know itâs so hard to make something
Itâs time to react
Now with a song we are starting
Itâs time to react!

[Solo]

Donât you believe to these men
And fight for your right!
