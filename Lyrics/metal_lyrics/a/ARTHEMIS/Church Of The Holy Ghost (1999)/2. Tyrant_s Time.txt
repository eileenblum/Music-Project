[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Look to
Look to the past now and tell me what you see

Time passes
But nothingâs changing, still there is poor and rich

And still
There are dictators behind democracy

Only
The name has changed, the tyrants live in our days

Time of tyrants today, just like yesterday
Only the name has changed now
Behind their face they exploit our faith
Only to make what they couldnât make
The tyrants today are commanding our souls
From long time ago and so we cry
You canât stop their thirst of power, glory and gold

But when the moon becomes dark sadness comes down
And in few words you canât say âI donât mindâ
We are condemned to live like slaves without a dream
You canât escape, but life goes on

[Solo]

Time of tyrants today, just like yesterday
Only the name has changed now
Behind their face they exploit our faith
Only to make what they couldnât make
