[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

In darkness and rain Iâm trying to escape, but in vain
The Phantom of Death, I saw him last night in my dreams
Frustration and pain, I know these are now close to me
Please, God help my soul and give me the strength to release me

The Twilight in the Dark will make me free
But I have to find it among the trees
My nightmare will turn to a new good dream
The deepness of the forest seems like Hell
But now I have to escape from the Phantom of Death

Iâve tried to scream but nothing can save me from death
There is no way out, my fate has been marked once again
But I can be routed my hope of salvation is tough
The Twilight is near the lucency is now shining on

The Twilight in the Dark will make me free
But I have to find it among the trees
My nightmare will turn to a new good dream
The deepness of the forest seems like Hell
But now I have to escape from the Phantom of Death

[Solo]

And now the fireâs in my eyes
It means Iâll never have to die
My own revenge is here to stay
So pay your price and fly away

Now everythingâ s changed, the forces of night now are gone
No more fear and pain, the power of light made me strong
But when the night comes down and suddenly starts to rain
Oh Lord of the Night, I fear we will meet again

The Twilight in the Dark will make me free
But I have to find it among the trees
My nightmare will turn to a new good dream
The deepness of the forest seems like Hell
But now I have to escape from the Phantom of Death
