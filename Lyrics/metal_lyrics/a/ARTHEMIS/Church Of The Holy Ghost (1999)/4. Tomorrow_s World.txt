[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

I see the world around me
War, drugs and hate then what will be?
I fear the future will be very black

And if the world is like this shit
Is really better not to exist
Something must change or weâll be fucked

Can you hear me God?
Weâre losing our way
Make tomorrow better than yesterday
I believe in Tomorrowâs World
Where war and hate will be really old

And war is going everywhere
And everybody say âI donât careâ
But still I hope a better time

Together we can change this world
That seems so awful and so cold
Tomorrowâs World will rise with us

Can you hear me God?
Weâre losing our way
Make tomorrow better than yesterday
I believe in Tomorrowâs World
Where war and hate will be really old

Can we live without pain
In a world full of peace?
In a place where there is no hate
And the sun is shining high

[Solo]

The sun will shine high...
