[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Thereâs a mount between the silent trees
From the fortress you can watch it shine
On the top still lives a goddess
It is called the Lady of the Storm

Her face his a mystery
But her spite is not a novelty
Frozen blood runs in her veins
Now the terror sowerâ s coming back again

The termless wind of fire
Is blowing hard tonight
Oh no! It canât be the scourge...

And when the Storm comes down
For you thereâs no way out
White lightnings break the sky
Their flash have burned my eyes
âCause when the Storm comes down
For you thereâs no way out
White lightnings break the sky
Their flash have burnt my eyes

[Solo]

Goddess of thunder please stop your war against the human kind
I donât wanna die tonight
I know your violence is wasteful and we cannot fight it
I donât wanna die tonight
Canât you see? People are screaming and ready to die
I donât wanna die tonight
So please, listen to my petition and donât take our lives
I donât wanna die tonight

Her voiceful scream of fight
Has gone away tonight
But peace wonât last for so long

And when the Storm comes down
For you thereâs no way out
White lightnings break the sky
Their flash have burned my eyes
âCause when the Storm comes down
For you thereâs no way out
White lightnings break the sky
Their flash have burnt my eyes

Burning lights in the night
Blazing skies are burning my eyes
The preacher man has been saved by his prayer
And his hope now is reborn
The glittering sun is shining on
And will scrub our frights
The time has come to believe in what heâ s done
And to fight the sky
Stop the storm wind rise
