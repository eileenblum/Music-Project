[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Canât you see?
Youâre lying in the claws of the devil
Break the chains
Or you will be witched by him

Kill the demons, try to win your challenge
If youâll fight with fear
Catch the sword and fight for the rebellion
Your end is near
Fire in their eyes is like a hurricane
Escape from Hell
Escape from the flames of Hell

Oh... Demon of war
No... Donât take my soul
God, donât leave me alone
Devil, I say âDeath to you!â

[Solo]

Anger and revenge
Are gleaming now in my brain
Now you will die like the Sun in the night falls again
You canât destroy me
Iâm mortal, Iâm not a fool
My spirit, my Lord have said âNo mercy for you!â

Now youâre free
Your courage has defeated your fear
So fly with me
The voyage to Heaven is near

Kill the demons, try to win your challenge
If youâll fight with fear
Catch the sword and fight for the rebellion
Your end is near
Fire in their eyes is like a hurricane
Escape from Hell
Escape from the flames of Hell

Oooh... Demon of war
Nooo... Donât take my soul
God, donât leave me alone
Devil, I say âDeath to you!â
