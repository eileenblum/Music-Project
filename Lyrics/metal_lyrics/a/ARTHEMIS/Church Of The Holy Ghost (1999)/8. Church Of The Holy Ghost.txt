[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

The night has come
And the spirits are awake
The endless fog
Now has faded
Thereâ s something strange
In the sky and in the air
The sunshine has gone
But a mystic light is shining on

The abandoned Church
Is still kept by the Ghost
His evil eye
Will make you dust
A terrible curse
Is now coming down on you
Donât open the gate
Or youâll fall into disdain

The awful organ sound
Re-echoes in the ground
The spirits are insane
You will be beheaded

Your head will touch the floor
Youâll paint the walls with blood
Donât think it is unreal
Now your end is near

The Guardian of the night
Can whip away your life
The hold of the lost souls
Is his dread abode
Donât try to violate it
Or death will be your fate
Believe in my last words
Escape and save your soul

[Solo]

The Ghost will take your soul...
The Guardian of the night
Can whip away your life
The hold of the lost souls
Is his dread abode
Donât try to violate it
Or death will be your fate
Believe in my last words
Escape and save your soul...
