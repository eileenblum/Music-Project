[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

[I Act: Darkness]

Itâs in the story itâs in todayâs life
It can make you die
Only for glory and the people die
Whatâs the reason? Why?

It can make you die
Whatâs the reason? Why?

Why canât we make this war
Stop with no other blood
No, no more agony
No more deadly family
ooh... ooh...

[Solo]

Put all your rage against the war
United the energy is more, more, more, more
Warâs just another name for Hell
We havenât learnt what story tells, tells, tells, tells
War, war, war, war
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos

[II Act : The prophecy]

Desperation and agony war will bring to us
The silence of the human kind will never change this world

And guns, bombs and cannonballs are still destroying our life
The prophecy of Mother Earth reveals we have to die

[III Act: Sounds of victory]

But if weâre strong our justice will be done
The power of people will rise
Weâll ride the light, the sun will be our guide
The crowd now is ready to fight
ooh.....ooh..
Itâs not a game, we mustnât feel the pain
Our last chance to win is now
The peace will reign, together weâll put out the flames
The Salvation Army goes on
ooh... ooh...
