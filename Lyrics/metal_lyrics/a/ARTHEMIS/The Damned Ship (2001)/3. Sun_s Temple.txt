[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Since too many years the wicked tyrant's trying to waste our life
He's sowing the terror on and on
We're living like preys, we cannot escape and find a place to hide
The risk of a slaughter is too high!

A shadow of pain falls like a veil our eyes to penetrate
This fraud's a creation of the king
He promise a wonderland, enjoying in drink our blood every day
Now is time to kill him face to face!

The glory of my father set me free
The golden knight now lives inside of me
My promise of defending my own land
Becomes reality

To the temple of the sun, now I am marching on
Nobody can change my own will
I'll ask for living in a wonderland
This sadness has to end
My mission will be glorious

Oooohhhh... Oooohhhh... Oooohhhh...

The glory of my father sets me free
The golden knight is flashing on to me
Erasing all the evil I've maintained
My promise of defending my own friends!
