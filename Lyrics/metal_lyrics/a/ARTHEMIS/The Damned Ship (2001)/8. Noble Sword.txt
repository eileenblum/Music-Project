[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Searching for diamonds and pearls
Ready to conquer all the world
I am the keeper of your fate

Made by the goddess of the moon
My blade burns to strike the fools
So let the battlefield be mine

This is the time, here is my shout
I am not frightened by the crowd
We'll do the revolution

I have seen through the gates thousands men full of hate ,they are coming!
Hypnotize, terrorize everyone you will find on your way
Only you can resist ,you're my cover, my shield, feel the fire!
As the magical spell will be spread I will conquer the crown.

Noble sword ,prepare yourself for the war
Fight!don't give up!
Between fire and blood lies your soul
Noble sword,
Fight 'til the end of our time,noble sword... ATTACK!

Uniting my forces before the final battle,calling to me
the power of the wind
Awake in me the spirit of the steel, and soon I will find the way

I'm wondering why they cannot see the future, running to death
They're goin' to pay their price
Enclose the fools, create a ring of fire, nobody'll go out from here

Noble sword ,prepare yourself for the war
Fight!don't give up!
Between fire and blood lies your soul
Noble sword,
Tell me who will be the next!
