[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

The daylight has faded, the wind's blowing strong
The black night is spreading her voice
I can feel his soul, not far from the mounts,
He's ready for destruction!

The wizard foresaw he would spare anyone
Get ready for Starchild's return
Accused, whipped, than burnt, as the wicked Satan son,
The ashes are turning to stardust!

Fireballs , thunders're coming, straight from the sky
Crushing, growing, exploding, breaking the ground
Blazing fire is burning, in every place
Now is time to land your, lethal attack!

No, no more future, the avenger is coming soon
Don't try to hide you are going to meet your doom
Fast like a thunder he will strike and you will die
Take your last breath then you won't see the light!

He flies over the world, through stars he knows the destiny of us all
He flies over the world, Starchild, we want to be your force!
