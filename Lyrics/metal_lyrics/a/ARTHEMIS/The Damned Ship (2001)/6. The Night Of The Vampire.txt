[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Another time
The candlelight
Burns out when the clock strikes the midnight

It seems to sense
From everywhere
His fury's rushing much too fast

He rules the underworld until the night will come
And sets him to attack and suck your blood
And when the night comes you'll find no place to hide
I'll try but I've lost my sight!

In the night of the vampire the evil spirits grow
And search for the victim of their lord
You can feel the killer's arising from the deads
His spirit will live for the eternity!

I'm loosing control!!!

In the night of the vampire the evil spirits grow
And search for the victim of their lord
In the reign of the mighty what a mystic atmosphere
The end is getting near!

See the fear in your blind eyes, the mirror of your fate
Be proud and wait, it is too late, the course is coming down

Take my blood, I know my destiny
But listen to the words I have to say to you
I feel the loneliness, the darkness frightens me
Now I am ready to die!
