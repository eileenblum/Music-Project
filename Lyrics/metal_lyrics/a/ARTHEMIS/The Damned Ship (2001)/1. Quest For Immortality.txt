[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

There was a man long time ago
He tried with his army to conquer the world
Defending the secret of the eternal life given him by God
He flew to the sky and the secret'd been lost

Messiahs of death don't want me to ride
Blaming my wishes, confusing my mind but I'm
Protecting my fate from the chains of the lord of the evil reign
I don't wanna be a slave of pain

The flight of the warrior'll stop the demons' raid
Black knights, evil messengers have to burn in hell
We wait for deliverance, let the proud man ride
The law of the sword,you know, don't forgives who cries
Fly with the forces of light
We'll be together tonight, believe in me, I will lead you

Riding fast on the burnin' wings of Pegasus
Magic powers I will find
Tonight, tonight he's going to be immortal safe will be my soul
The light will break the sadness of this tragedy
But now is time to strike
Don't fear this evil night...

Oooohhh... Oooohhh... Oooohhh...
But evil presences are wasting the sunset in the sky
Obscuring the way that will change my life
The lord of the dark has nothing to say
His black magic powers are fading away
I'll come to my people, I'll use my own gift the world to save
And'll be your own shelter, catch my hand...
and the story has come to the end...
