When all the world's falling and you've got no place to go
Brother don't stop dreaming don't you think that everything is gone
Close your eyes, nothing will go wrong
Hold your head up high once again

...the Burning Star

You're searching for a reason, for a way to carry on
But life's a changing season and it won't last for so long
Let your pride and glory set you free, raise your hand don't stop believing

Like a Burning Star, can you feel us? Can you feel us?
Sons of a Burning Star, can you feel us? Can you feel us?
Like a Burning Star, and forever fighting all for one
Like a Burning Star, can you feel us?

Can you feel us? Can you feel us?

Like a Burning Star, can you feel us? Can you feel us?
Sons of a Burning Star, can you feel us? Can you feel us?
Like a Burning Star, and forever fighting all for one
Like a Burning Star, can you feel us?
Like a Burning Star, can you feel us? Can you feel us?
Sons of a Burning Star, can you feel us? Can you feel us?
Like a Burning Star, and forever fighting on and on
Like a Burning Star, can you feel us?
