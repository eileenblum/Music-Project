[A. Martongelli]

Take a look at the history
War, destruction, misery
But every time we stand up
Someone lives to be remembered

Feel the glory down your spine
Leave the pain and all behind
Flames are burning higher
Hear the thunder, hearts on fire

No where do we go?
We-are-blood

Take my hand and you will see
They are fighting for your rights
Keeper of your destiny
Hold your head up in this night

Open scars never cured
Make the world so insecure
Victims of the grand illusion
Living without fear

Screaming like a raging fire
Ready to explode

WE ARE BLOOD of generations
WE ARE BLOOD blood of generations
WE HOLD THE FLAME of salvation
WE ARE BLOOD of generations

Now where do we go?
We-are-blood
Condemned to survive
We-are-blood

WE ARE BLOOD of generations
WE ARE BLOOD blood of generations
WE HOLD THE FLAME of salvation
WE ARE BLOOD of generations
We-are-blood
