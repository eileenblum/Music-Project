Another night I feel I'm fallin' apart
I'm searching for an island in the Sun
The poison's coming down my spine
The breath of death, the danger line
Is comin' down and down to kill the light

You rise and you fall, deep in my soul
Just like there's no way to come back
You lie, you take us under control
We've been caught in your trap

I see dark fire down below
I feel the poison killing me
I feel like fallin' down in a hole
Into a world no one can see

And no we can't go on
Don't turn your back
Forever we'll be strong

Fly away from your broken dreams, from the man who killed the Sun
Run away, the war has just begun
Save your soul, your destiny from the man who killed the Sun
Run away, the war has just begun

And no we can't go on
Don't turn your back
Forever we'll be strong

Fly away from your broken dreams, from the man who killed the Sun
Run away, the war has just begun
Save your soul, your destiny from the man who killed the Sun
Run away, the war has just begun
