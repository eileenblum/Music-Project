Demons are coming my way
Blazing death riders the execution you'll never betray
Jokers are diggin' my grave
Nightmares, invaders draggin' you down to hell and back

We are proud to cross the gate
Hell is on fire, no one is safe
Angels and Demons surround me
Reapers, dead warriors, liars and fools forever will burn

Praying for my damnation
Hellbound is waiting putting you down, down in a hole
Flames will rise, there's no way, no return
You'll be dead before the dawn there's no way to run

Burn! I'll take you down
Down! down to the ground
No! no return from the Reign Of Terror
Burn! I'll take you down
Down! down to the ground
You! you're a slave of the Reign Of Terror

Flames will rise, there's no way, no return
You'll be dead before the dawn there's no way to run

Burn! I'll take you down
Down! down to the ground
No! no return from the Reign Of Terror
Burn! I'll take you down
Down! down to the ground
You! you're a slave of the Reign Of Terror
