Every Day I'm Pickin' Up The Pieces
Feeling dead inside and my heart is gettin' cold
Trying to hide in the dark but emptiness surrounds me
How I wish to be with you tonight
Why can't we get it right?

From a life hand in hand, side by side
To a world where the dreams are only lies
I'm alone as you

Wanna cry but no one seems to listen
Still I ask myself if there's a heaven in the sky

If only I could fly away
From this cold empty room
I'm falling to pieces, let the light shining through

From a life hand in hand, side by side
To a world where the dreams are only lies
I'm alone as you

Let your heart slowly die deep inside
In a world where love and hate collide
I'm alone as you... as you

Alone

From a life hand in hand, side by side
To a world where the dreams are only lies
I'm alone as you

Let your heart slowly die deep inside
In a world where love and hate collide
I'm alone as you... as you

Alone
