[A. Martongelli]

Real world, everybody need salvation
No matter if we're right or we are wrong
Criminals, sea of lies, superstition
The plan for mass-destruction's set and done

Real world, running fast to our fortress
The game is over, innocence is burnt
Kill the light, on the streets the boys are reckless
The blood red sky is falling down

I can't release myself from pain, from the agony within
On the way to self-destruction, running fast, misery
You're down to your knees, pills helping you to spread disease
And no one can hear you scream
No one can hear your fuckin' scream

What we are fighting for? is this the real world?
Tell them to stop, we're walking through fire again
'till we get back to our empire

Real world, it's a neverending nightmare
'till the end will come and justice will be done
Don't give up to the war of the nations
We'll rise, all for one and one for all

I can't release myself from pain, from the agony within
On the way to self-destruction, running fast, misery
You're down to your knees, pills helping you to spread disease
No one can hear you scream
No one can hear your fuckin' scream
Let us hear your scream!!

What we are fighting for? is this the real world?
Tell them to stop, we're walking through fire again
We only get one life
What we are fighting for? is this the real world?
Tell them to stop, the Sun will be shining again
We will get back to our empire
We're climbing up the mountain of sorrow, bring me back to life, to how reality should be
Bring us back to the REAL WORLD!!
