Still awake

I cannot see, I cannot feel
what's wrong on in my head?
I feel cold
I'm on my way to insanity
Behind the door there is light and mystery
the paranoia gives me pain,
death is sitting next to me.

It was you, it was me
but I can't see the end.
Can't take a breath I suffocate
no way no release
There is no cure to take away
the sense of mystery

The scream of pain drag me down down down
but how I miss the peace I've lost
and never found
never found

I wake up in shadow
it won't last forever
I won't die,
I'm still awake.
Anger is screaming
I won't stop believing
here I am,
I'm still awake

I see all blur no way to run,
I'm down on my knees
I gotta fight I will survive
I can't let this be
don't run away I'm on my way,
I'm coming over you
this evil place is too bad to be true
to be true.
Take me higher, I will survive

I wake up in shadow
it won't last forever
I won't die,
I'm still awake.
Anger is screaming
I won't stop believing
here I am,
I'm still awake

I wake up in shadow
it won't last forever
I won't die,
I'm still awake.
Anger is screaming
I won't stop believing
here I am,
I'm still awake
