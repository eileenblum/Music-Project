We will fight, we won't fall!

The end will never come
The pain won't last forever
The war has just begun
We stand and fight together

The roaring lightning strikes
The freedom flag will burn
This faith and sacrifice
We're gonna pay with blood

It's time to say NO MORE
No matter 'cause we fight

The world is overloaded
It's time for REVOLUTION
So let the truth be told
It's time for retribution

We know we're not alone
There's no more need to cry
STAND UP
We're not afraid to die

It's time to say NO MORE
No matter 'cause we fight
We'll never walk alone
Ready to strike

From the Moon to the Sun 
Can you hear the roar 
We will fight we won't fall
From the east to the west 
Can you hear the call 
We will fight we won't fall
Open your eyes and tell 'em down 
We will fight we won't fall
You gotta have no fear, justice for all 
We will fight we won't fall
