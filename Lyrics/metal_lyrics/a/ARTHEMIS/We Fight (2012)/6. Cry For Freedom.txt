Do I have the right to say my name?
Do I have the will to stop and watch my world goin' insane?
Do I have the strength to change my fate? ...my fate
We'll cross the gates of hell, don't believe there's no escape

We are not to blame
We don't feel ashamed
It's time to rise the flag of freedom
Find your way, it's good or evil

Is it this place we call home?
We'll ride against the law, we all live under control
Do I have to climb the walls of death?
See the anger in their eyes, see the mankind bleeding wrath

Freedom for the fighters
And glory's what we're living for
Freedom for the fighters
For all the men who cry for freedom

It's time to rise the flag of freedom
Find your way, it's good or evil

Freedom for the fighters
And glory's what we're living for
Freedom for the fighters
For all the men who cry for freedom
For the fighters
See the light above, we'll touch the sky
