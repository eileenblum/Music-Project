We push the pedal to the Metal
We'll always stand together
Through fire blood and steel, we are soldiers of true Metal
We're warriors of steel, we ride, hell on wheels
We're faster than a bullet let me hear you scream

Glory, dignity and pride, the call of the wild
We pray the God of Thunder, we are creatures of the night

Can you feel the power
Flames will take us higher

We all live for Metal, Heavy Metal!
On the wings of steel we want it all, power!

The power of the Sword, the glory of the Hammer
The Hammer of the Gods turns into the Metal Hammer
We burn it to the ground, we push it to the core
Defenders of the faith on the run again
Pull the trigger

We all live for Metal, Heavy Metal!
On the wings of steel we want it all
Like a burning fire
Raise your hands, we'll live forevermore

We all live for Metal
On the wings of steel we want it all
Like a burning fire
Raise your hands, we'll live forevermore

We all live for Metal
On the wings of steel we want it all
Like a burning fire
Raise your hands, we'll live forevermore

Can you feel the power
Flames will take us higher

Can you feel the power
Flames will take us higher
