[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

When youâve got a dream you spread the power within...

I am coming up to your land
Passing forests and hot desert sands
And I want to be the pioneer of new worlds
Iâve walked through winter storms
Iâve ride towards the Sun
Living my life day by day

Iâve known all kind of man
Of all religions and different race
And I learn something new every day
Until you live and let live
Freedom is for all to see
But the wickedness of the men has created war and disasters

On your way youâll find who tells you lies, donât believe him
Looking at the stars youâll find your way

When youâve got a dream you spread the power within
Trying to make it real
The traveller will ride and help you to catch your star
To fly and let your spirit free...

[Solo]

When youâve got a dream you spread the power within
Trying to make it real
The traveller will ride and help you to catch your star
To fly and let your spirit free...
When youâve got a dream you spread the power within
Trying to make it real
The traveller will ride and help you to catch your star
To fly and let your spirit free...
