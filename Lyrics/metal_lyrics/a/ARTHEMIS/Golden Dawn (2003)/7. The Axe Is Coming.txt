[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

When you get inspired a thunder strikes your soul
And no one can feel the wonder of your thoughts
Lightnings and bombs adrenalize your world
Then nothingâll turn off the flame inside of you

You are strong and you want to get higher
You want to get higher
Breaking out the walls and the clouds
You will set everyone for the attack!

The feelings you get when music turns to flame
Like ten thousands knives is stinging you again
The charm hands of God are giving you the power
And you understand youâve only to devour

Why all the senses bring me up to the sky?
I donât know, Iâll follow you
Forever and ever Iâll play it âtil the day I will die

The Axe is coming down to bring you to the sky
To give sensations to our mind

[Solo]

Why all the senses bring me up to the sky?
I donât know, Iâll follow you
Forever and ever Iâll play it âtil the day I will die

The Axe is coming down to bring you to the sky
To give sensations to our mind
The Axe will strike and give you strength to carry on
Beware! You canât stop the rage of the Axe...

The Axe is coming... The Axe is coming...
The Axe is coming and will take you away!
