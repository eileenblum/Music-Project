[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Confused by the absence of the light we only feel the terrorâs rise
Condemned to run without a shelter

Your torture kills the men and makes them blind, but donât you feel so satisfied
My hate is gonna rule forever

The flames are burning higher
Iâm the Keeper of the Fire
And Iâll never sell my soul to you

Your force is an illusion
In my heart I find the reason
To destroy what you believe youâve done

There is no escape for you
The Flame will reveal the truth and pulverize your face

Fire, set us free, give us a chance to live
Through the centuries youâve left our spirits higher
Donât disguise your power,spread it out... We are set!!!

Aaaah... Aaaah... Aaaah...

[Solo]

Fire, set us free, give us a chance to live
Through the centuries youâve left our spirits higher
Donât disguise your wasting power

Fire, set us free, give us a chance to live
Through the centuries youâve left our spirits higher
Eyes of Fire and burning heart, Iâll crash and burn
In honour of my soul... I will kill them all!!!

[Solo]
