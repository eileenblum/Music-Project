[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

If I watch the past days of my life I can feel winds of war
Everywhere I turn my head I see revenge
Looking at the thin line that was signed between my thoughts
I realize that it disappears, everythingâs out of control

I feel hate!!!

The rain has come without a warning but I still donât understand
Whatâs the reason why itâs gonna dirt my hand
Now I hear the screams of the man who should be me
And I want to rise again!!!

Itâs the time,
Time for me to break the curse
And to stop the Black Rain fall on to my soul
I wanna change the colours of my life
This night I will expect to see the sun

[Solo]

Now your arms are stronger,
And only now you can start a new life,
Through the power of your mind defeat the Evil Sorcerer
But every day youâll pray the Lord your soul to shelter
He will come back... ha ha ha...

And I want to rise again...

Itâs the time,
Time for me to break the curse
And to stop the Black Rain fall on to my soul
I wanna change the colours of my life
This night I will expect to see the sun

[Solo]
