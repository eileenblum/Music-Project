[Heavy Load cover]

I look the way I want and choose
I talk the way I want, they lose
Can't force me to follow their way
My soul and arms and brain are strong
Among the creeps I don't belong
I am no society slave

[Chorus:]
Might for right
I'm a free man, I'm ready to fight
Might for right
I'm a free man, I'm ready to fight

I see them all follow the way
All the way down to their grave
They're losing, their souls can't be healed
They tried to sit on top of me
But I fought, I made them see
I'm stronger, I'm harder, I'm steel

[Chorus]

Standing on my own two legs
I turn my back on your deadheads
I won't take no part in your game
Natures law is might for right
But I'm strong can see the light
I'm breaking the frame,
Got to head bang to stay sane

[Chorus]
