[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

Returning to the Land of Fire Iâll show you the power of the Gods
You laugh and live your life although you already know that Iâm gonna hunt you

Oooooh... Oooooh...

Become my slave or die forever, burn in Hell and pay your faults
Your evil minds create new followers, youâll better fear my blade

Arthemis strikes to save us all
Donât give up, never surrender
With arch and silver arrows
She makes the Fire in the sky... Shot!

[Solo]

donât like the fools, I feel no mercy for the tyrants of the World
To let the justice rule I say that Iâll kill you and destroy your sons

Arthemis strikes to save us all
Donât give up, never surrender
With arch and silver arrows
She makes the Fire in the sky
