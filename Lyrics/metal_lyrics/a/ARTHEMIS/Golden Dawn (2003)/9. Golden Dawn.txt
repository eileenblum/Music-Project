[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

From this hill down to the lake
Iâve found a moment to be free
And now Iâm gonna dream

I was too much blind to see
The answer to my fears inside of me
That no... No one could feel

Please God answer to my prayer
Donât let this charming Sun fall again
Make all my dreams come true
Donât waste my own land with the night
Let this day last forever
Since now I will always be free

Uuuhh... Uuuhh... Now my heart is cold
I want to be alone and be touched by the warmth of the Sun

You will start to cry
If you donât see the light
But if you see this Golden Dawn shining on your face
All tears will fade away

[Solo]

You will start to cry
If you donât see the light
But if you see this Golden Dawn shining on your face
All tears will fade
You will start to cry
If you donât see the light
But if you look to the Dawn you will see
That all tears will fade away

All tears will fade away...
