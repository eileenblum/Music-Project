[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

It started years ago
When my spirit got into
A dreadful world of lies and sorceries
Turning my blind faith straight to Hell

A mystical substance
Gave the power to my hands
To kill, steal and deny my evil faults
Please break this nightmare, stop this growing curse

Iâm running through a raw way
Waiting for the Sun to shine
And hiding in the darkness
To cover my disguise and call the...

Master of the Souls
You will be the one
Thatâll let me start a new life and erase my winds of war
Show me all the ways
To release me from pain
I donât want to burn my soul, Iâll pay the price for all.

[Solo]

No way to erase my past
I feel his sight on to my neck
By now nothing more has left to believe in
This is my cry, please let my spirit free

Iâm running through a raw way
Waiting for the Sun to shine
And hiding in the darkness
To cover my disguise and call the...

Master of the Souls
You will be the one
Thatâll let me start a new life and erase my thirst of blood
Show me all the ways
To release me from pain
Giving my soul to you Iâm sure to rise up from this scourge
Oooooh... Master of Souls... Oooooh... Oooooh
