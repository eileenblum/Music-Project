[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

I lived my life through stealing and killing
Donât ask me what I was searching for
Everyone remember my sight, Iâd got the Devil in my eyes

So face to face they tried to face me
And all my fury passed me by
Fighting to survive, but no way out for me to escape

Now you are died and all the things youâve done will fall on you
No more disguise, is time for you to feel the pain

I raise my arms and look up to the sky remembering what I did
Condemned to run all time from Hell to Hell
Do you remember when all has begun, there is no life for me
And now I have to roam from Hell to Hell

[Solo]

I wonât give up, Iâll try forever
But I canât find the peace of mind
Luxury and anger had become for me my eternal cross

Now you are died and all the things youâve done will fall on you
No more disguise, is time for you to feel the pain

I raise my arms and look up to the sky remembering what I did
Condemned to run all time from Hell to Hell
Do you remember when all has begun, there is no life for me
And now I have to roam from Hell to Hell
