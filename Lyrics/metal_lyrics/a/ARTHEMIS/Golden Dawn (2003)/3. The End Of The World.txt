[Lyric by Andrea Martongelli]

...Come on!!!

Roaming the Seas and the mountains
Iâm searching for you
Revealing what terrible curse will sign our doom

Castles and villages are falling
The ground gushes blood
Men run in every side, unable to fight this war

Down in the Abyss something burns, nooo... noooooo!!!

Canât you feel the Devilâs angerâs rising on to get what he wants
Canât you hear the Judgement Trumpets, oh no, itâs the end of the World

A shellfire of evil has come,so we will die!

[Solo]

Angels contrast the Demonâs force, nooo... noooooo!!!

Canât you feel the Devilâs angerâs rising on to get what he wants
Canât you hear the Judgement Trumpets, oh no, itâs the end of the World

God,can you hear me? Please help us to find
The power to shield all Mankind
Iâm on the run,ready to spread out my rage

God,can you hear me? Please help us to find
The power to shield all Mankind
Unite all for one we will save the World!!!
