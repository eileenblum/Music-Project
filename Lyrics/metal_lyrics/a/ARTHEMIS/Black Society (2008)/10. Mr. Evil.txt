You tell me I gotta run for you
You tell me I gotta live for you
What the hell do you mean
I'm angry again
Get ready for pain
Don't be clever
You will never know
They call you Mr.Evil
Hey you do you think I'm nut
No friends this is all you've got
Your world is fake
Your tongue like a snake
Tell me what's your plan
Don't pretend to be my friend
Don't be clever
You will never know
They call you Mr.Evil
Don't be clever
You will never know
They call you Mr.Evil
Don't be clever
You will never know
They call you Mr.Evil
Mr.Evil
Mr.Evil
