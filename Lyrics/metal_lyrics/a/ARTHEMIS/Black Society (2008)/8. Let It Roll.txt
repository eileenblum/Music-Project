The crowd gather all around us
And it seems out of control
You'll find a concrete jungle
Ready for rock'n'roll!
Oh yeah! The eyes are burning
Oh yeah! And the war machine is turnin'
The people are around you
Are screamin' out your name
No compromise
'case we always play on ten
Oh yeah! Our guns are loaded
Oh yeah! And the fireworld explode
And I want to rise again
Never lose the faith
I want to rise again
Get up! Get ready to roll
Let it roll!
Let it roll!
The fire still burns in your soul
Let! Let! Let!
Let it roll!
Together we'll rock them to the bones
The loud guitar is screaming into your soul
And I want to rise again
Never lose the faith
I want to rise again
Get up! Get ready to roll
Always ready to roll
