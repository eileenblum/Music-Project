I'm running over the seventh hangar
Lookin' out for you
This place is driving me mad
I hope your promises we're true
Oh no! Confusion's in my mind
You're in a serious danger
And you'll better never lie
You run away from the alien action
Breakin' all the rules
You fly away to forget the past
Cause you know it won't last forever
Oh no! The evil's in your eyes
You'll better run for a shelter
On your trip straight to hell
Tell me what went wrong
Fear my own electri-fire
Never lie again
Feel the pain
Electri-fire
I'm running out of control
And I won't be back no more
Where the fire explodes
Evil comes back for more
And I know you're one of a kind
With the power of the electri-fire
I will make you blind
Tell me what went wrong
Fear my own electri-fire
Never lie again
Feel the pain
Electri-fire
