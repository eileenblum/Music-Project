Welcome to the darkest train in the world
We know for sure you won't get bored
Buy your ticket for a no return
Just relax, face on the floor!
No, don't give me the blame
Fright out you'll never win the game
Fright train, comin' on a fright train
You'll never gonna be back home
Wild games livin' on the night train
Lie down on out bed of nails
Fright train, comin' on a fright train
Scream but it's too late
We'll ever stop again
It's just your fanatic psycho-pain
You can call the cops
You can fall in tears
But all this shit looks so real
Carry on bad wishes straight to hell
And smoke your latest cigarette
No, don't give me the blame
Fright out you'll never win the game
Fright train, comin' on a fright train
You'll never gonna be back home
Wild games livin' on the night train
Lie down on out bed of nails
Fright train, comin' on a fright train
Scream but it's too late
We'll ever stop again
We're getting to the station through your blood
