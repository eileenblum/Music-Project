So now you tell me
That you'll never be the same
It seems to be there no more games to play
The sun refuses to shine
And it's driving me insane
And all I had to say
Doesn't matter anyway
I'm falling into a sea that never ends
But no one seems to care
No chance to live, no turning back again
The night will tell
They know your feelings they're the angels in black
And all our wishes have been caught in a trap
If there's a way to return I'll save a prayer for myself
I've seen a million faces praying for their sins
But heaven in the real world is just a dream
How can I live? Where have you been
When I was there?
And all you had to say
Has taken me far away
They know your feelings they're the angels in black
And all our wishes have been caught in a trap
If there's a way to return I'll save a prayer for myself
I'm falling into a sea that never ends
But no one seems to care
No chance to live, no turning back again
The night will tell
They know your feelings they're the angels in black
And all our wishes have been caught in a trap
They know your feelings they're the angels in black
And all our wishes have been caught in a trap
If there's a way to return I swear I'll find my way
Angels in black
