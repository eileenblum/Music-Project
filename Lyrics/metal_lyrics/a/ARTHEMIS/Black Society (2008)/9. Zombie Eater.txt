Out in the cold
In a world of dead
There's something to dismember
One by one
Soon you will be dead
Fading through the never
The way you crawl in the darkness
Is such a shame
And I'm the one that makes the fear
Running through your veins
Get me some fire
You gotta be my slaves
You know there's no more shelter
Higher and higher
Can't you see the flames
Burning on forever
The way you crawl in the darkness
Is such a shame
And I'm the one that makes the fear
Running through your veins
Your souls will belong
To the world of the damned
Echoes in your mind
Through the darkness you will find
No more smiling faces
In a world that you create
Echoes in your mind
Through the darkness you will find
No more smiling faces
Falling down to the deepest hell
(Let us to the darkest pain)
You cannot run, cannot hide your pain
You're livin' an illusion
Hungry for blood, I will drive your head
Through the wheel of confusion
The way you crawl in the darkness
Is such a shame
And I'm the one that makes the fear
Running through your veins
Your souls will belong
To the world of the damned
Echoes in your mind
Through the darkness you will find
No more smiling faces
In a world that you create
Echoes in your mind
Through the darkness you will find
No more smiling faces
Falling down to the deepest hell
(Let us to the darkest pain)
