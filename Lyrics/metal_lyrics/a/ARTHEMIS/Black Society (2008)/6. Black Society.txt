Tonight i woke up from myself
Searching for something that I am
I watch the people all around me
Tonight I woke up from myself
Voices are whispering in my head
Something I'd better not tell
Can you hear them screaming
Can you hear the voices calling my name
No I can't believe it
They will never understand
I wake up in the morning
And all I get is something to forget
Can you hear them screaming
Can you hear the voices screaming my name
Let my heart stop beating
Nothing more will be the same
We're living in danger
We live in the black society
No place for a stranger
You're part of the black society, black society
I watch the war inside my head
Spinning around in my black bed
I talk but no one seems to care
How can it be? Am I going mad?
God give me a reason for this shame
You're the one who knows my restless pain
We're living in danger
We live in the black society
No place for a stranger
You're part of the black society, black society
