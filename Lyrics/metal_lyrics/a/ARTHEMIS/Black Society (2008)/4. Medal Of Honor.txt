Marching hours to another new field
Bombs meet bodies on this crazy wheel
Breaking bullets, loaded guns
You repent of your sins with a medal of honour
Shades of happiness are lost in me
Thinkin' of you and me, we felt complete yeah!
I won't blame my choice to be here again
The sky will fall, this war will last forever
My flesh and bones hurt
We're running through the never
Honour, honour, means nothing at all
(When) people lyin' into the unknown
Father, father, I will return
I won't close my eyes 'til I return no I won't!!
I'm twisting and turning
I'm smashing, killing, this is war!
The sky will fall, this war will last forever
My flesh and bones hurt
We're running through the never
Honour, honour, means nothing at all
(When) people lyin' into the unknown
Father, father, I will return
I won't close my eyes 'til I return no I won't!!
