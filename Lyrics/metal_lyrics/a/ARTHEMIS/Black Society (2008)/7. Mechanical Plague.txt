Scream words of justice
You can scream words of pain
In the cyber-world we're livin'
It doesn't matter anyway
Violent technologies
Are knockin' at your door
It's a fight against humanity
A fight against the world
Brainwash, cyber-sex
It's a mechanical plague
Brainwash, cyber-sex
It's gonna drive me insane
They sell you what they want
Comin' through the night
Tell them what you need
And feel alright
You're just another victim
Of the things we'll never learn
Running through the mountains
You can hide in the deep blue sea
Take a look all around you
Be a cyborg just like me
No more love and passions
They will give you eternal life
Don't you think you are invincible
And drink their sea of lies
