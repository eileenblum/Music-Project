There is a time when all men
Believe they can change the world
Telling us lies, controlling our souls

Star troops, silver knights
Lights and purple fire
We want justice for all

Nobody wants to challenge
The rage of the Silver Hawk
Too late to stop the grand firestorm

The Moon's chasing the Sun
The burst will make a huge hole in the sky
Of the Astral Empire

We stand for the astral justice
Over the Moon and the Sun
Through fire, x-ray eyes and lances
Always striking the night
The cruel neverending star war never dies

[Solo]

The Moon's chasing the Sun
The burst will make a huge hole in the sky
Of the Astral Empire

We stand for the astral justice
Over the Moon and the Sun
Through fire, x-ray eyes and lances
Always striking the night
The cruel neverending star war never dies
