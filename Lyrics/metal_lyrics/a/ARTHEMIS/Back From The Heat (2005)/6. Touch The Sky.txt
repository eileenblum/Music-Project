I am feeling alone and the sadness is breaking my heart
Through his whispers an angel makes me cry
All reminds me that I've got to be strong

Now I've gotta get away
Wanna try to find the strength to go on
Gotta run away from the loneliness
And look for more and more

I won't give you the chance to blame me
No one will understand

Out of the limit I wanna touch the sky
No more illusions, will never trust your lies
Will never hide

Through the river of my fears
I will sail to look for the truth
Never mind if I will die today
I've got nothing to lose

I won't give you the chance to blame me
No one will understand
Your revenge always burns my soul
My mind's out of control

Out of the limit I wanna touch the sky
No more illusions, will never trust your lies
Always breaking my oath

I take a look into the sky
Still asking for a star

[Solo]

I won't give you the chance to blame me
No one will understand
Your revenge always burns my soul
My mind's out of control

Out of the limit I wanna touch the sky
No more illusions, will never trust your lies
Always breaking my oath
I don't wanna cry no more
