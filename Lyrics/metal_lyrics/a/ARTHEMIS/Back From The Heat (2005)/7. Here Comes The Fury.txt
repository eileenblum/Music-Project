I am hunted by the Devil
Searching for a shelter
Screaming like never before
Gotta run before they'll get me
They will never catch me
I still feel the heat of the ground

My heart never surrender
Forever I'll remember
Won't trust the liar no more
I always have a vision
Never found a reason
Why I should dream evil thoughts

Warning tonight
So here comes the Fury
Screaming and burning the streets
Keep that alive
And never say never or you will die

All the earth will be on fire
This is my desire
I'm back from the heat right now
My fist will strike forever
We will burn together
So tell me what's wrong and what's right

Warning tonight
So here comes the Fury
Screaming and burning the streets
Keep that alive
And never say never or you will die

Here comes the Fury

[Solo]

Even though you're laughing at me
No one can forget me
'cause I fought the rude hand of doom
You know you're a believer
You make me shivers
Please tell me what's wrong and what's right...

What is wrong and what's right

Warning tonight
So here comes the Fury
Screaming and burning the streets
Keep that alive
And never say never or you will die
Warning tonight
So here comes the Fury
Screaming and burning the streets
Keep that alive
And never say never or you will die
