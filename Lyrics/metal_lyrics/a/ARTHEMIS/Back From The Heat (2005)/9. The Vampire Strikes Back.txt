Ha Ha Ha Haaaa...

Full Moon in the sky
You remember that night
Damnation will last forever
Fear's in the air
No you can't break that spell
He is coming and you'll better run

Burn in Hell!

The right time to kill
The right day to die
Beware of the attack of the assassin
Echoes of fear
Make a war in my ears
Surrounding and stealing mind

The snaring bark of the werewolf
Will give him the perfect sign
Some heads are gonna roll
Drinking your blood he will arise

Run, run for your life, so overnight
You'll beat the liar
Strive, you cannot hide
You cannot fail never say die

[Solo]

He will hurt your neck
Then steal you in the back
So don't expect him to be trustful
He's a creature of hell
And no one will tell
Him to stop rushin' on men

The snaring bark of the werewolf
Will give him the perfect sign
Some heads are gonna roll
Drinking your blood he will arise

Run, run for your life, so overnight
You'll beat the liar
Strive, you cannot hide
You cannot fail, never say die
Run, run for your life, so overnight
You'll beat the liar
Strive, you cannot hide
You cannot fail, you got the right
