Down underground the Circle Of Madness
Gather to rise the Ancient Rome
Trying to give a new life to the great Evil Lords
Cyborgs and monsters together
They want to make slaves and let war prevail
Don't know a way to survive
Got to try again and again

We cannot stay, got to find a solution
Breaking the chains, standing up
We need something strong for the revolution tonight
All you can do is to believe
In your heart you can stop the children cry
Today is the time for the fight
Please don't deny

You'll always remember that
This struggle never ends
Remember you'll never be alone
The giants of war got to fall

In a world full of madness
Only your heart can save us
Now that the war is gonna come to the end
Let our dream be forever
Turn this hell to heaven
Run for our life, we'll follow you

[Solo]

The gods are running with you
And the dream's gonna come true
The miracle will save the earth
And Rome will burn down again

In a world full of madness
Only your heart can save us
Now that the war is gonna come to the end
Let our dream be forever
Turn this hell to heaven
Run for our life, we'll follow you

I know you are hearing the call
Stand up heading for tomorrow
