A shout in the night
It's time for a fight
No matter what's wrong or right
I'm breaking the crack
It's time to raise hell
Get ready for my revenge
I'm dark in my mind
But never say die
So many times I have died
I wanna you to live forever
In my world of nightmare

You all will cry for mercy
Kneel down, be free from sins
I wanna hear your voices scream

Rise up from the ashes, never stop the row
But I don't wanna cry and see my city burn
Rise up from the ashes now
You will jump when time is right for you
Rise up from the ashes coming through the night
Make your burning arrows, ready for the fight
All we know that you're the Devil in disguise

[Solo]

I can't feel the sorrow
I can't feel the pain
And feeling the heat again
Wherever I see
Just wanna see flames
And build a new world of hate
I'm nasty and cruel
So this is the truth
No way to change my aim
The ground will burn
I'm running to a point of no return

You all will cry for mercy
Kneel down, be free from sins
I wanna hear your voices scream

Rise up from the ashes, never stop the row
But I don't wanna cry and see my city burn
Rise up from the ashes now
You will jump when time is right for you
Rise up from the ashes, never stop the row
But I don't wanna cry and see my city burn
Rise up from the ashes now
You will jump when time is right for you
