Take my hand and don't fear my strong hold
And let me introduce you to my world
Reaching for a new horizon
You'll find a garden full of hope
The land where you come from

Show your pride and let your spirit ride
You gotta find a way to free your mind
Don't you worry about the future
Running faster than the speed of light

Don't choose temptation from the crystal ball
We've got to stop and fight 'em all
To make the journey home

Break all the rules tonight
Try to be a free spirit and never cry
Take a look in through the clouds
You will see a brand new dawn
The time to break free is right now

[Solo]

Break all the rules tonight
Try to be a free spirit and never cry
Take a look in through the clouds
You will see a brand new dawn
The time to break free is right now
Break all the rules tonight
Try to be a free spirit and never cry
Take a look in through the clouds
You will see a brand new dawn
The time to break free is right now
