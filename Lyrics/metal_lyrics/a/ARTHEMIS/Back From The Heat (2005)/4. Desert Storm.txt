When night 'll come down, got no place to run,
And only the wish to survive will wake up a riot in the sky
Don't wait for so long, we're ready to explode,
Come on follow us through our ride to the land of the dreams,

Break out the sky, we've got to come back,
Tear down the wall and run for the attack!

We're stronger than steel, a volcano's scream
The red fire powder will burn the Evil and rise to set you free
The eye of the snake put the poison in your veins
The black veil of darkness will never fall and reign

We ride over the Sun to find a new life to live
Ready to fly, screaming like never before

Like a Desert Storm we're on the run to spread our force within
Children of a world that lives for our right and never stops

[Solo]

We ride over the Sun to find a new life to live
Ready to fly, screaming like never before

Like a Desert Storm we're on the run to spread our force within
Children of a world that lives for our right and never stops
Like a Desert Storm I'm touching the sky, we leave or we'll die
Children of a world that lives for our right and never stops
Forever and ever we'll see the dawn

Desert Stooooooorm...
