And now that I'm alone
I find so hard keep goin'on
Watching the tide I'm still crying
You were waiting for the Sun to shine

Look down deep in your heart
Thinking that you'll always be mine
Put our secrets in the sea
Save our love as it always will be

You left a hole into my soul
And I've got to be strong
Waiting for a new tomorrow

Can you hear it in the wind it is the Ocean's call
Can you feel the northern Sun spreading light so far
In the darkness of the night we'll never stop
Finding our heaven and carrying on

[Solo]

You left a hole into my soul
And I've got to be strong
Waiting for a new tomorrow

Can you hear it in the wind it is the Ocean's call
Can you feel the northern Sun spreading light so far
In the darkness of the night we'll never stop
Finding our heaven and carrying on
And our lives will join as one for all days
I still hear your voice
Forever we'll find a place to stay
