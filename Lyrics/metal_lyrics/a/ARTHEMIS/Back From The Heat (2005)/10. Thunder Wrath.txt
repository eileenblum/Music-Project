When I look into the fire
I feel the thunder wrath inside my soul
Still searching for an answer more and more

I'm walking in the shadows
Don't wanna hide forever
Found something to believe in
I'll never have to give in

The roaring thunder screaming
Electrifies my feelings
The heart beat keeps on growin'
And feelings start to join as one

Down inside my mind's eternal war
I will go and feel the force When I look into the fire
I feel the thunder wrath inside my soul
Still searching for an answer more and more
Let the call of the wild
Rule the world tonight
And raise your hand up to the sky

[Solo]

When you see over the mountains
Fields of gold
You won't believe your eyes
Watch the storm dividing skies and hear the thunder roar

The lightning gives you power
Still shockin' what is ours
The burning eyes break out the darkest night
And my feelings still join as one

Down inside my mind's eternal war
I will go and feel the force

When I look into the fire
I feel the thunder wrath inside my soul
Still searching for an answer more and more
Let the call of the wild
Rule the world tonight
And let the fire burn into your mind
When I look into the fire
I feel the thunder's calling in my soul
Still searching for an answer more and more
Let the call of the wild
Rule the world tonight
Burning eyes, burning eyes
