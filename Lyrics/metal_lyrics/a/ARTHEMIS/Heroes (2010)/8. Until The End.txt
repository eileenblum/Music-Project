[A. Martongelli]

You, little boy
Want you tell me why you feel alone
Hey you, can you hear me?
Want you tell me
Why you're lost in this cruel world

We all live in a world apart
Under a dark fallen sky

Little brother, in our land
Peace is something to forget
Hear the wind blow
Close your eyes,
See the future's in your hands

Give us a shining brand new Sun
Until the day will come for

You, you were born
In a world full of lies
You feel reborn
And together we'll stand until the end

The dream never ends
And we'll fly away o yeeeeah

You..Don't you cry
In the land
Of broken dreams you fall apart
Don't deny me
Hold me close,
Let your fear turn to dust

Give us a shining brand new Sun
Until the day will come for

You, you were born
In a world full of lies
You feel reborn
And together we'll stand until the end
You, you were born
In a world full of lies
You feel reborn

And together we'll stand until the end
