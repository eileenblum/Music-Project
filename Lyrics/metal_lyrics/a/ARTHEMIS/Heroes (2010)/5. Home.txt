[A. Martongelli]

Been left alone in blood and shame
I see the aliens come my way
Rejected by my friends
So far away

Out of sight and out of touch
I wonder if it's just too much
My memories will fade to black
And I'm afraid to come back

I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding
Much stronger, believing I can
See my world again

We are coming all the way from the Sun
We are searching for our way to home

A ray of light gives me hope
I'm sick and tired please take me home
I see my Earth from miles and miles away

I take a breath and suffocate
They tear me down to kill the day
I watch my fear become my god
But I don't wanna sleep no more

I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding
Much stronger, believing I can
See my world again

We are coming all the way from the Sun
We are searching for our way to home

I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding
Much stronger, believing I can
See my world again

We are coming all the way to the Sun
We are searching for our way
Always keep on dreaming
We will stand as one
We are searching for our way to home
