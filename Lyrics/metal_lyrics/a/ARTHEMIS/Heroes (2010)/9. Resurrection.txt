[A. Martongelli]

I watch myself and ask you
Will there be an end to misery
I feel I'm gonna cry in pain
I see my life on the edge
I realize, sometimes I feel paralized
No one is like you
You give me all the strength I need
You make me feel complete

I fear one day they're gonna
See the world in flames
But I'll do it my way
If this is the price to pay
It makes me I don't wanna stay
Terrorized
Don't fear to be crucified
I know the truth
There's nothing, nowhere else to roam
Welcome to the real world

Rise living in confusion
From slaves of the illusion
Death if this is the price to pay
I just wanna fly away

Now that a world's about to fall
I can see the stranger in us all
All I wanna do is pray for resurrection
Even is the end is getting near
Try to pull me down I've got no fear
Nail me to the cross I'll wait for resurrection

I know the rules
Sometimes I've been playin' the fool
I feel alone
I fear I'm gonna lose my faith
You take the spell out of me
Stub my back
All sorts of Judas feeling wrath
I know the way
I'm here on the run again
No more easy game to play

Rise living in confusion
From slaves of the illusion
Death if this is the price to pay
I just wanna fly away

Now that a world's about to fall
I can see the stranger in us all
All I wanna do is pray for resurrection
Even is the end is getting near
Try to pull me down I've got no fear
Nail me to the cross I'll wait for resurrection
