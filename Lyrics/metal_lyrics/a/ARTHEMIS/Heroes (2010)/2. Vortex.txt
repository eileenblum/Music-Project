[A. Martongelli]

Winds of confusion
In a world of illusion
Tell me what you do to survive
Lies and corruption
Generate a chain reaction
Burning down, ravishing my head

Swimming into phobia
While the people just ignore ya
Hearing evil voices calling me
No more way to follow
No more yesterday and tomorrow
Strive, bring this nightmare to an end

Yes I am wrong
But I won't regret my world without it

Wake wake me up
Wake me up
Is it a dream or a nightmare?
Wake wake me up
Through thunders and lightnings
Calling at my name
Before I lose my strength

Aliens and preachers
Wicked men and funny creatures
Hunting me, knockin' at my door
Wicked revolution
Bleeding hands, blood pollution
Take me into a vortex killing me

Wake wake me up
Wake me up
Is it a dream or a nightmare?
Wake wake me up
Through thunders and lightnings
Calling at my name
Before I lose my strength
