[A. Martongelli]

Down in the dirt into a world of hate
Blaming the sky for all we created
Over and all they paralize your fate
Hearing the sound. The sound of misery
Venomous tongues, a world of agony
Never again this game is changing me

Over the hill, nothing more to see
Livin' a war, the world is crumbling
Nothing is safe, the sun bleeds again

Keeping the faith until we disappear
Shivers of hate, repent, blood and tears
Give me a sign to get away from here

Always tryin' to kill the day
I'm falling down
No way to turn around
But only know that

Scars on scars, scars on scars
Life's all scars on scars
I'm bleeding
Scars on scars, scars on scars
Life's all scars on scars
I'm falling
Scars on scars, scars on scars
Life's all scars on scars
Release me
Scars on scars, scars on scars
Release me from this pain

Always tryin' to kill the day
I'm falling down
No way to turn around
But only know that

Scars on scars, scars on scars
Life's all scars on scars
I'm bleeding
Scars on scars, scars on scars
Life's all scars on scars
I'm falling
Scars on scars, scars on scars
Life's all scars on scars
Release me
Scars on scars, scars on scars
Release me from this pain
...Scars on scars
