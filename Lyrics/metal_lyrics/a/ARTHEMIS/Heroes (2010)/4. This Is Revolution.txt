[A. Martongelli]

REVOLUTION

I wash my face to get away from madness
Get away, this is the land of sadness
Liars, and politicians
Down from your thrones
We fight and stand as one

We drop the coin for our destination
Just like toys of this infected nation
No more feel the pain,
Ready for a civil war
The truth has to be told

We don't know submission
We are slaves of your crimes
Out of this prison
We're running
To the left and to the right

This is revolution for all humanity
This is revolution, tonight

Ready for the revolution...

I feel reborn, I see the world's on fire
No time to run you're telling lies to liars
A sign from the distance
From the lord of war
Oh can you hear the call?

We don't know submission
We are slaves of your crimes
Out of this prison
We're running
To the left and to the right

This is revolution for all humanity
This is revolution, tonight

This is revolution baby
