[A. Martongelli]

I see from my window
Black ice, firestorm
A scream breaks the silence
They cry for their souls

But lights will turn down on the streets
And there's nothing you can do
Too young to die, too blind to see
This is all we need

Another hero, another hero
To give the new life to the world
Another hero, a new tomorrow
Leading us to a brave new world

I see people screaming
But can't hear their call
They give me their warning
I won't stay no more

But lights will turn down on the streets
And there's nothing you can do
Too young to die, too blind to see
This is all we need

Another hero, another hero
To give the new life to the world
Another hero, a new tomorrow
Leading us to a brave new world

But lights will turn down on the streets
And there's nothing you can do
Too young to die, too blind to see
This is all we need

Another hero, another hero
To give the new life to the world
Another hero, a new tomorrow
Leading us to a brave new world
