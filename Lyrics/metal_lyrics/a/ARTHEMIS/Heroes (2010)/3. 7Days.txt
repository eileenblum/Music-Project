[A. Martongelli]

You will never bring me down
I'm lost between the sounds
Of all the pain I'm goin' through
I feel annihilate
Will never lose the faith
Until I die in this cold grave

Never give up
I live for tomorrow
Why don't you understand?

Why don't you give it a break
For a bunch of dollars
Give it a break there's only 50 hours
Give it a break but you're too blind to see
There's only seven days, seven days
Give it a break, stop the reign of terror
Give it a break you know it's now or never
Tell us the things we're not supposed to say
Only seven days, seven days

You, you're the one to blame
Crawling like a snake
I won't let you touch me anymore
Scream, treat me like a slave
There's only seven days
Until they'll come and take you
Down into the flames

Never give up
I live for tomorrow
Why don't you understand?

[CHORUS]

Give it a break for a bunch of dollars
Give it a break there's only fifty hours
Give it a break, stop the reign of terror
Give it a break
Give it a break, give it a break, give it a break
Why don't you give it a break
For a bunch of dollars
Give it a break, there's only 50 hours
Give it a break but you're too blind to see

[CHORUS]
