Dancing around like we're marionettes 
A stutter in our step
A cadence in our breath
To the unimpressed

I painted myself into a hole
I gave up my heart to find a soul
Acquit my crimes but still cast your stones
The pigs eat filth because it's all they know

And the crowds want more
There's no silence before the storm
The clouds came in and the lights went out
We were guided by the roar

So step inside, find your light
When the scavengers come be ready to fight
The promise is now at the edge of a knife 
And when the blood spills you'll know you're alive

And the crowds want more
They want violence before the storm
The clouds came in and the lights went out
We were guided by the roar

You are owned nothing

We want an easy fix
Snake oil burns too quick
Daggers of ill intent 
With malice towards the heaven sent

Give me the rope
I'll tie me down
Give me the rope
I'll hang around

Safe bet, mindset
Remove the spine and the heart
Safe bet, mindset
And claim what's left as art

Give me the rope
I'll tie me down
Give me the rope
