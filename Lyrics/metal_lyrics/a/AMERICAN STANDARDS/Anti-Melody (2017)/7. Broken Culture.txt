We're free to hear the only thing being said
To regurgitate all the lies being fed
When there's no difference between living and dead
We're blueprint human beings

But don't let them catch you with nothing to say
The deaf and the blind can get carried away
It's a sick world and we've welcomed on the plague

If we're the sum of all parts
It's a whole fucked up world that we live in
Unforgivable
Unforgiven 

But don't let them catch you with nothing to say
The deaf and the blind can get carried away
It's a sick world and we've welcomed on the plague

We thought we had it figured out
But we know nothing at all
We thought we had it figured out
We're just cattle for the new slaughterhouse 

We had more guns than bullets
So we made pistols with our hands
Where there's good there's evil we must fear
So pull the trigger and pray the rounds land

We don't need another branded revolution
Or rehashed poetry 
We don't need another echo in the hall
With no one to disagree
