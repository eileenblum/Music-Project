My father was a working man
He worked all his life until he died
He fought for everything he had
I was the last to say goodbye

The shadow is behind me
At the the edge of every light
Calm me down, this uncertainty
Each day gives way to night

I need noise, please give me noise
Break the silence, fill the void

I held my breath for hours
Exhale

And you end where I began
We won't ever meet again

I'll never know the answers to the questions left unsaid
A weight I can't shed pulls me down

How much more must I give
To realize what I have

We're taken hostage by the ones we love
That leave us behind

I can't be tough as nails 
With this paper skin
And organs that fail
But life will moves on
And I'll go on too

My father was a working man
He worked all his life until he died
He fought for everything he had
I was the last to say goodbye
My father was a working man
He worked all his life until he died
I lived like him
I'll die like him
Remember me, remember
