Concrete minds cannot change
Don't stand still, keep moving
You'll become what you say you hate 
Concrete minds, they never change

Time marches on to early graves yet to be dug
I've got the shovel but what I lack is motivation

Nothing waits for me nor I for it
Self imposed paralysis 

The no movement, movement

Time marches on to early graves yet to be dug
I've got the shovel but what I lack is motivation
