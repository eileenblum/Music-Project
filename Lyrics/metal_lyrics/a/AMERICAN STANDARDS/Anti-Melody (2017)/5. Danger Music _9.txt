You make a beautiful statistic, diamond eyes 

Giving incentives to move these units 
Prescribe more illness

And we'll become 
the money they count behind closed doors

A half a million dead
A third of us next
Where's the accountability?

Dehumanizing the masses
Blank faces, clear conscious 
Disconnected criminals robbing the weak
Taking advantage of us all

A complex system
That we've instilled
We treat the systems 
Just take the pill!

When people become numbers
We'll live counting our dead
And die watching the clock
From our hospital bed
