We've inherited the debt of poor decisions
At the price of life, at the price of love
And we've given in to a cowards demand
Exchanging our time for distraction 
While eating right out of their hands

Give us the shackles, we'll find the wall

I want to believe that fear is only skin deep
And when staring at the beast
What's looking back is no more than I am
Both trying to understand 
I start on the other side
Try to find common ground
When hate fights hate the ugly wins
It's a deafening sound

But we can overcome

Open hearts, open minds
Open hearts, no confines
Torn apart, dehumanized
Open hearts, open minds

I want to believe that fear is only skin deep
And when staring at the beast
What's looking back is no more than I am
Both trying to understand 

We're all trying to understand
