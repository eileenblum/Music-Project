We were not meant for this world
We're instilled with sadness
Equipped with inherent disease
And inevitable loneliness 

We were not meant for this world 
Our minds are wanders
Chasing what we can't have
Regretting what we don't chance

But the pain doesn't leave when we cease to exist
Hard times are coming, hard times
It's inherited by the ones we leave behind
Hard times are coming, hard times

We were not meant for this world
We live distracted
Caught in our past mistakes
And unpromised future 

We were not meant for this world
And the constant struggle
Caught in the circumstance
A choice we never had 

But the pain doesn't leave when we cease to exist
Hard times are coming, hard times
It's inherited by the ones we leave behind
Hard times are coming, hard times

We carve our path through trails of failure

But the pain doesn't leave when we cease to exist
Hard times are coming, hard times
It's inherited by the ones we leave behind
Hard times are coming, hard times
