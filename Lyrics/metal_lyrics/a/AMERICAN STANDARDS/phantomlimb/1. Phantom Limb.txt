Dire, dire stakes around you
I can't hear you with your head under the sand
But I can feel you breathing

Breath in, breath in fill your chest
The air is free but they'll take the rest
Pay to prey at church on Sunday

Zombie, zombie living the life
I've stabbed my heart but I can't feel the knife
And oh god damn I'm twisting

Father, son and the Holy Ghost
One gun, two bullets who wants it the most
And I'll always put my money on the bastard

If the stains my blood
Then I'm not regretting it
If the signals from hell
Then you know I'm sending it
Oh can see the teeth marks
From their bite

The well was dry before I spit into it
Soak up all my courage and grit
Determination I'll never quit
I'll never quit, I'll never quit
I'll never quench

Clench the sun like pearls on a necklace
That's my light to protect and shine on this
But in this age I'm getting more unfit
To judge any new shadow
And that scares me a bit

We're dusting off our old beliefs
With venom between tongue and teeth
We sing along
To a sirens song
A rehashed verse
The words all wrong

The well was dry before I spit into it
Soak up all my courage and grit
Determination I'll never quit
I'll never quit, I'll never quench

I'll never quit
I'll never quench
I'll never quit
And with this thirst I'll never quench
