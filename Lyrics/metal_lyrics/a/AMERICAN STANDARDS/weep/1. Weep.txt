I am the ghost
Haunts of the past
Confined to thoughts
Of lost happiness
I have been dragged deeper
Into the void

Will this end
This grief inside for what I once held
Time must change
Reaching for more from the bottom I dwell
All I hope
That this emptiness will soon pass
Happiness
A feeling of purpose I pray I can grasp

Reborn
Revive
I fight for a new life

All I wanted
Was to know of a purpose to feel like I belong
But knowing there was no support from you for so long

You linger
In the empty space inside my mind
All I want
Fight to distort what's engraved in my eyes
Solitude
A constant companion all to familiar
I reach out
Being dragged deeper into the void

I struggle
I struggle
I struggle
I struggle

Every time I feel like I'm making progress
There's always a constant reminder
That dims the light
That shuts a door
That puts more weight on these shoulders
I'm left crawling through life
Hoping to reach a place of contentment
But I'm lost
