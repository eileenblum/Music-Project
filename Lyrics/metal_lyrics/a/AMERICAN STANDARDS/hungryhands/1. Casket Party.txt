Tell me the beat has gone missing
Tell me the sirens aren't lying
Feet fail and lips laced with whiskey
Death is cold but so is the void inside

And when the clock
Hits the 2
I'll take just one more drink
And savor till it's through

The dead don't dance
So I know I'm alive [3x]

But when song ends
Will I survive

We've shed our skin we were hiding in
(We shed, we shed our skin)
Our bones bleached white
Our hearts worn thin

We've become the framework of a disaster

Oh, the hollowed out eyes
Of all the scarecrows
They keep our shadows
Keep our shadows at bay

Oh, the hollowed out eyes
Of all the scarecrows
They aren't so threatening
When we know how they're made

I hear the heart beats cut through the night air
And when I wake, i fear this feeling won't be here
If we don't don't go to sleep
This night won't end
If we don't don't go to sleep
This night will never end

I won't close my eyes
I'll let the sirens carry me home

Death grips me a little tighter
We made it through another day
