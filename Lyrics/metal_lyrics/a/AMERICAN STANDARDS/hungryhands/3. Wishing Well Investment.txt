Dancing around
Like we're marionettes
A stutter in our step
A cadence in our breath
To a crowd of the unaffected and unimpressed

What do you mean

"Just how did we get here?"

I painted myself into a hole
I gave up my heart to find some sort of soul
And when acquitted of all my crimes
I'll be casting the swine pearls and stones

When this loss is all that I know
And I've got no where else to go
Won't you invite me in
So I can gut out your home for all that you own

With bloodthirsty daggers and ill intent

What have you done for me lately
