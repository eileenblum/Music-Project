I had the perfect picture
To bring the world to its knees
But when the people heard of art
They couldn't see the forest for the trees
And I want to feel to earth shake
Every bone left rattling
And I want to feel I'm awake
From a people fast asleep

Mirrors facing mirrors

Can't break away from this
Can't break away
And of the ill equipped we're armed to the teeth

It goes around, around, around, around and ends now

Replace my sweat and tears with gasoline
And let this fire burn for all to see

Mirrors facing mirrors
And now we're stuck

Replace my sweat and tears with gasoline
And let this fire burn for all to see

Replace my sweat
Replace my tears

Oh, Time
My mistress
And patience, my disease
My heart, my love, my passion guide me
