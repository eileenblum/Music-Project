You've been hand fed/Then misled/You've been beating the horse because you don't want to die all alone/Who is worse/The one who's feeding you lies/Or you for just swallowing them whole/Raised by wolves/We've been raised by wolves/Thoughts worming inward/Am I the hunter or the hunted/I guess we'll find out the answer when we're both dead/My heart, my compass/My coup de grace/We fought for so much more but always settle for so much less/The dream is over.
