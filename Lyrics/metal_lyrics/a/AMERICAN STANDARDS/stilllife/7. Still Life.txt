We took two separate paths but we didn't meet in the middle/No, sometimes it feels we're right back where we began/Disappointed at an endless world of impossibilities and the overwhelming obstacles along the way/Facing barricades that warn do not pass/Shattered dreams like broken glass/So we shrug it all off and get on with a laugh/I take one step forward for each two steps back/I'm constantly moving but not getting anywhere/So I start running just to stay in place/We are more than what we have become/We aren't mirror images of what we're supposed to be/When I thought I had hit the bottom, you handed me a shovel/But maybe, baby we were buried from the beginning/Oh, I feel I've been digging 26 years just to get to ground level/So I climb and I climb to get to rock bottom/Sometimes I feel I'm stuck in the still life.
