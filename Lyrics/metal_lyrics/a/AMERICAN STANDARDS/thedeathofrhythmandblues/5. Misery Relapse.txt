I speak these words
With a serpents tongue
Like the iron lung I'm confined to this
I shed my skin
With a sirens kiss
Our mouths closed tight

Oh my friend, the guillotine
Has the harshest bite
But when she's right
I should of packed my bags
Left my head behind
Cause these thoughts are what keep me up at night

I've got this hell to pay
but my pockets have been emptied
Oh, I've sang the blues till I was blue in the face

As I delve to new depths
Indebted to each and every breath

Hearts on fire
Sparks fly from my mouth
As Dreams expire
I'm handed my ticket out
These old bones still move
So I'll sing my discontent
Until my lungs collapse

Break through these concrete hearts

This idea holds no ghost

It's so easy to drown with this weight at your feet

Hearts on fire
Sparks fly from my mouth
As Dreams expire
I'm handed my ticket out
These old bones still move
So I'll sing my discontent
Until my lungs collapse

(Hearts on fire)
With heavy hands and a heavy heart
I knew the words but not how to start
So I built my bridge over a lake of fire
So when I fell the crowd could admire
With no urgency in our glare
we found ourselves collapsing into old habits
Dancing with depression, pulling flesh from the bone
May my heartache be your home
And one by one we'll fall from this cliff
Waiting our turn just because there's a line
Living life between these blackouts
oh, how the cockroaches scatter from the light
(With our Hearts on fire)
