I canât believe Iâm the only one that makes plans
Weakened by the trouble of the others
Lost in this mug that slowly swallows me
I hold on knowing that everyone is like meâ¦

They say: âThereâs a way out!â
Iâd rather be deaf so I canât hear them
Always remember what youâre aiming at
Itâs a pity that you lost the meaning of it

I canât believe Iâm the only one that makes plans
Weakened by the trouble of the others
Lost in this mug that slowly swallows me
I hold on knowing that everyone is like meâ¦

Shadow, itâs not my fault if Iâm this wayâ¦
My paranoia grows thanks to the
nothingness that is my life
Still carrying on in what I amâ¦
My shadowâ¦
