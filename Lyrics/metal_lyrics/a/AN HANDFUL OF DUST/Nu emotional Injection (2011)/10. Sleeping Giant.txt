And they burn our flag again
âCause they canât understand the meaning of it
I wonât be a fake

Listen to me
âCause I want to tell you
What normal people sees everyday
I canât feel whatâs going on here
And what they fucked up are my senses
My mother cannot know
What her son wants to do
My father lost his job too

Ideals are dead
Were sold for a fistful of money
They need your vote, man
To make you believe you choose
Between the black and the other black
Itâs all a fake since lots of years
This illusion will vanish with the revolution

Our tree canât fall
The sleeping giant canât sleep no more
We have the power inside our soul
To raise our minds and our world

Y la gente, le persone
And the people, les personness

Our tree canât fall
The sleeping giant canât sleep no more
We have the power inside our soul
To raise our minds and our world

Society canât understand
What is good and what is bad
We know what we want
We donât want to soil ourselves with hate

No more petrol
No more hate
No more war
No more sorrow
No more war
