Mr. self-made paradigm
Take off your democracy out of our ass

We are the new borderline
We donât need your alms
Pick up your boat, pick up your bitches
And fade away!

We have a power in our mind, a new way to spread our life
New ice age has risen to stole our dreams
We are filling our blank page with a new psalm
Forgetting of you and all the media

No more saints can save us
We canât wait for new wise
We must follow our thoughts
To rise the new millennium prophecy

Triste Italia sprecata
Dal suo popolo senza memoria
Dal suo falso padrone
I fasti di glorie passate
Sono lisi come le pietre dei templi dâorati

We have a power in our mind, a new way to spread our life
New ice age has risen to stole our dreams
We are filling our blank page with a new psalm
Forgetting of you and of all the media
