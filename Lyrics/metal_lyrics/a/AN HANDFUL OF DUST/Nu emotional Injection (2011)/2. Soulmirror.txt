Solitude my enemy,
Like nature that made me of sand

Looking at the horizon, my body is taken by the wind
The sun looks at my shadow
Staring at the ground I understand Iâm alone
Turning to the sky I found the nature of spirit

Inside my past I see my cries
You are the girl of the last night
My only one my one true love
And with your kiss I begin to fly

I blame myself for my blindness
Iâm rising my eyes now that lifeâs gone
I deny my being
Leaving the sand along my path

Inside my past I see my cries
You are the girl of the last night
My only one my one true love
And with your kiss I begin to fly

I hear the sound of my last steps
Finally my soul his taking shape

Looking back at my past I see my trails
And I begin to fly
Gladly I embrace my dream
And I get lost into the infinity of my thoughts
