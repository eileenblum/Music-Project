Oblivion rest in my arms, doors slam me outside
Time plays his notes, for me like pulses of life
Time slowly decays when this houses are changing again
Tunes of their hate are calling me
Our shell is broken my friend, I say
Imprint what you see, before they shut your eyes

[Pre-chorus]
The enemy watches me
As in life I fight a battle that
Iâve not chosen
Gone blank eyes
In the desert that dries my mouth
I understand that Iâve killed
Iâve killed

And I see the hands of my mother
My hands shake the faces of my belovedâ¦
â¦ones, these are only pictures
And in this sad story fate laughs

Now Iâm a murderâ¦
Blackened rays flow in this streets
Iâm here, nothing seems the same
Something is missing, is this real or
Just the incarnation of what Iâve done?

And I seeâ¦

[Bridge]
Echoes of vanished lights
I breathe a dissolved life
And it's  only mine
Nothing has a purpose
