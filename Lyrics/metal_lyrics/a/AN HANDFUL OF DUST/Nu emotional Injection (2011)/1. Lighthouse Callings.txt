Leave alone the one and the reefs
And join my misery,
I need to put on track my life
Are you going to lend a hand to me?
This is not a joke, Iâm drowning

[Pre-chorus]
You are the only one that can understand
We share the same problems and disasters
Why are we still sitting there
why they are already flying?

Right now
you should jump with us!
world wonât stop for us
As you perceive
a second moon
Donât stop, scream until you got

[Bridge]
Their stupid voices
are hitting us
Is this the energy?
Is this the magic?
Letâs enter another place,
here no one gets bored

Right now
you should jump with us!
We are free in this night
The world wonât stop for us
As you perceive
thereâs a second moon
Follow her, itâs our way
Donât stop, scream until you got
