Did you wonder if they would have remembered you?
Tonight it rains and days have passed since food is overâ¦
Someone said that theyâve betrayed you
Is the world bad today? Surely itâs more hypocrite

The callback of your voice
Hits me in my lonely nights
Itâs time to depart
To fight or vanish

I donât think Iâm strong
How many think to be someone...
We miss the fight that can unite us
They think to have the right...

The only think that you can do
Itâs to carry in our hearts
The meaning of the struggle
The voice isolated by now it
Cannot resist oblivion
Surely I will never ââ¦loose tendernessâ

The calling of your voice
Hits me in my lonely night
Itâs time to depart
To fight or vanish
