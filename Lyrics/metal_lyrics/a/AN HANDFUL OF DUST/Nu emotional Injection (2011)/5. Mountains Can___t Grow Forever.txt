Iâm still facing this alone
Trying to stay on track
Although I met this before
Although they warned me
Although the wind shown me another way

I needed to hurt myself to understand
That again you used me

The shaking of my nerves
The scratching of my nails
Make me sense the poison you put in me
Stunned by your abuses

Everyone faces the great wasteland
Everywhere, day after day

You said that Iâm not good enough
But you  never listen to me
Only âcause you could do this
You insulted me,  you humbled meâ¦
Whatâs left of me now that you
Took away my dignity?

Mountains canât grow forever
