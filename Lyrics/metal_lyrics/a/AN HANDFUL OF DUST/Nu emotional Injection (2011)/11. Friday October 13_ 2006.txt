Day seems always the same
Like the looks of people that blame me
Hopes remained in my sleep
Unaware of whatâs going to happen to me
I face dawn as usual
I go downstairs to have some coffee,
And I feel more imprisoned
I go out for a walk, light up a smoke
(Iâm not dressed up, he stares at me
I cannot take this anymore I need a free place)

Fuck this day I want to scream, âtill my soul becomes free
will he ever be free?
Iâm pissed off with everything, with myself and with you
I hate you allâ¦
There will ever be a day when all this changes?
When the grey is no more
Donât fool yourself, surely is not gonna be the thirteenth of October

Trapped in my dreams I live
Can you hear my cry? [x2]
I can hear your lies
This hell is burning
I cab hear your lies [x2]
Can you hear my cry?

I canât stand this people anymore
Why Iâm still here, staring at the emptiness
(I realize) this land and sky donât belong to me
I canât find the strength to break this chains

Itâs time to go
To pack my stuff
And donât  look back
Yeah, rightâ¦ Itâs late now,
time to return back home

Fuck this day I want to screamâ¦.
