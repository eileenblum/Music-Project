Pity the living, more than the dead
These worries that kill you are all in your head
Realizing that nothing's left in this world
This is the day where you learn that death has a toll

Set yourself free so you can experience the truth
Your heart is beating, but you are not alive
How can you say that you know the truth, when all you've been told is a lie?

My face hits the floor and I'm on the pavement
I refuse to forgive and I refuse to repent
Nothing can fill this emptiness of mine
Everything is out of fucking line

These worries, they kill you,
These worries are all in your head
In your head!

Uneasy [4x]

I contain this pain to myself
I have nobody else
I am empty inside and out
Suppressing my urge to scream and shout
Suppressing my urge to scream and shout
