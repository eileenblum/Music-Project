I am the sum of all that I have done
I'm haunted by these inactions
And what I've become

I'd give everything to feel nothing at all! 

How could I have come so far to forget where I've come from
I risked my life for this
Now I'm picking up pieces of broken bones
From a broken home!

I'd give everything to feel nothing at all! 
How could this slip through my fingertips?
I never meant for this
In my mind I know I will be free
It won't get the best of me - won't be the death of me

I've lost everything
Now I fear nothing at all

How could I have come so far to forget where I've come from?
I risked my life for this, now I'm picking up pieces of broken bones
How could I have come so far to forget where I've come from?
I risked my life for this
Now I'm picking up pieces of broken bones
From a broken home
