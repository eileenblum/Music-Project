Are you surprised to find that I'm still alive?
You wanted to see me dead but I survived

You best believe there's no honor among these thieves

Hell yeah, you know that I'll stand up and
Fight for my fright to survival 
Hell yeah! Get up, get up!
GET THE FUCK UP AND FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL!

FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT

You best believe there's no honor among these thieves
THERE'S NO HONOR AMONG THESE THIEVES!

Hell yeah, you know that I'll stand up and
Fight for my fright to survival 
Hell yeah! Get up, get up!
GET THE FUCK UP AND FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL!

You best believe there's no honor among these thieves
