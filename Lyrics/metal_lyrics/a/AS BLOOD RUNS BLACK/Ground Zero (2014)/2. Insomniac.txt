I won't fall asleep
I'm gonna stand up and fight
Gripping the wheel so tight
My knuckles turn white with fear

In the distance I can hear the sirens calling
These sleepless nights I lie awake as the floor shakes

Solely responsible for these souls
These sleepless nights
In the distance I can hear the sirens coming
These sleepless nights

Polluted minds
These thoughts are not my own
This is my life
Control the wasteland

Day by day
We bleed the time away
We drink to our health
We think for ourselves
And with smoke-filled lungs
We exhale the truth

Scream our name
Without knowing what we've been through
Scream our name
Are you listening now?

Are you listening?
We bleed for you

Day by day
We bleed the time away
We drink to our health
We think for ourselves
And with smoke-filled lungs
We exhale the truth

Scream our name
Without knowing what we've been through
Scream our name
Are you listening now?

Polluted minds
These thoughts are not my own
This is my life
Control the wasteland

[2x]
We bleed for you
Are you listening?
