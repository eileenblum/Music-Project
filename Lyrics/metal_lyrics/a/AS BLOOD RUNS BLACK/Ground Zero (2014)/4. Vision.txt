I shut my eyes in order to see through all the lies that seem to surround me

So here I am at the precipice again
Am I alive and breathing, or just dreaming in my head?
I lie awake, questioning what I know
To persuade myself, I know exactly what to do!

I shut my eyes in order to see through all the lies that seem to surround me

SHUT YOUR EYES, FUCK YOUR LIES!

It never ends, when my decision is made
I can't control my thoughts, I'm a fucking moth to the flame
It never ends, deep down inside of me, but this is something I know will stay with me

And I just know that this is time to let go now that I can see
That the past is gone and all that's left is dead memories 

Someone please get me out of this place
Blinded by the lies that keep my mind enslaved
OR I WILL SHAKE THE EARTH

I will shake the earth
(chant) SHAKE THE EARTH!
And I will change this world
(chant) CHANGE THIS WORLD!

And I just know that this is time to let go now that I can see
That the past is gone and all that's left is dead memories 

I shut my eyes in order to see through all the lies that seem to surround me

I will shake the earth
(chant) SHAKE THE EARTH!
And I will change this world
(chant) CHANGE THIS WORLD!
