Lately it seems like you're dead behind those eyes
What will it take to breathe new life? [2x]

What would it take to breathe new life?

All that I've killed for is now killing me
This is worth dying for, breathe new life into me!

I've spent my last days that I'll ever waste!

We bare the crashes of a changing tide
But every wave just
Strengthens our stride

And when the currents change we'll have the strength to survive 
And carry on with the rest of our lives
Finally I've found new life!

Lately I've been revitalized 
Finally I've found new life

I've spent my last days that I'll ever waste!

It's time to take control of my life to know my true self a show a true better me
It's time to believe in myself for all that I am and all that I'll ever be

I've spent my last days that I'll ever waste!

It's time to take control of my life to know my true self a show a true better me
It's time to believe in myself for all that I am and all that I'll ever be

I've spent my last days that I'll ever waste!
