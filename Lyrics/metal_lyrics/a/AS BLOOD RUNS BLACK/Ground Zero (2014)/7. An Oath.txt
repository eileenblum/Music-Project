I swear to be alive for the rest of my life

Take it back - from the life that lead me astray
I choose to shed my skin, and free myself from this cage
This cage of memories
They're nothing but pain and illusion
They are not who I am - I am who you see!

Raise your head up and open your eyes
Remember to live before you die

Live before you die!

Take a look - at the thoughts that stand in your way
Simply witness your head lose itself
And break down the walls of your mind
Your mind made reality
It's nothing but pain and illusion
And it's not who you are - you are who I see!

Raise your head up and open your eyes
Remember to live before you die
