This is all I know and I am letting go

Break free from the boundaries
Limitations have no meaning to a man who's forgotten his fears
Living in fear won't get you away from here!
Living in fear- it's all in your head!
So go ahead and

HATE ME - I'll use it to fuel my flame
FREE ME - from this patter it's always the flame
VALIDATE ME - for breaking your chains
HATE ME - and continue to fuel the flame

The closer and closer you get
The further you're drifting away
You're drifting from yourself!

And this is who I am, and it's who I've always been!
And this is all I know, and I am letting go!

I'M LETTING GO

As my pockets overflow, it's with or without you

HATE ME - I'll use it to fuel my flame
FREE ME - from this patter it's always the flame
VALIDATE ME - for breaking your chains
HATE ME - and continue to fuel the flame
