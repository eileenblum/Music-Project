In these desperate days where anything goes
We must take back control of this world
This is our time and the time is now
These are the echoes of an era

Remove the barriers â tear this place down
We will succeed where our ancestors failed
Their decline is the start of our rise
The new beginning has arrived

We are the ones that will inherit this earth
With all the problems theyâve left behind â witness the cleansing
And rid this place of the infection that fed on the minds of the weak

We are the ones â that will one day inherit this earth
With all the problems theyâve left behind â witness the cleansing

The time is now â we are next in line to lead this world

What will you do when thereâs no one left to turn to
And all you have left is yourself?
Do you have what it takes to handle the responsibility?

When everything youâve known is gone
Reach outside of your circle
Dividing lines shattered to pieces by a will to unite
In this age we live in of mass communication
Thereâs no limitation on what we can achieve

We are the ones â that will one day inherit this earth
With all the problems theyâve left behind
Witness the cleansing

Will you learn from their mistakes?
Or will you be your own demise?
Looking down at their graves
We can rest in peace now
