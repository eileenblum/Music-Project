Cold winter frost bites my face and hands
As I fall into the darkest night as yet I have known
Mind full of memories makes it's cruel demands
How can I face another hour alone

Is there no hope for me within my misery

Pain bleeding despair
Ceaseless for so long
Many years gone
Longing for release
How can I begin again

Be near me for I am alone
As I fall into the darkest night as yet I have known
Lord be my refuge in this hour of pain
Please bring me glimpses of light through the rain

In my mind can you see black rain falls down on me

Pain bleeding despair
Ceaseless for so long
Many years gone
Longing for release
How can I begin again

I'm still feeling the pain
Longing empty within
For me to die would be release
I long to see my love again

Beloved Lord I know you still hear my cries
I am old and frail and I long to be set free
All that I loved in this life has gone
Reunite us in your arms soon in your kingdom

I can now only see death as freedom for me

Pain bleeding despair
Ceaseless for so long
Many years gone
Longing for release
How can I begin again

Pain bleeding despair
Ceaseless for so long
Many years gone
Longing for release
How can I begin again

As I face this lonely night
Am I wrong longing to leave
If it's your will for me to stay
Lead me finally through this grief

As I face this lonely night
Am I wrong longing to leave
If it's your will for me to stay
Lead me finally through this
Grief
