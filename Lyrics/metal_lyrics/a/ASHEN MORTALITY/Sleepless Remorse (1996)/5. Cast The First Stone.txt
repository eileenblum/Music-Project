Come now cast the first stone where you think I fell away
Accuse with your sharp tongues come judge where I strayed
Ill informed judges with hearts full of scorn
Look away in your disgrace
Seems no one is righteous no not even one mortal

Perfection escapes us
Sin is found in each one of us
No-one is yet perfected
And all flesh becomes dust

Hearts full of wisdom with Christ's love and holiness
Gentle in spirit never curse only bless
And in their example lead those who have strayed
Beckoning weak saints to return
Their lives convicting the ones who have fallen away

Perfection escapes us
Sin is found in each one of us
No-one is yet perfected
And all flesh becomes dust

Judge not lest ye be judged
Bless those who would curse you
Judge not lest ye be judgeed
Curse not lest ye be cursed
As I stoop to cast stones where others have fallen down
Accusing for weakness as though none in me were found
An ill informed judge I with heart full of scorn
I look away in my disgrace
Teach me to be righteous for Lord you are immortal

Perfection escapes us
Sin is found in each one of us
No-one is yet perfected
And all flesh becomes dust
