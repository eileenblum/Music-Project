The haunting distance of the past
The closing in of final days
Fear uncertain life beyond
As woven colours fade to grey

A faded tapestry of memories
Hangs within a lonely mind
Washed to grey by painful tears
Tarnished by the empty years

The haunting distance of the past
The closing in of final days
Fear uncertain life beyond
As woven colours fade to grey

Now can someone as they die
Find hope from words taught as a child
Where once these thoughts of tainted past
Wrought sadness never meant to last

The haunting distance of the past
The closing in of final days
Fear uncertain life beyond
As woven colours fade to grey

And now can someone as they die
Find hope from words taught as a child
Where once these thoughts of tainted past
Wrought sadness never meant to last

Human fragile reaching high
At last the truth elusive found
For this weak body death is nigh
Yet souls believing never die

The haunting distance of the past
The closing in of final days
Fear uncertain life beyond
As woven colours fade to grey
