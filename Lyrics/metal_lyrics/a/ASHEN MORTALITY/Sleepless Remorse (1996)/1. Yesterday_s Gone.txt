Can you stay my children with me
Lost in the past these memories I see
Everyone I used to know
I've seen them all taken they each had to go

You're all I have now I am old
The world outside so bitter cold so bitter cold

Running in fields in summers distant haze
I look back to childhood's long peaceful days
Times in youth where I can never return
I remember so clearly yet at a distance I yearn
If only to step back for a time
To feel but one of the things that I thought would always be mine always be mine

I remember grandmother's face
As she recalled her younger days
She knew deep down as she spoke them to me
Alone in these memories no-one could see
Or feel with her the things she felt
The past seemed so cold my children I feared growing old I feared growing old

Can you stay my children with me
Lost in the past these memories I see
Everyone I used to know
I've seen them all taken they each had to go they had to die

Each time you leave I wish you could stay
Yesterday's gone but I still have today
If tomorrow I leave here and you see me no more
Remember I loved you as you close one more door

Each time you leave I wish you could stay
Yesterday's gone but I still have today
If tomorrow I leave here and you see me no more
Remember I loved you as you close one more door

Yesterday's gone

You're all I have now I am old
The world outside so bitter cold
