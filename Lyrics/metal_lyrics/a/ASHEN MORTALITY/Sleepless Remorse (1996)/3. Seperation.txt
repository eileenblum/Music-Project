Try to survive as you shed many more tears
Darkness once again no refrain
Endless fears
Within your mind still aware
Of the truth and the lies
Spirit willing flesh weak
Again innocence dies

The separation
Crying God leave me

I pray you'll realise
Where many have cried
The once forsaken old man that drove you insane
Has seized you once more and holds you again

The things you once loved
Are sins you've since hated

Where do you turn when you know you're falling
Where can you escape from the pain of failing
It seems as you wake left alone no one hears when you cry
You find you've been used with no one
In which to confide

The separation
Crying God leave me

I pray you'll realise
Where many have cried
The once forsaken old man that drove you insane
Has seized you once more and holds you again

The things you once loved
Are sins you've since hated
But still you return you return

Where can you go where he can't see you
He knows how you fail but still never leaves you
Where can you go where he'll not see you
He knows how you fail but still he believes in you

Forgiveness is real on the cross as blood flowed
He took the sins of the world perfect love shown
The cold empty feeling inside as you have denied
Your love once pure once strong
For the lamb has died

The separation
You can still return

I pray you'll realise
Where many have cried
The once forsaken old man that drove you insane
Has seized you once more and holds you again

The things you once loved
Are sins you've since hated
But still you return
