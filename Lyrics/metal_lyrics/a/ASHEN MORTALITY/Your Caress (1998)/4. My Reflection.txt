You took much more than you'll ever know
Do you remember all those years ago
The stolen trust the lies the fear
Pain you've sown
Memories never let her go

Threw away her innocence she's torn apart inside
You filled this life with emptiness and snatched away her pride
Here she is with little left of who she used to be
Crying in my arms she said
I see my reflection and hate what I see

You threw away her innocence she's torn apart inside
You filled this life with emptiness and snatched away her pride
Here she is with little left of who she used to be
Crying in my arms she said
I see my reflection and hate what I see

All those things you've taken
They can never be replaced

Twisted in your filthiness polluted and depraved
If you could see the scars you've left
Would you tie that millstone around your neck
And throw your selfish life away
Would you throw your selfish life away

Twisted in your filthiness polluted and depraved
If you could see the scars you've left
Would you tie that millstone around your neck
Here she is with little left of who she used to be
Crying in my arms she said
I see my reflection and hate what I see

All those things you've taken
They can never be replaced

You took much more than you'll ever know
Do you remember all those years ago
The stolen trust the lies the fear 
The pain you've sown
Memories never let her go

Years of nightmares
Years of disgust
Self loathing
I pray for healing

Years of nightmares
Years of disgust
Self loathing
I pray for healing

Years of nightmares
Years of disgust
Self loathing
I pray for healing

Years of nightmares
Years of disgust
Self loathing
I pray for healing

I pray for healing
I pray for healing
