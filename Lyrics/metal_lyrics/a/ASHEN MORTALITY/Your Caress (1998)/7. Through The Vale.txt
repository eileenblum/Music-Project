Only you precious one stayed when all else was gone
To be with me again and again
Sheltered from this chilling rain draw near me now
I share your pain come away run with me

Eternity stretches before us as we make our way
Resting for a while in each others arms
Lifting you up I will carry you until you wake
When morning breaks take my hand walk with me

Be with me forever never turn away
Be with me for evermore
Never turn turn away now we've come this far
And it's all worth living for

You were all I had in my world torn apart
You are all I'll ever need
You gave hope to me when my hope was gone
Now we run together through the darkest night

The morning star that lights the way beckons us through weary days
Through the vale of the bleakest winter
A million miles we've travelled with a million more ahead
Every path you tread I will never leave your side

When you see the journey's end and feel the strength to run again
All the pain is just a memory
Look and see how far we've come
Draw near to me
The battles won
Finally we can be free
