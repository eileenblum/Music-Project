My body aches my mind is numb
Is this the way we all become
Lost again with no direction
Broken by this spiritual infection
Broken by this spiritual infection yeah

I'm going down in frustration again
Falling apart is it too late to change
I've been staring outwards from this cage
But looking inward seems impossible at this stage

Lift me up
Strength is slipping away

Nothing feels like it used to now
It seems too far away somehow
As slowly life is turning cold
I wait untill it all unfolds

My body aches my mind is numb
See this fool that I've become
Words of healing you have spoken
Still I'm feeling weak and broken
Still I'm feeling weak and broken

Lift me up 
Take this weight from me
Break this curse
Put your strength within me
