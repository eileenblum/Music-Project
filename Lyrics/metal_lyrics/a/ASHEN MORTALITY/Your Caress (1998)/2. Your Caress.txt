Beauty in your eyes
Kindness in your heart
And the warmth of your caress
Tears me apart
Beauty in your eyes
The depth that you unfold
All the love that you posses
Tears at my soul

The distance I've created
And lost the things so precious
Without the care so deeply needed time and again forgiven
How could I expect you just to forget
Words are insufficient
Hard enough to accept
Except you are still everything to me

Beauty in your eyes
Kindness in your heart
And the warmth of your caress
Tears me apart
Beauty in your eyes
The depth that you unfold
All the love that you posses
Tears at my soul

The distance I've created
And lost the things so precious
And if we go our seperate ways will the depths we shared be lost
A lifetime of regrets is all we can expect
Is there no solution
Is it something we accept
Except you are still everything to me

Beauty in your eyes
Kindness in your heart
And the warmth of your caress
Tears me apart
Tear me apart

I wish I could return and undo the harm I've done
I wish I could come back and replace those things destroyed
I wish we could come back and live again all that has died
But where can we go now my darling
Both alone apart inside

I wish I could return and undo the harm I've done
I wish I could come back and replace those things destroyed
I wish we could come back and live again all that has died
But where can we go now my darling
Both alone apart inside
