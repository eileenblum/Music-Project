Walk again with me
Through the garden
Take my hand
Come away with me
And remember when we walked this way before
One summer

Do you still believe
Do you still remember

Walk again with me
See the beauty
Take my hand
Without the pain
And remember when we walked this way before
In innocence

Do you still believe
Can we ever really return to our eden
