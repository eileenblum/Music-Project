The sweetest love from you offered 
Forced to run so cold where once true love flowed
Regretful tears of sorrow now
Flow freely down and fall to the ground

I cannot bear to see your tears
The harm I have done for all of these years
With sadness now we lay to rest
These old broken bonds of once perfect love
