Why has beauty died
The world has made it all so ugly
Where has love gone
The depth we once knew is now so shallow
Why has beauty died
Where has love gone

Where has purity flown
The world's corrupted seeds are sown
As love is twisted in ugly shame
So many innocent feel the pain
Where has purity flown
Where has love gone

As we see the broken lives
Can we love again
World of pain in empty eyes
Looking out in vain

Can we love again
Return to live in truth and beauty
Purity still remains
For those who look to christ and see
Can we love again
Purity still remains

As we see the broken lives
Can we love again
World of pain in empty eyes
Looking out in vain

As we see the broken lives
Can we love again
World of pain in empty eyes
Looking out in vain
