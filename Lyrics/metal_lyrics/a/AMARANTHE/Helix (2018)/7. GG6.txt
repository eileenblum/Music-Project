Uh!
G-G-6-6-6

You bastard, I'm ripping it faster
Gotta deal with the fact I'm the master
I see you dipping in a stall
Gonna fall through wall
While I stand tall so
FEAR ME
Get in my way, never stay, take it away
Gotta obey, never your way
Gotta chill down, I gotta say

I'm gonna slam the trunk
(Yeah!)
I'm gonna slam the trunk

Oh, you're coming at me and they say that you're crazy
A growling gangster with a tongue like a razor
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated
Not complicated, you're overrated
(Uh!)

To growl like fucking computer is in my genes
Like a mainframe, got a space brain
Like a pacemaker placed in my brain stem
In my basement I hide all you fuckers who
HATE ME
Like I hate motherfuckers with a back-up plan
Like I see you skip in the back
Now gotta back down

Before I slam the trunk
I'm gonna slam the trunk

Oh, you're coming at me and they say that you're crazy
A growling gangster with a tongue like a razor
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated
Not complicated, you're overrated

You're kind of fabricated
And your attitude is frail
Your actions simulated
Going down, down, down boy

I've got dictation within my veins
Like a mutation, and a fixation
On the fucked up rhymes in my narration
Are you getting what I'm saying, fool?
FEAR ME
Get in my way, never stay, take it away
Gotta obey, never your way
Gotta chill down, I gotta say

I'm gonna slam the trunk

Oh, you're coming at me and they say that you're crazy (Crazy)
A growling gangster with a tongue like a razor
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated
Not complicated (Oh!) You're overrated (Oh!)

Oh, you're coming at me and they say that you're crazy (G-G-6-6-6)
A growling gangster with a tongue like a razor (I'm gonna slam the trunk)
From what you said, faked, know why you're hated (G-G-6-6-6)
Not complicated, you're overrated

Uh!
G-G-6-6-6
