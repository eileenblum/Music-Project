365 and a day, that's how you know

The mission is before us, a coded gene inside us
A mathematic function I need, I'm monotonic
Conquering the high life, hiding from the daylight
Sequences are feeding my killing, my correlation

Searching for the borders, a future in disorder
Analog corruption amongst the population
Altering the skyline, delete it from the baseline
365 becoming me, come with me, come with me, come with me

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go
Come with me, come with me
365 and a day to save my soul
Just keep on, let the days go
We keep on telling them no

The mission to divide us will only unify us
The systematic functions erase the anachronic
Plan to set the outline, form you to the hive-mind
Frequencies are seeding your feeding, your automation

Decode the synchronizer, analyze the cipher
A parasitic system that feeds the embryonic
World beneath the high rise, a torment for the sidelined
365, and now you come with me

(Come with me, come with me)
(Follow me, follow me)
(Come with me, come with me)
And bow down before me!

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go
Come with me, come with me
365 and a day to save my soul
Just keep on, let the days go
We keep on telling them no

(3, 6, 5 and a day)

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go
Come with me, come with me
365 and a day to save my soul
Just keep on, let the days go
We keep on telling them no
