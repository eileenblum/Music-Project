Your entertainment, it ain't my style
I am so much more than just a cyberspace delight

Race across all the blazing lights
Get yourself strapped in, we're about to climb
Five five seven seven six six feet
In the stratosphere, where you just can't breathe

You got it, I'm done
Abundance of sin when I come around
I'm going offline
My time is now

Iconic, can hear it calling
If you fall down on your knees
And do just everything we please
Iconic, that's what we call it
If you fall down you will see
What it's like to be iconic
(Uh!)

You're so outrageous
I got a plan
Order and I'll fire up
The clone, the myth, the spam

Crash down burning through the atmosphere
Through the brazen skies without landing gear
Six six six is your number in the line
So save your regrets for another time

You got it, I'm done
I'm going all in for the second round
I'm going offline
Just one more time

Iconic, can hear it calling
If you fall down on your knees
And do just everything we please
Iconic, that's what we call it
If you fall down you will see
What it's like to be iconic
(Uh!)

You got it, I'm done
One last time for the final round
I'm going, so long
And now you're mine

Iconic, can hear it calling
If you fall down on your knees
And do just everything we please
Iconic, that's what we call it
If you fall down you will see
What it's like to be iconic
(Uh!)
