I was lost in a reverie
Your senses designed
For a touch of humanity
A whisper divine

I was forced, pulled out from the great divide
My sanity remade
Like a memory from the other side
Where the radiance never fades

Every single moment is forever
Every little touch is all for you
Our spirits will define
A journey unified
Every single moment lasting
Solitude to sanctity for life
The journey will define
Our spirits unified

I was longing in agony
My road was always long
You created it absently
And so it made me strong

I can flee through the shades
Dance away the rain
When I feel your presence flame
I was long in the dark
And I wondered how
Can I ever be the same?

Every single moment is forever
Every little touch is all for you
Our spirits will define
A journey unified
Every single moment lasting
Solitude to sanctity for life
The journey will define
Our spirits unified

Forever unified
From silent seclusion, I was made to see
When the final curtain falls, I'm not afraid
So let our souls combine
Forever unified

Every single moment is forever
Every little touch is all for you
Our spirits will define
A journey unified
Every single moment lasting
Solitude to sanctity for life
The journey will define
Our spirits unified
