You've told me to keep all my pride to myself
Just hide it away from the others you praised
To the end of my time, I will fight for what's right
A distinction of outbreaks alight

Get caught up inside the moment
In the silence and troubles we faced
But down beneath all of the hatred
Got burned inside the blaze
What you choose to defeat
All the fears I gotta beat
Feel the dark side emerging
From the fear inside of me

So why can't we fall for all what it's worth
What else can you do when you know that you're cursed
Truth is eternal but falsehood comes first
My haven is lost forever
So why won't we fall, can't stop my thirst
Ashes to ashes and dust turns to dirt
Reverse and rewind, cannot stop the tide
My haven is lost forever
My haven!

I'm counting the times when you forced me to hate
Didn't know just how easy a human can change
Take away every day for love and respect
Let revenge be your faith until death

Turn my grief into art
Tore my haven apart

So why can't we fall for all what it's worth
What else can you do when you know that you're cursed
Truth is eternal but falsehood comes first
My haven is lost forever
So why won't we fall, can't stop my thirst
Ashes to ashes and dust turns to dirt
Reverse and rewind, cannot stop the tide
My haven is lost forever
My haven!

My haven!

Feel the pain of it all
As my haven will fall

So why won't we fall, can't stop my thirst
Ashes to ashes and dust turns to dirt
Reverse and rewind, cannot stop the tide
My haven is lost forever

So why can't we fall for all what it's worth
What else can you do when you know that you're cursed
Truth is eternal but falsehood comes first
My haven is lost forever
So why won't we fall, can't stop my thirst
Ashes to ashes and dust turns to dirt
Reverse and rewind, cannot stop the tide
My haven is lost forever
My haven!
