Lighted up, spotted out
All the barriers denied
Trade it in, fade the spot
Tracked it down
To the hidden believers
At the start nobody saw
You didn't care at all
Can't get it out of me

All the senses are numb
On the spot, paralysed
I get 99 problems but your hate ain't one
All the traitors, invaders
With bitter accusations
They wait for my fate
You can try but you can't break me down

I never said I can sit in silence (in silence)
You cannot blame me for never trying (never trying)
See the inferno rise!

I am not scared of the things you do
When you go down I go down with you
We can go crazy inside and then we deny
Inferno!
We cannot get everything we need
The inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me, it's all that I need
Inferno!

All the hate and the lies
And the problems that you find
And the fights you make up, make you feel
Just a little bit better
Don't need to see at all
Pride before the fall
Strengthen inside of me

If the curtain goes down
And I reach the divide
I got 99 reasons why I won't back down
I won't fake it, to make it
No force will ever shake it
I wait for my fate
Because what goes around, comes around

You never thought I would sit in silence (silence)
But you commend me for even trying (trying)
See the inferno rise!

I am not scared of the things you do
When you go down I go down with you
We can go crazy inside and then we deny
Inferno!
We cannot get everything we need
The inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me, it's all that I need
Inferno!

Begin to climb, I see the pinnacle
I can suddenly feel that I was in denial
As I transform into the mythical
From the ashes I see the inferno rise

I never said I can sit in silence (in silence)
You cannot blame me for never trying
See the inferno rise!

I am not scared of the things you do
(I am not scared)
When you go down I go down with you
(Go down with you)
We can go crazy inside and then we deny
Inferno!
(Inferno!)
We cannot get everything we need
The inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me, it's all that I need
Inferno!
