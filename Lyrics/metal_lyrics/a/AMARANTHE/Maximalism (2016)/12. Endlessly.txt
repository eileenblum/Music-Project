Now come, let me be your light
There's a truth we can't defy
Somehow this time you won't deny it
What got lost inside
I have found it now
There's a reason why

I will love you endlessly
And even if I cry
I'll be there by your side
For a lifetime
And I will love you endlessly
And even when we die
You'll be there by my side
Endlessly

So come, let me be your light
After all these sleepless nights
Somehow I know my strength will guide you
Through the darkest times
Now that I have found
All the reasons why

I will love you endlessly
And even if I cry
I'll be there by your side
For a lifetime
And I will love you endlessly
And even when we die
You'll be there by my side
Endlessly

You know you well
Somehow I'm under your spell
I want you to see me and share every moment with you

'Cause I...

I will love you endlessly
And even if I cry
I'll be there by your side
For a lifetime
And I will love you endlessly
And even when we die
You'll be there by my side
Endlessly
