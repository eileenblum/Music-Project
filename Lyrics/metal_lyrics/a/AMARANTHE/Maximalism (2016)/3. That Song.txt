It was a hard time
Living in the city
Broke my mind always trying hard to fit in
Somehow I tried to belong
But they were always telling me I was wrong
I was running around
I was chasing a dream
Behind the lights of a dirty limousine
But I had it inside I was coming along
And then it changed when you sang me that song

[Chorus:]
Oh sing me that song
I miss that sound sound
bringing me home.
Oh oh same old song
I left my soul soul living rock'n'roll.
Oh sing me that song
I miss the sound sound
Bringing me home.
Oh oh same old song
I left my soul soul living rock'n'roll

It was a rough time
Running out of money
Had a guitar and my jacket on my shoulder
Somehow I tried to be strong
But everyone just told me that I've tried for too long
When you come to the road
Where you have to decide
I tell you now to fight it and it will be alright
I got changed deep inside now I can't live without it
Yes I know you are right they are playing my song

[Chorus]

Everybody come along
We're together for one night
And together we belong
The best is yet to come
There's no reason why we can't keep
Singing that song

[Chorus]
