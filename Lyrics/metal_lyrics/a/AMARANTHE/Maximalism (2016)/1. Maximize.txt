Hello is there someone out there that can hear me scream
What you hear is not the same in a mystical dream
I know if you read between the lines it is serene
There's darkness in the shadows you can fear

Higher louder overdrive
Can you be the one to lift me higher
The future can be brighter
Someone be my guiding light
Maybe I can give what you require
Can't stop rewind so mesmerize

Mesmerize
Maximize me
Let's go beyond reality
If you can see what I see
Hypnotise maximize me
Let's take it to eternity
Believe the will inside of me

Come home to a life you never wanted to be real
I'm crawling deep within you in control
Bring me dignity to free this soul
Nothing ever lets me

Turn into the overdrive
Let me change my destiny forever
Let me swim against the tide
Maybe I will yearn for your desire
Maximize I'm mesmerized

Mesmerize
Maximize me
Let's go beyond reality
If you can see what I see
Hypnotise maximize me
Let's take it to eternity
Believe the will inside me

Higher louder overdrive
Can you be the one to lift me higher
The future can be brighter
Someone be my guiding light
Maybe I can give what you require
Can't stop rewind so mesmerize

Mesmerize
Maximize me
Let's go beyond reality
If you can see what I see
Hypnotise maximize me
Let's take it to eternity
Believe the will inside of me
