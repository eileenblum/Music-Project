When I repent
That I'm the cover of the magazine
And even thought I know it's all what I wanted
I wish to be, beheaded by a guillotine
Make me regret that I'm part of the scene

I am the man I am the man I am the madman
I ride the bullet of your everlasting fantasies
I can not take it take it can not take it anymore
Making me forget my dream

[Chorus.]
You can not run
You can not hide of fly away
Escape from yesterday
Try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

[Chorus repeat]

I'm disappointed
I can't get enough adrenaline
Like Yngwie said it
You unleashed the fucking fury
I'm crushing Slayer, Corey Taylor like a beat machine
Making you forget they're part of the scene

You wish you had a 9 to 5
Instead of copying me
You do your Soil-work
and yet you adore me
I said it in your face
I'm your Arch-enemy
Stop what you're doing and run

[Chorus]

Growl-god

I am you god, I am no saint
I need no Jake E
I am the posters on your wall. That's why I set you free
Who is Elize? I have no clue, cause all I see is me
Make me forget that I am a part of a team

I understand that you are hating my philosophy
The guys behind me ain't no band, they're slaving for me
I cannot fake it, fake it, cannot fake it anymore
The fury, the growl god I roar

[Chorus 2x]
