You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang like a boomerang round

One time did it two times
And now three times you call me baby
Why don't you let it all out you'll only drive me crazy
Let it go, I said no, no, no. I said no, no, no

I am sarcastic can you cope with my rejection
One time did it two times
It's now you reach your own reflection
Our go down down down

Why can't you leave me because
I am saying that I had it all
It's like you cannot see
It's just what I wanted
I can not take it
That you're thinking that you can know it all
Never going down like a boomerang round

You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang round like a boomerang round
Like a boomerang round like a boomerang round

I try to face it as you staging a defiance
I will re-route to remain you know that you are driving me insane
I said no, no, no let it go

I'm on the edge
It's like I am caged
I'm mass destruction
Eye for an eye
I see you now you face your destruction
Turn around you go down down down

Why can't you leave me because
I am saying that I had it all
It's like you cannot see
It's just what I wanted
I can not take it
That you're thinking that you can know it all
Never going down like a boomerang round

You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang round like a boomerang round
Like a boomerang round like a boomerang round

Think you're bloodhound
Then I am a mastermind
Think you're skybound you are going down down
If you're underground then I am a king crowned
Now you're going down like a boomerang round

Why can't you leave me because
I am saying that I had it all
It's like you cannot see
It's just what I wanted
I can not take it
That you're thinking that you can know it all
Never going down like a boomerang round

You can always bring me down but I come around
Like a boomerang round like a boomerang round
Like a boomerang round like a boomerang round
