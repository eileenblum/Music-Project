All this sorrow and broken bones
Bring it down to the core
Into this fragile moment
Just because it will burn
Now I Feel it coming the time is mine

In the shadows I hide
Leave no trace behind

Can I let it go
Erratic for the eye
A splinter in my soul
As you cross the line
Just a random pattern
To live another day
To start my insurrection
A dark charade

I'm a product
Of a bloody rage
In the end of it all
Undo this final moment
Just because it will burn

In the shadows I hide
Leave no trace behind

Can I let it go
Erratic for the eye
A splinter in my soul
As you cross the line
Just a random pattern
To live another day
To start my insurrection
A dark charade

Start my
insurrection

Domination
My creation
My subcontience clear
Through the eye of the needle
Run while you can

In the shadows I hide
Leave no trace behind

Can I let it go
Erratic for the eye
A splinter in my soul
As you cross the line
Just a random pattern
To live another day
To start my insurrection
A dark charade

Can I let it go
Erratic for the eye
A splinter in my soul
As you cross the line
Just a random pattern
To live another day
To start my insurrection
A dark charade
