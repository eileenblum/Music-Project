In my imagination
I feel my expectations rise
A passion that redefines life
I surrender to the light
Here's a feeling undefined
What I've waited for finally arrived

And I know that this is why
We can reach the sky
There's no limit in my mind.

Now this is my time
It is the breaking point
The end of the line
This is the reason for my strife
My Passion is larger than Life
You keep me alive
This is my breaking point
So show me the sign
Burns like a fire in my eyes
I'll make it with you by my side
By my side

With no hesitation
I stare right through
The devil's eyes
Today is the day I can die
Feels like growing hunger
but this is why I'm still alive
Now's the time put your weakness aside

My adrenalin your lust
Ash to ash and dust to dust
Raise it to eleven
And show the sign

Now this is my time
It is the breaking point
The end of the line
This is the reason for my strife
My Passion is larger than life
You keep me alive
This is my breaking point
So show me the sign
Burns like a fire in my eyes
I'll make it with you by my side

Remember all exceptional
Sense of fear
Never seamed to find the secret path
I'm so sincere
What ever happened to the fallen ones
To the fragile ones

And I feel that you and I
We can reach the sky
There's no limit in my mind.

Now this is my time
It is the breaking point
The end of the line
This is the reason for my strife
My Passion is larger than life
You keep me alive
This is my breaking point
So show me the sign
Burns like a fire in my eyes
I'll make it with you by my side
By my side
