Destiny comes to haunt me
I am the shell
Like an atom bomb
No fear, no lies
This is my sacrifice
I'm the one that destroys it all

I close my eyes
So cold inside
There's a voice, a warning sing
To stay alive
You sacrifice
The things you've put a side

This is who I am
This is what I fell
Every time I dream
A rain falls over me
This is how it feels
I'm starting to see
Can't you see it's all about me
This is who I am
This is what I feel
It's all about me

Mutiny has elected me
I'm all empty and weak
So take this life
And I will make it mine
As their secrets will bleed

I close my eyes
So cold inside
ThereÂ´s a shadow for behind
You can't deny
The world is falling down

This is who I am
This is what I fell
Every time I dream
A rain falls over me
This is how it feels
I'm starting to see
Can't you see it's all about me
This is who I am
This is what I feel
it's al about me
