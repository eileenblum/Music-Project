[Music: MÃ¶rck, Elize Lyrics: MÃ¶rck, Jake E, Elize, Andy]

It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
and it is never static

Don't let it go
I just want to explode
While this insanity eradicates my soul
I am your vision, it's the fire that I come true
Take it to the limit never look back
It's non erratic automatic

Please can you save me from myself?

It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
and it is never static
So lift me up and take me high
and make me everlasting
'Cause I am automatic

Your precious destiny
It's madness to behold
Oh it feels like I'm losing my control
I want the highway, stalk a loner in the cold
So don't let go!

Please can you save me from myself?

It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
and it is never static
So lift me up and take me high
and make me everlasting
'Cause I am automatic

Your angry vision
The power and control
Take it to the limit
Never look back
It's not neurotic
It's automatic!

[2x]
It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
and it is never static
So lift me up and take me high
and make me everlasting
'Cause I am automatic
