[Music: MÃ¶rck, Elize Lyrics: MÃ¶rck]

A bitter revelation
Is a product of ambition
No matter what you say
I'm a stranger to submission

But what I see before me
Is a element of passion
In my recognition
Is the fallout of compassion

Taken life for granted
Never struggle just to find
Illusions being planted
Deep inside of my mind

IT'S A INVITATION
TO THE CORNER OF MY MIND
ACT OF DESPERATION
TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND
HERE'S OUR DESTINATION
SO COME ON STEP INSIDE
TAKE MY HAND AND YOU WILL
DISCOVER WHAT I HIDE

Deciphering enigmas
Is a part of who you are
Identify the secrets of the eagle and the compass star

So let it be proclaimed that I'm a slave to revelation
Show me your compassion
Be a part of our creation

One dark obsession
Irreversible denials
I read about one's guidance
Once together, never

IT'S A INVITATION
TO THE CORNER OF MY MIND
ACT OF DESPERATION
TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND
HERE'S OUR DESTINATION
SO COME ON STEP INSIDE
TAKE MY HAND AND YOU WILL

IT'S A INVITATION
TO THE CORNER OF MY MIND
ACT OF DESPERATION
TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND
HERE'S OUR DESTINATION
SO COME ON STEP INSIDE
TAKE MY HAND AND YOU WILL
DISCOVER WHAT I HIDE
