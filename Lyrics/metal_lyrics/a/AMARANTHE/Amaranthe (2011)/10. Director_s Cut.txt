[Music: MÃ¶rck, Jake E Lyrics: Jake E, MÃ¶rck]

Illusions conducted my life
Blurred and ailed eyes
The curtain darken the broken mirror
I no longer fear them
As I'm losing the grip of it all
Just a fragment of what used to be

One world, illusion's contradiction
We blindfold our own eyes
And believe their velvet lies

This is a step towards tomorrow
The truth of what we will become
A director's cut, never seen the daylight
An initiated Armageddon
A covert deceiving begun
So close to define
What you have to sacrifice

Abandoned a life in recluse
Predestined before
My shadow was not even born
I see things clearer
So these are my options
Both will end up in torment and pain
Just a fragment of what you will see

Their words will feed our own addiction
To blindfold our own eyes
You'll reveal their velvet lies

This is a step towards tomorrow
The truth of what we will become
A director's cut, never seen the daylight
An initiated Armageddon
A covert deceiving begun
So close to define
What you have

This is a step towards tomorrow
A director's cut, never seen the daylight
An initiated Armageddon
So close to define
What you have to sacrifice

I'm in chase of a purpose
At the same time I'm struggling to find
Your end draws nearer
I'm embraced by the circle
An escape without further design
Just a fragment, what's destined to be

One world, illusion's contradiction
We blindfold our own eyes
And believe their velvet lies

This is a step towards tomorrow
The truth of what we will become
A director's cut, never seen the daylight
An initiated Armageddon
A covert deceiving begun
So close to define
What you have to sacrifice

This is a step towards tomorrow
The truth of what we will become
A director's cut, never seen the daylight
An initiated Armageddon
A covert deceiving begun
So close to define
What you have to sacrifice
