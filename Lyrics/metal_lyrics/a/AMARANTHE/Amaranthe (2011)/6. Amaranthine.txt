[Lyrics: MÃ¶rck, Jake E Lyrics: MÃ¶rck, Andy]

Time
Is the reason why we fight to stay alive
Until the morning comes

It's a strife
But the shimmer in your eyes just makes me know
That you and I belong

And you can light the dark all by your own
So let us show the world our love is strong

LIKE A SIGN
LIKE A DREAM
YOU'RE MY AMARANTHINE
YOU ARE ALL I NEEDED, BELIEVE ME
LIKE WE DRIFT IN A STREAM
YOUR BEAUTY SERENE
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
IN LIFE I EVER NEED
MY DREAM, AMARANTHINE

Time
Goes by as day and nights are turning into years
But I'm lying in your arms
It's the place
Where I know that I am closest to your heart
Where the dark is torn apart.

I know you feel the same as I inside
It feels like in a dream where we can fly

LIKE A SIGN
LIKE A DREAM
YOU'RE MY AMARANTHINE
YOU ARE ALL I NEEDED, BELIEVE ME
LIKE WE DRIFT IN A STREAM
YOUR BEAUTY SERENE
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
IN LIFE I EVER NEED
MY DREAM, AMARANTHINE

It's a strife
But the shimmer in your eyes just makes me know
You're my amaranthine 

LIKE A SIGN
LIKE A DREAM
YOU'RE MY AMARANTHINE
YOU ARE ALL I NEEDED, BELIEVE ME

LIKE A SIGN
LIKE A DREAM
YOU'RE MY AMARANTHINE
YOU ARE ALL I NEEDED, BELIEVE ME
LIKE WE DRIFT IN A STREAM
YOUR BEAUTY SERENE
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
IN LIFE I EVER NEED
MY DREAM, AMARANTHINE
