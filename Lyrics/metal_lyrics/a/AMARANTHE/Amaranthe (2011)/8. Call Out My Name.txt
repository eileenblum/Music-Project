[Music: MÃ¶rck, Jake E Lyrics: Jake E, MÃ¶rck]

Our time has come
Rise and see what you have become
Old lessons learned
Determined to reap what they've earned

No, I'm not the same
Seen my own shadow and gone through the shame
But this is the price
I'll let all my demons awake

When they call out my name

SEE, IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
COME ON HEAR MY WHISPER
AND CALL OUT MY NAME
AND I'LL SEE INTO THE INSANITY
I WILL NEVER SAY THIS IS FATE
WHENEVER YOU NEED ME
JUST CALL OUT MY NAME
AND I'LL BE THERE WITH YOUR INSANITY

It has begun
Wake and see your freedoms undone
Let reasons mourn
Escape from a life overturned

I am going insane
Enraptured by secrets revealed by my pain
But what is the price
To let all my demons awake
When all senses prevail

SEE, IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
COME ON HEAR MY WHISPER
AND CALL OUT MY NAME
AND I'LL SEE INTO THE INSANITY
I WILL NEVER SAY THIS IS FATE
WHENEVER YOU NEED ME
JUST CALL OUT MY NAME
AND I'LL BE THERE WITH YOUR INSANITY

SO CALL OUT MY NAME

No longer turn when they're around
I've put my feet back on the ground
Have no intentions to return

That's why I burn
My lesson learned

SEE, IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
COME ON HEAR MY WHISPER
AND CALL OUT MY NAME
AND I'LL SEE INTO THE INSANITY

SEE, IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
COME ON HEAR MY WHISPER
AND CALL OUT MY NAME
AND I'LL SEE INTO THE INSANITY
I WILL NEVER SAY THIS IS FATE
WHENEVER YOU NEED ME
JUST CALL OUT MY NAME
AND I'LL BE THERE WITH YOUR INSANITY

SO CALL OUT MY NAME
