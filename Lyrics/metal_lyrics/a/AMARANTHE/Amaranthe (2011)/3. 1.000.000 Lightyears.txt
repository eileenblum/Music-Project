[Music: MÃ¶rck, Elize Lyrics: MÃ¶rck, Elize, Jake E, Andy]

Stop and let my mind reflect and capture my emotions
Run towards the end just to appraise your own devotion
Steal, adrenaline is what I need to keep on moving
Fight to let them now that I'll do anything to prove it

You run, you steal and won't give up a fight
Stop me, your illusion might reflect your past
and now you want it back

I RUN THROUGH TIME AND SPACE
SEE THE WORLD FROM AFAR
WHERE MY JOURNEY TURNS INTO A RACE
I WILL ROAM THE EARTH
AND I'LL CONQUER THE STARS
IF YOU HAVE ONE THOUSAND REASONS TO STAY
THEN I'LL BE ONE MILLION LIGHTYEARS AWAY

Fall into a void and rumble round among deception
Hide behind the curtain to deny these accusations
Stay just so the world could see you leave in desperation
Fly towards the sun this is the countdown to extinction

You fall, you hide, afraid to lose your life.
You stay, but just so you could fly astray
A million miles away

I RUN THROUGH TIME AND SPACE
SEE THE WORLD FROM AFAR
WHERE MY JOURNEY TURNS INTO A RACE
I WILL ROAM THE EARTH
AND I'LL CONQUER THE STARS
IF YOU HAVE ONE THOUSAND REASONS TO STAY
THEN I'LL BE ONE MILLION LIGHTYEARS AWAY

Can't stay a lie perfected, it's so bizarre
You stay and pray for wonders
To deny it all

I RUN THROUGH TIME AND SPACE
SEE THE WORLD FROM AFAR
WHERE MY JOURNEY TURNS INTO A RACE
I WILL ROAM THE EARTH
AND I'LL CONQUER THE STARS
IF YOU HAVE ONE THOUSAND REASONS TO STAY
THEN I'LL BE ONE MILLION LIGHTYEARS AWAY
