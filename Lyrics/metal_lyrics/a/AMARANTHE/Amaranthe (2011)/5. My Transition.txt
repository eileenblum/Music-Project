[Music: MÃ¶rck Lyrics: MÃ¶rck, Andy]

How long's the path to restoration
One step towards our final salvation
Don't dare to see that I'm a part of their illusion
A world in fear and one infected evolution

Just like you saw it in your vision
Now you're a piece of the whole
We'll bring an end to this treason someday
Now you sold your soul

CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU ALWAYS WILL BE THERE
WHEN I'M OUT OF CONTROL
WILL YOU SEE HOW MY FRUSTRATION WILL GROW
THAT I WON'T LET YOU GO

Inside lies a fatal innovation
Undo their terminal creation
Chaos procreates a valuable distraction
Failure will create a lethal reaction

It's like you've started a transition
Into a piece of the whole
We'll bring an end to this treason someday
As it all unfolds

CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU ALWAYS WILL BE THERE
WHEN I'M OUT OF CONTROL
WILL YOU SEE HOW MY FRUSTRATION WILL GROW
THAT I WON'T LET YOU GO

Is this a reason to hope or just fire in our eyes
One world in fear, infected evolution
Can we break free from these secrets we're holding inside?

Just like you saw it in your vision
Now you're a piece of the whole
I'll bring an end to this treason someday
Now you sold your soul

CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU ALWAYS WILL BE THERE
WHEN I'M OUT OF CONTROL
WILL YOU SEE HOW MY FRUSTRATION WILL GROW
THAT I WON'T LET YOU GO
