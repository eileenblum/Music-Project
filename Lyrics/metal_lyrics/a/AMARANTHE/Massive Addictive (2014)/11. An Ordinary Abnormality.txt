Can't save a life that burns
Entwine a million souls to fight
As we change gear to overdrive
We raise our voices in fear - Unite
Until the threats declined - Delivered
It's an alliance intertwined

Define sensational, The actions of a lie
It's like a mirror, Crushed in thousand pieces

We're so irrational, Your rules do not apply
Confirm your clarity And face a forced divinity

Subjective mental disdain - Regain
Retain the clutch of the pain - Denial
I'm underestimated

Oh why
Won't you believe
Accuse me and strip me of my liberty
Hey look here, follow me
It's an ordinary abnormality

Survived a miracle
Dramatically revived
We pull the trigger
Burst into thousand pieces

We're so adaptable
That we could change disguise
Confirm your clarity
And face a forced divinity

The bells will sing as you cry - You die
Unleash your bestial pride - Forever
It's a defiance of a lie

Restrain the light that burns
Endure the darkest side of fame
We overload and override
Selective central complain - Obtain
Regain the force of rain - Deliver
I'm underestimated
