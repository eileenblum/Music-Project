[Spoken words:]
Resistance is futile

[Verse 1:]
Like the sun comes crashing down
You will set the world on fire
DEEP DOWN, YOU GOT TO KNOW WHY
WE PREPARE FOR WAR
ITâS VENGEANCE OR SACRIFICE

[Verse 2:]
Incapability to hide
From the predictable desire
TIMEâS UP, ALL IN
I WILL RISE TO THE TOP

[Pre-refrain:]
Going to crush us, put us to sleep, itâs lifting us up
As our instincts come alive
Got to never give in as weâre falling into the sky
THIS TIME GONNA LET US ALL SHINE
(ONE MAKES THREE IN THIS CHEMISTRY)

[Refrain:]
Trinity is the key to feel alive
Itâs just a shattered world; there right before your eyes
BEFORE YOUR EYES
You see the will to fight, as we live and die
I see the light; itâs trinity
TRINITY, unite

[Verse 3:]
As I set the sky alight
An inescapable empire
HEADâS UP, YOU GOT TO REALIZE
THAT GLOW YOU SEE
FOREVER WILL HAUNT US

As we break the chains of might
In dependence of the fire
GIVE UP, THIS GROUND STERILIZED FOR ALL TIME
