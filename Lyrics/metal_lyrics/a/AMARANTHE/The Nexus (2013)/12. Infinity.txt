How would it end
If the truth was rewritable
Break with the past
Whatever dreams you long for
I've seen what the future has in mind for me

Throwing the spear into the heart of the void
Counting the odds like I am out of control
It's like a fight against the gravity

Breaking the codes
Like a mission impossible
Letters that fall
I'm only partly mechanical
My strength is my weakness
Please unfasten me

Infinity, for a moment in time
Will memories be revived
I turn the page in the chapters of life
Infinity keeps me alive

Stuck in a wheel
I'm alive it's a miracle
What should I do about the pain is this critical
You know that the future looks the same for me

Watching my life
Leaving everything inside of me
While the sun
Devours our history
This time there's no turning back, I leave it be

Infinity, for a moment in time
Will memories be revived
I turn the page in the chapters of life
Infinity keeps me alive

Infinity, for a moment in time
Will memories be revived
I turn the page in the chapters of life
Eternity walks by my side
As infinity keeps me alive
