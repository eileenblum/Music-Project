A vivid yet sensless perfection
Reflects in these cynical times
It seems like the future was calling
Something brought me to life

As I pick up the pieces
Yet I'm still unaware
That my nemesis
Is my own belief
And my actions will change why I'm here

'Cause I won't give it up
I have seen enough
And I will never stop
A Universe where stardust leads the way
Help, I died just to make you see
Stardust won't you take me
To galaxies where all hope's astray

I shake by the septic infection
A rush as it runs down my spine
It feels like I'm crossing the border
My hunger comes alive

As I pass through the mirror
It's a travel through time
There's no turning back
On a one way track
My addiction which renders me blind

'Cause I won't give it up
I have seen enough
And I will never stop
A Universe where stardust leads the way
Help, I died just to make you see
Stardust won't you take me
To galaxies where all hope's astray

An image of godless ideals
Is what reflects in these eyes
Seems like the heavens are falling
It's the truth of my demise

'Cause I won't give it up
I have seen enough
And I will never stop
A Universe where stardust leads the way
Help, I died just to make you see
Stardust won't you take me
To galaxies where all hope's astray

Stardust leads the way
