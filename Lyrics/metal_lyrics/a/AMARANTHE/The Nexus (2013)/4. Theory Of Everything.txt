Hope we lost
Along the way as we go far
Into a world that's grown too dark
Forced and cruel emotionless electro-hearts
Build greed and mechanical wars

Can no one save us from this lifeless shame
Tell me how to focus on what's left behind
Now it's our time to heal the pain

Let this earth renew
We will see it through
It's my theory of everything
We will wars undo
Make the oceans blue
Paint the heavens with stars
And I won't let it out of my heart
No we won't let this world fall apart

To a bleak synthetic species we have grown
We're heading into the unknown
Tell me why dystopia has filled our hearts
With grief and unmendable scars

Can no one save us from this lifeless shame
Will we rise from this nightmare on our own
How can we take away the stains

Let this earth renew
We will see it through
It's my theory of everything
We will wars undo
Make the oceans blue
Paint the heavens with stars
And I won't let it out of my heart
No we won't let this world fall apart

Break down, Deny, My destiny
I came across what should be left alone
The will to die, infesting me
I am the product of insanity

Let this earth renew
We will see it through
It's my theory of everything
We will wars undo
Make the oceans blue
Paint the heavens with stars
And I won't let it out of my heart

Let it out of my heart

Let this earth renew
We will see it through
It's my theory of everything
We will wars undo
Make the oceans blue
Paint the heavens with stars
And I won't let it out of my heart
No we won't let this world fall apart
