Break me free
There is no return
It's the start of my rebirth
But as I glow just like a firefly
Time creates a vortex ride

Let it out
Of my sanity
It's a source of my serenity
I'm half the man I used to be
I still resent its sanity

Walking in circles
As I open my eyes
It's like I never stop and then wake up

So wake me up to an everlasting afterlife
It is designed from the secrets I hide
So set me free
And this time you'll be electrified
The future leaves nothing behind
It's my afterlife

Hear my scream
I brake the seal
An impulse of me revived
And as I fill my lungs
It's hard to breath
Like I was born inside a dream

Welcome home
You are not alone
And no longer on your own
I'm half the man I used to be
A second life infesting me

Walking in circles
As I open my eyes
It's like I never stop and then wake up

So wake me up to an everlasting afterlife
It is designed from the secrets I hide
So set me free
And this time you'll be electrified
The future leaves nothing behind
It's my afterlife

As I wake up
They're dissecting me
Can't see can't breath in this reality
Synthetic christ machine
I'm forced to live with abnormality

So wake me up to an everlasting afterlife
It is designed from the secrets I hide
So set me free
And this time you'll be electrified
The future leaves nothing behind
It's my afterlife
