You know!
You hear those cries of anguish each time
That you face the mirror
And those deafening voices blames me
But that's more than I'm trying to hear
So let the pain revive you
Never let me get inside you
Never...again.
Let's just oppress this demon within
The abyss is a friend
You breathe deceit
And I'm surprised I still stand on my feet
You know that I live
I breathe hate
Our days were agony
And therefore so tragically
There was satisfaction
Hate fucking in apathy
So fucking tell me
Were there days when things were so much better?
Before you were such a self loathing hateful bitch.
Recognize the hell that you're spewing forth
What we might have shared is nothing anymore
What you said to me
Was never meant to be
Never.... again....
