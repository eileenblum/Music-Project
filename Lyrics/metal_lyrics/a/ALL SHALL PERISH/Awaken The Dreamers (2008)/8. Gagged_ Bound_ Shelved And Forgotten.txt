Denied
A whisper
A voice to try to fill the chambers
Destroyed by lies
Feels were faking
Our power is draining
Out of our hands

Don't let them take out nation [x4]
Leaving us drifting through false hope

Redemption has come
They tell us that we're fine
That we choose our rights
Our choice is a fight
What fucking lies
They slay our minds

This is for penance
This is for silence
Blunt force reminds us
We all are taking the fall
And if they thing they've won
They better think
They fucking better think twice

We've degraded to violence
We own, More than you'll ever know
We own, The streets and your fucking home
Us, not them
I'm tired, waiting for help
For an answer
For some savior
They have no hope left to sell

So don't let them take our nation [x4]

Today lets rise to reach
For that tomorrow
That lives inside you and me
I would die
Fighting for that day

Today lets rise to reach
For that tomorrow
That lives inside you and me
I would die for our day
