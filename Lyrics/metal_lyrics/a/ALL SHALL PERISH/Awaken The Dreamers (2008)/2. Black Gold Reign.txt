Will they see?
Will they hear?
Will they see this?
Will they feel this?
Will they hear the voice of resistance or will they bring us down for their bloodshed?
Trade us all 'til black gold rains
Fought this fight, there's no end in sight except for our rights
Will they blind us all?
"Be all that you can be"
Forever in vain, our wasted beliefs
Erase the truth
So with that fall from grace will they burn it all down in emphatic
Fading away
Fading away
To this time
To when we began
Forever from cleansing the blood from our hands
Release the truth
Destroyed in anguish, another million faceless
And I wish we had eyes to view our demise
Tomorrow, together we rise
With their fallen disguise we must hunt the despised
Thieves; high class murderers
They can't taste this anger that flows through our veins
A separation of our own god damned nation that lets us die
Leaders that follow a golden tomorrow
They bleed us dry
We let them rise
