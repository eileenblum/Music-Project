Change sets in my life to start the plague
Fright becomes my resort to find
All the hate I need inside
Your take our words that bind us
Destroyed Our
Time to heal this Mess
I..... Won't return to you
I..... Have found myself anew
I..... Won't return to you
Our face the arrogance
Eviscerated the love I thought we had
I won't make it back these words are
Stronger
Than the promise you forgot we had.
I...Can't...Forgive....You!!
I have seen this through
I.... Have found myself anew
I.... won't return to you.
