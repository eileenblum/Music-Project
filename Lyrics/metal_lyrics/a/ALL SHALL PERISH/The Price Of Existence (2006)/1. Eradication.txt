Leading the tables turn
As we fail not to create
A false Sense of Edradication
To revel in, separation
I detest this life
Inching but seeming to end this life
Surprising your neurons its all with time
That meaning will creep inside
Much soon you will find,
You'll find you're closer, closer to the fucking
Fight
Closer to the fucking...........
Fire it's depleting but the spark will soon
Rekingdle all that truly recedes
I have no place to show you it will come trust
Me
You soon shall see
I wish that our lives weren't
The facade they seem to be
Some how the purpose was just lost for me
Left to your discretion
You decide.... Your only way
Don't let me  the oppression
Manipulate your only way
Leading the times have turned to show the
Mass decay of your will to fight
In separation only to see Eradication
