I have made a lasting picture among
The faces
The night hath plagued
Lost it all lie that your fathers
Have fought for am I the defiant
One
Along a saving grace
Neglected left to the dogs
Betrayed they've fed me to the fires
Places in fields where near sounds
Of terror
Fill our Ears; Vacant sounds
Consuming all around
Faces lost in the night swallowed
Amongst the decay
Lost in a time when we still felt
Alive the illusions has made us its
Slave
Taken by the fear of Desolation
I stay awake throughout sounds of despair up holding my attention
Why has it all come to this?
This life has not finished. Help me
A simple man without needs
I have not lost my will to breathe
This can not betray the good in me
I'm not paying for your beliefs
Pain is enough
