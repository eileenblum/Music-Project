Make your last requests, and begin to
Slowly slip away. I've forgotten all
Your desperations. This endeavor makes
Further decay
I know we have all known for so long
Of the truth
We've lived under capitals rule
...Know - All of their progress is
Laced with the dead
They will never have the power
We've always had
Now don't fucking forget
They have killed with no questions
Again
Always tried to demand our respect?
With every life
Taken for lies
Your demise fills our eyes
You....
Cant escape all of this tragedy
Face all the truths of our destiny
They've abandoned our needs.
We won't die for your greed and we're
Here to bring you, to bring you to your
Knees
To your fuckin' knees
Force you to your knees
Make your last requests, and begin to
Slowly slip away
I've forgotten all your desperations
I will prove that your god can not save
I know, we have all known, for so long
Of the truth
We died for their profits like fools
Know...All of their progress is laced
With the dead,
And they will never have the power
We've always had
Never fucking forget.
