Fuck every thing
You ever told me
You were the one, I trusted in
I was so blind
Cut out my own eyes for fear the sight
These broken pieces of a life I tried to hide
I tried to hide
In this is all I find..
(all I find)
I'm... Gone....Forsaken.
(I'm... Gone....Forsaken.)
Inside a sullen Tomb
(Sullen Tomb)
Retrace My life
(retrace my life)
And slowly you will understand
(this reckoning)
This reckoning is regaining power
(Power)
Living
Through Catastrophe
A horrid lapse of senses
We feed
A mouth that should not eat
We've gone too far Replenished on the weak
I can't decide if we have leaped
Or if we are falling you'll choke on your Lies
Its time to regain my pride
Rest assured I make a place
Cleansed free of your torment
Turn away again this pain
Shall remain forgotten
I wish I wish that some day you will be the
One the one to be withered and dying alone
I wish that some day you will be the one.
