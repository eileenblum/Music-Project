I have seen what it means
To detest and to care
And to outlive the dream of you and me
This has been a disease overtaking a new
Sense of being
Pain staring from your eyes
Have we made a promise?
Strained too far this lie
The trust has been broken again
And this path will never lead
Past the nightmare straight
Towards my grace.
Not another fucking forfeit....Forget.
Rising hate left to fear
I won't be buried in here...No
Buried in here
Now crawl into the shadows
Your power betrayed lied and wept
A self destructive ocean.
Displaced this torment
And it's dyin' for destruction
It will devour our pain; just let it
Release this agony.
We can't control it
Somethings were......Meant to be.
Some things were meant to be just....
Torturous Pain.
