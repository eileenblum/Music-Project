Scathing attacks of time and torment
When we sleep walk our lives away
These thieves
They've made
Our hearts break
So now I'm screaming
Attacks of heartless horror
At them their cash can't kill us all and
We have built we have, we have built upon their
Dream too long
Don't be their fucking slaves
We live in exploitation we have worked blind
Endless means
They have turned our failure into what they
Need
So break these shackles and take a stand we are the gears
We are the ones they fear
Take their crowns away
They won't take away my life, a slave no longer
In my mind I
Break these shackles and take a stand to tell
The world
The revolt returns
Break these shackles and take a stand to tell
The world
Get up
We live in exploitation we have worked blind
Endless means they have turned our failure into what they
Need
Take it back.
