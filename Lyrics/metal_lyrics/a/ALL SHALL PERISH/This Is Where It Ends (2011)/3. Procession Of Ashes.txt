Give me your attention please. This isn't a drill. They're 
shooting to kill. Still I'm here breathing. Come with me now.

Together we can start the fire. Burning the whole world to 
ash.  This place is set for ruination. Let's help it fall apart.

Striking the match as you set the world aflame. Watch it as 
it burns away.  We all want to end it, but we're too afraid.  
Let me pave the way.

Burn it all down [5x]

Why should we care?  We were all forsaken anyway.
I've seen the despair.  I cannot take it.

Burn it all down [8x]

We are disgusted with all the corruption and all the 
misleading depraved.
All you who use us, we'll render you useless and watch as 
your life blows away.
