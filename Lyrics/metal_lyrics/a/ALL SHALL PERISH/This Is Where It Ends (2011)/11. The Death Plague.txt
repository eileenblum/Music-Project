Cold chill running up into the cortex
My eyes turn black with the hinder for flesh
I wander around broken and aimless smelling of death
A lifeless cadaver needing nourishment

We sooth to no end a hunger that will not subside
The animalistic impulse that keeps us alive

The sounds of prey fighting for life bring me to find the soon to be pile of rotting stench
Satisfaction has temporarily come over me and once its gone I move on towards another feed

We are the foul infestation
We are resilient
Soon as I bite my children live on, living as death incarnate
We where conceived as a plague
A cataclysmic device

You will tremble in agoraphobic fear for the outside will become a place unwelcome to your kind

We are the dominant species

You do not have a choice
I'll come from the shadows to tear you apart

We are the dominant spices

You do not have a choice
You will become a feast, toss the scraps to the dogs

We are the dominant species

Species

We are the foul infestation
We are the resilient
Soon as I bite my children live on, living as death incarnate
Cataclysmic device

With every passing moment my kind grows strong
We only serve our primal instinct
We've set our eyes upon you

We are the dominant species
We are the dominant species
