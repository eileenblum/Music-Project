You fucking disgust me

My hatred for you grows with every breath you take
You only exist to lie, those eyes are treacherous
It's like a ball inside, the rage I hide
With a smile on my face

This demon will not subside
I live to make you suffer, to show you how rotten true love can be
In our fate lies an institution
A prison of the mind this life sentence is your disease

I've seen you distrust and manipulate those who love you

I am your only choice in this life of pain
I am your only choice in this life of pain

I knew it all along
You'd cross me
This should have been cut off and left to fade away
For you I gave
But still I crave
To see your broken heart you fucking wretched waste

This demon will not subside
I'll trap you in this room
Where no one will ever hear your screams
In this place lies my restitution
A burdened heart no more
You've lost all power over me

[Solo - Francesco]

I am your only choice in this life of pain
(You fucking disgust me)
I am your only choice in this life of pain

We have only suffered
So why do we have to see ourselves in perfect pictures
Perfection will never exist as long as we breathe
