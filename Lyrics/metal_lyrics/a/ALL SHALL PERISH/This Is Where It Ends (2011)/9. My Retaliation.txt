I hope to see you fucking die

To watch as you scour around for someone to save you
You'll beg for mercy
On deaf ears your cries will fall
You worthless coward
I am the one sending you to hell

Sat through your bullshit stories, of all that we would become
I thought you had the best intentions but you looked out for number one

Time has shown that all your distractions were merely a hoax Your tricks are amateur at best
Your pockets get thicker with each puff of smoke.
Take your ass back to school
Manipulation of all those who followed shows us that you have no control
Shows us that you have no control

It does not take a genius to understand all that you're about.
The erratic displacement of all of your benefit. What a
miserable fucking joke.

We all danced for your enjoyment, now the music is over and the shoes are on you
Let me show you step one, take your fucking head right out of your ass
Learn your place within the pack and you can share in the feast as well
You continue to work against yourself
There's no pity left for you

The truth is the world is full of people like you
It's not just here within our walls that someone
Can sway so heavily the way things work

You're going down
My fists are clenched tight
Ready to strike against you
I embody the vengeance
Of all who stand against you

My fists are clenched right
Ready to strike against you
I embody the vengeance
Of all who stand against you

I hope to see you fucking die
I hope to see you fucking die
I hope to see you fucking die
