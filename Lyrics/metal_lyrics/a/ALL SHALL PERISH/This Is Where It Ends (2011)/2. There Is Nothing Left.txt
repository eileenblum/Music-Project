I can't hear another word
The world is screaming out for me
I am no hero
Just let me sleep to end the day
I can't keep living this way

Reset the watch and start again, without the hardest parts
I'm so fed up with the complaints
Pouring salt on the deepest of cuts
The worst has come and gone
What else is left to fall on me

I will never feel sorry for you
I am your hero
Pick up your head and join with me
Leave that bed and deal with the shit

Reset the watch and start again
Remember the hardest parts
I'm so fed up with your complaints
Suicidal and tormented
The worst has come and gone
Use me to stand
On your feet again

You could just end it all to never feel again
Are you needing my approval?
That's something that you will never get
So leave those useless self-loathing thoughts
You heart is meant to deal, with the pain

You could just end it all
Such an attention whore
To never feel again
Weakened and inept
Are you needing my approval?
That's something you will never get
