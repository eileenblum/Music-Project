We had the chance and we blew it
We took it all for granted and now it slips away
They lied as we cried and did nothing for it
Soon the shackles won't be idealistic

Forget your percet life
The times will change
We are what's wrong
Our doom awaits

A change of events will soon unfold to show that our society lacks strength
We can't stand by as forces build and our lives turn to shit
They built our government to give us a sense of bliss
They in turn sell us our own death warrants

We are the masses. We cannot be weak
Free will is just an image don't buy into their greed
Government has run wild, the proof is plain to see
They preach sophistication while they rape, lie, and cheat

The innocent shall bleed
Our own ignorance and apathy have paved our way
I have seen where this path leads
So much has gone wrong as we sit and laugh our lives away
We have become the butt of all their jokes
They'll laugh last you'll see

We had to chance and we blew it
We took it all for granted and now it slips away
They lied as we cried and did nothing for it
Soon the shackles won't be idealistic

We are the masses, We cannot be weak
Free will is just an image don't buy into their greed
Government has run wild, the proof is plain to see
They preach sophistication while they rape, lie, and cheat
