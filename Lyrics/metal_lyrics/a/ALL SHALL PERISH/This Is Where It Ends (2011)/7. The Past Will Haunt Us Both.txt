In this empty room sits a familiar fragrance
Seemingly endless nights with my feet to the sky
So many lonesome questions
If we had only tried, how could we let this all dissolve?

How could we be so wrong?
This past will haunt us both

Never know what hate could be all too fulfilling
That betrayal was the key to a happier life
Where did we lose compassion?
At what point did we even fail to try?

I left you all alone
This past will haunt us both

Our souls will haunt us both
And we where stripped of worth

I'm laying my head down on this abandoned surface
Trying to solve the mystery of our plight
Waking up to rumors of your surroundings
Falling into these sleepless nights

How could we be so wrong?
Our souls will haunt us both
I left you all alone
This past will haunt us both

I said "Leave me alone in this hell"
I had never given into anyone until I met you

You gave me a reason to reason with this fucked up life
So how am I supposed to keep on in this fight?

How could we be so wrong?
Our souls will haunt us both

We shouldn't dwell upon the ending of it all
It will go on and on, on and on
This is the final song
We can't keep dancing all night long
