Face your family and place your face on the ground
We are here to make sure you are not one of them

We all are the same
We judge them for their subtle differences
Spewing false accusations
To excuse our inhuman behavior

Watch as your children cry, as we rip your home apart
This is what we call warfare
This is what we call warfare

We think the worst has passed
Humanity is lost

A man told me his name
As he cried and plead for forgiveness
He was never to blame
He bleeds for this horrendous system

We all must die

Who the fuck do we think we are?

We cannot police this planet
This is what we call warfare

Sent the brave to humiliate our nation
Our self serving debt to the world is insatiable

We think the worst has passed
Humanity is lost
Humanity is lost
