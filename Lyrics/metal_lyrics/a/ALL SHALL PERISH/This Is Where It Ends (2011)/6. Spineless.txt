You look for ways to get out to blame others for things you've done wrong
You point your fucking fingers, in the shape of a gun at the first to stand tall
When did you lose your power?
When did idleness take control?
Just take your drug and go to sleep

Numbing your sense of action
Numbing the feel of sinking in

We have begun to sniff you out of the shadows you live in
The scent of fear is pungent now
It's making me sick

And so it goes on, this unbalanced human life
Afraid to take any chances
Afraid to stand up and fight

Just take your drug and go to sleep
Numbing your sense of action
Just take your drug and go to sleep
Numbing the sense of sinking in, it's sinking in

Wake up, your life has become nothing
The time to dream has gone and passed away

It's time to take action, to stop living in your regret
The door is right in front of you, stand up and take the step

Get up

It's time to take action, to stop living your regret
The door is right in front of you, stand up and take the step
