You must fear your maker or else you'll plummet down.
For your salvation blindly follow them into his words.
We'll purify you.  You'll suffer no pain within his hands.
Just bow your head, show your lament, and soon you'll understand.

We are the stations we are the strict foundation.
We make them follow as you serve a life negotiated.
And you will fall if our rules will not be followed.
We'll turn our backs and disregard this message we've been given.

At what point did you begin to believe that all your pain disappears with just
a prayer.
That your salvation was something handed out as easy as the pamphlets you
receive.

We are no different, we could be self sufficient.
This life could simply be the answer to all of our questions.
And you will fall if your heart you will not follow.
There is no hope for anyone that takes the pill they're given.

In the end you will see they were wrong.
You will cease to be, with no one around.
No deity will wash away the pain of existence.
In the end you will see they were wrong.
You will cease to be, with no one around.
Your god can't save you.
Your god can't save you.

No one knows what is at the end.
If there is an end. This is the only truth you will ever expose....

Your god can't save you.
Your god can't save you.
Your god can't save you.
Your god can't save you.
