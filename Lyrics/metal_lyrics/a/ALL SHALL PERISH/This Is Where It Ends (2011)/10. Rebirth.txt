Rebirth of a lost way of life
A mentality quickly abandoned
This dominion will rise up from ruin
But not without a grotesque demise

Do not forget what life is meant to symbolize
The true test of one's personal stature
The strength of will has arrived to direct us
This pitiful erroneous understanding has left us
Left us depraved

Who has sent this place into perdition?

What scapegoat can we create?
Only to ourselves can we truly lie
No one cares about your decisions
The affected move on without you
Face the emptiness you create

You create
You create

We are the only ones to blame for this disaster
The few make an effort while the rest rot away
Crown yourselves the kinds and queens of lethargy
Within you lies the momentum of change

Dissolving this distasteful life we lead
While we all drift away
We came searching for someone to blame
We hurt the ones we care the most

This place of solitude will bring out the deepest secrets we all push down
Mass reckoning will leave us all out in the cold
Hoard of derelict vermin

We will be begging for absolution
Dissolving this fucked up life we lead

Let the sounds of disaster take you away
Let the waves of redemption crash down on you
