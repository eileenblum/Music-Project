It's an accustomed response for man to fear the wolf's call
For the wolf has hunted man for generations
We must revive this fear and strike it in their hearts
For benevolence means the collapse of reason

The art of deception is their most defining trait
Do not treat them as equals as they are the ones who
decide our fate
Man is all destructive, callous and based on greed
We take the nature of the wolf, show them our strength
Show them our teeth

I burn this mark into your chest
A symbol we forever fight in grotesque

When they cower they will scream for truce
Descend on them the wrath of the merciless wolf

It took the failure of man to start this brotherhood of
wolves
And we've been bound by blood and fur to defend the
defenceless
They are the ever expanding plains, we leave no stone
unturned
This is our infinite task, to see mans cruelty burned

The ones who wear the Wolf's Head
The ones who bear the wolf's mask
The ones who howl in wolf song
Are the new hunters of man

When they cower they will scream for truce
Descend on them the wrath of the merciless wolf
