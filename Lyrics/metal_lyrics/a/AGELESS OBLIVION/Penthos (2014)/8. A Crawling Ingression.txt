Prowers of a hunter that claims the silhouette of a child
Eating into the trees as one with the forest breeze

The hairless back of a beast or two
Demented limbs and fingers ingrown, allied, entwisted
At bones with the wolves
Raised as their own on truths that of false

Harboured by a translucent brotherhood
And immersed in a carnality to hunt and devour
I shall pin back your eyelids
I shall peel the light from your days
Spread it over your skin and slowly remove the grey

Face the winds and discover the scent of men
Shed your lust to hunt, shed your lust to devour
SHED YOUR APOCRYPHAL SKIN

You mock us as weak
You tremble in our penance
You see us as grotesque
Yet you plea for our penance

Sheltered under your wing, immune from interaction
And exposed to nothing, merely specimens of curiosity

Words of rehabilitation and relief reamian as words
Empty oath worth all but dust

Mans conviction to greed overbearing the
remnants of truth
Empty oath worth all but dust

Face the winds and discover the putridity of man
Shed your lust to hunt, shed your lust to empower
SHED YOUR APOCRYPHAL SKIN

You try to feed us gruel, you cage us apart insulted and
demoralised
You have exhausted our hearts

Branded feral humans but we are not part of your
animosity governed race
And we will not abide within your restrains
We run as hunters
Your empty oath worth nothing but dust
