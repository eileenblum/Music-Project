Those who have chosen to feed of light
Deprived by the one who banished sight
Those who choose to devour purity
Expelled to the lands of emptiness
All your memories &amp; bountiful wisdom have been
stricken from you
You have become less than a man
Your tools, your possession, stripped from your hands

Starved and left detached, sent to wonder the abyss
The portrayers of an evil incarnate

For Those Who Fed of Light
You must concede to margins where there is no life
For those who commit to anguish
You will have no place to rest your bones
For Those Who Fed of Light
Embrace you will not anything of purity or the divine
Forever in the congress of night, for you serve the enemy
of light

You serve the enemy of light with endless shame

Those who have chosen to feed of light
Deprived by the one who banished sight
Those who choose to devour purity
Expelled to the lands of emptiness
All your memories &amp; bountiful wisdom have been
stricken from you
You have become less than a man
Your tools, your possession, stripped from your hands

Reside in darkness
For you chose to lose the way
Dwell now in the abyss
As you tried to steal the day

Undead, lifeless, inhuman, soulless and decayed
And hunted

You left the earth to tremor for aeons
The caress of light shall serve as you penance
And to it, you are bound
