I the indomitable titan roam and devastate the lands
I feel nothing, for I am hollow

Goliath, Behemoth, Colossus
Titan, Monster, Gargantuan

A cascade of depth within my chest
The hive lives and breathes
Without the shackles of pain or remorse
And wasp venom coursing inside me

I the indomitable titan roam and devastate the lands
Winter personified, heartless vessel

Goliath, Behemoth, Colossus
Tyrant, Miscreant, Adversary

To slay this beast would make us beasts ourselves
Nothing can stand in his way
100 men with ropes and chains
To bring him to his knees
To be banished to the keep
Rid of the light of day

Thunderous bellows and the struggle to keep him trapped
Fortune failing man in a co-ordinated attack
Countless lives taken away, in stone to be reborn
News of the failure drowned in voices now mourn

The legends tell this ageless Belial
Hid his hearth where no man could travel
Conflict in futile, leverage the only victory
A buried beating muscle, plunged into obscurity

An unfathomable place, a lifetime away

At a window a mother mourns her last begotten son
This pursuit will claim his life
By the hand of evil
Or gainless searching

To unearth subterranean essence
Seasons shift and aeons pass in time
Driven by misery since he began
He was once a child but now stands a broken aged man

Drawing near, but not alone, through the maze, the human
forest of stone
The heart beathing in his hand is resounding
Since its upheaval from the soil, an unmistakable
pounding

Face to face with the detested majesty
A supernatural oath scratched across the sky
To trade the lives of many, for the heart of one
Ill-fated consequence if the deal is undone

A charm for a chest, a malicious swarming nest

Now released, and free to go, their tears salt the soils and
nothing can grow
The winds and the lands reek of animosity, the tides have
now changed
The merciless one now begs for mercy
The heart of the adversary is crushed by the hatred of man
The oath unfulfilled, revenge is poison that blacks their
hands
The giant falls tearing at his chest, to release the wasps he
one possessed

A charm for a chest, a malicious swarming nest

Mans revenge claimed both their lives and in the end
Pyres are raised and both lives mourned together
