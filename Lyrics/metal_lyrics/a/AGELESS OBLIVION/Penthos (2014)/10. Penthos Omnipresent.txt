Mountains of stone
Woodlands which swell
Rivers that flow
I am part of all that's grown

Omnipresent
As populations burst forth
In lamentation I thrive
I am part of all that's life

I am the freezing snow
I am seas as deep as they go
The degradation of bone
I am part of all that's grown
