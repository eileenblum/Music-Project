Break away from humanity, step out the marching line
Corruption beyond belief, no sanctity will you find

You're afraid, scared of chance, stay a slave
Will you break yourself free?
Realize to survive what's contrived
Realize, use your mind, cut the ties
Cut loose the dead weight

Fuel the Furnace, the engines of negativity
The gears of oppression cloud the rivers in naivety
Fuel the Furnace, the belief in false deities
The need for depression, cloud the mind in obscurity

Break away from humanity, step out the marching line
Callousness beyond reason, no holiness will you find

You're afraid, scared of chance, stay a slave
Will you break yourself free?
You're alive, can you find a reason why?
Realize, use your mind, cut the ties
Cut loose the dead weight

Fuel the Furnace, the engines of negativity
The gears of oppression cloud the rivers in naivety
Fuel the Furnace, the belief in false deities
The need for depression, cloud the mind in obscurity

'Ignorance, our mother tongue'
Acceptance of what's to come

Nothing that will ever exist will surpass the laws of nature
Humanity in its arrogance holds itself above these laws
So far as believing the earth was created for the purpose
of their existence

The fundaments of the universe are that of entropy and
decay
All must go from a state of order to disorder
So far as believing the earth was created for the purpose
of their existence

This cancer is an agnorant and violent subspecies of ape
With tendencies towards superstition and ritual
These animals are content to blindly follow
Begging the question, how long can this go on?

For these is definitive reason to believe
Man will never reach his full potential
In his tenure on this earth
Before destroying himself
