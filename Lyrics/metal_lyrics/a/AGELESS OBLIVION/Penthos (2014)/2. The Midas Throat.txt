The curse of the Midas Throat
The touch of your hand can stop the beating of hearts and
the voice of man
You will act as death until the day you become death
yourself
Wielding the power of a god as you r lust for gold numbers
your days

Your wish has been granted
But a double edged sword that evaded your beloved
Is the curse of the Midas Throat

In madness and fear you embrace your beloved
And as she stands lifeless you curse the gods
But this is what you asked for
The golden touch
You wouldn't heed the warning of what it may cost

In your paranoia
They conspire against you
They'll take your crown and leave your bones
Unmarked in the ground

Neck deep in riches
Neck deep in distress

The no mans land between body and mind
The pleasure of wealth but a body on borrowed time

Three days without water, a fate no man can survive
There's no way of escape and nowhere to hide

You leave a path in your wake like no other
Your plight, this curse, your desire
To gorge on poisonous metal
Immolation by fire
Cheat the gods with suicide

It's immorlation by fire
Cheat the gods with suicide
'I am still Emperor'

Neck deep in riches
Neck deep in distress

The no mans land between body and mind
The pleasure of wealth but a body on borrowed time
The no mans land between life and death
As the only thing which passes through your throat will
be your last breath

In death, wealth is irrelevant, beg for deliverance from
starvation

DIONYSUS
Hear this prayer

In death I live through centuries in all I have created

DIONYSUS
Hear this prayer

Statues of loved ones withstand the test of time

What cannot feed will always cease to exist
A fundamental order that has no exception
Your insatiable grandeur
Took for granted lucid means to survive

Sound the horn
Our monarch is dead
For he now lies with a severed throath
