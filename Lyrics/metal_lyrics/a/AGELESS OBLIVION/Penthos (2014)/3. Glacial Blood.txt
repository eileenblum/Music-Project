Minds adrift, I've gone astray
Blood coursing like shifting plates
Blackened limbs grow rapidly inutile
I walk a buried path into the fray
Lord of the frost lands, drifter of the grey
I walk a buried path into the fray

Beyond contact, beyond salvation
Alone in an unreachable destination
Nothing to offer warmth or direction
Malevolent surroundings
Hostile freezing suffocation

As I go further into this artic void
Hypothermia
Perished skin
Through ice destroyed
Of life this wilderness is devoid

Minds adrift, I've gone astray
Blood coursing like shifting plates
Blackened limbs grow rapidly inutile
I walk a buried path into the fray

Beyond contact, beyond salvation
I wander alone with no precise direction
No-one to console my lamentation
It surrounds me
Adverse glacial abomination

Ice starts to preserve my body
Immobile I become
Loneliness acts as a catalyst to aberration
And as the ability to move evades me
My limbs become alike roots in the earth

Like roots in the earth
A burial fit for no man or beast
This body shall nurture not the soils
As the transformation completes

Fragmented in appearance
Parts break away from me
Body tightened
Giving up the fight
Drift into the final sleep
Exhausting astringent winds force my body into paralysis
My track are covered
No-one will know where I rest
Winters embrace

Adrift
The ice is all I know
Astray
As I become the snow
