Without me you not pleasure
Without me you not bliss
Without me the mind would unravel
To a permanent state of remiss

Neither above not below
Neither blessed nor unhallowed

I dwell in all that's hollow

This world will carry my throne
A sovereignty of branch and bone

I dwell in all that's hollow

The weight of an unliftable stone
Intractable power, I can't be overthrown
I dwell in all that's hollow

I remain misery and sorrow

I Lament the wounds that fortune deals
I remain in all that's unhealed
For I am as much a part of life as life itself

These roots grow from me to the earth and into all of its
beings
I am not a benign, nor hostile ever presence

Pull up roots, burn down trees
I will exist, always
tear down entire cities
I will exist, always

Seen by the eyes of many, spoken through the voice of all
Misery is absolute, always

I am the salt in your blood
I am your hands in the fire
There can be no solace without struggle
Through the mine

These roots grow not to restrict
Allow their growth, prevent their control
I am no illness or that which can be cured
There is no departure from what must be endured
For I am not foul
You need me to survive
You need me to realize the worth of life

I am no deirty, I accept no prayer
For I will bring no fortune
Regardless of that which you believe
I am as real as the soil
As the seas which churn
As if to worship fire
Fire still burns

I am the winds of human sorrow
I am the waves of no tomorrow
The time you live is the time you borrow
For I reside in all that's hollow
