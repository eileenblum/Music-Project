Throw me the cross, I fuse to my heart
Pray for release, I am so cold &amp; so weak
But relentless I stand.

Our quest incomplete, Cross hits the ground
We have yet to defeat, Our heroism confound

Through the mists the scent of the dead awakens
Shreds our morale, Our gruesome fate it beckons

Our quest incomplete, The winds bare no sound
All machines named obsolete, Our wounds tightly bound

Lightning strikes, Forces us to shelter
The skyâs domain it soils the land with acid rain
Cleanses our wounds
Corrosion drips from rusted towers
Concealing us throughout the showers
The heavens bleed while the clouds churn out burning ashes
Silhouetting this temple, Unveiling our castle
A haven for us, A shrine to rebuild our faith again

The metallic messiah appears so viscous
No chamber could overwhelm its existence
Our final twelve consumed by this
Abnormal Leviathan

Appearance of liquid steel
Aware still I grip my shield

And suddenly a tremble of stone
From the awakening of what lies beneath

Engulfed by a mechanical mucus
Clarity of our in-existence made visible

Encased within this iron womb
We have chosen our fate
We have created our tomb
