Denial could lead the path to your redemption or the path to your grave
Your ally, Your kingdom, Which one would you save?

The embers &amp; stone we can raise from the ground
Your body &amp; your flesh, No cure has been found

A flood of iron waves consumed our homes
Loved ones and daughters have been beheaded by drones

A Nuclear Burial of all we possess
Our valour &amp; glory is all we have left
From the remnants of our empire we shall re-build
From broken hearts, broken homes &amp; shattered bones
We are architects left with a pallet of stones

Our debt paid in blood

We are merely inadequate, Servants to the beholder of mists
Tenants to his bludgeoning fists

Our land, our faith is not our own
Shadowed by the doubt of an empty throne
We lost men, They lost machines
Now a truce is dealt the slate is wiped clean

With a promise in blood, Scribed on the sand
We must not cross onto their land
Exiled from this earth, We are to obey
Destroyed all we know form the light of day

Now one year passed
The stones we laid evolved into mass creation
The impossibility of reformation has proved to be our destiny

Towers now stand that intimidate the skies
Yet forged within shadows
The resurrection of new lives

Beyond our capability, We shall prosper with the invent of immortality
Our creations spread doubt over their realityâs

Convinced we have burst the moulds
But with the strength of ten men
Watch the horror unfold

Appearance so humane, So they are not to know
With a detachable faceplate ingrown

So that our identities are not shown
