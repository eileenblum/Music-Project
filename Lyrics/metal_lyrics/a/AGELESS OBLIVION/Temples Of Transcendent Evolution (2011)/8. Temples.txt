Past efforts fought &amp; crumbled as of our frail descendants
Night falls over our kingdom of forgotten souls
An appalling redemption waits behind the gates
of the rising sun

Our creations, Drones of untold sacrifice
Merely crushed into a fine dust.
Their eternal march begins to the chorus of the stagnant

Beckon the dawn of destruction
Mankindâs great repression

Smoke seeps from the temples in which they dwell
We glance at the inglorious structure
Their Temples Of A Transcendent Evolution.

Our embodiment, The deathbed to our leaders execution.

These times see man meeting his malfunction
A weakness they will use to bludgeon
Such a reckless oblivion ignites a frenzy of sacrifice
To serenade a worthless eternity

Earth shakes to the tremble of a thousand frightened men
A fuel they will burn again &amp; again

The sound of stones thudding into our frail bodies
Pulse hammer force, Machine gun speed
No words can speak the agony we will concede

Smashed to bits torn to fucking shreds
Our entrails contaminate the machines treads
A short sharp violent thrust leaves your insides in your hands
Not a battlefield but a slaughter ground
These godforsaken lands

Our malfunction, a weakness they will use to bludgeon
Such a reckless oblivion ignites a frenzy of sacrifice
To serenade our worthless eternity

And the last breath, For heaving earth
Has become the descent into our expiration
Decomposing reality led us to our embodiment
The aftermath

DESTINED TO BE DEVOURED BY MACHINE
