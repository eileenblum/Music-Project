One day you saw a man
You brought it to be someone you know
Night after night you dream of a fox
The beast covered in blood

For months you see the man
And dream of the fox
Your mind covered in death
Until the day you can not sleep

Sleepless you lie
And in solitude you die
Fr the deepest regrets
And the sentinels a path has been set

The candles are lit
Lights black as carbon
The reaper's blade sharpened
Eyes, fangs and burning fur
