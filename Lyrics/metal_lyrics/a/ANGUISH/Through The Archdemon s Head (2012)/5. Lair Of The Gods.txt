Vaults of the obsolete
Cathedral of the elite
Tones from the deepest of space
Showing the nature of Her

The myth revealed
And the magick sealed
Tearing dreams apart
In the Lair of Gods

Reaper of the abyss
Challenging the throne
A coat of burning fur
and ears of drone

Cold paws pound the ground
Falling stars crushing down
Upon the roof of gods to die
Underneath a soylent green sky
Aftermath of a shaking universe
Nothing left to preserve

Doomsday will reign upon the world
Wicked eyes that now see
Rules the creation
No more lair for dead gods
