Enough can never be enough
A prayer for a prayer
Gaining more to your consensus root

For the millions of years
That you will exist
Henceforth, the demon inside
Sheds it skin

Transparent you will become
Before this demon tranquil
The veil, the veil, the veil
Urgent to prevail

Gaze through the mirrors of sail
And she'll strike you eyes
All the strength she can bring
While she vibrates a chaotic string

The veil, the veil, the veil

The veil, obsessed by this veil
The veil, the veil, the veil
Urgent to prevail
The veil, the veil, the veil
Urgent to prevail
Obsessed by this veil

With the might of her voice, she'll sing
Like a thermal wave, wiping mind clean
Erased and replaced, gaze upon her face
The veil, the veil, the veil
Obsessed by this veil
Enough can never be enough
Mark my words
