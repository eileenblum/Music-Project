I saw my family burn
the fire rose to the sky
The flame of every concern
Her eyes pierced
As my emotions screamed why
Illuminous she was illusive

Midst the flames she stood
The first time I saw her
Siugnah
God of Fox

Along the flames she licked
Enchanting fangs
The first time I saw her
Midst the flames she stood
Siugnah, God of Fox

Inferno burned in my head
Emotions at breaking point
As she killed my pack
I threw myself at her aggressively
But she embraced me
Filled me with love of disorder
