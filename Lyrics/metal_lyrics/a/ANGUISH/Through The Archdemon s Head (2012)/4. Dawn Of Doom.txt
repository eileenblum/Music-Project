I am floating in darkness
My fate is true
In endless agony
I will realize my defeat

My soul is now lost
Hunted by the thrusting dead

I am lurking in shadows
But there is no hope
for my dying veins
My life is forsaken
The word of ancient time is upon me
My life is ending faster then it

My anguish is deep
My soul eternal bleed
The black moon burns my fate
I start to realize the end is near

I am a living dead fiend
I can eternally feel
I can eternally see
through the moon and the sun

I can now eternally feel
I can eternally see
through the moon and the sun
I am a living dead fiend

The dawn of doom
