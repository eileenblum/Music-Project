At the gallows of the edge
Points a star towards a deep
At the bottom of this demon
a land with no end stands

Gruesome is the keeper
The Chaos Judge will demand
And visitors have to call
Otherwise the veil won't hold
and the gods of damnation will berserk

Feeding on the creation
Casting a shadow over universal law

When the ancients dare to walk
When the ancients dare to walk
Upon the ever changing laws

Feeding on the creation
Casting a shadow over universal law
And Siugnah wrecks havoc on the last standing

Gruesome is the keeper
The Chaos Judge will demand
And visitors have to call
Otherwise the veil won't hold

When the ancients dare to walk
Upon the ever changing laws
When the ancients dare to walk
