I saw the chapel, stare at me
What evil doings are done by that shrine
Tiles of hatred are upon me

Cursed are the ones who enter
An ancient evil is waiting there
Surrounding this castle
Join with the dead or prepare to be sacrificed

Enter this halls and accept your own death
or stay outside to be untouched and alone

In this evil place, the place to find wicked darkness

The castle is calling to me
WELCOME IN
I can't resist thee
I WILL GRANT YOU PEACE
Oh numinous castle
I AM NO FIEND
Please let me be
Ooh no!

Your hole cross is doomed
Doomed to hell
Feel the spirits dwell
In this evil chapel
Only the black candles are alive
Only evil are welcome in here
Only evil are true
