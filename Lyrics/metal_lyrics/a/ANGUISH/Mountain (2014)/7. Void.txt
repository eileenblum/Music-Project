Cold cavity, dark
I am all alone
I am one, dying
We are no legion
I poured all resources into the well of life
And nothing I get in return
My still living eye observes it all
The whole consensus of the divine (construct)

I am all alone
I hear their cries
We used to be one
I am all alone

The bearer of the demons head, they call me
The northern shining one, they say
She is no more, the Archdemon
I can still hear her laugh, alone
Unable to move, unable to sing
I am all alone, silenced by the veil
shackled by the massive being
I behold his eye, staring at her head

Angry I burn
Soulless I die
Worshipped I am
A burning god
I behold and there is light
When I spit beings die
Alone, in the casket I lie

The stare of eternity
It burns, I feel it
We all used to be one
Now they all stare
Alone they stare

I am all alone
I hear their cries
We used to be one
I am all alone
