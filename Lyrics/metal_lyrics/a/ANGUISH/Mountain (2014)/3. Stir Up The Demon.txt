I hear you from the depths
You whisper to me
The light you'll never see
What do you mean?
I murdered him

I murdered him
There he lies, smiling
kneeing next to him
It is her, staring at me
Madness
madness
I only see madness
She should not be
What does this mean?
Laughter echoes in me
It is not her, not him

But me, laughing grim
The war stopped, they all see
Witchkings never die
I should have known
His allegiance is malign
did I not see the signs 

I murdered him
There he lies, smiling
kneeing next to him
It is her, staring at me
