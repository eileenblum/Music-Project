By the banner of gods
Under a watchful moon
As the winds chant on
The sky pillar rose
Without fear and regret
With blood on their souls
Until the end they met
As the eternal ghouls
The Snow-Hammer forged
In the caverns of hellfire
By acolytes of gods
The Snowhammer forged
Against the other gods

Let them be crushed
See them be bled
Make them crawl in excrement
Kill the flames
Artifact, Snow-Hammer
Strike upon, Snow-Hammer
Drench the land, SnowHammer
Slay the gods, Snow-Hammer
Choke the fire, Snow-Hammer
Guide us forth, Snow-Hammer
Show us doom, Snow-Hammer
Let them know, Snow-Hammer
Be gone, Archdemon

Please, show them the answer
to what is things to come
they might be blind to the convict
The master of the peak's ignores
Show to them the hammer
bane of gods be gone
Asphyxiator of flames
the artifact of old
Cold

Let them be crushed
See them be bled
Make them crawl in excrement
Kill the flames
Be gone, Archdemon
