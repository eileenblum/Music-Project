Foundation of flesh and star
Looting the pool of matter
Citing the stench of vibration
As clouds form the flowing paste of migration 
Faster than life it succumbs
In that instant flash
Limb by limb views dawn
Singing clash between hammer and anvil 
Embers of the ever-burning
Fueling the factorys creation
As the smithing sons hammer rave
To save this tribe from wandering astray
Through this sea of doom
His anger on this world
Will manifest in such way
That the vibrant veil will be torn and caved 
Singing steel,
River of life sail away

Crawling cold, reaping fire
The dark sea of mystery
There you stand, mythic elder
Markarian Furnace, you liar

Distant burn, celestial steel
From the Markarian Furnace
The hammer's feel
Born of fire, lived by flames
Markarian furnace, relieved be thy names
Upon the face of planets, mark the stars
Be not the end, but nurture the wars
Feed the fallos, with the greed
For conflicts to come, plant the seed

Crawling cold, reaping fire
The dark sea of mystery
There you stand, mythic elder
Markarian Furnace, you liar
