Time be your enemy
Weather be your god
Death be your contingency
Night be your ally
Above Peak's Fall he dreams
A behemoth gazing
at the stars rising above
For thousands of years of wondering
and the choir of Peak's Fall will holler
Thundering voices of deities

The seasons chant in the evening sun
as day fades into darkness 
shadows engulf the mountain
washing over the castle 
somnambulance
Five hundred years has passed
the ancient folk of Fall
The awakening of the slumbering one, forgotten
The choir long has ceased

Malevolent eyes flash open
Staring wild around
Early it wakes in oblivion
To a non existing sound
The peaks silence was deafening
to which it lost its mind
break open the mountain wall
and shake the world with its roar

The seasons chant in the evening sun
as day fades into darkness 
shadows engulf the mountain
washing over the castle 

Upon this land eternal winter hammers
Desolation crawl across the summit
growling for ever and ever 
This region of malevolence
And its soil depleted
Mountains dominate
Peak's Fall died, but its master
never could
