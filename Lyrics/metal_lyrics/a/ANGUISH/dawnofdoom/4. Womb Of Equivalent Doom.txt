Far away in a violent world
A phenomenon is escalating
A vast belief of sacred healing
Rather a wish to die for nothing

The legion of magicians assembles beyond
They aim at the numinous altars of madness
As the travelling party enters the dominion
The akrolytes of the altars of madness reacts

Stumbling across watery tombs and rotted graves
One man figures out the meaning about the mist
A coversation between him and the moon is born

The birth of an invocation which decipher the words

Initiation is now complete

The mystical magick of the altar will now be released
Darkness will run like blood by your feet
Chaos troops and doom are now unleashed
Every dimension lies in strong fundamental kaamos
All because of the womb of equivalent damnation

Silence
