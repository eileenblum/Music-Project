I see the chapel stare at me
What Evil doings are done by that shrine
Rites of hatred is at hand

Curse are the one who enter
An ancient evil is waiting in there
It's around this castle
Join with the dead or prepare to be sacrificed

Enter these halls and accept your own death
Or stay outside to be untouched and alone

In this evil place, the place to find wicked darkness

The castle is calling to me "Welcome in!"
I can't resist thee "I shall grant you peace!"
Oh, numinous castle "I am no fiend!"
Please, let me be!
Oh no!

Your holy cross is doomed
Doomed to hell
Feel the spirits dwell
In this evil chapel
Only the black candles is alive
Only evil is welcome in here
Only evil is true
