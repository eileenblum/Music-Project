I am floating in darkness
My fate is true
In endless agony I will realise my defeat

My soul is now lost
Haunted by the thrusting dead

I am lurking in the shadows, but there is no hope
For my dying veins
My life is forsaken
The words of ancient times

My anguish is deep
My soul eternal bleed
The black moon burns my fate
I start to realise the end is near

I am a living dead fiend
I can eternally feel
I can eternally see
Through the moon and the sun

I can now eternally feel
I can eternally see
Through the moon and the sun
I'm a living dead fiend

The dawn of doom
