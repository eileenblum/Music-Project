The obscure presence of him
None can see his imperialistic path
Flawless in all its shapes
Shameless in all its actions

She can see the signs
Also hidden in the white mist
Able to follow he who dwells
But unable to conquer

As the serpent manifest
The stench of deceit reeks
For this is a kingdom of None
A limitless plane where no one reigns

The snake of Obscura hunts
For the entity of greatest might
Our father, our sun observes
He knoweth what to happen

With no success the serpent draws back
The vicious and the wise comes forth
To slay the weak reptile
And empty its blood

With the blood of the serpent flowing
With their own, its knowledge is now theirs
She, with her already great wisdom ascend
He, knower of Death descend into oblivion

Both now opened up
With nothing obscured
And with thrusting might
Both breathing disgust for each

Victims of the occult meaning
With every angle and shape so perfected
Invincible in all its forms
Targets for the other gods

Flexible like fluid and strong as gravity
From the chaos womb they descend
Through celestial gates they feed
On all that lives, and that are dying

Dematerialized spheres and black stars
Marks their presence on this cosmic altar
From the seas, from the earth, from the dark beyond
A mockery against the cosmic creation

Tearing atom from particle
Waves from Sound
Horror from fear
Cutting the strings of existence

The Chaos Judge

One dark winter night
Lying dead in the blazing cold
Like cocaine so imperialistic white
A magickal scent, horrific to hold

A repugnant vision, stiffened
Its shell flashed red as fire
The dead eyes alive, observing
She has seen the malign of the liar

Hsiugna

With her tongue and her tail
This Daemon binds herself to me
From a dimension far she hail
Giving a warning for all to see

Death is coming
