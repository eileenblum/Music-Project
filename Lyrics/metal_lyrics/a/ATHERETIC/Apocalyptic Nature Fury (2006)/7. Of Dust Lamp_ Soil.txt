[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

The empire of man, from extracted material
Built from the earth
A modern myth of metal and wood

Home of the animal realm
Nest for every organism
Living cycle equilibrium
Rooted to the core

The very essence of life on the planet
A disturbance is created, without remorse

Beneath our feet
Lies the symbol of stability
On the surface
Growing lungs forestry

The sand, the rock, the land
The perpetual beauty of mountains
The eternal solidity of stone
Will be crushed from years of abuse

Dirt that gives us life
Ungrateful treatment
Towards the terrestrial matter
Enough is enough

From forest fire and pollution mayhem
The earth eventually responds
By movement of the crust and separation of the ground
She will not tolerate this intoxication anymore

Counter-attack devastation
In damaging earthquake form
Destructive volcano eruptions
Eradicate this pathetic kingdom

Anger of the ground
Breaking the foundation of mankind
The structure collapses in pure
Apocalyptic nature fury

Born of dust and soil, living of dust and soil
Feeding of dust and soil, dying from dust and soil

We feed from dead earth, our death feed the earth
Humanity shall be reduced to dust

Beneath our feet lies the symbol of stability
On the surface, growing lungs forestry

Born of dust and soil, living of dust and soil
Feeding of dust and soil, dying from dust and soil

Humanity shall be reduced to dust
