[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

Feeling, dreaming, flowing, it nurtures the earth
Morphing the shape
Cleaning, washing, filtering, it purifies the heart
Fashions the landscape

Unstable - as the wave breaks the rock

Mysteriously swamped through thoughts
Devoted to an internal serenity
Inside the womb, the fluid of life
Outside the tomb, apathy for the coward

Another world lies profound
Million phantoms deep
Crystal clear abyss in which we fall
Like a heavy depression, covering all

The lost of eternal compassion, is the result of immaturity
Release the river...
In a struggle to break free

Emotional - as the storm brings sorrow
Aquatic redemption for the worthless breed
Emerge into unstoppable flood
Pouring fatally with no chance to breathe
Supreme rebellion of the planet's blood

Ocean of tranquillity, resting peacefully
A motion so calm, sleeping temporarily

Do not awake the sleeping water...

Tears from the sky
Deception of the mother
Neglected, she rises frustrated
For the trust they took for granted
Drown, as your thirst is insatiable
Exploited to the level of obsession

A warning
Blue color alarm
Slowly swallows the sound
The coming of a glacial era

Paralysed by ice
Blinded by snow
A liquid demise
Violent flow

Taste the fury of the element
For you did deserve to be left in the cold
