[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

A new beginning
Cold breeze bringer of spring
Blowing dust away
The old will shine again
Regeneration, a natural process of living

Breathing, to reborn into new skin like snake
Reason, brought back to life, a perpetual movement
Of truthful wisdom
Eternal means of communication
Abstracted creation
A profound yellow

Omnipresent in its form
The invisible force
A quest for oxygen
Fill our lungs with power to carry on

Untouchable - like thoughts and spirit
Uncontrollable - like passing your hand through it

Cyclones to dominate
A ruler in absolute gravity
In my absence suffocate
Tornadoes to destroy stability

Sword of justice
Natural disaster retaliation
Catastrophic weapons of conviction
Hail to the mother's revenge

Intuitive scream to provoke the wind
Like a cloud invading
Essential speech to awake the mind
Like a ghost haunting

Like a ghost haunting
Essential speech to awake the mind
Like a cloud invading
Intuitive scream to provoke the wind

Aerial master of persuasion
Divine king of transparency

Purify the surrounding
Consciously filtering the poison
Purify the body
Endlessly clearing the vision
Purify the soul

Omnipresent in its form
The invisible force
A quest for oxygen
Fill our lungs with power to carry on

Untouchable - like thoughts and spirit
Uncontrollable - like passing your hand through it
