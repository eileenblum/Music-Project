[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

Born of chaos from the dawn of time
A cellular rejection claiming the world
So-called masters, self-proclaimed kings God-like phenomenon

Centuries of war and conflict
Exaggerated industrial growth
In the name of stupidity, they don't realize
Neglecting the earth, a self-demise

Living in false guidance
Hypothetic version of the origin
Believing pretentiously
Foolish version of the truth

Survival instinct to dominate
Obsessed by greed, religion-blinded
All this science is pure illusion
And they call it evolution

Economy over ecology
Breaking the balance
This madness won't stand eternally
Pushing the planet into decadence
At the end they will pay for their defiance

Satisfaction of needs has a limit
Accumulations of profits are endless
History of humanity
A quest for power
The peak of his maturity
Is nuclear fire

Unaware of the repercussions
Absurd progress leading to extinction
Lack of respect for nature
Doomed to a complete failure?

Every race seems to be destined
To perish under the hand of man
When none is left to destroy
Mankind will eliminate itself

Crushed by the same nature
They sought to control

Environment into depression
A culture aiming perfection
Turning to global regression
And they still call it evolution?
