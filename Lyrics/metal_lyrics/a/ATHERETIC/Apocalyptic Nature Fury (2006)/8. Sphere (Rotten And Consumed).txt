[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

Revenge is upon us
A catastrophic prophecy
Lightning strikes, mountain of fire
Severe power from the sky in anger

A nature uncontrolled
Chaotic nightmare unfold
Pathetic breed in danger
Enhancing the fear of the future

Burning, drying, dead baby
Lying in the desert miserably
A monument of the path followed
Example of inhumanity

Too late to react
Too strong to attack
Elements united in terror

Destitution of believes
Desecration of hopes
Unconscious degradation

Irreversible process
Furious purge
Carnage of biblical proportion

A sphere rotten and consumed
Fruit of life killed from its roots
Broken tree from witch the seed remains

A social holocaust
Fatal retribution
Movement marking history
Changing the world, here and beyond...
