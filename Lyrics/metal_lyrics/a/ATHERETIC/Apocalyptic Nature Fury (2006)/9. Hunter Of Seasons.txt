[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

Frozen, lifeless, degrading reality
Wanting to believe the absurd
Hypocratic orgy of thoughts
Deeply plunged in a bemused gullibility

Participate to exterminate unconsciously
Overconfident determination
Persuade of a self-centered fantasy
Bother not of the surroundings
Presented on a golden platter
Purity victim of betrayal
Hitched by an handicap
Trip into dead nature
Seeing yet not the waste

Separation impossible, no self-sufficiency
Devote yourself, divorce from liberty
Destroy your need for security

Weak resting sure upon a dream
A necessity of survival
Selfishly raping what is believed to be divinity
Fear not faithful followers forgiveness it shall traditionally
Soil enriching is all you shall be

Permitting not to, think of thy-self
Now fold and realize your procurement
Overconfident deterioration, convinced of a superior existence
Adapting not to the surroundings, act foolishly betray your roots
Without regard of moral intentions
Scavenger, bastard, profiteer, ignoramus
Supreme being fall before me for then we shall see

Violently storming, modify ecology, breed in dignity
Overpopulate shamelessly, comprehension leads to destruction
Violently storming, devastate ecology

Revolt results in casualties
Comprehension, now it's too late
Earth, point in the universe
Burdened by stirred up ignorance

Of those who turn by turn rip it's distant visions
Mother Nature dissected by the incoherence of humanity too proud
The natural troops shall eliminate all hunters of seasons
But the human race disabled of innate logic
Surely shall succeed to commit suicide well before
