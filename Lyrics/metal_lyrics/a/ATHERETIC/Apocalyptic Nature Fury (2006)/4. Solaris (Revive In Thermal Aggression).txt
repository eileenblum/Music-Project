[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

Power of cosmic origin
Misunderstood by the ancients
Elevating the race above
Central point of dismal evolution

False mastery of the element
The passion of the sun
Enlightenment of the dance ablaze
Hypnotized by the symbol of south
Anger of dragon grows

Red is the vision, waiting below
Transformed: a vindictive glow
Adapting to a destructive form

Under the rules of the nature
His will burst out of control
All hopes are melting within the core
Burning forevermore

Incinerate the surface
Leaving the horizon to ashes
As the cleansing evolves
The place is laid for renewal

Natural instinct to purify
True display of ruthless courage

Fire is hatred for egoism
Lust and jealousy, gluttony and envy
Roasted to the bone

Relentless flames of redemption
Procedures condemned to combustion
The phoenix reborn
Revived in thermal aggression

Everlasting summer
Solar energy
Infamous fever
Volcanoes fury
