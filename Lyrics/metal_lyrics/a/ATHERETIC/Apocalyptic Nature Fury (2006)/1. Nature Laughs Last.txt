[Music: Dany Leblanc]
[Lyrics: Alexandre Leblanc]

Polluting machine driven by greed
He turned against the source of his life
Stealing and killing, he fights his own kind
Instead of sharing to survive

Rationalized, the resources fade
Still...
he doesn't understand the mistakes made

Climatic system reversed
The planet strikes back against his cancer
An attempt to break the curse
Of this careless kind who took away his power
Fertile ground turns into desert
Tropical land morphing to winter
Extreme melting at the poles
Ice turns into invading water

Global claustrophobia
As the land gets smaller
Earth wide paranoia
As the planet unleash the fury

Believers shall scream apocalypse
Engulfed in their ignorance
No god will save their soul
As the mother of all things reply

Like suicide to win a war
Eradicate the surface
Put asleep for centuries
Destroying the world to build anew

As this era ends abruptly
A new cycle take place
All the ones who exploited before
Will be forgotten in history
Unconscious that they burn it fast
Unprepared for the final blast
Nature laughs last
