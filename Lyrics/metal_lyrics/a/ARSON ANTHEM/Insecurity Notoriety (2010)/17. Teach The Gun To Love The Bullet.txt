: Williams]

Bring your love home trophy form taken out of context
The evil is in the details the proof is in the autopsy
The holy order is disorder awkward silence
Reserved to the fact black around the eyes
Stubborn last words teach the gun to love the bullet
Point blank range can you pull it?

Abusing the truth co-occurring error
Sarcastic to the fault sands of borrowed time
Teach the gun to love the bullet
Point blank range can you pull it?
