Llora
A solas
Atrapado en un rincÃ³n.
Todo se va
Quedando atrÃ¡s,
SÃ³lo puede recordar.
Ya no hay rival
Con quien luchar,
No hay batallas que ganar.
Su vida dio
Por su libertad,
Y ahora es libre en soledad.
En dÃ­as de guerra y horror
Su vida entera entregÃ³, negando el amor.
Su espada era su Ãºnico don,
Su amiga fiel nunca jamÃ¡s le fallÃ³,
Su acero es su piel, su filo el corazÃ³n.
Quisiera volver
A empezar
Y no entiende que da igual.
La soledad
De nuevo serÃ¡
Su compaÃ±era y su rival.
Su alma convive en paz
Con sus recuerdos que se van
Quedando atrÃ¡s.
El cree que no puede luchar
Pero es mÃ¡s fuerte el corazÃ³n que su dolor,
Su furia vendrÃ¡, de nuevo reinarÃ¡.

[English translation]

DAYS OF GLORY

I'm cryin'
Alone
Torn apart in a corner
Everything becomes far away in time
I can only remember.
I've got no more rivals
To fight with
No battles to win
He spent his whole life
For his own freedom
And now he's free in solitude
To days of war and horror
His entire life he dedicated, denying to himself even love
His sword was his only gift,
His faithful friend that never betrayed him
Its steel is his own skin, its edge is his own heart.
He wishes to come back
To start again
And to have no equals
Loneliness shall be again
His fellow and his enemy.
His soul lives together in peace
With his rememberances
Becoming more and more remote
He believes he cannot fight
But his heart is stronger than his pain
His fury shall come, he shall rule again.
