Sin mÃ¡s
Un triste destino me trajo aquÃ­.
AlÃ¡ me enviÃ³ en su honor.
Quiero volver,
No pienso morir por Ã©l.
Mi fe
JamÃ¡s ha tenido ni la tendrÃ¡.
ExtraÃ±o lugar conquistÃ³.
Â¿Por quÃ© he de creer
Que he de morir
Luchando por Ã©l
Y asÃ­ el cielo obtener?
Para Ã©l
Mi vida no es nada ni lo serÃ¡.
Se ve que no sabe perder.
Mis hombres estÃ¡n
Viendo el final
AlÃ¡, Â¿dÃ³nde estÃ¡?
No puedo creer en Ã©l.
Dicen que su nombre has de adorar
Postrarte de rodillas en su altar,
Incluso tu vida has de dar, y matar.
Dicen que asÃ­ el cielo obtendrÃ¡s.
Soy de otra cultura, otro lugar,
Y ahora esta derrota he de aceptar,
De aquÃ­ a mis hombres sacar,
Si no lo hago yo
Se que el jamÃ¡s lo harÃ¡.

[English translation]

DON'T ASK ME TO BELIEVE IN YOU

With nothing more than a mournful destiny
I've come this way.
There I was sent in his honour.
I wish to return
I don't mean to die for him.

My faith has never resisted
And it never will.
I conquered a strange place.
Why should I believe
That I have to die fighting for him
In order to gain a place in heaven?
For him my life is nothing
And never will be.
Maybe I'm no likely to lose
My comrades are seeing the end
There, where is he?
I can't believe in him.
They say you have to worship his name
To kneel down before his altar,
For him you've got even to give your life, and to kill.
They say this way you'll gain heaven.
I belong to another culture, another land
So now you've got to accept this defeat,
And I've got to lead my comrades away from here,
'cause if I won't do it myself
I know he'll never do it.
