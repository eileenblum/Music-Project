Closing my eyes you were always there
Stared back at me like a mirror
If no-one's here to show you the way
Will you walk in that line
That leads you astray?   

Before you were born I faced the choice
Existence only a dream
My gift to you, this dream of life   

The day you were born I saw joy in your face
With virtue and faith to grow strong
Of all the things I could give in this world
To help you survive, to keep you alive   

Do you believe in destiny?
What makes you think 
you're the doer of your actions
The Good, The Evil... what a quandary   

Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one
Let me be your guide
And in life you will learn to fly   

It's like a mirror so much left to be had
Your innocence soon will be tested
Looking ahead, seeing the lead 
this life so new
The stars wait for you
As you grow you'll be tempted to stray
Your conscience pushed to the limit
Trust in the voice you know to be true   

My poor little thing
Don't fear, you're not so innocent, or are you?
Don't doubt. The doubts will make you feel worse   

Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one
I will be your guide
And in life you will learn to fly   

Now you sleep well, little boy don't cry
In the morning a new light will shine
I'll erase your fear forever
And the darkness will dissappear
Little boy don't cry, little boy don't cry   

In the eyes of God you are all the same
Some possess the good, others all the pain   

Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one
(trust in me, I'm your guide)
I will be your guide
Come to my arms and shed no tears
Trust in me little one
(trust in me, I'm your guide)
I will be your guide
And in life you will learn to fly   

Show me your other cheek,
I would like to see it
He likes that, it makes him feel good
It's all the same to me
I think you're one of mine
He got rid of you
I will give you shelter
I'll ask you no questions
I won't even doubt you
I know what you're like, and you're not bad
There's no difference between good and evil
And if there is, it's too late for you
