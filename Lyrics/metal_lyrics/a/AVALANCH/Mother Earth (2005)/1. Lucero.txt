In front of me 
Her hair flies as the wind blows
Like a cool breeze
I sense her silhouette as she goes
She walks right past me
As my passion grows   

I hear her walk by
Almost driving my soul mad
A scream I hold inside 
As a lump grows in my throat
Of all the things I could say
I make no sound   

From the darkness it grows
Blinding me like a bright light
Reaching out for my love
Touching me on this cold night
She'll never know how I feel
I'll never know if she is for real 
She'll never hear my lament cry
That's screaming deep inside of me   

I dream of her face
Don't know how to describe her 
I'm leaving this place
Tonight will be my last call
To hear her tender voice
Just one more night
