When I succeed, I'm thinking of you
You could have stayed and seen this thing through 
Where the wind blows, where it takes you 
You don't care because you've no clue
I admit I trusted in you
I admit I got so screwed by you
Here I stand unshaken and
I don't mind this price I must pay to survive   

Bring it on... Bring it on...   

One hundred times fallen
One hundred times risen again 
I fight with all I am
Never looking back
One hundred times faltered
One hundred times stronger am I
I look into the mirror
No one's by my side   

I'd like to see you walk in my shoes
To teach the lesson and not to amuse
Now regret is your only friend
It is you who lose in the end
Take a look at all of my wounds
See how they healed this season anew
I still stand unshaken and 
I don't mind this price I must pay to survive
