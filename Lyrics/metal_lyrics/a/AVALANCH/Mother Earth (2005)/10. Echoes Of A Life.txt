Echoes of a life
Resounding from in his soul
Sacrificed freedom cries
Echoes from a light
Reflections of his hard work
He was building his own life
For a soul meant to fly   

He smiles like a little boy
No hope in his eyes
But cries like a grown man
Tears he never should have cried   

Purity of a soul
So noble heart of gold
How easily it falls apart
Then came that great war
Looking down with evil eyes
Filling his life with... with
Horrors better left behind   

I will not forget 
To sing of his song
With pride and with gratitude that the world couldn't show
I wish I could sit by your side once again
To hear of adventures
And to know how you are
I'll never understand
How we've forgotten him 
He witnessed our births   

Echoes of a life
Reaching out from his soul
Sacrificed freedom cries
For the old man's leaving now
Echoes from the light
Reflections of his hard work
He will rise with the
Memories of a time
Sounding forever
Echoes of his life
