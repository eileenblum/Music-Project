Oh Lord of this grey world
Bring colour to my life
Inspire me in my song
With all that's good to make me strong
Oh Lord of this grey world
Give me one more day to heal
Turn my tears to a river of notes
Into an ocean of melodies   

Oh Lord of this grey world
The sun hides its light from me
A darkness blacker than blackest night
Leaves me blinded with no insight   

Have the poets all left us?
Words written, forgotten and no one cares
Have the poets all left us?
Like dead roses in gardens of sadness
Their petals fall like the tears I cried for thee
Have the poets all left us?
Will anyone mourn this loss with me
Have the poets all left us?
On their tomb is a secret in stone, 
it's a poem of love
That no one recalls... no one recalls   

Oh Lord of this grey world
Have you gone too? Why do you hide?
Send my spirit into the night
And set this song into flight   

In this age that lacks of grace
Where poets die and leave no trace
Do I toil this night long
All for a rhyme, all for a song?   

Tell me why
I can't free the melody inside of me
Tell me why
I can't find the muse for just one more song...   

Have the poets all left us?
Words written, forgotten and no one cares
Have the poets all left us?
Like dead roses in gardens of sadness
Their petals fall like the tears I cried for thee
Have the poets all left us?
Will anyone mourn this loss with me
Have the poets all left us?
On their tomb is a secret in stone, 
it's a poem of love
That no one recalls...
