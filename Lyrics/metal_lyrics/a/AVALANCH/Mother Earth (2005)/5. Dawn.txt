Maybe this time
You will understand
The reason I wrote for you this song
I need to sing it out now
My heart isn't made of stone
It has not forgotten 
Still thinks of thee
Speaks to me all the time
It tells me of the days gone by
Living in this world with your love
And cries for that great loss
Please hear its call
Saying that I need you
Hoping you feel as I do
A smile from you would send me to heaven
To the kingdom of your love 
And we could be together
And all of this sadness will be gone   

Once I broke the ice surrounding you
And my voice reached your heart and soul
Spoke to them hidden in a song
And then my soul was burned by your fire so tender
Heat of your love... then everything was gone
Just ashes of what was 
Reminding me who I am
Just another dreamer
Only a fool in the shadow of your smile 
Who lives and cries hidden inside
And for your love, I would give away my soul
Hear how I sing your song
Abandoned on a lost road
Can't you see I still love you?
