Bitter darkness all around
Laughing at my loneliness
I can see through these grey bars
And the light is fading out
From far away voices call me
Reminding me of the life I once had
And again, I have to face my plight
Make me strong on this lonely night   

Between the sea and the sky
I can find hope and still see the light 
Echoes of the life that I did have
My hope springs eternal and will not die
These dreams refuse to fade to black 
Alone in my solitude
A prisoner of lies   

Innocent? No one cares
Yet again, the truth ignored
Does it matter? Should I care?
What is not, what is not fair?
From far away voices call me
Reminding me of my former life
Dry the tears that wash you from my mind
And regain what was once mine   

Between the sea and the sky
I can find hope and still see the light 
Echoes of the life that I did have
My hope springs eternal and will not die
These dreams refuse to fade to black 
Alone in my solitude
Between two lives   

Who's there? Jailer with no face
Who's there? Free me from this place
What am I? Am I still a man?
Dear God hear my plea
Set me free from this lie   

Between the sea and the sky
I can find hope and still see the light 
Echoes of the life that I did have
My hope springs eternal and will not die
These dreams refuse to fade to black 
Alone in my solitude
Between two lives   

Between the sea and the sky
I can find hope and still see the light 
Echoes of the life that I did have
My hope springs eternal and will not die
These dreams refuse to fade to black 
Alone in my solitude
Prisoner of lies
