The coldest winter has begun
And it's coming for me
This lifeless place I have been sent to
It is all new to me
I can feel it starting to freeze
I know this never have been
And nothing could stop it 
Strong as the wind blows
I'm a shadow beneath this cloud
Can not remember where I came from
I'm screaming out loud cause it scares
The hell out of me
And it's so far to fall   

Long I have fought just to get here
But now you're so far in that grey hole 
Shouldn't be free
Don't want to forget but it's late
Cause now I am here
Where heaven and earth cry
Where heaven and earth cry   

Look for the days that I look back on my innocence
My sight was blinded by the same lie
Anything's better than this
My fragile happiness died
It's gone and not coming back
To pick up what little remains of me
From this bad nightmare
I dream that I wake up
My tears are dry, silence echoes
Will this final rhyme
Forget me after a time
Between heaven and hell
