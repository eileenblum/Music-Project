Suffering she bears, yet tender remains
Soul of woman, with wisdom and grace
Willow tree that weeps, sad but not unloved
Cruelest winds of age, 
working their worst where she stands
So much baggage, so much guilt 
and the past seems so distant
I forgot how selfless you brought me life
And into your world
And of all the things I could sing of, 
cannot express what's inside of me
The heart of your son is not so cold
It's never forgotten your love   

Hold on mother earth
Now it's my turn to tend to your needs
Now I comprehend
All the things I hold dear, you gave to me
Hold on mother earth
To see your beautiful face smiling at me
Hold on mother earth
I want to give back your love, 
but I don't know how
Hold on mother earth   

Patiently she waits, just watching the sea
A message in a bottle sailing on the tide
Her weather-beaten face, 
hides her waning faith 
Everything to lose, everything to gain 
Take my hand and feel my love
I will heal your wounds 
and make dry your tears
And of all the things I could sing of,
cannot express what's inside of me...
The heart of your son is not so cold, 
it has not forgotten your love   

Hold on mother earth
Now it's my turn to tend to your needs
Now I comprehend
All the things I hold dear, you gave to me
Hold on mother earth
To see your beautiful face smiling at me
Hold on mother earth
I want to give back your love, 
but I don't know how
Hold on mother earth   

Hold on mother earth
Now it's my turn to tend to your needs
Now I comprehend
All the things I hold dear, you gave to me
Hold on mother earth
To see your beautiful face smiling at me
Hold on mother earth
I want to give back your love, 
Please tell me how
Hold on mother earth   

[ in Arabic, sung by Jbara: ]
Mother Earth, I give you my soul, my love, my respect, my whole life.
You  are life, you are our mother, you are respect.

[ in Portuguese, sung by Andre Matos: ]
Mother Earth that sings and sings, life brings and gives, Mother Earth
that  sings and sings, immortal life and time.
