No passion in his perfect smile
High ratings make salaries start to grow
Face of glass under bright light
Preying on weak minds
The lies he tells
There's no power in them
If you don't listen to the man
You'll never know what's in my head
Or in my soul - it's their goal
You lost your chance, it's not coming back
Just go away and don't come back
Save your fears and lies
All your damage, no more damage   

When I look back I don't understand 
Their obsession to deceive so many people
There's no power in them
If you don't listen to the man   

People listened to your words
And you thought you could tell one more lie 
All we needed was the truth
For peace of mind   

You'll never know what's in my head...   

No more damage, no
