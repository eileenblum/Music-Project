Now
I want to see your eyes
I know my time is over
And
I can't live without your smile
I'll wait until you, you come back again

In this lonely place I'll cry
Waiting for another night

You want to be a lonely girl
I want to be by your side
This world has no sense for me
If you go away
Feeling this heart of fire
Burning inside my soul
My anger is filling me
How could I regain you oh yeah

Feeling
In this heart of mine
Your love, your cries, your kiss to say goodbye
I miss you babe
I miss the way you touch me
Now I want to smile
Now I want to cry, am I crazy?

In this lonely place I'll cry
Waiting for another night

[Solo: Rionda]

In this lonely place I'll cry ooooh ooooh
Waiting for another night

You want to be a lonely girl
I want to be by your side
This world has no sense for me
If you go away
Feeling this heart of fire
Burning inside my soul
My anger is filling me
How could I regain you

You want to be a lonely girl
I want to be by your side
This world has no sense for me
If you go away

Oooooooh ooooooooh
Regain
Regain you
Regain you
