So long so hard, to spend this lonely days
Now in this heart the pain is all the same
In this world my love you know
I can't live if you go away
Please don't leave me, don't leave me
Even if the angels know
The way that I love you they would paint your face
In all my, golden dreams

I know there's no way
There's nothing to say
In this cruel game we lost
All our love is gone
All I want to do is wrong
There's no better way
We're fighting again
In this cruel game we lost
I'll cry for your love before
Before the night (before the night)
Before the night (before the night)
Is gone

I'm crying now, I know it's not the way
Now in this world, I don't want to stay
From your heart my love I saw
The stars and the milky way
Please don't leave me, (don't don't leave me)
Don't leave me (don't don't don't don't leave don't leave)
Even if the angels know
The way that I love you they would paint your face
In all my (don't don't leave me)
Golden dreams (don't don't don't don't leave don't leave don't)

I know there's no way
There's nothing to say
In this cruel game we lost
All our love is gone
All I want to do is wrong
There's no better way
We're fighting again
In this cruel game we lost
I'll cry for your love before
Before the night (before the night)
Before the night (before the night)
Is gone

[Solo: Rionda/Garcia/Rionda]

I don't want to be a lonely man
Now my love I can't understand
This way and this crazy love
I want you for ever more

I know there's no way
There's nothing to say
In this cruel game we lost
All our love is gone
All I want to do is wrong
There's no better way
We're fighting again
In this cruel game we lost
I'll cry for your love before
Before the night (before the night)
Before the night (before the night)
Is gone
