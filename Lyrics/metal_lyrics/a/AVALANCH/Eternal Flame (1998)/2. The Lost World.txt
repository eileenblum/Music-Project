Here we go
Right to the sky
And breaking the silent
To a place
Where I know that we'll live
Without pain and without lies
Without sorrow and without cries

Cause I saw
More people dying that you can imagine
My dream world
Is a long way from here
Through the mountains, through the earth
Through the oceans, through your heart

So many years
Trying to break free
Trying to understand, why?
Fight

Long way from here
Do it without fear
Trying to understand, why?
Fight!

[Solo: Rionda]

Still we go
Right to the sky
And breaking the silent
Take your love
And come with me
To the place where I've been waiting
For the day I'll take your hand

Cause I saw
More people dying that you can imagine
My dream world
Is a long way from here
Through the mountains, through the earth
Through the oceans, through your heart

So many years
Trying to break free
Trying to understand, why?
Fight

Long way from here
Do it without fear
Trying to understand, why?
Fight!
