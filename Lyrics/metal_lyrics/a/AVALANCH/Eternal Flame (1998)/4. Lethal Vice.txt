It's your way, your own decision, walk alone
In your eyes the cruel vision of your inner feelings
There's no time, there's no future, there's no hope
Feel the fire burning

Breaking your illusions
Running through your blood
In your nose
Feel the fire burning

Lethal vice, you are crying without emotions
Lethal vice, you are trying to put in motion
Under the world, forces to rise, forces to smile

You fall again there's no solution, you'll die alone
In your eyes the cruel vision of your poor destiny
Without time, without future, without no hope
Feel the fire burning

Where are your illusions
You will die together
Alone and together
Feel the fire burning

Lethal vice, you are lying without emotions
Lethal vice, you are dying within confussion
Under the world, under all, just for choosing wrong

[Solo: Rionda]

Lethal vice, you are lying without emotions
Lethal vice, you are dying within confussion
Under the world, under all, just for choosing wrong

Lethal vice, you are lying without emotions
Lethal vice, you are dying within confussion
Under the world, under all, just for choosing wrong

Lethal vice
Lethal vice, lethal vice
Under the world, ooooooooh oooh
Lethal vice
Lethal vice
Lethal vice, lethal vice
