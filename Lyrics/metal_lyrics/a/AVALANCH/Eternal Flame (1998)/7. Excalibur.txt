Once upon a legend time
Age of war and darkness days
A lew king wanted to love
His enemy's wife
The price of his lust was his son
The frutage of a passion night
He promised Merlin his loved son
Blinded by desire

God save Camelot's king Excalibur
God save Camelot's king Excalibur

Thousand of haunting knights
Tried to rest this magic sword
Desiring the power of a king
Thousand of haunting knights
Tried to rest this magic sword
Desiring the power of a king

The king knew he had to pay
Not too soon but not too late
And in the dark the duty was
Carried away forever
The king died during the war
Begging Merlin for his son
And on his falling he trusted his sword
Deep inside stone

God save Camelot's king Excalibur
God save Camelot's king Excalibur

Thousand of haunting knights
Tried to rest this magic sword
Desiring the power of a king
Thousand of haunting knights
Tried to rest this magic sword
Desiring the power of a king

[Solo: Rionda]

Thousand of haunting knights
Tried to rest they're magic sword
Desiring the power of a king
Of a king

Thousand of haunting knights
Tried to rest they're magic sword
Power of a king
Thousand of haunting knights
Tried to rest they're magic sword
Desiring the power of a king
In the power of a king
In the power of a king
