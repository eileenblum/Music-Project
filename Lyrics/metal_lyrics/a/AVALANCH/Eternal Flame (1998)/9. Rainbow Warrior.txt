A lonely man is walking
His face is so sad
His future is unknowing
Unknowing his past

It's winter in his heart
He never wants to smile
A sword is hanging hand
He's ready for the fight
A burning chariot's coming
Is coming from the stars
A hundred thousand men
Are fighting hand to hand

He turns his head and watches
The fire from the sky
The vision has no name so
Where is paradise?

He's ready for the fight
He wants to stay alive
He knows that there's no time
No time for judgement day
A great man cries and dies
The fight is crue and tiring
He can't stand sacrifice
But gods got not time

[Solo: Rionda]

The armour of the inmortal warrior lights in the dark
His sword says peace, his hands say give, his eyes never cry
The armour of the inmortal warrior lights in the dark
His sword says peace, his hands say give, the fire from the sky

Dust and rain falls
He prays for rainbow
