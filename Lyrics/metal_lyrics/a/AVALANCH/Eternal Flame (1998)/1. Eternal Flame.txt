Hearing the calling of darkness
Spending my time by your side
I don't want to die
I am looking for
The eternal flame
The flame of life

Now I am walking around the end
I'm only running against time
It's true or false
I'm loosing my control
I'm looking for
The flame of life

An angel tells me that the flame is love
But all the love I have I know it's gone

The reason of our lives
The meaning for your crying days
Now think about your future
You know your life is not a game

The flame of love is around your head
The flame cries sometimes
The flame of happyness

[Solo: Rionda]

Now I am walking around the end
My own enemy is time
It's true or false
I'm loosing my control
I'm looking for
The eternal flame

An angel tells me that the flame is love
But all the love I have I know it's gone

The flame of love is around your head
The flame cries sometimes
The flame of happyness

The flame of life
The flame of life
The flame of life oooh
