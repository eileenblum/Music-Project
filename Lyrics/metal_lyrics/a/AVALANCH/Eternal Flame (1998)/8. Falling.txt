Troubles and pains make your darkness
Cries and screams make you a fool
Your future dreams in this hard way
This things you think, make the rules

Falling
Trying to understand
Falling (you're falling, you're falling, you're falling down)
Is the way to never fall again

Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... if you wanna cry
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... do it tonight
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... learn from the pain
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... to rise again

Falling

Falling (you're falling, you're falling, you're falling down)

Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... if you wanna cry
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... do it tonight
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... learn from the pain
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... to rise again
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... to rise again
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... learn from the pain
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... to rise again
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... troubles and pain make your darkness
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh... make your darkness
Oooh ooooh oooh oooooh...
