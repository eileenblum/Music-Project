?? you the tavern
Everybody talk and laugh
Fall in heaven ?? you the tavern
Everybody talk and laugh
Fall in heaven

Why can not you allow
Why do you resist this load
Did you lose your common sense

Why do you feel your throat
Thirsty it wants to go
To drink some beer with your friends

Maybe the tavern is for you your own home
Perhaps there stay with your friends
Perhaps there the hours pass slow
Maybe you want to live there

Screaming in your home
Your daughter and your son
Playing and screaming everyday
Your mother says no!
Your brain says go!
And your friends and you don't understand

Maybe the tavern is for you your own home
Perhaps there stay with your friends
Perhaps there the hours pass slow
Maybe you want to live there

Everybody in the tavern
Talk and laugh cause we haven't
Any problems just one question about our destiny
Perhaps to be or not to be drinking another beer
Perhaps someone or another one the answer is near

Questions in my mind
Past in your hand
Present in your heart
Future let me rest

[Solo: Rionda]

Questions in my mind
Past in your hand
Present in your heart
Future let me rest
Let me rest
Let me rest
