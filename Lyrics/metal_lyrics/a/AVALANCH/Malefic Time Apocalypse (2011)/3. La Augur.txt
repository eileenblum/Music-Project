I'm falling,
I feel lost,
I have no place to go.

They're coming,
They look for me.
I'm walking through the dark.

Wake up, wake up,
Nothing's quite as it seems.
Wake up, wake up,
This is enough for me.
Wake up, wake up,
I live through the lies
Wake up, wake up,
time is on their side.

Need you to call my name,
Guide me before I wake.
Dust to dust, fade to black.
Wake me up before I dream again.
I feel so sad...

I'm walking,
I feel lost.
What are we fighting for?

If this is a dream coming true,
Why I feel so sad?

Wake up, wake up,
I feel like dust in the wind
Wake up, wake up,
I need someone who seals my dreams.
Wake up, wake up,
You want to run away.
Wake up, wake up,
There is no place to hide.

Need you to call my name,
Guide me before I wake.
Dust to dust, fade to black.
Wake me up before I dream again.
I feel so sad...

Need you to call my name,
Guide me before I wake.
Dust to dust, fade to black.
Wake me up before I dream again.
I feel so sad...
