I need you by my side
I can't take anymore
That time i'ts for long
I can't wait to see you again

I have "whole and missed" faith
I climbed mountains higher than the sun
but now...

I GET DOWN ON MY KNEES AND PRAY FOR LOVE
DON'T WAIT FOR ME, I HAVE TO GO
AND I CAN'T GO ON
WITHOUT YOU SOUL
I PRAY FOR LOVE...FOR LOVE!

For the rest of my days I will not lost
I'm not afraid 'cause I'm the lord
places never seen before
mountains higher than the sun
but never...I pryed for love

I GET DOWN ON MY KNEES AND PRAY FOR LOVE
DON'T WAIT FOR ME, I HAVE TO GO
AND I CAN'T GO ON
WITHOUT YOU SOUL
I PRAY FOR LOVE...FOR LOVE!
