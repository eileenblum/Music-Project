Just mind the shadows I got in you.
So tell me now what youâre gonna do.
Tell me, too worries? youâre smooth.
Tell me why death is right in front of you.

Little girl of silver hair,
Donât you worry, Iâll be there.
Dry your bloody tears, donât cry,
Time to run 

Itâs time to fight,
Itâs no time to cry.
Itâs time to hide from the light,
Hide from the sun.

Learning to walk again,
Learning to love again,
Learning to die.
Itâs malefic time.

Face the truth, now you are alone.
So watch your steps and carry on.
Give them your best shots,
Donât have to run.
Give them your best shots,
Now itâs your turn!

Itâs time to hide from the light,

Learning to die.
Itâs malefic time.
