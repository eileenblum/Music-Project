I wait for the morning sun,
Wait for the life and sunlight.
No one can hold me now,
And I don't care.
I walk alone.

I wait for the little girl,
Who was my heart,
And now that everything is so hard,
To walk on your own,
Now you walk alone.

I know a place
Where the moon and the sun will shine,
Will shine again.

Pain is the way to learn,
The way to live and die, but
I'm not ready for that,
We'll carry on,
I can show you how to fly.

This is the place
Where you could be a star shining in the dark.
You are the one who holds the key.

No, I don't need no preacher to show me the way.
No, I don't need no lessons to walk on my own
No, I don't need anyone to show my power.
No, I'm a fighter, I'm a pirate, I'm your master.
No!

The dark side of the moon,
Is not much better than the dark side of the sun.
I know i'ts so hard, to walk on your own.

I know a place,
Where the moon and the sun will shine,
Will shine again.

No, I don't need no preacher to show me the way.
No, I don't no lessons to walk on my own.
No, I don't need anyone to show my power.
No, I'm a fighter, I'm a pirate, I'm your master.
Now you give me, blood on blood.

Now you... Now you give,
Now you give me,
Now you give me blood,
Now you give me blood on blood!

No, I don't need no preacher to show me way.
No, I don't no lessons to walk on my own.
No, I don't need anyone to show my power.
No, I'm a fighter, I'm your master.
Now you give me, blood on blood.
