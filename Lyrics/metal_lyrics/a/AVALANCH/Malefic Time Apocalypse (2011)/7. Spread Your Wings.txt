Come to the right side,
Come to the promised land.
No more tears to try,
No more sacrifice.

Look for eternity,
Look at sorrow,
No more tears to cry,
No more place to hide.

Now spread your wings,
You can be more than this.
Leave behind your fears,
Just know the ocean is deeper than its sands.

Come to the end of your life,
Com with your head high.
No more tears to try,
No more sacrifice.

Look for reality,
Look at sorrow,
No more tears to cry,
No more place to hide.

Now spread your wings,
You can be more than this.
Leave behind your fears,
Just know the ocean is deeper than its sands.

Your where born under a bad sin,
Who can you owe of this way?
I'll take you to any place.
Anywhere, anywhere you want to go.

Now spread your wings,
You can be more than this.
Leave behind your fears,
Just know the ocean is deeper than its sands.
