Hey, here I am again
Watching life, pass by
A fear, with me breed the end
Of this lonely heart...
Hey, here I am tonight
Watching your love, pass by
A fear, there is no time
Decides of matter...
And in another day
With you by my side
In your eyes... in your arms...
Take me, to where the river flows
And drift away with me...
Wow, take me, to where the wind blows
And fly with me.

Hey, here I am tonight
I won't let your love, pass me by
If you, give me little time
I'll win back your heart...
And see another day
I'll be by your side
In your arms... in your arms...
Take me, to where the river flows
And drift away with me...
Wow, take me, to where the wind blows
And fly with me.
