The hate invades my eyes
Can't relate, or vindicate
I'm too blind
You said you'll end this
But you transcend it protected
You promised but you lied
Too late can't change my fate
Choked intoxicated with every word
You said infected rejected
Purely corrupted you promised
But again you lied

Creeping inside my veins
Pacifies me in extra does of pain
I can't contain it
Living your world and endure your
Hate
Discrimination
Lies
Violation
Enslave
Generations
We must end this right now

I bleed inside my head
I died but still undead
Sunk so deep and I can't float
Submerged in the world of the unknown

Creeping inside my veins
Pacifies me in extra does of pain
I can't contain it
Living your world and endure your
Hate
Discrimination
Lies
Violation
Enslave
Generations
We must end this right now
