Change of evolution
Sick joy of demolition
Massacre a generation
And the death bell still rings on
They want to kill the rest of the youth
They think we're weak
but we are much stronger
They start the war and we pay the dues
No we won't fight any longer

[Chorus:]
Dreams of change Ooh
Evolution
It's a sick joy Ooh
Demolition
A demolition

They've got the power to control my fate
I'd rather die than disintegrate
And I will fight until the end of this
Just set me free and let me breathe

One step to the victory
One step to the death

[Solo]

My child is crying
My child is starving
His mother's heart inside is burning
They stole my land
They stole my home
They ripped my flesh
They stripped my bones

Dreams of change Oooh
Evolution
It's a sick joy Oooh
Demolition
