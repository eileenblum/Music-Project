The life you reaped
Once had a name
The blood stains your hands
Wrapped in guilt sealed with shame
I grieve for what turns to ashes
And bones and buried beneath the
Garden of stones
When the night is dawn
And the haze ruled the sky
The death marched through the land
I heard the angels cry
I crave what's mine back
All that I have known
Now buried beneath
The garden of stones
