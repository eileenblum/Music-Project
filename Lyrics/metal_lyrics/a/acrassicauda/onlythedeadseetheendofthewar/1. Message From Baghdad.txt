As I grew bounded to my fate
Rewinding the wounded memories I gained
So weak I can hardly breathe
So sick of their lies, tired of deceit

Is god's will or just a lie
People live and others die
Never had the chance and they never will
Forever doomed as I wonder why

Dead bodies walking coffins
Caged souls locked in prisons
They might forget, but still unforgiving
Fearless zombies walk among the living

Is god's will or just a lie
People live and others die
Never had the chance and they never will
Forever doomed as I wonder why
