I feel Iâm reaching a crisis
A prisoner and a slave of lust
Drinking evil out of a chalice
A voice keeps telling me I must

They canât see my awful face
So Iâm discovering a new pleasure
That of a sin wrapped in lace
Which bans any leisure

A place of relief for lovers
Whom I watch through the mirror
Tasting orgy and all sorts of fevers
They all will be mine forever

Behind the mirror â Iâm slave to fantasy
Behind the mirror â everything seems so easy
