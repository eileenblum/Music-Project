On sole faraway Scottish road
Strangeness is hanging over
An old coach man drives his load
Under threatening thunder
His passengerâs no one but the baron
With a mysterious past
His name is famous across the region
He will be the last

No oneâs ever laid him to
Rest for eternity

Sign of the time
Return and forgiveness
Sign of the time
Too many facts, too many lies

His castleâs become the prison
Of wonderful creatures
He honours them beyond reason
Regardless of these tortures
Cause this new worlds isnât that brave
The man holds them responsible
For violating his own grave
And Thus showing their mettle

On some faraway Scottish road
Strangeness is hanging over

Down in the plains where he once abode
This rage is growing stronger
