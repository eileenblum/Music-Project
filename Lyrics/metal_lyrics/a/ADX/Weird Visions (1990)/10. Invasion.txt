Beyond the sky and in the outer space
A galaxy is dying from an alien pain
Fleshy beings with strange and ugly faces
Have decided to invade our world of gain

Their shuttles seem to come out
Of some bad dream
And our cities are destroyed
By a huge laser beam
Spitting fire on life and on the whole planet
Theyâve come from nowhere
To devour us bit by bit

Theyâre running wild in the streets to escape
From a curse thatâs gonna shape our fate

March against invasion
The earth is imperiled
Fight against invasion
Dâday has arrived
