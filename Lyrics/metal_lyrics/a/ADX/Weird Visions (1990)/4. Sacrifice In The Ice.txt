Who are those men
Wearing a mask and dressed in white
Iâm chained up in the twilight

No memories
But where the hellâs my past gone
Yeah, whatâs going on

Visions 
Nightmare
I want sincerity
Anguish
Madness
Dream or reality

No more joy
No more pleasures
No more desires
I just canât break the ice

In this room
The walls are cold and lifeless
They sure will be merciless

Iâm being touched
Being watched in that prison
Iâm praying for my reason

My bodyâs tense
With pain and steel
And my wounds wonât heal

I got no more blood
My heart beats like an engine
Iâm like a machine
