Telling the future for eternity
Now the evil is prowling
I make omens become reality
You'll be laughing or suffering

Like a stranger staring into the distance
You refuse to trust me
In your eyes I can see impatience

So just let it be

[Chorus:]
Believe
Time holds no secret for me
Believe
Fortunetelling

The truth has been told and the dice cast
By death we might be attacked
All the prayer shall never make last
The moment of the final act
