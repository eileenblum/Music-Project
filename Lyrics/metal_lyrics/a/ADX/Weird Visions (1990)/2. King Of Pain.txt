Land of demons or land of beasts
This place is nothing but a vast furnace
Wild with victories and bloody feasts
You stand alone in your madness

Stop always shedding the enemyâs blood
Forget those people dragged your name
In the mud

Hands are held out in the silence
All these corpses lying at your feet
Your eyes sparkle with intolerance
Of a glory gained by some feat

Stop always shedding the enemyâs blood
Forget those people dragged your name
In the mud
Stop always shedding the enemyâs blood
Forget they all prayed for the flood

Why sowing death, why using chains
Your very pride destroyed a whole country
No one shall question your actions
Hell swallowed them up for eternity
