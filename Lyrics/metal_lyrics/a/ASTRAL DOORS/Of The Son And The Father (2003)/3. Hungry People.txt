They are the hungry children, dying before our eyes
I dry their frozen tears, I won't let them down

Ten thousand screaming out
Calling out my name

[Chorus:]
We cry: we cry for the children of mankind
We cry: we cry for the nature that we found
The hungry people

The world is moving faster, spinning round and round
We're bound to meet disaster, high above the ground

Which one is innocent?
Of the greed we share

All my nights, I could hear their cries for life
I'm a loser: I am no one I am praying down the line

[Solo]

It's hard to pray for someone and to justify
I dry their frozen tears and I won't let them down

Ten thousand screaming out
Calling out your name
