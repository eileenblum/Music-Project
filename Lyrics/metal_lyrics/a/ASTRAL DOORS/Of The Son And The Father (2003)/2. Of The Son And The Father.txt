We look upon the man of twilight
Forever damned to holy ground
Behind the walls it's black, but evil shines
And none can leave until it's done

Strangers in our eyes
They walk in shaped of God
Hear me now, cast away your pride

[Chorus:]
Be wise, hear the unholy rime
Loud and clear of the Son and the Father
Inside the sanctum of crime  be wise
In the name of the Father he lies

The momentary act of treason
Against the sacred calf he found
Sent off the biggest rock, to roll the world
And I won't stop until it's done

Stranger in your eyes
They walk in shapes of God
Hear me now, cast away your pride
