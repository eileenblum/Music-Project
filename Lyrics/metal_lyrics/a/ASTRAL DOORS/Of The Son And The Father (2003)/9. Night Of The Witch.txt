What's another broken bone?
Another life to spill
There's lady in black who feeds the darkness,
High up on the hill

Burn her: stone her
They know what not to do
Kill her: take her
She's crying over you

[Chorus:]
She'll burn alive for the people with no souls
Who doesn't try
She's burning alive
Do they cry?
When they realized they never asked her why
She's burning
She's burning alive

Caught inside this evil dream,
With this vicious love machine
Sucking life from our senses,
It's a game that just can't win

Stab her: Rob her
Her time is running out
Ban her: Break her
She's crying in the night

[Chorus]
