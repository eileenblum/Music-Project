Facing the world with polluted eyes
Diving to see who I am!
Falling from grace now oblivion
Sail out: fade out

[Chorus:]
My bleeding eyes, only blind men
You're a serpentine: minds game: fools game

Behind the walls from the gospel
The field of gold, must be lost here
As I am deeper than down
Lead me to embrace, or I will die
Climbing to God in a desperate way
Longing the day when I die
Biding my time in the Trojan horse
Some day, some way

[Chorus:]
In the burning sun: only blind men
What is to be won? Minds games fools game

A light ablaze in the open
The ghouls of pain are awoken
But I will follow the road
Away from Babylon, or I will die

Raising my voice for wooden majer
Breaking my back for the master taker
Running along through the flood of life
Locked in a horse, but you can't hold me out

Working my time in the mortal chamber
Surrounded by walls of amber
Rushing along, though the system failed
This Trojan horse is mine, I can not be
