Don't come out of your bunker
It's your dungeon,and your hell
Chasing the rainbow you searched all your life
The cradle of time, no one to sanctify

Arabian nights, the oriental ways
But still they shine on

[Chorus:]
Freedom's not found on the trail out of tears
And no one should live as a slave
You can not fight 'gainst your deepest of fears
It's written by nature of man
In the ocean of sand

Now you say you're Messiah,
None can just were you dwell
Searching the mountain, they seek underground
Hate are forever and traitors must die

Arabian nights, nomad affairs
True believers

[Chorus]
