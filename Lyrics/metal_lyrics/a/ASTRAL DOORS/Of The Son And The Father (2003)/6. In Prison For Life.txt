In prison for life, the price to pay
For holding the knife, that gruesome day
In prison for life, I live to die
I'm in prison, in prison for life

Facing Armageddon
Violent revelation
Why? Can't someone tell me how?
Be merciful and mild
It's terminal, there's no way back

I'm on the run, the run now, babe
Can't you see that if true

Well, I'm in prison for life, I had to pay
For holding the knife, that gruesome day
In prison for life, I live to die
Lost all my rights
I'm in prison, in prison for life

Come here, humanizer
Blue sky, new horizons
I was crawling, I was drained
Sent shockwaves through my brain
Eternal dark, forever lost

And oh, I'm slipping away, away now babe
Now, can't you see it's true

I'm standing alone, alone now, babe
So let me die in piece

'cause I'm in prison for life, the price to pay
For holding the knife, that gruesome day
In prison for life, I live to die
Lost all my rights
I'm in prison, in prison for life
