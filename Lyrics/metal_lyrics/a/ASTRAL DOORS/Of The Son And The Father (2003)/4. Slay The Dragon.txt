Way gone 'bout a thousand years
Ancient Lullaby
Kings and Queens and evil scenes
Darkness filled their minds
Fury and rage from the sky
How could they live just to die

[Chorus:]
Slay the dragon: kill the beast
Power knight of heavenly might
Slay the Dragon: join the feast
It's not human, save us now
We all know that you're divine

Brave Saint John Stood all alone
Offspring sent from Hell
Brimstone, fire, smoke and cries
In this medieval tale

Armoured by God he came to ride
Blessed with a sword to save the bride

[Chorus:]
Slay the Dragon: kill the Beast
Power knight prepared to fight
Slay the Dragon: join the feast
It's not human, save us now
We all know that you're divine
