We've been running out of time
You've been eating up our minds
But we always try to get a little higher
You've been told of in the tale
How you heal what we create
Like a fool in the sea of desire

No freedom, no pride, no joy
We must rife: burn the ice

[Chorus:]
Left to genocide
Bit the cloudbreaker's coming to find
Searching a sign from the rimes
The cloudbreaker's always around
Watching the world from the sky

Someone said life is a game
It's like pleasure versus pain
Open up your eyes and see the world in daylight
Cause they laugh at human race
And they spit you in your face
Realize they're only prophet's in a world of lies

They rule in the name of God:
Bring 'em down, melt their crown
