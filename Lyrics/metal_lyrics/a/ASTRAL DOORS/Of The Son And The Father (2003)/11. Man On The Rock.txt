If there's a sweet heart-breaker
You'd really try to make her
You're a loaded son of a gun
If your ground is shaking
And everyone is quaking
I will never, never, never be the one to run

Rock 'n' roll was made for children
For the kids in the heat of the night
In Rock we trust, you'll never stand alone

'Cause I'm the man on the rock
Man on the rock
Like Jesus Christ
Man on the rock
Yes, I am
Man on the rock

If you come up to my mountain to visit the apostle
You'll be king though just for a day
And there'll be music playing
While everyone is praying
And I will never be the one to let you down

Rock 'n' roll was made for children
For the kids in the heat of the night
The astral cries, like echoes in the night

'Cause I'm the man on the rock
Man on the rock
Like Jesus Christ
Man on the rock
Yes, I am
Man on the rock
Man on the rock

Man on the rock
Man on the rock
Man on the rock
Man on the rock

Rock 'n' roll was made for children
For the kids in the heat of the night
In Rock we trust, you'll never stand alone

'Cause I'm the man on the rock
Man on the rock
Like Jesus Christ
Man on the rock
Come on all
Man on the rock

'Cause I'm the man on the rock
I am the man on the
Man on the rock
Like Jesus Christ
Man on the rock
I'm the man on the rock
Man on the rock
