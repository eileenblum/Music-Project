âThe king is dead; long live the kingâ

Showdown: someone mustfall and they know it
Wake up: the king must be dead
Guess he blew it; they all knew it

Send them an angel that can fly

[Chorus:]
Through the wind and rain, an endless search
For the gates light
By the cosmic altar and the spirits in white
In the dark of the night; embrace a glory night
Behind the gates of light

Stone tower; a victim of power
There was silence
Outside; a masquerade ball
Tried to hide it; they were blinded

Black hole of sorrow dressed in white

[Chorus]

In the cold of universe
At the scene of lies
A new millennium, one more fight
Revolution will unite

[Lead: J. Nordlund]
[Lead: M. Haglund]

Showdown: someone mustfall
And they knew it
Wake up; the king must be dead
Guess he blew it; then you ruined it

Black hole of sorrow dressed in white

[Chorus]

Come and join us while we're feasting on your flesh
We are the warriors let it be the final test
Now mother earth is here about to spread her legs
The new millennium revolution is about to crack
Behind the gates of light
Behind the gates of light
