Here I am

And the band played on
While the world was falling to pieces
It's getting dark you see
If you need light just let me know

Mr. President
We don't need your stupid lies
Making history there
I'm telling you time is now

[Chorus:]
Cold War Survivor, bless your heart
Tell you story one more time
Cold War Survivor, You are the teacher now
Teach me more, teach me more

The parades at the Red square
Under threat everyone is smiling
From the divided states
Illegal movements underground

Mr. President
No forgiveness, no regret
Changing history there again
The time is now

[Chorus]

Teach me more about the cold war

I'm entertained
Am I still sane?
I'm of a breed that you will never ever tame
I know for sure, I just ignore
All the crap thrown in my face

[Lead: M. Haglund]
[Lead: J. Nordlund]

Mr. President
We don't need your stupid lies
Making history there
You know the people said stop

[Chorus]

I'm entertained
Am I still sane?
I'm of a breed that you will never ever tame
I know for sure, I just ignore
All the crap thrown in my face
I'm the survivor
