Quisling; a notorious liar
Quisling; all must die now
Quisling; a sick desire, undertaker
Creating pandemonium turbulence
No defence, deliverance
The engine of the war machine
Is breaking down

There are people on the streets
Laughing and out of control
Let the good times roll

[Chorus:]
Never say never again
From Hell and back again
A bloody hole inside our soul
That greedy hound was out
Never say never again
From Hell and back again
The raping of a beaten land
Corrupted friends gave him the orders

Traitor; a threat to the nation
Traitor; time to leave now
Traitor; a false commander dragged us under
Heavy water, by the shores of the Northern Sea
A black ordeal in history
Dressed for a Viking funeral
Discovered; dishonour

You will lose, I'm gonna win
âCause Quislings are destined to fail
And they are all for sale

[Chorus]

âThere ever was no master plan
Into darkness you're condemned
Pleasant stay in eternity's torture
âCause in Hell everyone's immortalâ

They were dancing on your grave
Laughing and out of control
Let the good times roll
Never say never

Quisling; notorious liar
Quisling; time to leave now
Quisling; a sick desire
Never
Never say never again

[Chorus]
