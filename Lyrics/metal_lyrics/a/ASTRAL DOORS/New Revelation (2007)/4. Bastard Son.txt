When you were young
A fugitive always on the run
Washing your hands in blood
Looking for the danger
Sleeping with a fallen angel; stranger
Open up your arms and don't ever let me go

[Chorus:]
Hold me, hold me
All the tears in my eyes are real
You are the only one
Won't you tell me how it feels to live a lie?
Save me, save me
I'm bastard son
And I'll never let you go

The days are my nights
Your shadow will always be around
Keep me from the gun
What's your contribution?
Life is just a grand illusion; dreaming
Don't wake me up
There's so much for me to lose

[Chorus:]
Hold me, hold me
All the tears in my eyes are real
You are the only one
Won't you tell me how it feels to live a lie?
Save me, save me
I'm bastard son
And now I'm coming home

Did you try to do the right
Did you put up a fight for your own child?
I was born to this world and I won't live forever

[Lead: J. Nordlund]

[Chorus]

Bastard son
I'm the bastard son and now I'm coming home
I'm the bastard son
