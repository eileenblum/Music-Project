Beggar, begging for life
Squeezing the last from he past
Bleed for the earth
For the silent rebirth
Forever may end all too fast

But why would anyone care?
Please let me go; it's only a dream

[Chorus:]
Back to earth, or a one way ticket leading to the sun?
The mouth of Hell is open
The mother ship's calling and calling
Planet Earth

Travel you pilgrims of Mars
Take us beyond the unknown
Bring us the answer we've yearned for so long
The war of existence is on

But why exploring the worlds
And open doors without knowing what's there

[Chorus]

5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Lead: M. Haglund]
[Lead: J. Nordlund]

Oh beggar, begging for time
Squeezing the last from the past
Bleed for the earth, for the silent rebirth
Forever may end all too fast

But why would anyone care?
Please let me go; it's only a dream

[Chorus]
