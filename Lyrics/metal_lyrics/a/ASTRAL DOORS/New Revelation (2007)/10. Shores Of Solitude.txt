âBefore the age of seventeenâ

Am I a man or a machine?
Should I stay or should I turn around?
You know that in a world full of hate
Now the anger is my date
Sweet, sweet violence is my drug

[Chorus:]
Hailing from the outworld
A shadow with a broken soul
Like a castaway on the shores of solitude
Solitude

âI'm lost in my rageâ

Am I a blind man with a gun?
A desperado a windmill warrior
But I've been misunderstood
I'm the black sheep of the hood
Had to crack the house of glass

[Chorus:]
Hailing from the outworld
A runner with a broken bone
Like a castaway at the shores of solitude

I'm not a man, or a machine
Pure rage keeps my conscience cleaned

[Lead: M. Haglund]
[Lead: J. Nordlund]

In a world full of hate
Now the anger is my date
Sweet, sweet violence is my drug

[Chorus]

I'm a castaway
Again and again
On the shores of solitude
