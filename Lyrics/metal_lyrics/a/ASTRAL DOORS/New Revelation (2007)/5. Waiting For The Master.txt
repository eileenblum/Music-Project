I am the beast, I'm the midnight wanderer
I am the ghost of the daytime conqueror
I am a slave to the game
So don't say, say I'm wrong

They are children of the valley
Hidden village near the lake
I saw the forest people gather
For the final take

Slay and I'm gonna slay
Kill and I'm gonna kill
I'm waiting

[Chorus:]
Waiting for the master to call
Here under the shadow of the father
Waiting for the master to call
To command me, I'll go where he sends me
I'm waiting for the master to call
Waiting for the master to call

Under the moon, sleeping under open sky
Breathing the air so clean, I'm well and dry
Tomorrow; too late
Every step I take is for you

So foretell about the secret
Made by ancient kings and queens
About the sorcerers and castles
Black magic night

Speak and I'm gonna speak
Die and I'm gonna die
I'm waiting

[Chorus]

I'm waiting for the master to give me a sign
Speak the word
Show me yourself
I know you deceived me
Time to free me... again

[Lead: J. Nordlund]
[Lead: M. Haglund]

Slay and I'm gonna slay
Die and I'm gonna die
I'm waiting; waiting for the master to call

[Chorus]

I'm waiting for the master to give me a sign
Speak the word
Show me yourself
I know you deceived me
Time to feel me again

Waiting for the master to call

I am the beast, I'm the midnight wanderer
I am the ghost of the daytime conqueror
I am a slave to the game
I'm waiting for the master
