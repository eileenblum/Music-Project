On through the night we march
Heavy load upon our heathen hearts
The war goes on and on and on
My nights are cold and I'll always wait for the changer of days
Holy man, it's not too late

[Chorus:]
We're gonna shine like the morning star, forever and ever
âCause we were chosen to fight in the freedom war
So carry on, carry on

Now I sit here in loneliness
Long ago I fought the civil war
I feel it's the point of no return
The time is now but I stand alone with the voices inside
General, I wonder why

[Chorus]

[Lead: J. Nordlund]

On through the night we march
Heavy load upon our heathen hearts
The war goes on and on and on
My nights are cold and I'd like to sleep for the rest of my days
A Judas kiss and then farewell

[Chorus]
