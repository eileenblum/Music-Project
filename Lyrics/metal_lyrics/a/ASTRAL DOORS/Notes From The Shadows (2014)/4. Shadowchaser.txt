There is crossroad between heaven and hell
So many play us that song
And it's easy now drifting away
But you'll end up like all the rest
As a shadow chaser

Life is an endless fight
Nailed to the cross tonight
The mark of the devil is pierced into your skin
Let the madness begin

This fury and anger, just let it all out
A new kind of virus is here
Insulted people don't know what is right
And no one seems to care
But you see them everywhere
I spit on your name

You're a shadow chaser
With a twisted mind
You're a shadow chaser; live and let die
In a different world at another place
On a different lane you could stop the chase

Stepping across the line
Every single time
The forces of evil has captured your soul
So let the bad times roll

Extremely determined to do what it takes
Power is sweeter than love
You take what you want, you smash and grab
No one gets the point; you're a soldier at the front

You're a shadow chaser
With a twisted mind
You're a shadow chaser; live and let die
In a different world at another place
On a different lane you could stop the chase

Shadow chaser
Shadow chaser

This fury and and anger, just let it all out
A new kind of virus is here
Insulted people don't know what is right
And no one seems to care
But you see them everywhere
I spit on your name

You better face it
You're a shadow chaser
You're hunting high and low
Don't wanna miss the show
When they play the final game

You're a shadow chaser
With a twisted mind
You're a shadow chaser; live and let die
In a different world at another place
On a different lane you could stop the chase
