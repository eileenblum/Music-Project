I've spent my life in oh, so many ways
It's time to tell my story
Hungry people; in prison for life
Of the son and the father we cry

Praising the bones
Riding the flame
Be wise easy rider
Bride of Christ
Babylon rise
Evil spirits will fly

You know one life can be pleasure and pain
The green mile's been walked but we'd do it again
Cry out tonight as loud as you can
But here are my confessions again

We've seen the world, we've played on every stage
In rock we trust forever
In the London Caves to fight the freedom war
Power and glory but we still wanted more

It's the seventh crusade
To the ocean of sand
Cold war survivor: let's do it again
Bastard son
The rider will come
So you must carry on

You know one life can be pleasure and pain
The green mile's been walked but we'd do it again
Cry out tonight as loud as you can
But here are my confessions again

Is it only a game?
Confessions again
Have I been dreaming?
So wake me up

Let's burn down the wheel
And pull the brake
The call of the wild child
Fire in the house
Breaker of clouds
No black rain tonight

You know one life can be pleasure and pain
The green mile's been walked but we'd do it again
Cry out tonight as loud as you can
But here are my confessions again
