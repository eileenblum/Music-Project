Reading from the black book
Suicidal remedy
Travel to the end of time
A stranger in us all

Raw ride through raging storms and thunder
Cast away the spirit going under
These words will lead to the lonely shadows

'Cause he's a man on a wire
Balancing on the Wailing Wall
Glory for hire; it's all in your mind
Soon the night will fall at the Wailing Wall

Talking to the demons
Conversation overload
Treason of humanity
These chains will never break

Black thoughts; no expectations
Empty souls in all sleeping nations
This path will lead us into forever

For a thousand years and more this will go on
It will haunt you and haunt me
Oh baby

Raw ride through raging storms and thunder
Cast away the spirit going under
These words will lead to the lonely shadows

For a thousand years and more this will go on
