Louisiana rendezvous
We keep traditions alive
Mississippi passing through
Crossroad tell me where I will go this time

Black cat bones
Inside this body you're never alone
Enchanted stones
Spirits gather; stronger together

People do believe a skeleton key
Is hidden in the mind
Hoodoo ceremony the knowledge is free
So use it while you can

They're on the bayou to write
The book of black magic might
And southern conjuration
They have no right
To open Pandora's box
And let the wicked things out

This is a witchcraft enterprise
To take your honor away
They are the children of the swamp
Led by the powers of the mojo bag

Conjuring Queen
Inside this brain you never will see
Revenge is sweet
We ain't gonna take it, get ready to break it

Brought by the slaves
To America's states
A wise man said: they won't forget

They're on the bayou to write
The book of black magic might

Superstitious man
Run while you can
A wise man said: you're already dead
