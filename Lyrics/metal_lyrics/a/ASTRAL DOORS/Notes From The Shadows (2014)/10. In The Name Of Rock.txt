I saw the writings on the wall right before my eyes
Came out as soon I heard the call; reached for the sky
Walked down the lane of make believe in the pouring rain
I'm too clever, forever I will rule this kingdom of pain

Just a boy with the fist held high
Long hair, mama cried
I had power to blow them all away

In the name of rock
I'll fight forever
In the name of rock
I've sworn the oath tonight, unite
In the name of rock

Stray cat, living on the street, but the strong will rise
Black dog; dirt under my feet; a lord in disguise
This is the story of my life, this is all for real
Wild attraction, a slave under the knife, addicted to steel

But the music found my way
Made me what I am today
There's a God and now I see the light

In the name of rock
I'll fight forever
In the name of rock
I've sworn the oath tonight, unite
In the name of rock

In the name of rock
In the name of rock
In the name of rock
In the name of rock

Just a boy with the fist held high
Long hair, mama cried
I had power to blow them all away

In the name of rock
I'll fight forever
In the name of rock
I've sworn the oath tonight, unite
In the name of rock
