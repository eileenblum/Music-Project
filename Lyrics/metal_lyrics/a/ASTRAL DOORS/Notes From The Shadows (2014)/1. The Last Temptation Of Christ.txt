He carried the cross; man upon his shoulder
Whatever they say there was love to be found
Mary Magdalene; you are desire
Talk to me again I don't want to forget
A serpent of lies or the last temptation of Christ
Last temptation of Christ
He will rise

He's the washer of sins, a painter of the future
Surrender to God to find eternal light
Judas Iscariot; the kiss of a traitor
Trick me again and I'll make you forget
Hear Lucifer's cry for the last temptation of Christ

Crucified; still alive
What have they done?
Last temptation of Christ

The Messiah or not; the day is getting closer
And the end of the world is not that far away
Virgin Mary said: the dream is broken
Save me once again from the Devil inside
A serpent of lies or the last temptation of Christ

Crucified; still alive
What have they done
Last temptation Of Christ
Crucified; still alive
What have they done
Is he the son of God?
