Walker the stalker the fundamental spy
Loving you to death though you are eager not to die
Walker the stalker breathing down your neck
Your guardian in the dead of night

Play out the player
There are many roads to cross
If there's a reason to doubt just let it all out
Pay the costs

You'd better lock the door, they're coming for more
Here is the night never turn off the light
If someone knocks on the door, you know it for sure
This nightmare is closer than ever

Peter the cheater surfing on your fear
Insulting your name when he thinks that no one hears
Walker the stalker the emperor of pain
Standing at the end of fights

Take out the taker
Don't ever close your eyes
There is a lesson to learn or bodies will burn
So hold your ground

You'd better lock the door, they're coming for more
Here is the night never turn off the light
If someone knocks on the door, you know it for sure
This nightmare is closer than ever
