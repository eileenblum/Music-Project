Here are my notes from the shadows
Don't want to show them to you
Here are my notes from the darkness
Believe me it's true

In the dungeons of fire
In the chambers of misery
Permanent pain forever
Oh my God; what have they done?

Lived their lives in the fast lane
All obsessed by desire and gold
But everyone must pay the prize
It's no merciful fate, it's a circle of hate

Known as the fallen angel
See it from a different angle
He's the king of war and lies
But aren't we all

Disciples of the dragon lord
Disciples of the dragon lord
We are disciples of the dragon lord
The maker of evil

This is not another nightmare or fairytale
We're all disciples of the dragon lord
Disciples of the dragon lord
You're trying to recall
Crawling out of Hell though from heaven sent
We're all disciples of the dragon lord

There is blood on the altar
It's a twisted reality
Prophets of black illusions
Now enslaved by the one

Ice, flames and hailstones
Tortured minds, bodies and souls
Eternity is here and now
He's the son of a whore; he's the servant to call

Sinners need a savior
But then you will owe him a favour
The ocean is raging wild
Here we are

Disciples of the dragon lord
Disciples of the dragon lord
Some heads are gonna roll
We are disciples of the dragon lord
Disciples of the dragon lord

You know there's no mountain of freedom
The chains will never break
At the dragon's den
It's stronger than steel

Donât you know that he's known as the fallen angel
Now see it from a different angle
The king of war and lies

Arenât we all Disciples of the dragon lord
Some heads gonna roll
Disciples of the dragon lord
We're all disciples of the dragon lord
You're trying to recall
Crawling out of Hell though from heaven sent
We are disciples of the dragon

In the dungeons of fire; in the chambers of mystery
Permanent pain forever
Oh dragon lord; I raise my cup
Obsessed by desire, what have we done?
Turning the sun into fire
I try to escape; trying to see it all

I'm waiting for the dragon lord
