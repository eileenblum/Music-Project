I feel I'm falling like the autumn leaves
I know the only way is down
But I've always known I'll die alone

Pilgrim; what's the story of your lonely life?
I believe that you had other plans but now it's getting clearer
So tell me father; what did you find in the holy land?
There is evil in the tales of the Lord and the Holy Ghost
True Sacrifice

Why do people fear the reaper?
The reaper is the light
No confessions will save me now

I'll die alone
I'll die alone
In solitude I pray to the man on the golden throne
I'll die alone
Carve my name into the stone

Teacher; can you tell me 'bout your misery
In the maze of all this lunacy; religion and confusion
Man is no fortress; in the realms they say eternity
Is the prize to win; just follow the words all the wise men wrote
No Sacrifice

How could I deny the maker?
The maker is the light
No projection; save me now

I'll die alone
I'll die alone
In solitude I pray to the man on the golden throne
I'll die alone
Carve my name into the stone

A prison for the thousand souls of anger
Requiem of the entire human race

Burning brave ambitions; the dragon's on a mission
With human dreams and thoughts of what is right

In my life I was a loner
And I died in solitude
A golden bridge to heaven
For the misunderstood

I feel I'm falling like the autumn leaves
I know the only way is down
But I've always known my destiny

I'll die alone
I'll die alone
In solitude I pray to the man on the golden throne
I'll die alone
Carve my name into the stone

Carve my name into; why do people fear the reaper
The reaper is light
No confession will save me now

I'll die alone
I'll die alone
In solitude I pray to the man on the golden throne
I'll die alone
Carve my name into the stone

In my life I was a loner
And I died in solitude
Is there a golden bridge to heaven
For the misunderstood
Now your eyes are closed forever
Tortured until your dying breath
There's finally peace of mind
For all the lost that was found
In my life I was a loner
And I died in solitude
Is there a golden bridge to heaven
For the misunderstood

Misunderstood

I'll die alone
I'll die alone
