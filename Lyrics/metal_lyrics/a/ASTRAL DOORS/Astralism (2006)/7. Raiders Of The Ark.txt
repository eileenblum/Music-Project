[Johansson / Lindstedt / Nordlund]

Hail Mother Mary, the right way is scary
Stay out; I will beware
Hail Mother Mary, the loving and caring
I stand on the edge of the stair
Fast rolls on the wheels to the future so bright
We're struck; we are

The raiders of the ark
The race is on
Raiders of the ark
I know it's a pity; the lack of desire now

An urge for salvation, alarming for the nation
Fraud is everywhere
Eternal damnation, abusing the treasure
The gospels in the air
Sacred my task though we're leaving this earth
Fall out, we are

The raiders of the ark
The race is on
Raiders of the ark
I know it's a pity; the lack of delight

Blessed be thy child in the black of the night
The spirit's still alive
Shelter from the world never doing what is right
We fear the dark; we're raiders of the ark

[1st solo: Nordlund]
[2nd solo: Haglund]

I cry for the human race
Left another trace
Looking for the ark an endless race
We see but we are blind
Guess we'll never find
The treasure with the rimes
'Cause we walk on the water, we play it again
Too late; we are

The raiders of the ark
The race is on
Raiders of the ark
Rain and fire; taking me higher
Ice and snow; take me home
You know we are searching in the dark
Raiders of the ark
