[Johansson / Nordlund]

Dear Mr devil, your songs were right
Music for the children of the night
Try to learn? Who wants to live forever?
Stay up late until the sunrise
Madness across the town
I see angels fly
A fire in the sky

In rock we trust; in rock we trust
Play loud; no one can break us
In rock we trust; in rock we trust
Rock hard; in rock we trust

Dear Mr devil, you gave the sign
A revelation to open up their minds
To be alive is to be filled with anger
Behold the allied forces
Soldiers in front the stage
We are denim knights
Go higher, realize

In rock we trust; in rock we trust
Play loud; no one can break us
In rock we trust; in rock we trust
Rock hard; 'cause in rock we trust

For rock we live; for rock we die
In rock we trust

[1st solo: Nordlund]
[2nd solo: Haglund]

Attack; the allied forces
Madness across the town
You know we are denim knights
Go higher, realize

In rock we trust; in rock we trust
Play loud; no one can break us
In rock we trust; in rock we trust
We stand for what we are
In rock we trust; in rock we trust
Play loud; none is a faker
In rock we trust; in rock we trust
Rock hard; in rock we trust
