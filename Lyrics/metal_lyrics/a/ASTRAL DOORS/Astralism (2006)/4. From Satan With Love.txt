[Johansson / Haglund / Nordlund]

It's wrong; it's right
You will explode like dynamite
For real; you're sodomized
I am an evil boy
My music shall be played loud
Running with the greyhound
I'm hard; stakes are high
Looking for the manna coming out of the sky

I'm waiting for you all the time

Signed; sealed; delivered
Rise of the figure
Here's from Satan with love

More snow to find
You are a mountain I must climb
No rules for the anti Christ
I sank Noah's Ark
Dying in the playhouse
Tell me why I'm spellbound
My way; the rebel to pay
Whole lotta shaking on the tip of my tongue

Your makeup is the devil's mark

Signed; sealed; delivered
Rise of the figure
Here's from Satan with love

I'll rise up from the ashes
I'll steal away from your cries
From darkness I am coming of
Don't put, don't put me down

[1st solo: Haglund]
[2nd solo: Nordlund]

Signed; sealed; delivered
Rise of the figure
Whole lotta shaking on the tip of my tongue
Signed; sealed; delivered
Rise of the figure
Here's from Satan with love
