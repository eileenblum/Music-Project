[Johansson/ Lindstedt / Nordlund]

In a world of terror

Well, he's a man on a mission; he's sent from Allah
Longing for the glory in Shangri-La
Got God on his side; no one can take him away
He's glorious, he said

Viva the revolution
I know I will be born again
Long live mass confusion
I'm a martyr
Hidden in the London caves
Hidden in the London caves
In the caves of London

I'm a guy with a message, turn on the news
Children of the west; here's the Baghdad blues
There's a bomb in my bag;
Our justice is going to blow you away
I'm glorious, he said

Viva the revolution
I know I will be born again
Long live mass confusion
I'll be a legend, you'll have to face

Terror down under ground in the London caves
Hidden down under ground in the London caves
I will never be found in the London caves
Man of God

[Solo: Nordlund]

I'm a man on a mission, I'm blessed by Allah
Longing for the glory in Shangri-La
Got a bomb in my bag; my justice will blow you away
I'm glorious, I say

Viva the revolution
I know I will be born again
Long live mass confusion
London town under ground
Viva the revolution
I know I will be born again
Long live mass confusion
I'll have a place by the master's side

Terror down under ground in the London caves
Hidden down under ground in the London caves
I will never be found in the London caves
Never
I will never be found
I'm a guy with a message
Hidden in the London caves
