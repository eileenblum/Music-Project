[Johansson / Lindstedt / Nordlund]

Who's to stand when the rocks are rolling?
Who's to dance around the golden calf?
Will the slaves now rule the masters?
In the bloodstained holy land

Shalom; look at yourself
The kingdom won't rise again
A phantom's eyes; a new thrown dice
La'olam; who's king of the kings?

Israel, Israel
Israel; time will always foretell

And Palestine looks for resurrection
The pearly gates closing down
Don't steal from your brother
On my cross I see a world that is turning

Arise; chains ever crack
Outcast in desert land
You can not escape the execrate
Messiah; they'll never forgive

Israel, Israel
Israel; time will always foretell

My soul is burning
It's burning
My world is turning

Behold Israel
You know we cry for you
And then we look into
A phantom eyes; a new thrown dice
Shalom; the kingdom won't rise again
David's star and what we are
Arise; who's king of the kings?
