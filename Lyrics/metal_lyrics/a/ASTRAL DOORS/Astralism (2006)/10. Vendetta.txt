[Johansson / Lindstedt / Nordlund]

I've sworn the oath upon my family grave
I'm dragging you under,
Spirits wander; meet your pain
If you cry as your die
I'll just remind those you fooled with your lies

I know you would like to stab me from behind
It is payback time, so run but you can't hide

[Chorus:]
So don't you stand in my way, I don't want you to stay
My truth is not your lie
Beware if you care, but you can't prepare
Forsaken; the pride
I came to a point of no return, someone's got to burn
Go down, down, down to a warmer place
Revenge for human race

Hey, home boy; you're nothing but a fake
I remember your laughter, the moment after
My soul was raped
But who's laughing now?
The old sun is now colder than ice

Won't be screaming out for vengeance anymore
I've been playing the game enough to change the score

[Chorus]

[1st solo: Nordlund]
[2nd solo: Haglund]

I sworn the oath upon my family grave
I'm dragging you under,
Spirits wander; hope you're afraid
Had a gun under my pillow; now it's gone
The vendetta's now completed, guess I won

[Chorus]

You're a disgrace; you're a fraud; I'll meet your face
The vengeance is mine; you are no friend of mine
