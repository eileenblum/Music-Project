[Johansson / Lindstedt / Nordlund]

About to begin but clouds made of sin
Announced that the building's on fire
Met up with the band; we couldn't understand
Systems now red alert
We looked at a funeral pyre

A song for the starlight
Tumbling down; but why;

There's a fire in our house; no sun at night
A fire in our house
They scream; there's a fire in our house
I saw the light; a fire in our house
Some dude's burned the place to the ground

Went out for a jam it was seven pm
Rehearsed for the tour of our life
Too much of the smoke
Some said: Now we're broke
We'd better off to immigrate
Before it is all too late

A song for the victims of pyromania

There's a fire in our house; I saw the light
A fire in our house
They scream; there's a fire in our house
It's burning down; a fire in our house
That dude burned it down to the ground

A Molotov cocktail through the window
The world must be mad
Fighting the fire with fire

[1st solo: Nordlund]
[2nd solo: Haglund]

So hear what I say; where are your feelings?
What have you done? There's a fire in our house

Me and the boys; we looked through the funeral pyre
A song for the starlight
Tumbling down but why?

There's a fire in our house; no sun at night
A fire in our house
They scream; there's a fire in our house
I saw the light; a fire in our house
Fire in our house
I saw our place burn down to the ground
