[Johansson / Lindstedt / Nordlund]

The sentenced:
Forgive me father for I have sinned

Killed another man
Blood upon my hands
I followed the cold winds
Tracked down by the arm of the law

The warder:
Look at the man you are
We'll switch off your life, it's gone too far
From here there's no escape
And in the death now you're bound to loose
Your one and only wire
More fuel to the pure

The sentenced:
I'm on the green mile trying to get out
Electrical ride into the light

The warder:
And on the green mile you'll never be alone
The guards are there beside you

The sentenced:
So read me my last rites
Give me just one sign
Soon I've paid my crime
Banished out of heaven
Old sparky will make me go down
And after the monsters ball
The rookie's prepared to do it all
This is my last goodbye
The executioner; the lord of might

You are my only saviour
Tried hard to be braver

I'm on the green mile trying to get out
Electrical ride into the light

The Prison Chaplain:
On the green mile you'll never be alone
An angel flies above you

Green mile
Walk the green mile
Green mile

[Solo: Haglund]

Use your only wire
More fuel to the pyre
I'm here to die
I'm on the green mile trying to get out
Out of the cell, into the light
On the green mile you'll never be alone
The guards are there beside you
I'm on the green mile trying to get out
Electrical ride into the light
And on the green mile you'll never be alone
Now electrified, the lightning ride

Walk the green mile
