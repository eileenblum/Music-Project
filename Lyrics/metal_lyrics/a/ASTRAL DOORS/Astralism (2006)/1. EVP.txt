[Johansson / Nordlund]

A strange noise, this can not be right
I toss and I turn, I live and I learn
Lost and lonely tomorrow
Now my bliss and my sorrow
Who's to blame? The soul enterprise

A fool's trial behind enemy lines
With no lawyer
My demons are for real

White noise
Stuck in the twilight zone
I dream in white
White noise
Electric voices; lost in paradise

Won't leave you behind, I still hear the sigh
Waves in the air, the devil may care
Are you real or illusion?
Got no final conclusion
A minefield; the godforsaken side

A brave long ride, won't lead you
Through nothing but sorrow
And men aren't made of steel

White noise
Stuck in the twilight zone
I dream in white
White noise
Electric voices; lost in paradise

[1st solo: Nordlund]
[2nd solo: Haglund]

A brave long ride, won't lead you
Through nothing but sorrow
And men aren't made of steel
A fool's trial behind enemy lines
With no lawyer
My demons are for real

Why? Why did you have to die?

I still can hear
White noise
Stuck in the twilight zone
I dream in white
White noise
Electric voices
Lost in paradise

You can't kill what's already dead
