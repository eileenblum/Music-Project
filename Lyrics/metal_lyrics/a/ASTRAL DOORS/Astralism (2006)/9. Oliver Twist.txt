[Johansson / Lindstedt / Nordlund]

Now listen here
Night is young a moonlit sky
Time to meet the crowd
Union makers of the wild
Into the void out of the sun
Stronger than clever

Power hour in the tower
Life is in a rage
Why? We'll never take a bow
That's our pride

For the king and the queen
We are the soldiers
Now it's time to save our souls
There's always a chance to battle the evil
Out of the light, ride into the mist
Like Oliver Twist

Who's that demon in my head?
A spectre from the past
Fingers crossed, I wonder why
Ain't going to kneel; don't want to be steel
Pick pocketing boys

Life is not an opera, no
Far from the grace
Filth; a life amount the rays
No way

For the king and the queen
We are the soldiers
Now it's time to save our souls
There's always a chance to battle the evil
Never retire; raise your fighting fist
Like Oliver Twist
Oliver Twist
For the king and the queen

[1st solo: Nordlund]
[2nd solo: Haglund]

Power hour in the tower
Far from the grace
Why? We'll never take a bow
That's pride

For the king and the queen
We are the soldiers
Now it's time to save our souls
There's always a chance to battle the evil
Out of the light, right into the mist

Like Oliver Twist
