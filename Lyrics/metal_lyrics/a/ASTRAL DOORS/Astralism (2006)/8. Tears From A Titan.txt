[Johansson / Nordlund / Roberg]

Here I'm lying with the dying

This is a song about a crime, we must tell it again and again
The people cry; revolution, but no one dares
From a whisper in the leaves to the breeze off the ocean
Domino effect when the avalanches start to roll

Look inside the magic ball and show me what is wrong
You're a mystery woman; magic man; you're mesmerized

[Chorus:]
Who'll be there when a titan cries?
With tooth and nail they fight
And they're defending the rights; the light
Some blood must be spilled
In the games when a titan cried
You will see the dictator die
Who'll be king of the Reich of blood?
Tears from a titan

To the master we begged for our lives; one more night
No remorse, executions or fire-might
Mess around get him down; biding time in the wolf's lair
What's another mile? Freedom's closer now

No more concentration camps; burn them to the ground
Cast a spell on the devils hands, the evil eye

[Chorus]

[1st solo: Nordlund]
[2nd solo: Haglund]

Tyranny goes on, father and the son
Prophecies are wrong, no one's here to deliver
Bloody serenade, dying is the aid
Tears from a titan
On and on and on, father and the son
Prophecies are wrong, no one's here to deliver
Bloody serenade, dying is the aid
Tears from a titan
Titan cries; who'll be there when a titan cries?
I will
Titan cries; from the eyes of evil

[Chorus]

Who'll be here when a titan cries?
