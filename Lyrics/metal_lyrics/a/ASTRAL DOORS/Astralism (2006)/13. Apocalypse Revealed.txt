[Johansson / Lindstedt / Nordlund]

Sail away on a ship across the sea
Sail away to the dreams you still believe
But you'll never; never ever find home

Wrong; they all are wrong
I've seen the future virtualized
A vision of doom; no place to run
Fraud, life is a fraud
They are the cult of the cross
Deliver us, enemies of sanctuary

I've tried so many times to learn about the dark
The end of days I feel; apocalypse revealed
Say you will be the one to break the seventh seal
A study in black; it's the last appeal
Apocalypse revealed

Out of your cell you might discover
That there's a psychic tower
Deep inside of everyone
It's out of our sight, erased the sun
Chains; it still remains
No more invisible trails, God has failed
Buried with his foolish pride

Pale's the faceless driver out of seven mortal lies
My future is surreal; apocalypse revealed
Say you will be the one to break the seventh seal
The final eclipse; it's the last appeal
Apocalypse revealed

Freedom at last
Heathen hearts, you fools must bow

[Solo: Nordlund]

Falling down from your spot in universe
Faded out; after this it won't be worse
But we'll never, never ever
Take that they are wrong, they all are wrong
They are the cult of the cross
Deliver us; enemies of sanctuary

I've tried so many times
To learn about the dark
The end of days I feel; apocalypse revealed
Say you will be the one to break the seventh seal
A study in black; it's the last appeal
Apocalypse

Take me to the river and tomorrow's shore
Travel me through tunnels in the mines of war
Apocalypse, the last eclipse
Lead me from temptations from a world of flesh
Mental incarnation; will it stand in the test of time?
Apocalypse revealed; apocalypse is here
