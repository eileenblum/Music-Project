Come winter, come rain, come permanent pain
This time I'm in charge of this runaway train
A vision one night; so clear and so bright
Can you feel me? Please believe me

Let the astral projection begin
By the earth and the moon
Now I'm leaving this body of sin

I will see you

With a stranger's eye
On the other side
I'm watching the age of aquarius
With a stranger's eye
Transcendental ride
Look at yourself
With a stranger's eye

True wisdom you seek, well, that's how you speak
You're stuck to the master like a dog with a leash
With me you'll be safe, you don't have to be brave
We're all children of universe

Meditation brings peace to your mind
By the wind and the sun
The dark spirits are left far behind

I will heal you

What is the meaning of life if you fear?
What is the point keep on breathing when nobody cares?

Come winter, come rain, come permanent pain
This time I'm in charge of this runaway train
With me you'll be safe, you don't have to be brave
We're all children of universe

Let the astral projection begin
By the wind and the sun
The dark spirits are left far behind
I will heal you

With a strangers eye
With a strangers eye
With a strangers eye
On the other side I watch you
