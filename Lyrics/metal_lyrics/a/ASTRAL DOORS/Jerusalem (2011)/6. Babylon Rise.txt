Rise
Babylon rise

I'm the whore of Babylon, come to me I'll sing my song
Prophets try to analyze, am I a tale or antichrist?

Unleash the great sin of Sodom and Gomorrah
Jackals and hounds out on the prowl
Protect yourself, need no one else

Children, unite, let me be your friend
The mother of harlots I am

Babylon rise
Evil is forever
Babylon rise
The resurrection is here

Feed yourself and no one else, the symptom of the world today
Hell is god and god is great, join me now in the fire lake

Democracy's a fake
Say welcome to destruction
A permanent chaos here to unfold
Intolerance and ignorance

Madness divide
Army's on the shore
The lonely invader for sure

Babylon rise
Evil is forever
Babylon rise
The new revelation is here

The mother of harlots I am
Unleash the great sin
The Babylon whore will be a friend of mine

Rise, rise, rise
Don't have to ask myself
Rise
Am I a god or antichrist?

Unleash the great sin of Sodom and Gomorrah
Jackals and hounds out on the prowl
Protect yourself, need no one else

Children, unite
Let me be your friend
The mother of harlots I am
