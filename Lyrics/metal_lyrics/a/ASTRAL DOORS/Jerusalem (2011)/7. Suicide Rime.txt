Now I'm drinking the night away
Working on the suicide rime
There's no reason for one more season
Sharing what is mine

Here you are, my final spell

God is great but I guess I'll see you in hell
There we can ride the flames
The eternal wishing well
You are a lying thief
But I guess I'll see you in hell

My second name is a big mistake
Frantic like a merry go round
Mind intrusion, brain pollution
Suicidal rime

Life or death, it's all the same

Turn your back, but I guess I'll see you in hell
There we can ride the flames
The eternal wishing well
You are a lying thief
But I guess I'll see you in hell
But I guess I'll see you in hell

My suicide rime, my suicide rime

Here you are, my final spell

You've heard it
The story of my life
My suicide rime
