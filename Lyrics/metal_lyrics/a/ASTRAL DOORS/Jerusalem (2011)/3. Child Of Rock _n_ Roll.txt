I'm a child of rock'n'roll

I've climbed up the sacred mountain
I've dived in the darkest of seas
I've read the Koran and the Bible
They didn't set me free
Searched for the power of karma
Travelled to the temple of dawn
Was told 'bout the great Mahayana
It didn't talk to me

I'm a child of rock'n'roll
I'm a child of rock'n'roll
I'm a child of rock'n'roll
Get out of my way, there's a fire in my soul

In school I was punished to silence
At work there was nothing to say
For ages my life was a prison
I had a broken heart
My best friend said, you are crazy
This boring road will lead you to hell
Break out, it's better to burn out than to fade away

Save me from the evil inside my soul
I am losing control 'cause I'm a child of rock'n'roll

Climbed on the sacred mountain
I've dived in the darkest of seas
I've read the Koran and the Bible
They didn't set me free
