It's time to prepare for the attack
This land is forever the darkest of black
We will never, never, ever back down
Start the blitz, who is blix?

The head of the UN inspectors
They're liars and traitors
We speak for the free world
Not commiting a crime

Attack, and then we shall protect
Operation freedom is here
We're saving Iraq
Attack, let's wring that evil neck
Ready to fight in the name of freedom

This was right, I am stronger than steel
Though my friends say that I have deceived my belief
I'm not breaking, shaking, quaking
'cause I can justifiy all my lies

My conscience is clean ask the people
Unenlightened by purpose
The fraud of the century
Not commiting a crime

Attack, and then we shall protect
Operation freedom is here
We're saving Iraq
Attack, let's wring that evil neck
Live and let die in the name of freedom

Revenge of the failure
A gift to your father
Have I been a good boy?
Please say that you're proud
