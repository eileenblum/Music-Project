The time is here to say goodbye
Welcome to heaven my friend
Damage done the war is won
This time I know it will end
Walk the walk, try to practice what you preach
Talk the talk, your rage must be unleashed
Crawl right back into your hole
If you can't look into my eyes

A ghost in the shadows
A symbol of what's sacred
Betrayed at last
Slaughtered by a sin for his sins

Cry out loud, it's the day after yesterday
Black storm cloud will rage in the day after yesterday
Yesterday

The night was young but we were old
See you at the gates of hell
What's the word out on the streets?
Do prophets have something to say?
Break out, get rid of your heavy chains
Think about all the lethal aliens
We're all puppets on a string
Doing what we have been told

The man in the mirror
A portrait of yourself
Congratulate
Our freedom is stronger than pain

Don't need much
Walk the walk
Try to practice what you preach
You are gone
Guess I'll see you at the gates of hell

Still a ghost in the shadows
A symbol of what's sacred
Betrayed at last
Slaughtered by a sin for his sin

By a sin for his sin
Betrayed at last
He was slaughtered
