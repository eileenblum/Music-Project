Well I know it was a tale, but I also know that I will never learn
So the story of my life is a lie and my fortune will never turn

I know I'll burn

Since the dawn of the days
I have looked for the fire within
It's not a penny from the blood red sky

The talisman, my loving light
Heaven is calling
Candles burning in the night

Now and forever
Now you got to help me find

My lost crucifix
Help me find
My lost crucifix
My lost crucifix

On the road to the damned
I have walked on the path of my life
It wasn't easy but I'd go again

Nightmares of insanity
Satan is laughing
Show me just another sign

Now and forever
Now you got to help me find

So the coming of the light was a scene played in my deepest sleep
The secret of my life is a promise no one could ever keep

You know, the talisman, my loving light
Satan is laughing
Candles burning in the night

Now and forever
Now you got to help me find

My lost, my lost, lost crucifix
Help me find, I'm dying, I'm dying
So help me find my lost crucifix
