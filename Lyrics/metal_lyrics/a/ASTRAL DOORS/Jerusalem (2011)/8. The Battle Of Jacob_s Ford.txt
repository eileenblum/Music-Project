Well, is there someone who can tell?
And is there someone who can cast the spell away?

Say you can, I'll be damned, walk on the water
Saladin had to win
They were lambs on their way to slaughter

In the name of the Lord
They were fighting in rage
Not a glorious state
A bloody holy war

Why?
It's a struggle but no one is sorry
Why?
We are ready to do it again

March, we're going out to war
Like shelter from the storm
The battle of Jacob's Ford
March, their fundaments will break
The ground about to shake
In the battle of Jacob's Ford

Sacrifice under the sun
On the dunes of sand they did what had to be done
In the search of the grail
It's a task no one knows
By the honor of God
Another broken law

Why?
It's a minds game but no one is asking
Why?
And they do it again and again

Heaven is lost, a picture inside
Bury the bleeding, comfort the blind
Heaven is just a servant of hell, we're all fools
Heaven is lost, a picture inside
Bury the bleeding, comfort the blind
Heaven is just a servant of hell
We're all fools in life's wishing well

Well, is there someone who can tell?
And is there someone who can cast the spell away?

Say you can, I'll be damned, walk on the water
Saladin had to win
They were lambs on their way to

Is there someone who can tell?
Is there someone who can tell me
Is there someone?
Is there someone?
Is there someone who can tell me?
