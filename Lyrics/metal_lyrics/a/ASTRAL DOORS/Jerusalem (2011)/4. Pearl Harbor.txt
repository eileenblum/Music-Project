Thousands were summoned, to protect their land
Flag of their fathers, dear old uncle sam

This is the day the training must pay
The enemy's here, we all know
The futures and pasts nothing will last
It's a nightmare but for real

Run away, madness arising
Run away, eastern eruption, out of the sky

Pearl Harbor
Attack of the island in the sun
Pearl Harbor
The battle was lost
But the war was won

Warhawks and zeroes, evil in the air
Death in the water, dead bodies everywhere

Dragged into war, that big ugly whore
So vicious so greedy and dark
It's just like today, the poor has to pay
For the stripes and shining stars

No more fear, surf on the fire
Raging flames burning inside this last samurai

Run away, madness arising
Run away, eastern eruption, out of the sky

Pearl Harbor
Set me free
Pearl Harbor
I'll set you free
