My pretty little angel eyes, every little thing you do to me
I know your love will kill me
Pretty little angel eyes, every little word you throw at me
I know someone will break us down
Forgive them too blinded to see

[Chorus:]
Because it's third strike and out; hitting the balls in the light
Greenfield of life
Third strike, I'm done; missed the test flight to the stars
Greenfield of life

Adrenaline starts to pump, get in to a state of misery
This time no one can take me
I only see it black or white, beaten by my own hypocrisy
This time I want you to hold me down
Forgive those who did not believe

[Chorus:]
Because it's third strike and out; hitting the balls in the light
Greenfield of life
Third strike, I'm done; missed the test flight to the stars
Greenfield of life

I can never believe in what I see; I can never foretell about the need
I am a liar I play it in repeat; I am the fire you never gonna see

I can never believe in what I see; I can never foretell about the need
I am a liar I play it in repeat; I am the fire you never gonna see

[Solo]

Someone will break us down; forgive them too blinded to see

[Chorus:]
Because it's third strike and out; hitting the balls in the light
Greenfield of life
Third strike, I'm done; missed the test flight to the stars
Greenfield of life

Third strike and out; hitting the balls in the light
Greenfield of life
Third strike, I'm done; missed the test flight to the stars
(Greenfield of life)
Greenfield of life
(Greenfield of life)
Greenfield of life

Greenfield of life
