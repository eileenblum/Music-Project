Lost and gone, traces found; evil souls and evil hearts
Lost in the twilight, the day can't be found; heathens of the holy ground
They are lying; the prince of the dark says it's time to come home
Evil injections go straight through the heart, people with the Devil's mark
It is rising, the kingdom of pleasure and eternal pain
Set them free, soon they'll have to see
No one can be blind when he stands by the masters of
Hell and Heaven

[Chorus:]
To burn in the fire and flame again and again
Two people of lust in the unbroken chain
In the fire and flame, no light in the black
Into the pyre of man; fire and flame
Fire and flame

Satan is anxious he wants to come home, virgin of the holy man
They are strangers; thousands will gather to pray in their names
Set them free, soon they'll have to see
Maybe they will find a haven somewhere in between
Hell and Heaven

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
