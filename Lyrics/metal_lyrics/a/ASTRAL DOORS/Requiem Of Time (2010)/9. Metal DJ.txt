He played Sabbath bloody Sabbath
In the basement people worshiped in stereo
Best friend was Uriah, I tell you loud and clear
Boys get ready to fight; all right we are princes of the night
Weekend warriors, disciples of hard rock radio

[Chorus]
He was a Metal DJ
Metal DJ; once and forever
Metal DJ
Like children we learned, he took us to burn

Black night and star struck
With a whole lotta love at space station number 5
Charlotte the harlot saw when Rosie broke the law
Boys get ready to fight; tonight we are hungry like before
Vinyl renegades; destroyers of public radio

[Chorus]
Our tables have turned

Metal DJ; I raise my glass
Metal DJ; I fill my cup
Metal DJ; I drink to you

[Solo]

He played the heavy songs
He was our mentor
With lessons in rock

[Chorus]
And don't you know he was a Metal DJ
Metal DJ, playing all the heavy songs
Metal DJ
We lived and we learned he took us to burn
And don't you know he was a Metal DJ
Metal DJ; once and forever
Metal DJ
Like children we learned, he took us to burn
We drink to you
Heavy Metal DJ
