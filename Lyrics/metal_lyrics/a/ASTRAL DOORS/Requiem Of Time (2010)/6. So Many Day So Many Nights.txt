The wizard in white; as the day turned to night in the year of never
Observing the sky as the wolf starts to cry; sleep forever
See the bleeding faces, fell the winds of lost places again
So many days so many nights
So many days so many nights; dreaming
A sorcerer's spell, he kills and he tells about the gods forsaken
Possessed by the sign, the cursed and the rime; wicked taker
See the bleeding faces, fell the winds of lost places again

[Chorus:]
So many days so many nights, dreamer, screamer, look at the world
So many days so many nights, danger, stranger, walk through the black
So many days so many nights, So many days so many nights
So many days so many nights
They're standing on the outside, they try to get in

[Solo]

The wizard in white; as the day turned to night in the year of never
Observing the sky as the wolf starts to cry; sleep forever
See the bleeding faces, fell the winds of lost places again

[Chorus:]
So many days so many nights, dreamer, screamer, look at the world
So many days so many nights, danger, stranger, walk through the black
So many days so many nights, The wizard in white
So many days so many nights, I have wondered...
