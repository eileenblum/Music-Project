Satanic tribute or a holy sign; it's burning tonight
Turned upside down, the last will of the crucified
Rise; all you people must rise to make them all realize
This is a war we cannot win
Life is a dark road and it's leading straight to Hell

[Chorus:]
Are they divine or occult those who kneel by St-Peter's cross
See the altar of the damned; St-Peter's cross

Symbolic value caught up in between the cross and the belief
Unholy game; it cannot be an happy end
Liar, you're going down in fire; you'll have to stand before Lucifer's trial
In this human sacrifice
Road to redemption but the masters don't ask twice

[Chorus:]
Are they divine or occult those who kneel by St-Peter's cross
See the altar of the damned; St-Peter's cross

[Solo]

A simple sinner or from Heaven sent; of innocence born
Turned upside down, the last will of the crucified
Life is a dark road and it's leading straight to Hell

[Chorus:]
Are they divine or occult those who kneel by St-Peter's cross
See the altar of the damned; St-Peter's cross

Are they divine or occult those who kneel by St-Peter's cross
See the altar of the damned; St-Peter's cross

St-Peter's cross

Oh yeah!
