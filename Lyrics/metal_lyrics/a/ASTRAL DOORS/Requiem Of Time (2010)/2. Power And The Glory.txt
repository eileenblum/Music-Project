In the land of the dark where the horsemen ride
It is written and told 'bout the other side
They are disciples without knowing why
And they're blessed with a gift; so determined to die
Heaven and Hell; fire and ice

[Chorus:]
It's the power and the glory
In paradise you'll be rewarded for your sacrifice
It's the power and the glory
Now it's your turn, set the unholy people to burn

In the cold of the night in the pale moon light
Say a prayer to the one and his last goodbye
Captured by evil and makers of lies
Trapped in a world where the outcast will rise
Fortunate and fame; life is a game

[Chorus:]
It's the power and the glory
In paradise you'll be rewarded for your sacrifice
It's the power and the glory
Now it's your turn, set the unholy people to burn

[Solo]

We're talking 'bout heaven and Hell; fire and ice

[Chorus:]
It's the power and the glory
In paradise you'll be rewarded for your sacrifice
It's the power and the glory
Now it's your turn, set the unholy people to burn
