Defenders of the world now forsaken
Stealers of the sun in the making
Chaos and destruction all around this time
Mirror, mirror:  who's the liar?
To be or not to be; who was the soldier with a heart?
Master and slave, so many miles apart

[Chorus:]
You must surrender tonight, there will be a tomorrow
Words must be stronger than weapons of steel
Remember the days in a decade of sorrow
Come to life rainbow warrior
The rainbow warrior

Protectors of the earth; profit maker
Surfing on the waves; nuclear shaker
I may be a cynic but you'll burn in Hell
Infant killer down in fire
Ten tons of metal goes down to the bottom of the deep
Ghost of the sailor and the guardian of the sea

[Chorus:]
You must surrender tonight, there will be a tomorrow
Words must be stronger than weapons of steel
Remember the days in a decade of sorrow
Come to life rainbow warrior

The man on the moon awake in the night
The king  of the sea; is God left behind
A twist of the truth, a child of rebirth
In colors so bright here on earth

[Solo]

Who was the soldier with a heart?
Master and slave, so many miles apart

[Chorus:]
You must surrender tonight, there will be a tomorrow
Words must be stronger than weapons of steel
Remember the days in a decade of sorrow
Come to life...

You must surrender tonight, there will be a tomorrow
Words must be stronger than weapons of steel
Remember the days in a decade of sorrow
Come to life... rainbow warrior
The rainbow warrior
The rainbow warrior
