As I left with a grin you stood by the grave
A pilgrim's confusion. From the crypt came the fools on parade
Was born with this urge. The future looked bright
They called me the chosen one blessed with this might
Then on the stage I saw that crippled little child
In tears before the new born savior

[Chorus:]
I got the power to heal
I got the power to heal
While you run like a rat in your wheel
I got the power to heal
I got the power to heal
Now I'm sick of your lies
Be sure of that I have got the power to heal
The power to heal

My path may be grim, but I do what I like
A menace to wisdom, I'm the nail they're so eager to bite
Am I dirty or clean or something in between?
My mind may be broken but my heart's made of steel
The hand of late is here to lead me through the night
Just like a soldier of desire

[Chorus:]
I got the power to heal
I got the power to heal
In control of the cards that you deal
I got the power to heal
I got the power to heal
When you clutch after straws
My call says that I have got the power to heal

[Solo]

[Chorus]
