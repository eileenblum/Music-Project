Early in the morning; it's time for you to go
I guess you're a disciple of the clock
You're dreaming away, I hear what you say
To live a life so boring is nothing we can do
We're writing down the testament; the testament of rock

We came into the light; with rock we conquered the fear
Hard times, life was a fight; in denim and leather with hearts made of steel
Banged our heads against the wall,
Raised our fists and yelled
Knock, knock open up the door;
It's alive
So sing with me
We'll always sing our fighting song

[Chorus:]
We'll never stop; forever strong, it goes on and on and on
We're here to write the will; the testament of rock

Get lost you posers of fraud; low life you run with the pack
Stay true, no mainstream betray;
We live as we learn
Let us take you to burn
Sold ours souls to rock'n'roll to live forevermore
If it's too loud than you're too old;
Scream it out and let it bleed
Another day another song

[Chorus:]
We're writing down the testament, it's our last will and our last call
Writing down the testament; we're bound to rise and you shall fall

[Solo]

Banged our heads against the wall;
Raised our fists and yelled
Knock, knock open up the door;
It's alive, so sing with me
I'll always sing my fighting song

[Chorus]
