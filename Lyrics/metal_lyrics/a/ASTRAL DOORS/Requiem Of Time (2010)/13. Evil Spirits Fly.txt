Heavy thoughts in the dark
Hell on earth for the man without a heart
Suicide worth a try; let the sky fall down
All alone forever lost like the stranded
On the shore where specters cry

[Chorus:]
Evil spirits fly, you can't hold on
There's nowhere to hide
When evil spirits fly above us all
Forever and ever, forever and ever more

What is life, what is lust?
If you're stuck inside a world you cannot trust
Exorcised by the words from your poisoned mind
In the torture of the night, ask the angels
For the road to peace

[Chorus:]
Evil spirits fly, you can't hold on
There's nowhere to hide
When evil spirits fly above us all
Forever and ever, forever and ever more

[Solo]

All alone forever lost like the stranded
On the shore where specters cry
Evil, oh so evil

[Chorus:]
Evil spirits fly, you can't hold on
There's nowhere to hide
When evil spirits fly above us all
Forever and ever, forever and ever more

And we all must die, we all must die
Evil spirits fly
