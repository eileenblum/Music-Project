Hear the sound of the river, it'll drag you down
You've been walking through the fire
You've been raised in misery; in the name of God
See the rage of the water and prepare to drown
Like the wounded wants a doctor, son you really need a boat
To stay alive as nature's running wild

[Chorus:]
Blood River; sail away
When you see the light, the time has come to pay
Blood River
You may try to run, they'll find you anyway

By the shore someone's laughing; now it's you against the world
They've been lying they have cheated, made a wasteland of the earth
without knowing why the innocent must die

[Chorus:]
Blood River; sail away
When you see the light, the time has come to pay
Blood River
You may try to run, they'll find you anyway

Life is not a fairytale; life is not a game to play
longing for last goodbye, waiting for the final trial

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Blood River; sail away
When you see the light, the time has come to pay
Blood River
You may try to run, they'll find you anyway
