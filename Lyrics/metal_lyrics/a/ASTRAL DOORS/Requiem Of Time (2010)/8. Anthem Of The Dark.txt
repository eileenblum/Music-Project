This is the anthem of the dark
They are here again; the spirits of the dark
In the house of the holy; with the Devil's mark
Shine on; shine on; forever and forevermore
I can see it clear so please turn off the light
Making melodies and words about astral nights
Dream on; dream on; tomorrow belongs to the sun

[Chorus:]
Don't fear what you hear, salvation is near
Today's not a good day to die
Don't deny what you see; it's time to believe
The notes that we found in the ark
The anthem of the dark
Uprising from the twilight zone
The anthem of the dark
He was sentenced to oblivion

On the witches hill the madness has begun
Resurrection of the outcast; the falling one
Angel of angel; he laughed when you fell from the sky

[Chorus:]
They are here again, the spirits, the spirits of the dark
In the house of the holy; with the Devil's mark

[Solo]

Now we offer you the music of our souls
First the stone begins to bleed and then it'll start to roll
Shine on; shine on; your kingdom shall finally rise

[Chorus]
