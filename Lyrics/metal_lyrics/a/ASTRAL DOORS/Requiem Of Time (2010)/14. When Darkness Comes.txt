Hand on the bible; hand on the book that speaks of war
Two different faces of the world
Now and for always; look there behind the walls of time
To blind the world and see

[Chorus:]
When the darkness comes; screams of silence
Soon it's done; when darkness comes
When darkness comes

Life's just a requiem; death is a never ending song
Invite the spirits of relief to the house without windows
Lost since the days when legends lived
The only quest is to breathe

[Chorus:]
When the darkness comes; screams of silence
Now it's done; when darkness comes
Close the fire power child; it's the Devil's eye
When darkness comes
Is this the creation of new incarnations between good and bad?
A sign of the afterlife or a dream to be dreamed, to be dreamed

[Solo]

I believe the darkness, it's my only friend
Heavenly father; I no longer bother
Oh, I'm waiting for the day

[Chorus:]
When the darkness comes; screams of silence
Now it's done; when darkness comes
Close the fire power child; it's the Devil's eye
When darkness comes
You know, you know that you never will die
When darkness comes
