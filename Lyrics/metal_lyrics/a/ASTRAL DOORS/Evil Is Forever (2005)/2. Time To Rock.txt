[Johansson / Nordlund / Lindstedt]

It's another boring day; I wanted to run
And people in my way
Oh, what have I done?

Here we are, time to stay Raw
Burning up but what do we know?
Live to learn; wait another minute
By the will to die

Their haunted houses were made of strangers
He'll break the sun and light
The marker's cleared and locked

It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
When your cell is down and locked
It's time to rock

There is a lonely man
He's taking control
He might be doing wrong
It's eating his soul

Came out; riding the law
They're forced to say: we'll open the door
In between; lost inside a riddle
And we may have to die

He live upon the edge of danger
They'll hold their weapons down
But I will never stop

It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
Yes, when your world is down and locked
It's time to rock

[Solo: Nordlund]

Their haunted houses were made of strangers
He'll break the sun and light
The maker's cleared and locked

It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
Yes when your mind is cleared and locked
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
Wes when your world is down and locked
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
It's time to rock
All around the world
And I will never ever stop
And I ain't never gonna drop
It's time to rock
