[Johansson / Haglund]

In the picture of the soldier
In a world that's getting colder
Colors balms for my kind
Some were looking for this haven
Rumors blowing in the wind
Oh please, let me stay for a while

They came across the water
To escape from the slaughter
I took my chance but I wnted to pay
A poor boy has to lose; it's black, white and grey

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls
I can still recall
All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
There was fear in their eyes

No medication from a doctor
Could ever heal this broken man
I needed someone to hold
The purgatory of life
Brought the violence to my heart
Sorry babe; forgive me babe
Now I'm gone

My execration
Of the world that rules the nation
I'm not a boy, I stand equal to God
Don't need any money
I do what I want

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls
I can still recall
All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
It was in their eyes

[Solo: Haglund]

For the king and the castle
For the knight of the swords
I will march out to war
They are dying there; dying there
But the pain has been here for so long
Determination of my home land
The Promised Land

I too my chance but I wanted to pay
A poor boy has to lose; it's black, white and grey

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls
I can still recall
All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
I saw fear in your eyes
Fear in their eyes
