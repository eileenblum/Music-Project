[Johansson / Nordlund / Lindstedt]

Came out of speed and I knew that I'd won
Turning the steel for the king and his crown
Scared from the start, I could never be late
Leaving the others for a lonely day

You know I never needed love
Don't you lie; never lie
I guess you'll stay the night awake
I'm going to win what's to take

You pull the break
You pull the break
You pull the break
You know what to take
You pull the break
You pull the break
You pull the break
You're a loser, your ground will quake
You pull the break

Married the highway; sleeping with the road
Talk to myself, I'm about to explode
Using my sense, I will never return
Bur one day you're all about to burn

I wish that I had wings to fly
Way up high, so high
Tomorrow will be all too late
Only for one man's mistake

You pull the break
You pull the break
You pull the break
You know what to take
You pull the break
You pull the break
You pull the break
You're a loser, your ground will quake
You pull the break

[Solo: Nordlund]

Here I go, no
You know I never needed love
Don't you lie
I guess you'll stay the night awake
I'm going to win what's to take
Break
I live what to take
Don't pull, don't pull
You pull the break
You pull the break
You pull the break
You know what to take
You pull the break
You're faster than the speed of light
You're holding on the curves so tight
I know that I will live to die
I know I will live to die; oh die
