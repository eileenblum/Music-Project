[Johansson / Nordlund / Lindstedt]

Russian tundra, cold is the night
Still it's not too late
There's no bail; Siberian trail
Doomed to live my last days
Like a cursed in the dark

From the eye you can't hide
When the fatherland decides you're Christ
In their state they create a better race

But take my warning
It is right before your eyes
A new time dawning
Gonna send me off
To Stalingrad

A fatal birth of one mans earth
Now it's all too late
Curtain of iron, confusion in the crowd
A union made by violence, greed and force
To tame all the men in the land
And to crush their houses of glass; in flesh
On my way to Gulag this preacher spoke

He said:
Take my warning
It is right before your eyes
A new time dawning
We will die
For the traitor of mankind
They made me fight in Stalingrad
All the people died in Stalingrad

[Solo: Nordlund / Haglund]

I'm a cursed in the dark
From the eye you can't hide
When the fatherland decides you're a Christ
In the state they create a better race

But take my warning
It's the beginning of the end
A new time dawning
Defenders of the worst of crimes
Take my warning
It is right before your eyes
A new time dawning
We will die for the traitor of mankind
We will die in Stalingrad
We will die in Stalingrad
