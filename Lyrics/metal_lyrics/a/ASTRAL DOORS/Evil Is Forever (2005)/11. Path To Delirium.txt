[Johansson / Nordlund / Lindstedt]

In the feet of dawning; to the pagan sea
For the breath of yawning; falling like a leaf
See the cries of the aged and wise
The know where the world will go

Way down to the train of the caravan
Won't you give it away, give it away
Give your life or you will stand alone
Open up the gate and try

Let the black sun shine
All you fools and those to stay
Let the black sun shine
Heroes die and so do I
And so do I

When the giant's falling and your spirit rise
Distant voices calling; make your sacrifice
Your life's not an easy ride
For those on the other side

Don't run to the scene of another crime
Won't you give it away, give it away
Give your life; don't climb the mountain high
Open up the gate and try

Let the black sun shine
Start to run, start to run
Let the black sun shine
Heroes die and so do I
So do I

Maybe some can realize that the closer to our God
Flames and songs in Neverland
You are there and never coming home
There's an evil song to the world tonight
Delirium; save me God; save me God

[Solo: Nordlund]

So give your life or you will stand alone
Open up the gate and try

Let the black sun shine
All you fools and those to stay
Let the black sun shine
Heroes die and so do I
So do I
Master of deliria; keep away, won't let it out
Let the black sun shine
All the fools in the masquerade
Seduction of the good and brave
Black; let the black sun shine

All lyrics by Nils Patrik Johansson

"I want to share these words with you,
I can still remember, I can still recall the day when the world fell down.
It was in the worst of days.
And it was a different time but I will never forgive you for what you did to me that night"
