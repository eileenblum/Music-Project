[Johansson / Nordlund / Lindstedt]

If you are wind, I would go to a place where wind don't blow
It's time to leave
If you are steel, I would be like a flame to melt you down
You have to see and tell me why you cry
Why you cry

He came to save our lives; to kill the tyrant and the beast
He brought a legion
And maybe one day he will rise up and say:
I fought in this holy war, in quest to find the Astral Doors
Look into the future; you'll fall forever

In the slaughter to release us; we shall survive

Lionheart
Lionheart
Brave and divine
Lionheart
We stand for the sake, fighting side by side

They came to paradise; I stood beside them in my dreams
And all those pages
To me seemed so real though they're all make believe
Liar; how you sacrificed my soul
Got no wish of growing old
And when I die at last; I won't miss you

To the warrior from the loser; who can survive?

Lionheart
You are stronger than the steel
Lionheart
Brave and divine
Lionheart
You are riding on the wings of Heavens might
Fighting side by side

[Solo: Nordlund / Nordlund]

In the slaughter to release us; we shall survive

Lionheart
Lionheart
Brave and divine
Lionheart
We stand for the sake, my life at stake
Lionheart
You are stronger than the steel
Lionheart
Brave and divine
Lionheart
You are riding on the wings of Heavens might
Fighting side by side

If you are steel, I would be like a flame to melt you down
You have to see and tell me why
