[Johansson / Nordlund / Lindstedt]

Come along
Won't you hear my song?

Well, there's a mystic river; many people shiver
But I will burn with delight
Dragons to the left; maidens to the right
Brimstone, fire and ice

And I shall always sing my song
I'll always be around to praise the bones

Praise the bones
I can't create another rime
Inside a fantasy world
We are living for to praise the bones

I saw elves and striders; black horse riders
Mean machines ready to strike
I read it in the cradle; keep it on the table
Religion meant for a child

And I shall always sing my song
I'll always be around to praise the bones

Praise the bones
I can't create another rime
Inside a fantasy world
We are living for to praise the bones

Praise the bones
Praise the bones
Praise the bones
Oh no
Come on and praise it

[Solo: Nordlund / Haglund]

And I shall always sing my song
I'll always be around to praise the bones

Praise the bones
I can't create another rime
Inside a fantasy world
We are living for to praise the bones

Praise the bones
