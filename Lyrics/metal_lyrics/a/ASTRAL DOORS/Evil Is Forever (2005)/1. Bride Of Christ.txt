[Johansson / Nordlund / Haglund]

He's an unholy ranger, not a logical trainer
A prior and preacher with style
No one knew he was able
No one heard 'bout the chamber
In the darkest of dark
On the back side of religion

Enchanter and Judas; murderer and thief
Tempting the weak and foretold about the

Glory of heaven, it's for now and forever; you and I
The Bride of Christ
Not evil, but afraid he would leave here there behind
She's the Bride of Christ

She had been there forever and she wasn't so clever
She fell just like rain from the sky
He stood in the middle; Stan played on his fiddle
They danced in their church
To celebrate their new Messiah

Glory of heaven, it's for now and forever; you and I
The Bride of Christ
Not evil, but afraid he would leave here there behind
She's the Bride of Christ

"You can all meet Jesus.
You can all be a part of his great big family.
So come and join the army:
Be a soldier in the name of God!"

[Solo: Nordlund / Haglund]

Enchanter and Judas; murderer and thief
Tempting the weak and foretold about the

Glory of heaven, it's for now and forever; you and I
The Bride of Christ
Not evil, but afraid he would leave here there behind
She's the Bride of Christ
Glory of heaven, it's for now and forever; you and I
The Bride of Christ
Not evil, but afraid he would leave here there behind
She's the Bride of Christ
Bride of Christ
Bride of Christ
The men in the village had to bow for the Bride of Christ
Bride of Christ
Bride of Christ
The comen and children, obeying the Bride of Christ
No, no
She won't come to heaven
