Diminished
The aegis torn apart
Exposing the core
Relentless viral decoding
Raping the depths of my mind
Optical stimulation
Illusions holding my fixation
...purge system engaged...

Systematic chain of sedations
Injecting the confinement
To a lifeless shell
Through feeble eyes, I behold
A blurred delusion in fear of treachery
...fading...

Glaring lights burn in our eyes
Alchemic alterations
In searing optic precision
Reconstructing our perception
To fabricate reality

We are the suffering
The souls to burn
With hope, we may obtain
A state of perfection

Force-fed solution
Unyielding
Succumb to the "absolute truths"
In fragmented conceptions
Filling our lungs
...our beings...
Drowning the virus

Channeled
Executing the extraction
Sustain
Attain the conversion
Forging the eye
Open your eyes and see
A new sense of reality
System disengage
