Tearing away from earthen arms
I am free from the grave
The ashes of faith that faintly burn
As I stand within my fate
Remind me of you
For I have lost the strength to see
As I wander the darkest depths of ruin
I cant find the will to believe
Tearing away from this false sense of reason
I'm still bound within this dream
Where the manifestations of my regrets
Keep pulling me back
But who would I be?
To die amongst the weak...

As I tear away
I am painted with crimson resolve

I am defined through adversity
The depths that I bleed
Through the endless afflictions, I strive to succeed
I will never lose my will to breathe

Without struggle we are nothing
We have not bled enough

May scarlet life rain down from me
And prove my devotion
Afflictions cast shall ever seed
Strength in mortality

I am defined through adversity
I will never lose my will to breathe

"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."
[Dr. Martin Luther King]
