And so it begins
From a resting place of memories
Lost so long ago
The faint echoes of life
Resounding from deep within the flow of time
From what did these sands of fate begin to fall
Forcing us to awaken
Unveiling our eyes

And for this moment...
We stand, overwhelmed, beneath the sky
Staring into salvation

Entwined in this vow
This attainment of reason
A call to the life that's sleeping in our blood
We'll drink of this faith
Until it drowns our disbelief

Purpose has chosen me
For once, I can breathe
And feed the shred of hope
Buried deep within my lust
Beneath the scars
Beneath the shell of my content

Entwined in this vow
This attainment of reason
A call to the life that's sleeping in our blood
We'll drink of this faith
Until it drowns our disbelief

Awakened
In this rite of passage
Culling the thirst of our flesh
With promise
Seemingly written in the sky
And for this moment...
We drown in this faith
