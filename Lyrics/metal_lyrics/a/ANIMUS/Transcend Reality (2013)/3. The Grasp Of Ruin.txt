Acceptance
This cunning dagger
Dripping with illusive doom
Preying on the weak, myopic minds
Clouding their reason
This treacherous contractor
Assuring the skin-deep convictions
With justification
An escape from the onerous course

Now go ahead
Fulfill the tragedy in disbelief
And rest in the grasp of ruin
Coward! Faithless!
Betrayer!
You errant fool!

Breathe in relief
And choke on the ashes
Of countless works undone
This sanctuary came with destruction
Know this forever
Blood is on your hands

This ravenous vulture
Aroused by the blood of the hopeless
With blackened, starving eyes
It waits for your dreams to die
Will you give in?
Have you ever, for even a moment
Reasoned with your fear?
No one is innocent

Coward! Faithless!
Betrayer!
You errant fool!

Breathe in relief
And choke on the ashes
Of countless works undone
This sanctuary came with destruction
Know this forever
Blood is on your hands
