I have opened a door sealed shut
Back to where I began
Through the depths of existence
Transversing the webs of subconscious
I make my way to the source
...the core
Unresolved and unanswered
I have returned

I peer through the glass
...and regress
As I test my reflection's faith
I can feel your fate
...suffering counted in sand...

How much do you fear?!
How much do you regret?!

I wont let the fear of a revelation waste away my existence

Yet something now feels so unreal
As our connection intensifies
Reality slips away
Ripped into the void of our dimensional clarity
...or dementia, as our memories align
A vast illusion breaks at the peak of my vertigo
As the misconception subsides

Numb... breathless
Unearthing the truth
Buried in the perils of chronophobia
I am the lie
The shadow... the mask
The archetypal portrayal
Untouched by fear

And this is the final delirium
The catalyst that set the works in motion
I am the product of logic and sand
For we are but fragments of being
As you have been lost within the glass

I wont let the fear of annihilation waste away my existence

I leave behind a shattered hourglass
The destruction of my limitations
If the inevitable surely comes to pass in time
I will not be swayed by fear
