Developed perception
In cognitive immersion
Masking the certainty... the reality
In this design, I find solace

Yet the depths of regret
Set this altered mind faltering
Again and again, I watch it decay

Coveting the frail shell of a memory
My resolve has cursed this blood-stained soil

Here I stand, in ruination
Among the cinders of destruction
As I have bled the sky of its tranquility
Where life once flourished...
And all that's left is the swarming of ashes
Now burning my skin
This is torment
This is completion...

Crushing the frail shell of a memory
My curse has resolved this blood-stained soil

What is perfection to me?
The growth of the seed
The knowledge that I am the artist
And this is my masterpiece
My curse, my resolve
