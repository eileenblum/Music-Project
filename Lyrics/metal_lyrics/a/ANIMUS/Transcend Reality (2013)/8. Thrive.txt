A new state of genesis
Untouched
Provision to the starving array
The ravenous, the defiled
And with hope, the corruptible
Are we now the blight?

Through the burning
...the purification...
This self desecration
We have become a virus
Designed for prolific infection

A new breed of salvation
To rise through suffering
Distorted
We will spread this contagion
And the corrupted shall breed chaos

Savored and savoring
We are slaves to the system
Spreading a new disease
Compromising life
For eternity

A new sense of perception
Irrepressible
A sea of eyes have turned to black
A reign of blood-lust overwhelms
Beneath the golden ash
Our time has come to flourish
Thrive in what we bleed
Go forth and spread the chaos

Through the burning
...the purification...
This self desecration
We have become a virus
Designed for prolific infection

Savored and savoring
We are slaves to the system
Spreading a new disease
Compromising life
For eternity

Synergy
Through which we survive
Is imminent
A step in the delusion of fate
...if there were such a thing
Born of a machine
We live for eternity
