With impervious focus
I peer into a world of my own design
Where my thoughts echo through dimensions
Gilding reality

Distorting the cognitive plane
I am free from imperfections
And my vision... absolute
As I stare into the crystalline

Yet why does my focus betray me?
How long have I stood within this hourglass?
Tormenting
My mind resonates in the clarity
The vociferous fragmentation
Of a self, once forsaken
Buried beneath
...staring back at me...

Where dimensions merge
I stand, unresolved
With ten thousand regrets
Slipping through my fingers

Focus
Drown out the resonating reflection
The defect of this eye's forged mockery
At the throne, my touch is golden
my breath... is golden
Wrought by overwhelming sacrifice

But why can my mind transcend reality?
With deafening reveries of what I've abandoned
...of what I've forsaken
...of what bleeds within...
Drown out the silence!
Focus before this evolves!

Opposite
I stand beside myself
One bleeds from the ears
One bleeds from the eyes
Crowned in reality
Immersed in the sand

Drown out the silence
So I can sleep
