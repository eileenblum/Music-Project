Sentiment has proven its worthlessness
In this discordant existence
And now my anima has been sealed away
Cold, mechanical, and ruthless
I assume a new path with the same destination
Destroying everything that stands in my way

Through vexing resolve,
I defy the beliefs of my truest self
I've become heartless
As there is nothing left to bleed
...I am so far away from my truest self...

I am an omen
I am a spear with an ashen wake
My course is doomed
For I have become self-sustaining

Through vexing resolve,
Into the fires of chaos,
I begin my descent
