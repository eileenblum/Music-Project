Welcome to the time of degeneration
Following eyes - eyes so blind
Slaves of a dogmatic indoctrination
But what's beyond threatening destination

Make sure that this jester life
Is a task in hell's embrace
The poison is taking effect
Follow the Blind

Is all that we seem to be and our knowledge
Nothing but a hellish fever called living?
So set the angels free from sick reality
Set them free - Set'em free!!!

Welcome to blindness hellish raped slaves
Dig your own graves, waste your veins
Blind your eyes, the Hellishgrind
Blind leads Blind

Punish the light
The daybreak should never come
Unleash the night
Vengeance be mine
Don't follow the Blind

Welcome to blindness hellish raped slaves
Dig your own graves, waste your veins
Blind your eyes, the Hellishgrind
Blind leads Blind

And I - Will - Say
Punish the light
The daybreak should never come
Unleash the night
Vengeance be mine
Don't follow the Blind
Don't follow!!!
