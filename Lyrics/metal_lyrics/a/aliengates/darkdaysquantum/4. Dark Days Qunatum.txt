Through the ages of twilight we came
We were sunborn
Standing between good and evil
But its creatures are neither of them

The attraction for a quest in fire
Who set ablaze the carnage in thy mind
But everyone alone here to stay
Sunborn - Waiting for the rain
Their soulspark has gone away
Still fading day after day

Come!
Be ready for the quantum
Burning, fading, we appear to fall again
Join me - We shall fall - We fall
A thousand stellar evolutions die
Come, come and curse my dark days

And as we weave the light its end
Who will bear all the sins of mankind?
Shall there be another again?!

Through the ages of twilight we come
We are sunborn!!!
A thought between good and evil
But see every soul alone here to stay
Their mindspark has gone away
Still fading day after day

Come!
Be ready for the quantum
Burning, fading, we appear to fall again
Join me - We shall fall - We fall
A thousand stellar evolution dies
Come, come and cure my dark days
