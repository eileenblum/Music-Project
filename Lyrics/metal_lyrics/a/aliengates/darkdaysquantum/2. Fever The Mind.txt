Feeding the fever
With the sorrow they adore
Give them the pain they love
The pain for insanity and chaos
The chaos - A bite for more

The order to darkening the skies
The might to prevent the days
With a heart of stone cold as ice
Begone, Lord of forgiveness

Enter the fever forever!

Feeding the fever
With the sorrow they want
Now give'em the lies they need
The lies for insanity and chaos
The chaos - A creed in gore

Prepare to enter my nightmare
Beware - Fever the mind
My mind is about to explode!
Fever! Fever the mind!!!

Enter the fever forever
Feeding the fever forever

Helpless rage between the worlds
Visions of transformation
Shackled by reincarnation

FEVER THE MIND!!!
