We are the important aspects
That deserve and need attention
We are the empty creatures
Poisoned and infected with desperation
A blank story so bitter to tell
Aborted ability - Only your flesh you can sell

In a heartless mind, where the scars could never heal
In a heartless soul, where the demons take control

Heartless - Failure of the core
Heartless - Nothingmore
Heartless - Nothingness
Heartless - Endless

We are the bulletwhores
That work and reach for a terrorlord
We are the hammertongues
That speak the nail of the neverword
Poisoned and infected with desperation
Aimless bastards reign this dead colonization
Where only your flesh you can sell

In a heartless mind, where the scars could never heal
In a heartless soul, where the demons take control

Heartless - Failure of the core
Heartless - Nothingmore
Heartless - Nothingness
Heartless - Endless

Where only your flesh you can sell

Heartless - Failure of the core

In a heartless world, where the shadows grow
In a heartless sense, where the madness takes control
In a heartless mind, where the scars could never heal
In a heartless soul, where the demons take control
