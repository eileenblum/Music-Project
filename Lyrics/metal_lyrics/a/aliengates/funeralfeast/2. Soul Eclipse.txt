Retribution from the damned
Crowned with scorn
Dead but alive to witness the end
Bounded at suicidedawn
Slaves of the vulture
Killing yourself for vengeance
Burn your mind and start the massacre
Join the legions to declare the final war
And slay - Slay - Slay - Slay
Slay - Slay - Slay - Slay!!!

Slay inside your brain - Crushed by pain
Slay within your dreams - Shattered soul

Bereaved by your light
The light turns your inside into blackest night
The nightside of your soul
Your soul eclipse!

Burn your mind and start the massacre!
Join the legions to declare the final war and...

Slay inside your brain - Crushed by pain
Slay within your dreams - Shattered soul

Bereaved by your light
The light turns my inside into blackest night
The nightside of your soul
Your soul eclipse!
The nightside of your soul... eclipse!
