Misanthropy burns within
Where insanity reigns supreme
Poisonheaven is cursed to bleed
Now the world's lost at my feet

The dead world of the damned

You're creeping to the skies
Concealing all the lies
Your masquerade in rage
Incarnates the work from your hate

The monstrosity of your work
Your work, a seed of hate

Slaughter Gods
Your pandaemonic claws rip so deep
Slaughter Gods
Where apocalyptical generation creep

The monstrosity of your work
Your work, a seed of hate

Slaughter Gods
Your pandaemonic claws rip so deep
Slaughter Gods
Where apocalyptical angels creep

The dead world of the damned
My heart will always bleed!
