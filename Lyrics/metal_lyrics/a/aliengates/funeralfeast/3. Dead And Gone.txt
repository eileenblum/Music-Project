I walk among dead
Reality unfolds in red
Souls fall like rain
Now face the darkest of days
Final genocide way
The price all must pay

Daylight dies
Beginning of the end
Your dream crashes down
The hatework of your dying world

Face the last of dawns
We treat the earth with scorn
Now reap what you've sawn
When all is dead and gone

I am the one shooting at your world
I'm your work... you're betrayed

Face the last of dawns
We treat the earth with scorn
Now reap what you've sawn
All is dead and gone

I am the one!

All is dead and gone
I'm gone!
