Hatework of despair
Mortal pestilence everywhere
We breathe this silent misery
The human disease
... and I...

Can't leave this goddamn shell
This goddamn hell
Come, leave this goddamn shell
This goddamn hell!!!

The Plague inside
The non-divine

All is done - all is dead
... and I...

Can't leave this goddamn shell
This goddamn hell
Come, leave this goddamn shell
This goddamn hell!!!

The Plague inside
The non-divine
