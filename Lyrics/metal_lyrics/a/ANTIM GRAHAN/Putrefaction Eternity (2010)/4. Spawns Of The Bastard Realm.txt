Arise my children
Seeds of I shalt reaped
Sins of I shalt reap
Untamed flames ov hell
Abort thy thoughts ov salvation
Devouring the existence of life
A serpent awaits for thy soul
Children of the darkened void
Awaken under the moonless skies
Screams of silence, I rejoice
Behold
The realm of godless approaches
Children of pestilence
Born in a blistered rotting flesh
Upon the womb of a decayed soul
A maggot fetus, thus come into life
The sickening stench of death.
