Rotting stench of divine hypocrisy
Fragments of lives once subsist
Army of dedicated annihilation
Torment beyond mortal credence
Slaughter, all that thy sight beholds
Remnants, spatter bones
Vile contemplation, murder and rape
Extermination of human race
Blessed by the tyrant, I
Prepare for apocalyptic reign
Inhumane empathy, inhumane soul
This is thy new pestilence breed
Era of malevolence has evolved
Deceased, holy spirits and gods
Forsaken by the creator
Vociferous silence thus evolves
Deafening bare mortal screams
