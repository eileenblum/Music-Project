End of an era has begun
Fragments of shattered conviction lays
Impaled by once mere slave
Bring on the ignorant creed
Memories of infinite dimension decreased
Upon the dust of thy creation
Obstinate the reign of dismay
Elicitation, termination of creation
Kingdom of odium arise
Upon the bastards now I become one
Masters serve the slaves
Chronicles of once what was
Feeble, once the mighty lord
Termination of the abyss of stars
Chronicles of a dying god.
