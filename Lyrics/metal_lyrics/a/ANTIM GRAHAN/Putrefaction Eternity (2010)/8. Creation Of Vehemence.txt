Running through a horde
The only purpose here seems
To hurt everyone that I could see
And all the faces are enemies.
This is just another day
Of one day of my life
I would kill the first one on my sight
With the knife struck in his chest
Here I see all the entrails eject
Blow in the head and ruptured skull
Blood seems so beautiful when it flows
Gasping for the last breath
Buried in his own waste
Another perverted.
