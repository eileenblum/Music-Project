Your end is near
I can sense the fear in your soul
I will imprison your mind
Only eternity to suffer
With pleasure I smirk
When the pain raptures from your throat
Fierce anger is all I have to give
Until the suffering reduce you to ruins
Believe in nothing, have no more faith
The only thing permanent is your misery
This is your pattern of destiny
I will hurt you fatally
First dies your brain, then dies your body
Your soul will beg for
Termination
Extinction
This torment shall never end
