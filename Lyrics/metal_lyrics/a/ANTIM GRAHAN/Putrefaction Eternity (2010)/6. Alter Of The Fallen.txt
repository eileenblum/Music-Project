A mourning star
Upon the darkest of the forest
Where the moonlight fails to pierce
The mighty foliage of the woods
Lightens the pathways of the forgotten
A sanctuary of forsaken angels
Fallen from the kingdom of heavens
Beyond all dreams and hope it now remains
An altar, where they rest
Eternal masters of this place
The land of forever nightfall
Darkness, like a luring melody in the ghostly fog
This land has absorbed obscurity
Yet it lacks not, the presence of grace
Forever lost it shall remain
Into the pages of time
And all it would remain is a myth
Upon deceased mortals decayed mind.
