Diminish thy hope
Kneel before my wrath
Shattered wishes and infinite grief
Welcome to my world order
Breathe to suffer
An eternal torment achieved
Behind the world of perpetual lies I live
Become division of darkened fate
Burned and buried, theory of peace
Resurrected, novel cult obscene
Behold, I am God
With horde of cursed souls
I march into the obscurity
My legion triumphant
Skies bloodied by my fleet
Endless era of terror has begun
Abhorrence shalt forever reign supreme
Assemble the slaves, pitiful human race
Exterminate, plague of innocent breed
Endless epoch, repulsion complete
Thus hallowed by putrefaction eternity.
Unmerciful commandment regime
Obliterate, eliminate, condense
Alliance of Immortals
Pre darkly force
Cremate dust to dust
This is the end
Upon the fire bringer
With vengeance in thy eyes
Fight derange destroy erase
This is the part of my impulse.
