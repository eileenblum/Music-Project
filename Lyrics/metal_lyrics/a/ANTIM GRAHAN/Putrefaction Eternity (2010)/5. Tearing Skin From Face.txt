This face will never be the same
Let me restructure smile
No anesthesia
Only it will ruin the pleasure
A blade in my hand
Never looked so shiny and bright
Masterfully now I engrave
The pieces of your epidermis
A fake face now comes off
This is magnum opus desire
Stratum corneum, Stratum granulosum,
And lo, how delightfully they fall
Into dermis I enter
With fountain of blood
And your pig like squeals
This is such an ecstasy
Reconstruction to a beauty from fake
I squeeze the flesh
Just to see if it still bleeds
Blissful silence and screams no more
A work of genius
And this is my masterpiece
