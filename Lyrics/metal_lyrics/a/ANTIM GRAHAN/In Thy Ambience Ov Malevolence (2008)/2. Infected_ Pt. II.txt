I can't believe that my life has come to this rotting phase
I can't believe that my life has been infected
Once again I've fallen to
Another one of your lies
The dark clouds of my days are over my head
No matter how hard I try
I couldn't get out of here
My life has been spellbound
By only temptations and tears
I have been running hard
To escape this dawn
Because I have been infected
I long to get out of this despair of mine
But the demons living in me never let me retrieve
The sun of my life
Has set away
I have been running hard
Because this down below
I have been infected
Ever growing sadness beholds me
Wounds of thy forsaken love
Beyond the mortal healing
Immured in grimmest sorrow
My soul shall haunt the timeless
These halls now and forever
Deepening abyss of nothingness
As I wait for my gracious death
Infected by thy lies
I have fallen into darkness
Light hurts my visions
Only shadows gives me company
Residing in cold dungeon
Warmth has been forever forgotten
Dragging down the prosaic life
Vengeance is what is seek
I'll watch thou crawling through the grave
Rotting inch by inch
Death shall always be remote
A far from thy demise
As a mirage in rupture
Thy nightmare shall never end
Infected again.
