Beneath the barren hills
Near the roaring sea
Like some deformed form
Of some primeval myth
Carnival of blood begins
Amputated bleeding soul
Fell on the battle ground
Piles of dead body lay
Frozen blood all around
Spears thrusting deep down
In this unholy feast
Vehement of Spartans flared
Masters of swords and spears
Fear they never knew
In masters lingered thirst
Welcomed the grey dawn
Outnumbered and a forlorn hope still exist
But the Spartans defied the relent
The mighty doom's on
Awaiting for the day
One more day to forever enter hell
This is Sparta !!
Immortals laid down on the ground
To the death they were always bound
Death beheld thou no more pain
Death be thy final praise
Ere passed the great Spartans
Resting on their majestic grave
Stirring at the world they lived in
3 days of fortitude
3 days of grace
We are not your fantasy warrior
This is the story of the fortitude
We are, eternally born to fight
Remember this, this is Sparta!
