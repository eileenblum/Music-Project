Winter is here again
With blizzard and the rain
Decaying woods and all
Whispers of the winds
Remains the same
There I lie in silence
Six feet down underground
There I lie in silence
Beneath the bleeding ground
But where I be in
Only blossom thou will know
The blood orchid blooming
Under the blood red winged snow
A veil of blue mist rise
Hiding the glaring sun
Remote and sullen red
It now all remains
Wolves howl in the heathen land
Piercing the sweeping time
There roams the hell
Another rioted flame
Reflection of the silver moon
Shines on the raven pool
Amid the rituals
Summoning of the werewolves
This awaken by winter in you
Amidst these gore and destroy all will face off
You and I
Inside the crystal caves
Crimson eyes gleam
To the temptation of fresh blood
Echoing in the woods
Everything is same here
Old, eternal world
Whatever that's been told
It's nothing but a false
What I've done forever wanted
Right here forever this
Inside here's forlorn writing
Brought here by beast by beast
Right here inside my heartache
Winter blossom of sorrow
Only the grief and thou
After the sun is deformed
