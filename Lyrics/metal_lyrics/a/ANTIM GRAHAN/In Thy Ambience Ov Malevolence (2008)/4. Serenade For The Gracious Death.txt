Within of all dismay of souls
An angel remains apart from all
Forever forsaken, fallen from heaven
Inside these walls of inhuman sorrow
Serenade for the gracious death
The true king rise upon his throne
Nothing remains, everything ends
This is the reign of infernal lord
Through this blooded river she flows
Dreaming of Eden she shall afloat
But she doesn't know
Kingdom of heaven exist no more
Serenade for the gracious death
The true king rise upon his throne
Nothing remains, everything ends
This is the reign of infernal lord
Behold this sight unholy
Where darkness will take over
Surrender to almighty
We are his slave forever
This is like the fallen
We are forever termed to burn
Before the time began
Before the light was born
Fate was already written
Already we were fallen
What he chose to be
For we shall never know
How we fall apart
It's all been decided
Doom is ours once again
We all fall to be united
Escape there is only fall
As I've told neither plotting for
Undefeated, Undaunted
Warrior of mortal shire
Belial fanatical
Welcome to the world of a war and fire
We will lesion not for long
Serenade for the gracious death
This is the ultimate fire, devour
Defying order
Battling in for lives on way
This is mortals end
Serenade for the gracious death
This is eternity
Forever lying to the one who rots away
Could it be now one more
This is my war
This is my end.
