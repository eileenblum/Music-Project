Once upon the darkness
Through the antagonistic grounds
Enter the world of belial
Atrocity thus walks along
Whispering in the cold foggy nights
Lead the thoughts of desolation
As I enter the forest of no return
Rotting inside like the veil of the death
The dreams so appealing my mind goes awry
Feeling the temptation I walk through this path
Voices in me just pulling me apart
Retribution dominion vile thoughts of I
Annihilation dedicated creature of disgrace
Forsaken by the gods, I've no desire
Cursed for eternity, misery would be mine
I saunter the farthest corner
Still I find no end
Wind whispers in my ears
Mortifying my credence
Enter the forest where darkness dwells
Enter the forest where bereavement reigns
As I walk the darkened path to hell
Walking the dead, day is denied
Deserted mind and mind's off to haul
Destined to fire, a nemesis
A cold logway to the road of hell
All men to go, all men to die
I have to go and I can't deny
Eternal pain I'm going to be in
I got to forgive this, spirit down life forever
Walking this path of ever sorrow
Set square I did not join
Forest of unforgiven
Angels and eternal dismay
Enter the demons
Invading blooded skies
Behold destiny
Horror performed on their shores
Ravaging angels
From where the shadow revolts
Return back in disguise
About of all to fall
Be there two stars
United for the fall
Be there sick of souls
Excited by thy demise
See for life embowel
Like though its gone to foul
Remember, the hoar of the treason
United in this war
From where within this power
Eternal kingdom be
Worth be within your soul
Behold the angels fallen
Fallen from their grace
Behold the almighty
Thy mighty will not meet the horde
Suffering forever
Angels and their demise
Remain by the choice
This be eternal war
Eternal dismay
