Unleash these chains
You've bound me in
The blood thirsty spirits
Seek me once again
I feel them in the winds
Like a nimbus they sail
Towards me and I choose
And I choose to resurrect
And I choose to live again

Follow my thoughts
I'll take you there
Past the restless shadows of the dead
To the grey mourning kingdom
Like a nimbus they sail
Towards me and I choose
And I choose to resurrect
And I choose to live again

Darkness reigns this landmark
Never my world would let it go
For my friend, let it go
We are in it centuries of cold
For my pain that burns
Everytime we're into no mean

To get inside this widows coven
You got to know there will be no question
Long life but die tonight
It's the grey mourning kingdom
Why run it's the winter divine
Would you pray on my dying kingdom
Thy suffer always with thee
Inside this rebel reborn

Everytime one at a time
Time and time, running one at a time
Running to be the shine tonight
I am the shine for you

Oh my desire, burning desire
Let them die, die and lie
Burning mass, let them die
Never teach on my desire

The reaper rise
The veil lies beside
As far horror goes
This is my demise

Darkness reigns, the lands sanctity raped long before
Just as far this vengeance goes
They'll fail till they dethrone

These tales untold
These tales unspoken
Secrets never unfold

Darkness reigns, the land was burned long before
Cursed by those immortals, the city of dark
Where now I belong
This'll be the end of all
By the time they'll build upon their kingdom
Forlorn heart
Grey mourning kingdom
Suffer my pain
Grey mourning kingdom
Forever dark,blooded all desire
