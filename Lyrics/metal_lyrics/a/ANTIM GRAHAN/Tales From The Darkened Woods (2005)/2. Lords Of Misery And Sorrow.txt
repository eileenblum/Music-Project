I am the lords of misery and sorrow
Forever my slave
I am the Lords of misery and sorrow
Forever this pain
I am the lords of misery and sorrow
This is the end
I am the lords of misery and sorrow
This is thy demise

Raging from the grave
The vengeance shall be taken
Immortal, I am the forever warrior
Of The Eternal cold

Created by thy imperfect God
I've failed to redeem my sanctity
Forever more the reason to die
Vengeance forever in mind
Without you it's death that all it counts
I am the lords of sorrow and misery

I want to go
Take my hand to eternal land
Shadowed by with infernal cold
No addiction to reded so bold
I am in infernal desert
Forever thy lord

Take my hand, I'll take you there
I shall be protecting all of your land
And the want forever this is
Without your god you never desire
But I am forever fire
So forever me forever you
what seen there's just no god
I mean to open up thy eyes
Forever me forever you

I am the lords of misery and sorrow
Forever my slave
I am the Lords of misery and sorrow
Forever this pain
