My eyes aches to see thee
My arms aches to embrace thee
I cannot bear this anymore, this torture
I sense no pain
An illusion it still feels
That I struggle in, to survive

Burn my soul
I see no reason to live
Death is no longer painful
And I summon upon it
Rip my soul, I see no purpose to breath

Scathed is my skin
The wounds more worsening each day
I am fading away in infernal dark
Inside the dead of dawn forming my demise
What I feel would be just her demise

In the prison I've walled myself in
Inside the circle what could be destined
So be it the circle to rise mine
Thus inside my dead soul
Forever my desire, her demise stopped this life
A bit of forlorn mountain
Inside this life unborn

Her demise

I just feel that we died to fill void
This is my demise cause of you
Despite all of thy turning sides in you
Don't bring your dead inside forever lies
Thy demise
