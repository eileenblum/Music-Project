Like never ending pain
The frost of misery
Has taken over my life

Besides the fountains of deep
The vengeance shall be taken chill on forever
Like the night that never belight
This forest shall never enlight

Like the virgin forest that whisper to thee
Darkest of the night that shall never be day
Like the wolf that shiver in snow
Blood moon stars they howl above

Forever bless the winter
The seasons of the pain
Always eternal and so are my pain

Forever winter

Enter the nightmare insane like we are
Behold angel they all eternally want divinity
Never see what you ever want to get through your soul
Never come just learn demise
Angels burn like immortal flame
Return to the seasons of the dead
Always, forever winter.
