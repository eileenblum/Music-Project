I can't believe that my life has come to this rotting phase
I can't believe that my life has been infected
Once again I've fallen to
Another one of your lies

The dark clouds of my days are over my head
No matter how hard i try i couldn't get out of here
My life has been spellbound by only temptations and tears
I've been running hard to escape this pain
Cause I've been infected

I long to get out of this despair of mine
But the demons living in me never let me retrieve
The sun of my life has set away
Now all thou can see is my forlorn soul
Since I've been infected

Never did i get thy forewarn harm
It headed straight towards my soul
Alone and cold, no hope in my sight
Only grim world pushing me behind
My sunken mind, dazed and blind
Saw only thy lie, that fool was me

As i watch my doom in your eyes
I will nod my head and you will just say die
I forsake thy thought and thy god
Sin is you and that is all i know
Trust in you was my biggest mistake
Like creature of extreme disgust
I am that fading scream that died at last
