My tale of betrayal continues to rewrite itself.
This reflection unknown, redemption overthrown.
The unspoken testimony. Just a story for the fallen, oh onward!
I have something to prove to all of you! This is something I believe in. I will never stop until you understand.
Welcome to the lions' den!
Farewell, to the faint of heart. With the voice of a plague I will ravage your
cities and flood the earth.
Devour nations I built below. Under my name you will plea in vain.
Under seven seas, and over seven continents, seven ways to escape salvation!
With a nihilistic virtue uncontained, their voyage forged straight to the grave.
We're all bound by the burial. 
Why pillage? Surrender! 
You'll swim to the shore and embrace the aurora that guides you home.
Shall we waltz?  Shall we waltz to this sweet symphony?
And you will swim
To the shore. Embrace the aurora that guides you home. Our fate obscure, so seize the day and remember...
