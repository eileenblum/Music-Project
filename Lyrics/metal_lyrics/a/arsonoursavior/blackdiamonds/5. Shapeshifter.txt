In the deepening twilight, a burning witch has come to my manor.
She whispers in tongues.
Murmuring deeds of the dead.
With ghost servants and royal roots, to be raised like a wolf.
I am without the all seeing eye.
I am the killer beneath the reflections.
The heir of crumbling crowns in this tyrant's sovereignty.
Forever calloused, cursed, and condemned it's come to be.
The light of the moon shimmering through my plagued anatomy.
Becoming bloodthirsty!
The flesh fills up these rotting walls of amour.
Romance what's inside (Oh yeah!)  before their tusks feed the lies.
Yeah!
Get the fuck out of my head these voices never surrender.
Get the fuck out of my head these voices never surrender.
No remorse, no compassion, no control.
Eternity.
You think you know what this like?
To prey on the fairest one of them all.
Uh!
November tides and ruptured skies forecast my future.
I'll spend this solstice in a silent slumber.
