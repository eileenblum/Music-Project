Welcome to my world...
I once had touch with. 
The tree roots are strangling me from beneath.
My eyes are bulging, seeing the world that's destroyed.
From the book of stone and  between-
Between the lines of time.
From the book of stone.
I am timeless.  I await.  I await!
Mind of gears, soul of rust, a heart that never seems to combust.
Like a robotic man, walking in meaningless cycles.
Repeating, repeating, repeating...
Somewhere twisted in the wreckage, I am searching for whatâs left of me.
When all tales of romance and serenades worth singing for cease.
All is lost, I am lost! Someone find me.
Someone understand me!
I begin to walk the endless abyss, drifting through the forest we once roamed.
I, the last crowned monarch, thrown to the gallows amongst the willows to blow
through the leaves.
And be forgotten in time!
And so this lonesome ghost shall never love again.
