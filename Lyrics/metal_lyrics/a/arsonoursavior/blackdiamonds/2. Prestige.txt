Eyes revolted by the massacre.
A feat cursed by the barbaric thieves of evermore.
Silence!
Our heads filled with the tales of triumph.
With the mask of arrogance and lustful pride.
It makes no sense, but we carry on!
We're all sure signs of ignorant bastards.
Oh god, what have I gotten myself into? Trinity, trinity, holy trinity. 
Fill these lungs with the songs that will make our world listen.
Fill these lungs with the songs that will make our world listen.
Keep this world afloat.
Keep this world afloat.
Sinking!
An armor of shame.
A sword of ignorance.
This place, peculiar, no residence of my dynasty.
An armor of shame.
A sword of ignorance.
The saints feather me in holy glory.
This hell will forever fear me.
So here we are on top of the world, awaiting our dreams to fall right down your
fucking face!
You think you know who I am. You don't even know my name.
I can't be everything that you want me to be.
I can't be everything that you want me to be.
Trust is something I don't understand.
Trust is something I don't understand. 
I'll never stand beside another hollow pawn.
