Dark skies and Iâm drowning in the flood again. Endless affliction sent to torture my soul.
Why does this misery follow me? Why canât I escape this pain?
Drill another hole through my skull. Release another demon.
Take any length to pass the blame. Responsibility - washed my hands clean.
Demons in the night? Self-righteous perception. Defensively, I hide blind in the shadows.
Misery cuts deep and yet my innocent hands hold the blood soaked knife.
Every action leads to reaction, every choice to a consequence.
Foolish decisions yield a price to pay. Pass the blame and yet the debt remains.
Wipe the scales from my eyes that I might gain clarity of sight.
With a new perspective I take ownership of my actions, the impending flood now seems a healthy rain.
Pain is inevitable but misery is optional.
Suffering and pain will fade away as hope lives on and love remains.
