Purity defiled by the denial of hallowed intentions, the continual pursuance of ultimate control.
Unconscious ignorance feeding convenience, stemming from the intentional self-deception of rational thought.
Psalm 36
Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in their hearts; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
For they flatter themselves in their own eyes that their iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
The words of their mouths are mischief and deceit; they have ceased to act wisely and they do not reject evil.
Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
All people may take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see.
O continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your salvation to the upright of heart!
Do not let the foot of pride overtake me, or the hand of the wicked drive me away.
There lie the workers of iniquity fallen; they are thrust down, unable to rise.
