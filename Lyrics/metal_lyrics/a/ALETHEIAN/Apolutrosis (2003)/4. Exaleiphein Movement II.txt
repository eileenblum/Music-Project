â¦Sifting through the charred remains of self-fulfillment, fruitless efforts to appease an intangible yearning.
Standing on the brink of death, petitioning the value of this pallid life.
âWhat is there that is left to live for? This all consuming feeling that thereâs something more?â
An internal vacuum; frozen desperate, lonely. Waiting to be filled by the breath of life.
Ingrained desire for completion, imprinted in creation, the hand print of design.
Restoration awaits a desire to seek; an openness to embrace the intended fulfillment, willingness to relinquish the shackles of betrayal, to cast off the chains of self-imprisonment.
Living water will quench the intangible thirst (never too thirst again), calm the churning tides, still the tempest, and part the seas.
Delivering a drowning man to solid land.
Divine compassion lies in wait for the opportunity to bring restitution.
The hand of wrath, empowered to serve justice in light of the defiling of truth, has been stayed by the deliberate had of mercy.
The debt was channeled through mortal pain and death, once through one, the risen one, once and for all, for the restoring of all.
Pervasive grace pierces through darkness revealing light.
All that remains is a step in faith, to make a choice.
âFor too long Iâve entertained these lies. Self reliance has blinded my sight.â
âAs I turn my eyes towards the fire, a voice beckons to me as I cry.â
âRelinquish fear, you no longer must hide. Let this Fire, within you reside.â
âTempering the fortitude of life, annealing power of light be glorified.â
