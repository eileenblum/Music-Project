Churning in these tempest tides, ebbing towards decay. Foundations desecrated by impiety.
Languished, forlorn, unable to maintain. Encompassed by despondency.
âIâm drowning. My toils proving vain. Darkness swallowing my will to breath, Iâm gaspingâ
Labored cries reflect the failure of an ingrown life.
Enslaved to the nature of contradiction, controlled by desires that subvert hallowed intention.
Enveloped in incompletion, void, barren, destitute.
âThis emptiness within me leaves me ever searching.â
Yearning for purpose and contentment, striving to supplement the pervading depravity.
âSenseless, my lifeâs lost in shadow. Failure to see beyond the ashes.â
Downward spiral of insignificance masked by escapist indulgence in impropriety.
Despair abated by over stimulation of momentary pleasure.
Willful furtherance of eternal separation.
