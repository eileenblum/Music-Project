May the peace of God, which passes all understanding, go with you.
There is great power that makes all things new, the blood of the eternal covenant through which God raised the Lord Christ Jesus from death.
Therefore, give honor, thanks, and praise to the glory of the Father and the Son.
Go forth in the certainty of faith, in the knowledge of love, and in the vision of hope; and may God work in you what is pleasing to Him, through Christ Jesus, to whom be the glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
