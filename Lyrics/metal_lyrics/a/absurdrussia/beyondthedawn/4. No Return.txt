Where blow cold winds
Embracin' mountain tops
Where rivers flow into seas
I dragin' alone

Emotions transpire
Shadows above
Voices are whisperin' me
Tears from my eyes

Struggle with no one
Nothing to lose
Dawn succeed the sunset
Day turns into night

Summon attracts me
I walk to eternity
Grief my fellow-traveller
Forgotten past

That's what I need is
That's what I searching for
Everything else to nowhere

No return from the wasteland
Forever
Take me away
By the path of frustration
Soon I'll be there
