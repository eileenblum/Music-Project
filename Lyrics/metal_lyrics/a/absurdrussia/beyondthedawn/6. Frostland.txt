Winter on unbounded space
Snowy rug covered the ground
Birds are long since fly away
Dim firmament wrapped in clouds

Foliage. ve already fell off
Left to lie under the snow
Slender branches stretched to the sky
Dismal trees shiver with cold

As soon as triangles of fir - trees
Stay enveloped of white wreath

Dense wood impassible and strong
Stick up reveal boles

Sadness bursting in to my heart
Grieve for the past, depressive state
Severe thoughts gnaw from inside
Future at the shroud of haze

Twilight comes - I. m shrouded by dusk
Cold of evening will ensnare
Snow - flakes as tears from eyes
Ward off beams of withdrawal day

Piercing wind blows in to my face
Bites a skin and watering eyes
Locked by frost, all strengths have drained
Severe cold sank to the ground

Lonely raven is soaring in height
Black bird prophecies my fate

Silence reigns, creak of trees
Blow away by howling wind
