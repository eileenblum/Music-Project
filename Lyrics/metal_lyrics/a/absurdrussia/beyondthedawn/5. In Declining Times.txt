Surrounded by disquiet
Call from depth of soul
Flare up an utter battle
A storm coming from North
Clouds come to blows
Fighting till the death
Approaching fear
Wipe off memories

Heaven opens wide
Vortexes gathered at once
Every cloud form up
Of a martial host
In the sky, on the ground
Frenzied wind, thunder. s roar
Everywhere raging &amp; droning
Bright like day shafts abroad

Breams of clouds stand on end
Water streams and sheaves of fire
Symbols of the commencement
Fall upon a sinful ground

Spirits of the night
Celebrating wedding
Winds are whistling melodies
For their eerie dances
Lost among a routine
Experience trampled in filth
Might of false and flattery
Revive inferior dreams

Final symphony of sounds
Proclaims downfall of the world
Burning hot temptation. s thorns
Thrust remains of abandoned soul
Falling through the emptiness
From enormous crag of reverie
Blinded by a pitch darkness
Disappeared in yawning abyss

Heaven battle flare up
Everything around screaming
Drawing near a great wrath
It. s reflection - inner fear
