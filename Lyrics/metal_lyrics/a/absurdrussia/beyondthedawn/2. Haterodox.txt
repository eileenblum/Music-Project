Life is persecuted
Infinited insanity
Pass through the tortures
Feel sweet neverending pain

Abstract existence
Press of the fear
Morbid soul is disconnected
Two-faced idols
Ambiguous words
Guinea-pig in experiment

Compromise - transaction with a conscience
Total profanation is prevailing
Heterodox

Struggle with dissent
Conduct is under control
Truth is just the only one
Falsity dictates proviso

Brutal reprisal
Assault is the best defence
Reality gives birth to pest
One against all
In exposed lies
Stand to gain or will be dead
