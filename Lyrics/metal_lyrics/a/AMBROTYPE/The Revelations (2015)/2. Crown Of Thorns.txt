Embrace the fact that there's a lack from signs of being in my eyes
The voice of a lover fades from earth as I rise to heaven
Men will die, kings will cry, pale skin blinds my eyes tonight

There I rest rotting on the ground in silence
Shaking from this terror I feel
Melting down, leaking through the splinters in the ground
Then finally departing this life

Runaway from your misery
Runaway from your memories
Runaway with me
Thorns cutting through my hide, blood streaming down my face
I reached the surface and smelled your body mist
Then fade away
Then fade away

Come and slay my agony
Rebel against this tyranny
Rip my skin and flesh with bare hands

Angels come and take your loan
Slit my throat, break my bones
Then put on the crown of thorns

Name the quest and I shall rise again... beside my grave
Name the quest and see me fall down again... in your hell
