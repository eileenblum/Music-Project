I wait here for you, on the edge of the mountain
Break the chains and run to me, as you promised

Run before their arrival
Don't you drift into endlessness and join the others

With lies you faced me you never knew what's coming
The mountains are lit no more
But now it's too late for you to be delivered
You've give up your soul

Where will you hide, my darling, as the sun devours the earth?
Your face burns and I collapse, I'm broken, I'm broken,

And I cry as I watch you burn
Your vivid soul is gone with the bitter waves

With lies you faced me you never knew what's coming
The mountains are lit no more
But now it's too late for you to be delivered
You've give up your soul

Desperation is denouement, it tears me apart
The end is here I weep for you, evermore

Run before their arrival
I know you failed
But I still see you there
