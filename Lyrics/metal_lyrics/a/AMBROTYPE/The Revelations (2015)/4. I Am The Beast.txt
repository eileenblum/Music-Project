Slay the people
Burn what's left and laugh at us
Your words are fickle
You rage and fail and tear the dust
The tide is coming
Resistance finally arrived

Joyous fire burning in my eyes
Raves carry out my hymn of demise

Hail your master
Purge the earth and kneel for no one
Leak the fire
Their crypts are meant to burn everlong

Soon I will find myself in your eyes
Soon I will break the curse of a thousand lies
I embrace the darkness, and I destroy everything I love
What have I done? How did I turn my world around?
There's no coming back from this. It's over

My resurrection is complete, there's no time for repentance
Wounds are the path for my soul to leap, and gush down with my senses
Your promised you would come. You liar, liar, liar, liar,
All we had is nothing but pale dreams, floating in poisoned faith

Die in my fire
Shed the pain away
Dream of retribution
You'll never... never feel the rain

I am the beast
666
I am your failure
And my hate gleams

The mist of trust around my eyes merges with the colors of despair.
The crust of my solitude shudders a silhouette of her presence.
