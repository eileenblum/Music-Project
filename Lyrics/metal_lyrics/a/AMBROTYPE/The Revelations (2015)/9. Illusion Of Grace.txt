Winter has come
The clouds are gathered
The sunshine no more
My soul is battered

This mass of dismay
Traps me behind
She tool it all away
And left me blind

Go away, my love
Go away, my pain
My soul will heal in darkness

Go away, my love
Go away, my pain
My soul will heal under pale skin

Illusion of grace
Illusion of your face
