She grows from my hands like a tree
Wilted and never free
Black flames overcome her brain
Blood pours down her corpse and veins

She lies there burning
She lies there aching
Flowers pound her with thorns
Once again she dies alone

And I became the cancer in your brain
And I became the poison in your veins
And I became the voices you cannot tame
And I became death beg to claim

She died a million times
She beckoned for his forgiveness
Her final death came to be
And now she rests down beneath

Eyes dripping unpolluted odium
Beasts teeming all around
Ashes of women sprinkling across the flames
Beneath them God is concealing her remains

Searing breeze
Whips her body
Knocks her down again and again

Pealing skin
Fuming flesh
We all have gone insane
