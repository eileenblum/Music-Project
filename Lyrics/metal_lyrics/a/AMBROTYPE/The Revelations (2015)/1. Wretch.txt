If feels so strange
To lose your faith
It's time for my escape
It's time to sail away

Dream of me
Oh, darling, hear me
Don't you say a thing
Come sail away with me
And give up your faith

Dream of me

Why did you pray
And break your promise?
Why did you stay
And spin my astray?

Dream of me
Dream of me
