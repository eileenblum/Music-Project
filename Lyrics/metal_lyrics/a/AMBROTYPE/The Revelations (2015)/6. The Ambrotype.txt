The bitter tides
Slithering demise
The fear you sigh
Traps your frail soul in pale light

Soon the lies we once believed will be the cradle to salvation
Our desolation will mark their monuments

Liar! We're coming for you
Your final hour is nigh
Millions of demons gather tonight
To tear open the ambrotype

Spread your black wings and dress the skies
Inject the fear and watch him cry
Shine your darkness feed your lust
Flames to flames, dust to dust

Paradise is withered and empty
Spitting onto your souls and memories
Time is ending breath is running out
There's no escape, no place to veil the crowds

Flickering wrath of shadows
Wipes out what's been done
Tyrants at the gallows
My demons have won

Above the sky
Heathen your faith is denied
The bitter tides
Slithering demise
The fear you sigh
Traps your frail soul in pale light

I know I am deranged, but you're the reason
Compromised everything for you
