Rest now, little brother
I know you're waiting above
I have prayed in silence
To see you in a dream one last time

Your weak helpless moans
Echo through my heart
I grow to release all this pain trapped inside

I linger through the hills of fire
To come across your orchard
Close your eyes. There's no consolation
Don't you weep for me. I have to go

Father, let go. He's not breathing
Scared in the corner died alone
