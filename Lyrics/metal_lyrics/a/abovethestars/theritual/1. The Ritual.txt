Priestess is dancing...
Yog-Sothoth is waiting
For a victim
Is lying on the altar
And she's still breathing

Open this 'treasure' chest
Cut her from throat to breasts
Make sure she's still alive
Under the pale moonlight

Under the training blood
Pray to the Outer God
Children of the Unknown
Soon they will be reborn

'Open the gates
Oh Yog-Sothoth iÃ¤! Hail!
Please let them in
They shall break through again!'

Priestess is singing...
Her Ritual is close to an end.
The thunder is roaring,
Sky's mourning
The light is fading

Open this 'treasure' chest
Cut her from throat to breasts
Make sure she's dead in time
... the bell will start to chime

Under the training blood
Pray to the Outer God
Children of the Unknown
Soon they will be reborn

'Open the gates
Oh Yog-Sothoth iÃ¤! Hail!
Please let them in
They shall break through again!'
