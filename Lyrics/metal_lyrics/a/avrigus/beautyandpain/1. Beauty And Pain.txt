Deep in the night, it came to me
Torturing silently
Try; but I cant seem to ever break free
From what is haunting me

Deep paranoia
It tears apart my heart
But in my soul
It's all I've ever known

I cut all of the hate I feel
My blood shed and revealed
All that has been wrong with me
The more I feel; the more I ache
I cant go back
I fear more of life's beauty than pain

Thought's wouldn't stop playing upon my mind
Taunting me with what I'd find
Try; but I cant seem to ever break free
From what is haunting me

Deep paranoia
It tears apart my heart
But in my soul
It's all I've ever known

I cut all of the hate I feel
My blood shed and revealed
All that has been wrong with me
The more i need; the more I take
I cant go back
I fear more of life's beauty than pain

Once I believed
And I'd dream of a place
Where the weight of it all
Couldn't harm me
Now I know and I feel
This could never be real
On this path I walk alone

I cut all of the hate I feel
My blood shed and revealed
All that has been wrong with me
The more I see; the more I hate
I cant go back
I fear more of life's beauty than 
All of the hate I feel
My blood shed and revealed
All that has been wrong with me
The more I breathe, the more I break
I cant go back
I feel all of life's beauty and pain
