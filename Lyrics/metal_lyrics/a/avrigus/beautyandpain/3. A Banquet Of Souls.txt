Heathen soul, shameless crime
Stealing souls lost in the night
For your sins you shall die
Farewell Dark One!

Cast below from up high
Leading souls found in the night
For your deeds you shall arise
Welcome Dark One!

Come to me fallen ones
Your day of judgment has come!
Waves of hate, seas of fire
Join my banquet of souls!

Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive my heathen soul

Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord oh please redeem my soul!
