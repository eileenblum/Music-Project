If I must dance in doom and gloom in the hanging tree
As I await at the gates of hades
My saviour to come with the key
(As twilight fades at the gates of hades my saviour will come with the key)
To unleash my unspent fury,
To set my demons free and to grant me just one finalwish before I cease to be...
Then I to the skies shall lift mine eyes with this unspoken plea:
"I wish, I wish, with all my heart that I shall hang with thee."
