When the fires of Hell have burned to the core,
And evil deads are done no more,
Then the Earth shall heave with a mighty roar,
As angles of death to Heaven shall soar.

Great shadows shall fall as one by one
Dark angels wings eclipse the sun.

Salvaging truth
from the wake of their lies,
Stealing their thunder
from the gods and the wise.

All hail!  All hail!
As dark archangels rise.
