When darkness falls the dead shall rise
To resurrect thy reason,
Then they shall pray for one more day
To flower out-of-season.

O rasie me from my watry graves,
This vale of tears illusion,
With one more kiss,
O earthly bliss
Of thy sweet blood infusion!

So, sacred to the memory
Of hearts entwined in flight,
And true shall we forever be,
Till death do us unite.
