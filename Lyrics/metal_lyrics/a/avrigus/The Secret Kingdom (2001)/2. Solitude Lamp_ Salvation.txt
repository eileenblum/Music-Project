I am the silence that enshrouds thee
in moments of deep contemplation of loss,
And in sadness it is I who enfolds thee
in a mantle of darkness,
It is I who olds thee, who smother thy madness
It is I who lies in the tomb and dies with thee...

And when I descend into thy broken dreams thy vision to mend,
I hear thy silent screams,
Bring me thy broken dreams,
I hear thy silent screams,
I'll mend thy broken dreams.
