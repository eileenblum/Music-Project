Suffocation of the land that gave us birth.
Soul strangulation. If there is no will, there is no hurt.
Endless mind corruption. Endless ways to keep us numb.
A million ways keep us down another million to keep us dumb.

These are the ways that will burry us all.
There is no turning back.
Mass consumption has taken its toll.
WE SOLD OUT.

Destruction! Its all a part of our game.
Consumption! Who will be the first of us to take the blame?
Resurrection of old ways that failed the test.
Another public election rigged by the ones who knows our best.

These are the ways that will burry us all.
There is no turning back. WE SOLD OUT.

These are the ways that will burry us all.
Everything turning black. WE SOLD OUT.
