LetÂ´s go!

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
No price to high just to clear your name.
A push a shove no insult to small.
If not avenged it will bring you shame.

That look in your eyes.
All the hate all the lies.
Vengeance prevail.
You fail.

You talk of respect as you knew what it meant.
But to you itÂ´s just another word.
Blood for blood the language you speak
The only way you know to make yourself herd.

The look in your eyes.
The hate THE LIES.
Vengeance prevail.
YOU FAIL.
