All these threats....

All these threats filled with empty words.
They put you way far out of line.
Now you better step up or just step right back.
Cause you will need more than your words toâ¦.

Bring me down [x3]
You canÂ´t bring me down.

(Down) to your level I will never sink.
But you pushed me way to far.
Now the time has come to set things straight.
This time you will need more than words toâ¦

All these empty threats of yours, all these empty words.
All the times youÂ´v crossed the line. All times you tried to drag meâ¦.. down.

All these empty threats of yours, all these empty words canÂ´t bring me down.

You canÂ´t BRING ME DOWN.
You wonÂ´t BRING ME DOWN.
