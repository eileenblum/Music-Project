You think lifeÂ´s hard, you struggle some time.
Turning inwards to get some peace of mind.
Victim of your self-righteous ways.
Your going down.
Is this how youÂ´ll end your days?

Marching the path of the damned
ItÂ´s your own blood on your hands
Marching the path of the damned
.......

You blame the world but its all in your head.
Wake up and face it cause soon youÂ´r dead.
TimeÂ´s up. Act before its too late.
ItÂ´s now or never. Turn your back on this pointless hate.

You blame the world but its all in your head
Its time to wake up cause SOON YOUR DEAD
Its your own blood that you got on your hands
Now when your walking down the PATH OF THE DAMNED
