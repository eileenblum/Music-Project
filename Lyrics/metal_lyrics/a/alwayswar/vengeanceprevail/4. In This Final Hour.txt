You bow down, and face the ground. And you ask your self.
What will become of this hate?
You realize the need to save this world, but letÂ´s face the facts.
ItÂ´s all ready to late.
You look around for another way, in this final hour in this final day.
No! ThereÂ´s no get away. Now the time has come fore us all to pay.

In this final hour.

No way we can win this fight.
ItÂ´s got to end, and letÂ´s end it to night!
TimeÂ´s here to raise the stakes.
We have to do what ever it takes.

Strapped down, gagged and bound. So letÂ´s ask our selves.
Is this really our fate?
While our bridges burn and every thing Is too late.
We lost ourselves in this endless world of hate.

In this final hour.
In this final day.

In this final hour, WE PAY.
In this final day, WE PAY.
In this final hour, WE PAY.
We pay.
