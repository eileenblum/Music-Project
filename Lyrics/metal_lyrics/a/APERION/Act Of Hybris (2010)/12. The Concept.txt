The seed lies underground
Waiting to rise
It`s time for something new
Break down, break down your wall

Find calm place now
Make weak stem grow
Dark shade â blind eyes
Dry land â your cries

Aaaa..

Only this time
You have one life
One solution
Use it wisely now

In silence â uncover â the truth â closer
And sun light â shows the way 
You`ll find safe home

The seed lies underground
Waiting to rise
It`s time for something new
Break down, break down your wall

Free from the insane world
Welcome, welcome back home
