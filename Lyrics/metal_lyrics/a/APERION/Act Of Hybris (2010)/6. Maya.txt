Believe the thoughts and words ment for you
No more hiding from yourself
Even the past ignites something new
But for you

No pain means no love

Turn away from disguise
Don`t let the world full you again
Know who you are before someone else
Tells you to be 
What they want to see

Now, who`s to blame 
I know we`ll stay the same
When I change your name

Don`t lose yourself in lies
Accept all that exists

Turn away from disguise
Aaa
Forever ever 
Let us be
