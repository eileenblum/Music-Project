Sky opens wide â after life â paradise
Waters of earth â covered with flames
Time is burned

You start to see it â what we`ve become
Careless creatures
Hiding in the dark from sun

When we`ll see it
We`re disappearing
New lies cover our eyes

Deep inside â I know we still can find
We`re all divine
The mind must now awake 
Forget the lost mistake
The one we should not make

If thunder strikes
And flaming raindrops
Are falling from the sky
The rain will never dry

Blood competitions 
And careless decisions
By praising this nonsense
Our soul slowly dies

Light â from heaven â do we deserve
Light â to follow â and to preserve
Light â from heaven â away from things
Light â fallow â we lose our wings
