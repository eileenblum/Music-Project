Sleeping, sorrow
Hold me back to regret my past
Just want to break free
One step, one thought
Subconscious voice of reality
My mind telling me

I`m tearing my soul into two, not now
Like an angel, Iâll fall into

Shine my way 
As light knows my name
As time feels the same
And mind fades away
Try to stray
But the vision` too bright
I`m not waiting for you
To bring me back to life
Raising my arms into freedom
Emptying my mind from the fear
I`m taking my life as it is
Right now

Shine my way 
As light knows my name
As time feals the same
And mind fades away
Try to stray
But the vision` too bright
I`m not waiting for you
To bring me back

Tonight
This feeling no longer the same
My mind just fly
On path for freedom
Heart
Which always circles your mind
Still waiting for you
To challenge my own pride

Fading away from the sorrow
I see the light shine in me
I`m painting a new world today
Right now
