Fighting, restless, for some freedom
Dream is endless, mind full, collision

Where now, don`t know, it`s vague vision
Don`t let others make your decision

Force of life within you leads the way
New tomorrow feeds bleak yesterday
Standing still now breads the mole inside
These heavy wings just wonât let you fly
Lost and week can`t find the love you seek
So now it`s time to change!

Believe in your own wisdom
It heals you, brings you freedom
Don`t be so slow in action
Don`t hesitate to question
Be peaceful and courageous
Be humble and contagious
Life is in fact a pleasure
Your question has an answer

Morning, sunrise, saves all, clear skies
Now it`s time to, drop all, true lies
Fly now, take off, fly now, time is now!
