Walking on the same streets every night
Moving in circles
I'm waiting for you
Living in mistakes inside his prison without walls

Throught the old time's toad
In the wrong way of destiny
I'm waking up...
Between the walls that I build myself

I'm the man you've never met
On Your Waiting on the other side of the door
This child you see in my eyes
Is just a mirror

Simple memories for me are too much
Like your smeel that exhales the untouch
I went beyond
And For the sin I'm bleeding

I close my eyes
I see two fallen angels burning in despair
You and I
So close and so far away
I'm arrest by desire
That mould me in ashes without renew
This is my sacrifice!
Too beyond that it should be

My tears confusing with the rain
You don't understand my feeling
Feel myself everywhere
Except inside of you

Ruddy sky reflected on innocent eyes
Emerald eyes
That I'll never forget
I'll never forget

But I'm lost inside four walls
Under me a nymph without a soul
The same emerald eyes
But there is not any gleam
The same wound behind our eyes
We are too much young to die
I've never imagine
That our ruins come from love

I close my eyes
I see two fallen angels burning in despair
You and I
So close and so far away
I'm arrest by desire
That mould me in ashes without renew
This is my sacrifice!
Too beyond that it should be

Save me from the chains of pain
Your shadows still traces my bed
I'm losing myself
And I can hear you say:
you're going away
can't return to the beggining
Don't you understand?

Close your eyes
I'm just a fallen angel burning in despair!
Live or die
In your absence is simple detail for me
Close your eyes!!
I'm just a fallen angel, now you can see me?
Sacrifice!
That someday you'll understand, but will be too late...
