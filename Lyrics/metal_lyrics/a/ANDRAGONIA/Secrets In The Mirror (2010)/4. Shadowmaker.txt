Proving my hate inside of a apocalyptic chaos
Facing the evil that doesn't show his face

Evil power
Keeping hopes
Faking reasons
Hidding on the shadows of god
Through eternal lies seeking salvation
Fobidden roads meeting the hug of pain
A lake of tears where history ends
Eternal fantasy, eternal tragedy

Welcome the land where sun is born without life
Creating hate blood sprouting on the promisse land

The gold lights dim the justices eyes
You keep millions of blind souls seeking for the light
Creating your shadows creating your kingdom murder of dawn
Selling us the cure

Through eternal lies seeking salvation
Forbidden roads meeting the hug of pain
A lake of tears where history ends
Eternal fantasy, eternal tragedy

"Behind the sun is my place, oh, my freedom, my salvation"

It's terrify,
The evil minded spreads it's seeds inside our hearts
We're on our knees to the grace of false rescuer
Pay the price or die

Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker
Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker
Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker
Through the ashes, through eternal life - shadowmaker

Through eternal lies seeking salvation
Forbidden roads meeting the hug of pain
Surrender when life is fading away
Eternal fantasy, eternal tragedy!
