It's just anotyher day
But I've still got the same questions
I think this quest for myself will go on forever

I'm tired of this never-ending blues
It's time to put some colors back to my life

I see the world through my stoned and crying eyes
Everytime I hold my face I feel my skin is cold
I search for the sun to shed it'd light on me
I see no light there, I feel no life in me...

I know it's all just the way I see the life
Show me the way to believe again!!

The light will warm me and make me open my eyes
So I'll see that I could be... Alive again!!!
It's hard way to realize life still goes on
I don't know how to run from this state of mind!

I'm tire of this never-ending blues
I'm lost and alone, in Company Of Silence

I see the world through my stoned and crying eyes
Everytime I hold my face I feel my skin is cold
I search for the sun to shed it'd light on me
I see no light there, I feel no life in me!
