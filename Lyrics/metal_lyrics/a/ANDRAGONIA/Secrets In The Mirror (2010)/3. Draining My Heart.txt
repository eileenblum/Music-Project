What's going on?
Unnamed feeling are emerging
It's like waking up from a dream
In which lucidity kisses madness on the lips

Instincts crawl under skin
Dominate my senses
I can't believe it!
What have I become?

Something unnamed drains my heart everyday!

Shadows come from light
Pain from the love
Tears from despair
Inside four walls
Mascarate the sin of love
And draining our innocence
The petals go away
The torns stay
I can hear my soul screaming
Draining my heart
Draining my heart
Draining my heart again...

Something unnamed drains my heart everyday...

I can't sleep tonight
These "Me's" are waiting for the absence of light
They want to go through my cold skin
Break my mind's barries, take this life from me!

My smile was taken by routine
With beautiful memories
I can't believe it
What's going on with me?

Something unnamed takes aways "part of me everyday"!

Shadows come from light
Pain from the love
Tears from despair
Inside four walls
Mascarate the sin of love
And draining our innocence
The petals go away
The torns stay
I can hear my soul screaming
Draining my heart
Draining my heart
Draining my heart again...

Much feelings, but no sense
Bird of a prey, without high flights
The empty fills me up
The dawn is in mourning
It's just life dying...
...that's how I feel

Shadows come from light
Pain from the love
Tears from despair
Inside four walls
Mascarate the sin of love
And draining our innocence
The petals go away
The torns stay
I can hear my soul screaming
Draining my heart
Draining my heart
Draining my heart again...
