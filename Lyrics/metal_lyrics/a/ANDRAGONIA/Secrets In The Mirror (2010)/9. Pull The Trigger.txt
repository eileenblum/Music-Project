There's one bullet in his gun
And no matter what happened
It must follow it's deadly fate

I don't know who trust
I don't know who I am
I don't know if I got any friends at all

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
Time to face it's destiny
Eternay tragedy

One thousand sentences running through my head
Million targets to aim
Maybe my own head

My existence seems so empty and foolish
There's no meaning in this life and now I understand

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
Time to face it's destiny
Eternal tragedy

This bullet must now follow it's destiny
Can you release me from eternal tragedy
My hands are shaking my head is confused
There's no time left
Pull the goddam trigger now

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
Time to face it's destiny
Eternal tragedy

This bullet must now follow it's destiny
Can you release me from eternal tragedy
My hands are shaking my head is confused
There's no time left
Pull the goddam trigger now

Time has come to decide
No matter what I do
I have always been lonely
Living this fake life
So full of emptness and lies
There's no painless wayout
Breakout from this hell!
