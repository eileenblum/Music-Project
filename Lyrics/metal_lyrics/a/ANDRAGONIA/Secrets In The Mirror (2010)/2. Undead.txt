Breath the smoke feeling the hate
Standing on fire burning my soul
Lock the chains bind my spirit
Breath the smoke feeling the hate

I can't carry on any longer
Living among the walking undead and their rotten souls

Look in the eyes there is no soul
Just a collective hiterical mind
That rules us all

Look around, look around,
Look around and what you see?

Living undead everyday
(Try to speak with zombies)
This is such a waste of time
All I need is to break free now
Living undead everyday
(Living undead everyday)
Among concret souls and I feel the cold
It's driving me insane!!!

Breath the smoke feeling the hate
Standing on fire burning my soul
Lock the chains and bind my spirit
Breath the smoke feeling the hate

I need to be released now!!!

Living undead everyday
(Living undead everyday)
This is such a waste of time
All I need is to break free now!!
Living undead everyday
(Living undead everyday)
Among concret souls and I feel the cold
It's driving me insane!!!

Everybody has no soul
I can see no brighter eyes
They have just faded away
Faded away, faded away...

Look at the gray sky who stands above us
All it's heavy weight reflects in my voice
Humanity covered in concret marches on
With incoherence reaches a new day

Light of a new day seems to never to come
Our lives seem to be in loop undone
When will come a day for us to wake up
It's too late now there's no turning back!!!
