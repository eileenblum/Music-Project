You're leaving this simple life in which you lived a step behind yourself
Besides the living shadows a destiny you cannot escape

A strange voice surrounds you
Scenes of horror inside your head
Madness wals beside you
Through roads of despair

Tonight you'll see
Through me you'll come to live
No pain, no fear
Scars won't appear after a dream
Closed your eyes on the mirror
Secrets under lock and key

Besides the obvious!
Besides the living shadows!
Kill the locked face off in your mind!
Because it conspires against your extinction!

"Everyday we walk through the same streets
We live like ghost, meeting disposable faces
In this dull metropolis
We meet a bed of roses in an oceans of lies
And that's that we call... living"

Pain and sorrow are too much
I live in anguish and times going by
You took my paradise
I'm without a soul, without you, blurred in sin
The flame that warmed us, now is burning
Cause I can't feel it!
I can't escape from myself
No scared wounds take me inside
All the time I cry
All the time I bleed
All the time they lie
All the time I die
You gotta believe me
'Cause all the things I say come from inside...
...from my heart, my mind and my soul

"And everytime I felt your pain, and I know how much it hurts
It's been hurting your soul, so as mine secrets in the mirror, the lock and the
keys are inside you"

"Wait! Leave me alone! I'm going mad!
I hate you!
I'm tired of hearing this voice!"

"I feel your pain, your love and your anger!!
Do you trust me?"

"I'll trust you!"

"Come on!"

Everything that hurts you
(Everything that hurts you)
Everything is out control
(Everything is out control)
Those things won't leave your mind
(Those things won't leave your mind)
They took away your bright eyes
Some other face controls you inside

Tonight you'll see
Through me you'll come to live
No pain, no fear
Scars won't appear after a dream
Closed your eyes on the mirror
Secrets under lock and key
