Can you hear my silent screams?
Can't you see I'm screaming out your name?

From here where I stand
It's all so clear to me
Now I can see myself drowning into tears
Echoes screaming inside my head
There's no one to take and to hold my hand

There where I stood I thought I could never fail
All my desires drove me insane
I was not prepared to lose that fight against myself

I see through you beyond your eyes
I'm flying with my broken wings
I'm looking for the one I am
There's still time to open up my eyes and realize

Mirror I'm calling you, show me my cold face
Look in my eyes, show me the reasons
Tell my why!

And now I wanna know where my life could go
Heaven or hell,
Evil or angel,
I don't know...

I see through you beyond your eyes
I'm flying with my broken wings
I'm looking fot the one I am
There's still time to open up my eyes and realize
I see through you beyond your eyes
I'm flying with my broken wings
I'm looking for the one I am
There's still time to open up my eyes and realize:
"There's life inside!"
