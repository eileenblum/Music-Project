"I woke up early in this morning
Lost and confused whitin' this mess I've made"

I'm here trying to find reasons who made me fall
And why I had to crawl
I've never tought I could get this far
I've never saw you crying eyes
Now I'm drowning in you lake of tears

I want you to know who I am
A simple man who made his own mistakes

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made

That's how I feel

I've tried to do all the thing on my own
I tought I was strong enough for
But my way was divided in two
I didn't know which path to go to
Who's never made mistakes tell me
Where's the man that I used to be
Who's this one who lives inside of me?
How long will the rain fall over my head?

For all those thing's I've made
I will have to take this pain with me

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made

Here I am, alone in my harvest of sorrows
The breeze on my face will break the ice around my heart
So here I stand, behind my eyes my soul starts to cry
I know it's all for choice I've never made
