I can see inside your eyes
All the things that you keep inside
You can tell me all your lies
And all the ones that you've left behind
You cannot see me, but I'm real
I've been here to see what you do
And when you walk by on that wrong road
It's time to make your heart burn

And now I'm here, I cannot sleep
I'm tired of this voice echoes inside my mind
I'm trying to break free, and I'm still here
I'm lost in my silent screams

Everytime, when I close my eyes I feel the cold inside
For everything said and done I must pay the price
Hear me screaming in my bed I'm waiting for it's end
There's a voice in my head that doesn't let me rest...

"Every single time that you close your eyes you feel
I know everything that you said and done and all you did wrong
Just close your eyes
Just close your eyes"

Finally we meet again
I can see repent before my eyes
No need to tell me reasons why because I was at your side
I'll put fear in your head and let me freeze you spine
Let me now introduce myself I'm all your silent screams!!

Everytime, when I close my eyes I feel the cold inside
For everything said and done I must pay the price
Hear me screaming in my bed I'm waiting for it's end
There's a voice in my head that doesn't let me rest...
