If we plant the seed of rascality
How will we harvest the truth?
We shall lop the reality

This generation is doomed and dead
A strangler silence is whispering the anthem

Beyond the knowledge
The act of God
Creation of suffer
Demiurge of thoughts

Beyond the vision
Observing nothing
Just seeking for harm
And addicted to scream

"All alone, we are alone here"

Overran with dark thoughts
Dreaming of carnage, slaying our kind
This is worth nothing
Our brains are rotting
Now we're miserable creatures

Living in dirt
This soul chose tyranny since its birth
Scream!

No one could save us
There were no guidance
Nothing will change us
Curse is the silence

This generation is doomed and dead
Nothing will heal us
Curse is the silence

When we're staring at the mirror of illusion
How can we observe the fact
When we're objects of this vision

This nation is doomed and dead
A strangler silence is whispering the anthem

Beyond the vision
Observing nothing
Just seeking for harm
And addicted to scream

This nation is doomed and dead
The anthem is infected by silence

"All alone
We are alone here"

Overran with dark thoughts
Dreaming of escaping
Selling this flesh

That is worth nothing
That is worth nothing
We're miserable beings
Crawling in filth
We knew this tyranny
Since our birth
Scream!

No one could save us
There were no guidance
Nothing will change us
Curse is the silence

This generation is doomed and dead
Nothing will heal us
Curse is the silence

Before the lies
Before the cries
Before those all things that never been denied
The act of god
The act of god
Creation of suffer, are we act of god?

Agnus dei
A sacrifice to feed the old vultures

No one could save us
There were no guidance
Nothing will change us
Curse is the silence

This generation is doomed and dead
Nothing will heal us
Curse is the silence

"Salvage your selves
Salvage your selves"
