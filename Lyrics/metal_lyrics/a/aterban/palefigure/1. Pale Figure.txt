Finally find myself on this barren land of confusion.
A desire for shine is growing within.
But fear of the crows prevents me from regeneration.
A freezing embrace is circling around the flames.

Before the last fall wings were spread out
The cold wind turns them to stone.
A freezing descension.

Sing along the wolves choir.
Be the morning star.
Spell the charm of serpents.
Resume your flare!

On this abandoned land. This crystal desert.
My wings got frostbite, I'm drowning inside.

But in this bleak night you'll be found.
But in this bleak night you'll be found.

By fire! My last chance to soar further!
Now I lead my own rules.
I'll dance with wolves howl.
I'll sing the snakes rhyme
I am the law of my own
I'll lit my path.

Before the last fall wings were spread out.
The cold wind turns them to stone.
A freezing descension.

Sing along the wolves choir.
Be the morning star.
Spell the charm of serpents.
Resume your flare!

Sacred palace is your will,
That silent volcano of your heart.

Gain up your own sun.
Enliven your fire tonight.

Descended.
Frozen.
Aspired to flame.

Sacred place is your will,
That silent volcano of your heart.

Lit up the fire of your own
Enliven this pale figure.
