Within your womb, another me would be reborn

Being one with you again and you will carry me within

Suffer from my weight inside
My bones will come from your bones
Your blood will create mine

Your heartbeat synchronised with mine

Sharing skin, a souvenir with its own essence
Far beyond beliefs and the pain that brought us here

A walk through the field of aborted others cradles

Closing my eyes and smelling their presence

Turning stronger and getting to live past that
