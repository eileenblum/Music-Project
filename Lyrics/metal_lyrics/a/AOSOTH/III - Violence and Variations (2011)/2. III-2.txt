Numerous howling bites

Communion through skin and teeth
My rotten bites marking your flesh

Through skin and teeth

The comfort of your screams, so serene while witnessing pain

Let me vibrate via your suffering
Losing senses
Being myself for once
Oh, your dreams, you abort them like foetuses

All which is abandoned is not forgotten
All ends up in me and grows within

From a simple violence arose a round of variations
The decline of you through that fall
Reaching one's abyss, rising elsewhere
