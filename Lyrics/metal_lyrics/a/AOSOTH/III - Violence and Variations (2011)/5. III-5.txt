Finally being one or finally being something
Vision of life will slowly differ, as hours pass
You had years, empty years and now those hands are affecting time and space
Weightless body, gasping for air

Visions and colors will change
Steal them, get attached now
You never did care before and now you know this is your last opportunity

See

That violence, so feared is now making you change
Changes but not gaining any more value
The pressure on your throat, its variation
Violence and variations
