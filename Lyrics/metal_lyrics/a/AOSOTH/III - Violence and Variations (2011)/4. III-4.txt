Only my hands could provide the rest and suffering
Only those hands will be our link
You'll learn to enjoy those caresses and restrictions

Be them on your throat, the violence on your body

You will have to end up loving our only valid link

Those pains so useful, enhancing to a higher state
Embrace them, hold them
Without form yet so strong

Oh no, you won't be holding them as comfort at first

Though they will make you complete
