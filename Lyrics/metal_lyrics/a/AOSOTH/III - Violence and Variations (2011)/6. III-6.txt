Oh no, no one will ever remember you
Nor me, since all this will be unseen, untold, forgotten and neglected
Of no value anymore, if you ever had any

Well, those few final hours

I will not deny you somehow managed to get me
All for you

See it in my eyes, oh I cherished your body under my hands
Paying attention to your dying breath, diving into this final glance

I am so not you, you are all I ever wanted to be
Am not smashing a mirror with you
Those thousand pieces do not reflect me
Would have fucked you until you loved me, until having to hear you say that there is nowhere else for you to go now
That you just belong here now
Until the final variation
