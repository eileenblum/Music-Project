[Music by T.C.]

(In the land of Poddema, old people who cannot adapt themselves to new social rules and values are sent to rehabilitation.
They are locked up in spaces where float some forgetting gazes in order to erase their memories, their habits, their little fads, and afresh they're ready to reintegrate their new world society without fear of preconceptions.
The process of erasing memories of entire lives, and by the way, a little parts of humanity's story can be seen as a drama.
Hear the voices of a thousand memories being erased...)

- Oblivion set their souls : erase to reborn -

"Enter !"

They have become unable to feel their present :
Proof of decadence,
Their spirits' eardrums are blocked,
In need of a total rehabilitation...

Aux chambres d'oubli, injections et autres raffinements,
Ils n'auront plus Ã  batailler contre les monts de silence,
Les rires sibyllins et les spasmes des nouvelles habitudes.
Sous les casques de toile, un vide couleur de voile.

Sous des langes de fer,
Ils flottent dans les gaz d'oubli...
Pour une renaissance... sociale...
Leurs fosses aux souvenirs se vident
Et l'apaisante voix des pompes Ã  souvenirs
rÃ©sonne dans leurs Ã¢mes mortes...

They will know the emptiness.
It's the only reality.

They have become unable to feel their present :
Proof of decadence,
Their spirits' eardrums are blocked,
In need of a total rehabilitation...

Aux chambres d'oubli, injections et autres raffinements,
Ils n'auront plus Ã  batailler contre les monts de silence...
