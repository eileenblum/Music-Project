[Music by M.G.]

(There are five pains registery in Poddema.
Every single illness or intimate pain is classified.
People are subject to these various pain degrees.
It develops their knowledge on the subject of pain and happiness boundaries.
Without this experience, they consider themselves "outside humanity" and being not true human individuals.
Here the narrator tells us his several months rest in the discomforts rooms.)

- Poddema ethics on the subject of Pain and Euphoria -

"Poddema-Ora !"

Oh... I'm locked in the Discomfort Room
Lying, tied by straps and chains;
I stayed for months in these unbereable walls
Fearing to rest in for life...

Five Pains Registers to undergo,
Useful experience to feel humanity's substance

I enter the Â«Plain and Wells RegisterÂ»
Composed of fan-shaped discomforts;
I undergo four hundred and twelve pains
On the eleven hundred and fourty
I taste the fear, submerged in this pool...

Oh, the smells of their terrific bunches...
Poddema home-made bunches of pains
Composed of tortures and natural illnesses flowers !
I feel their flows and let all happiness... fade away...

I shall be human !

Five Pains Account to undergo
Giving birth to Â«sui generisÂ» Euphorias
To become one with their flows;
Ultimate lesson.
