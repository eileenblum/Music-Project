The black pit, the black well.
That is the end of eternity, the birth of Ambloque was the
Celebration of the eternal existence.
When he came, he was kind, merciful, but he changed his mind,
While being in the dark mountain.
Since then his soul has been covered by the spider-web.
He rules only over the evil.

He is coming for advice again and his dark soul foreruns.
He is interested only in one thing - whether my death is drawing near.
What will I tell him?

I will say:
"The dead fairy will give birth to a boy,
Then a long storm will come, the winter will pass and
The spring will approach - and then my task will be finished,
The prophecy will be fulfilled."
