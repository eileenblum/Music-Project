You're looking into my eyes and me, I know. I'm giving in,
You're entering my heart. I know you're burning me.
You're hugging my soul. I'm giving up to your power.

The prophecy is mysterious, and time. Tell me only one word.
I want to hear your voice - my memory hidden in the black well
- the last prophecy of my dark power.

Get lost!
