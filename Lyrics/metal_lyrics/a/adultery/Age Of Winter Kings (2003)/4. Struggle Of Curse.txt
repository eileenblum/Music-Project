You have just come
- you call for a glory - you call for a victory.

The black lightning this dark glare
Stays in your eyes as nightmare.
The dark cloak hides you tonight,
Where desire is in your sight.

Forget it! You are only a dark messenger,
Where is your victory - I want it!

You don't have any.
There's a great winter king!
Look! Winter is coming!
For a long time you will be condemned together
With all your clan till the end of the days.

As the cursed you stay,
There's black seal on doorway.
The distress in your mind
And the death doesn't come.

You will rule over the winter here.
Here, where you had only one task,
Only one.
