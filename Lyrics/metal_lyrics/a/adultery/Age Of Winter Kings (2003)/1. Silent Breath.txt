The view of the eternal sunset behind the Mountains of Sealathia
So eternal that the time was forgotten
It's such a long time since the towns flourished. And it was a fertile country

Tarlendh ruled there - only he had strength to revolt, but it was vain
He gave in either. The Seven towers are abandoned nowadays and the old power is defeated.

But there begins the story, which has no end,
Because Ambloque - the ruler and angel of the darkness is eternal.
Only the old magic can imprison him.
But where can I look for him, where is he?
Which power will release him? Which power preserves him? Nobody has such a strength - only the King.
But he is defeated, he doesn't know, where his strength is, nobody knows.
