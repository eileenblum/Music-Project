[Music: D. Dlimi / Lyrics T. DahlstrÃ¶m]

Hell seeker I walk through fire
To fulfill my morbid desire
I escape this flesh
I escape this world
As I walk the path where no angels laugh
Hell seeker my goal is near
The ultimate fire is here
Flames licking my flesh
Baptized again
A nice warm caress
I came to stay
I have a morbid desire to burn
Burn in hell
Morbid desire to burn
I feed the flames
Morbid desire to burn
Burn in hell
Morbid desire to burn
Burn me
Hell seeker I contribute
My life to all beauty below
My knowledge you take
Your knowledge you give
Together we are
Six six six
Hell seeker tonight I burn
The ultimate fire embraces me
Flames licking my flesh
Baptized again
A nice warm caress
I came to stay
I have a morbid desire to burn
Burn in hell
Morbid desire to burn
I feed the flames
Morbid desire to burn
Burn in hell
Morbid desire to burn
Burn me
