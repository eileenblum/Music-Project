[Music: Z. Nilsson / Lyrics T. DahlstrÃ¶m]

I seek revenge upon the false
I want you dead stabbing killing you flatline
I know your names
You spread your lies to make yourself the bigger one
You think that lies will get rid of me
Face to face you are always acting as a friend
But I know you are false now it's stabbing time
Massacre
There will be blood everywhere
I will enjoy your death.
Screams and blood
To see your life end with pain
Bleeding the false
This is a dream that comes true
Twisting my knife inside you
I am the last you will see
Now its time to bleed for me
Another one is dead but there are more to kill
You are next your blood I spill
You know I am coming for you now so be prepared
I will not stop until your kind is dead
Massacre
There will be blood everywhere
I will enjoy your death.
Screams and blood
To see your life end with pain
Bleeding the false
This is a dream that comes true
Twisting my knife inside you
I am the last you will see
Now its time to bleed for me
I follow you around
I study your moves
I look for weakness
Death I bring you
When time is right
I will make my move
Twisting the knife
I will love killing you
I stab you
Over and over again
I stab you... stab you
Over and over again
Kill kill kill kill
Kill kill kill kill
