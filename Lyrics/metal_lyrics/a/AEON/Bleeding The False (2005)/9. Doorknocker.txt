[Music: J. Hjelm / Lyrics: T. DahlstrÃ¶m]

Where do you hide now doorknocker
Was my door the end of your Jehovah Crusade?
I wish you would comeback to die again
I miss the feeling of my fist bashing your face
Why don't you comeback to insult me again
So I can crucify you as I did last time
Oh please doorknocker knock on my door
So I can split your bible in two as before
Doorknocker why do you hide from me?
I miss to give you pain, visit me
You promised me suffering from god's hand
Where are the sufferings? hiding as you Jehovah
I told you hell would conquer
It looks like I am right and you are wrong again
Doorknocker why do you hide from me?
I miss to give you pain, visit me
Open my house door
Enter my house whore
Behind enemy lines
Your words they will not help
Come back to me
Try to turn me
Speak your words
Come back to me
So I can hurt you
And hurt you yes I will
Open my house door
Enter my house whore
Behind enemy lines
Your words they will not help
I miss your screams for help
I miss your fear for me
I miss to give you pain
I miss the torturing
