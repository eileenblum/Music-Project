[Music: Z. Nilsson, D. Dlimi / Lyrics T. DahlstrÃ¶m]

Kill, how many do I have to kill
To get rid of them
I see them telling lies
In every church they lie
They have no future in my eyes
Kiss this world good bye
I am coming after you
You know your god won't help
Torture I would love to torture them
Hurt them with my hands
Their pain will be my joy
I will do everything I can
To make them disappear
No place for them on earth
No chance to have rebirth
This is what I want
Free from Christ!!
Free from god!!
Free from you!!
Free from all god's children!!
Victory!! to my dark wolrd!!
I watch you die!!
I masturbate upon your graves!!
Hate I will show you hate
Bleed I love to see you bleed
Gone now and forever
Free from Christ!!
Free from god!!
Free from you!!
Free from all god's children!!
Victory!! to my dark wolrd!!
I watch you die!!
I masturbate upon your graves!!
Satanic Victory
Kill
Kill, how many do I have to kill
To get rid of them
I see them telling lies
In every church they lie
They have no future in my eyes
Kiss this world good bye
I am coming after you
You know your god won't help
Free from Christ!!
Free from god!!
Free from you!!
Free from all god's children!!
Victory!! to my dark wolrd!!
I watch you die!!
I masturbate upon your graves!!
