[Music: Z. Nilsson / Lyrics T. DahlstrÃ¶m]

Welcome to the burning of souls
Burn
Betrayed by heaven again
God avobe is just a fake
Nothing he promises he keeps
Lies and Pain is what he gives
You need a god
I am the one you want
I can kill your pain
All you have to do
Is to give me your soul.
Your glorious soul
Your Beautiful Soul.
Trust me I will take care of you
Welcome to the burning of souls
I am the soul burner
Welcome to the burning of souls
I can kill your pain
Welcome to the burning of souls
But there is a price to pay
Welcome to the burning of souls
Dwell in my hell
I welcome you to the family below
Be yourself feast in sins feel free
Forget heaven forget the lies
Erase them all
Your soul is mine my world is yours
The pain is gone
You need a god
I am the one you want
I can kill your pain
All you have to do
Is to give me your soul.
Your glorious soul
Your Beautiful Soul.
Trust me I will take care of you
Welcome to the burning of souls
I am the soul burner
Welcome to the burning of souls
I can kill your pain
Welcome to the burning of souls
But there is a price to pay
Welcome to the burning of souls
Dwell in my hell
When your soul belong to me
There are no regrets and no return
I am your god
There is no way you can escape
I own you
You are mine
I am your hell
I am the soul burner
I will devour your soul...
Welcome to the burning of souls
I am the soul burner
Welcome to the burning of souls
I can kill your pain
Welcome to the burning of souls
But there is a price to pay
Welcome to the burning of souls
Dwell in my hell
