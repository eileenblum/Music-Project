[Music: D. Dlimi / Lyrics: T. DahlstrÃ¶m]

You invoke your god
You kneel before the crucifix
Praying loud
A thousand prays that don't exist
It makes me sick
When you caress that cross
Wearing it around your neck
My fingers itch
Want to break your fucking neck
I would love to kill you
Taste the fist of hell
Awaits you does Misery
Dead fucking the dead in the house of god
Born a Christian you were already dead from the start
Like a parasite you feed from others
Suffering I will deliver to you
Stand in my way and I will give you some pain
Like you never have felt it before
I hate your existence
I hate your existence
I hate your existence
I hate your existence
