[Music: Z. Nilsson / Lyrics T. DahlstrÃ¶m]

You say that he will come once again
And his mission is to rule the world
Wake up from your dreams
Face reality read my lips
Second coming never Crhist denied
Forever Jesus dead
You think that he will come once again
So you can walk the clouds
Let me kill your dreams
As we speak this will never be
This I've heard before
New dates, new years, new lies
This I've said before
Your lord will never rise
Forever nailed!!
Still you live your dreams high on hopes
For the second coming of your Christ
Your world avobe the clouds
Are erased and destroyed
Second coming never Christ denied
Forever Jesus dead
Crying on your knees when you see
No coming of your Jesus Christ
Holy bible bleed and I see
The world is dead in your eyes
This I've heard before
New dates, new years, new lies
This I've said before
Your lord will never rise
Forever nailed!!
Jesus will not come
No!!
Jesus will not come
Second coming never
He won't rise
Christ will never walk again
Dead on his cross
No rise for Christ
You say that he will come once again
And his mission is to rule the world
Wake up from your dreams
Face reality read my lips
This I've heard before
New dates, new years, new lies
This I've said before
Your lord will never rise
Forever Nailed
Jesus will not come
No!!
Jesus will not come
Second coming never
