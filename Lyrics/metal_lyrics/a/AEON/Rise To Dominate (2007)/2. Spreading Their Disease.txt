There are only seven millions of them
But already they are irritating this world
They need to be stopped before they grow strong
A world without knockers and one problem is gone
Door to door they walk and walk
Spreading their disease
They use their mouths as a weapon they shoot us with lies
They wont take no for an answer convert us they must
They will never leave if we invite them in
We must stand up for ourselves when the will say
We are the future no world without us
Live by our books and live among us
Reject what they preach their word is a hoax
The earth will never be the paradise they seek
Thousand years won't come and they will never live on
I know what I am supposed to do
I don't need them to guide me through
I have my own god
So fuck you Jehovah go away
Door to door they walk and walk
Spreading their disease
They look down on me because I disagree
I hate them for that I am their enemy
Death is what I wish for them
And their cult just a distant memory
They are no future so live as you want
Tell them to shut up or smash their face in
Reject what they preach their word is a hoax
I despise them they make me sick
I want them dead
Die they will die they must die
Die they will die they must die
