Pray the only thing the priest will say
Pray and the world will be a better place
If you got a problem then come to church
In here you can pray them away
Let's sing a song about Jesus Christ
And then you will be saved
Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing
A few hours in the church
And you think that you have been saved
The priest just thinks of you as
Work
All your sins won't disappear
Just because he says they are gone
No they will always be
Forever
Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing
Pray the only thing the priest will say
Pray and the world will be a better place
If you got a problem then come to church
In here you can pray them away
Let's sing a song about Jesus Christ
And then you will be saved
Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing
