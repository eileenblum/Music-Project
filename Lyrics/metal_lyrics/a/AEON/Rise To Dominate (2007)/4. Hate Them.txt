They think they are the superior ones
They think they are above our heads
They read the bible and they kiss the cross
They do a lot of things that makes no sense
They read the bible just to hide from truth
They read the bible so they can sleep at night
They read the bible and dream of paradise
They read the bible and worship Jesus Christ
Stay away from all the Christian shit
Holy men prowls in every corner
Don't be fooled by their disgusting tricks
If they try send them to the coroner
I teach my brothers not to fall in traps
I teach my brothers not to believe their words
I teach my brothers to despise them all
I teach my brothers to hate them all
Title: You Pray To Nothing
Pray the only thing the priest will say
Pray and the world will be a better place
If you got a problem then come to church
In here you can pray them away
Let's sing a song about Jesus Christ
And then you will be saved
Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing
A few hours in the church
And you think that you have been saved
The priest just thinks of you as
Work
All your sins won't disappear
Just because he says they are gone
No they will always be
Forever
Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing
Pray the only thing the priest will say
Pray and the world will be a better place
If you got a problem then come to church
In here you can pray them away
Let's sing a song about Jesus Christ
And then you will be saved
Pray for your sins
Pray with the priest
Pray to the cross
You pray to nothing
Worldwide they preach to ambush the weak
Holy legions lie in wait
Hate them
Crush them all with Jesus they bleed
A paradise it would be
Hate them
The strong ones stand tall
The weak ones will fall
They think they are the superior ones
They think they are above our heads
They read the bible and they kiss the cross
They do a lot of things that makes no sense
They read the bible just to hide from truth
They read the bible so they can sleep at night
They read the bible and dream of paradise
They read the bible and worship Jesus Christ
Hate them
