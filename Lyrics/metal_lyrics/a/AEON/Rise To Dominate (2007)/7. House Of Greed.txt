So big and beautiful
But through my eyes a pile of filth
Why should I
Pay for nothing I use
I did not ask for it to be built
Never will I put money in the
Collector's plate
As I see it we don't need this
House of greed
I refuse to pay for nothing I use
But still it steals from what I earn
It steals from you maybe you don't know it yet
Like a thief it takes to survive
Never will I put money in the
Collector's plate
As I see it we don't need this
House of greed
With time more people with know
With fire they will defend themselves
Burn the church down
Burn it down
Fire devours the church like nothing
Stay away from me or fire I will bring
Feel free to hate me but this is what I think
Nothing that you say will ever change me
Burn the church down
Burn it down
So big and beautiful
But through my eyes a pile of filth
Why should I
Pay for nothing I use
I did not ask for it to be built
Never will I put money in the
Collector's plate
As I see it we don't need this
House of greed
Caressed by the holy man
Children hear the bell sound
Gather inside the bible house
Blessed by, Fucked by
C... T... R...
1879 the holy man invites you in
He welcomes children from everywhere
To his pleasure place
The doors are close and now its time to learn the bible
But first thing first he got one rule
What happens here must never leave this room
It's not for the world outside to know
He gives you looks but you are way too young to know
All the naughty in his mind
Blessed by the holy man
Caressed by the holy man
