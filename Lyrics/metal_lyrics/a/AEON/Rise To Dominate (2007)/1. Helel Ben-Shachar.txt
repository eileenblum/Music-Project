Lucifer angel of light
Born in desert wind fire a fire without smoke
Lucifer angel demon
Blackest of the black sent out to attack
He kneels to no man he kneels to no god
Helel Ben-Shachar
Lucifer he said no to god
Strongest of the strong with a mind of his own
Lucifer fallen angel
Cast out of they skies a threat in god's eyes
Defy he defied the word of god
To no fucking Adam shall he kneel
Lucifer angel demon
I hail you Helel Ben-Shachar
The son of morning I hail
The angel the rebelled against god
He kneels to no man he kneels to no god
Helel Ben-Shachar
Lucifer angel of light
Born in desert wind fire a fire without smoke
Lucifer angel demon
Blackest of the black sent out to attack
Defy he defied the word of god
To no fucking Adam shall he kneel
Lucifer angel demon
I hail you
