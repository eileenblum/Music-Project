You speak of Armageddon and hell
Those who follows you, they will all be blessed
But the answers you seek is opaque
How can you still believe in such a lie
Holy bible was written by man
Not by divine or superior hand
Once you see this you might see that you're fooled
It's all about control of mankind
I am godless i salute my desires and i
Take responsibilities for all my actions
Won't need a fake god to hide my fear of the unknown
Don't try to look down on me because i can see through you
Soon you will see
Theres no god you will see you're fooled
Just as the ones you fooled too
There is no such thing as Christ
He was crowned hanged to a cross
And he bleed as he was pierced in
His side on the cross of calvary
You're telling lies and you're fooling the week ones
And you're feeding on their loss and their death is your profit
As they're starving to death
You are preaching, spreading lies how to live
You will suffer no god shall save you
I will show you no mercy for this
If you'll pray then you will see who is right
Jehovah is nothing but hoax
I am godless i salute my desires and i
Take responsibilities for all my actions
Won't need a fake god to hide my fear of the unknown
Don't try to look down on me because i can see through you
