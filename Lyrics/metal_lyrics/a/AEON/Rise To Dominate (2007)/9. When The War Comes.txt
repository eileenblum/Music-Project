You say that I am nothing
With force you say that you will crush me
I await our battle
When that day comes I will be looking
For you to kill
When the war comes crowned king I will be
When the war comes I will slaughter the enemy
When the war comes on the field you can't hide
When the war comes you will die
You will bleed as I dominate
I will drain you from all your blood
If your words were just to scare me
Then you are wrong they made me smell blood
I will rip you apart
When the war comes crowned king I will be
When the war comes I will slaughter the enemy
When the war comes on the field you can't hide
When the war comes you will die
Eye to eye we stand a close combat we will have
You cannot win your defence I walk right through
My attack did hurt you bad fighting for a final gasp
Dead on the ground and I am marching on
You say that I am nothing
With force you say that you will crush me
I await our battle
When that day comes I will be looking
For you to kill
When the war comes crowned king I will be
When the war comes I will slaughter the enemy
When the war comes on the field you can't hide
When the war comes you will die
