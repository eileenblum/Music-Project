You are the past half empty you stand soon all alone
The old ones dies kids are not forced to go
Empty church teardown the walls
Satan rise to dominate
The time is now
Dominate
Lambs of God
Terminate
For you it's not the way it used to be
The lack of respect grows as you can see
You will always feed your searching kind
But your parish has gone from big to small
You took them early you forced them to believe
No other choice you gave them
But now it's different don't kneed your Jesus
And Satan knows it
You are the past half empty you stand soon all alone
The old ones dies kids are not forced to go
Empty church teardown the walls
Satan rise to dominate
The time is now
Dominate
Lambs of God
Terminate
For you it's not the way it used to be
The lack of respect grows as you can see
You will always feed your searching kind
But your parish has gone from big to small
Die the holy church will die empty and no one to fool
Die you fucking holy priest soon no church to hide behind
Die you fucking cross kissers kiss that cross goodbye
Die you fucking Christ lovers dead and will not rise
Rise we all know that he will rise to dominate
Rise to dominate lead control rule
Dominate rise to dominate Satan god of gods
