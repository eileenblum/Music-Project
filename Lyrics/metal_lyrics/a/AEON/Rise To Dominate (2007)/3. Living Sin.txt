Don't push that cross in my face and say saved
I don't seek forgiveness don't step in my way
I spit at the holy I revel in sin
I laugh at his children I repent nothing
No one can stop me to live as I want
Me breathing is a sin in your book
I need the pleasure the pleasure in sin
I can't deny that I revel in sin
Deep inside
They envy me
They know they are
Slave's to God
Deep inside they envy me
But to God they are sworn
For that reason they must stop me
I bow for none
I repent nothing I live in sin I don't care what people think
I live my life they way I want I am a living sin
Don't push that cross in my face and say saved
I don't seek forgiveness don't step in my way
I spit at the holy I revel in sin
I laugh at his children I repent nothing
