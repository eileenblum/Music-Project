Down here we are many you can not see us
But we are here we watch your every move
When we think its time we will bring you down
No one escapes us No one escapes us
The cross on your wall
Won't protect your soul
The bible by your bed
Will burn when you are dead
The time has come
To bring you down
Hell awaits
Come walk with us
We will bring you down
Here we are many you can not see us
But we are here we watch your every move
When we think its time we will bring you down
No one escapes us No one escapes us


Thanks to leon_kennedy_evil for sending track #10 lyrics.
