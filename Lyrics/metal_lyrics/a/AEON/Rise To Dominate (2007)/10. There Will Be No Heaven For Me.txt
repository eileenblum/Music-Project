So we meet again
Face to face
And still you try to turn me
To Jehovah ways

You are brave to confront me again
With your ten Jehovah men
Still you bleed hard from our first meeting
Are you here for another beating

There will be no
There will be no heaven for me
And your talk about paradise on earth
Lies

So here you stand again with your men
Screaming at my face
That my life means nothing

This is my final warning
Disrespect and you will bleed
I know you know I will take revenge
You will be hurt and bleed again

I have no respect for your kind
Disturbing my peace with your shit
Try and sell your religion to me
Was one of your biggest mistakes

There will be no
There will be no heaven for me
And your talk about paradise on earth
Lies

I believe in Satan and he believes in me
Together we are as one to him I offering

Anything, everything and I know I will have my revenge on you doorknocker
You will not escape
You will never escape
If you come here again
I will bash your head against the wall
Crush your head

So we meet again
Face to face
And still you try to turn me
To Jehovah ways

You are brave to confront me again
With your ten Jehovah men
Still you bleed hard from our first meeting
Are you here for another beating

I have no respect for your kind
Disturbing my peace with your shit
Try and sell your religion to me
Was one of your biggest mistakes

There will be no
There will be no heaven for me
And your talk about paradise on earth
Lies
