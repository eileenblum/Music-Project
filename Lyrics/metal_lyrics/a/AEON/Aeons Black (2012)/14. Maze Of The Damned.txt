Am I awake
Hunted by a beast
In this darkness
In this torment from hell
Maze of the damned
Left at my doom
Awaited by the beast
Maze of the damned
A heavy door is shut behind
Iâm left alone with this beast
I am meat for the beast
I know exactly what he will do
Itâs just a matter of time âtil he will
Find me and eat my flesh
He knows I am here
I cannot see anything in here
Itâs all black and itâs cold
He knows he will feed
I know I wonât survive

Hunted by the beast
Monstrous and deformed
Hungry for human flesh

Endless corridors
I can hear its breath
Half man half beast

Am I awake
Hunted by a beast
In this darkness
In this torment from hell
Maze of the damned
Left at my doom
Awaited by the beast
Maze of the damned
I know once I am locked inside here
My fate is to be devoured
By this man eating beast
My torch is all that I have in here
Itâs casting shadows so black
They seem so frightening
I sense whatâs beyond
Or is it my own imagery
Thatâs playing tricks on me
I run and I fall
The beast looks at me

Hunted by the beast
Monstrous and deformed
Hungry for human flesh

Endless corridors
I can hear its breath
Half man half beast

Am I awake
Hunted by a beast
In this darkness
In this torment from hell
Maze of the damned
Left at my doom
Awaited by the beast
Maze of the damned
