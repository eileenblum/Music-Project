I canât believe it, still they come for me
Pathetic rituals to set me free
Behind my door a world of hurt
One by one I will take them down

Die
My hands around your neck
By
Thereâs no way to escape
My
I steal your last breath
Hands
Your death my victory

Scream for me bastards
Cry for me knockers
Bleed for me bastards
Die for me knockers

The words that comes from you means nothing to me
A holy father and a holy ghost
Dedicated to god to do his will
Your death will be a lovely victory

Die
My hands around your neck
By
Thereâs no way to escape
My
I steal your last breath
Hands
Your death my victory

They knock and they want to come in
They talk to get under your skin
Donât let them pass you make sure they wonât pass you
They must suffer if they try to get in

Die
My hands around your neck
By
Thereâs no way to escape
My
I steal your last breath
Hands
Your death my victory
