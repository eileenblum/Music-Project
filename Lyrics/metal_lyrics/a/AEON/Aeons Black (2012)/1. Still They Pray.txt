Pray for salvation you know it wonât come
Your lord is dead and you know he is gone
Live in a dream and refuse to wake up
Dead is your lord your savior is gone

No one can rise from that torture
Tortured âtil death was your savior
Target his body with stones that we throw
Beaten with sticks, death to your lord

Dead is your lord, your lord is dead
Dead is your lord you know he canât hear you
But still you continue to pray

Sinners, we shout for crucifixion
Witness his death by crucifixion
Nails through his body our pleasure his pain
Bleed for us sinners, die suffering

Dead is your lord, your lord is dead
Dead is your lord you know he canât hear you
But still you continue to pray

The crucifixion must have been a paradise to see
Especially for the sinners proud sinners like me
Force this crown of thorns on the golden lords head
Let us celebrate cause Jesus is now dead

Hammer the nails through his hands
Hammer the nails through his feet
No one can rise from the dead
Dead is your lord, still you pray

Pray for salvation you know it wonât come
Your lord is dead and you know he is gone
Live in a dream and refuse to wake up
Dead is your lord your savior is gone

Dead is your lord, your lord is dead
Dead is your lord you know he canât hear you
But still you continue to pray
