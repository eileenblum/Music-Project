Time for confession
Come here my child sit by my side and receive what I have for you
Donât disobey
The priest or the nuns do as you are told thatâs how they have raised you

Raped a countless times
By a priest that preach glory to life

Afraid to speak
This is a man they have told you to trust and do what he wants you too
Violated
To young too know his doings are wrong canât separate right from wrong

Hate them all banish gods lambs from this world
Destroy their church burn them all down
Behind closed doors someone is blessed by a priest
Orally
Sodomy
Blessed by a priest
