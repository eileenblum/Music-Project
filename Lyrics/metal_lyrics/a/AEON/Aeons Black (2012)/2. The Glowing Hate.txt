The fire still burns in me
At times it is all I can see
Suffocates by mildest touch
Kills when it must

March fire walk with me, destroy the enemy
The growing hate it glows in me, fire walks with me
Victims either burnt to death or suffocated
It doesnât matter much to me, they are so hated

Still it glows in me
Hatred grows in me

Hate grows stronger and stronger I feel it boils inside
Must unleash my anger upon them, fire comes alive
Bash them pound them strike them down, wonât stop until theyâre gone
Beat the bastards over and over blood must hit the ground

Still it glows in me
Hatred grows in me

The fire still burns in me
At times it is all I can see
Suffocates by mildest touch
Kills when it must

March fire walk with me, destroy the enemy
The growing hate it glows in me, fire walks with me
Victims either burnt to death or suffocated
It doesnât matter much to me, they are so hated

Still it glows in me
Hatred grows in me
Still it glows in me
Hatred grows in me
