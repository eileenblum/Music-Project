I spit at the cross I spit at your god I despise everything that you are
Leave me alone I donât want what you sell
I hate what you are and what you preach nothing but a pile of lies
Speaking in tongues you make me sick

A never ending hate I will attack you with
I despise you fake healer
I wish you death
Heal the sick with powers that you donât possess
Make a living with the lies you proudly spread
I wish you death

Iâm no believer die fake healer

Preacher fake healer false prophet you must die
I would love to see you nailed to a cross
Like your pathetic little god Jesus Christ
Lies you preach to your brain dead congregation
Take them with you and die

A never ending hate I will attack you with
I despise you fake healer
I wish you death
Heal the sick with powers that you donât possess
Make a living with the lies you proudly spread
I wish you death

Iâm no believer die fake healer

I wish you death I wish you I wish you death
I hate you dead I want you I wish you death
I wish you death
