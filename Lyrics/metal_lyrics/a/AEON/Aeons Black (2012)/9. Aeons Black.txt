Where's your savior
Where's your god [x4]

Sin after sin
I sweep across the land
Your fate is in my hands
With me comes darkness

With me comes ice
It surrounds you
Aeons Black

Where's your savior
Where's your god [x4]

Sin after sin
There's no place to hide
My spears will pierce
These walls

I bring you darkness
And icy winds
Death surrounds you
Aeons Black

Untouchable
Invincible
Victorious

Where's your savior
Where's your god [x4]

Sin after sin
Stare at the sun
Turns black
All life on earth collapse

I am darkness
The freezing winds
I am death
Aeons Black
