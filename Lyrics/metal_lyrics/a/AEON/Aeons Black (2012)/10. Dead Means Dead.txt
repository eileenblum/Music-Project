Dead, he is dead, his famous death we have all heard of
But still, some people think, that they can turn to him for guidance
On the third day he came back from the dead thatâs a Christian lie
Donât you know that dead means dead stone cold is your Nazarene
On the cross nailed and dead your savior with his bowed head
Died on his wooden throne Nazarene
On the cross nailed and dead your savior with his bowed head
Still you seek his guidance on the cross nailed and dead
Dead means dead on the cross nailed and dead

Megidde the final place the sacred heart for Christ believers
There you wait, for him to came, to save you from the end of days
Gaze at heaven for all I care no Christ will set you free
Dead deceased lifeless body stone cold is your Nazarene

On the cross nailed and dead your savior with his bowed head
Died on his wooden throne Nazarene
On the cross nailed and dead your savior with his bowed head
Still you seek his guidance on the cross nailed and dead
Dead means dead on the cross nailed and dead, dead, dead

On the cross nailed and dead your savior with his bowed head
Died on his wooden throne Nazarene
On the cross nailed and dead your savior with his bowed head
Still you seek his guidance on the cross nailed and dead
Dead means dead on the cross nailed and dead, nailed
