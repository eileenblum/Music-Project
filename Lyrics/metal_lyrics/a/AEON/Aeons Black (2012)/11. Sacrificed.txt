Fires burned everywhere when I woke up
I choked from the smell of burnt flesh
Nauseatingly sights everywhere
Bodies maimed head crushed
Villagers that I known all my life
Had their heads on poles by these men
Childrenâs screams and womenâs cries
Echoed high before they died

Here I am sacrificed to your god
Fear as I see my friends die in front of me

Being dragged from our homes blindfolded
Unable to see anything
Yet I hear my friends scream
Cry for help scream in pain

Here I am sacrificed to your god
Fear as I see my friends die in front of me
Killed just to please a gods thirst for blood
Here I am sacrificed

The sun is burning and the heat is draining my powers
I feel the smell of death in the air itâs the blood from my friends
I know exactly what will happen to me, now I will die
They force my head down on the altar
As the knife cuts through my flesh I feel my body is shattered
My soul is filled with hate for them now as I die

I slowly lose my consciousness
It feels so weird and unreal
Ear splitting screams from the crowd
An endless crowd that watch us die
But in a few more seconds I will be dead
And I will feel no more pain
My fear is losing and my hate is growing
I hate them all I hate their god

Here I am sacrificed to your god
Fear as I see my friends die in front of me
Killed just to please a gods thirst for blood
Here I am sacrificed

The sun is burning and the heat is draining my powers
I feel the smell of death in the air itâs the blood from my friends
I know exactly what will happen to me, now I will die
They force my head down on the altar

The priest is holding out his hand and in it is my heart
This is the last thing I see now as I die

Sacrificed
Sacrificed gutted out
Sacrificed gutted out
