I am the one you love the one you love to hate I am your path to misery
I destroy your life I erase your dreams to satisfy my personal needs
I will deceive you I will mislead you, to make you weak for me to take
Down without bleeding, burned without fire your soul is now for me to take

Dream crusher, I absorb all your dreams
Painbringer
Dream crusher, the end of your dreams
Painbringer

All your visions dead and my hunger fed nothing more for me to take
I showed you paradise bloodbath in paradise a passage to your suicide
Take the gun in front of you do it as I want you to put the fucking gun into your mouth
Pull the trigger pull the trigger pull the trigger do it now

Pain I am pain
Pain I am
Pain I am pain
Pain I am

You are so worn a walking dead forever thereâs nothing left to destroy
A dying soul one last tear you shed you are nothing left to destroy
