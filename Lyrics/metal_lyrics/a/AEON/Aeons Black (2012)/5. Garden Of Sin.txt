You are the chosen inside you I dwell
Enter your body Iâll guide you through hell
Open for evil your soul is possessed
The mark of my presence I have on your flesh
You are now ready for sin, open your gates invite me in

Forsaken by god in my violence you are
Pounded by evil in the garden of sin
Eat of my forbidden fruit, swallow the juices all is for you

I am your god here in the garden of lust
Temptation is glowing in the garden of flesh
Promises broken in the garden of trust
Unfaithful unclean in my garden of sin

Once you have entered the garden of sin
Explored all its pleasures and secrets within
You cant go back to the life you once knew
The garden of sin is calling for you
Open for sinners to get one last fix
Feeding your hunger with Christ crucifix

I am your god here in the garden of lust
Temptation is flowing in the garden of flesh
Promises broken in the garden of trust
Unfaithful unclean in my garden of sin

You are the chosen inside you I dwell
Enter your body Iâll guide you through hell
Open for evil your soul is possessed
The mark of my presence I have on your flesh
You are now ready for sin, spread your legs and invite me in

I am your God here in the garden of lust
Temptation is flowing in the garden of flesh
Promises broken in the garden of trust
Unfaithful unclean in my garden of sin
