Imagine the time devoid of false legacy
Filled with relief and no lord to kneel before
Fight for the outcome, progeny of enlightened ones
Fight for the greatest wish of the apostate

Metamorphosis of weak man into the ruler
This is our purpose for the next millennium!

Create the strength
You have dreamt about
Since you were born
In pain and blood

We're on the eve of the new forcefed lie
When the old god bows before new saviour
Memorable moment when the mob
Shall start to use the organs that matter

Every faith has its end
Every idol will surely fall
Nevertheless your wild eyes
Still seek a heaven where an earth's ending
