So still you crawl beneath the mark of stupidity
And bow your head before a fool devoid of pride
Are we the first sin or the last curse?

A single man will pay the price for my greed that I admire
A single woman will wait until lust feeds my sins

The time has now come
For the words of unholy truth
O Almighty Night!
How long we'll be waiting for your glory?

Respect is a sign of weakness
A great hammer of sin denudes the strength of our will

Don't wonder about punishment
As your feet leave bloody marks on the ground
Don't bargain reward
As your hands touch heaven in humble prayer

The hammer is great
Hands are full of passion
