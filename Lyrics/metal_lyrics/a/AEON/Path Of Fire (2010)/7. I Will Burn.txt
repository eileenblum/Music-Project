They did not bring me up to pay respect to Jesus Christ
A holy prayer was never said to save me from the night
On my walls you will never see a holy crucifix
I live my life to the fullest I don't follow the Christian Faith

I will burn
In Hell I burn, swallowed by flames
Born to burn fire embrace
I will burn
With no regrets, none at all,
I won't take back the sins I've done
I walk this earth with my own views
Through holy eyes I will burn

Proud to be the man I am and all I have achieved
No holy army will stop me to live the life I live
Unclean one you will burn in Hell you point at me and say
So be it, but here on Earth spit in your fucking face

I will burn
In Hell I burn, swallowed by flames
Born to burn fire embrace
I will burn
With no regrets, none at all,
I won't take back the sins I've done
I walk this earth with my own views
Through holy eyes I will burn

They did not bring me up to pay respect to Jesus Christ
A holy prayer was never said to save me from the night
On my walls you will never see a holy crucifix
I live my life to the fullest I don't follow the Christian Faith

I will burn
In Hell I burn, swallowed by flames
Born to burn fire embrace
I will burn
With no regrets, none at all,
I won't take back the sins I've done
I walk this earth with my own views
Through holy eyes I will burn
