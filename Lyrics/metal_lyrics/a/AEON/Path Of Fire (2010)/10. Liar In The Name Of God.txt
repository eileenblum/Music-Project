Welcome come inside
Take a seat in my church if you want to survive
Welcome come inside
And let me heal you with a touch of glory God

These are the words from what I would call a fake healer
Just with a touch he says that he can cure you from disease
I am amazed that so many buy his lies
A touch from his hands and no longer paralyzed

Fire the prophet screams and all of you fall on your back
Free now you are free the demon no longer attacks

He is a fraud working his hoax the Christians too stupid to see
People of God weakest of men inhales his false prophecy

Glory of God there's no glory to be seen
Not for you nor your fucking families
The only one that benefit from this is Him
His wealth grows thanks to your stupidity

Brainwashed children all under the prophet's spell
You give him power to continue his crusade of lies
You are too fucking stupid to feel sorry for
When reality hits you will die sick and poor

Fire the prophet screams and all of you fall on your back
Free now you are free the demon no longer attacks

He is a fraud working his hoax the Christians too stupid to see
People of God weakest of men inhales his false prophecy

Liar in the name of God
Liar in the name of God
Liar in the name of God
LIAR

Fire the prophet screams and all of you fall on your back
Free now you are free the demon no longer attacks

He is a fraud working his hoax the Christians too stupid to see
People of God weakest of men inhales his false prophecy
