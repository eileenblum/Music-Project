Born to be a God the lord of pain
Slaves shall fear my name the God of war
I only spare lives of the affectionate
Submission to greet me God of war

A call to submit for a new God
I will conquer your world

A call to go to war - obey
Kill at my command - servants
Fear of my divine - power
Hail the king of war - your master

Born to rule the earth the lord of pain
Kings shall bow to me the God of war
Don't forget that you will die
If you try to resist my will

A call to submit for a new God
I will conquer your world

A call to go to war - obey
Kill at my command - servants
Fear of my divine - power
Hail the king of war - your master

Follow to victory
My request is small
Earth and water
Kneel to me

Both beast and men are under my will
I have the undead to conquer your lands

An army of millions
Against your few
Surrender and submit
The only way to live

A call to submit for a new God
I will conquer your world

A call to go to war - obey
Kill at my command - servants
Fear of my divine - power
Hail the king of war - your master
