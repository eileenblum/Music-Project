Come choir boy stay for a while
Let's practice the way of God
To enter the pearly gate
There is no certain way
And I am the key worship me

On your pretty knees
Open your little mouth
Look me in the eyes
Swallow your way to Christ

Do as you are told if you seek heaven
It feels like heaven

This is the way on every Sunday
You must see me again
The lord he works in mysterious ways
Just do as you are told
Then you'll be accepted at the gate

On your pretty knees
Open your little mouth
Look me in the eyes
Swallow your way to Christ

Do as you are told if you seek heaven
It feels like heaven
