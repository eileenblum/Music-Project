I am what you despise
I am a needle in God's eye
No congregation of yours can change who I am
A lecture from one of your priest won't change what I am

I am forbidden to man
I am an abomination to God

I know how it must sting in your eyes
for you to see how I walk over Christ
I laugh at your cross I laugh at the way that you kneel
in front of a man that was nailed to save you from me

Your holy water won't cleanse me from sin
I laugh at your Christ and his crucifixion
Bleeding your cross with each breath that I take
Preacher I know that your stories are fake

I am forbidden to man
I am an abomination to God

I don't care what you say
I don't care what you think
Everything that I do I do it for me
Nothing you can do to stop me

I am forbidden to man
I am an abomination to God

The church means nothing to me
The cross means nothing to me
I refuse to live by your holy laws
Never will I live by your holy laws

Your holy water won't cleanse me from sin
I laugh at your Christ and his crucifixion
Bleeding your cross with each breath that I take
Preacher I know that your stories are fake
