On your knees you plead forgiveness
Denied

You say that you are the link between man
God and the carpenter Christ
Holding the words of your God in your hand
Preaching them all to your kind
Those empty words do not please you anymore
Young skin is what you lust for

Priest you disgust me
On your knees
Plead for forgiveness
Forgiveness denied

You are the worst kind of liar that is
You deceive deceive your people with lies
How can you stand there and preach about life
while crushing a defenceless child
Touching young children and even your own
Priest bastard I want you dead

Priest you disgust me
On your knees
Plead for forgiveness
Forgiveness denied

Execute the bastard priest
Do not listen to his plead
If it all was up to me
The priest bastard he would not live
I would show no mercy

Shove his Jesus up his ass,
fill his lungs with holy water
I invite your victims
so they all can join the fucking slaughter

Forgiveness denied
Kill the bastard

You say that you are the link between man
God and the carpenter Christ
Holding the words of your God in your hand
Preaching them all to your kind
Those empty words do not please you anymore
Young skin is what you lust for

Priest you disgust me
On your knees
Plead for forgiveness
Forgiveness denied

You must be put to death
a horrible painful death die

Maybe your God forgives and your religion too
but I know I want you dead and your religion too
You serve no purpose here
purest bastards I want you dead
