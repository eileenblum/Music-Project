Weak spineless bastard
God among the weak
You are far from who you claim to be

I know your game and I know how to play it too
No reason to fight I am stronger I am faster
I am wiser superior to you
I know your game and I know how to win it too
Now you are mine for the rest of your life
and beyond I will suffer your soul

You played with fire
Hells energy
I am that fire, Hells energy

I know your game and I know how to play it too
No reason to fight I am stronger I am faster
I am wiser superior to you
I know your game and I know how to win it too
Now you are mine for the rest of your life
and beyond I will suffer your soul

Suffer the soul.

Trapped in here for eternity
Your soul belongs to me
Trapped in here for eternity
Always here with me

Suffer the soul, suffer the soul
Suffer the soul, suffer the soul

Weak spineless bastard
God among the weak
You are far from who you claim to be

I know your game and I know how to play it too
No reason to fight I am stronger I am faster
I am wiser superior to you
I know your game and I know how to win it too
Now you are mine for the rest of your life
and beyond I will suffer your soul
