Eyes of envy stares at me they hope I fail
Anything to make me disappear
All the lies, all the tricks deception
You want what you cannot have

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

For many years they have tried to take my throne
But when I dress for war they retreat
All the words, all the talk behind my back
You will shake like a leaf if we meet

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Watch your step don't come near I'm warning you
Cross the frontier and you are dead
This is not empty threats I'm warning you
I stand behind the words I have said

Every step you take towards me is one step closer to your death

Eyes of envy stares at me they hope I fail
Anything to make me disappear
All the lies, all the tricks deception
You want what you cannot have

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

For many years they have tried to take my throne
But when I dress for war they retreat
All the words, all the talk behind my back
You will shake like a leaf if we meet
