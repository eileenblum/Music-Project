[Music: Karl Westerlund, lyrics: Martin Strandell]

Stumbling in darkness
Frozen to the core
Numb from the coldness
Broken, lost, torn

SOON
YOU
WILL
BREATHE
DEAD
AIR!

[Chorus:]
Hiding in the moonlight while praying to the sun
She yields to the fate she knows she canât outrun
Searching, bound forever to roam
Until the lights take her home

[Chorus]

A frail and broken sanity
A long forgotten will
Become one with nothing
As time is standing still

A deep vast desire
Burning from within
A waiting reprisal
Committing the final sin

Rest in final dream
(flee no more)
Sleep forever more
(let it go)
She feels her soul
(drift away)
Slip into the unknown

Corpses turn to dust
(in a ray of stellar light)
Drowning in insanity
(surrounded by endless blight)
Awaken from slumber
(invigorate the soul)
Behold this world in ruins
(as death will make us whole)

Conscious fading, senses collapsing
Reaching out, into infinity!

[Chorus]
