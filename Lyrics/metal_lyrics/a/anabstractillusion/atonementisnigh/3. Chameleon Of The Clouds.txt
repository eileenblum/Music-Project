[Music &amp; Lyrics: Karl Westerlund]

Engineered clouds, Iâm a Chameleon
Shifting shapes, twisting forms
Up in the starlit empyrean
I bathe in my comforting veil

I see it in their eyes
Watching my every move
Frost clouds my judgement as I tore a hole in the sky
My veil protects me from glares, my emotions are hiding

Fly away, I just want to fly away
Escape this world, this cold paranoid world
I want to hide, high up in the sky
High, âcause I am the...

Chameleon of the... (Chameleon of the...)
Chameleon of the... (Chameleon of the...)
CLOUDS!

Life, you gave me my life
My creator instilled fear in me
I am your delusion
WE ARE AN ABSTRACT ILLUSION!
