Time brings my memories of fight
For this is my last try
To restore the kingdom of Christ
And reveal the path of light... Once again

Lord under your cross I bound to you
With my brothers by my side
Our clothes of honor and pride
Swear promises to conquer the holy land... Our home

The cross in our chest and the faith in our heads
We are ready to fight once again
Flag in the wind announcing our coming
The saviors of Jerusalem

The pope forgives all our sins
Into the city we roam
No one will be spared today
By the swords of the Templars

Over the bodies and the blood in the streets
A new beginning has raise
In Salomon's temple weâve found our peace
Became the rulers of the holy land
In the heart of the temple we start to search
Our biggest secret of all
The meaning of life for the Templar's order the Holy Grail

The cradle of the ancient gods brings pain to everyone
Those who fight in their name will lose this endless game

Friday 13th of 1314 DC we started to be judge by heresy
Under torture we confessed our blasphemy
The only way to absolve our sins
We have fought under the God's command 
And we were burned like traitors
The path of pain that we have crossed in this day
Will be remembered for a thousand years

The cradle of the ancient gods brings pain to everyone
Those who fight in their name will lose this endless game
