Lightning strikes in the sky
Massive roar and heavy rain
No one should ever try
To pass my cape without pain
Iâll sink your ships without remorse
Set your lost souls down in flames

Became captain of the sea
I rule the oceans waves
Betrayed Iâll roam eternally
My anger is your grave
Iâll sink your ships without remorse
Set your lost souls down in flames
A natural tormentor
I am a prodigal son
I will take you by force
Adamastor is my name
