Take your place on the white round table
Choose wise where you want to sit
Respect what will happen tonight,
Got ready to learn
I want to show you what's beyond this story
Introduce this world to you
Evil creatures are hiding in the dark
Waiting for your weakness to strike

Who, who I will choose to possess, to speak through your body
The words Iâm going to preach from the ancient spirits

Do not break the circle of light
Hold tight your hands
Youâll start to feel shiver down your spine
No turning back if you cross the line
The ghosts of the past are searching salvation
And it's the only way for their redemption
Save them to save your soul
And drive them through the black hole

Who, who I will choose to possess, to speak through your body
The words Iâm going to preach from the ancient spirits

Fight for the light, fight for your life, 
The only way if you want to survive
