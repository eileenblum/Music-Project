Is it real or a fantasy?
All this madness inside my head
Can't let this horror take control of my sleep!

Tell me dreammaker why me?
The wakening in the night, and the cold sweats I feel
Should this be happening but why? 
What have I done wrong?!

Is this a punish or some kind of sin
Oh God forgive me, I can't take no more

Nightmares visions of fear
Invading my soul, with blood and tears

It has now past, too many time
Since this begun, I had no rest
Only the fear and the torment of my dreams
The horror that I have seen
Sometimes in the night during my sleep
It`s the reflection of ghosts dancing while I creep

Is this a punish or some kind of sin
Oh God please forgive me, I can't take no more

Nightmares visions of fear
Invading my soul, with blood and tears

Nightmares visions of fear
Invading my soul, with blood and tears
