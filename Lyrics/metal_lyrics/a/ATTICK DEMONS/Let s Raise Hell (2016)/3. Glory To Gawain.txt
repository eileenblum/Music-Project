Four winds blow in my face
And I raise my hands up to the sky
Someone somewhere is looking down
Iâll keep fighting until I die

On my shield lies Morgana's pentacle,
It gives me the power to win, the strength to carry on.

I hold the hand of destiny
And trust in Nyahma,
I've seen my friends fall in the battle field
But victory is nothing new to me.

On my shield lies Morgana's pentacle,
It gives me the power to win, the strength to carry on.

I hold my breath 
And search for the light
I close my eyes
And let loose a sight
