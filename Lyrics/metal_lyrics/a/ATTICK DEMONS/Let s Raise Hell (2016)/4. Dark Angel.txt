Eyes shining as gold
Hair black as the night
I still feel her breath
Under the moonlight

She moves like an angel
In my twisted dreams
A bitter soul with broken wings

Dark angel shine on me
I'm not a Utopia
Dark angel shine on me
I'm real, I'm Saluquia

You are still dancing sweet in my dreams
The ghost of you reminds me my sins
You are still crawling sweet in my bed
A deadly bite, cold serpent's kiss

Longing for your touch
I cannot stop the tears
The curse must be broken
And release all my fears

The promise I made was to take you away
And I will set your soul free
Embracing the fate
Weâll wait for our destiny
