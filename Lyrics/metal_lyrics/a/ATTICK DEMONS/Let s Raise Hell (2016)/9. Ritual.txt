Say hello to my girlfriend pain
She's so hot, sweet and sensual
Leather, spikes and ruled by chains
Welcome to my ritual

IâÄ¼l teach a dance that shakes your soul
By the rhythm of your breath, soon we'll reach the goal

Let me take you to a new dimension
Inner stages of pure ecstasy
A rollercoaster of new sensations
A place where you wouldn't expect to be

I have found the key to get inside of you
The Garden of Eden, a secret to get you through

The night is falling and the ritual begins
Our souls are one and no rest for our sins
Our shadows dancing until the lightning strikes
The dawn is coming, we surrender to delights

Crack the whip, I feel your body trembling
A high voltage of insane desire
Lusting eyes in submissive talking
Your moan sets my world on fire

I will make you reach the point of no return
Bounded by darkness, your senses will be burnt
