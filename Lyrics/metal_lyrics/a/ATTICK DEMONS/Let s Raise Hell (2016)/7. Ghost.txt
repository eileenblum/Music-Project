What's going on? What's that in my room's door?
A foggy cloud coming from the underground
I look again to see if I was wrong
A bad mistake, that I shouldn't have made

Close your eyes, pray to God 
The evil demon will disappear for sure

The demon flies against me
Passing through my body, trying to caught my pure soul
I yell for help but no one answer my call
Looking back he vanishes on my cracked wall

Close your eyes, pray to God
The evil demon will disappear for sure

It's the face of death, you must see to believe
The legacy of the chosen one
Something weird has happened to me
In that lonely cell that day
