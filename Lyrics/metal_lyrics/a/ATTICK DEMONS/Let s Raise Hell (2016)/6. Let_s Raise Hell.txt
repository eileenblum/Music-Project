Back from the ashes I'm rising again and salute you all
We'll make a stand - Never ever fall on our knees

Out of the dark I will bring the light
And I know what I have in sight
All I want is to retrieve what we lost long ago

Get on your feet and be proud of your flag
Green of hope and with the blood of the dead
Fallen heroes that risen our mighty Lusitania

You, you're the one and you shall he strong
Have the power to carry on
Break the chains that stuck you in this empty ground

Fomos um povo conquistador
O passado foi de Gloria.
Honremos os egrÃ©gios avÃ³s

Let's Raise Hell

Rise up your fist with a sword in your hand
Lead the wolves under your command
Hear the call of Gods - The voice inside of you

Burn all the bridges beyond the strain
Take no prisoners, make them feel the pain
Once a warrior - Forever a King

Fomos um povo conquistador
O passado foi de Gloria.
Honremos os egrÃ©gios avÃ³s

Let's Raise Hell
