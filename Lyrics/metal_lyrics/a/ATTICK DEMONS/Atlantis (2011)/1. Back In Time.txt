Moon was rising again in the sky
And the stars looked bright in that night
I fell asleep and dream
I've been drowned by the portal of time

Flying through the spiral of light
Travelling between space and time
Finally I had landed in a place
For me was no surprise

I'm back in time
In the land of hopes and dreams
-Cradle of humankind
I'm back in time
Guided by the will, in the land of hopes and dreams
-To Atlantis I arrived

I'm not a stranger in this land
I've been here once before
I know every corner of this place
Every road I have to walk
