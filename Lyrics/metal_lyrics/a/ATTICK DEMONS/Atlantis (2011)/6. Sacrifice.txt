Just like a condor in the shore
I'll spread my wings in the sky
My eyes will lead you through the path
Forever stand beside you
The hardest journey in life is about to begin
It will make you a stronger man

From the Pleiades we came to take this land
Beyond the Heracles columns united we shall stand
Chosen by the mighty priests around the sacred fire
To escape alive, and settle nations
The braves will survive to spread our revelations

From the Mayas temples across the northern sea
To the pyramids in Egypt aligned by astronomy
While Alexandria, will keep the scripts
Hidden in the night, someday will bring forth into light

Sacrifice
Our lives to our world
Sacrifice
Our souls to our gods

Just like the condor in the shore
I'll spread my wing across the sky

Sacrifice
Our souls to our gods
Sacrifice
Our lives to our world

Just like a condor in the shore
I'll spread my wings in the sky
