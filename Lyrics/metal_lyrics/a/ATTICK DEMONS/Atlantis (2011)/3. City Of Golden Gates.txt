Sometimes you have to hear the voice inside of you
And let it tell you the better thing to do
Somehow it leads me to sail to the west
To reach myself and start my own quest

No one else has seen a thing like this before
I couldn't believe my eyes when I grappled in the shore
Shinning light as gold, holy Poseidon's home
Immortal keepers, the gods made of stone.

Sacred city of golden gates
Empitness seems unreal
Sacred city of golden gates
Where the time stands still

Rings of crystal waterflowing to the sea
Growing trees of life for those who meant to be
Men and animals has melt to work together
A close relationship that will remain forever

I have crossed many seas in my life, now I know
And I have sailed many tides through the time,
As my doubts starts to grow
Heavy stones are aligned by mystic stars
Not many miles away from home

People are dancing and singing
To praise the wise helping friends
They come from the sky above
In our land they still stand
