Do you see what I see?
The fire's announcing a wicked prophecy
Something we cannot hide
Something we cannot escape to...

...See what the god's doom brings
A new reality
A way to show us their anger
About all our greed

The flame of eternal knowledge
Keeper of the sacred script
Brought us some strange feelings
Something wicked, wicked this way comes

Do you feel what I feel?
I'm sure there will be no tomorrow
A punishment for our land
Nothing but an harvest of...

...Sorrow with no regrets
For the lives of those who'll be taken
But we all shall rise again
Our believes will be not forsaken
