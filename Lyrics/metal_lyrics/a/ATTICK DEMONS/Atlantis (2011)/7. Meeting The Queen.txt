I hear the voice
From deep inside my soul,
It's calling me
To give me a warning sign

It's leading me
To a path I have in sight
Where the sky is near
And the stars shine so bright

Behind the breeze
Appears her shinning eyes,
I recognize them from the past behind

I wanna now
I wanna hear
Why am I here?
I wanna feel
I wanna see
I want to find the truth

Here I stand
Waiting for you again,
I'm calling you
To come and ease my pain

You were far,
But not forgotten in my heart
Where you stand in reign
And the flame still burn so high

Behind the breeze
I've seen your shinning eyes
Living with scars that time won't heal

Where the sky is near
And the stars shine so bright

I wanna know
I wanna hear
Why am I here?
I wanna feel
I wanna see
I want to find the truth
I wanna know
I wanna hear
Why am I here?
I wanna feel
I wanna see
I want to meet the queen
