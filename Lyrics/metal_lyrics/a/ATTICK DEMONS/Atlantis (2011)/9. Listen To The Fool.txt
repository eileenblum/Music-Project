Through the times the ancients saids
That fools are always right
Despised by the wise man
Forgotten in their lives

Only insane minds
Can always believe
Warning without sense
Words made by a fool who couldn't understand

Listen to the fool
Listen what he has today
Listen to the fool
Listen what he has to say
On a pillow he dreams
On a pillow he grows
Listen to the fool
Listen what he has today

The world is ending, the waters will flow
Many of you will never grow
Your anger of life will build your death
Burning in lies will burn your faith

On a pillow he dreams
On a pillow he grows
Listen what he has today
On a pillow he dreams
On a pillow he grows
Listen what he has to say
