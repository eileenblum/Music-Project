Behold the end of the world,
The thunder's blazing in the sky
And we are ready to go
And all of us are anxious
To escape from this demise

Falling rain it's heaven's tears
And this we won't deny
Shall we pray to the gods above
To hear our silent cry

I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride the storm,
I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride the storm to survive.

Cold wind blows and waves are higher
Reaching out the shore
Devastating this land
As we've never seen before.

When I look back I see our island
Sink with our beliefs
The day without tomorrow
It's carved in our memories.
