In this cold gravestone
Lies the body of the brave
He once fought
For the splendor of our land

He raised his hands to the wind
For all to know his pride
Glorious past, Eternal remembrance

The warlord is calling to challenge my faith
My body and soul will prevail on the night

In memoriam
Of those who were left behind
Fighting for freedom, giving their blood
Unknown warrior - we hail to your soul

In this empty battlefield
lies the memories of the braves
our hearts pounding
until our last...

The warlord was praised
we answered his call
invaders will fear us
for a thousand years

In memoriam
Of those who were left behind
Fighting for freedom, giving their blood
Unknown warrior - we hail to your soul
