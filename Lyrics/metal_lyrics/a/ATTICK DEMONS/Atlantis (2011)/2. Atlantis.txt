Twelve thousand years ago
There was a mighty land
Not far away from here

A land of pride and wisdom
And of brave men
Who fears not the times of change

Sailing ships across the sea
Quest for power and glory

How many lives relinquished
To rise an empire?
How many tears were strewed
By the eyes of Zeus?

A land of pride and wisdom
And of brave men
Fear not the times of change

Sailing ships across the sea
Quest for power and glory

Atlantis - The dream world
Atlantis - The truth never told
