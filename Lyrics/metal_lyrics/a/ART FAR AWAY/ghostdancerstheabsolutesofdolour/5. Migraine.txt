My hands are disappearing, but they are still there. 
It comes from nowhere.
Flashing circles of light, a numbing pain to soothe what's left in the brain.

Like a blade pushing it's way through, leaving nothing but laughter in this empty room.
My body gets tired, my mind set ablaze. Like passive waste, drowning it this painful haste. 

A drug to clear the way, I need to sleep to numb the pain. I feel drained, slept in darkness, wake in it all the same.

It comes in waves, please leave migraine.
No lights, move slow, I'll never be whole again.

The pain still lingers, I need to take it slow, it can come back anytime, anywhere. 
It is out of my control. Sit back and let it wash over you.

It comes in waves, please leave migraine.
No lights, move slow, I'll never be whole again.

Oh God just take this pain away.

It comes in waves, please leave migraine.
No lights, move slow, I'll never be whole again.
