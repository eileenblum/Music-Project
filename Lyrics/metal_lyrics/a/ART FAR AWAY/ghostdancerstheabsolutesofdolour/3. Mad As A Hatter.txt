I take you under the covers, removing what ever shame you had left.
There is beauty in the dark, where my mothers defining features don't reflect. 

You look at my body, and you're not disgusted
You can find pretty things in the most obscene. 

I never knew there could be someone like you. Your lips tremble, as my body and words dissemble. 

I touch you in places my hands could ever dream of reaching. For under the covers your body feels like it's breaching.  

I am so sorry for behaving this way, I know that it's a reflection of my mothers and fathers shame. 
I don't want to be defined by my fathers complexion. 
Anger: has raised so many moment, destroyed so many atonements. 

I am so tired of waking up alone in my bed, hugging a pillow, I think I need to swallow some lead

I am so afraid of making a 12-gauge decision, whether or not to give you a marked zero salvation. 
Or to give myself a glockjaw with a pink mist ending.

But you lie there sleeping, and I have to go back to dreaming. 
For no one can touch us there, and all of my inherited features are obsolete. 
It is truly here that I am free...
I try to get you attention, I try make you understand. 
But how come I am the only one, the only one who fights for his sleep? 
And how come that when I am finally dreaming, you're not sleeping?
And how come that when you are dreaming, you are never dreaming of me?

I am so afraid of making a 12-gauge decision, whether or not to give you a marked zero salvation. 
Or to give myself a glockjaw with a pink mist ending.
