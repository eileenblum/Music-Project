You broke me like no oneâs broken me before. Itâs all about timing before I lose control.
Of course, Iâm ashamed of myself, but I can handle it. 
But Iâm too afraid of what comes next, Iâm too afraid of pushing myself to that edge. 
Because when it comes down to it, will I stop myself? I donât know anymore. 
I think I can handle the pain, but love breaks something that then goes missing. 
I donât know if Iâll ever find it again. It feels so close, yet so far away.

Most drugs and alcohol are depressants and I donât want to take the edge off, I need to stay focused. Because when I let loose; the jaw softens, I need to stay angry. 
LSD and Cocaine might be something that helps, but Iâm too afraid.

Iâll never forget how you made me feel and that hurts even more. 
No-way I Could Have this One Love Ever-last. 
It was something that killed me in the past and it still kills me every single day. 
I adore you and Iâll be waiting here for you, the rest of my life.

Iâm so tired of being scared, all the fucking time. 
Every single noise makes me feel less alive, thereâs a hole in my soul where Iâm drowning this once happy boy. 
I can still feel him; he will never be healed. 
But life is funny that way, how it fucks you from behind, every single fucking time.

Iâll never forget how you made me feel and that hurts even more. 
No-way I Could Have this One Love Ever-last. 
It was something that killed me in the past and it still kills me every single day. 
I love you and Iâll be waiting here for you, the rest of my life.

I attend tea parties laughing and smiling. Everything is always alright; Iâm starting to not care anymore. Mad hatters all around, not caring for anyone. 
Drink up my tea, swallow some more, if you ask me Iâll just lie. 
But Iâm not alright, I will never be fine.

Iâll never forget how you made me feel and that hurts even more. 
No-way I Could Have this One Love Ever-last. 
It was something that killed me in the past and it still kills me every single day. 
I love you and Iâll be waiting here for you, the rest of my life.

But I guess weâll always have Cornflakes and I wish I could make you see Jesus. 
All these songs I wrote, their all about you. Youâre so lovely. 
And Iâll be right here, until you come back. At least I hope I will. 
I donât need anyone; but Iâm so fucking lonely it hurts.
