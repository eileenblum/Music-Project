Dressed in black with top hats and bow ties,
Their appearance can easily deceive 
Doctors, scholars, politicians and priests, 
It escalated quickly how they satisfy their needs 

A marvelous sound among the crowd
as excitement turns into frustration 

Please don't cry my child, we are all here for you tonight. 
There was such a splendid fear in her eyes
She was truly a captive by her own device. 

What you call compassion
I call fear.
My mind is clear, as it was from the very start
I am not the one to complain 
I have everything I need here, all the same

Release your fears, 
They will do you no good
No little girl don't be scared. But please tell; will you spit or swallow?

So tell me, did your father ever touch you in that special place?
Did you have that special uncle you know that he âneverâ did anything to you. 
But to put you in your fucking place, you bitch

Knives and heartbeats
Laughter and fear.
My dear your suffering will be severe. 
We agree that your body will look beautiful dead.
This will be our little secret when you're widely spread.

Release your fears, 
They will do you no good, do you no good
No little girl don't be scared. But please tell; will you spit or swallow?

We are all ears, to your mourns
'Cause tonight we will dine in the finest halls
The slightest touch, a gentle rub, 
Bitch, this is the Gentlemen's Club.
