Help us! They are screaming on the top of their lungs.
Oh Captain, why are these burdens placed upon us?

Whip them! 
Whip them for fucks sake! 
You know there is no other way to make them behave.

I will fucking make you believe!
Go mark them with your living,
And go mark them with your dead.
Tears are dried by fear, and hearts are weaken by despair.
Break their fucking backs and step on their pride.
To put it plain; seek another's profit and work another's gain.

Whip them! Whip them for fucks sake! 
You know there is no other way to make them behave. 
Whip them! Whip them for fucks sake! 
Reinforce the deception that; it is they who are depraved 

Take up The White Mans Burden, for it weighs heavily on their shoulders.
Take up The White Mans Burden, for they have come so far.
Take up The White Mans Burden, it's been far too long.
Take up The White Mans Burden, the end will justify the means. 

You're such a fucking coward. 

Take that shotgun and put it in your mouth,
You know in the end it all goes south.
