Please take this hand before it is to late. 
I could have carried you away. 
Please just fucking devour this skin, 
I can hear your screams for salvation, 
come here. The womb of your 
whore mother is not yours to carry.
For I promise you this, I could have 
carried you away from this war. 
I could have carried you away from 
this house of violence; where your 
father drains the life out of you and 
your mother. Rest your head against my 
shoulder. Rest there, and I will find 
a way out. I will carry you out of 
this house. Where faithless men wear 
a devil's smile, upon these faces 
where dreams have gone lost. 
But dear, you will die in the bloody arms of your father, after 
he slits the throat of your now dead mother. You will die there, 
beaten into pieces, with a broken heart and broken bones. 
I could have carried you away, but I'm so sorry my dear, that won't happen, for I am just an empty man, I am too afraid of the pain. 
For this I'm sorry my dear, for this I have no faith. I will never 
visit you in this house anymore. Your God has forsaken this place, 
a long time ago. Take this fucking hand before it is to late. 
Because I could have carried you away. 
Please take this fucking hand.
