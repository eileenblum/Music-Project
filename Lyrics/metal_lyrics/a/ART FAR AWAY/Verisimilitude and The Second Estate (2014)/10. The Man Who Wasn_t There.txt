Please forgive me for what never was. 
For what never became the truth.
Please forgive me for all the pain.
For all that I have done to fuck this up. 

For I can still see those brown eyes on an innocent child. 
Even though the eyes may appear the same. They are long gone, far away. 

Yesterday upon the stairs, I met a man who wasn't there. 
He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd go away. 

Please forgive me for the choices that I've made. 
I never thought they could affect us this way. 
I can still feel that child inside, trying to break free. 
But there is no way out, you can never leave.

Yesterday upon the stairs, I met a man who wasn't there. 
He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd go away.

It is just like a shadow from a distant past, captured in time where everything was divine. 
I would give everything to give you your life back. 
But 20 years have past, 20 years of pain

Last night I saw upon the stairs, a little man who wasn't there. 
He wasn't there again today. 
Oh how I wish he would have stayed.
