Fresh air slips out of my lungs way too fast, 
The breaths are getting smaller by each time. The drugs are slowing me down.
I really can't think as fast anymore. 
I am afraid all the time and panic is always at my front door. 

You once told me; 
âI know it hurts like fuck, but I hope you well enjoy it.â You took my virginity.
You were my first and you will be my last, 
I can do nothing but thank you for all that you have done. 

No-one can take away what you are. 
There were so many things I feel that I should have said. 

But God has taken that away from me, he's left me for dead. 
I hope that you will read this, and I hope that you will understand. 
I did everything to fight this cancer, but everyone needs to die.
I am so sorry for leaving you all alone, 
please don't be angry with me when I am dead and gone.

I am so afraid of dying. The pain has been going on for far too long. 
I can almost hear them screaming my name from above.

I still Love you
