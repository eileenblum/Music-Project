So just invite me in, 
The depression takes too long. 
I will do you no harm. 
For I have been away for far too long.

Please let me stay, just for a while so that I can get away, from the pain that lives inside. 

So just invite me in, 
If I could count the days, I would give up too soon, 
I would throw it all away, just to be around you. 

In utter chaos I was born, in utter chaos I will soon glow. 
Ever since I was a child, I have been dreaming of how it would be to die.

So just invite me in, 
before the noose breaks my neck.
Hanging above the ground.
I have paid my amends.
