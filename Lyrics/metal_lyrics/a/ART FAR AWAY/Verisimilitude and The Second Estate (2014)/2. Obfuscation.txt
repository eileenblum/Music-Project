Evil walks this house, I can never go home. Please just hold me a little longer, please just hold me until it's over. 
There are these voices that never really let me go, for as long as I am alive I can never go home.
You will never go home...

Please just let me sleep for 2 hours, 
Please just leave me be, for there is no strength left in me.

In this perception of the truth I can never find my way back home to you.
You will never go home...

Please just skin this virgin girl, I can never hear my home, before her.
Never have I ever seen this place, for home is not what I call safe.

For these screams I have no words, for time has given me something that occurs. From time to time when there's no one around. 
I stroke this salvation against my flesh, where time flies and devils keep in. It's my time to go, no more further hex. For salvation lies next, but it's a bloody mess. 

Please just let me sleep for 2 hours,
Please just leave me be, for there is no strength left in me.

In this pursuit of the girl, I can never find my way back home to you.
You will never go home...

Don't you leave me. Don't leave me here. 

Are you dead yet?

Oh these shining stars, from perdition a light has never shined so far.
Leave this place, and never come back. Salvation is just a bloody trap.
Please just give me the little star, then carve it into these bones, for I am forever marked.
I can finally go home...
