[originally in Russian]

My body is - an absurd shield
Whose centre is everywhere
My word is - a whisper in the underground
And a skyscraper of broken word's syllables

Since my name is a crowd
Since my name is a rabble
Since my name is people

My thought is - a bright crossroad
A tangle of dreams
My footstep can be heard all over the world
Not angels but trains sing my anthem

Since my name is a crowd
Since my name is a rabble

Look back
I'm always nearby
You sign a pact with me on a morning paper
Using your everyday blood

My sight keeps running like a stream
And the glass crystal
Which smoulders outside your window
Is the Holy Star and it burns with a day in your
eyes

I am a wold in a dog's heart
A madness of meek animalns
A vermin seed
Am atom of air
An absurd aim
