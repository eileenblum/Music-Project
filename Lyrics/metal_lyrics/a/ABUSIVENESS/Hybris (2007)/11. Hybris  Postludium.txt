A shadow of yearning has awaken in me
For those years that passed into dark
Once surrounded by a thousand faces
Now lone I wander the world of mortals

Some paths overgrown, others I forgot
Fire burnt places precious to me
A stone in my breast was drawn to the ground
When I fought madly - I curse those moments

The darkness calls me, as before I follow
Greeted by eternal bow of the trees
Among the stars that like torches shine
Their firmament will become home of mine

And I shall greet days with song of the wind
That fires the light of my life
The ghosts of past ages will never return
Who I am, who I was they'll never guess
