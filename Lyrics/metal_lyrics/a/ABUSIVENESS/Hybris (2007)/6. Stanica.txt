A blow! running blood
A sound of steel that awakes me
Pain! growing wrath
March amongst cut off heads
A scream! the fight goes on
Flames lick dead corpses
Joy! Your shield cracks
And there remains no hope anymore
Violence! A strangled groan
Honour tainted in eternal shame
Dread! Animal fear
The tribe of cross sentenced to death
Taste of sweet revenge
Rage turns mercy into dust
Murder! At the motion of hand
It spills rivers coloured by blood

Blood for blood - Memory of ever faithful ones
Blood for blood - For ages an immortal call

Let's raise Stanica - ready for war
Of Svarozyc - to the clear sky
Let's raise Stanica - in battle toil Of Svarozyc - fiery circle

Storm running high falls from clouds to the ground
Bends tops of the humble trees
To free the burden of light from the womb of night
It cuts the sky with a blade of thunder

Such we go into battle, with hearts of wrath and courage
The steel shall saturate with enemy's blood
Let the fight be our work, victory - our peace
With no rewards for wasted lives
