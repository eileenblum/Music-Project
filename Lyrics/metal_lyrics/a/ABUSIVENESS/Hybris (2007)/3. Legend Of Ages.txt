At the shore high, among rocky hollows
Somewhere in the very heart of the sea
A famous fortress stands, ready for defence
As bright as the northern lights

From north, south and east,
Protected by a chasm's rocky depth
From west covered by rampart wide
Mighty with wealth and glory: Arkona!

From all sides the enemies swooped
Carrying crosses and avid for bloodshed
At the may dawn at the wall they stood
Thirsty for booty (and) hungry for destruction

Long the besieged fortress defended
Its fame grew (and) resistance didn't weaken
But its gates fell of conflagration
By force of arms the foes broke inside

The cliff echoes the sound of waves
In it, like a banner in battle outspread
(The) Legend of Ages with victory shined
Snatched from the loop of time and thrall
