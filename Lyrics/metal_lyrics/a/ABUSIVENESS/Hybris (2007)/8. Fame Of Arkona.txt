Who remembers now the past greatness
When emptiness blows from everywhere?
Who's to hear about that famous strength
And the magnitude of ancient shrines?

In the echo of Baltic waves
Fame of Arkona still lives

For centuries it stood like a rigid stone
Enshrouded by oppression of the plague
The last bastion and shield of defence
Proud with the name of Svantevit!

Now, when wind sings its song
From beneath the gates of burning wall
(The) legend carries (the) sign of renewal
Of cults and beliefs long time gone

How great is memory in us...
Fame of Arkona still lasts!
