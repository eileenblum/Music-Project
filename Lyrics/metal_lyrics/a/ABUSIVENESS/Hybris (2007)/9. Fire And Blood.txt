O, wild song
Your everlasting power
Tosses like thunder
Penetrates my heart forever
Flowing when from your depths
You echo my voice

Thus, upwards, to the greyness of clouds
I ascend my scream, ruining their calm
And through a soaring trail I raise
My song marked with fire and blood

O, hour of dusk!
In your womb I conceal My thoughts before the dawn
A sleepy anxiety
To meet at daybreak
The silent gaze of death...
