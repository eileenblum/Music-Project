For a thousand years in silence
Our nation has awaited asleep
Hiding the hateful glare
Like storm by calm preceded

For a thousand years in nihil
We've weaved the thread without fate
(Now as) we stand at the gates of future
We break the oppression's chain

Ages in bonds of lies came to an end
Numbered are days of belief in bastard
(Of that) disgrace in our land
(Of that) disgrace in our blood

The Century too long and too dark
(Will be) consumed by the tongue of fire
And burning a war pyre
It'll bring the calling to hearts

To let the dust of oblivion
Forever cover the 'saviour's' tribe
(that) disgrace in our land
(that) disgrace in our blood
