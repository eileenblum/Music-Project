Look at the deadly sign of this face
Marked with crime for a thousand years
This is the voice of pastless legacy
That commands to destroy this land

By deceit it encroached upon this land
Hiding its bloodstained hands
Under the cloak of hypocrisy and cant
Dripping its poison into our wounds

Revenge - on liars, a song of wrath
When blades of truth shed the blood
Revenge - on cross, by fire and death
So take your vengeance for (the) years of plague

My nation fell into an abyss of decay
With its deeds glorified misery and lie
To the heights raising fustiness of filth
Tribe of the bastard, spawns of deceit

Still fixed upon the underworld's illusion
They strangle our voice with vile delusion
In the name of Slavic, our native blood
Expel the pest of Christian lice

But they won't live long, no more
To burst the fetters, the time has come
The venom will vanish from our veins
Our hatred will defeat them
