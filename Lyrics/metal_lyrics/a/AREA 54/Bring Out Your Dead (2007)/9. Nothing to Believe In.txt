Here I am caught in your lies again
All those years thrown away
There's not much left of me to save

Why take all this from me?
I've nothing to believe in (falling down again)
I wish my life away
As I face another endless day

Now when I look
So ugly you seem to me
Everything that we said, all means shit now
It's gone

Why take all this from me?
I've nothing to believe in (falling down again)
I wish my life away
As I face this endless day
