Here a new day opens
A day of chances
I will drink to that and fool myself
Blind to the truth or choosing not to see
That living in the past won't set you free

...And I (lose my chances)
Can't waste no more time
On wasted days (that never will return)
I can't change this anyway (why do I never learn?)

There's no answers in an empty bottle
I know this for sure
Yet today I've failed to change my ways
Watching everything I've tried so hard to keep
Crumble into nothing
It's the only way I know to live

...And I (lose my chances)
Can't waste no more time
On wasted days (that never will return)
I can't change this anyway (why do I never learn?)

Somehow I know I am strong enough for this
I'll keep holding onto what I still believe
There's a way out, I will get through in the end

...And I can't waste no more time
On wasted days (that never will return)
I can't change this anyway (why do I never learn?)
Time (playing, play out)
On wasted days (a million things unsaid)
I can't change (playing, play out)
This anyway (echo inside my head)
