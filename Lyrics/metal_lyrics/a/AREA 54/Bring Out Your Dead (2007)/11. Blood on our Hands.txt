...And this fresh war begins
Don't they see no-one wins
We repeat these mistakes
Yet again

We live in disarray
This could be our last day
On all sides all hope will be lost
Can't you see?

Everything that we've done to this world
We should all be ashamed
What we do to them we do to ourselves
And things can never be the same

All of those lives
More lost in war again
All of those lives
