Right from birth they indoctrinate you
And old religion forced on you
You're told "This is the way to God"
They persist, slowly thoughts will alter
Open up your eyes and see
We are all lambs to the slaughter

And now we face the crimson darkness
We're locked in battle here - release me

Chinese whispers etched in stone
Passed from old to young
Ever more corrupt
Each time they're passed along
Implications grasped like straws
From this sacred book
Consider what you've missed
Take another look

'Cos soon you'll face the crimson darkness
There's nothing, no reward
The curtain just falls
And so we face the crimson darkness
We're locked in battle here - release me

You'll die for Him
But there's no-one there
We'll die for Him

Now you're sucked in, the fight is yours
You are their pawn in holy wars
Beliefs you stand so surely by
We'll see who's right
When it's your turn to die

And so you face the crimson darkness
There's nothing, no reward, just empty silence
And we must meet the crimson darkness
Wrapped in chains of conflict
Release me
