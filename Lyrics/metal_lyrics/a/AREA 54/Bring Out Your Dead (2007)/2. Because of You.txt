I'm lost in something
Can't explain the way I'm feeling
Thoughts of yesterday are gone
The truth is what I'm seeing
And with no closure
This will beat me down in all ways
Why should you care?
The winner takes it all and that ain't me

While you are sleeping fine
I'm in your maze of secrets
Such a bitch you are
You leave me here and hold no regrets
I hope you like the taste of fist
It's on the menu
Gritting my teeth for oh so long
No red is all I see

I'm not as strong as I pretend
The world is black, and it's the end
Because of you, I'm on my own
We had so much, but it's all gone
