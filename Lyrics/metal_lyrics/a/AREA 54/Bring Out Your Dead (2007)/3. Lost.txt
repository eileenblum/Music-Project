Should I feel ashamed
As I sit here in the rain
Of my eyes before
Wondering how this all began

Welcome to my life

Just the other day
I told myself this would go away
Thoughts I mean to hide
Crawl the walls and betray my mind

Welcome to my life

I hate this life
This life hates me

If I said some things to you
That were out of line
Then please forgive me
I am rotten to the core
And I'm sorry that you ever met me

I blame myself
You're all I have
I blame myself

I hate this life
This life hates me

If living is breathing
Am I doing OK?
Words can't save me
...Not this time
