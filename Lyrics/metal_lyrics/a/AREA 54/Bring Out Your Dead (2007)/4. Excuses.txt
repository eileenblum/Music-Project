Come around, talk to me
The are things that we need to discuss
I can see your way out
But you never try to help yourself

So are you better off now?
And as you fight the feelings
You must be strong and not give in
You could be better off now
You've got to fight this all the way

No more words left to say
I know there are many you can blame
But in the end you will lose
If you choose to just go on the same

And are you better off now?
If you are still here breathing
There is a chance to put things right
So are you better off now?
Just take control of your own life

Just realise that there's a world around you
We all try so hard, and you don't care at all
'Cos it's thrown back in my face
And I'm tired of your excuses
You're not here on your own

Why do I talk to you
When you don't take in a word
And reject everything
The many times I've thrown a line your way

So are you better off now?
And while I'll watch them grieving
You're gonna leave it all to me
And are you better off now?
You are that selfish you don't see

Just realise that there's a world around you
We all try so hard, and you don't care at all
'Cos it's thrown back in my face
And I'm tired of your excuses
You're not here on your own

When you just accept your weakness
How can you expect to beat this?
