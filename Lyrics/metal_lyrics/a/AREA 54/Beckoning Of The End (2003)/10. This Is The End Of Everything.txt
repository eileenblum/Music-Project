Wind blows through the trees
All I see is pain
Open up my life
In the pouring rain
Every stepping stone
Sinks into the ground

Friends call out my name
Everything has gone
To another place
To be here feels so wrong
Every way I turn
Shows me I'm alone

All I ever wanted was to go home
All I ever needed was to go home
All I ever wanted was to go home

And the things that I saw were untrue
The ending is well overdue
And the things that I saw in my head
They tell me I'm better off dead

I cannot be who you want me to be
And now I know that this is not enough for me
I'm growing old, getting weaker every day
Within my heart I know there is no other way
Alone, I stand alone
All else has failed and there's nowhere left to hide

This is the end of everything
I can see what tomorrow brings
This is the end of everything
The end

I cannot be who you want me to be
But I love you more than I show
Please think of me as the child with that smile
And not a fool who lived on in denial

I'm tired of being alone
All else has failed and there's nowhere left to hide
Suicide

This is the end of everything
I can see what tomorrow brings
This is the end of everything
The end

I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting

All I see is pain

Lost myself in the dream
Can I make it somehow?
In this place I call home
I remain with a frown
