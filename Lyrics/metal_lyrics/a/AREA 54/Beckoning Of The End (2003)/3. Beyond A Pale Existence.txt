Beyond a pale existence is heaven?
And you know that you can't take
The fear you have inside
So you read the words of 'Trust' by another
And pray to God you'll wake
In hell you just can't hide

And still the pain surrounds the sadness
Beyond this life we're pushed with time
The fear of the unknown is madness
As we move further down the line

When life is nothing but a struggle
And you disintegrate
And long to meet your death
You wonder if the day will surface
When you can feel the sun
Instead of life's cold breath

Meanwhile existence seems so futile
And one by one we're going down
We're lost and left to rust in silence
Just like an old corroded town

And still the pain surrounds the sadness
Beyond this life we're pushed with time
The fear of the unknown is madness
As we move further down the line
