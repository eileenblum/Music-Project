Like a servant on a new day
Growing tired of the game
Going nowhere
'til I find my
Secret place of my own
And all the people in my hometown
Say that I don't belong
One cold instinct to survive this
From this cruel world I hide

Living a lie
Living this way and on my own
In my head
Feeling the pain of 'once again'
In my soul
Seeing the world for what it is
On my own
And I feel
I'm...

Living a Lie
I can't live through these words
Through these eyes
(Live) In a lie
I can't live through these words
Through this life

Blood on my hands
And scars on my wrists
Would bear the truth that I face
Trying so hard I lost my youth
And my soul
When seeing a whore for what she is
Now I know Am I free or...

Living a Lie
I can't live through these words
Through these eyes
(Live) In a lie
I can't live through these words
Through this

Living a Lie
I can't live through these words
Through these eyes
In a lie
I can't live through these words
Through these
(Eyes) Living a lie
I can't face my last words
Through these eyes
(Live) in a lie
I can't live
