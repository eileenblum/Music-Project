Time heals my eyes
But not what they've seen
And the mirror tells only lies
I walk in darkness
Lost in your fortress
Trying to find some peace of mind

I can't see that there's a way out
You chew on the sanity left in me

In my blood, through my veins
And now you fill my brain
Open truth torn away
I've lost another day
In my blood, through my veins
And now you fill my brain
Hope and truth torn away
I'm drowning in my pain

Now I'm twisted up
And mislead like a story with no end
And they still fear me
Though I can't break free
From the shit you've given me
I don't need your traditions
You just love the power over me

In my blood, through my veins
And now you fill my brain
Open truth torn away
I've lost another day
In my blood, through my veins
And now you fill my brain
Hope and truth torn away
I'm drowning in my pain

I can't see that there's a way out
And you just need to leave me be

In my blood, through my veins
And now you fill my brain
Open truth torn away
I've lost another day
In my blood, through my veins
And now you fill my brain
Hope and truth torn away
I'm drowning in my pain

Waiting for the time to come
When I will need no-one
Dead and boxed this pain long gone
This cannot be undone
I lived my life day by day
Watching myself decay
And prayed the world would go away
I'm drowning in my pain
