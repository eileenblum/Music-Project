As time goes by
And your words die
The pain that remains
Is all I can save, is all I own

Before too long I will know
Another life just gone
Letting go, so hard to say
And I wish that you could stay

As I return, my heart must yearn
For time, ease my mind, move on
Realise I can't stop time

And your tears they show
All the things I already know
As I watch you drift away
And the light begins to fade

I tried to show
Who I am, I just don't know
And I wish you could have stayed
As the light began to fade
