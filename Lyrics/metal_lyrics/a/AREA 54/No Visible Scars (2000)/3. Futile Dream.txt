The same old theme
Hold a futile dream
Marching in my head
When the truth is what I dread
Look through my eyes
As you fill me up with lies
Like a hurricane
You just throw me away

I catch the nigh train in my head (in my head)
They're out to get me want me dead (they want me dead)
And I'm still right next door to hell (I just can't tell)
These 14 years cast the spell (and wrote my hell)

I can't pretend
For I know this is the end
This war in my head
This hurtful life that I wish I left
A long time ago
And put to sleep this infinite dream
When enemy means the same as friend
And there is no trust

I catch the nigh train in my head (in my head)
They're out to get me want me dead (they want me dead)
And I'm still right next door to hell (I just can't tell)
These 14 years cast the spell (and wrote my hell)
