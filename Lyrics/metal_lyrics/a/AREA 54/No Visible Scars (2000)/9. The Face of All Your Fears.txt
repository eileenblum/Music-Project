I'm the one who you don't see
Living just to make you bleed
I'm the one who holds the key
To your chains of misery

I'm the God who'll make you crack
And when you run I'll claw your back
You hide away but I'll just stay
You can't escape your misery

I'm the salt in your, in your wound
I'm the pain, the pain thats in your womb
I suck your blood and watch you bow to me
Only to leave your life in legacy
I'm the pain, the pain thats in your womb
I'm the salt in your, in your wound
I suck your blood and watch you bow to me
Only to leave your life in legacy

Bow to me
Live in misery
Bow to me

I am your fear
