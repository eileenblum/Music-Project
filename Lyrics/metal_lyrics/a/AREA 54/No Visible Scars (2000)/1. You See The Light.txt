Sometimes I feel such frustration
A distant voice is not a game
The feeling in my brain will tear
When anger is there
And all I really want is justice, but...

You see the light, feeling right
You see the light
You see the light, feeling right
You see the light

So now you fear your own creation
And wish for it to go away
Then life could be so back to normal
With other lives you could then play
' Cos I realise that it doesn't mean a damn thing

You see the light, feeling right
You see the light
You see the light, feeling right
You see the light

You see the light, feeling right
You see the light
You see the light, feeling right
You see the light
