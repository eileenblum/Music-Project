Things you just can't see
Are bringing me down
I want to die, you close you eyes
How can I lose that frown
When all you do is cut
Through all that I've worked for
I've tried to live, I can't forgive
Or help you anymore
No

With all that's going on I still try to fight
I feel my pain, you play your games
And now I know what's right
When will you realise
You're making me feel old
I'll take no more, I've closed the door
Feels like I'll have a mental overload
