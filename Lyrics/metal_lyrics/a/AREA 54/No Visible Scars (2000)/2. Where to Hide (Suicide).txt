Where to hide is what I want to know
Where to go is what I need to see
How I lost all this I just don't know
What I hate is buried deep in me

Hide behind a fallen tree
Living in my misery
Time to find the space I need
All I am is the air I breathe
Hide behind a fallen tree
Live inside my misery
What I need is clarity
Where it is I just can't see

I've been saying I could see
The real enemy
Trapped in thoughts that I believed
And now I've been deceived
Trust inside a circle full of hate
Now I feel for me it's just too late

Hide behind a fallen tree
Living in my misery
Time to find the space I need
All I am is the air I breathe
Hide behind a fallen tree
Live inside my misery
What I need is clarity
Where it is I just can't see

Hide behind a fallen tree
Living in my misery
Time to find the space I need
All I am is the air I breathe
Hide behind a fallen tree
Live inside my misery
What I need is clarity
Where it is I just can't see
