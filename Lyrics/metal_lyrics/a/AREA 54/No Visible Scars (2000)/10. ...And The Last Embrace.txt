Do any words I say
Mean a thing to you
I see it in your face
Will it meet with your embrace
Can't you see my hate for you
Grows with everything you do
Fucking bitch
Now I start to see
This is how it's meant to be
It's not, it's not too late for me
To do what's in my head
And cut you off instead

This is how it's gonna be
In my world I will be free
In the past I've let it be
No more of this I decree

So now these thoughts are true
And your lies I see right through
Can you win this game
Ask yourself who lives in pain
Can't you see my hate for you
Beckons me to run you through
I have won your favourite game
Ruin him bitch just the same
With the darkness in your eyes
Wearing thin on your disguise
Fraying fast my love has died
My last words you realise

This is how it's gonna be
In my world I will be free
In the past I've let it be
No more of this I decree

Now with this last poisoned kiss
The queen of sadness knows
Cold darkness comes to me again
One final time alone
And with my tears I know my soul must surely die
In breathless sleep I will not dream
Embrace death one last time
