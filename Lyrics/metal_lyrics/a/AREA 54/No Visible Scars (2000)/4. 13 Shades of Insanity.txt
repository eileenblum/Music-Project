I'm lost and found
In dark fields of me
Light shines around but I can't see
Look in a trance
At the black ghost dance
The reaper I see I know is me

I would search and find
The light that shines me blind
I'm lost for all of time
I would search and find
The horrors in my mind
I'm running out of time

Stagger and frown
Languid in fear
I must confess all is unfound
In this old town
Nothing is clear
Thirteen is all I have around

I would search and find
The light that shines me blind
I'm lost for all of time
I would search and find
The horrors in my mind
I'm running out of time
