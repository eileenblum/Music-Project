Parasitic

Lost until your final breath
I'll never be like you
Climbing through another mind
And taking what you choose
Lost until your final breath
You cannot criticise
Story takes another twist
With venom in your eyes

His life is negative, drown in his dreams
He wants to be me
Conflict runs through his mind
Just to fulfill his parasitic needs

Lost until your final breath
I'll never be like you
Climbing through another mind
And taking what you choose
Lost until your final breath
You cannot criticise
Story takes another twist
With venom in your eyes

His words are irrelevant
Judging the things he claims to understand
Forcing views down on me
Closing my fist I draw back my hand

Lost until your final breath
I'll never be like you
Climbing through another mind
And taking what you choose
Lost until your final breath
You cannot criticise
Story takes another twist With venom in your eyes
