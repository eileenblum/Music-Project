Years pass by fast
Time takes no pain
And I can't face God
And I cannot dream
And I can't go back
To what I believed

In my heart, in my mind
Still I see you all the time
In my words I define
All that's lost, but I'll be fine

Days come, Days go
I'm weak, I know
Still I will hold on
Though I cannot dream
On the other side
The grass is always green

In my heart, in my mind
Still I see you all the time
In my words I define
All that's lost, but I'll be fine
In my mind
Still I see you all the time
In my words I define
All that's lost, but I'll be fine - yeah
