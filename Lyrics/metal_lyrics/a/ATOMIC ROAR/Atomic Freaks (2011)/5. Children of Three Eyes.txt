There's no hope in this town
Just black smog in the sky
Mutant babies born to serve
The third class of underground

They are deformed babies
Just deformed slaves

Six bucks you can buy a child
To work hard all day and night
There's no law in mutant's land
There's no rights in underground

They are deformed babies
Just deformed slaves
