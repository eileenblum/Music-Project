This war makes no sense
We are close to extinction... Mutants or not!
Many were contaminated
That's no difference between us! No more
We are all freaks in this world
This gray world! Ruins of the past!
That rage we were living
Is finished! Now it's time to rest!

It's time to rest
But I can feel
War is our disease

Atomic freaks
Atomic freaks - That's the new age
Atomic freaks
Atomic freaks - Many died, and now we can see the sunrise

Let's bury the bodies
Along with the near and distant past
We will never see a green world
But we can do this gray something better
We are all freaks in this world
This gray world! Ruins of the past!
That rage we were living
Is finished! Now it's time to rest!

It's time to rest
But I can feel
War is our disease

Atomic freaks
Atomic freaks - That's the new age
Atomic freaks
Atomic freaks - Many died, and now we can see the sunrise
