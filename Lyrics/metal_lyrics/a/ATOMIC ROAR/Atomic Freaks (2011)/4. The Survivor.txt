Hard life in sewers
After gas attack
I'll climb to steal tonight
I'll try to get a mask

I don't want to pay the price
I can't change my nasty life
I'm ready to fight this war
I feel fine to carry on

Sewer survivor
I stole a mask
Now I feel allright
Sewer survior
I don't care for gas
I can breathe at night

The cockroaches are feeding
On my facial rash
I lost my sixth finger
For the damned rats
