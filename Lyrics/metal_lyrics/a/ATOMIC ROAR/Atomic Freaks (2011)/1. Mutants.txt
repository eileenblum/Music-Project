Metamorphosis by radiation
Prepare your masks and save your children
The radio informed that bad situation
And now your home is not a good shelter

That's cause for alarm
The bombs are not our problem now
Listen what our people are saying:
Mutants gonna take your brains

Let's start the executions
They are not our friends, they are not our neighbours (anymore)
They run away, but we can find them
Our people said: Rats in the sewers!

That's cause for alarm
The bombs are not our problem now
Listen what our people are saying:
Mutants gonna take your brains

(Mutants)
Now we can't see the sunrise
They'll pay this price
We're living with rats
And revenge will come all night!

That's cause for alarm
The bombs are not our problem now
Listen what our people are saying:
Mutants gonna take your brains

Beware of the mutants
Don't touch the skin of mutants
Who cares about the mutants
Beware of the mutants
