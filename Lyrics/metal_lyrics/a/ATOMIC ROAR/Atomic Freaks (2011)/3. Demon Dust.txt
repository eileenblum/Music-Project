You know one day you saw hopeness and happiness
Green trees and fresh air (land) not this hell
Those days when your lungs didn't hurt while you breathe
Come with me and taste the spel

You will remember the victories of good times
Take this dust! You have to smell
Radioactivity! Our skin turns to dust
One breath and you'll see your best days

Demon dust
Demon dust

I am creating an army and now you're recruited
Soon we'll be on the streets again
You just need to bring me weapons and supplies
We can win this war!

Demon dust
Demon dust
