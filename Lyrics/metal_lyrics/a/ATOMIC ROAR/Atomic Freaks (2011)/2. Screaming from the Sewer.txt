Humiliation!
They locked us in sewers! They lost their minds!
Like I've never seen before
They didn't care if we were women and children

And that riot killed many of us!
Their eyes were burning! They were in trance!

Now our home stinks like shit
Screaming from the sewers
And your future stinks like death
Screaming from the sewers

We had to run
But fear and cowardice are not like the same thing
That's what I want
A chance to avenge our brothers and sisters

And that riot killed many of us!
Their eyes were burning! They were in trance!

Now our home stinks like shit
Screaming from the sewers
And your future stinks like death
Screaming from the sewers

Humiliation!
They locked us in sewers! They lost their minds!
Like I've never seen before
They didn't care if we were women and children

And that riot killed many of us!
Their eyes were burning! They were in trance!

Now our home stinks like shit
Screaming from the sewers
And your future stinks like death
Screaming from the sewers
