I look to the sun and remember the past
A near past, when I used to live
I don't call what I do as "to live"
Not like that, I prefer to die!

I killed a man and state his supply
One shot and he slipped to the floor
I could see when his eyes lost their shine
And that shine will never come back

The memories of the past
Only bring me pain
I'm not dead or alive
Look what I've become

Murderer / Dirty
With no home
Marauder

Butcher / Hungry
Animal
Marauder

Consequence of a stupid war
And this war is not my choice
Men that think they rule the world
And that beasts that fight for the sunrise

The memories of the past
Only bring me pain
I'm not dead or alive
Look what I've become

Murderer / Dirty
With no home
Marauder

Butcher / Hungry
Animal
Marauder
