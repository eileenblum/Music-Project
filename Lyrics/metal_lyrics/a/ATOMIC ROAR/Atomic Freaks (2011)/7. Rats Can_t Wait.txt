Almost midnight and rats
Are walking through the sewers
I can't stand anymore!

I checked my bullets
Before the attack
Demon dust to relax

Rats can't wait
Oh! Please!
Oh! Please!
Rats can't wait

I can't live this way
Smelling demon dust every day
Everything is gray in this morning
I'll turn all red this night

Rats can't wait
Oh! Please!
Oh! Please!
Rats can't wait

Rats can't wait
Rats can't wait
