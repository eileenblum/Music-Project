They think they rule like the world
(They) wanna lock us here
Treat us like animals
Then back to demon dust

That's right
We'll fight
For sunrise
Not this hell

The smell of sewage is strong!
That's part of me now!
They all think we are dirty
But that's not our fault

That's right
We'll fight
For sunrise
Not this hell

That's right
We'll fight
For sunrise
Not this hell

Diseases and parasites
We're trapped here
We must act now
Tomorrow will be too late
