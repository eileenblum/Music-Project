Dark heavens the blissful earth chokes
Conquered by shadows of a thousand crows
Pestilential stench, rotten corpse
Befogs the forest, death-stricken
Forceful will of retaliation
The tender undertone of Satan
Preaching of our fate and of our enemies
Despising the grace of divinity

Sins acute, piercing veins
Bloodshed stains the iron chains
Scales dark pitched, eyes gleaming green
Insignia of our tribe, destiny slain
Ghastly hair prolonged by hate
Weaving sins, vigorous, strained
This bloody pledge that we take
Bleeds wisdom through the eyes of the Snake

In the eyes
The darker side
Daystar fades
Nightstar glides

Argently the starlight shines
Reflecting the shaft of the scythe
Fear follows, blood drains
Annihilation echoes in the valley's gloom
Ramping thunderous, road of revenge
The Dark Ride carries his headpiece lanced
Gradually drawing close
Devouring your peace desiring soul

Dark funerals, sullen air swells
The death-lake swallowed the moonlight, chilled
Thirteen corpses in cerement enslaved
The Sorceress whispers the Snake-god's will
Sky ripping bats from under-earth soar
Warriors roar a cry of war
Bloodthirsty tunes they croak
From the depths of hell they evoke

Dark descendants
This you will revive
Damnation, our destiny
Darkness never the light shall free
Warfare will forever be

Brutal tunes, torments sing
Weeping angels, smoldering wings
Scars innumerous incised
Seizing that tear from a sorrowful eye
Distorted countenance seen
Forking evil, two-pointed tongues
Savoring the sweetness of deathly beings
Devouring innocent dreams
To hell you sanctimonious souls
Preposterous apostles of God
I'll scorn your relentless death
Beings, dirty, despicable
Now is the hour you all shall die
Your wretched moans shall linger
Until the time your blood runs dry
In gasping pain you lie

Nightmares soon shall fade
Soul-betrayed corpse of the Snake
Disbursements for boundless power
Vacuity, misery, torment, anxiety
Angel who walks in the shadow of the shade
In peace all shall retire

This time those eyes disclose de novo
Sharpness of gleaming green
Scattering, slicing, swords of ray
Suckling blood, slaughtering heat
Tempting trap of poisonous fangs
Now left everlastingly senseless
The damned among the living
Till eternity reconciling
