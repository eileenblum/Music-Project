Near the insanity I feel my soul exposed
to the hate that rises in me erases the reason
For which I must rebel against my existence
I scream with fury âsacrifice this mortal lifeâ.
My being starts to spoil, my sight distorts the hope
the lack of blood allows my head to dellate
Without turning back I start my ritual
this perfect fucking crime will be against me.

Drowning in my own being
Questions of what I used to be.
(Questions of what I used to be)
As I am dying in this agony, I think
if this rope could free my suffering.
Violation of my so called rights
cold instance obsessive yearning of a true life
Those remaining seconds of emotions canât heal this doubt
the ruins of a sad life, away has gone.

Drowning in my own being
Questions of what I used to be
No one could brought me down (only me)
Wings of suicide forever free.
