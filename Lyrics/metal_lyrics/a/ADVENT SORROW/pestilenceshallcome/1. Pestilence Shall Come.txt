You fear the cold at last?
Feel the still flaking, crooked arms.
Iâll puke myself dry.

And such flaming light has fallen,
from heavens to earth.
So feel the tremble below.
Forever.

And down below howls, so far below.

A fucking calling; hear the screaming?
With wounds stretching all the world.
Crawling deeper through the hole.

Writhing in fear.
This place, brings us suffering
and Iâve become one last man,
to heal the wounded scars.

We are fools and we are so wrong.
Selfish, cowards. Pulling from all.
I canât breath and wake up, no one stares up.
Calling and weeping for the stars.

Murder, torture. Pestilence so freeing.
Call to me and sacrifice yourself
and flee into the stars.
