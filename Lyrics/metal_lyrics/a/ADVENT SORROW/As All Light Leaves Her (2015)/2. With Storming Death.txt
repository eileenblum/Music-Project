Return, return;
While Storming Death
Return, return,
With worms crawling deeper.

Decomposing earth,
Black shadows
Feigning the torture
Trailing the scent
Of complete darkness
Masturbating with dead animals
These crooked tortures
A losing game of hanging nooses.

Return return,
TO decomposing earth
Return, return;
While Storming Death
Return, return,
With worms crawling deeper.

Your flames can't touch me,
As I gaze upon glory,
Graze my tongue upon tender skin.

Decomposing earth,
Black shadows
Feeding the darkness,
Crooked torture
Screaming for the light.
Masturbating with dead animals
While rats crawl in deeper.

If I list all of these maddening aspects to my life,
It is only a call to escape.
To escape.
A path is collapsing my mind.

Fuck this place,
Let the worms eat.
A losing game of falling nooses.
Death sent her,
No longer held in place,
Death sent her,
These crooked tortures
Death sent her,
Is only a calling to escape
While Storming death.
