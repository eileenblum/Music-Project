My wounds are vast.
My body weakens.
These hours pass so slow.
Cruel punishment
Self destruction my release.
Bitter path,
On my knees before the grace of this suffering.

I still breathe the dust of Earth.
I still see the waste of life.
I still speak in tormented tongues.
I still see it's hollow form.

My wounds are vast.
I wish to leave this place.
All traces of life have left me.
Carry my empty soul.
Shining Hollow.

Carry my empty soul.
Shining Hollow.
Whisper my final breath.
Shining Hollow.

My wounds are vast.
My body weakens.
These hours pass so slow.
Cruel punishment
Self destruction is my release.
Bitter path,
On my knees before shining hollow.

Carry my empty soul.
Shining Hollow.
Whisper my final breath.
Shining Hollow.
