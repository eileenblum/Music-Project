Rubbing salt into open wounds,
Have another drink,
Take in the pain.
I am a coward,
Having lost myself.
And I am nothing to this world.

Ever yearning helpless,
burning cold and dead.
No more breathing.
No more breathing.
Forever curse this moment.
No longer concerned.
As the light fades from her eyes.
As the light fades from her eyes.

And I crawl into shadow.
Where the claws sink in.
And I crawl into shadow.

Rubbing salt into open wounds,
There's nothing beautiful left for me.
No sun shines from the sky above.
Nothing in the distance, just a dead suffocating void.

Where the claws sink in.
And I crawl into shadow.
When the poison takes hold.
And I crawl into shadow.
Where the claws sink in.
And I crawl into shadow.
When the poison takes hold.
And I crawl into shadow.
