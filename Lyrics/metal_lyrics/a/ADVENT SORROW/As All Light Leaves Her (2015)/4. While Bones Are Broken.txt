There's something moving inside of me
There's something breaking me apart.

Tear away and watch it all come bleeding.
Like a rancid wound refusing to heal.
I know there's no other.
I am my only companion through this bleak life.

And breathe now.
Breathe now.

The endlessness starts with you waiting longer,
My desperate wound.
Time is running out.
Become the bone that's breaking.
So breathe.

The structure is breaking.
The structure is breaking.
While bones are broken.

Now, you can't breath.
Now die.
Now.
