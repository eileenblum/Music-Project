I pray, not a single whisper will escape.
A place too cold to breathe.

I have searched for you.
In the corners. Reach out.
I'm not ready to fucking go.
Carry me now.
Breathe out for once and for all.
Fucking die.

You are hope,
And I submit to you.
You are hope,
And I submit.
Now breathe.
And just help me bleed out.
I will never cross this expanse.

You are hope.
You are hope.
And I submit.
Submit.
