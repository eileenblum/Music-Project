A threatening presence still wanders my mind.
Roaming bleak corridors of horror defined.
Nightmarish figure avoiding all sight
Strangely enticing in its own right!

Memories of my past murders, leaving me wanting, and writhing in the cold.
This prison surrounding, built of old stone and covered with wet mould.

A ghost in the darkness I am,
A ghost, before the light!
A ghost in the darkness I am,
A ghost, before the dimming light!

Awaiting my hanging to come, the punishment to tease me.
The noose to be fastened tight round my neck,
Will I rot before the gallows drop?

My mind running to the gallows, where the drop awaits.
The air is good for nothing

A ghost in the darkness I am,
A ghost, before the light!
A ghost in the darkness I am,
A ghost, before the dimming light!

As the midnight fog enters, I choke, but I am still alive!

My mind corrupt, drowning in a fog of depravity and silence.
This long rope tightens tighter round my throat!
My body lies still, yet superstition remains!

Suddenly, one last hate-filled outcry!Your daughters sobbed and wept!
