"Murder!" they screamed.
My mistress' corpse lay there before me!
Her porcelain face, left me with a smile.

Blood drenched; my footsteps are wet with her life.
Fearful; I flee and escape my known consequence.
Her eyes, so lifeless, as I recall in my mind.
Yet, I regret none of my cursed thoughts!
Cursed thoughts.

I can see the light draining from her eyes,
Her ghostly shape arose before me!
Overwhelmed by this horrific sight,
My mind collapses once more into the...

Sanctuary in my mind; release from all truth.
Repeating tragedy from which I cannot refrain.
Now the thought of her is one
More thought to haunt my mind!
Haunt my mind.

The first is always most remembered!
They're sure to hunt me for spilling her blood!

I can see the light draining from her eyes,
A ghostly shape arose before me!
Overwhelmed by this horrific sight,
My mind collapses once more!

A porcelain mistress

An opportunity presented, one fateful night.
No time was wasted, just target in plain sight.
Forty-nine stab wounds, each with more delight.
Acts of most horror, bathed in quicksilver moonlight!
Quicksilver moonlight.
