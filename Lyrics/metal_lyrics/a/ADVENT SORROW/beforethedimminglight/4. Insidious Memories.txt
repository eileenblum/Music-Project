Guided by an unseen hand.
A primeval force, took hold of me.
Driven by ghostly rage.
My blood burned for violenceâ¦ murder.
None stood, in my wake.
Demonic possession.
I delivered my foes to the boatman.
My payment, almost... Complete.

Let me die, erase these memories,
Release me from this hell, let me forget.

Their blood runs down my face,
Their mangled corpses lie before me.
A fearful sight most grim;
The most fitting end; their light grows dim.
The final thing they see;
The eyes of vengeance unfaltering
A puppet of the unseen world,
I become master of their fate.

Let me die, erase these memories,
Release me from this hell, let me forget.

My screams deep set inside
My mind cannot hope to free.
And for their sins,
They will repent.

Let me die, erase these memories,
Release me from this hell, let me forget.
