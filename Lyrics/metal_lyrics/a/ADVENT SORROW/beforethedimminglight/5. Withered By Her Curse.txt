Oh what have I done?!
My nightmarish curse claims another and their blood hunt has begun!
Horrific composition built of murder, haunting me from within.
This most gruesome thought; now a trembling sight,
The last of my mistress left dead in the night!

Cruel and sudden; no pause for thought.
Seize her by her soft, trembling throat.
I taste her salty stream of tears,
I am the manifestation of her earthly fears!

In her final whispers, she begs for her life.
I grant her satisfaction, from the rusted blade of my knife!

Caught in the reflection in her dying eyes,
Was the image of a man and his wife!
For fear of death, they tremble before me.
Suddenly; they flee, the only witnesses to my crime!

Now I must hide, for I have been identified,
My face, an image now carved into their mind!

Oh, I will not painfully repent;
Oh, not when these threatenings can rest so innocent.

Oh; I am the great darkness!
Slaughterer of all that is pure
For I live to hear their spoken cries,
And smile to hear their moan!

Withered by her curse!
My mistress!

From death be born; before my country, I am to hang,
I am the scourge unto the earth. Forever terrors will circle my grave!
