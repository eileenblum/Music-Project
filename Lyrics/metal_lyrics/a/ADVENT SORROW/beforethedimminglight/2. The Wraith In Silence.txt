I see a young woman, writhing before me.
Her white dress, covered in blood.
The wilted moon, exposes this jaded scene.
She approaches, hand in reach, I pray to feel complete.

One night, as I rested my eyes,
These thoughts are haunting.
Delving deeper, into my mind
Shocked by tremendous horror, that I find!

Masked by the silence in me,
Immense, the blackened sky,
Disfigured by death in life,
The We hatches from the I!

Drawing blood from every sight
I feel the need for gore!
An obscure end is far from near,
Why must this desire for pain grow?

This night, as I lay her down to die,
These thoughts are haunting...
