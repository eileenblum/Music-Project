I am the emptiness without beginning or end. Although somatic I break and I bend. I can't be seen. I am around and I mould/form. I am the builder and the creator. Ruler of things. Form giver and taker I can't be felt. I swallow the sound and rape the silence. I build for peace. call for violence. 

I can't be heard I am outside and inside I am flavor and smell. judge and judgment. Heaven and hell. 

I can't be tasted. I am nowhere. Existence follows me. I am everywhere. Existence evades me but still I am.
