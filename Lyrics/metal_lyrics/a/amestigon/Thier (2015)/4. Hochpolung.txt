What have you done to overcome? Ebb of this flood! Turn back into beasts! We are the meaning of the earth. Brethren, remain faithful to the earth! The soul has contempt, cruelty is its lust. Keeps the body meager, ghastly and starved. You flow like a polluted stream. We are the sea to clean this stream. What matters your reason? What matters your virtue? what matters your justice? What matters your pity? The just are flames and fuel. Crowned and nailed for love. We are the lightning, enlighten your path by splitting heaven. You are the rope over the abyss. A dangerous crossing. Your cradle is the beast. You are on the way! Oh brethren, you are the bridge, the arrows longing for the other shore. Donât seek reasons behind the stars. Sacrifice yourself to the earth. You are the spirit of your virtue, so stride the bridge as spirit. We are the mouth for your ears, learn to listen with your eyes. Plant the seed of your highest hope, while your soil is still rich enough. You must have chaos in yourselves, to give birth to a dancing star. Unconscious envy speaks out of those with a squint-eyed glance of contempt. Donât despise your body, create beyond yourselves. Wake and listen! This is the great noon, when you stand in the middle of your way. Let the sun of our knowledge guide you to the evening. So you will meet the new dawn.

Dead are all gods, now we must live. We must overcome. This is our last will!
