Oh brethren and sistren - Await the advent and know thyselves. Creator of the worlds - Immortal serpent. Your light shone in the distance, but was unseen in close proximity. Accumulating the divine, to unite the spear and the chalice. Absorbing the aether until the sun gives birth to jupiter and mercury. Awake the watchman from his slumber. Every tongue shall tell what was witnessed. This spectral power of redeem.

Know thyself. Control thyself. Purify thyself. Come thou to me. Give me thy hands. One less spark is missing. For you to leave behind your hollow shroud.

MANSA MATSYA MUDRA MADYA MAITHUNA The demiurge manifests: as the semen drains into the fire. Inhale the spark and never set it free again. For it won't be the last you will need to set yourself free.
