"Live between the wolf in your heart,
And the cross in your back,
Betrayed by your belief,
Sworn to you arms,
You had never any choice,
You will wonder endlessly...

Fight for the wolf in your heart,
Against the cross in your back,
See the dark side of the soul,
As clear as thou once have seen the day,
Enjoy the pain that lies,
In this tragic beauty of your being,
Fight for the wolf in you heart,
Against the cross in your back...

Death is worth to be worshipped,
And damnation consists of undoubtly truth,
Thou broke the cross and fell, Into everlasting darkness..."
