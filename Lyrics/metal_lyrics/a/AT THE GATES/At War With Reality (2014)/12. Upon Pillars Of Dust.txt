[Verse]
Fragile, quiet and distant as flesh against another
Heroism suppressed, leavin' hunger in its wake
Tired even of sleep
A fragment of life, no more pain!

[Pre-Chorus]
The nights they will drag on
These hands will not abide
A nightmare beckons leavin' death in its wake

[Chorus]
The sickness is a dream
Imprisoned in the deep of the stone
Reality restin' upon pillars of dust
The infinite voracious arms of myth

[Bridge]
Trying to even out sleep
With death in our way

[Chorus]
The sickness is a dream
Imprisoned in the deep of the stone
Reality restin' upon pillars of dust
The infinite voracious arms of myth
