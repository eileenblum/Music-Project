The walls of a poem like the foldin' of wings!
They burn through the base of the skull!

Under the eyelids the night eternal!
Down fell the city of words

The blackness throbbin'
Foul &amp; unrestrained 
Under the seafloor!
Against the white sand 

Where the land has been drinkin'
All our blood &amp; regret 
Our words are like quicksand!
Against the endless sky

The poisonous darkness!
In solid silence
Like rivers of ice!
We burn like blindin' fires 

In the void of my spirit!
Deep in the lungs of Hell to sink like lead!
In the void of my spirit 
Deep in the lungs of hell
Trace-less through the air!
