As parasites we grovel - through the dust
A temple devoured - by the ancient fires
Autumn falls hard on restless flesh
Persistence buried in the sands of time

The grey man kissed the mud
Circular the ruins - in a dawn without birds
Crowned by the deities of death

Streets as cracks in the skin
To drink from the night itself
Webs of perdition - crush the rushing earth
The aching void lures - promising rebirth

Order from chaos - every thought a tool
Order from chaos - profaned by the burned and the dead
