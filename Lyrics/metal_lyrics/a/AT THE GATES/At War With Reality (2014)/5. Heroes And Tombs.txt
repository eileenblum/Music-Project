We are a burning darkness
Swamped by a thousand seas
Mute from fear, hollow and eternal
We sleep forever
The end goes on

Bodies like pillars of dust â disappear once again in the wind
During the night, we move in circles, in unbroken structures

Our beams they sweep across a ravaged earth
As a rhythmic pulse of death â we shudder through the ground

We are a burning darkness
Swamped by a thousand seas
Mute from fear, hollow and eternal

Of heroes and tombs â we sleep forever
Of heroes and tombs â the end goes on

Hollow and eternal
We sleep forever
The end goes on

Of heroes and tombs â we sleep forever
Of heroes and tombs â the end goes on

"I realized that searching was my symbol, the emblem of those who go out at night with nothing in mind, the motives of a destroyer of compasses."
[Julio CortÃ¡zar]
