In this cell that is ours there is no pity
No sunrise on the cold plain that is our soul
No beckoning to a warm horizon
The sun shall never greet my eyes again

It is our world
It has been stolen from us, bastards

No goddamn sun
No goddamn pain
I've searched my heart for love
But all in vain
No goddamn soul, no goddamn pain

Exploring life, without fear
Without feeling I am one with my torment
And forever blind

My desire clenches itself in a hungry fist
And welcomes my soul to the thirst of dying
Mother of all, come take your revenge
The sun shall never greet my eyes again
