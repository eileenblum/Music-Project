A spawn of the alienation
The unspeakable black
Our of the portal of guilt
The ominous, crippling weight

The language of the blood
In a fever black
Monumental and cold
The earth now belongs to the dead

Even in death they shall burn
Their naked, celestial flesh
From the throat of the beast
The architects of the end

In blasphemous slumber
Demoralizing doubts
Reverberating the mythos
The earth now belongs to the dead

Blinding ceremonial fires
Through the darkest of voids
Irreversible dogmas
In hallucination crowned

In death they shall burn
The vortex eternal
In death they shall burn
The earth now belongs to the dead

Even in death they shall burn
A sea of faces black
Out of the fathomless depths
The architects of the end

In blasphemous slumber
Demoralizing doubts
Reverberating the mythos
The earth now belongs to the dead

Blinding ceremonial fires
Through the darkest of voids
Irreversible dogmas
In hallucination crowned

In death they shall burn
The vortex eternal
In death they shall burn
The earth now belongs to the dead

Abandon the ruins of man
The wastelands we left behind
Abandon the ruins of man

In death they shall burn
The vortex eternal
In death they shall burn

In death they shall burn
The vortex eternal
In death they shall burn
The earth now belongs to the dead
