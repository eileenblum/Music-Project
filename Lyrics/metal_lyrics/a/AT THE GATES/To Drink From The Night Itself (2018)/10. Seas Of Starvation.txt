The voiceless, the blind
The cracked mosaic of the end
Fragmented, torn
In rigid shapes they descend

In cataclysmic darkness
The primal blackened void

Shades of black they swarm
Weathered monuments they will sink
Into the seas of starvation
Forever swallowed up in our wake

The tempest released
Streets they hang in the abyss
A sunset burning through
Through the waves of a darkened lens

Unspeakable
The fallen pledges
The never ending deep

Shades of black they swarm
Weathered monuments they will sink
Into the seas of starvation
Forever swallowed up in our wake

Insidious, shapeless
In archaic circles

Beneath a thousand-faced moon
Beneath a thousand-faced moon

A phantasmagoria of the macabre
A phantasmagoria of the macabre
A phantasmagoria of the macabre

The voiceless, the blind
The cracked mosaic of the end
Fragmented, torn
In rigid shapes they descend

Shades of black they swarm
Weathered monuments they will sink
Into the seas of starvation
Forever swallowed in our wake

Into the seas of starvation
Into the seas of starvation
