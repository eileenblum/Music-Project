To perish in dreamless sleep
Dragged through the waste
Doomed, from arrogance blind
Fragmentation of all form

Celestial breath
Disguises lost
Clawing at harmonies dead

Eyes drained by time
Beneath dead waves
Our of the mirror black

Through aeons, crowned in death
And phosphorous doom
Insidious, dominion black
A labyrinth of tombs

As the sentences swarm
In permanent light
The reign of the feverish dream
Hearts of darkness
Beating fast
Our of the mirror nlack

As the sentences swarm
In permanent light
Out of the mirror black

Out of the mirror black
