The distortion, ceremonial
Apathy shaped like a cage
The poisonous cauldron
Emptied with feverish rage

As transparency tears
Through the dead, pungent air
Like storms from the dying past
Frozen circles of timeless despair

In a blur of black wings
They storm out of the past
Infested with the promise of death
Infested with eternal death

The procession never ending
The fatalistic void
In oblivion cloaked
Men forever shaped out of clay

In blind hallucination
Their irreversible truth
Rituals hedonistic
Resignation designed from above

In a blur of black wings
They storm out of the past
Infested with eternal death

In a blur of black wings
They storm out of the past
Infested with the promise of death
Infested with eternal death

Perfection dressed in crippled dreams
Dead rhythms, sharpened to the obscene

On fevered wings
Awakened from our nameless sleep
On fevered wings
Eternal death, to the lords of the keep

In a blur of black wings
They storm out of the past
Infested with eternal death

In a blur of black wings
They storm out of the past
Infested with the promise of death
