The pantheons blind
Ravaged from thirst
They tear through the skies
Through the blackest of nights

Violating rhythms
Far beneath dead waves
The shards of our culture
Abandoned and arcane

Our grave is the darkness
Our own oblivion
The silence pregnant
With a labyrinth of tombs

The ghost of man
Haunts our ravaged tomb
In this labyrinth of our doom

Disharmonic rapture
From forbidden depths
The cabbalistic scriptures
Engraved eternal death

And the pantheons blind
Still tear through the blackest of nights

The ghost of man
Haunts our ravaged tomb
In this labyrinth of our doom

Hunger
The ghost of man
Eternal
Haunts our ravaged tomb
In this labyrinth of our doom

Hunger
The pantheons
Eternal
Ravaged and blind
Hunger
A labyrinth of tombs

Hunger
They tear through the skies
Eternal
Through the blackest of nights
Hunger
A labyrinth of tombs

Hunger
They tear through the skies
Hunger
Through the blackest of nights
Hunger
A labyrinth of tombs

This labyrinth of our doom
This labyrinth of our doom
