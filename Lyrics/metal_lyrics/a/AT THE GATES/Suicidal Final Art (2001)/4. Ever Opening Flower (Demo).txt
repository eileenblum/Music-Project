Ever-opening flower
Feed me seven notes of love
Let its wine burn through my veins
And free my soul from it's pain

Urges rage my fevered mind
Held back by dead note, blind

By the seventh sign of the seventh son
The seventh sun sets forever in the dark sea of my mind

Never shall I smile, never shall I die

Sun be gone, end my world
Enter darkness, rich of pain
I'm eternal, forever to be free
I'm one with fire, a thousand suns burn in me

Ever-opening flower
Feed me seven notes of love
Urges rage in my mind
Held back dead notes, blind
