"God"
"Creator"
Deceiver, you are the sinner.
I cast you down from your throne of lies
And accuse you of a thousand sins
Perished in the flames of what you call Hell
I proclaim your kingdom as lost forever

A thousand Colours invade
All different, all dark
A black sun is now rising
Reality unfolds

Kingdom Gone

Absolute Spirit, we revolt against thee
We are the serpent gods, Wall spawned from you
I am the new messiah, and I will baptize you in sin
We wanted a place in your creation but you wouldn't let us in

With one caress I draw the life from your flesh
With one stroke I render your bones to dust
Kingdom Gone

In the light of the black sun
The seas of starvation start to boil
A new dimension is born,
We die, we learn and are born again

Inverted we've lived our lives
From our death to our birth
Now the liars are awakening
We are the children of "God's" curse

With our caress you greet the slaves of your creation
With one stroke you punish us for your sins
Kingdom Gone

The black gate is closed

Inverted we've lived our lives
From our death to our birth
Now the liars are awakening
We are the children of "God's" curse

I proclaim your kingdom as lost forever

A thousands different colours invade
All different, All dark
A black sun is now rising
Reality unfolds

Kingdom Gone
