Ride the wind
My aggressions mirrored themselves in her eyes
As the blade was ripping up her insides

Her eyes
Stabbing and stabbing
My love fell dead to the floor
Together with sheds of my sanity
Dead in the abscence of agony

She's still here with me
As Hell turns to ice

Her dead eyes staring deep into my soul
Into the carved out hole
Sweeping forth, The wind without no name

my mind is raped by insanity

Now her blood flows in my veins
Her heart beats in my chest
Her voice screaqms within my mind
The wind without no name

Ride the wind

Now time itself touches my soul
It's ice cold breeath in my ear
Oh, "God" I'm sorry, I lost control
I slayed love disguised as fear

The fire still burns within my soul
No wind to put it out

Now time itself touches my soul
It's ice cold breeath in my ear
Oh, "God" I'm sorry, I lost control
I slayed love disguised as fear
