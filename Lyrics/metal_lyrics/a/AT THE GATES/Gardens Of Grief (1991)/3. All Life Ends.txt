My life fades, my visions dim
all that remains are memories
I remember a time of chaos
time of war
as men began to feed on man
only the scavengers survived
gone now, swept away
for reasons long forgotten
touched of a blase
which engulfed them all
a firestorm of fear
the answer is written in their bones
all life ends
I remember an old man
griping my wrist, he was dying
"imagine", he said
"looking into the eyes of a nova,
the bursting flames, the roar of it's energy
frintly echoing down the corridors of time,
whispering: all life ends
"death, he said "is like a bolt of lightning,
Light cast upon every secret,
just for a moment, till the last spark of life fades
and all is dark..."
then he breathed out his last breath into my ear
his gaze already way out among the stars...
among the ruins of the past
I shelter from the storm
my mind is numb from the lonliness
and the rain that never stops
this wasteland, once a beautiful place
where trees and flowers grew
where deer, and squirells had their home
now rotting are their bones
Where raging waters grind the earth
I go to end my days
the sea that witnessed mankinds birth
shall watch us die again
black and deep,
empty of life
as in the heaven so below
the sun has now forever set
and bids our time to go
I am tired
and I fear not
the cold that now descends
as light grows dim, I bid farewell
all life ends
I am leaving now, my body stiff
just watching for a while
that rigid shell, so small and weak
a corpse on a broken cliff
the stars are calling me now
with distant, speechless voices
and caught by a wind I drift away
and nothing calls me to stay...
I am ridint the wind that has no name,
the fire that burns without a flame
caught by the spell on which all depends,
all life ends
the answer is written in my bones,
all life ends
