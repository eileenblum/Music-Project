Jesus, no prince of my starved Hell to be
No way, my world it dies with me

Far beyond your eyes they seek
Beyond bonds of stars and skies
The kingdom where nothing dies

I am the stars burning evil in your heart
Beyond good and evil, we will never part
For every man and woman is a star
'Cause I burn inside you all, we will never part
