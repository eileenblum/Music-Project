Slit open the skies and let out my stars

The night dies inside me
She's got ways to make me crawl
I respond like a machine

The sun shines from a thin sky
And these feelings they die
In the minds of the blind
Patterns red of love so dead

Under the floors, the dark woodsthey come back
Dark they needn't be, but your virgin blood is dead
The spark faded and gone

All the stars in her skin
The repulsion as I sin
She's roaring through my soul
All dressed in thoughts of flesh

With a beautiful wound I was born
It was all that I knew to own

Stardrowned

All the stars in her skin
The repulsion as I sin
She's roaring through my soul
Sears my nakedness my flesh

Stardrowned
