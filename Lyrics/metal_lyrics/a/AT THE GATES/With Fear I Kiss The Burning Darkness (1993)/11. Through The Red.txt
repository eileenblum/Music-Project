Eternal flames won't clense my soul

Racing through me, burning me
Unpure I'll shine forever
Wild darkness boils in my veins so tired

Through the red
With fires of dawn burning in my eyes
Through the red
Burning me

All faces turn black
I refuse to breathe
Cleanse me

Thanks to seemedothis2 for sending track #6 lyrics.
