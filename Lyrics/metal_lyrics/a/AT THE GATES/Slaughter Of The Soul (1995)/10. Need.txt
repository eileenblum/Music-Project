'...Because of my love for all living
...I choose to die...'

Open me, with your kiss of steel
End my pain - set me free

For we are enslaved, forever enslaved

Open me, with your kiss of steel
End my pain - set me free
Live only to die some more
Need - killing yourself to live

For we are enslaved, forever enslaved

Lay your fears to rest.. fears to rest
Let your dreams awake... dreams awake

For we are enslaved, forever enslaved

Lay your hate to rest - open me...
