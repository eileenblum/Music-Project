You hold high the banner of self-deceit
Encaged in the dogmas of life, you join the elite

[Chorus:]
My Judas-window stays shut - shut forever more
My Judas-window stays shut - shut forever more

You mock the weak for not giving you their trust
In your world of make believe, where statues turn to dust

[Chorus:]

You walk through what is me
Stare blind - cannot see
Your thoughts flee to a different land
They are free, but you are bound

Silenced forever, the walls are closing in
The keys to our damnation - burial... burial within

[Chorus:]

...shut forever more
