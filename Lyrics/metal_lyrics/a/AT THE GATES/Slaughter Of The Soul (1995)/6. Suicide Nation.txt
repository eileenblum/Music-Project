Utopia - lost in chaos
As the sky turns black
Suicide legacy
There is no turning back
...no turning back

[Chorus:]
Retribution answers cold
Moving in for the kill
Deep hideous festering
Bestial spidemic, repulsive need

Control, control

Suicide nation
Mass-appeal, death-addiction
Dead but dreaming
Restrained by phobia, brainwashed into submission

Control, control

Suicide - jaws locked around your spine
...locked around your spine

'The face of evil is always the face of total need...'
[W.S.Burroughs, 'Deposition: Testimony concerning a sickness']

[Chorus:]

Control, control

Suicide - jaws locked around your spine
