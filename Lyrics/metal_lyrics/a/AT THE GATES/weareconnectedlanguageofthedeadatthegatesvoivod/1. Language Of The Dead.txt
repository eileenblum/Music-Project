[performed by At the Gates]THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT
AND ALL OUR MODELS OF FEAR
A GENERATION BURIED
BEHIND THE RING OF A CITY DEAD
NOW PIERCING THE SILENCE
THE MAP OF OUR NIGHTMARE UNFOLDS
AND OUR BLACK AND WHITE LIVES
ARE SUSPENDED IN DREAMS

CLOAKED IN THE TONGUE OF THE DEAD
HIS VOICE LIKE A SCAR THROUGH THE DARK
AS WEIGHTLESS EYES WATCHING
PREGNANT WITH DOOM - THE NIGHT
NOW PIERCING THE SILENCE
THE MAP OF OUR NIGHTMARE UNFOLDS
AND OUR BLACK AND WHITE LIVES
ARE SUSPENDED IN DREAMS

THE RESOLUTION OF CONCEPTS
A WORLD WITHOUT END IS REBORN
REMNANTS OF LIFE
UNBEARABLE TO ITSELF

AND THE COILS OF THE SERPENT
UNWIND THE STRUCTURES OF FEAR
OUR GENERATION HOLLOW
WITHIN THE REALMS OF A CITY DEAD
LANGUAGE IS WEAKNESS
A CONSEQUENCE OF HINDERED THOUGHTS
THE REVERSAL PERPETUAL
THE WORLD RISES OUT OF ITS DARKNESS

THE RESOLUTION OF CONCEPTS
A WORLD WITHOUT END IS REBORN
REMNANTS OF LIFE
UNBEARABLE TO ITSELF
