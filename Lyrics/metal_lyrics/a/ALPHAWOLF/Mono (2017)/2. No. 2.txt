We fell in monochrome chaos
Selfishness brought resentment
But I do miss our moments in which we fell in unison

Your name is scarred on my heart
But please know I always loved you from the start

I'm so sorry dear, I never meant for this
Awake and missing you
Perpetual rest come gracefully
But please just know that I'm so sorry

3 AM artificial junctures instead of the astral plain
Fearing my grave in which my mind will lay

Painkillers are killing me, probably because the pain is me
Tell me that you love me, even though you're lying through your teeth

Acute mental attunement, I swallowed all these pills for you

You still had love to show, I still had blood to bleed
If you had so much love to show, why hold it to me?

You were my number one, you place me number two
My anxiety separated me from you
Cut it loose

My sounds still shackled to you

You were my number one, you place me number two
I loved how when you let me down, you took everything too

Eye, visualise ruining a fucking home
How does it feel to be the one with the second best?
