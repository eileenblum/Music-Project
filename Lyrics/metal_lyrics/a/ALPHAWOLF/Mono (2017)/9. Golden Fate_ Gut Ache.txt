I should have been there and I know it, there is no way to transpose it
Another text, another swipe to the left
I should have been there and I know it
The warning signs were there, I should have cared

I never thought you would let go
Your perceived strength was it all for show?

I know it was hard for you
And when I gave up you gave up too
And when I gave up you gave up too

My tunnel vision was vital leading you to desolation
And I wish I was there, all you wanted was resuscitation
Losing the self in constant oppression
My heart still mourns at the fault

Resent me
Resent me

I know it was hard for you
And when I gave up you gave up too
And when I gave up you gave up too

If I could turn back time, I wouldn't have run away (I'm sorry)
