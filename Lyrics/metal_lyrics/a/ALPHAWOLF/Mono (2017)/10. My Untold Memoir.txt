Four men and still you were heavy
This was the one day I could near be ready
My brother, weeping in the distance
Our family, I'm really going to miss this
I stared at your name engraved in the casket
This can't be real, this sadness I must mask it
They lowered you down, accompanied by a song
And every time I hear those chords it hurts for so long
Your friends bid farewell by dousing you with flowers
These few moments felt more like hours
Greeting these people whom I barely knew
One thing was missing and it was you.
I love you
