Neglected, abused, unspoken, recluse
Neglected, abused, unspoken, recluse
I'm a ward of the state motherfucker
Misunderstood and misread
I just want my own bed
The brain scans will have you lost inside my head

Where is help? Where is my guidance?
Where is someone who'll show me where the light is?
These walls are not my home
I've never felt so alone

I'm a ward of the state
