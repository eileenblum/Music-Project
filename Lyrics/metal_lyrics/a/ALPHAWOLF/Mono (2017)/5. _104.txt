It's live alone and die
With my heart on the outside
It's live alone and die
The choice of caskets threw me and left an empty reject
Made from missing mothers
I am now a defect
It's live alone and die

Quarter life lived, I'm a shell with no inside
Crying out for help but yeah, you don't realise
Years of pain and torment have you looked in my eyes?
Jump the lonely queue, bones hard to find
Okay you say? You've lost reality this day (no progress)
When there's nothing left to pretend, I've found I'm in love with my
depression

I pick myself up off the bathroom floor
Grit my fucking teeth, then put my head through the concrete wall
Grit my fucking teeth, then put my head through the concrete wall

I'm sorry it's lonely spending your time with me
Time flies pre-incarnated theories of Gauchais Reactions
I've got nothing to hold me
Let me go, tilt and grow, let me go I'm about to let go
Tilt an grow, let me go, tilt and grow

I pick myself up off the bathroom floor, look me up
I'm #104

Maybe I should just you know...

Click back barrel to the head? Maybe wrap some wire around the neck?
Suicide mosaic, make art with me
God without you I'm so lonely
