This house, so fucking quiet
Death manifesting my thoughts
The breeze pushes on, moments lost
I stare at the glass, I see myself and see no other

These walls, these memories
Those holes, forget those holes
But this god shaped hole, found buried like a dark sigil within me
A broken mirror, distorted basket case
Our shielded skin is a thing of the past

Picture hooks where our photograph hung hook my soul from within

I am the decayed son

To bear witness to this, a life succumbed to this
Top to bottom, cardboard boxes, webs on the letterbox
The only thing stopping my dangling feet is having "Take Me Away" by Plot on repeat
I know I'm not the only one who's lost someone they love

If I can learn from this, then I will teach you this
Take all the time to reminisce
Take all the time to reminisce
Take all the time to reminisce

Grab someone you love, tell them that you love them and make sure that you mean it
I did that, I never got to fucking say goodbye

We are the dead generation, we're barely breathing and heavily grieving
You can count on us if you feel like you're lost
You haven't heard the last of us
