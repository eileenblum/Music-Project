Sometimes I sit here and wonder if things were to be different
If I gave you more attention, if I wasn't so selfish
Could I really have been your lover?
Entwined to one another
Instead we lost ourselves
Lost ourselves and lost each other

The thoughts in my head
A sickened feeling of regret
Lovesick from love
I'm lovesick from love

This feeling is something I'll never forget
Please forget me
