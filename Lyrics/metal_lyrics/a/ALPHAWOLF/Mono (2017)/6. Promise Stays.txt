No sleep, whilst the promise stays
Pale skin upon a fragmented body
I extirpated what love told me
Knowingly, you were my melancholy
Knowingly, you were my melancholy

Sleep without you isn't right to me
I want you inside my head, a fallacious ghost I will see when I'm dead
These words come in black and white, reverberated and monochrome through my mind
Tailored to your broken sight, retribution for redemption
Not immune to lack of repentance, not how I hoped to be

No sleep, whilst the promise stays
Pale skin upon a fragmented body
I extirpated what love told me
Knowingly, you were my melancholy

Sleep without you isn't right to me

Fallacy they whisper in the ear of a recluse
My own perspective endures from chemical abuse
The nostalgia with this is no friend to I
No martyr complex, just the cycle of despair in your eyes

Sleep without you isn't right to me

No sleep, whilst the promise stays
Pale skin upon a fragmented body

Sleep without you isn't right to me
