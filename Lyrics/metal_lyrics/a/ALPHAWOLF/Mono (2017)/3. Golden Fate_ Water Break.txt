You were my everything and you knew it
What did I do for this to be given?
No longer bound to this earth
No longer with me in remission
Here we go again, another loss, another false purpose
Here we go again, another metaphor for the absent
I slit my throat with the note that you left me
Not home, just a tilt shift monstrosity
I'll see you again if God doesn't hate me
Reaper show me your rib cage
They say it keeps the heart safe
Extortion's void, I've seen you pray
To rid the pain of a lover maimed
Consumed by cinder, a malicious defeater
It torched our home, like the rope burn around my neck
Brought upon the ash of cosmetic loss
Came a scar from the mind to the bone
And I hope you know, I can't do this on my own
You were my everything and you knew it
What did I do for this to be given?
No longer bound to the earth
Not one last conversation
You knew this from the start
It would break all our hearts
You knew this from the start (it's too goddamn far)
It would break all of our hearts (break all of our hearts)
I've got this hole in my chest, it's missing you I swear
Please come back home to me
