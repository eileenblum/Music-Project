In their eyes of children is a world I wish could be
Their definitions of this life derived so simply
There's no one to hurt them and everything is fair
The cruelty around them seems hidden from their stare

[Chorus:]
In their eyes I see a world where every man is free
In their eyes I see a better place for you and me
In their eyes I see a world where no one has to die
In their eyes I see a place where there's never need to lie

But as they grow this vision changes with every passing year
Each misconception lost with shedding of a tear
A world that once seemed safe is revealed to be so cold
In a world disfigured by simply growing old

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Lykins]

The simple definitions of this world you think you know
Will surely start to cramble as your youthful body grows
Love for you is simple, it supplies you with your needs
In our world it's lethal for it bites the hand that feeds

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Skowron]
