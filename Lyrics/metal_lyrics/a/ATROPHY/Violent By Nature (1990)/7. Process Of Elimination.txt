Our forefathers came with a vision and dream, to settle on this land
They built a great nation with blood and sweat, to benifit all of man
A path of destruction they did not see, they did not understand
Live for the moment instead of the future, typical for all of man

[Chorus:]
Overpopulation will soon take its toll
The growth of mankind is simply out of control
Soon no where to turn, we run short of precious land
Take our complex problems and place them in our children's hands

Living on a dream, a final prayer, future lies unseen
Hope to make a difference in our lives, its up to you and me
Destroying ourselves day by day, can we change at all
Hope for the best and keep on fighting before we take a fall

[Repeat chorus]

In the past, wars were benifical, man's its only enemy
Without this devastation we have inequality
People live longer thatn yeasterday, their offspring on the rise
It's mordern science, will it be answer or will it be our demise

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Skowron]
[Repeat third verse]
[Repeat chorus]
