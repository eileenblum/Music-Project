Forced to deal with decisions you never thought come true
Abandoned by the ones you've trusted, no one's there for you
Internal maelstrom of confusion, unsure of who you are
The things you used in definition didn't take you very far

[Chorus:]
The things I felt before I'm not sure if they're there
Words which meant so much fall on ears which just don't care
Emotions all entangled, it's time to reearrange
The seasons pass, emotions die, I'm helpless as things change

We often times define ourselves by our titles and our friends
We place our trust in fallacies which eventually will end
But just like dreams that fade away with every morning's light
We're left with only memories, no tangibles in sight

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Lykins]

Now I find I'm all alone and wondering what is real
Insecure of who I am, afraid of what I feel
But I'm on the path to knowledge, the darkness won't last longer
That which does not kill me, only makes me stronger

[Repeat chorus]

Things change
Things change
Things change
Things change
