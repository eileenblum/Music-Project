Locked away, I'm hidden from your sight
Forced to live in artificial light
Made to suffer because of what I'm not
A casualty in a war that must be fought
So here I wait like the ones that came before
And when I'm gone they'll need a thousand more
You've decided that my life is yours to take
So now I'm trapped in a world I did not make

[Chorus:]
Let me go
Leave me be
Stop your tests
Set me free

In my cell, I'm waiting for your tests
What hidden law makes you better than the rest
You feed me drugs and see how I behaveâ
And test my blood to and see what you have made
Day by day situation growing worse
You weren't content to let nature take its course
Now you suffer by the toxins that you use
Terrified by the fate that you helped choose

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Skowron]
[Repeat verse]
[Repeat chorus]
