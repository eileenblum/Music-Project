At the age of 15 your life is defined, it's measured in ounces and grams
The wisdom of ages is soon pushed away for a crystal that's purchased in drams
No time for book learning, the street is your school, it teaches a lesson that's real
You shun lit and science, that's crap for your parents, the only thing real is the deal

[Chorus:]
Words on a page, they're so hard to read
The will to learn, it's not in your creed
Why should I care, I reeally can't see
The teaching of man, they mean nothing to me

Sports is the answer that's what you've been told,
It's the only way you'll succeed
A ball is your teacher, replaces the textbook,
It's the only tool that you'll need
History and math are soon pushed away by the glory bestowed by a sport
The classroom's forgotten, their teachings outdated,
You live by the rules of the court

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Skowron]
[Solo: Lykins]

Although things aren't perfect, they're trying their best,
The choice is left up to you
Resist the temptation of the easy way out,
The promises made just aren't true
You've made your decision have given up trying
And now there is no turning back
Another statistic for our failing system,
Another that's slipped through the cracks

[Repeat chorus ]
