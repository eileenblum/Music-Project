Trapped in my mind, the answers you won't find
Deep despair, what I feel, lost in time, what I'm feeling
Emotions lost all meaning, can not help what I'm feeling
Tortured by pain, this agony is so insane

[Chorus:]
Diminishing away, day by day
A life once fulfilling now stripped away
It it's certain I must die
I deserve the right to die
Thousands of dollars everyday
To keep me suffering in a life of pain
I lie rotting be disease, eats away piece by pice
Just leave me be

Living through this Hell, life unravels, just as well
Politics of man won't let me die, they just prolong my demise
A life I did not choose, but it is certain I will lose
A disgrace to myself it I take my family through this hell

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Lykins]
[Repeat first verse]
[Repeat chorus]
