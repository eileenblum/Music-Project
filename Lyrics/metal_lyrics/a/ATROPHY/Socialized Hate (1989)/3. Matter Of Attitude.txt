[Music and lyrics: Chris Lykins]

Always put others down, passing out the blame
Ignorance and your attitude make you all the same
Never try to befriend, never lend a hand
Draw so many barriers, I'll never understand

[Chorus:]
Why won't you listen
Why can't you hear
I guess your scene won't let you
Is change what you fear?

You say your scene preaches individuality
The more I see the more I know thats not reality
I walk into your parties, I guess I don't look right
No one even talks to me, no one meets my sight
What makes me so different, so much I can't fit in
Is having different hair and clothes such a mortal sin
Tell me what's wrong with me I'd reeally like to know
I'm trying to be your friend not another foe

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Rick]

Always put others down, passing out the blame
Ignorance and your attitude make you all the same
Never try to befriend, never lend a hand
Draw so many barriers, I'll never understand
You say your scene preaches individuality
The more I see the more I know thats not reality
I walk into your parties, I guess I don't look right
No one even talks to me, no one meets my sight

[Repeat chorus]
