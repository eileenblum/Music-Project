[Music: Chris Lykins]
[Lyrics: David Lehman]

Beer bong - suck it down
Beer bong - don't do it wrong
Beer bong - don't take too long
or else you'll drown
Beer bong - gulp it down
Beer bong - if you can
Beer bong - make it vanish
if you're a man

[Chorus:]
Heidelberg
Dutch Treat
Black Label

Beer bong - it's very clear
Beer bong - you must be daring
Beer bong - or else the beer
you'll be wearing
Beer bong - and tomorrow
Beer bong - when I wake
Beer bong - to my sorrow
my head will ache

[Chorus:]
Meister Brau
Blatz
Grain Belt

[Solo: Rick]

[Chorus:]
Old Milwaukee
Pearl
Shaeffer
