[Music: Chris Lykins, James Gulotta]
[Lyrics: Chris Lykins]

Our land, our home, America the free
Our vote decides the future can't you see
Their sim to serve, and protect what is theirs
Too much at stake to let others have their share
The world is more than colors black and red
Profit and gain mean little to those dead
While you cut corners to maximize your gain
Your lack of caring sends young men to their graves

[Chorus:]
Spend all our money on functionless weapons
They never care what the cost
I guess it's too bad it works only on paper
It's our lives not theirs that are lost
The truth is that we're powerless to change
The joke that the pentagons became
To win a war is the last thing on their mind
Career advancement is the main thing you will find
500 million dollars every day
Drains the resourses from projects such as AIDS
Our poor go hungry in cities across the states
Defense contractors steal the food
right off their plates

[Chorus:]

[Solo: Rick]
[Repeat 1st verse]

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Chris]
