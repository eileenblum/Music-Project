[Lyrics: Chris Lykins]

Work your ass off every day
Nothing do you own
Sold your soul to the system
Another fucking clone
Never ask for nothing
Yet you gave and gave
Now you're trapped
Ambitions shattered
Another mindless slave

[Chorus:]
You never asked for anything
And that's exactly what you got
They never cared for you
They're glad to see you rot
Nothing's really yours
It's only mortgages and leases
When you die
Then you rest in pieces
Line their pockets with your labor
You go home in debt
Your children die from malnutrition
Your bosses never wept
They justify the life you lead
A life that's full of pain
You were born to serve your master
Your caste revealed by name

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Rick]

Sick of their oppression
You come to take what's your
Rip their hearts from their body's
Their blood pools on the floor
A smile plays across your lips
Their life breath slowly ceases
Leave their mansion a free man
As they rest in pieces

[Repeat chorus]
