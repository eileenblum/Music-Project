[Music: James Gulotta]
[Lyrics: Brian Zimmerman, Chris Lykins]

Your life begins at 17, you enlist with Uncle Sam
Trained for battle, prepared to die, you don't give a damn.
Your weapon is your life and love shooting the enemy down.
Killing women and children and everyting around
First fought for freedom now for pleasure, you've become obsessed
Never feel at ease until you're laid to rest
Sargeant tells you and you carry out his every command.
No return from this life you're on the 4 year plan.

[Chorus:]
Born to kill
There's no retreat
Live to fight
A Killing machine

Politicians play a deadly game now
you play it too
Once you die, you're forgotten they'll find somebody new
Seeing through different eyes much better than the old
Block out all the needles carnage
your heart grows cold
Stripped of your humanity, no choice but to obey
Turned into a predator, civilians are your prey

[Repeat Chorus]

[1st solo: Chris]
[2nd solo: Rick]

Seeing through different eyes much better than the old
Block out all the needles carnage
your heart grows cold
Stripped of your humanity, no choice but to obey
Turned into a predator, civilians are your prey
Politicians play a deadly game now
you play it too
Once you die, you're forgotten they'll find somebody new

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo: Rick]
