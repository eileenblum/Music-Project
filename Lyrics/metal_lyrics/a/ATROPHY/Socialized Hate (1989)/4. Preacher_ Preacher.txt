[Lyrics: Brian Zimmerman, Chris Lykins]

Preacher tell me no lies
Send me more money
Or else I will die
You go to church every day
Trying to find god
So you give them your pay
I'll tell you evil
Yet I do no wrong
Chapter fifteen
Let's sing another song
Have my own show
Even make videos
Just more money
To stick up my nose

[Chorus:]
He's not afraid to lie
Greed is the reason why
My wife's recovering from coke
I buy it for my family
But I'll never go broke
People come for help they say
You take their money
And you send them away
I have a few billion
Not much to me
I need a lot more
Thanks to my greed
Have fourteen houses
And fifteen cars
Lay back in my mansion
And watch people starve

[Repeat Chorus]

[1st solo: Chris]
[2nd solo: Rick]

[Repeat chorus]
