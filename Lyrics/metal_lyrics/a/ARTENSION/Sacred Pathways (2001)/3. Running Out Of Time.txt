Now that my life is changing
Something is missing
Driving me insane
These feelings in my brain

Dark fear...so real
Sanity lives so far away from here

Dangerous age, I'm running out of time
The world is in my stage, but I'm running out of,
Running out of time

Somehow the light is fading
To unholy darkness
Night destroys the day
It's so hard to find my way

Dark fear...so real
Sanity lives so far away from here

Dangerous age, I'm running out of time
The world is in my stage, but I'm running out of,
Running out of time
