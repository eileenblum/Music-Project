Why do you run from the light?
All of the mystery's been revealed
So many pray for your life
Some had claimed you died

Live life as you were
No return

Now on your way, love is fading
So far away from me
And on the wind, flags are waving
Honoring your victory...Your victory

It's so hard to say what is right
With all of the truths
that have been concealed
Don't care what's black or what's white
I've been color blind

Live life without debt
No regret

Now on your way, love is fading
So far away from me
And on the wind, flags are waving
Honoring your victory...Your victory
