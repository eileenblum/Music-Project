Now I know where the spirit goes
Flying on the wind, until it's born again

Dark world, I have seen the other side
A cold light, an endless night
Until it's born again

Fly on, spirit
Fly on, spirit

Before the storm, the calm is deafening
Before the storm, the calm is deafening

So sad that everyone we love must die
Hearts sigh, and souls they cry
Until they've born again

Fly on, spirit
Fly on, spirit

Before the storm, the calm is deafening
Before the storm, the calm is deafening

Fly on!

Fly on, spirit
Fly on, spirit

Before the storm, the calm is deafening
Before the storm, the calm is deafening

Until they're born again
Spirit, fly on
On through the storm
