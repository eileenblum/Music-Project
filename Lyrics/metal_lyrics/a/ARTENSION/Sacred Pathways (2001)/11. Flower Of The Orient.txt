He was just a travelin' man
On the island of Japan
Asian beauty caught his eye
Stole his heart, he could not lie

Tall blonde American
Living in a foreign land
She was just a lonely girl
Wanting to see the world

And he will...and she will
Love forever

Yoko-san, in the land of the rising sun
Tell me why do you run from my heart?
Tell me why, my Yoko-san

Wrote a poem, and had it sent
Poured his heart out through his pen
She never heard such words before
"Have it all and so much more"

Flower of the orient
Now you know what these words meant
Will you be my destiny?
Oh, perfect harmony

And he will...and she will
Love forever

Yoko-san, in the land of the rising sun
Tell me why do you run from my heart?
Tell me why, my Yoko-san

He was born and raised to fight
Changed her future in one night
Live in peace forever more
Hearts grew wings and start to soar

And he will...and she will
Love forever

Yoko-san, in the land of the rising sun
Tell me why do you run from my heart?
Tell me why, my Yoko-san
Tell me why...Yoko-san...oh baby
