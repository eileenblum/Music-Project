In your dreams, does everything seem...
Black and white?...Dark as night?
Does morning seem far away?
Cold and damp?...
Racing back to where your world is safe

Nightmare, always the same for me
Falling, throw me a line
Save me, give me the sense to see
Nightmare, never come near to me

Far away, the warm light of day
Round and round
Fear sinking down to when you were a child
Run and hide
Locked up inside
The horror seems so real

Nightmare, always the same for me
Falling, throw me a line
Save me, give me the sense to see
Nightmare, never come near to me

Nightmare, always the same for me
Falling, throw me a line
Save me, give me the sense to see
Nightmare, never come near to me

Nightmare...the horror seems so real
Throw me a line...I'm fallin' fallin' fallin'
Ever so real to me, always haunting me
In my dreams...everything seems
