He rules the night, and watches by daylight
No man shall challenge the throne

Born to be royalty

All hail the emperor!
Lord and master
All hail the emperor!
Now you know just what your life's worth

Guardian of life, deliver us all from our evils
No one shall question his word

Born to be royalty

All hail the emperor!
Lord and master
All hail the emperor!
Now you know just what your life's worth

"Guardian of life watch over us by daylight
No man shall challenge your throne, or question your word
Deliver us all from our evils, oh Emperor"
