Dark cloud is covering the sky
And I feel, now there is no end in sight

Don't turn and run away
You'll never know
Won't let you leave this place
No, not alive!

Come and join the killing
Not without a fight
Welcome to the killing
You won't leave with your life

Broadheads are sharper than a knife
At full draw, and I've got you in my sights

Don't turn and run away
You'll never know
Won't let you leave this place
No, not alive!

Come and join the killing
Due respect for life
Welcome to the killing
You won't leave with your life
