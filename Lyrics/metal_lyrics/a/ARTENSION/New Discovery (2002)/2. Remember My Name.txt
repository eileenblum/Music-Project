You can run, but never hide
You'll always come back to me
Swallow your pride
But if you go, just stay gone
Won't know what you mean to me
Hell and Beyond

I flow through your veins
Like a moth drawn to the flame

You'll never be the same, it's coming to you
Always remember, remember my name
Do you know the game?
'Cuz I'm the winner
Will you remember, remember my name?

You never knew, it's hard to find
You threw it away and now you're looking behind
But if you will, just hold on
You'll know what you did to me now...that I'm gone

I flow through your veins
Like a moth drawn to the flame

You'll never be the same, it's coming to you
Always remember, remember my name
Do you know the game?
'Cuz I'm the winner
Will you remember, remember my name?

You'll never be the same, it's coming to you
Always remember, remember my name
Do you know the game?
'Cuz I'm the winner
Will you remember, remember my name?
