Here and now - Now is the time to decide
Are you falling away from me?
There was a time I could see deep in your eyes
But now my reflection is all I can see

Only the dream remains

Innocence Lost - The stakes got higher
Innocence Lost - The straits are dire
Innocence Lost

Where and when - Tell me just what does it mean?
When will the answer be clear in my mind?
That was then - This is now and I am sure
I will know everything in its own time

Only the dream remains

Innocence Lost - The stakes got higher
Innocence Lost - The straits are dire
Innocence Lost

Here and now - Now is the time to decide
Are you falling away from me?
There was a time I could see deep in your eyes
But now my reflection is all I can see

Only the dream remains

Innocence Lost - The stakes got higher
Innocence Lost - The straits are dire
Innocence Lost

Innocence Lost - The stakes got higher
Innocence Lost - The straits are dire
Innocence Lost
