Don't need the man to tell me where I've been
Never needed maps to find my way
Give me the reason...When'd it all begin?
We reached the limit in one day

I'll never tell you where we go
I'll never show you things I know
So many secrets in the game
Are they all the same?

You know, it feels like home
Call Of The Wild
You see, I'm right at home
Call Of The Wild

I left the city lights far behind me
Packed up the gear to get away
Didn't need a reason...I'd do it all again
Don't try to stand there in my way

I'll never tell you where we go
I'll never show you things I know
So many secrets in the game
Are they all the same?

You know, it feels like home
Call Of The Wild
You see, I'm right at home
Call Of The Wild

I'll never tell you where we go
I'll never show you things I know
So many secrets in the game
Are they all the same?

You know, it feels like home
Call Of The Wild
You see, I'm right at home
Call Of The Wild
