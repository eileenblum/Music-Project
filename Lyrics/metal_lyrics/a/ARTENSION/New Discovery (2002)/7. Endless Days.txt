You never thought I'd ever get over you
But one day, found my way 
and started new

Now everything's complete
I'm living life so free
Like sunlight through the haze

The Endless Days
The Endless Days

I see you and start to fall apart
In prison, my vision was in the dark

Now everything's so sweet
I'm living life for me
And finally through the maze

The Endless Days
The Endless Days
Like sunlight through the haze
And finally through the maze

The Endless Days
The Endless Days
Like sunlight through the haze
And finally through the maze
