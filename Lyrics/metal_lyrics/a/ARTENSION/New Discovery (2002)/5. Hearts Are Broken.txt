Have you ever felt so alone?
With no place you can call your home
Naked in the pouring rain
And nothing is going to ease your pain

Chances fading away

Hearts are broken
Hearts are broken

All by myself in an empty room
Like some pharaoh burned in a tomb
Everything or not at all
And nothing is going to stop your fall

Chances fading away

Hearts are broken
Hearts are broken

And lately the gleam is gone 
from your eyes
Even your smile cannot disguise
The heart that's broken

Hearts are broken
Hearts are broken
