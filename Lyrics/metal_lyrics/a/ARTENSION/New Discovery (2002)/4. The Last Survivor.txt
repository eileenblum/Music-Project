Creatures of the night,
welcome to the light
Blinded by the glow of this holy sight

Guardian of history, weather the storm
Into the battle, go it alone

The darkness fading

The Last Survivor
Carry the bloodline all alone
The Last Survivor
You'll never quit 'til seeds are sewn

Stand the test of time, living is the crime
'Til you reach the end, no hill left to climb

Guardian of history, weather the storm
Into the battle, go it alone

The darkness fading

The Last Survivor
Carry the bloodline all alone
The Last Survivor
You'll never quit 'til seeds are sewn
You're the Last Survivor

The Last Survivor
Carry the bloodline all alone
The Last Survivor
You'll never quit 'til seeds are sewn
