All of the pages have been turned
And all of the stories have been told
I know you've been waiting, waiting so long
Down through the ages...words like gold...words like gold

All of the books that I have read
Stored in the memory of my mind
I know they've been fading...fading so far
Deep down inside me...what will I find?

Story Teller they call me
Light of the fire in my eyes
Story Teller they call me
And I will...And I will

All of the pages have been turned
And all of the stories have been told
I know you've been waiting, waiting so long
Down through the ages...words like gold...words like gold

Story Teller they call me
Light of the fire in my eyes
Story Teller they call me
And I will...And I will

Story Teller they call me
Light of the fire in my eyes
Story Teller they call me
And I will...And I will
