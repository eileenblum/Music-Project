It's dawning the start of a new age
Millennium's calling calling to you

Don't let this chance slip away
The rest of your life starts today

It's time to tell the truth
And nothing but the truth

Deception misleading the people
Honest confession wounds that can heal

Don't let this chance slip away
The rest of your life starts today

It's time to tell the truth
And nothing but the truth

It's dawning the start of a new age
Millennium's calling calling to you

Don't let this chance slip away
The rest of your life starts today

It's time to tell the truth
And nothing but the truth
