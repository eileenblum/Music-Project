The ground beneath my feet is part of me
The air and waterfall I'm part of it all

Do you listen to me?
We're part of the cycle of life
With respect for a planet so fragile
We'll help it survive

Can you hear the thunder?
The forces of nature
Are counting on you so don't disturb them
Have you seen it's wonders?
The forces of nature
Everything that you do will return to you

The crowds and motor ways expanding each day
She adjusts, but not for long feel the heat of the sun

Do you listen to me?
We're part of the cycle of life
With respect for a planet so fragile
We'll help it survive

Can you hear the thunder?
The forces of nature
Are counting on you so don't disturb them
Have you seen it's wonders?
The forces of nature
Everything that you do will return to you

Do you listen to me?
We're part of the cycle of life

Have you seen it's wonders?
