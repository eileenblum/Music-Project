You told me time and time again
I could not reach the end
So why even try!
But I did not listen very well
Threw wishes down the well
And upon distant stars

So what do you think of me now?
Now it is your calls I won't return
Lost forever

Lost Horizon
Land of eternal peace
Paradise on earth
I found my lost horizon

Agarthan race of super men
My tanka gold and red
In a trip outer body
Mahatma guide me to this place
Mind voyage in dream state â I've found Shambala

So what will you say to me now?
Now it is your cries I will not hear
Lost forever

Lost Horizon
Land of eternal peace
Paradise on earth
I found my lost horizon

Lost horizon, Lost horizon
I found my, I found my
Lost Horizon

So what do you think of me now?
Now it is your calls I won't return
Lost forever
