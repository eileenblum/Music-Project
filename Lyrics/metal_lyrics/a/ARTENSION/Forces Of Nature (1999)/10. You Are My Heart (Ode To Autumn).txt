Geese on the wing, Gold Autumn leaves
I've fallen for you, Season of change
Dear to me

Sunlight in my eyes, reminds me you are my heart
Forever yours

November winds. Winter begins
Falling so deep, season of sleep
You are so dear to me

Sunlight in my eyes, reminds me you are my heart
Forever yours
