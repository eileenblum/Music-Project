Now I can see,what it means, to finally be free
And now I can't wait, to live, forever
Cast your mind to a place where darkness is light
You'll find traces of me, left behind
Far behind, so far behind me

No don't let the tall ships sail away
It's part of you
Don't send emotion out to sea
Your mast and my sail
Won't save me
Don't let tall ships sail away

You know that together we can finally find
A place (no one can steal) where we will
Leave the world behind, so far behind us

No don't let tall ships sail away
It's part of you
Don't send emotion out to sea
Your mast and my sail
Won't save me
Don't let tall ships sail away

What can I do to tell you what it all means to me
No! Don't let Tall Ships sail away....

No don't let tall ships sail away
It's part of you
Don't send emotion out to sea
Your mast and my sail
Won't save me
Don't let tall ships sail away
