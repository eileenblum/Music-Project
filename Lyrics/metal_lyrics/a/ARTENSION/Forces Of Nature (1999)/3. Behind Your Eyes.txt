So you think you know frustration
And the hands of time are reaching for you
Final situation
Tell me what are you gonna do

To save yourself no place on earth to run
You can't run away you can't hide it from me
Desire burns

Behind your eyes river of love
In tears that you cry, why does your heart call out to mine?
Behind your eyes mirror of blue
Reflecting the lies, when did your love grow?
Behind your eyes

Desperate situation
Tell me what are you gonna do

To save your soul no place that you have to run
You can't hide away, you can't run from me
Desire burns

Behind your eyes river of love
In tears that you cry, why does your heart call out to mine?
Behind your eyes mirror of blue
Reflecting the lies, when did your love grow?
Behind your eyes

Behind your eyes river of love
In tears that you cry, why does your heart call out to mine?
Behind your eyes mirror of blue
Reflecting the lies, when did your love grow?
Behind your eyes
