Accelerate you're too late
Look around I'm right beside you
Primal kick, twist the wick
This cycles built for two

Ridin' no cares in the world to think of
The only thing we have to do is to
Ride like the wind

Not too fast make it last
Seeing all the sights around us
Hear the roar
There's nothing more
That excites you like the sound of my pan

Ridin' no cares in the world to think of
The only thing we have to do is to
Ride like the wind

Accelerate you're too late
Look around I'm right beside you
Primal kick, twist the wick
This cycles built for two

Ridin' no cares in the world to think of
The only thing we have to do is to
Ride like the wind

Ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
