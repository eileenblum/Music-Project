All the roads lead into the light
Blinding my eyes with shades of white

But it doesn't matter to me
So far away
And I never thought it could be
Ending this way

Evolution in reverse, it's not in my mind
Evolution in reverse, I told you, it's not in my mind

Forbidden secrets out of range
Now in regression, men must change

Evolution in reverse, it's not in my mind
Evolution in reverse

Turn of the century drawing near
Making two thousand man â made years

Evolution in reverse, it's not in my mind
Evolution in reverse
