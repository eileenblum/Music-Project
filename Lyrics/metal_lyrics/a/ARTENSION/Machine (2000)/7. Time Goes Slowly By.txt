Behold this relic, prelude to a vision of the past
With arms wide open, a tear in my eye
These visions now I find

There's so much here to see
It's all starting to make sense to me, there's so much left to do

But... Time goes slowly by
Yes.... Time goes slowly by

Time goes slowly by
Time goes slowly by you
Time goes slowly by

Within this circle, behold all the pieces of my life
With eyes wide open, discover me
My visions you will find

There's so much here to see
It's all starting to make sense to me, there's so much left to do

But... Time goes slowly by
Yes.... Time goes slowly by

Behold this relic, prelude to a vision of the past
With arms wide open, My visions you will find

There's so much here to see
It's all starting to make sense to me, there's so much left to do Chorus:

But... Time goes slowly by
Yes.... Time goes slowly by

Time goes slowly by
Time goes slowly by you
Time goes slowly by

Time goes slowly by
Time goes slowly by you
Time goes slowly by
