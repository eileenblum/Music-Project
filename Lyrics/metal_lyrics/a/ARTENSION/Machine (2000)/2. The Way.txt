Deep in this heart of mine, hidden away
New age dawning and questions turning into fears

Overtaught but never learning, upside down our world is turning
Over my head

Give me the answer, show me the way
Give me the answer, show me the way

Far from the city lights, I've felt the rain
And with each moment, thoughts unbroken in my mind

Overtaught but never learning, upside down our world is turning
Over my again

Give me the answer, show me the way
Give me the answer, show me the way

Deep in this heart of mine, hidden away
New age dawning and questions turning into fears

Overtaught but never learning, upside down our world is turning
Over my head

Give me the answer, show me the way
Give me the answer, show me the way
