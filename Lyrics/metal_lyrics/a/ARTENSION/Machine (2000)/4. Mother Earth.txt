How well do you know me?
For soon you will find
Just like my brother tree, Mother's blood flows through me
And I will look to the sun

We welcome the rain, as were born again
Her majestic beauty, somehow sacred to me
And I know she'll never die

She will survive, she will survive

Mother Earth
Tell me when will they see what you're worth?
You're my Mother Earth
Tell me when will they see what you're worth?
My Mother Earth

And just like my Brother dust
Blood of life's within us
And we will, will never die

We will survive, we will survive

Mother Earth
When will they see what you're worth?
You're my Mother Earth
When will they see what you're worth?
My Mother Earth

Mother Earth
When will they see what you're worth?
You're my Mother Earth
When will they see what you're worth?
My Mother Earth
