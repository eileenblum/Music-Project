Trying so hard to get in
Doing your best to belong
Promise all you ever wanted
But you can't afford the lost

Be a member, do or die
Join the club, but I see through your disguise

Hoping at last I'll find you
Wondering what's deep inside
Never show your inner beauty
Or the soul behind your eyes

Be a member, do or die
Join the club, but I see through your disguise

All that you love is money
You'll find it takes more to survive
You can't buy what's most important
Has the child within you died?

Be a member, do or die
Join the club, but I see through your disguise

I see through your disguise
