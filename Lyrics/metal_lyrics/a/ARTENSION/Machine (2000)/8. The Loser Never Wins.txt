It doesn't really matter to me
Who you know or who you're supposed to be
You all look the same, remember my name

You're beginning, the start of the game
And it's over, you can't win

And now you're finding out the loser never wins
You know the loser never wins

You always had this dream in your mind
But now you notice, dreams can quickly unwind
In a matter of time, you might lose your mind

You're common not one of a kind
And it's over, you can't win

And now you're finding out the loser never wins
You know the loser never wins

It doesn't really matter to me
Who you know or who you're supposed to be
You all look the same, remember my name

You're beginning, the start of the game
And it's over, you can't win

And now you're finding out the loser never wins
You know the loser never wins
