It's only a matter of time, 'til darkness is all I will find
The last thing left to lose is mind

Candles burning, trying to blind my eyes

Madness calling I'm falling to my knees
As hands withdrawing, fade slowly out of reach

It's always a matter of trust, 'til monuments crumble to dust
The only thing I can save is some time

Faces changing
Right before my eyes

Madness calling I'm falling to my knees
As hands withdrawing, fade slowly out of reach

It's certain a matter of fact, that knives will be stabbed in my back
The one thing I can do is react

Fuse is burning, burning in my mind

Madness calling I'm falling to my knees
As hands withdrawing, fade slowly out of reach
