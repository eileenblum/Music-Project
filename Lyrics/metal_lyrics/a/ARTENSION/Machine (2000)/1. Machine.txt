Another day is dawning and calling to me
And right before my eyes I clearly see
Can you hear my prayer? floating on the air

I've got you in my sights ooh yeah
I'm much too young to die

Machine trained for killing
Machine can't force the willing

Been far away for so long but I'm not lonely
My dreams are in the smoke that's in the air
Can you hear my plea? are you looking down on me?

I've got you in my sights ooh yeah
I'm not afraid to die

Machine trained for killing
Machine can't force the willing

Can you hear my prayer? floating on the air
I've got you in my sights ooh yeah
I'm much too young to die

Machine trained for killing
Machine can't force the willing
