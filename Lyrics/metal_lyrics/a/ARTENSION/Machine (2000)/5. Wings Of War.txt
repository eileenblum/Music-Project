Warrior spirits on the wind
Wait for the battle to begin
End is near but never over

I have seen it with my own eyes
I could show you the other side
On thunder horses they ride

Spirits soar on wings of war
Spirits soar on wings of war
On wings of war

Down through the ages, for all time
Now in the distance, bells do chime
Truth is here, but never ending

I have seen it with my own eyes
I could show you the other side
On thunder horses they ride

Spirits soar on wings of war
Spirits soar on wings of war
On wings of war
