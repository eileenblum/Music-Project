[West,Kuprij]

All That You Know And All That You Can Remember
Came From A Story Book Bound In Glory
Guarded By Steel
Alone, You Search For The Answer, A Candlelit Dancer
On Library Walls, Down Secretive Halls
Your Quest For The Truth
Truth You Search For The Answer

Tree Of Knowledge, Do You Feel The Pain?
Tree Of Knowledge, Kneeling In The Rain

What Have You Learned?
Your Bridge Has Been Burned
Alone, Cold And Naked, Innocence Taken
Lost Paradise

I Know You Know Me Too, I Know We Are Mistaken
Tree Of Knowledge, Always Tempting Fate
I Know You, You Know Me Too, I Know We Are Mistaken

Tree Of Knowledge, Do You Feel The Pain?
Tree Of Knowledge, Kneeling In The Rain
