[West,Kuprij]

You, You Took My Breath Away
A New Order - So Warm And Safe
I Know That Change Can Be Lonely
And Time Goes Slowly By

Pain, Oh Lord Pain It's Growing

Into The Fire
Down To The Wire
Pain And Desire
Future World
Dark Promises Everything
And Light Shines On The Lies And Pain
I Know That Change can Be Costly
And Time You Cannot Buy

Pain, Oh Lord Pain It's Growing

Into The Fire
Down To The Wire
Pain And Desire
Future World
