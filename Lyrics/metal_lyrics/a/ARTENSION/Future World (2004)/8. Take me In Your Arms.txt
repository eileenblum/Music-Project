[West,Kupri]

All that I Planned And All That I Dreamed
Facing The End, When Everything Seemed
Lost And Gone Away
Crossed Sacred Pathways
And Still I Need You so Bad

I Would Lay It Down, Let It Down
I Would Lay Down My Life

Take Me As Your Servant
Keep Me Safe From  Harm
I'll be Faithful
If You Just
Take Me In Your Arms

Somwhere In Space There Is A Place
Where Everything's Real, Emotions To Feel

I Would Lay It Down, Let It Down
I Would Lay Down My Life

Take Me As Your Servant
Keep Me Safe From  Harm
I'll be Faithful
If You Just
Take Me In Your Arms
