Caught out in the pourin' rain deep within my soul
live a life of torture and pain will it ever end? Will it ever end

Cold dark world seek my fortune what is right for you and me?
All these years turn and run away from what was meant to be

Take me far away, across the Seven Seas
we'll sail to yesterday, our burning hearts set free

Goin' Home, we've made some choices in our life time to make it right
goin' home so many choices in our life time to make it right

You said to me make this love last forever and a day
until you die in my arms nothing could ever separate

Take me far away, across the Seven Seas
we'll sail to yesterday, our burning hearts set free

Goin' Home, we've made some choices in our life time to make it right
goin' home so many choices in our life time to make it right

Divin' through the night through the stormy weather
make it last forever and a day

Goin' Home, we've made some choices in our life time to make it right
goin' home so many choices in our life time to make it right
