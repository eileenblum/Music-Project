When you hear voices callin' to you
In (he dark you don't know what to do
All alone as you wait for the light
Of the morning your fears you must fight

Are you imprisoned in your mind

Song of the desert whispers your name

With the sunrise you look all around
You strain to listen but canât hear a sound
So confusing but deep down inside
You know from those voices you canât run and hide

Were you just dreaming in the night

Song of the desert calls out your name

Wonât you listen
Wonât you listen

Theyâve something to say - you canât run away
They've something to say

Your shadow grows in the new setting sun
Another night of this madness begun
You canât believe your so far from home
So far from the things that youâve known
Why are the answers so hard to find
