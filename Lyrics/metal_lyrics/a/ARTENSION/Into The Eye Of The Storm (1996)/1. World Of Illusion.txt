So many secrets trapped in time
Forever silent eternal crime
Why? Did they die?

So many schemes
So many lies
So many dreams, buried alive

We want the truth â world illusion
Tell only lies â world of illusion
I've seen his face â so much confusion
It's our disgrace â world of illusion

We felt the presence â long ago

They've walked through the shadows of our souls

Why? Didn't we try?

So many plans
So little time
So many scams
Control our lives
