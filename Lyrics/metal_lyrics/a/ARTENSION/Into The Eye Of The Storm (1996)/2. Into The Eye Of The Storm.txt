Set a course for disaster weâre loaded out to sea
Through the thunder and lightning just you and me

Weâre gonna race the wind
Weâve got to keep runnin'
From mother nature hand
Storm clouds corninâ

It feels like weâre sailinâ
Into the eye of the storm
Feel the power of the wind
Into the eye of the storm

A wall of rain surrounds me I do not dare to fight
Whirlwind to the sky-natureâs power and might

Weâre gonna race the wind
Weâve got to keep runninâ

From mother nature hand
I feel my fate corninâ

Lift me up to the sky into the eye of the storm
I meet my fate in a white blaze of light
In the eye of the storm

Weâre gonna race the wind
Weâve got to keep runninâ

From mother nature hand
I feel my fate corninâ
