Remember how it used to be
When you were young and you were free
But that was many years ago
Now youâre not so young, you know
Itâs just a lost memory

Think of what your father said
Learned it in a book he said
How did all these years go by
Never ever knowing why
What it all really means

You will go through some change in your life
This change has happened to me
No matter how hard you hold on and try
Itâs a lost memory

Donât care how many tears you cry
Or how many lies you lie
Itâs coming soon or late for you
Nothing you can say or do
I tried everything too

Donât care how many tears you cry
Or how many lies you lie
How did all these years go by
Never ever knowing why
What it all really means
