With walls around me itâs getting hard to breath
Feels like theyâre closing in on me
So many miles Iâve travelled all around this earth
Or am I just walking in my sleep

Iâve got to get away
I've got to somehow, someway
Oh this city's haunting me

I hear the wind and the rain, they want ease my
pain
Save me from myself
Oh the wind and the rain tells me I'm insane
If I don't step back from the ledge
The wind and the rain

Far from the madness, the noise and the lights
I think Iâve had my fill of these
Sun does not shine on my face
Men like rats in a race
Will it just bring me to my knees

Iâve got to get away
Iâve got to somehow, someway
Oh this city's haunting me
