In my dreams â far from reality
I see a vision in my mind
In a world of uncertainty the future is mine to see
A message of hope for all mankind

And now that you know it's in your control
Tell me what you're gonna do
It's all up to you
You hold the key

Four hundred years ago my people used to know
How man and earth were as one
But time clouds the truth, you see â destroy our own history
Still hold the key it's not too late

And now that you know it's in your control
Won't you tell me what you're gonna do
It's all up to you
You hold the key

Hear the voices failin' will the walls soon be failin'
I see a vision in my mind, a message of hope for all mankind

In my dreams â far from reality
I see man and earth as one
In a world of uncertainty the future, is mine to see
Still you hold the key, it's not too late
Now that you know it's in your control you hold the key to your destiny
