Round, round, round it goes
Where it stops no one knows
Iâm playing a game, with my life
Took a chance on my final roll
Just donât ever want to lose control
Takinâ a ride with my heart

I know the odds are stacked against me
Itâs all or nothing, set me free

Iâm gonna let it ride
Lady luck stand by my side
Iâm gonna let it ride

Round and round the story goes
Canât remember feelinâ so alone
Iâm placing my bet on your life
Wheel of fortune spinninâ round
Donât think itâs ever gonna slow me down
I drew a queen and sheâs wild

I know the odds are stacked against me
Itâs all or nothing, set me free

Iâm gonna let it ride
Lady luck stand by my side
