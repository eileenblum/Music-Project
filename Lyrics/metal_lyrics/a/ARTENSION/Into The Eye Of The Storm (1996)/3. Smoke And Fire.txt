Smoke signals burnin' deep inside of me
Burnin' white hot for all the world to see
You know the power of love got a hold on heart and mind
And all the other flames gotta leave 'em all behind
Yeah leave 'em all behind come on and rescue me

Smoke and fire that's what you are smoke and fire

I never knew a man could act the way I do
Just short of arson, aw, I do it all for you
You know the spark of love lights the fuse of soul and mind
And all the other flames gotta leave 'em all behind
Oh leave 'em all behind

Smoke signals burnin' deep inside of me
Burnin' white hot for all the world to see
You know the power of love got a hold on heart and mind
And all the other flames gotta leave 'em all behind
Yeah leave 'em all behind
