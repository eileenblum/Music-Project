dark... into
dawn... into
day... after
day
evermore beckon discarnate disenchant unto dust
coalesce to form as sphere and strata anneal
calming storms still incessant void looms on
vibrant stream without origin issues forth
ever unfolding myriad's thought and form without end
veiled essence perennial woe seeding obverse impermanence
unseen the watcher lying in wait a weathered stone alone
temples raised to exalt divine
temples raised on the shifting sands of time
shadows cast then fade away only to repeat again this way
and how the days they drift and fade away
as thought and form succumb to age
for mortal repine or epicidean eterne?  one single tear lost
I am hunger desire incarnate flesh and bone alone
