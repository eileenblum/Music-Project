In the morning formless twilight
Theophanny masked
In natures breath
Glint of dawn
A lambent flame
Penumbrae lifts her veil
In return traces
The sleeping majesty
Vibrant sunsplash
Awakens terrain
Bathers in the glory, pangean fate
Shadow clings to stones that cast
Darkened recession
Succumbs to dawn
Phoenix arise

At the mercy
Of the skies caprice
For the life of me
Suspend my disbelief

Morning star
Bask tha hardened clay
Chase the fog away
Raise the climbing meridian

Sunlight burn away
Daylight burn away
Sol Invictus radiate
Red stars fiery oceans
Crown the escalade
Sunrise lift this burden
Daylight burn away
This frozen moment
Lost in haze

Flames in the forhead
Of the morning sky
Awaken the rebirth
The invincible sun
Bloodless covenant
In tongues of fire
Thunderbirds ascension
A clarion call
