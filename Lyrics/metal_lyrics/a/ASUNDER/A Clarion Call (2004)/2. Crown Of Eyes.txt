In this sacred grave
Where gods die
An eventide kingdom
Brightly shines

Constellations solemn throne
Interstellar celestial dome
The universe within its branches
A vestige born n blood
Tree fallen to shadow
Roots our mortal thread
In dream or death
The origin of echoes spirals out

Sea of stars
Glimmering moon
Shimmering black
A mirror pool
Depths to darkness
Days journey
Into dream
Earthbound surrender
The golden city sleeps
Vespertine

O wanderers
Enter the labyrinth
Ike moth to flame
The silver garden weeps
Weeps its nectar
Leaves and petals close
Dawn awaits the dew
In servitude
To sun and rain
A mockery of faith
From across the darkness
Wave upon waveform
Overlap and combine
Inter written
Through space and time
