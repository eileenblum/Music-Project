A process of learning
Taking time
The ever changing nature of life

We belong to events in our world
Impermanent never still
Unfolding ones own

Our home

Karmic choice, constantly

All things under influence
Subject to change
Nothing to remain the same

Action is phrased movement is made
To be of a substance
Reliving day thought uniting

We belong to events in our world
Permanent never still
Turning it over in time

Karmic voice, listening
