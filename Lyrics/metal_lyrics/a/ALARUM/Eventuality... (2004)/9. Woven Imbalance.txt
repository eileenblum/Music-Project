Expanding life a movement of a stream

The midst of delusion
Found and swept away
Unweaving a time of manipulation
A thousand years blinded
Hidden treasures of existence

Free energy
Uncovered truth
In essence for all

Mother of invention
Forever shine on
Tranquil ming
Gateway of infinity

By unwielding and unveiling

Pure insight, structure of yourself
Long ago by instinct or reason
Inegrity the heart of the universe

In essence for all

By unwielding and unveiling
