The flicker of light
Attached to a human body
Bringing lives that fell by the wayside

Organize, harmonize
As a whole existence
A flowing stream
A clear vision to see
Nearing our true state of higher consciousness

Conforming, serving
Impossible track forming outside
The cure situated within
Heal our world

A day will shine
Right behind your eyes
10, 000 thoughts arise

In a sustained connection

Sustained connection precognition
As clear as a painted picture in mind
Recurring vision seeks the light
Outward impression reaches inside

Conforming, serving
Impossible track forming outside
The cure situated within

In a sustained connection

An open heart and mind
Given the sacred plane
In a world of continuity
