Awakening to a world to be real
Unbroken promises of our world
The pain removed awareness

Your voice crystal clear
Sounding all i hear

Moment to moment
Throughout the years

Flow throughout this world
Always incoming
Fueled by the dreams that grow and grow

Broken waves part to make the room to be
Winds fall breathe more

No longer prisoner
Of thoughts or your unresolved past

Look back at your world and know
whats coming
Discover whats inside don't deny it
Flow throughout our world
Always incoming
Filled by the presence of you
