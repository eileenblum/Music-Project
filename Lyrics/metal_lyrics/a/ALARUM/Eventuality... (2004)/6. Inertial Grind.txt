Ever looking knowing why
Of a wider world
Natural wealth beyong yourself
Awaits inside to find

A temple of the sky
I break these chains
Now I...

Fly
Breath takes me far away
From the daily grind

Now I feel time is calling
Motionaless and free
An ocean of illusion
Waits inside of me

A temple of the sky
I break these chains
Now I...

Fly
Breath takes me far away
From inertial tides

Inertial grind

See, upon your mind as like a tree
Far from ground
Deny, ways of life
Simplicity will resolve

Inertial grind

Breathe, for your time has come to see
Past undone
Survive, as intended by the light
Of the sun
