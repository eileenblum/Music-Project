On Demand life takes a lead
At a speed of thought discovery
Transcending wonder how can it be
Remain in balance integrally

Step through the gate...receiver

There see the sight of wonder light
Enriched in natures gift of life

Sun shines on through our blue shrine
Needing to accomplish a race with time

And then...
Step into the wondrous temple
Where flesh turns to light

Be alarmed at what they'll push on you
your choice to absorb or say no
An avenue for mind control
