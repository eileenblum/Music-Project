Situated between a process
Of our worlds expression
Development
Existence like a black hole

Birth from another
Dependent on each other

Reconditioned
Becoming...

Less of the world
More of the earth

Growth soon to follow
Essence merged with consciousness
The path of the unique
Birth is another
Seed of transformation
Reconditioned
Becoming...alive

Bring the others
As a journey takes its place
Reconditioned
Becoming...

Less of the world
More of the earth

And again to recontinue...
