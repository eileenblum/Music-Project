Suspended animation, displaced in time
Synchronic isolation -a maker's design
Forever cascading into the unknown
Remaining eclipsed, my conclusional rift
Learning there can be a shadow of doubt
History resides in an illusion
Paintings of those endured
Cocerning insanity
Dimensional view achieved through you

[solos - Evans, Young]

Severed
Vernacular frame woven away
Disrupting the line
Endurance of living alternate lives

[solo - Evans]

An instant that is an instant that's gone
Controlling to find
A force once sacred turns to separate lives
Severed
