Eyes open, past regret
Present timing, decide
Between myselves, enclosed
You see, but not show like me
Or know what to hide
Within my walls I will accept
my waterfalls, understand
Washing me over like the ocean's tide
Walking through the gardens of our Earth
That place we visit in our minds
Inside this realm of imagination
Time split, coke is it
My anger ten times taller than your head
Rush to find pain here when you interfere
I knew that you could only be true
Manipulated by who?
Influence is obvious
Window of the soul
Where contact is made
We don't know or see
Until we realize

[solo - Evans]

The pilot of a mystery, surviving
The shoreline a sheath for crashing waves
Instinctive they will grasp
As they try to breathe
And become empty shells again
Washing me over like the ocean's tide
Walking through the gardens of our Earth
That place we visit in our minds
Inside this realm of imagination
Window of the soul
Where contact is made
We don't know or see
Until we realize

[solo - Young]

Reach in to find out in spirit, in being
A matter of love, a matter of change
The glass of the maker fastened by sand...
