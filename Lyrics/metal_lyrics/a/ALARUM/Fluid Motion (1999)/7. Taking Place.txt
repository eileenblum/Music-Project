The wrong man is blind
The right man may see
That the thoughts you choose
Create your opportunity
See the favour you owe your life
Too late to hide, roll the dice
Space, time, evolution
Taking place
A step in evolution
A process far and wide
Filling all of time and space
Wherever rays can shine
The time has come to look
Through the mirror
Realize what's been done
And where we should be
It's you who can change
Over the vast ranges taking shape
Space, time, evolution
It's you who can change
Over the vast ranges taking shape
It's you who can change
Can't you see what's taking place?
