Blueprint: the skin from a homeworld
Driven by anxious bite
Amounting the fury that had us as children
Ablaze in scarlet wonder
The happenings of void
To which our kind has not plagued
So the ultimate in founders will lead
Searching the next boundary
Seeking inner/outer growth
The obscuring haze
Another place an equal home
For the merged to say
Enveloped in rage
The seeking mind
The fuel of our flight is quest

[solo - Evans]

What is lost is replaced by more mystery

Blueprint

[solo - Young]

The happenings of void
To which our kind has not plagued
So the ultimate in founders will lead
Searching the next dream
And what will it bring
Our machines are puzzles of movement solved
The unifying can bring travel
To effortless actions
It yearns to seek
