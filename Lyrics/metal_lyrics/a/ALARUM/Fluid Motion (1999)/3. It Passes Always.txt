Nature allows nothing but herself
It's why we're placed between her motions
To build and thrive like material gods
The stubborn fixtures that she always removes
see to believe, so many to breathe
Pleasing selves create to occupy
One look would be a step inside me
I am a constant in the ever's change
As I dream I see when other's seem
It passes always
Underneath the outermost skies
The one who seeks, the one who finds
It passes always

[solo - Evans]

One look would be a step inside me
I am a constant in the ever's change
As I dream I see when other's seem
It passes always
Tidal, the wave that gives memory
Underneath the outermost skies
Spoken thoughts that circle me
The one who seeks, the one who finds
It passes always

[solo - Young]

Out from below down through
Our rings of smoke
A concrete mass emerges as one
Its resedence points towards an end
As it passes always a change will carry on
