Looking to the future to watch it all evolve
Computing spectra minds exulting form
Alone sheltered living in fear
Confined to sadness, full of tears
In darkness a message is born
Releasing pain to become untorn
Silence changes in years of existence
Withering away in the wrath of shame
Divided people merge into rage
Witness the future made today
Surrounded by walls, nowhere to turn
Visions of hope as you feel your soul burn
A presence unknown, not within
Remain in silence searching for hope
Silence changes in years of existence
Withering away in the wrath of shame
Divided people merge into rage
Witness the future made today

[solos - Evans]

Returning from the future to watch it all evolve
Computing spectra minds exulting form
Silence changes in years of existence
Withering away in the wrath of shame
Divided people merge into rage
Witness the future fade away
