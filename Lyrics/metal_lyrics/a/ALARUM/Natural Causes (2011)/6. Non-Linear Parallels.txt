Exploring freedom I find
Truth shrouded in lies

Release myself through
The body conscious

Engraved glaring eyes
An odyssey of minds

Design of the ever
Encoded conscious dream

Thoughts of expansion

Design of the ever
Encoded conscious dream

Decision, laws of life
Precision, in form, insight

Design of the ever
Prevailing chi
Absorbing me

Branching out
Connect to our self

Design of the ever
Required for going to
Residing forever in
Non-linear parallels
