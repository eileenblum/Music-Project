Organised hypocrisy, a shameless flame
Buried deep in lies, a superficial stare

The fear they provide is how they fuel the fire
False security of religion
Control termed spiritual

Hidden beneath, emotional deceit
Betrayal in disguise

Given belief and false views of peace
Betrayal, brainwashed time

I want to break you
And all your lies
Expose you
For far too long
Your manipulation has ruled
We must remove you
