Vision, a symbol
A sign to behold
Worlds of dormant potential
The future we hold
Beyond their face of matter
A need to feed and grow
Past, present and future... we hold

Eyes wide open to be
Minds unfrozen to see

Strive to view all you can in life

Life is born from light within
The exterior view before
The voice in one signal's call
Life is born from light within
The exterior view in store
The voice in one signal's call

Eyes wide open to be
Minds unfrozen to see

Beyond warning
Signs on every level
Worlds are misrepresented
The future we hold
A choice the fact of matter
A seed to reap and sow
Past present and future...we hold

Strive to view all you can in life

Life takes form to light within
The exterior view before
The voice in one signal's call
Life takes form to light within
The exterior view before
The void
