Sleeping on embrace of tomorrow
Create what I want to see
I'll awake in the morning
To believe another day

Mind...once was, now will be
Dreamt off...

I rise above the intervention
A land beyond inhibition
Body numb to the sensation
My soul erupts
Bound to this psychosis
For new creation

Restfulness shall tame the awakened
A scene that's forever been
I'll reveal what is taken
To believe another day

Mind...once was, now will be
Dreamt off...

I rise above the intervention
A land beyond inhibition
Body numb to the sensation
My soul erupts
Bound to this psychosis
For new creation

Dreamt off...

I rise above the intervention
A land beyond inhibition
Body numb to the sensation
My soul erupts
Bound to this psychosis
For new creation
