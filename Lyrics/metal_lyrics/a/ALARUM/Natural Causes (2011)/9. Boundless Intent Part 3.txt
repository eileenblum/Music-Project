Looking before no difference known
What I thought deep inside has more to find
Purpose and sense, the lesson of learning
Each day and night, the measure turning

In Search Of...

Flowing treasure, what do I see?
The learning Unison to complete
Walk along an edge in a world of demand
Under watchful eyes, the sense, and spirit of eternity

...Intent
Boundless
