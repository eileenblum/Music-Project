Reflection, pressure to sustain
To reach a level
A higher plain

Time is now
Interspace - devisal
Exuviate the world

The inner trials
An inborn guide
An interface between you and all
Interface

The need is without an end
The end is without a need

Perception, a measure to attain
To reach a level
A higher plain

Time is now
Interspace - devisal
Exuviate the world

The inner trials
An inborn guide
An interface to adapt to change
We inteface
World
Self
All
