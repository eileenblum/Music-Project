Feral, twisting illusion
Surrounding everywhere, where're it goes
Oh...

Oh you wonderful desire
Shedding your skin you're always reborn again

Millions bow their heads 'n pray
Falling before your mystifying gaze
They see the blessing in your eyes
Salvation n' your second- sight!

Don't believe the lies
About its awesome eyes
You're being enticed
Trust me it's nothing but hype
