I'm restless every night,
my heart's on fire
My life's on the line and I know why...
While I'm just a number in a file
I'll not rest in peace till let me die

Everywhere I look a spy -
Watch out or you'll soon be surprised...
I dread that I'm alive...
Waiting 'til the force arrives -
It's coming in disguise
When it indignifies...

I wanna go where things don't torment my mind
I jump up when I hear a noise at night
Yes, my - even my friends
may take a side
Silence kills - n' makes me
think of suicide...

Like clouds above the waves
The wind above the lake
Like liberated prey
I'll disappear and fly away

Fly away - like clouds
above the waves.
