No light do my eyes see - Greyness locks me in my room
Surrounding me like a ghost of doom
No sound for my ears to hear - Daddy abruptly yells at me
Mud in my brain -and water in my ear

No body here with me...

No one I could call near - Maybe an image within my mind
Mommy just waits n' hopes I'm fine
Shadows, such a cold dream - And as the blood beats in my ear
I wish I could leave my body here

Now there's no remedy
No flaw in this theory
No flaw, but destiny
Will kill you, you'll see
You sent me through permanently
There'll be no more agony...
NO!!!

Lying here dying is a jerk, who only lived for his work
He didn't spare anyone, or anything
The power he created turned against him and took everything...
...Foolish pallid shadow
Like a strange toy on a shelf which fate built
...And could there possibly be no explanation,
Just humiliation, or degradation...?!
