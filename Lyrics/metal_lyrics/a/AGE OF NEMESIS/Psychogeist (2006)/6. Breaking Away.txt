[MOMMY:]
Listen to me, heed my plea
Forget 'bout your bloody dream
There's no one else left for me
N' no one else you can believe

If you lock the door now - the light will find you here
If you leave this path now - you'll come on home to me

Listen now to your mother
Let's defeat death together!

If you lock the door now - the light will find you here
If you leave this path now - you'll come on home to me
Go and lock the door now - n' the light will find you here
Go and leave this path now - n' you'll come on home to me

...Everything begins to shudder,
icy horror devastates with doom
Objects exploding everywhere,
and the wind howls through the room...

[BOY:]
I think I can hear you, but I can't see you Mother
Revenge has made me completely blind
But in my heart I feel a strange and warmish light
Maybe you could be my sight!

[MOMMY:]
Fly away...
Fly away - like clouds above the waves!

******

Maybe we should regard - the rhythm of the past
December's door's a lark - forget it, there's no path
It's locked and bolted fast - a mem'ry of the past
No longer is it harsh - It's nothing but a laugh!

Now the door is bolted fast -

FOREVER!!
FOREVER!!
FOREVER!!
