It's gone by - yesterday passed in the night
Don't you cry - the horror's gone n' taken flight

I draw you near me, shielded by the light
Like when I carried you for months beneath my heart
I feel you touch me, but I haven't got a clue
Just how to help you
Oh, if I could only help you...

Come here, help me
Touch me or speak to me
There's no one left for me...!!!

Your body's just a grave, but where has your soul gone?
You're in another world...
Embrace me, hold me near
No, your silence can't take you away from me
See? Mommy's crying... If you hear me at all...

Come here, help me
Touch me or speak to me
There's no one left for me now...!

Forget the theory that rewrote your destiny
Summer's upon us, but your soul can't see
Come here and help me please, listen your mamma's plea
Open up, look at me, or you'll never be free!

You must live your life now - live your life!
