Crumbling from within
The city lives in sin
Seeking their demise
Thousands take their lives

They expected more
Or couldn't heed the score
Now they're after blood:
The 'death-dealing' prophet

Yesterday everyone adored him
Today they thoroughly deplore him

Only one option now remains
Once again, someone must take the blame
Dreaded fear, blind faith, selfishness
Now you see: man's not ready yet

Blood just flows and grows
Deadly bogus hope
Deeds breed nil aside
Just newer sins n' crimes

And somewhere he awaits his dark fate
Knowing they'll surely find him one day

Dreaded fear, blind faith, selfishness
Now you see: man's not ready yet
Once again, someone must take the blame
Only one option now remains:
A victim for the new redemption set
Even though we're not worthy of it yet
