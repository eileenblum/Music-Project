Beyond sparkling lakes my boat keeps on sailing
The rope softens, my hands keep on freezing
I gaze towards the horizon,
Towards the land you promised me

I have no fears even if I feel everything is falling 
for everything that falls is falling with me

Your voice calling me back
I still can hear it like a dead shriek
Could I have wanted more?
Haven't I always dreamt of this?
Oblivion
Each breath is now taking me further
Oblivion
Night's air has become a blanket
Oblivion
covering me more with each move
See, the moonlight has formed her one way path

...Look up the skies... Their realm has never seemed so calm
....never seemed so calm
I close my eyes... Now I can close my eyes...
