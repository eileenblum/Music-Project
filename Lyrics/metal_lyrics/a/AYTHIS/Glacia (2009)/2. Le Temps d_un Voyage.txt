Tell me about dreams you're seeing now
Tell me about calming the raging waves
Tell me how death has ceased hunting you down
Tell me about yesterdays

Time avoids you now...
Time avoids you now but the fire's burning still
Times avoids you now through the ages you're waiting
Tell me about the screams flowing the gardens
Tell me about the why's and today's
and when will you free me?

Tell me about the rising stones
about winter's great colds
When will I see you again
Glacial winds blow
as i carve your name in the dust
your sight beckons my fall
When will I see you again?
Can you hear the chaos' call

Tell me about dreams you're seeing now
Tell me about calming the raging waves
Tell me how death has ceased hunting you down
Tell me about yesterdays

Time avoids you now...
Time avoids you now but the fire's burning still
Times avoids you now through the ages you're waiting
Tell me about the screams flowing the gardens
Tell me about the why's and today's
and when will you free me?
