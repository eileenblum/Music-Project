Deep in the heart of a night
The time seems abandoned
Fragments of words in my head
Lead me to the promise you conceal

Forget me not
for when the morning comes
and severs the dark
I'll find myself more disconsolate

Enfolded by their laments pale and dull
A wounded past won't silence
The roaring of their screams
Your demise leaves me here
Forlorn, cold
Lost as a cry

In the immensity now laid waste
Some fragments of words in my head
Leading me to the promise you conceal
How did i end up so forlorn?
How did i end up so lost and cold?
Some fragments of words in my head
Leading me to vivid images
Now I fear the time
Now I fear its mysteries

Hollow-eyed I comprehend
That from others and from days
I'd better hide
Deep in the heart of a night
Forget me not
For when the morning comes
and severs the dark
I'll find myself more disconsolate
