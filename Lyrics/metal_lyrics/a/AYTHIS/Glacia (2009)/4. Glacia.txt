If I am like no other
Then turn me into ice
I will take shape of a hill
Glacia
You'll see the wounds of my past
In the valleys I'll head straight
Oh Glacia, I'll be a river of ice.

Glacia
I'll be a river of ice
Glacia
No veil to cover me
Glacia
No tears for me to cry
Glacia
If I am like no other
Then turn me into ice

I'll head straight to those places
Where they all found balance
I won't cease watching you
Through nights of winter
I will have left no trace
only a river of ice

Glacia
I'll be a river of ice
Glacia
No veil to cover me
Glacia
No tears for me to cry
Glacia
If I am like no other
Then turn me into ice
