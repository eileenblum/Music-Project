Scattered upon the earth
where smoke fills the air
misty faces come and go
but can't break the silence
in confinement under the violet sky

nothing is left but to wait
the end of things doesn't seem to exist

A myriad of words speak to my ears
The path is endless for the loner
to reach the land where you hear
mountains breathe

Scattered upon the earth
where tragedies fill the air
misty faces come and go
like your haunting strain
in confinement under the violet sky
