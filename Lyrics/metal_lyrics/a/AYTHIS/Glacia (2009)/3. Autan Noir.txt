My whole shivers as I feel
my fever entwined by the wind
The end of the road is near
black winds, enclosing the valleys
The white skies open and swallow their screams

I once dreamed you could reach me
in the ocean's waves
Now all i see is their silent dances
I once dreamed we could be together
in this dismal scenario

but noone ever walked these shores
In his mirages the loner hides his fears
Passively I watched the seasons pass
the meadows getting dried
like rusted over time,
like rusted over time.
