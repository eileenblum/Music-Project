Breaking in to places,
fighting every single feeling,
every single thought in my head,
I make it from the distance
thinking of the past times baby,
the last time that we met.

Can you all feel the tension
some like a distant burning desire,
to slit each other's throat,
I can barely recognize what we sometimes seems to carry.

When every time we seem to try so hard
was just a fancy way to show, 
that you were only unpredictable
well it suits the best in you.
we're embraced in cold and darkness
and a time of blinds and fakes
the bitter eyes will not stop haunting you
it will bring you down today

Fight, anger, lies
bleed, murder, rage
Fight, anger, lies
bleed, murder, rage

Not a single time you waste a breath that I mean nothing to you
where did you run to, where did you go, did I mean nothing to you
You're living a new life, your living is good,
we guess you be moron, your intention prelost
I thought I had you, when I thought I knew you

The thoughts of you and me as the perfect ones
the perfect ones to be, are slowly fading away
you can't smile with my thought and my control
Of course I'm trying and still, and I'm writing these songs, 
I'm writing these songs to you, but did you really stop and think
the thought of your voice has the impact to chance my life
I'm standing with 2 open veins and a razorblade, with the thought of a better life
I'm standing with 2 open veins and a razorblade, with the thought of a better time

Broken down, and broken dreams

No, she's not coming back
she's not coming back no more
those stains of love
god no, she's not coming back
she's not coming back no more
those stains of love
god no, she's not coming back
she's not coming back no more
those stains of love 
god no, she's not coming back
she's not coming back no more
those stains of love
