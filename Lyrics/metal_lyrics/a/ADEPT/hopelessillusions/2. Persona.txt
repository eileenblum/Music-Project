Go!

It's feels so sad, it feels so wrong to see that you are not who you used to be
When I just give, drifting further away towards the voice of the people
Shouldn't I meant, this time I think I let you know, let you know.
But you're only falling further down, onto the ground
Just like the others, report to duty

It's stands right here, this stubborn arrow has shown
you wouldn't stand and take the fight,
did it feel alright, it wasn't worth the time to kill,
the only thing that was pure at all

Bring all your intentions, put them in a box
throw away the key,
Shouldn't I meant, this time I think I let you know, let you know.
But you're only falling further down, onto the ground
Just like the others, report to duty

Shouldn't I meant, this time I think I let you know, let you know.
But you're only falling
Shouldn't I meant, this time I think I let you know, let you know.
But you're only falling further down, onto the ground
Just like the others, report to duty
You think to long, I'm moving on
You think to long, I'm moving on
