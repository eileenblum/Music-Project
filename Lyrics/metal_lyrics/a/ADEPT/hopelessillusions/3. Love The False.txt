Waiting, waiting for a sign
to bring us back again.
to the place where we began
when everything was pure

so this is my chance to show you
and the rest of the world,
how I feel about our time apart
I miss you, I miss you

and all the I love you's
where they really pure at all?
or just words to hide the truth
I love you, I love you

leaving leaving me and there's nothing else to do
then to stand and watch you go away

so this is my chance to show you
and the rest of the world,
how I feel about our time apart
I miss you, I miss you

and all the I love you's
where they really pure at all?
or just words to hide the truth
I love you, I love you

so I'm writing these letters,
putting my sorrow down on a paperslip
on a paperslip in fear.
it's not my intention to hurt you
its just a way to ease the pain
I'm sorry, so sorry.
the absence of you becomes numbing
and I'm ready to take this for
the absence of love becomes murder
and I'm already heading there

so this is my chance to show you
and the rest of the world,
how I feel about our time apart
I miss you, I miss you

and all the I love you's
where they really pure at all?
or just words to hide the truth
I love you, I love you

so this is my chance to show you
and the rest of the world,
how I feel about our time apart
I miss you, I miss you
