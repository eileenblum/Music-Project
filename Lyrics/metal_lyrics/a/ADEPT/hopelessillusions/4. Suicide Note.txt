I'm sitting on this edge
and the air seems colder now
as the thoughts in my head just go on and on and on
like what if I took a step into the clear sky
would then my absence make a tear fall from your eye?

I'm sitting on this edge
but whether or not, 
whether or not I fall
my life is falling away (away)

handwritten letter, I'm letting you know, letting you know
that blood drup fell from my eyelid
when you're joking me down joking me down
so dethrown now, stept down from your pedestone right now

I'm lost in this moment, but forever I'm free
when I'm buried again you so you can't see my tears

sincerely yours, always
were the last words that I wrote
so your crying now when everything is over
so dethrown now, stept down from you pedestore right now

I'm lost in this moment, but forever I'm free
when I'm buried again you so you can't see my tears
I'm lost in this moment, but forever I'm free
when I'm buried again you so you can't see my tears

I see the side, with a different light
knowing that everything is over
and it has been pondering in my head
all the words to me she said, she said

I see the side, with a different light
knowing that everything is over
and it has been pondering in my head
all the words to me she said, she said

But I guess this is how the story goes
But I guess this is how the story goes
But I guess this is how the story goes
