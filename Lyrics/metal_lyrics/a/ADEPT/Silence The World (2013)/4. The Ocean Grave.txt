I'm almost out of breath.

I know the ocean is calling my name
Under a moon that is changing its depths.
I know the tide will be here someday
To rise tall and to wash me away.

I built my life like a house in the sand.
By the items this world could provide.
I stood my ground to secure our dream.
Come wash me away.

Let's say it now.
Don't wait another year to weight us down.
'Cause we can't swim forever
When we're tied up
To the anchors f our past.
To love is to let go

But we swim towards the light that is burning for us.
And beneath all this surface of life
We both know what is waiting
For us in the depths of the sea.

We have created a monster.
That is anxiously waiting to feed
On the love that we built all these years.
There will be blood.

Let's say it now.
Don't wait another year to weight us down.
'Cause we can't swim forever
When we're tied up
To the anchors f our past.
To love is to let go

(Come wash away)
The sea of death has swallowed our love.
We are tied up to anchors of life and death.
