The ground beneath your feet will fucking cave in!
Stand up and flee
This is the consequence of being away
I spent so many years blaming myself
For when you ran away
And left me growing up alone
I was just a kid, and I was all alone
I never felt like I had a place to call home
Have you ever lost faith in yourself
For only a blink of an eye
We sing this song
For families who stand strong
When the weight of the world caves in
The strongest one will win
We sing this song
For every loving heart
Go back to home
I am
I am the shell of what you have become
How could you all hurt yourself like this
You have people around, caring about you deathly
I know the person that you really are
I've seen the love that you carry around
I miss your trustworthy words
Your eyes could move a mountain
Have you ever lost faith in yourself
For only a blink of an eye
We sing this song
For families who stand strong
When the weight of the world caves in
The strongest one will win
We sing this song
For every loving heart
And as seasons change,
When this time will drift away
I will remember you
My mind will stay the same
Wooo-oo-oh-oh
This is the sound of forgiveness
But I know you'll never hear this song alive
Wooo-oo-oh-oh
This is the sound of forgiveness
But I know you'll never hear this song alive
I will carry your absence with me
Until the day I die
