We're back motherfuckers
And this one's for the fucking crew.
So raise your fucking brew.
This one goes out to you, you and you.
You know how the fuck we do.

Here we go again.

With our friends right here
We can make it to the mountain top.
So let's raise our drinks up
And we'll party 'til the end of time.

We're gonna make it.
It really doesn't matter what you think about us anymore.
You're selling out; fuck you.
We're in this to win it alone or by your side.

We are the ones who never gonna back out.
The best of friends having the time of their fucking lives.

We're here to take back all control
Of things and leave all the shady shit that we had behind.
New hopes and all new dreams is what we waited for.

To all my friends,
This is a party that we couldn't had without all of you.
So let's smug this shit down.
Hey barkeep; all drinks on us.

We are the ones who never gonna back out.
The best of friends having the time of their fucking lives.

We are the ones who never gonna back out.
The best of friends having the time of their fucking lives.

So now you know what we're up to.
We welcome you to hear the songs about
The last year past
And all the ways that affected us
In a way or another. So we sing it loud.
It shapes the sound of our voices. The beat of
Our hearts
And the way that we talk. This is sincerety.
This is the way we breathe.

Until the day we fucking die; we live for this
We live for this!

We are the ones who never gonna back out.
Our eyes are set on the mountain top
And we will make it.
We are the ones who always gonna thank you
for the love you shown,
And the support that you been giving.

We are the ones who never gonna back out.
Our eyes are set on the mountain top
And we will make it.
We are the ones who always gonna thank you
for the love you shown,
And the support that you been giving.
