I see a thousand city lights
And I will surely see a thousand more
Brightening up the path we go
Still I never felt so fucking blind.

I feel like a man from the dead.
Every thing I touch turns into death.

You have a heart that belongs to me.
At least that is what you're trying to tell me.
But can you keep a secret, love?
I never really had a heart at all.

(I will) bury you alive.
And burn down the places you cherish most.
You fuck.

God damn I hope you burn inside
When I set your home on fire.
But being the rat that you surely are
I wouldn't be surprised if you get out.

I feel like a man from the dead.
Every thing i touch turns into dead.

You made me like this, betrayer.
You took away everything that I ever loved.
You made me like this, betrayer
I don't give a single fuck if
You're dead or alive.

You have a heart that belongs to me.
At least that is what you're trying to tell me.
But can you keep a secret, love?
I never really had a heart at all.

Bounce motherfucker!

The sound of your voice
Gets louder at night.
As I can't get it out of my head.
This isn't over.

You made me like this, betrayer.
You took away everything that I ever loved.
You made me like this, betrayer
I don't give a single fuck if
You're dead or alive.

Forever alone in this.
Your silence betrays the promises you made.
Forever in ache with you.
You took away my sight, my speech, my love.

I am so sorry to hear
That I hurt you so bad, dear.
But you were always away and you never
Made me feel at home.
How can you write all these things about me?
When we know there is more to this.
I'm so sorry to hear you keep
Writing these songs about me.
We were never supposed to be.
