Why do we need to have it all?
We are the carriers
Of the sickness in the world.

All hope is lost.
We are betraying our nature of living.
All hope is gone.
This is a time of changing.

Consuming the things that we don't need.
Evolving into our own greed.
The need to have it all
In life and in death.
But all that is left
Is a hole in the world.

Bring her back from the dead.

All hope is lost.
We are betraying our nature of living.
All hope is gone.
This is a time of changing.

The lights are dying
In our eyes and in the sky.
We are infected by the thought
That there will be a tomorrow.

The winter of death is freezing our lungs
And taking control of our beating hearts.
Nothing last forever: one day it'll be lost.
The sun maybe sets but it might not rise again.

Bring her back from the dead.

We have taken her limits.
She is dried up and weak.
Our mother earth is dying
And we will be sentenced to death.
We have taken her limits
And all that is left is a hole in the world.

(Let's go)
Set sail for tomorrow.
Another day for the weak and the hollow.
