It isn't easy when the world turns the back on you
I am the fire burning down this cigarette
Honestly I never really thought you'd make it this far

This was all on me, and I can't take it back

You made me feel like I could take your world away
But your words didn't mean a thing to me
In time I know I'll reach at the end of us again
Bring back my life
Retrace my steps
Full speed ahead, don't back this out

This was all on you, and you can't take it back

The secrets out and all I hear
Is the fire burning down our bridges
Still I carry you home through the fire and the flames
If you need me there you know I will be

Can you honestly say that I, I was the only one
You think your filthy words seem to realise
That I was lost at the end of all your options
When you were always on the top of my priorities

This was all on us, and we can't take it back

The secrets out and all I hear
Is the fire burning down our bridges
Still I carry you home through the fire and the flames
If you need me there you know I will be

I can always speak for myself in this
But I won't regret not saying what I needed to say

I fucking miss you

I am on my knees
I am on my knees

The secrets out and all I hear
Is the fire burning down our bridges
Still I carry you home through the fire and the flames
If you need me there you know I will be
It doesn't matter if our bridges are burning, our bridges are burning
Cause if you need me there you know I will be
