I am the heart inside
That beats with every strength I got.
I will never let you down.
I'd give it all
Until the day you shut me down.

We sing this song for you.
You are my pier but still I'm lost at sea.
Your guiding lights are running out.
My eyes are set on life.

You said it out
No holding back
The ocean depth has taken you away.

Don't let it go.
Keep holding on.
Or they will bury you
At the bottom of the sea.

I still believe
Without holding back
That there is hope for you
I'll keep your fire burning.

I am the heart inside
That beats with evertime you need a comfort.
Unitl the you fucking die.
'Cause I know that deep down inside
We both are stronger than this.

My eyes are set on survival.
Death will not lay his hands on us.
My eyes are set on life.

You said it out
No holding back
The ocean depths has taken you away.

Don't let it go
Keep holding on
Or they will bury you at the bottom.
Let's go.

You are the light in a darkened room.
You are the light going down in the skyline.
Every word that you say speaks of hope.
All your actions are bounded by strength.
You are the smile that I see all around.
You are the fire that never will die.
But I promise I'll be by your side
Together, forever my love.

Death will not lay his hands on us.
My eyes are set on life.
