Life will prevail.
As long as the sun still rise
And the sun still sets
My heart will beat and I will survive.
I will never be alone again.

There comes a day when you need to stand up
And shrug away all doubt inside
Stand strong and push it away.

One day you're in one day you're out.
It's called the circle of life.
But I know - You rack them up
Then I'll keep on swingin'

Can you see the sun going down
Before your eyes?
The warmth from the lights
That slowly fades out.
You're alone tonight.
You buried your heart six feet underground.

I hate to say this but
You've lost yourself too many times.
And I will not be your comfort
When it suits your heart.
I'm not alone. I'm stonger. I'm wiser than
I ever was with you. So take your fucking shit
And leave.

There's nothing but a hole in your chest.
You scandalous bitch.

Can you see the sun going down
Before your eyes?
The warmth from the lights
That slowly fades out.
You're alone tonight.
You buried your heart six feet underground.

There were millions of times each day
That I thought of you.
But we grew up to be nothing like the way
That you said.
I feel apart when the pieces you stole from me
Made me lost and incomplete.

These heavy hearts won't bring me down.
We were the ones
Who would die on the battle ground.
At the end of the road I will overcome.
You are not me. You will never be this strong.
