Do you remember when we were kids?
We had innocence, we had it all figured out.

We were the voice of a thousand
And we weren't afraid to shout it out.
We used to roam the streets not carrying about the consequences.
But you brought poison to your life
And you spread it to your veins.
Like the teeth from a vicious snake;
Your chemical disease

I know that things got hard on you.
You got in bed with the devil.

I still remember us being young and so full of life.

So don't close your eyes
'Cause there is so much beauty left for us to see.
And you must never be afraid to let go, to let go from the past.
You are a miracle, my friend.
From now until the bitter end.

Let's go!

Life is the sand running through the hour glass.
One grain at a time just passing through
I know that everything takes time but in the end time takes everything; just stay alive.

I hope that things will turn for that you wake up from this nightmare.
'Cause I remember us being friends and so full of love

So don't close your eyes
'Cause there is so much beauty left for us to see.
And you must never be afraid to let go, to let go from the past.
You are a miracle, my friend.
(Don't forget who your friends are)
So don't close your eyes
'Cause there is so much beauty left for us to see.
And you must never be afraid to let go, to let go from the past.
You are a miracle, my friend.
From now until the bitter end.
