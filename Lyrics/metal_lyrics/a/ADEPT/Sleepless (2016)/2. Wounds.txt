Sing from the heart,
Let them hear what our love is made of.

My heart's afflicted, everywhere I turn it reminds me of you.
How we could write our headlines and make the world spin just for us?
But we are not in motion,
Everything I feel is tied to our past.
And even though I do regret saying all those hurtful things to you
I can't ignore the fact that we've drifted off where there's no turning back.
I lay my head down low, I keep hiding my heart away.
Forever this way.

The passion that we had inside I will never regret,
I learned to live, to forgive and forget.
The fire inside our hearts will never be dimmed,
But it won't burn for you and me.

My heart will not be compromised,
I won't drag my feet to a dead beat. [2x]

Let me hold your hand one last time,
Let me lead you on your way back home, to the age of your innocence.
I'll let you hold my heart one last time as you slowly turn away from here
Towards a life without me.

Sing from the heart,
Let them hear what our love is made of.
I lay my head down low, I keep hiding my heart away.
Forever this way.

There is an ocean between us now.
But we can't swim with our heavy hearts.
I hear your voice from the distance
"I don't love you, not anymore"

My heart will not be compromised,
I won't drag my feet to a dead beat. [2x]

Let me hold your hand one last time,
Let me lead you on your way back home, to the age of your innocence.
I'll let you hold my heart one last time as you slowly turn away from here
Towards a life without me.

There's an ocean between us.
We can't swim with our heavy hearts.
I will carry the burden to the bottom of our regrets.
So take your final breath and let your lungs be filled with the death of our love.
