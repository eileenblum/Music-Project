I'm standing on the edge of life
With one foot in the air
And the other one on the solid ground

I always lived like there's no tomorrow
But lately I live like there's no today
And I can't think of a reason for me to stay

Winter came and we follow the seasons
We grew colder without a reason
We should have kept this warmth and instead we choose to bare arm

And I just can't sleep
Not after this

The picture of us is fading
Like the leafs on trees at the end of all
In the end when we'll be left
Will you remember me at all?

When you're longer adolescence
So I keep fighting the hands of time
Because time here is off the essence

I remember that time so pure and I want it back
Because I miss the feeling of being secure

So hear my voice through the echoes,
Through the subtle wave of the discord
It's a drop in the sea
But it's so important that you hear me

The sun never felt so cold
How can we grow when the fields are dead?
How can we love when we hate instead?
Our passion was supposed to be timeless
Have left my heart being restless and sleepless

You want forgiveness?
Now I want time to go backwards
To take back the years
I gave away to someone who's heartless
But maybe I don't deserve to be happy?

Since misery loved a company
Why don't you stick around with me?

And what you promise me from the start
You break as easily as my heart

So come and watch me fall apart

Are you listening?
Can you hear me out in this song?
Let me open my heart, let me tell you
How we went from right to wrong
Am I the one to blame?
Did I start this fire by myself?
Am I supposed to dream when these nights without you
Made me sleepless

I just can't sleep
Not after this, not after this

Sing it!

I can't sleep with these voices inside
I keep hearing your of regret
Like it's up to you to decide

Put your hand on my mouth so I'll sleep
Take my breath away
Like you always did
Come smother me so I can sleep

I am sick and tired and weak
I am hopeless and fragile, a freak.
Will you sing me to sleep in the end?
Will it ever end? [2x]
