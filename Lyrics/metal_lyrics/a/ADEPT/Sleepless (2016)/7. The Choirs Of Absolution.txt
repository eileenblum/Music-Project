Let them sing on my final hour
The sound of choirs
Lift me up from my sea of sins
So let them sing the anthem of death

This is my call to arms
A final gasping breath
The wind is roaring through
The anthem of my death
and now I hope that the choirs of absolution
Will sing me to sleep when my time is over

I know that my days are numbered
Three, two, one
We will live forever
I'll grow towards the neverending
I lay my head to rest while the choirs are singing

Let it be the sound that you remember
When they sink me down
Underneath the ground
Will the memories of me still weigh me down?
Let it be the voice of absolution
That sets me free
Only darkness awaits for the ones that will not see

Only death awaits for the weak
Sing me to sleep

I feel the cold surround me
Wherever I may turn I feel the wrath inside me
Yeah I've been living my life without my eyes
And I've never felt the warmth of the sun om the skyline

I am sorry for everything
For every drop in the sea of my sins
With the death grip on me
I lay my head to rest while the choirs are singing

Let it be the sound that you remember
When sink me down
Underneath the ground
Will the memories of me still weigh me down?
Let it be the voice of absolution
That sets me free
Only darkness awaits for the ones that will not see
Let them sing
Let the dead hearts sink here
At the neverending
I have a life but I never been living
So close my eyes cause I never been seeing
It's like my heart has never been beating
Sing me to sleep in the end
Where death awaits

Sing me to sleep
