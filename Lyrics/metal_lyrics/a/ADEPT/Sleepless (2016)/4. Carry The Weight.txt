This is our legacy!

With the weight of the world, on our tired shoulders
We refuse to live our lives in the dark
What we leave behind us is another dead heart left to rot
Or will we mark our presence?

Let's divide the masses, to the ones who lead
And to the ones who simply follow
Who will live for tomorrow?

We'll turn it back around,
We've strayed from our path and lost the track of being free.
I've learned to live that
Facing the sun, shadows fall back behind me

We live our lives underneath the burning sky
With the weight of the world
The weight of the world, on our tired shoulders

The sun will rise, keep facing the sky, don't close out your eyes
We can't stay blind forever
Set sail for a new horizon, the stars will guide
No matter what lies in our way
We'll lead, not follow the heavy hearts of sorrow

We'll turn it back around,
We've strayed from our path and lost the track of being free.
I've learned to live that
Facing the sun, shadows fall back behind me

We live our lives underneath the burning sky
With the weight of the world
The weight of the world, on our tired shoulders
We walk down on the longest road for us
To keep track of who we were to be
When will we ever be free with our heavy burden?

Here we stand, at the top of the world
With the wind in our back
Together we are invincible. [2x]

Show them our strength!
