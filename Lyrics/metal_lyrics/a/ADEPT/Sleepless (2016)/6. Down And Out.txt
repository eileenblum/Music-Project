Your words can't hurt me now.

I reminisce all the nights growing up that I spent all alone except the presence of a stomach ache.
Feeling sick to the bone with the thought of the words they would say.
When will these days fucking go away?
Being pushed all around to the ground I grow up feeling nothing but a hole inside.
Because of you being heartless I grow up being friendless and hopeless in a world that second guesses.

You fucking bully.
You fucking prick.
You fucking coward.
You fucking dick.

You left me down and out again.
I had to pick up the pieces.
To mend this broken heart of mine I had to rewind and start again.
You left me down and out again.
I had to pick up the pieces.
To mend this broken heart of mine I had to rewind and start again.

I didn't have the length nor the strength.
I stood out from the crowd.
And fucking vultures circling all around.
I was twelve years old and at a point I remember thinking this is not the way I want my life to be told.

I have faced my demons.
I built me up when you were dragging me down and at the lowest point I saw the shatters of a self-esteem belonging to my broken dream.

Fuck you.

You left me down and out again.
I had to pick up the pieces.
To mend this broken heart of mine I had to rewind and start again.
You left me down and out again.
I had to pick up the pieces.
To mend this broken heart of mine I had to rewind and start again.

Because of you being heartless I grow up being friendless and hopeless in a world that second guesses.
I was twelve years old and feeling lifeless.

Your words can't hurt me now.
