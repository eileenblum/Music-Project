we need everyone's attention!
there are words that must be said
we will never bite our tongues again
because everything they hold is the greatest lie
and i watch the sun go down over an empty street
but none of us sleeps tonight
we are the ones who must make a stand
as it all comes down to this

and even though we at times seem helpless
we must always strive forward

on the brightest path i recall your name
yet the shadows settles in for the very first time
hands are shaking cold. heartbeats racing fast.
but tonight it's heart and soul versus none

don't, don't lose hope
this isn't over yet
we are staring at the beginning
we will not stand for the business of living
come on and dance away another year of disaster!

we need everyone to listen up! to the frailty words that we say!
bring back our fucking strength - pick up yourself
in a world filled with hate -
we are the hope!
we are the cure!

we've been sleeping for ages but never one did we dream of this
that the bitter taste of disillusion is just enough to keep us underneath the surface
now i can't change my past, but who the fuck are you to predict my future
the shadows we cast define our soul purpose, therefore our wings must be broken.
it's in our hands and we need everyone's attention
that hand in hand we will walk these streets 
with more pride and courage than ever before

on the brightest path i recall your name
yet the shadows settles in for the very first time
hands are shaking cold. heartbeats racing fast.
but tonight it's heart and soul versus versus versus none

days like these won't last forever.

let's go
