I am reaching for it
As I have done my entire life
Patiently reaching for a meaning
A momentary taste of hope is what I long for
Happiness
Solitude
Strength
Survival

When will someone just open their eyes?
And step out from the shadows
We are living amongst the dead
Waiting for the next attack
With one last gasping breath

Our hearts
Turns pitch black
Our hearts
They're resting in your hands

Show us a meaning. give a sign to the world
For I am failing so desperately tonight

Just give me something to believe in. Something to hope for
And I would walk a million miles for your touch
This isn't reason enough. To keep going strong.
I fear that the sun won't rise anymore
(I am stronger)

Reach for the stars
Though you're heading for less
There's no shame in dreaming
Tonight

We are the dead
This is our hell

It shakes my soul to say this
But a fire will wrap around
And cover what's left in this city
As the dead will walk the earth!
We are the dead, come burn away
We are the dead, this is our hell
We have set this town on fire just to watch the unfaithful's burn

Just give me something to believe in. Something to hope for
And I would walk a million miles for your touch
This isn't reason enough. To keep going strong.
I fear that the sun won't rise anymore
