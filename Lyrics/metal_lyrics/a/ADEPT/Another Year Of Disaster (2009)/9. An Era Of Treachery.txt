THIS WILL BE THE END OF YOU!
(Ladies and gentlemen, friends and foeâs, 
this song goes out to all you fucking quitters out there)

How dare you stare at the ground when you
donât even know which direction to go?
Are you really that anxious to drift life away,
and just give up on yourself?

You better dance to the beat of living.
Start taking control and take care of yourself.
Reach out for help if youâre falling,
We're in this together.
Youâre in this alone.

Don't be proud enough to reach out for help.

She's on fire but her embers burn her bridges.
And she knows that she canât walk on water.
Yet she tries.
For what is worse than to ask your friends for help.
And so she sinks to the bottom of the sea.

Burn out the eyes of the traitors face.
They have told their final line.
They have told their final line.

One more time we'll throw down our fucking fists.
To anyone who stand against us.
To anyone who disagree.

Stop chasing your shadow. You're in this alone.
You need to fight until your heart stops beating.
Donât think for a second that you will be saved.
Hands down. It's over.

This is the end of everything.
And sure as hell iâm taking you with it.
I rather die with blood on my hands,
if my conscious is clean and my heart's been beating pure.

For what is living if you've already dead?

She's on fire but her embers burn her bridges.
And she knows that she canât walk on water.
Yet she tries.
For what is worse than to ask your friends for help.
And so she sinks to the bottom of the sea.

Weâre swimming and sinking,
Weâre running and falling,
Weâre breathing, not living,
Weâre crashing down!

We hold the answers in our hearts
as we been singing times before.
We spend every breath to stand our ground
but whatâs the point when we're sinking?
