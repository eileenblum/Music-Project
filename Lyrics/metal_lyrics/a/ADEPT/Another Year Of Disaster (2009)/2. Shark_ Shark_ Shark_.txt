Oh yea, C'mon

Our blood thirst never ends!

We are the ones who never has regrets to walk right through you!
We show no conscious and we will feed forever
You laid your soul into the fragile you call your life.
But who remembers an outcast who lives in vain?
With sharpened teeths we are breaking an entry.

So has your precious heart stopped beating?
Tell it to me straight
I want to know which side you're on!
I want to know which side you're on!
Bring all your friends!
Let's throw a party!
Bring all you friends!

And as this night settles in covering this city with nothing but darkness
Our night has just started to bring back the life to the sharks that we are.

I howl the moon letting you know that the boys are back.
Oh shit! we gonna do this right.
Damn straight! we have to break you down.
We'll slit the throats of everyone,
And show you things that happens in the movies, yea!
Movies!
So sing along motherfuckers
These things always happens in the movies
These things always yah-ah-ah-ah oh

So has your precious heart stopped beating?
Tell it to me straight
I want to know which side you're on!
I want to know which side you're on!
So please consider this wisely and just hold back your fear.
Just hold back your fear.

Don't try to ignore it.
There's blood on your hands!
And you can never wash of it
These stains are for life
The sharks will be feeding 
Of your souls in the night
And the longer you let them 
The closer you will come to the end!
