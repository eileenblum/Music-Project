a dance beneath the sparkling sky,
the silent touch of vivid grace.
your hand fits mine like a perfect match.
we kids in lust and the night is young
the dance we share will guide the way.
the unforgettable romance.
you whisper "hope" like no one else.
but only for tonight.
i am the bullet in your gun
you've had me loadet since the day one
so play your cards right girl,
this beating heart is yours to break!

this soldier surrenders,
don't hesitate now,
this is what you wanted all along.
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-
she locks and loads are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark.
she has those gorgeous piercing eyes,
red coloured lips that suck you dry
she is so fashion!
her words might seem to make things right,
but she will walk on your hopes and dreams tonight.
she is so fashion!
her words might seem to make things right,
she is so fashion, deadly fashion!
she's been the talk of our town.
so we all know that her words are poison

she'll fake a smile when the timing right
but that cunt will stab you in the back
her eyes are set to make the top.
she spread legs like a swing-door opens up
my bad, i started this rumour,
that you sell your mouth for a dollar!
and if i know her right, that precious little whore,
she's on her back screaming out for more.
with steady hands she makes her aim - oh oh oh-

she locks and loads, are you in her way?
her smile hits the mark
you better shake-shake-shake your body!
to the beat that we're making
you better shake-shake-shake your body!
to the music that we're spreading

you better dance-dance-dance forever
you're only pretty when you're sweating
you better shake-shake-shake you body

as we sing to you!
as we sing to you!
as we sing to you!

you always try to get everyone's attention
yet you always fail in each and every way tonight
