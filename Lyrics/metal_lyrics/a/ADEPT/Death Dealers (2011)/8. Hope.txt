It seems the we're only chasing after
The hopes and the dreams we had.
We don't trust ourselves in the present
So we linger on to the past.

Let's go!

I've bled it for the sake of moving forward.
I did it all in the name of promise.
We said we would never give in.
Yet your hearts has been changing it's way.
(We said we would never give in)

Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about trust.
I feel it slipping away.
Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about love.
It's all slipping away

We fought the battles and obstacles in our way.
But this struggle seems to get the best of us.
So we lost the only thing that mattered in the end.
This friendship is slipping away

It seems the we're only chasing after the hopes and the dreams we had.
We don't trust ourselves in the present.
So we linger on.

You were, you were the beginning, you were the end
You were, you were my everything
You were, you were the beginning, you were the end
You were, you were my everything

Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about trust.
I feel it slipping away.
(Forever) Forever isn't long enough when we speaking about love.
(Forever) is all slipping away
(Forever, isn't long enough)
