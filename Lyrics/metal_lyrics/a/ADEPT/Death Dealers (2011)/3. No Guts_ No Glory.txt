It's in your eyes.
I've seen it for sometimes.
The sadness within keep bursting like a gun.
You're under attack!
Your heart been wearing thin.
The ground that you stood will never be the same.

You're shaking.
You feel like letting go
You're whole world's collapsing

Woho woho -- This is the wake-up call
Woho woho -- For all the weary hearts
You don't belong in someone's shadow
So keep your fire alive, keep your fire alive

So just go!
I know you'll make it, you'll make it
Tomorrow brings another sun to embrace us.
So where will you stand?
In the shadow or in the light?

Reach out your hand, your not alone.
I know you're stronger than this.

Some live their lives without chasing a dream.
With no vision, no purpose, no goal.
But these lights will shine a new.
And this mouth will speak the truth.

Reach out your hand, your not alone.
Don't be scared what future may hold.
Reach out your hand, your not alone
It's just a matter of time.

Woho woho -- This is the wake-up call
Woho woho -- For all the weary hearts
You don't belong in someone's shadow.
So keep your fire alive.
