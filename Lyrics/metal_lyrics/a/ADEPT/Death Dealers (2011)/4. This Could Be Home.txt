You are the reason I open my eyes

This isn't changing from carrying hope
it seems like lost ambitions of a new beginning
I try to get myself back up
but these thoughts they drag me down
I'm fighting every second that I live without you now

And I will struggle a lifetime

I will never forget your touch
You are in my heart
I will never let go of your love
Always in my heart

These eyes have been searching for a reason
to carry on with a broken heart
These feet these feet have been running in circles
when my mind is giving in
I would cut my throat if it brought us back again

I will never forget your touch
You are in my heart
I will never let go of your love
Always in my heart

And I will cut my bone if it will bring her back

Tonight I see the sun set the skyline on fire and all I can think about is
where you will be when the darkness embrace you
Tonight I see the sun set the skyline on fire and all I can think about is
where you will be when the darkness embrace you
