Embrace the truth
We have make this downfall.
Never before and never again
will we be ashamed for who we are.

We kept burning bridges like there is nothing left to save
Days are getting shorter and all we do is running in circles.
I wanna see clean fucking fight!

It seems like the past keeps hunting daylight
reminding us of that we have failed
to obtain honor to stay alive.

Strangers. You passing life right by.
You hide your face and you ask no questions why.
So tell me strangers, are you happy where your are?
You have to see the beauty in the world through your eyes.

I know there is more, there must be more!
So turn it up, turn it up! The system overloads.
The voices of the future must be heard.
So gather around and take what is yours.
When all is said and done it is us against the world!

Strangers. You passing life right by.
You hide your face and you ask no questions why.
So tell me strangers, are you happy where your are?
You have to see the beauty in the world through your fucking eyes.

I know there is more, there must be more!
I know there is more, there must be more!

You're down for the count.
It goes 3 2 1. Go!

(We'll say, we'll say) This is the life we've chosen!
(We'll say, we'll say) This is our life!
