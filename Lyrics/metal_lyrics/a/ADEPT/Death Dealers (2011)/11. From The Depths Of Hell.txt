Right before my face the colors of the world fades away.
We are walking around like ghosts and I am overwhelmed by
the feeling of hopelessness.
A desperation settles in.
And all I want is for you to be proud of me.
Your hand is slipping out of mine.
'Cause all I want is for you to be proud of me.
A comfort I use to take for granted
I dry my eyes with the knowledge that I did what I could bare.

This is a song for the young believers.
A dedication to the keepers of the faith.
You make this choice if your in this to win it.
A dedication to the keepers of the faith.

I hold on to this memory that you had high hopes on me.
I know you don't, you don't.
I feel the cold surrounding me.
You're just letting me down.

This is a song for the young believers.
A dedication to the keepers of the faith.
You make this choice if your in this to win it.
A dedication to the keepers of the faith.

I'll catch the sun and bring it down for you
if it's you makes you warmer (makes you warmer).

So now you know that I'm back on my feet just to show you that I made myself a life
that you could be proud of and I wish that you could be there just to see me again
on the stage tonight singing songs in your name.

It's all in your name!
I scream my lungs out each night for a chance that you'll hear me.
But you never could hear me enough
I see a thousands other faces tonight
but no one recall your beautiful judging eyes.
