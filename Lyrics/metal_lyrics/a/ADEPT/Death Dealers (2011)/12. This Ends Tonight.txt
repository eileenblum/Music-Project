Don't speak a word!
You make more sense to me, with your mouth sewn shut!
I've been waiting for your move.
I can taste your weakness.
I can feel your fear.
In this moment of truth, all hell will break lose.

That's right motherfuckers, lets get shit poppin'!
I staring out the window
I see the sun give another day.
But I don't feel anything, I just don't feel a fucking thing.
There's nothing left to strive for, there's nothing left to win.
I don't believe in anything, I don't believe in anyone.
Just give me something to breathe, something to fill these lungs with.
Who will cure me now?
There's no tomorrow ahead that will bring me to shore.

This ain't the way I imagined the world would it turn into?
A black hole, a abyss,
A place where the light only shines on the fortunate ones

Where is your heart at?
When the sundown fades away?
This is the sound of burning bridges.
How could I ever be a part of this?
Your treachery eyes won't pierce me again.
This is the sound of burning bridges.
This is the end of our days, the end of it all.

This ain't the way I imagined the world would it turn into?
A black hole, a abyss,
A place where the light only shines on the fortunate ones.
Where will you be? Where will you be?

You said you would die for me.
I believed every word you said.
You said you would die for me.
So what are you waiting for?!

Your wear my heart on your sleeve with a smile on your face pretending you know me well.
I guess this is the time I supposed to say I'm sorry?
Your wear my heart on your sleeve with a gun in your hand and loaded it up with hopes.
I guess this is the time I supposed to say I'm sorry?

So fucking fire your gun at me!
Your bullets pierce through me. I'm down on my knees.
Spitting the blood, shutting my eyes
I never would thought you had this in you!
Fire your gun, pierce me with hope,
With my last final breathe I forgive you for everything!
