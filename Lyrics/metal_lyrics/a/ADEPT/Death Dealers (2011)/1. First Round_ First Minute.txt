Here we fucking go!

Drop it like it's hot - cold

Yeah!
I need to know if this weakened heart has strength to carry on
Another day around the ones who always brings me down.
I make beliefs around the thought that we could be so much more
We're glowing like the sparks in a fire.

Through the smoke you change your fucking act.
I still don't know what it means to you.
The time might heal the bruises in my soul,
but I won't forget your actions

We're sinking but I don't care if we make it.
We were always under the surface.

We let go of all the things we were certain of would hold.
Lets go drown here together.

In this darkest hour I need to find myself a light,
that will shine up on the path I'm heading for.
I have reached the shore.
I will stand my ground until the day that I close my eyes for the last fucking time

I reach up to the sky and believe if we're not in this together
I will would rather give up on our dream.
Your wore my heart like a fucking joke.

I reach up to the sky and believe
That the sun sets along with us.

We're sinking and I don't care if we make it.
We were always under the surface.

We let go of all the things we were certain of would hold.
Let's go drown here together.

I curse the day, you where fucking born!
