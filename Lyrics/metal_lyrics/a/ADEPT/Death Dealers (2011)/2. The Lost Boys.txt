We are the misfits of the world
We're writing songs and we want to
Sleep all day and party all night
We never grow old, we never die

Only we can, only we can
I feel so sick and tired
To watching this empathy
They run around these empty streets
Believing they have a purpose

I just cant understand, the meaning of their mission
We'll seek a day and make them say
Living inside of us

We'll suck out your poison
We'll feed on your person

Lets go, we are the shadows
Around each and every streetline
The living dead, forever young
The soldiers of the night

We are the misfits of the world
We're writing songs and we want to
Sleep all day and party all night
We never grow old, yeahhhh...
We are the misfits of the world
We're writing songs and we want to
Sleep all day and party all night
We never grow old, we never die...!

Every night is a fucking feast
(We will live forever)
We live a last without love
(We will live forever)

Only we can, only we can
Live forever
Whoever coming for your folks, you lied
Only we can, only we can
Live together
We thought days keep sinking in

You would have waste your fucking life
Why should I show you the glory of this
You would have waste your fucking life
Until' this boys open up your eyes
(eyes, eyes, eyes)

We are the end of the world
We will never die
We will never die

We are the misfits of the world
We're writing songs and we want to
Sleep all day and party all night
We never grow old, we never die
We are the misfits of the world
We're writing songs and we want to
Sleep all day and party all night
We never grow old...
We are the misfits of the world
We're writing songs and we want to
Sleep all day and party all night
We never grow old.
