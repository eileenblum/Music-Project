Set these guitars of fire baby!

Yeah I was making choices.
Every day was a fucking struggle.
I couldn't tell who to blame when everything went straight to hell.

I know, I know this isn't what we had in mind.
But at a certain point you need to realize
that abandoning the ship was for the best.

I could here the captain screaming:
"Mayday! It's an emergency!
We got a man overboard!
Prevent him from sinking!"

I only had my hope to keep my floating.
But piece by piece its crumbled down
I was getting flooded

I see, I see this world with brand new eyes now.
It's too a beating to realize what the hell I'm doing here.

Now I will conquer everyone with words of perseverance, perseverance!
We've seen hell from the inside so we ain't going back. (0 1 5 6!)

I have carried on this leap of faith.
Even though these times are changing.
We were a constant.
You and I where always a constant!
It shakes my world to see it fall.

The captain is screaming:
"Mayday! It is an emergency!
We got a man overboard!
Prevent him from sinking!"

I only had my hope to keep my floating
But piece by piece its crumbled down
I was getting flooded.

This is an emergency and we're running out of time!
We're counting down the seconds.
Until we all find air to breathe
Until we all find eyes to see
Until the lambs becomes the lions!

We were always a constant!
Let's go!
