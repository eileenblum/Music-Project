My heart bleeds and the anger inside me dwells
From an emotion so absent it burns.
Our feelings will turn into ashes.
She said: Its better if I leave...

But tonight you will die.
You will never wake up again.
My hope is my failure.

Why should I listen when nothing is said?
Cave-in when emotions are dead?
Its too late to speak from your heart anyway
Its better if you bleed.
(I will rise!)

I will raise my voice tonight.
Cause its the only way to get through you alright
But tonight I have never, ever felt so blind.

So here I sway above it all and I'm blinded by the words you told me.
So here I stand alone again and wasting another year on you.

Hear my voice! The screams in my lungs will be heard.
Like and echo repeating the words "I feel nothing for you anymore".
Well, my dearest, Hold my hand.
I will bring you with me to the ground.
If I fall, the fall becomes ours.
Its too late to speak from your heart anyway.
Its better if you die.

But not to forget all of the words you told me.
When all was spoken all I heard was
"But hurting you was the last thing I wanted to do".
When all was spoken all I heard was
"But hurting you was the last thing I wanted to do".

I've bled myself dry tonight for wanting more.
The cold wind sweeps beneath me.
Like a star shivering in darkness
and I will fall as well.
