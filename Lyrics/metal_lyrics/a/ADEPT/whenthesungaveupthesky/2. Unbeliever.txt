Why Suffer?
Unbeliever. It's just a word for the weak
Have you ever seen a sunset burn the horizon, burn the horizon?
Or When the colours in the autumn match the flames in the skyline,
Or the air from your mouth when you breathe in december.
You. You have to wake up, you have to wake up and see and you will
Find all the answers standing in front of you.

So you're standing there, with bloodshut eyes. You were pail and scared
Was it something I said?
(The Only time that I tried to tell you have much I loved you we faded)
(The Only time that I felt so right inside it meant Goodbye. Goodbye.)

A stained perfection, is this all you've been waiting for?
A chance to let go? Are you just feeling nothing? You must have felt something.
To make a difference into the life we choose to live.
You have to see with your eyes and start feeling something, start feeling something.

She said that everything will be just fine, tonight.
She held my hand and it would work out fine.
Tonight, everything will be just as fine.
Tonight, everything will be just as fine!
