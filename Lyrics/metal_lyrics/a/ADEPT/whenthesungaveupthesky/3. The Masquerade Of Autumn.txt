Ready. Get set. Scream.

Breathe, and for a first time taste the thought
that the words we left unsaid could easily have been the ones
which should have been spoken.
So why deny it? So why deny it?
If the silence speaks in riddles why won't you just speak up?

Just bring me back to something. Cause your the only one who makes these
sleepless nights fade away.
I can pretend that these wasted memories inside are dead.

And the young girl raised her voice. 
And she grinned with a smile as her waving hand got memorized inside my head. 
So why deny it? So why deny it?
We are only here for so long, there's no time to spend it wrong.

My impression of you my dear has been wearing thin,
wearing thin because your cold intentions from your cold,
dead heart was to rip me open and laugh at my inside

Just bring me back to something. Cause your the only one who makes these
sleepless nights fade away.
I can pretend that these wasted memories inside are dead.

The flashing light puts a different view in life.
There is a barrel burning hot
and the smoke, it signals for another heartache
Its funny how people say that your life shall pass you by but you are all, 
you're everything I see
