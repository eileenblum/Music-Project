[James:]
After a long journey
Part of the mystery is solved
I've achieved my purpose, finally
I came to a new world

I landed in a meadow
That goes for a mile
There isn't a single shadow
It all seems purified

Can this be a magical world
Better than my dear homeland?

My arrival was troubled
I still can't hear and see
There's life in this planet
It will come to me

I'll continue my discovery
Here I shall stand
There's so much to see
At this foreign land

Can this be a magical world
Better than my dear homeland?

[Robert:]
What was that heavy noise?
It flows from the space
Like a lightning god would ride
Bringing disgrace

I can't precise what it is
But I'm sure it's beyond this world
A vibration's still on my knees
A vibration of fear I can't hold

I should go there
But I'm scared
I'm afraid of what I will find
No, I'm a country man
I have to protect my land

[Maria:]
My manâ¦ Where is he?
He should be already home
Maybe he's just relaxing
After a hard day at work

He hates the city
He hates to go there
But someone has to ensure
The future of the child I bear

Please, come home
I'm falling in madness
Pay attention to your phone
And listen to my message:

"About the object that fell around
They're saying on TV
The frightening sound that we hear
It's dangerous to our family"
