[Robert:]
What a magical surprise
You look just the same as me
I can't believe this is right
Do you swear you're really an E.T.?

In the news, they say you're a danger
But you seem just another stranger

[James:]
I have no interest in harming you
I reject that miserable life
This isn't my world, but I'm real
Is it too soon for you to realize?

My plan is to learn about you
And I need your help for that

[Robert:]
You can count on me and I am glad to see
I'm the first you have met

How am I supposed to react
To this new, stranger fact?
How will this change my life?
I should go tell my wife

My mind is so confused and stoned
My heart has been deceived
I always thought we'd be here alone
But God changed what I believed

Is our creator the same as theirs?
Maybe there's another god
I want to know their own beliefs
Who rules them at the top

Are we, humans, prepared to receive new life?
We live with each other in a constant strife
How can we make our hearts smile
When the best we do is to be hostile?
