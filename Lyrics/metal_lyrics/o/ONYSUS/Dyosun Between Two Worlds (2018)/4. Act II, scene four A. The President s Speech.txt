[Frank:]
We dedicated lifetimes
To an unprogressive search
Trying to find new worlds
But they discovered us first

They're more developed than we thought
With stronger military forces
We should unite as a family
And fight for our last resources

Every patriotic man
Must himself volunteer
You must believe the end
Is not near

In the dawn of the battle's day, we shall pray
To our Lord, "Guide us in the right way."
In the dawn of the battle's day, we shall pray
To show all the worlds our victory
The victory of man
