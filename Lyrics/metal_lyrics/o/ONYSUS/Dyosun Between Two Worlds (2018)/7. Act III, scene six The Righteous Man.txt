[Frank:]
Servants, grab your weapons
It's time for the show
Don't care about what shall happen
The alien needs to go

The final attack is prepared
It must be quick and fatal
Make sure he isn't aware
Avoid a huge battle

And, my loyal soldiers, do not bother
With collateral damage
Those who will stay in our way
Shall be punished

Cleaning our path
Leaving no regret
Killing for the new world

Planting a new lie
Deceiving every eye
Feeding the beasts inside

[Robert:]
My friend, you're not alone
I'll struggle with you side by side
I'll cut his veins, spilling his blood
That president deserves to die

Death is running
Through my fearsome body
Killing is becoming
My favorite hobby

Cleaning all the mess
Leaving no regret
Killing for a free world

Fighting the evil trend
Protecting our new friend
Releasing the righteous man

[James:]
Robert, you've got to leave this place
[Robert:]
No, I'll cover you 'til you arrive to space
[James:]
You shouldn't fight against your neighborhood
[Robert:]
"My country is the world, but my religion is to do good" 1

[Frank:]
Your special friend (your stranger friend)
May run away (may run away)
But in the end, you are the one who will pay

I told you the right thing to do
But you chose the wrong path
I don't know why people contradict me
They should know the extent of my wrath

Your special and stranger friend
May run away but in the end
You are the one who will pay

[Local radio broadcast:]
"The military forces have arrived with tremendous violence, starting to shoot against the alienâ¦ Explosions, shots, screamsâ¦ It's a grim scenario of full destructionâ¦ and all of this against a guy who hasn't been hostile? Is this necessary? That's the question we're starting to ask. Holyâ¦ We can observe the presence of a human being covering the alien, while he's trying to fly into spaceâ¦ There are more people joining him to helpâ¦ People are turning against the military forces! People are turning against the system.

[Maria:]
Please, Robert, come home
I'm terrified, here alone
[Robert:]
My mission is almost complete
Soon I'll be home, believe in me
But now I am

Cleaning all the mess
Leaving no regret
Killing for a free world

Fighting the evil trend
Protecting our new friend
Releasingâ¦

[Frank:]
Goodbye, Robert!
