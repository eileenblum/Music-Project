[Frank:]
Hello, Robert. How you doing?
You must be OK, sharing two nations
I heard your son was born on Monday
Well, from the heart, my congratulations

I don't have too much time
So, I'll be pretty clear
As a smart man you are
I assume you know why you are here

You can't support that E.T.
Are you out of your brilliant mind?
He can be dangerous to your family
How can you be so blind?

[Robert:]
Mr. President, I'm doing fine
But I don't need your concerns
I reject your praise to change my mind
You're the only one here who's blind

You are dazed by money and power
Which never lasts forever
In the dawn of the battle's day
You'd better pray

The end is near, it's closest the hour
Abandon that chair, I know you're clever
Bring war to me, I'll bring war to you
You wanted a new ally
But now I'm your enemy too

In this path, I shall tread
If this is wrong, on hell we shall talk

[Frank:]
Bow is the right word
Listen to your loyal lord
Stay in the God's border
Show me a new respect
And obey my official order
