[I.	The Returning Trip]

[James:]
Goodbye real friend I'll never forget

Finally, I said goodbye
To that unmerciful world
Keeping in the eye
All I have learned

My friends are waiting
For me and the novelties
I'm glad Robert gave me
A better story to tell
Beyond Earth's policies

I made a real friend
Which I'll never forget
I am so glad for that day
The day when we met

His name should be remembered
I'll guarantee he will be immortalized
Here he shall rise
His courage and bravery are unique and special
To a kind of heaven he will rise!

[II.	Home, Sweet Home]

There's nothing more peaceful
Than returning to my home
After a journey in another land
Far away from my ocean foam

The Dyo breathes in my face
Closing my sad eyes
I can forget all I saw
Until the moment he dies

Shine, Dyo, on my land
Illuminate my town
It's me, your lovely fan
Who cries until the dawn

Shine, Dyo, for me,
Spilling glow through my road
Shine till eternity
Bringing us hope
Shine, Dyo, on my land
Spilling glow for your lovely fan
Bringing hope of a better universe
In the human soul inhabits a curse

[III.	Memories]

In the shadows alone
Lost, on my own
The past comes alive
While I try to write

Memories come to my mind
Water flows through my eyes
There's something we must do
To erase the pain they can't get through

[IV.	The Final Report]

Upon reaching that planet
I wished to know more
Pulling me like a magnet
I would unlock all the doors

The elements seemed at harmony
Such a tranquil place
But that would not be the case
After I've met its master-race

The human species stood
Ruling the entire world
I've never thought they could
Ever be that cold

Some were intelligent,
Kind and even brave
And at the same time
Ignorant, so cruel and insane

The powerful had too much
No god could be the judge

And the weak had too little
Extremes overwhelmed the middle

The balance was broken
No time to live the moment

There is something wrong
Justice underwhelms the strong

[V.	Dyo's Surveillance]

The night has come
And my spirit is low
So great was the suffering
Of being away from home

The flame life created within me
The winter concealed it in ashes
The breeze of summer may raise it
Before the universe's clashes

The dawn is coming
Enlightening this land
Dyo is watching
Over our friends

Warm hearts beating in
Bodies that move the sand
Our brethren will be saved

No right or wrong
No king or law, no peace or war
There is no mountain to hold us back
The sight of freedom shall rise again

Dyo will guide us
In the right way to the horizon
It's our great shining star
That brings hope

The sinners I've met, the hatred fed
The missing signs of human regret
The lies they told, secrets to unfold
Paintings of a tragic world

No respect, selfish act
My real friend could still be there
Perfection boils on Earth's core
But the surface is spoiled with endless war

No star should shine in such a dark worldâ¦
