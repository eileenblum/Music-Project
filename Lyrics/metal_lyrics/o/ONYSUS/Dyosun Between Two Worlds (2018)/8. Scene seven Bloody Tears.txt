[James:]
How is she supposed to react?
To this bloody fatal act
How will she guide her life?
She's now a solitary wife

With a child to care
And unable to do it alone
With her voice reflecting despair
She begs in a higher tone

[Maria:]
"Come, come and lay him in his father's arms
My spirit can no longer bear these harms" 2

[James:]
Terrifying place
People devoid of grace
I can't believe these things that I saw
They live breaking the law

A great loyal man died
Fighting against his own homeland
Leaving, without a father, his own child
Leaving his wife in a pain she can't stand

[Maria:]
"Come, come and lay him in his father's arms
My spirit can no longer bear these harms"

You're bleeding now, in my arms
The pain consumes your body
Freezing the deepest scar

I'm bleeding now
Inside my heart
The pain consumes my soul
While you're flowing to the stars

There's nothing more terrifying
Than seeing your love slowly dying
He can no longer calm down my fears
He's now the reason of my bloody tears

[2 Taken from King Henry VI, part I, act IV, scene VII, by Arden Shakespeare]
