[Robert:]
If we follow the orders of the president
This world will never be the same
We must protect our new resident
Or we will lose too early this game

Instead of opening a new door
You're building a wall
The worst will befall

The world will turn into a piece of misery
It will be the biggest disaster of history
The world will become a field of bloody war
There won't be humans anymore

[James:]
My lords will not invade Earth
Will humans fight against only me?
I must get back to my home
But my ship is out of energy

My lords could send me some help
But it won't arrive in time
Robert, I don't want to die

Before I want to see
All this world has to give
What's the reason to come here
And be thrown to the sea?

[Frank:]
As far as I'm concerned
We should open fire
But he is here alone
With no one by his side

Except for that farmer
Where he has landed

Robert, is that his name?
I want to meet him.
He is the one I shall blame
I hate when I have to be grim

[Robert:]
The world will turn into a piece of misery
It will be the biggest disaster of history
The world will become a field of bloody war
There won't be humans anymore

[Frank:]
The voices who are contesting our final decision
Aren't aware of what is the real threat
The plan is too damn clear: to conquer our mother Earth
And send all of us to the land of Seth
