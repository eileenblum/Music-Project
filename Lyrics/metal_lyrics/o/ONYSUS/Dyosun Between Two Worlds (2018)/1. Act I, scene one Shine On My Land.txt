Act I
Scene one

[Robert]:
Thereâs nothing more pleasant
Than returning to my land
After a day on the city
Far away from the sand

The sun breathes in my face
Blinding me from the lies
I can forget everything I know
Until the moment he dies

Shine, Sun, on my land
Illuminate my town
Itâs me, your countryman
Who cries until the dawn

Shine, Sun, for me
Spilling glow through my road
Shine for my family
Until you explode
