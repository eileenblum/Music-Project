Watch the stars see their light
Million of years shine down
Cold and bright endless dark
Just little points of warmth and light

Like our lives dissipate, not concentrated
Desensitized torn between, all distracted

Tranquilized

Don't ignore the signs of older power
The power of Abramelin and The Beast
The power of hate and fear, that make us invincible
Secrets protected through the ages

Feed 'em with your puking hate!
Show the creatures you're not afraid
Feed them with your vile hate

Initiate the old words
Breaking the walls of sanity
Let your mind see the ancient gods
and take control of almighty power

Transcend the river of blindness
Use your power for creation
The rules of Abramelin are your destination
Enslave the darkness under your will

Awake the forsaken, listen to their godless words
Older species from other stars, cold and merciless
Darker demons from lower hell -
lurking and crawling - our physics fail
Echoes of torture, screams of despair
from thousand victims flavour the air

Speak the mantra, speak it loud
Enslave the creatures of the night
Unchain my power, unchain my will
The reality we see is not real

Vomit your hate
Show the creatures you're not afraid
Feed them with your vile hate

Meditating with closed eyes and raised middle fingers
They will try to stop you from trespassing their dominions
Cold and dark a cosmos of endless entity
All may be yours, take control of all energy
