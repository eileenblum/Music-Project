Lying in the exile in rigor ascesis
Incorruptible by the illusion of taboo
Distancing from humanity, pure through impurity
Walking the way of an Aghori Sadhu

Black and white, the same old wheel
moves on and turns, this is the deal!
Evanescence of the body brings jewellery to light
To our great Mother Kali, brought to delight

Om Kali - Om Kali, Kali

My altars are the dead
Worldly customs I have shed
Karma suppresses the instinct
to abdicate from this very brink
Living in disgusting trash
Feasting on rotten, human flesh

Ash is a witness of time
Aspect of a goddess of mine
I smear this crap all over me
to open Third Eye to see

Om Klim Kalika - Yei Namaha

Om Klim Kalika - Yei Namaha

Movement as performance in transcendental reality - Om Kali
Opposites not endorsed - they're ultimately illusory
Rites of pollution to realize non-duality - Om Kali
Lord Shiva in perfection becoming one with Mother Kali

Asato Ma Sat Gamaya

To celebrate life I worship the dead
The one is the other, balanced when it's paired
Removing the bonds - my highest desire
My body is ash, my spirit is fire

Finding salvation from
pleasure and shame, pride and pain
Hatred and fear, obsession and greed
