Look at this pit!
Disgusting isn't it?

The mana I obtain from this world of pain, an overfull source,
full of deprivation, a struggle every day
Forget your wealth and ensconce yourself in pestilential vapours
A place reigned by the law of hunter and prey

Horrendous potential
for evil force
Collecting essentials
Extracting souls

Masses and massed in desperate trial licking each other's spit
To get rid of the thirst, to get rid of the hunger,
they even have to swallow shit
Forced to sell all of their habits
to make one more day in this pit
A breeding ground for destructive tendencies...

Welcome to the rabid in the juggernaut
An overkill of madness, malice and fraud
Wrath grows like a monster
Kill to stay alive - fair play is a fault
Fed by the rabid in the juggernaut
Wrath grows like a monster

Anger and greed, hate and deceit
Seeds that perfectly spear in these streets
Thousands demise a perfect sacrifice
for the creatures I invoke to rise
Feeding on humans embracing their darkness
Mankind is an overfull source
Creatures of wrath, glory bloodbath
Clean the streets of men, show no remorse!

Show no remorse!
Show no remorse!

Masses and massed in desperate trial licking each other's spit
To get rid of the thirst, to get rid of the hunger,
they even have to swallow shit
Forced to sell all of their habits
to make one more day in this pit
A breeding ground for destructive tendencies...
