The path we are walking every day
Footprints, thousands took before
Struggling at expected points
Finding the expected but nothing more

Doubt your fate
A fucking vice
Choose your gate
and throw the dice!
Improvise!

Self-deceiving lies selected
Intrinsic truths stubborn rejected

In the instant of epiphany
we're blind by eye-blink reflex
and cherish false safety
Celebrate it as highest award
Prevarication's easy
so we don't have to reflect
Continue and keep busy
Aren't we all retards?

Doubt your fate
A fucking vice
Choose your gate
and throw the dice!
Improvise!

Not longer able to face this face this soul-eating daily grind
No longer able to live this life built on lies
See lurking and deriding things and guess a spot of sickening horror
As sick as we are in the absurd and monotone lives

Trying to shout out death, spots on this globe
Speckles of dust in the universe,
so self-important, always aspire see the light
The perfect human as an over ideal, impossible to go there

And the darkness is laughing
And the darkness is laughing
Embrace this idea of imperfection
and face the abyss

Doubt your fate
A fucking vice
Choose your gate
and throw the dice!
Improvise!

The veil of oblivion
The fog when darkness is breathing
Embracing death's delirium
And the darkness is laughing
