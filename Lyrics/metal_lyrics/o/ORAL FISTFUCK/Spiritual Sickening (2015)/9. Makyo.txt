The journey of the soul, is hard to control
Numerous paths and teachings to explore
but the way to the, light through darkness and night
leads through valleys full of terror
The teachings I've learned, like candles they burned
Shining the way, but now they have gone
Yet it's too late, in this cave full of hate
I'm drowning!

Visions of a nemesis,
before transcending the river I've been warned from this
Finding myself in a pit of rage,
where gods of chaos are rising, me improvising
In rigor ascesis I've opened the cage

The journey is long, the stages are con
Implanting compelling desires
The flesh is weak of the mind is meek
Hit by concentric circles of fire
Prioritizing of self-interest and my own benefits,
fuck the rest!
Power and wealth I claim for myself
Bondage's the dismiss of the pursuit of bliss

Facing the real world - facing affliction
This Makyo turned my conviction

Turn my back against authorities, impulsively adjusted
Ending in obesity, all discipline is lost

Shifting priorities,
this devil's cave imprisons me

The idea of my instance
is the riddle between me and transcendence
Circulating thoughts in each mulligan
mind's spinning in spirals over and over again

The idea of my instance
is the riddle between me and transcendence
Circulating thoughts in each mulligan
mind's spinning in spirals over and over again

I see the universe black and white,
higher questions imprisoning me
Manifesting a parasite by claiming a subjective being
Thoughts spreading like pestilence, contaminating the truth
Despite all perseverance not able to conclude
Smite down
To the ground
My soul is deaf
Lost its path
