Can you accept that the world you see, is just a point of view?
Corrupting, imprisoning every cell of you
Overcoming boundaries - thinking in a different stage
If you believe in black and white you're owned by the cage

Narrowing mind, with bars behind,
blurred eyes, infected with lies
Tied hands, a stranger's voice,
ignoring the truth, by own choice?
Imagine a hunter pacing around,
store its potential on minimal ground

God of the weather demands tribute
Cares of your matters if you pursue
Beholding an instinct, an upcoming rage
Scratching the walls inside of the cage

God of the weather demands tribute
Cares of your matters if you pursue
Beholding an instinct, an upcoming rage
Scratching the walls inside of the cage

Don't you feel the abnorm?
Something you can't explain
Raging like a storm
Whispering to your brain
It's the call of Tlaloc
It's my call

Sooner or later a suppressed force
will take a collateral, destructive course
Releasing an instinct, an out bursting rage
Smashing its way to escape the cage

Suffering of hunger, drought and disease?
The tears of your infants suffice my greed
Drown and impale them! Cage them to cry!
Cornucopias get refilled by acres that don't dry

Without my mercy, endure my rage!
For much too long I have been in my cage
Serve me your brood! Their tears are the key
A victim so pure, delighting me
The more they suffer, by enduring pain
Crying rivers of tears - fertilising pain
The more they suffer, by enduring pain
Crying rivers of tears - fertilising pain

Tear down the walls, tear all the chains
Release the power that flows through my veins
