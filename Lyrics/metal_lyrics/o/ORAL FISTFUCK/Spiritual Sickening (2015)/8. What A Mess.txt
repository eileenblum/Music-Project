What a fucking mess!

Introducing the adoption, through between dimensions
Tentacles from gods of chaos don't know any remorse
Reaching us pathetics with uncontrollable force
They shall be mine! Through my call I claim possession
Serve my call for I'm the leader of the ritual
Your embodiment - my sovereignty

But there's no compromise with a god
There's no compromise with a god
There's no compromise with a god
There's no compromise with the...

Gods of chaos take control, tear my authority into bits
They own what we have stolen and share nothing of it
Focused on what they've aimed to, did I believe in negotiation?
They're back and they'll do, the same before our evolution
Blown landscapes, boiling oceans - life gets redesigned
Shadows upon cities - prophesying the reaping of mankind

Dissolving every fucking rest of matter
I just can watch what is unbound
Turning physics upside down
Drifting into non-sense
A catastrophe?
See! Chaos is consent
A change of hierarchy

Aspiring for power but learning lessons in defeat,
oh! What a mess!
Instead of reigning, I've become one of the least,
what a fucking mass!

Don't fear! No doubt! There'll be a tearing into the vortex
Let go! Open your mind for knowledge, cold, so cold even ice cracks
Don't look for patterns or rules in a random set matrix

Random set matrix
Random set matrix
Random matrix

Reality has failed with it's concept of symmetry
A cosmos unscaled brings opportunities

The adoption occurred - gone all that we've known
Order and chaos concurred - negated in vacuo

What a mess - fucking mess!
What a mess - fucking mess!
