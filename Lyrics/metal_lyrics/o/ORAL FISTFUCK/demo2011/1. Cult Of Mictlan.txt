long time hidden in the past, just the desert wind whispers your name
great and dreadful is your hunger and your table is so overfull
worshiped and feared by your followers like every god
no one measures up to you and you never betrayed

you name the rules
and the crowd accept it
easy rules since ages and ages

anyhow, your power slowly lost away
it goes the way it always goes
they stop believing in you
a new power was rising
and changed the faith of the temples and priests
behind the black maria
it was always your face
bud priests suspected of an ancient monstrosity

blood and soul for pain and hate
blood and soul for pain and hate
mictlantlecuhtli
death god sacrifice

the crowd knew it all the time
just follow the bat and the owl
remember the old times
what a massacre
when the new god`s downfall begins
you know your time is coming again
remember the old times
what a massacre

blood and soul for pain and hate
cult of mictlan
rise again
deathgood sacrifice
pain and hate
cult of mictlan
rise again blood and soul
death god sacrifice

[2x]
a desert winds plannings the bones
cult of mictlan prayers to a blood god
at the backside of your churches
you can found his signs

[2x]
cult of mictlan
deathgood sacrifice
cult of mictlan
deathgood sacrifice
long time hidden in the past, just the desert wind whispers your name
great and dreadful is your hunger and your table is so overfull
worshiped and feared by your followers like every god
no one measures up to you and you never betrayed

you name the rules
and the crowd accept it
easy rules since ages and ages

anyhow, your power slowly lost away
it goes the way it always goes
they stop believing in you
a new power was rising
and changed the faith of the temples and priests
behind the black maria
it was always your face
bud priests suspected of an ancient monstrosity

[9x]
have you questioned what happens to the soul of a god?
