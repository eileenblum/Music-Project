Gathered in circle Gods decide
the fate of men that had the courage
to seek for the unkonn;
The path was written with stars
and they chosen to transform
those worlds in reality 

Not fearing the seas
the sailors follow up
a quest of adventures
a new land in sight
a power divine
another dimension

Now the know
the force of Gods
that leads the way to heaven
as time goes by
they know they'll find
The hidden gate to glory

But not all Gods were on their side
The fear of Baco was the power
that those men could achieve
they were successful on their fight
not even storms could ever stop
what the concilium decides
