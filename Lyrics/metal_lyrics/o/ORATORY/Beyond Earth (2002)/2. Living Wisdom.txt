Looking for...a new sign unknown
keeping our hopes from the world
asking for...answes all along
time remains in (the) time to come

And now! We came so far
and for us this is just
a question of war

I am urging to find more
from the lost land I adore
I am chosen to go there
from ancient times and everywhere

Looking for...other coloured lands
finding how the world expands
asking...what we might find

Sure it will be on
