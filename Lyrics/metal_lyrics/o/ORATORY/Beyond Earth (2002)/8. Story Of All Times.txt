Once you love a
force in all hearts
could cause this pain
a story of all times 

The prince should have known
she wasn't his queen
but he didn't care
love was not a sin

Even if his father didn't like
what he felt was much stronger than life

Near the river found their love
forbidden and secret
I believe it lived forever

He could hear the sound of her voice
dying for his love
the King's choice

Peter crying tears for Agnes
revenge will be done
cruelty

The prince's heart turned cold amd sad
she became Queen after death

Near the river found their love
forbidden and secret
I believe it lived forever
The tears running from His eyes
forever He will cry
and I believe they met in heaven

He became a cruel King
His heart was empt without love
