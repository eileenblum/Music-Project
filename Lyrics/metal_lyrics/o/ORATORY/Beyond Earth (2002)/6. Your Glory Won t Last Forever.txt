The sun was gone
dark was the sea
and they feared for their lives
they could not believe their eyes

An enormous sight
appear to them
rising mightly in the air
they really felt despair

Gama's sailors praying to their God
looking at that vision
they travelled into the unkown sea
their quest and their mission

Who are you to wake me up?
from whaich land did you come?

Your glory won't last forever

There's no meaning to your life
I'll destroy you with delight

Your glory won't last forever

The skies were gone
dark was the sea
and they feared for their lives
they could not believe their eyes

A monstrous sight
appeared to them
rising mightly in the air
they really felt despair
