In virgin seas they salied in search of land
despite fear they bravely found a new world

Where the mysteries of the glorious nature
are silently kept by myths

for a world
where we don't fear our Gods
we coud die, to make our people pray
for a world
where we don't fear the unknown
we could try, try to fly far away

But now we have nothing left
Only pride, the pride in our distant past

A legacy from the brave sailors who ruled

The wonders of the deepest seas
