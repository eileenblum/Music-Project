There was a land over the sea
cradle of poets it would be

And then a storm of descoveries for all;
To rise and never (to) fail

We are proud to say we're the legacy!
we keep the flame through eternity
we'll be guardions of a new birth
and keep discovering beyond earth

We saw new worlds with their eyes
there's no more pain; there's no more lies

And now a storm of descoveries for all;
we hear the ancient call
