Sailing right through the skies
we're gonna fly higher
in search of peace and freedom
a new quest waits for us
adventures and glory
a new world to live in

Storming days full of darkness in our hearts
we need a better faith

Against time we are running to avoid
the end of human life
We'll search the Universe
a new empire we'll raise

Once again, a great journey we'll start
ahead to the unkown

The universe is calling for us
peacful worlds are waiting
we'll sail to the Universe
a new empire we'll raise

Fearless sailors are riding to the sky
a new Eden they'll find

The end of darkness will be getting close
the sun will shine again
we'll rule the universe
a new empire we'll raise

"QuÃ£o doce Ã© o louvor e a justa glÃ³ria
Dos prÃ³prios feitos, quando sÃ£o soados!
Qualquer nobre batalha que em memÃ³ria
venÃ§a ou iguale os grandes jÃ¡ passados;

AS enjevas da ilustre e alheia histÃ³ria
fazem mil feitos sublimados
Quem valerosas obras exercita,
Louvor alheio muito o esperta e incita"
[A portuguese poem by Luis de Camoes.
English translation:
How sweet is the praise and righteous glory
From our own deeds, when they are sounded!
Any noble battle in which memory
beats or equals the great that have passed.

The envy of illustrious and foreign history
make a thousand deeds sublimate
Him who valuable doings exercises,
Foreign praise arouses and incites]
