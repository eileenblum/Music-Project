And so they were departured
watching an even smaller land

A tragic old man, speaking words of doom
while fear arise among a listening crowd...

Brave people beware! Fate holds for our quest
behold the dangers and sorrows so near
brave people beware! Fate holds for our quest
but the divine army does not care

In search for the unkown firmly crossing the seas!
victory won't come

Old man's prophecy would never occur
in an already sentenced destiny
In secrets of the seas achieve
power beyond belief!
