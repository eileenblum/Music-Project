Now I know that I will live forever
And I know that I ain't gonna die

I hold the flag in my hands
and in my heart
the wish to hold her up and high

I will sail oceans of time
knowing that I've crossed
the doors to a new world
I know what the future is
and I know that I will be eternal

Now the world we see is getting smaller
and the seas won't be a mystery

You'll hold the flag in your hands
And in your heart
the wish to her up and high
