We live this together
We're Bounder by sound
All these years of struggle
Are keeping us strong

We reach for each other's smile
We're playing with the same mind
We know that we'll be together
Through out time

We're living a dream
And we know
It's part of our lives
This kind of sound
There's no way to hide
What we own
We'll always be here
As one

The force of this bounding
Goes on trough the years
A look in the eyes
Can mean more than the words

We reach for each other's smile
We're playing with the same mind
We know that we'll be together
Through out time
