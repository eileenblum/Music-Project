There was a land over the sea
Cradle of poets it would be

And then a storm of descoveries for all;
To rise and never (to) fail

We are proud to say we're the legacy!
We keep the flame through eternity
We'll be guardions of a new birth
And keep discovering beyond earth

We saw new worlds with their eyes
There's no more pain; there's no more lies

And now a storm of descoveries for all;
We hear the ancient call
