[Live in S.Pedro do Sul - 2004]

They saw and island appearing through the fog
Divine women were waiting on the shore

We're divine poets rhyme
We are the healing for your hearts
And we'll take you to paradise

Along the night we are the magic sight
Catching the souls in desire
Senses are high
The flesh will burn in fire
The wind will blow a song of lust

Gods were ssing all this orgy of love
The brave sailors under the power above

We're divine poets rhyme
Flowers that blossom in your hands
And we'll take you to paradise

Now you know the way
The path to paradise

You see yourself almost a God
