[Live in Paradise Garage - 2000]

Land of creation
More than a place
It's like a spirit
That has been living through our times
Home of the warriors
Fighting for people's freedom
A magic place that never dies

Miracle of Gods
Through dimensions
May it be the one that's higher?
Never been defeated
It's majestic Queen of power
The one
The rising Land
