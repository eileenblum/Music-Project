We don't know what we are
What we think and what we see
We're trying to find ourselves
Living the right way
We should know what we are
What we think and what we see
In a world-a world of illusions

[chorus]

We're trying to find ourselves
And learn to live   

[bridge]

Nothing to be, ntohing to think
And nothing to see
Could this be the world we want

Some people think that we're lost
But we have to learn with mistakes
So you have to see
What's the world we live in
You may think that we're lost
So you'll have to find your way
In a world-a world of illusion

[chorus]
