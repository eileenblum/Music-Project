He came from the Iron Age
In another dimension
He came to Earth
To pray his believes
"It's fantasy or reality?"

The answer to this question
We know the only truth
But sometimes it's forgotten
We are the reality
The warrior's fantasy 
And we must be strong and fight!

With Glory and Melory he arrived
Coming from the land of fantasy
With Glory and Melody
The warrior came to saty
To keep on the sacred metal way
