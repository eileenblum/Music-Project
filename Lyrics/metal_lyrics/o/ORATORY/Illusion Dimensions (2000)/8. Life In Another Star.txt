They came from deep space
From the land we never saw
They are a starnge race
And we expect them to save our souls 
They said there is so many
Life out there
That some it will cross your lands
And send me a sign of life 

We have to wait for the light in the dark
A real sign about the big question-UFO.
'cause we believe that there is
LIfe in another star
Life in many stars
