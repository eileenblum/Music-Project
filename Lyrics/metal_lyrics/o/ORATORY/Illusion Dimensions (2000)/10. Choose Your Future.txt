walking over the abyss
With angels by my side
I can't see 'cause I'm blind
Although there's nothing else to see

[chorus]

Give me wings to fly away
We must stop; it's the end of the world

[bridge]

How good could it be
All people living in peace
No more wars around us
And misery, don't you see?

[chorus]

let them die, that's not my problem
Who cares? (I don't care!)
Maybe one day if you regret
It will be too late

But it's up to you
Why do you make it so hard?
You have the destiny in your hands
Use it to save the human race

Walking over the abyss
With angels by my side
No more wars around us
And misery, don't you see?

[chorus]
