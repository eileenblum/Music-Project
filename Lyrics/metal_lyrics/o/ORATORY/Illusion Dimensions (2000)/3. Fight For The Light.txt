I'm sited on star, full of light and magic
From here i can see the earth
I'm sited on a star, it looks so small and feeble
Like a litle child at his birth
When we look at the sky we see the stars
Shining upon the horizon

[chorus]

Fight for the light
Fight for the bright day
Fight for the glorious light

I'm sited on a star, among all planets
Above you I see a dark shade
I'm sited on star, I pray and hope
That your light will never fade
When we look at the sky
WE see stars
Shining upon the horizon

[chorus]
