He found fate in his way
The only cause he fought for
He discovered the only thing
To loose his life

In the wild land of trees
Rivers and stories
Tell the believers to be afraid
Once upon a time
A story has been told
It recalls life itself. About dreams
Glory...
A quest for glory
A world...
Where skies are blue

He fought with his heart
Agaiinst spells and sorceress
A brave man he is
Fighting for destiny
