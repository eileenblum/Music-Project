In the beginning of times
Appeared a mysterious messanger
Nobody knew from where he came or
What he would bring to them
He brought a new awakening
A symphony in their hearts
A melody never heard again
But never turned apart

[chorus]

You gave us the light
You brought us the strength to keep on
This fight
Metal messanger
You gave us the light
You brought us the strength to keep on
This quest and fight

When he went to the unknown
He left a kingdom in harmony
A hymn of enchanted sounds
And a new song as born
He brought a new awakening
A symphony for the hearts
A melody never heard again
But never turned apart

[chorus]
