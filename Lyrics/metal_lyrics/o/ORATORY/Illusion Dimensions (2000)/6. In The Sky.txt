The saddest story
Happened in the ancient times
Moon wasn't the same, we know

The brightest star, that the sky
Had ever seen
She was the brightest star, that the sky
had ever seen

The moments they had
Won't ever be forgotten
In the sky
She won't see the Sun again

That's why she's sad and lonely
In the sky
She lights the path of lovers
In the night, remembering

Fire and Moonlight
Will never be together
The prophecy took lovers apart
