I am the pain you seek,
I see through destiny
I am the eyes that bleed,
From this disharmony
I am the air you breathe,
Reborn in jealousy
Your blinded eyes can't see,
I am your misery

Reality...insanity...born in disease
Tears they create...lives they destroy...internal voids
Eternity...in suffering...reaping the seams
Souls start to burn...inside of me...through broken dreams

Drowning inside of dreams,
Hide insecurities
The life you bury deep,
So drawn to disbelief
I am the dark caress,
Inside the emptiness
Savior of innocence,
Victims of life's regrets
