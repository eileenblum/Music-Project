Bury the light,
To blacken your soul
Liars in wait,
Feeling so cold

In malice I breathe,
Through blindness I see

Valleys of life,
Pleasure in pain
Beauty once loved,
Cast down in flames

In malice I breathe,
Through blindness I see
In malice I breathe,
I conquer your dreams

Feel my vengeance,
Cast upon thee
Ride the serpents,
Of never ending...fear

Fields of rage,
Swallow your mind
Life swept away,
By the divine
