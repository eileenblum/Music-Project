Beyond the gates of emptiness, no one shall escape
A dying world left to rot in lust, incest, and rape
A sworn pact made in blood, the seed now grows inside
An Autumn breeze now turns to frost, frozen winds now cry

Her memories are scarred for life, her face is stained by tears
Fantasies now turn to black upon this throne of fear
A worthless life that caused this pain, my angers now arise
You worthless fuck, you waste of life, your ways that I despise

Hatred breeding hatred...In my Corrosion
Beauty bleeding darkness...Through soul erosion
Faceless bodies burning...In my Corrosion

Eroded thoughts fill the mind, never to betray
Voices of the unknown ones crying to be saved
Shattered feelings of the past, burning deep inside
Unforgiving, unrelenting shadows that you hide
