Look into the skies,
Take apart your mind
As I close my eyes,
See creation die
Seek this hallowed land,
Always to destroy
Like a grain of sand,
Pain will now rejoice

Listen to screams,
Of blood soaked misery
Sorrow breeding fear,
Inside the enemy
Tortured by the hand,
Upon our destiny
Look into your face,
Tell me what you see
Through their eyes,
Through their eyes

Search for blinded faith,
It burns so many ways
Never to escape,
Sorrow's warm embrace

Never to betray,
Voices deep Inside
Hearts and minds that bleed,
Promised only lies
