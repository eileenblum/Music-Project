All I see...suffering,
Let them die...selfishly
Spineless fools...under me,
Torn apart...beyond belief
Nature's cries...deafening,
Paradise...mocking me
Backs turned to...humanity,
Never mend...worlds to be

Upon the Uncreation

Lies...bleeding my mind,
Sorrow...laughing inside
Vision...blinded by the light
Inside rage...therapy,
They break down...self esteem
A world of...impurity,
Kill the want...for the need
Loss of life...sickens me,
Freedom's loss...eyes to see
Lost in greed...continually,
Try to change...memories

Worthless fools...to misguide,
Nevermind...other's lives
Animals...meet demise,
Because our two...worlds collide
