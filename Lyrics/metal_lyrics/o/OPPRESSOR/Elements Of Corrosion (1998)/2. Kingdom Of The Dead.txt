Hearing the voice of a thousand lies
Blindness is vision through a thousand eyes
Portal to dimensions of distant cries...cries

Bodies burning, selfish yearning lust for flesh
An undiscovered spiritual journey of bloodshed

Welcome...To the kingdom...Of the dead

Through this darkness ancient evils now arise
Into the veins of creation they now writhe

Suffer...withing the passion of the hatred that you breed
Rejoice...upon the fields of the sorrow that you breathe
Bastards...of the creation through the whores that they are born
Never...seem to feel the pain of lives which they deform
