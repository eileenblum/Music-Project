Like an ever flowing stream,
Like an everlasting dream
Twist the knife you bury deep,
It's the nature of the beast
Like a pane of shattered glass,
Like a fire turned to ash
You never took pity,
You never wanted them
You never wanted them,
You never wanted them
You only gave them pain,
You only gave them pain

Blinded

You took all you could,
Your truth was only lies
No one could save you, from your selfish vanity
A pain that never mends,
A fever inside of them
Why can you not feel,
These burning lives

Blinded

You...Make me hate, You...Make me hate
You...Make me hate, You...Make me hate

Object of all temptation
Cannot feel rejection
Paved a way to bleeding hearts
Through the flesh one last time
Like an ever flowing stream
Like an everlasting dream
Twist the knife you bury deep
It's the nature of the beast

Blinded

You...Make me hate,
You...Make me hate
You...Make me hate,
You...Make me hate
