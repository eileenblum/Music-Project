[Chorus]
Eve of Mourn
Sickness forms...seasons
Beauty gone
Sadness spawns...seasons

Sorrow, in and out of the point of pain
Reborn,by the way of thoughts gained
Helpless,searching for the answer to death
Dying,waiting for the last breath
Deformed,deformed lives

Unspoken words of a worthless cause,lust is disguised
Forgotten ones scream in pain,lost in demise
Whispers carry through the winds,to hide their shattered lives

Wither and die

[Bridge]
Decieved by the belief in hope
Bow down before the fate of all

Sea of bliss,wave of conscious all drowning
How could i be so blind
