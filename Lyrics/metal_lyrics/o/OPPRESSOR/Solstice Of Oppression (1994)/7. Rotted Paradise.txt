Suffer

Torn by betrayal
Beaten and used
Ingest your morals
As the innocent are fucked against their will

The truth it haunts me
Sublimination
Seeing is believing
But its your blindness that still prevails

Your greed and your power,tools of the trade
When sadness is pleasure
Its your existence that i deny

Erosion to fill the mind
Pray for an afterlife
Life that will scar the soul
Lost all fucking hope
Harvest of misery
Starving a selfish plea
Shadows of dreams now past
A nightmare soon fills your eyes

Denouncing the saviour,in murderous ways
A perverted devotion
Cleansed by the acid of denial,embraced by incest
In pleasures of flesh
Abort the bastard
Caused by your father,a man to hate
Death in resentment,a hybrid of sin
Away with the morals,as your fears are me in disguise

Rotted Paradise
