Darkness,internal
Lost souls,helpless cries
Insanity,a dream
The path to death is free
Endless torment of battered feelings

Morbid thoughts elude the brain
Voices persist in rage
Alone inside a world of pain
Lost within the mind
Confined in an array of fear
Memories fade away
Mental powers under siege
As i lay dying inside

Nightmares,haunting
Mentality restrained
Confliction imprisons
The beast inside me
Memories fade the hate
Of thoughts once known

Dying inside
