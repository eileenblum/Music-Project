Internal death sentence is made
Eaten from within
Medical science has failed
Try to carve it out
Innocent children will die
Never lived their lives
Fears of the past arise
Still there is no cure

Blood soaked in misery
Dying in agony
Atarting to eat away
There is no way to breathe
Death is the destiny
Gutted in ecstasy
Forced into lunacy
Awaiting the final day
Devour the soul
disease has taken control

Unsuspecting victims of fate
Vomit up your blood
Half eaten innards decay
Soon infection spreads
Only will to live retained
Eyes that glow in doom
All internal organs are gone
Take your final breath
