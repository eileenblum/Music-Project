Raped of virtue,led to betrayal
Darkness summoned,vows to renew

Age of blackened hearts
When darkness once resigned
Memories of dreams past
Torn by the nether world
Tears drowning your face
As the saviour comes
And the angels fell to the suffering

Led by the lies of disharmony
Starving the soul with lifes agony
Demons have risen to summon the dead
Riding the world of humanity
Taking the dreams of life swept away
Memories once known are lost in dismay
A hybrid of sorrow,pain and despair
Lost of a hope that is too late to save

Age of blackened hearts
When darkness once resigned 
Memories of dreams past
Torn by the nether world

Tears drowning your face,as the saviour comes
Lost in your disgrace,life it has swept away

Blood to water
Bathe in desire
Love is beckoned
But hate has come
