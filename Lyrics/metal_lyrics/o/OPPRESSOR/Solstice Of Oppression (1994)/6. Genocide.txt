Mass extermination...genocide
Racial elimination...they decide
Corpses were to cremate
Living were to suffocate

The terror from within
when expectancy is death
The fear of knowing when life ends
The fate is in their hands

Enter the realm of the genoicidal holocaust
Come to a time when children were born to fear
Enter the ashes of the genocidal holocaust
When extermination left no cries to hear

Hear...the cries

Abolish slavery,engage in death
Gas fills the air,take your last breath
Incinerated bodies a mile high
Women and children,they were forced to die

Amputation of the limbs
Mortification soon sets in
Millions of people betrayed by lies
Time to kiss your lives goodbye

Decimate the Unborn...kill
Experiment on anyone...transplants
genetic reconstruction
The will to live has gone

A living hell on earth
A sworn pact made in blood to destroy
The discovery was absurd
A monstrosity to the world
