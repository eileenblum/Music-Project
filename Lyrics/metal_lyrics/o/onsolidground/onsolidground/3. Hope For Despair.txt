There will come a time when those who do not believe will become the damned
There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
Complete agony in place of peace
The world will fall and all that's left will be laid to waste

There will be no turning back
This is the end
The great division of our time

Yet in this time of despair there is hope left
Turn your heart to Christ, He will set you free
His love will wash away your tears and your pain

By His stripes we are healed
We are made complete through Him
