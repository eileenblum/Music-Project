HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS!

Cant you see that filth and disgust lie on your every word?
Bound by remorse and infidelity
There is no honor in what you do

The deceptions and the lies ensnaring and entrapping you
Unable to breathe

I cant imagine the pain, the misery it must bring to you every night
And to think that all of this could end with one simple plea for forgiveness
But you chose the path of destruction
