Lets put the past behind us
And become the better man

This is not the time to waste our time
So lets take these words and put them to good use
Set the example instead of pointing the finger to judge
Why not love our neighbor as ourselves
We say we live for God, lets act like it

Were so concerned with other people and what they have to say
This is your life, you live it once
Make the best of it
