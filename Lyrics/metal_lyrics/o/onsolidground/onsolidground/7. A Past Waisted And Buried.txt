Why do I put up with this?
I ask for love, you steal my heart
Well take all the chances you can get
It wont happen again, ill make sure of that

And don't even think that you can come back
You dug your grave, now lie in it

All these twists and turns
You think this is a game?
Ill sit this one out
Just say you hate me that would make things easier than they already are
It would save me the time of buying roses for your funeral

Just don't cry wolf a third time
I wont be there to hear you scream
