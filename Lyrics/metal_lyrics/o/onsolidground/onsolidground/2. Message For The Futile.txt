All eyes open now, there's nothing to hide
Is this another lie, or have you swallowed your pride
When will this ignorance be put to rest?
When your left to die and all else fades, what then will you do when there is nothing left?
Your plea for mercy will not be heard

The cries of the damned will rise to the ear of our Lord
Depart from me for I never knew you are the words which you will hear
And so the reign of terror begins

I've said this before, Ill say it again
You will receive your reward

The time we have is petty
Death lurks just around the corner
So stand and make your decision
The decision of a life time
