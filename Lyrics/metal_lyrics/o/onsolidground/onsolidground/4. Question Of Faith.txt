For so long you have not seen the light of day
Blinded by a darkness that consumes all things
You were left to die, to rot
But that was not his plan
Our God the creator of life
He gave you light
He offers his hands to pull you from the flames

If only you would give him your life
He made such a sacrifice for so little a thing
If you were asked to die, would you give your life?
Where do you stand now?
Is it not enough to believe,
A wooden cross stained red with the blood of the lamb?
Maybe you'll see now that there is much more to this picture than you know
A life had to be given to save your own
