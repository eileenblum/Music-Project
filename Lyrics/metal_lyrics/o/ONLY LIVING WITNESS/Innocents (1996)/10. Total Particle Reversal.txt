I recognize what I hear in your voice
In the cold, through the lines
I recognize the secular fire
I want to take us away

We're nothing more than animate flesh
We're nothing more than animate
Time ends when I say
You come to me, you come to me my way
It's up to me who comes with me my way

This is nothing that was preordained
But as the whole thing culminates
Along the lines of the determinist mind
There are answers, and reasons, and purposeful conclusions
