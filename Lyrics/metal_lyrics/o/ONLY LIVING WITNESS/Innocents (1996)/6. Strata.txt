...All my heroes, they let me down
'Cause they're not the same no more
All my hereos they let me down
And I'm no the same no more
When I said I prayed I'd die before you
I meant in front of
Back to ruin, back to ruin
Disappointment came to me
Disappointment came to mean
Improve on an example or it could bring me back to ruin...
