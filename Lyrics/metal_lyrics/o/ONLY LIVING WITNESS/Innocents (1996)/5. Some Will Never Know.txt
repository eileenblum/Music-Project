We all alone held on to hands now sallowed
read in align, with arms all out to open eyes
You consider me, oh so reactionary
But see, all I know is we all began below
The nature of the being is naught to follow, no one to read
How humane this He became?
He incite, and He deny, but He all pain from whence it came
We alight, borne aloft
Pariah aflame

I but that time behind
He come and He defy
I put that behind, what a lie
