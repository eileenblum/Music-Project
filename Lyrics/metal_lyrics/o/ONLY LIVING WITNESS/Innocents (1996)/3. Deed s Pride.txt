No pride in what I didn't create
No pride in what I didn't make happen
Notions posed of them and those
But not what pain came to man for

Moments pass mine eyes in a light construed as righteous
I question, is it a true fight?

Consequence was telling more back then
With that destiny that never manifested
All this backwards thought's still left
But "be just and fear not"
I have kept
