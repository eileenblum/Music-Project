Had I known, Hell I knew
What time was gone when mother left you
As with dawn, grey skies more
See the lies Delilah wore
I don't know what the cause
I only know what was
Hesitation, self-loathing
Never brought the mountains to the lonely
I wanted skies more, always skies more
I cannot disguise or hide behind the need to know
Before me stood the once believed eternal
We stayed silent, my breath stolen
Until my eyes tripped down
Their backlit shapes to the flow
The water flow that carries them away
