Still, they will define burdens of empire by the moral decline
We've been deaf in the middle of a downpour

Naiive to have ever thought that anything could be done
Now everything is lost
Everything is lost

(The) abstinent imperative is not so real
As to alter base self stealth itself
How much longer is it going to get worse before it gets better?
