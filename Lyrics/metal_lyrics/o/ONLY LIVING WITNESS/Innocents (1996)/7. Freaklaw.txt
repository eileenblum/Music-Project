Freaklaw made the trust in me
Freaklaw surrounds
It made some I know believe in some kick made right
By the side with the might, mystique
And some freak made law that said it's all one could ever need
Freaklaw came back red-blooded
A second lesson put me in another light
Freaklaw's been long since bettered
With time I might rely too freely

Don't want to have to steal to get what's mine by right
