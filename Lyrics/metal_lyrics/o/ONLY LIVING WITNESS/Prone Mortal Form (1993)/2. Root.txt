[Jenkins/Crowley]

Long before the siege us lifted
See that more than men were felled
The desolate expanse the victor
The conqueror, the void, the well

Life had slithered forth from it
The actual antagonist
In every battle fought against
Apparent need for quieting and

The victor's exultant moment
Adrenaline flow fleeting
Human agony's no the answer
So why is it in the plan?

Life had slithered forth from it
The actual antagonist
In every battle fought against
Apparent need for quieting
And lifelessness

The victor's exultant moment
Adrenaline flow fleeting
Human agony's no the answer
So why is it in the plan?
