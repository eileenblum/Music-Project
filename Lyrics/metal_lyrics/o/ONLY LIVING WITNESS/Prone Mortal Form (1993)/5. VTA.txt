[Jenkins/Stevenson]

Bullets in the bathroom wall
Are more a sign of putting up
Than giving into anything
You'd think of giving in to
Say you saw it coming on
Well show us how it comes to
A blaming hand
A solemn end
A sort of sense
An empty chamber

Oh he will provide

Greater man
Have fallen victim, have fallen victim
A fallen victim
There lies
A fallen victim
A fallen victim
A fallen victim

Mirrors in a pool of sanguine
