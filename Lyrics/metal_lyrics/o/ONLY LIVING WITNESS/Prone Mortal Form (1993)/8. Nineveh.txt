[Jenkins/Stevenson/Silverman]

Come hither in a weakened state
In my name you're bound to make some enemies
Score and one behind me
With (a) child's eyes I regard his story
Shall prohibit interaction
As the wondrous world, the wondrous world
The world collapses

Know me hear me hate me Nineveh

A panacea, human hope
Frantic fiction prevaricope
Exclusionary, narrow scope
Invented in isolation
Erstwhile it was geographic
The incontinence of Ecclesiastics
Simply just is not a fact in
The eyes of a man that has someone
Someone to save him

Know me hear me hate me Nineveh

Save them, give your everything
Except attention to the inconsistencies
Complete with deceit
Go ahead and try to will me away
