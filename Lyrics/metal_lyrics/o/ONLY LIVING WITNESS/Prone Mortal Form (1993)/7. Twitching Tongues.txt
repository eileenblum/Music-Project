[Jenkins/Stevenson/Silverman]

Responsibility vile for those who'll accept it
Follow one, follow another,
Tongue in wisdom
A certain kind lives to be directed
Will you be the one to clutch the jaws
And grab and rip them
And now you say
Twitching tongues
Twitch in tongues
Twitch in tongues aloud he doublespake

Built with all the fallen forms
Composting pile of viscous warm
Getting older, cemented over
Sickening, salted, suited soldier

Washing tons of decay away
(I'm) picking out me piece today
Eliminate the words they say
Twitching tougues on shiny trays
