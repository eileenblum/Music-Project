Just breathe
This world is crashing down on me
And I don't know if I can take anymore
Come forth and help me understand this meaning
The visions have been erased
I need to long for so much more
Can I make it through this trial?
Will I make it through this war?
Where do all these creatures come from in the shadows?
Where do they find their shapes?
I have nowhere to run I will not be their prey
I have nowhere to run I will not be their prey
I need something louder than a whisper
To disown the ways of the weak
I know it's hard to make sense
When I don't even know if I believe in myself
So many tough questions to answer
Please tell me I'm not alone
I have nowhere to run I will not be their prey
I need something louder than a whisper
To disown the ways of the weak
The ways of the weak
I know it's hard to make sense
When I don't even know If I believe in myself
So many tough questions to answer
I know now I'm not alone
