Do you not see this proof you're attempting will never go far?
Attached to these wires feeding lies to the innocent
This all follows a path to an ambush
Results of leading to constant searching
I feel the weight of my lungs collapse
I'm tired of breathing this pollution
And staying blinded by the smoke
There must be another way out
Take your release and try something new
And let the indicator show you
What it also feels
What is the meaning of second chances?
Whatever happened to this heart?
Help me restore what is left
There is no vanishing in fear
The end will not take me
Reconstruction is here
Take your release and try something new
And let the indicator show you
what it also feels to believe
To believe this
What else do I need to know?
Take your release
And let the indicator show you
