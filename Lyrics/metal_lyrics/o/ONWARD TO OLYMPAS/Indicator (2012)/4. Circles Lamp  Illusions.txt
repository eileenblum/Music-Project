I need you to take me somewhere that I long to be
Because I know that I am letting this whole place get to me
I'm so sick of letting myself fall into this weakness
And all of these things keep circling through my head

I know that something is going wrong here
And I hope that it's an illusion

What we need
What we need is a narrow escape
What we need is something to take hold onto

You know you still live your life in the past
When you cannot accept what is left to change
I know it's time to break through this and be remade

What we need
What we need is...

What we need
What we need is a narrow escape
What we need is something to take hold onto

When you look me in the eyes
It's then you realize
It's then you realize
I'm not the person I once was
You need to quit comparing me to the past
Our time has passed
This is nothing to me

I can't rely on my own strength
Release yourself
Release yourself to the one who can save you now
