You were never betrayed
Quit making all these excuses and getting yourself out of line
Another piece is broken out of this puzzle that you call time
Don't you think you're the strong man now
When you questioned who I am
When you didn't even know if you could find these answers for yourself
I will never, no I will never be apart of this system
Dead end paths, stay in the word
You have to rid yourself of this world
There's nothing for us in this machine
Watch yourself, watch your actions before they come off wrong
Your security can't keep everyone out
I can't believe all those things you self proclaimed
How many times does it go through your head?
You know I can't see through this
I'm looking for these answers I can't seem to find
Can't you see my world is struggling?
Who do you think you are?
I won't let you walk over me
It's time to prove everyone wrong
Dead end paths, stay in the word
You have to rid yourself of this world
There's nothing for us in this machine
