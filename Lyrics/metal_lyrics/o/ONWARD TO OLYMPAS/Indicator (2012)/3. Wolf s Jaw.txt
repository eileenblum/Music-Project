I can feel this cold wind rush over me
My eyes aren't adjusted to this dark place
Some part of me can feel
The devil's hands wrapped around my throat

Why am I drenched in sweat?
My nerves are shaking like the walls
All eyes look down on me
Waiting to accept the wrong

When the mist clears up
I can clearly see how frail you are

Fearing my voice you tremble in terror
What kind of concept are you using, using
To take over my mind?

You forgot to realise
I'm too strong even for my own good
I will always overcome

Now shy away and disappear, and disappear
But I know it won't stay gone for long

You know how to make me feel
Like I'm walking down a terrible path
But I know I have the right intentions

When the mist clears up
I can clearly see how frail you are
Fearing my voice you tremble in terror

What kind of concept are you using, using
To take over my mind?

Open your closed mind
Quit letting these jaws hold you down
I know it's a sign
You're headed towards the right way
Don't believe the lies

These so called people feed you
I will not confide with all the words they say
Don't let it take you down
Don't let it take you down
Don't let your heart sink with heavy burdens

When the mist clears up
I can clearly see how frail you are
Fearing my voice you tremble in terror
What kind of concept are you using, using
To take over my mind?

Open your mind
