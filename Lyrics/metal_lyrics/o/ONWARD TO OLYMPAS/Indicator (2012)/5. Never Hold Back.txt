I will not be broke in pieces
My reflections don't belong on the ground
When there's nowhere left to go but forward
This time we'll never hold back
Why don't we listen to each other on this one
Why can't you take the step and move on
You're not the same to me, you can't obey yourself
And I've had enough
Will I ever stop running in this race?
After seeing nothing but the breaks
Maybe it's the late drives that cause my mind to rush with thoughts
The sort of thoughts that always cause me to wonder
The ones that always try to take me down
You might have thought that I lost all my control
This time around
and gave your everything to have me planted in the ground
I will be stronger than my enemies
Where were you when I thought I lost it all?
Where was the answer when I was missing?
I've understood it was in my reach all this time
Why was I ignoring?
I'm unsure how I was claiming to push forward
I look back and release this all
Watching everything I kept in slowly drift away
I won't be a part of this
Who did I think I was?
The past will not partner with the outcome of your future
We finally listened to each other on this one
I have taken the step to move on
I'm not the same you see, I need to stay on track
And I never held back
