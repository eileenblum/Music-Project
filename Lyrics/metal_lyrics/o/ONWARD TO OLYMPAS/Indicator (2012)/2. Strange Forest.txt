Get me away from here
I don't think I can take these voices anymore
The same ones that you've heard for so long
Do you feel the distress as you take on being sick?
Where are you running?
Where will you go?
Don't bury yourself alive
and cower under these fearful ways
If time is of the essence
I pray that it comes fast
I know I lacked my faith
In the toughest era yet
Just help me plan to carry
What breaks upon my chest
All in with the strength of the maker
This is knocking at your door
Quit pulling what you can't handle
Pulling so long the trees will grow weak
If time is of the essence
I pray that it comes fast
I know I lacked my faith
In the toughest era yet
All of these branches are breaking
But it still sticks to the roots
Staying buried in this firm foundation
Wash away the dirt that covers me
Pull me from the filth I lie beneath
I will follow what you need me to be
