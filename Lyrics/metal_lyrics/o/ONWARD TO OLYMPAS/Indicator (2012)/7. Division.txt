You can run, but won't get far
Because I have run
Always ignoring as things got harder
You know, nothing changes until you want
This world hates me
Do you know the feeling of being despised?
So I sit back and close my eyes
God let the boldness shine through me
So come on, come on, come on
I know it's not that easy
Just step over that wall of division
And come to Me
I'm walking in the dark, can you see me&gt;
So come on, come on, come on
I know it's not that easy
With outstretched arms, I'm drowning
So I reach out for guidance to pull me through the storm
I'm done with keeping my head buried
No more sleeping with my eyes wide
So come on, come on, come one
I know it's not that easy
Just step over that wall of division
And come to Me
I'm walking in the dark, can you see me?
So come on, come on, come on
I know it's not that easy
With outstretched arms, I'm drowning
This world hates me
Do you know the feeling of being despised?
So I sit back and close my eyes
