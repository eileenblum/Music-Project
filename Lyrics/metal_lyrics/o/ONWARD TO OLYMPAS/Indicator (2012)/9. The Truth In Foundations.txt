Do you even know who I am?
Like you know what the word change is
If only you could focus on looking into your own eyes
They would bleed, they would bleed in hope for a remedy
In sights of things that are taking place
I am aware this disgusts me
I know you would feel the same
This is the part that is over
And nothing old will remain
There is no way to repay what is already done
Fiction's only a word when you lie to the sun
Do not believe what your mind keeps telling you
You are not your own, you are not your own
You were just left broken and all alone
You had me thinking I was crushed
By this foundation I had with another
Until I realized the subject I did not desire
If this is not what it is
And never meant to be
There is no need to suffer
I need you to tell me it's over
I need you to tell me it's over
I need you to tell me it's over
Tell me it's over
There is no way to repay what is already done
Fiction is only a word when you lie to the sun
Do not believe what your mind keeps telling you
You are not your own, you are not your own
I'm so sick of your face
Can you quit playing the victim?
What is it you've known?
You are a fake, a coward
There is no way to repay what is already done
Fiction is only a word when you lie to the sun
Do not believe what your mind keeps telling you
You are not your own, you are not your own
