All you said was all for nothingYour lies, the betrayalI believed as the truthNow the wool has been removed And now I see you for who you areAnd now I see you for who you are I pour my heart out in declarationThis is the endI have buried your memory Time was so truly wasted you were a dream to meTime was so truly wasted you were a dream to me Surely we will not fall for your trapWhen you return to save this placeWe will fight to see you failWe will fight to see you fail
