I'm Breathless
I can't speak at all
When I think of myself exactly like eveyone else
In our lives we get told who we are
This world is full of judgement

Whoa if only you had known
If you had known
That this wolrd is not your home
Is not your home

I will not let you affect my life
I'm tired of living in your ways
I will stand tall and stay tall
But I will take this challenge
And make something of myself

Whoa if only you had known
If you had known
That this wolrd is not your home
Is not your home
Whoa if only you had known
If only you had known

This world is not my home
I'm only here to send the message
This world is not my home
I live behind the gates
This world is not my home

Say what you will but I'll still be standing
Safe and secure undeservingly pure you found me
Ignored your call I loss it all your grace abounding
Giver of life guide me home
(Guide me home)
