There is not a day that I don't think of you
Everyday I cry and ask why oh why
I watched you suffer day to day

Will you come down and help me through this
You are the light that will lead my way
Show me 
Show me the way

Day to day, but your spirits stayed high
Even though you were dying inside
As that evil sickness ate at you
The grace and your fate were relieved
Because you believed

Will you come down and help me through this
You are the light that will lead my way
Show me 
Show me the way

Not how he died
But how he lived
Not what he did
But what he gave
Nobody can measure up to his worth as a man
He was ready with word and cheer
To bring the smiles to banish those tears
After all he did
I was his hero
That is what he said to me
But he was the one who guided me

Your presence was there at the funeral
But you live on in my spirit and heart
In my spirit and heart

Will you come down and help me through this
Will you come

[Solo]

Will you come down and help me through this
You are the light
That will lead the way to me
Show me the way
