You're such an inspiration for all the things
That I would never choose to be I'd sell my self to believe
That you could of loved someone like you did me
Or maybe to just let you know of the mess you made
But then you left behind, I pray for the one
That left me broken down and paralyzed
You left me broken down
I did it for you

If only you would know I did it all for you [x2]
All for you

I did it all for you, more than friends we never had to be
I did it all for you
Because I was such a fool to think that I

That I could never make you see
All the hope I had, as the broken glass cuts through me
I gasp to get the air [x3]

Desperate only looking for a way to go
Reasons no one knows, hiding all the hurtful feelings inside
Desperate looking for a way to go
Reasons no one knows
Hiding all the hurtful feelings inside
Hurt as the blood cries.
