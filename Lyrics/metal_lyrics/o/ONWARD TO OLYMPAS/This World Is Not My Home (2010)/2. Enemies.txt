All hell breaks looseFor one reason onlyTo try to destroy me and my ways of trying to save Battered and Burised I standDone by the work of your handsBut if you open up your eyes to seeThat you will never defeat meI will stand my ground defeat any boundries so try and give everything you have So choke on your wordsCause nothing you sayCan destroy my God(Nothing you say) Battered and Burised I standDone by the work of your handsBut if you open up your eyes to seeThat you will never defeat me I will stand my ground defeat any boundries so try and give everything you have [x2] But if you open up your eyes to see(Open you eyes)That you will never defeat me I watched you try to take us downI watched you try to take us down But you can't bring us down(You can't bring us down)But you can't bring us down(You can't bring us down)
