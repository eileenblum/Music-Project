You try to stop me from doing everything that I'm called to do
But I will rip you out of my mind and throw you to the ground
You are leading this God-free youth and you are calling everyone to death

You will cause them all to burn but I will do my best
And stand side by side with the One who died to stop all of this

Bring forth the masses
Bring forth the masses

Stand side by side with the One who died for me

Continually, continually you try to pull me down
It used to be when it came to me I'd go without a sound
But there was change in my life

You tried to stop me but you have yet to realize that I'm unstoppable
You can give all that you have but you will never bring me down
I hope you know that you are wasting your time
Send everything and bring all that you have
But when I'm standing side by side with the One who died for me
We can save this world
We can save this world

Save us, bring everyone home
Save us, bring everyone home
Save us, bring everyone home
Save us, bring everyone home

Let's stop, start all over, we'll live in freedom and we'll all be saved
Let's stop, start all over, we'll live in freedom and we'll all be saved
Let's stop, start all over, we'll live in freedom and we'll all be saved
Let's stop, start all over, we'll live in freedom and we'll all be saved
