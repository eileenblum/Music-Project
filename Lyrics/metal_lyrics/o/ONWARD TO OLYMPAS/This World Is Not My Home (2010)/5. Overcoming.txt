So many things hit all at once
So much confusion

For one to handle
I try to explain myself but
No one seems to understand

What have I become

Becoming another in this filthy world

What have I become
Becoming just like you
What do I do with my life
Will I make it through
In fact I know I will just give me a chance to show you

I watched you to try to find the answers
But you can't handle
You can't handle the truth

He is there for me
And there were times that I didn't believe

But he still loves me.
