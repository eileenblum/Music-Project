I know you're mad at every possible thing
That's what gives you so much hate
I know we all aren't perfect in this world
But why have you chose to act like this
You think it's right to be evil inside
But let me tell you something

Wake up you're not that tough 
(Wake up)
Believe me this is how it should be 
(This is how it should be)

How it should be

But soon we will all go home
Just give me a chance to show you the way
My words can be an inspiration
Just give me one chance
My words can be an inspiration

[Solo]

Wake up you're not that tough
(Wake up)
Believe me this is how it should be 
(This is how it should be)
