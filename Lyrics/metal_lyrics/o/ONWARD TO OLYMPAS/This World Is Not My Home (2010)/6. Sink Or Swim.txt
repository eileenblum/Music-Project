I wanted to be something
Something more just to help myself
But I'm sorry I couldn't help you out

These changes are a part of everything
that is the start of my new beginning
These changes are a part of everything
that is the start of my new beginning

And we've all been drowning
In an ocean of hatred
No exit in site
That was our fate
And the water is rising
And we can't seem to swim
Please don't let this tide pull us in

You were there in my life through anything
But as time went on we grew apart
Now are we suffering?
Things will be better now I just have this feeling
But I will stand through this
And life will overcome me

And we've all been drowning
In an ocean of hatred
No exit in site
That was our fate
And the water is rising
And we can't seem to swim
Please don't let this tide pull us in

But you keep coming back
I don't need this
I would give my life
I would die tonight

This is the start of something new
This is the start of something new
This is the start of something new
This is the start of something new
