Scared and afraid
Of what will happen to you
You run away

Not knowing what you will do
Turn you back on what you believe
Certain circumstances will come your way
Not knowing if that was the right move

You take the chance
Thinking you have nothing left to lose
But it all comes back
Crashing down in time

You think this is the only place for you
Not knowing if it was the right move
You turn your back on what you believe
Your home now don't cry to me

Limping back, crawling, trying to plea

You think this is the only place for you

Not knowing if it was the right move
You turn your back on what you believe
Your home now, don't cry to me

You can not run you have nowhere to hide [x6]
