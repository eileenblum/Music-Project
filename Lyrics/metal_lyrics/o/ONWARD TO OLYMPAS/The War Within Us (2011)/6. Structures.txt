How many countless times have I told you to step back? But, with a crushing blow your walls come down. You are nothing to me. I will not settle for failure, as I pull myself across that road. From darkness, to the place I once began, I can't deny your existence. Yours ways are just in their heads. Oh, if I could escape from you, then my life would be better. Oh, if I could escape from you, then my life would be better. This is a work in progress. The structures keep building. If you just have the patience and quit regretting.
