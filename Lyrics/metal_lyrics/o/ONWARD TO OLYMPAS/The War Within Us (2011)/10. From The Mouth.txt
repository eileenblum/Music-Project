So pull this mask down right in front of your face. I'm tired of seeing the signs, I'm tired of being this way. Will we sit back and watch the hate inside of us grow? Or accept the facts and let the life show? You've got me wondering why we were built to be this way. The bad taste in our mouths, our lies are laid. I only want to let you know how it felt to be in my position. When will we face ourselves? Now it's time I let this out. Spread it across, build your barriers up. Because you can't take the truth of what's to come. You're angry. You're thinking for yourself, to bring down the ones around you. Will you ever listen? Will you ever listen? Will you ever listen? I'm tired of speaking to the deaf. Spread it across, build your barriers up. Because you can't take the truth of what's to come. You're angry. You're thinking for yourself, to bring down the ones around you. You're angry, you're thinking for yourself. I will not accept the things that you will throw at me.
