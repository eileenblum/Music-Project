What do you want from me? What do I owe you? I will not sit back and watch you degrade my name. I will not take the blame. Is this what you wanted? I am not sure what this test is for. There always seems to be another side. I am not sure what this test is for. When will you open your mind. I know I make mistakes, but what have I done to make you think that I am so wrong? When we all vanish from this earth do you want to go with that disguise? When we all reveal our heart turn away so we can't see the lies. Unsuitable patterns. Unsuitable patterns. Take it all away. Take it all away. Face your old aggressions and face your lies. You will never win this fight. You can only ignore your integrity for so long before it backfires on yourself. Stand in the spotlight that will only shine so long. Should this be the truth we all have to face? Who is the wrong? Or who is the right? Clearly no one on this earth. But there is a higher power to wipe this all away.
