I once knew a man that thought he had everything. So many deep wounds to leave on stumbling. Take a breath and realize this world is falling from the only one we need. Why would this happen? How could he make it through? Until the clocks have stopped reminding us of all we had, when in realization all we had was nothing. Look around. Stay strong. In this time we are no one. But you are someone, you are something. Take a breath and realize this world is falling from the only one we need. Take a breath and realize that one simple thing can change the heart of a man. When you're coming to an end have faith and believe this life you live is for a reason.
