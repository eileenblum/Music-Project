Resurrection - it seems to me that this was completely over. I never knew how quickly things would change. What are the possibilities to encounter another let down? This is another chance to become more than you know. With more struggles built up, don't you think it's time to let go? This is said more easily than done. This is coming to an end. Without the soul central of the right mindset, your heart will slowly lose all passion. And without passion, who are you know? And when you've hit the very bottom, remember the One that will bring you up. Oh how the times have changed and how fast these problems have turned around. You will never recognize the difficulties and falling out. I know that this is who we are. This will be the new beginning. This will be the end. We are the end. We are everlasting.
