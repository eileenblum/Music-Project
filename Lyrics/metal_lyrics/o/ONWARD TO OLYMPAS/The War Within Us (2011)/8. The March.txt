We fight and we strive to be the greatest ones, to be the heroes. We fight and we strive, and it's been our goal for the longest time, to reach the point of perfection. But we're fighting a war that's already been won. One sacrifice brings us back to life. One man who died to save our lives. He won't give up on us. He won't give up on us. This war within us is so impossible to win alone. And we confide in Him, and we confide in Him, we cannot win alone.
