Up into the burning trees, his body stands lifeless. Staring up from the empty field. His mind is leaving, he's helpless, so helpless. All due to that little crush. He felt whole in that broken down musty house. Until the demons had chased him out. Running down that defiled dirt road, he'll find his own way out. So he finds his answers in the sky, his world is overcome by night. Fighting back for what he stands for, this whole world will know what he's about. Time is passing, bring an end to sight. They only try to seek what they can find.
