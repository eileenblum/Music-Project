A constant flame burning until the end with shame. I decided to let you know that what feels right, doesn't always feel right. Why deny that we'd be refrained, and why oh why does this feel the same? Why? Alright listen, you deserve much better than me and I wish I could fix your inability to love, but I cant. So why do I try so hard? Hey Lady, who do you think you are? This isn't the high-class bar!
