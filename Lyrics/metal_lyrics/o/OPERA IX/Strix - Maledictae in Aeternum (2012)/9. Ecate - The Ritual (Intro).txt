I celebrate Ecate Trivia, loving protector of the roads, Terrain, sea and celestial, the crocus coloured cloak.
Burial, firm with the souls of the dead.
Daughter of Crio, lover of solitude and supreme of the stags.
Nocturnal protector of dogs, invincible quee, announced by the howl of the beasts, unbeatable without a belt.
Domer of bulls, the lady that keeps the keys to the cosmos.
Mountain goer, guide, nymph, feeder of the young.
Of the young girl that begs to assist in the sacred rites.
Benevolent to her devotes, always with joyful soul.
