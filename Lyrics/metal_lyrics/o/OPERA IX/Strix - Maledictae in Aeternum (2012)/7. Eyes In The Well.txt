Dark waters from the earth doors to the underworld, magical portal without return.
Home for spirits guardians and demons.
They live there where no one can pass
Evil spirits with damned eyes.
The eyes of the well.
Glimmering and charming they hide the beauty of death inside.
Don't look into the well or you'll fall down.
Don't look into the well or you'll lost your aim.
Fashinated by the deep you'll become possessed by the eyes
Vertigo will take your head as your body trembles in fear.
A cold hand will touch your face and you'll fall into the oblivion.
Kissing the lips that have not to be touched, falling in the cold arms and their deadly embrace.
Your life will become nourishment for the ancient entity that lives here since acons.
Evil spirit with damned eyes.
The eyes of the well.
Don't look into the well or you'll fall down.
Don't look into th ewell or you'll lost your aim.
