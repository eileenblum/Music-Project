I spoke to thee my son.
Follow my will
I spoke to thee my slayer.
Be my arm
I spoke to thee my slave.
Obey for the eternal life.
You have to eliminate all those who don't practice my preaches.
You have to bring them salvation through flames and fear
Fiat voluntas tua sic in caelo et in terra
I had the revelation because I represent him on earth.
He wants you to kill in thy name.
For His glory for centuries to come.
In nomine pater filius et spiritu mortis
