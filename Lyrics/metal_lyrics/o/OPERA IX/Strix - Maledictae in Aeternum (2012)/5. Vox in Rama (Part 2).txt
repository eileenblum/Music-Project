Abomination to impose the only truth and the only law chains and sufferings for the absolution to die in peace.
Maledicti in aeternum sic in caelo et in terra
A I spoke you have to act, I'm the god's mouth
Through my lips you have the only truth and the truth is love
Love through tortures, to mound those who don't recognize my name.
My angels will burn and kill with strenght and perseveration and we will spread his word on a path of broken bones.
