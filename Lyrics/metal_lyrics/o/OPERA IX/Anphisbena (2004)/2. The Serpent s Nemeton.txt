Far-away echos accompany the dim lights of torches 
Old and mighty trees twine along the holy way of an ancient procession 
Simple but obscure songs are murmured in the deep arboreal temple 
Only two mighty blades shine in the reflection of fire 
From our directions come the old sages, each with his number and each carrying his ancestor's 
treasures 
Everything repeats as in an old prophecy marked by a vision donated by the Spirit of Nature 
And nothing is quiet in the dark heart of the forest 
It's inhabitants voices 
The breed of the trees and the men's mantra are part of a unique great ritual 
Nothing is quiet... nothing 
The four shining serpents slowly draw near to form a circle following the rhythm of 
Dark and deep rumbles like the heartbeats of a huge dragon as he is drawing near 
Everything wheels in an alchemist dance, where the symbols will become laws preserved 
By a family of sages, the men of the oaks 
Four serpents united and became one circular serpents, just one in the ancient nemeton 
Where each man was near his stones and symbols 
Now, everything is silent in the large forest 
And even the magical lights of the flames seem to burn out in the silence 
In the circle of men and stones, only the oldest one begins to sing a new but terrible prophecy
