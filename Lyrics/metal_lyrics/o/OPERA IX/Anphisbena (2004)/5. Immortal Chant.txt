I am the grey conqueror, he who's come by cold and storm 
The grey wolf called by the full moon, and the snarling beast hidden in the cold mist 
Brother Tree and Sister Stone 
Hear my call! Brother Thunder and Sister Night 
Announce my coming! 
May it's reflection be seen in the eye of the owl, and be amplified by the wolf's cry 
I'm the inborn hunting and the battle's fury 
The strangled breath of the escape and the vane hope of a refuge 
I'm the agony of the preyer and the red blood on the sword 
The creature suffocated gasp and the last plea before the void 
May glory walk beside me and death in the grey cloak follow 
May red poems of blood be traced by the cold steel in the pages of time 
I lift this immortal song, in memory of our fathers and in honour to our gods! 
May the past return to live in the shadow of the moutains 
In the darkness of the woods, and in the light of the plaines 
In the depth of the lakes, and at the heights of the glaciers 
In the grey humid mist, and in the hot mesmerizing sun 
Do not betray your fathers, and don't deny your instincts 
For we are the wolves for whom the preyer awaits 
Just like the old grey wolf, beneath the pale kiss of the moon 
We shout our war cry to the freezing sky we become death! 
So that nothing is betrayed 
Beneath this pale moon, I engrave my body is eternal signature of the corruptible flesh 
May night swallow day and the moon be tainted red! 
May the grey wolf return howling in the cold icy storm 
For nothing will ever be forgotten! 
May the spirits of my forefathers resurrect once more 
To erase the affronts inflicted to my land
