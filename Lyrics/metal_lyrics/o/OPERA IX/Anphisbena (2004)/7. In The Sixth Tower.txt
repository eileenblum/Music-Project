Shining in darkness the vary eyes of the lord o birds of prey announces the passing of time 
With his piercing call 
The thick dark leaves of the forest dance in the wind and in worshipful adoration 
The heavens tremble and the bright lightning flashes, leaving the heart's of the forests sons 
The howling of the wolves become a macabre litany 
Premonitions, obscure premonitions crawl in the night air 
Built on dragon's bones the imposing tower stands 
There the old of the oak turns the profaned sealed pages 
The timeless pages built on sacred and terrible rituals 
The wrinkled hands turn the pages, the hypnotic starring eyes nourish the thousand thoughts 
In the whirling magic of this silent ritual 
While the moonlight reflects the dragon's breath 
When the ancient gods ruled the earth, giving abundance and death with a simple and fair hand 
Glorious were their crowns, but the greed let the man to no longer follow the way of faith 
But only the path of power. His greed drove him to excavate the depths of the earth 
In search of hidden treasures 
The rocks were broken and scattered to extract gold and gems 
Mans disrupted the earth creating chasms liberating wealth and tremendous powers imprisoned 
In the womb of the earth for thousands of years 
Blinded by a mad quest, made pacts with the lord of the abyss 
Repayed with the supreme art of metals 
The sublimation of the elements earth, wind, water and fire 
Death and destruction would spread 
Blood of the guilty and the innocent may spill on earth nourishing the abyss
