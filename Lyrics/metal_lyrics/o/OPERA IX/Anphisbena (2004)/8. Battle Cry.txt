Impotently at the end of an era we assist 
As a last rampart we protect the ancient wisdom 
Our valour multiply our blades 
But this is not enough 
Falsehood and treason have reduced our lines 
And increased the ones of the enemy of the ancient gods 
Their thirst of lands and power will bring death and destruction for centuries to come 
The gods, offended by whom have blackened them, have forget us 
As two terrible dragons battle arrays clash 
One white as his prophet's livery, tint in nothingness and emptiness of his sentences 
The other one red, as shame and rage for thousand years of eggression endured 
Through sparks and flames, bloody rivers flood through the green plains 
The schock is terrible and many sons of the earth lost their lives on the field 
Brother they were, now full of hate infused by the priests of the god of the desert 
For a supposed difference of belives 
The white dragon dispers and disbound his enemies, divouring them with fierce 
Without mercy, without honour! 
And after our killing, they convert our sons with tortures 
They fill our sons hearts with fear and suspect, hate and ignorance 
Another era will have to pass over 
But nothing is linear in the circle of time 
The wyrd repeat himself and the forgotten forces will free themselves 
Gathering our sacrifice!
