My name is no-one and a thousand, but the old sages crowned me Queen Mother 
I am the breath you can hear among the leaves of the trees 
My sap emerges from the deep lakes flowing into the rivers and into the immense oceans 
My blood, hot and violent, cleaves the grounding a blazing trail left by a fire dragon 
Dark and deep is my womb where I generate any form of life 
Here, the ancient learned to receive the old supreme art 
I have created sprites and guardians, fools and sages to defend my original power 
Hidden in a language written on stone shapes and symbols 
Many where the children who worshipped my thousand faces with honour and respect 
And I, good and terrible, fed them at my sacred springs with water and dragon's flash 
Now I'm dying and so are all my faithful servants that men called Gods of Pagos 
Now, the power of the only god hangs over me 
And worse my fate will be if they forget about me 
And with me the most ancient legend carried on by purest emotions will end 
Follow the ancient path and don't turn to the false light 
Raise your arms to heaven and you'll be protected 
Let the spirit walk with your body and draw the cross in the circle 
Abandon the sufferings that belong to your false nature 
Love me and I will love you 
Hate me and I will devour you 
Descent into my crypts where the darkness of life reigns 
And nourish the eternal sacred flame 
Defend your brother tree and your sister stone because their lives are mine 
Follow the snakes' trail 
Because it will lead to me
