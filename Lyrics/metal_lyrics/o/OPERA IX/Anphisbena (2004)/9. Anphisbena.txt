Solitary and imposing the sacred tree wait the spirit's circle 
Night receive the silvery lightning star 
Take my hand, brother! And give it to a sister as we can close the spirit circle 
High parfumes spill in the air, celebrating again the time wheel 
The great golden serpent wrap again his throne 
Here his royal look meet his opposite, two visages facing themselves in the eternal fight for 
equilibrium 
From his wooden throne the black goat of the woods wait his dismemberment as a rites for a 
continous fertility 
The nine knights surround the sacred enclosure, carefull guardians from the profane eyes 
The virgins dance following the way of the mother 
For the ancestral rite give again gift of continuity at his nation, his ancient nation 
Who have protected his cult for centuries 
Fires shines in the dark night and the torches accompany the whirling dances as a serpent that wrap 
his pray 
Take my hand brother and give it to a sister, for we are the sacred circle of the spirits 
Protector and guardians of the ancient knowledge 
And turn your voice to thunder, because this night the mother will unite with the god 
And we'll have a new life and a new king 
The light of the fires shine on the Anphisbena, that is the millenary lady of the underworld 
She will welcome the new initiated in the eternal circular dance 
Magics and maledictions from the stone temples will be able to make nothing against 
The most ancient wisdom, neither the new knowledge 
And even in the knights of the cross will cut the sacred tree and will banish the serpent 
The ancient seed will germ again infusing new roots 
And a new and imposing tree will rise again under the double golden serpent sign
