Consecrate the altar with your symbols
This is the night when the breeze will
rekindles the sacred fire and when the
Sacred stones will sing your new name
It's the night of the breeze rekindling
the sacred fire, (it's the night) of the
sacred stones singing your new name.
Draw the circle with the athame and
undress your candid body
To let the eye of the Gods see your essence.
Guardians of the north, sacred spirits of
the earth In the dark of your warm womb
accept my death I offer you my greetings
and) I welcome you
Guardians of the east, sacred spirits of
the Air As the sun rises from the east
after the night, Guide my soul to a new
birth. (Lead my soul to a new dawn)
Guardians of the South, sacred spirits of
the Fire. Protect me and lighten my
journey on the new path Watch over me
and make my journey on the new path bright
and clear I offer you my greetings and
I welcome you Guardians of the west,
sacred spirit of the water Purify me and
make me clear as new spring I offer you
my greetings and) I welcome you Death is waiting and widening its
voracious mouth. I am entering the dark before the creation I am
entering the womb of the Goddess May my body born again May
my soul stay in peace May my heart be ready Sink yourself in the
warm Earth Sink your mind in the ancient litany Dark mother take me in Let me be
born again We all come from the same
womb This is the song of the goddess,
the key to the great union.
Anoint your breast and your womb
Widen the door of the new fate
And introduce yourself with your new
name Ensemble of flesh enlived by new
power Take the cup and the athame
raising your arms to the sempitern eye
As the cup is female so the knife is
male Now joined They bring blessing
Consecrate your sacrifice and
enjoy the gifts of the great mother
Close your circle and step over,
in the truth that all (the ) circles hold
Go now you, new creature
Now the master of the Only art
That all the arts contains
And where all the arts come from.
Live with honour
And with honour die.
You the master of the
Only arcane craft
That all the arts gathers..
