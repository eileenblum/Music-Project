I'm the encounter dance I'm the chain dance
I'm the blending of darkness and light
I lead the snake's circle in the thirteen moon's night
I give my blood to mother earth
Burn fire, burn bright Burn fire, burn bright
Fire.bright Fire.bright
Come to me, pure vision
Lead my steps in this night with the power of your light
Come to me, pure vision
Lead my steps in this night with the power of your light
Oh, master of winds and magic dances, take my
most solemn prayer with you in the star's circle
Listen to the invocation words Listen and reveal yourself, ISIS
Celestial arc, earth, Life's and death's donor,
Perhephone, astarte, astoreth, inanna
We are born from you. Lead us in the earth deep in ourself
Let us drink the hidden spring's water and we will see what we will not reveal.
I'm the end of the shady path,
Me, Diana of cross_roads, Hecate, Selene of the moon
Sink Into the eternal and primordial sleep
Sink Into the inner earth's secret heart.
Forget and keep silent, Drink persephone's water,
At the secret source, beside the sacred tree
Now I'm the secret queen
Of air and earth, of fire and water,
Of human souls and destiny's dream
The chant is dying out In a vibrating echo,
Dusk melting Into the silvery night of plenilune
Hoor Apep The depth's dragon will rise, now
Hoor Apep The depth's dragon will rise, now
Now
