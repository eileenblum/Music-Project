It's the night of shabat The plenilune feast
Rise from your mortal sleep and let your astral body glide away
With the sacred ointment Plunge into the new dream
Follow the way of the secret life
Silently graze archaic dimensions
On water and over wind
The god of woods call his sons,
Enraptured by his power,
Follow the divine melody
The magic key.
Penetrate the forest's heart and be led to the sabbath,
Till the flight's end.
Vivid flares flashing in darkness are reflected
In the owl's fixed eyes.
Walk along the hidden paths
Nine kinds of wood nourish fire and fire marks your destination
It reveals the glade
And the walnut you knew through the deer's eyes
Maleventum
A long black robe appears among the trees
His gaze lighted upon the moon
His barbarian hymn hails to the moon
Nine words of nine letters thunder in silence
And the night's star reveals its secret nature.
(hi)s shout opens the black diamond doors
the circle holds on tight to him
the old chant sing out..
Palas Aron Ozimonas
Baske Bano Tudan Donas
Geheamel Cla Orlay
Berec he pantaras tay.
