The breeze, with its tossing about, speaks of the movements on the water
Surface and sends out the shivers.

From those waves I will read the future fate.

Oh silphs, inhabitants of the Air,
Be the mediators between me and the immaterial beings
By Paralda dominated

So that I may decipher to roar of the wind
Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas

The ethereal foundation, void of every substance.
Ouroboros you are the void that everything is,
You are the primordial substance that is Chaos
Now no more shapeless and empty as the central fire
Vibrates and floods it with light
The real secret is still unspeakable
Only through the mediation of symbols it can be pronounced,
Its thought has been awaken by the changed vision of all things.
Oh silence, teach the disciple of the ancient wise men,
So that every shape may become expressive and every sign may suggest deep
vision

The snake, son of Apsu generates the Chaos,
Its motto is one for everything
