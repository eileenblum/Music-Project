[performed by Ophis]Bloodsoaked the Limbs of the Body
Slashed From a Thousand Cuts
Ripped and Slaughtered I Fall
Arteries Opened Wide
Lacerated
Vortex Whirling
My Skin, My Arms, My Face, My Eyes
A Living Dissection

Slice Lacerate
Cut Out My Guilt
Paint Engrave
The Signs That Do Reveal
Carved Written On
The Canvas of My Skin

A Million Razors of Glass
A Wall of Stainglass Bullets
Raging Through the Air Cutting Through My Flesh
In Violent Burning Winds
Cyclone Hailing Death

With Flesh Solit Open
With Fibres Torn Apart
The Winds Are Cold But Burning
Here I Fall

Silence Fills the Air
Voices Whispering In Guilt
Dead, Godless and Alone
The Winds Rise Anew

Verdict to Castigate
The Cycle Never Ends
Peace is Absent Here and So is Grace
Churning Torment
Into Ash Dissolve
Storms of Shards Raging Through the Void
Endlessly

Endlessly
