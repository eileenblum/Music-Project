The Swan has spoken
I can still taste the blood
The grip is broken
Supposed to rot
Like a bolt from the sky
Splitting the ground
I had to die
The buried ones I count

Your eyes are wide
Cruel and graceless stare
Gone is now the tide
Never I've been spared
Truth is what I see
The mirror never lies
Shows what waits for me
The mirror in your eyes

Standing on the other side
I shall always be
Black bird calling at my pride
"You shall never see!!!"
