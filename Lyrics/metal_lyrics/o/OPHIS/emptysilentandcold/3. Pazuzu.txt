Pazuzu - Lord of all fevers and plague
Bursting through - our intestines and souls
Our doom - by plague and hatred you're spawned
From Anu - almighty demon lord
Gaping jaws - behind your festering breath
Howl in pain - four-winged dark angel ascend
Pestilence - master lord of disease
Bringer of suffering

Blackest son - your pain eternal
Graceless one - enriched with anger and hate
Foul king - demon god of the sick
Lurk in darkness !!!
