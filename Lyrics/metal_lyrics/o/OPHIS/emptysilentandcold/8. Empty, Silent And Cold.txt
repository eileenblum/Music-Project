Empty
Silent
Cold
Deathwish

I don't want to live for others
I don't want to be forgotten
I don't want to feel so empty
I don't want to feel so silent and cold

I
Feel
Cold
Life
Is
Black

I don't want to feel so empty
I don't want to feel so silent and cold
I don't want to live forgotten
I don't want to be for the others
