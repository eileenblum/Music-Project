Foulmere
Never seen such a darkness before
Listen to the croaks and mourns
Ravens sing from a leafless tree
White fog across the murky sea
Lifeless mere...

Foulmere
Evil shades slide through the blood of the ground
The breath of hell, darkest nirvana
Black and cold, kissing my knees
Carols of tears swing through the silence
And I long to be buried inside of you
Of you...

Foulmere
Wails of the dead lost in stillness
Ancient towers hidden in fog
Witnessing all that I suffer
Gasp for air, filled with death

Ravens sing...
