I hate this world
I hate everything
I don't wanna be here at all
I wish I was dead
Or no... I wish everyone else was dead!

My skin is made of paper, burn it
My heart is made of glass, smash it into pieces
My soul is made of silk, rip it into shreds
Your truth can make me suffer, ram it up my ass

The weight of your words, like a feather on your lips
Tips my mind, crushing my soul!!

Sledgehammer assfuck

Come on and swing your mallet, pound it
The taste of coldest steel, full of pain and bitter
A sense of suffering, agonising, graceless
Now force your fun into me, rape my mind

Go ahead, pound it up my ass
I haven't suffered enough yet
Go ahead, fuck my soul, let me bleed some more
Rape me with your sledgehammer assfuck

The weight of your words, like a feather on your lips
Tips my mind, crushing my soul!!
