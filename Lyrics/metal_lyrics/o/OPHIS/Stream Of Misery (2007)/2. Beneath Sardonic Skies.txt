Swarm of ravens
Beneath sardonic skies
Carry the tunes
Of the jaded flute

Pale is his face
Lifeless his eyes
Slow are his steps
Marching through town

Deafening silence
Pierced by the call of his song
Women weep in tears
Men fall to their knees

Sweep through the air
Ring through the ears of the crowd
Sombre man in rags

They dance in the streets
To the rhythm of sorrow
And the only sound
Is the whispering of their tears

In silence they follow
Craving for death
They die in delight
Beneath sardonic skies
