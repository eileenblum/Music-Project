Screams from the depths beyond
Chants of grief in sickening tunes
Life â an obscenity
A joke perverse, a twisted lie

Blood pours from my wrist
For it shall wet the dried-out ground
Hell, thy mouth devour me
Consume my flesh, erase my soul

Storms of suicidal vibes
The urge to end this suffering
Yet we will not find peace
In our sleep, our endless night

Dormant spirits arise from their sleep
Haunting, hunting
Never leave me be

Resurrected nightmares tear at me
Tristis est anima mea
