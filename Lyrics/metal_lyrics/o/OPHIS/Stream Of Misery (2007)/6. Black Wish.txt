Oh how I long
For your happiness to end
The scale to take a turn
Your lights to fade away

With bloodshot eyes behold
The crawling of your senses
You shall be crushed

Crushed!!!

All that you love
Shall turn into ashes
All that you care for
Reduced to nothingness
All that is precious
Devoured by emptiness
All your colours
Shall turn black

All your melodies shall lose their tunes
And your laughter shall be mute

Your ever fleeting river of life
Shall become a stream of misery
Endlessly downwards
Raging, but silent

Silent my smile
Warm are my eyes
Waiting in patience
For the seal of my fury to break
