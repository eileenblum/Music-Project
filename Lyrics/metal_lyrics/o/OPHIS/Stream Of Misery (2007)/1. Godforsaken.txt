Sick perverted deities
Vain and irate
Spitting on pride
Kings of decay

Mandatory self-denial
Wallow in filth
Like cattle, like pigs
Bow to excrement

Crawl at their feet
To their amusement, sick with disease
Their shining golden masks
Conceal the putrid faces

Disgusting choirs
Swarms of flies darken the bleeding sky
For they herald the arrival of Heaven
Unclimbable monolithic towers
Effigies of desolation

The slaughter keeps going on
Until all your pride is taken
I am proud to be
Godforsaken
