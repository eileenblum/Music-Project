Dead inside
My decomposing mind
Where nothing lives or thrives
Internal abscence of life

Why did you hurt me
And why did you hurt me again
Why is it still there
And why is it burning within

Dead inside
My emotions petrified
Where Spes and Amor die
And passionâs sterilized

Awaiting the blow
The burst of a trigger inside
But the sound is just hollow
Because the embers have died

When lungs are breathing
And tongues are speaking
When hearts are beating
And blood is leaking
That doesnât mean a thing

Dead inside
My emotions petrified
Where Spes and Amor die
And passionâs sterilized

Dead inside
My decomposing mind
Where nothing lives or thrives
Internal abscence of life
