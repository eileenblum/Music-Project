There is no love
It's just an illusion
There is no hope
It's just a fake
There is no light
It's just a blink
There is no life
We find just death

There is no gain
It's just for loss
There is no truth
It's just a lie
There is no god
He's just our pain
There is no end
We never stop

There is nothing good
There is nothing evil
There's nothing of worth
There's nothing but decay
