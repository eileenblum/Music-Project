You never see what I am seeing
You never felt like I am feeling
You'll never bleed like I am bleeding
Because of that distance

Torn apart
Behind glass
Torn apart

No matter where you touch me
No matter what you teach me
Because our point of melting
Is forever out of reach
Because of that distance

Torn apart
Behind glass
Torn apart

You never see what I am seeing
You never felt like I am feeling
You'll never bleed like I am bleeding
Because of that distance
That distance between us

Torn apart
Behind glass

Torn apart
