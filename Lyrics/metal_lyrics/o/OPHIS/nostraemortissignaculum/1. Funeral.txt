Lower her down
Into the cold embrace of the earth
Chilling wind
Tender and cold like herself
Weeping grass
The spade in my hand

My Cold tears
Could not melt the ice
The frozen shape
Around her soul

Her ebon casket
The white silk inside
Close the lid and forget
Upon the silent hill

My Words go down with you
Only flesh remains

Nothing reminds of her
No sign, no mark
Frozen earth
Covering her
And yet I feel
Her kiss is still inside me
