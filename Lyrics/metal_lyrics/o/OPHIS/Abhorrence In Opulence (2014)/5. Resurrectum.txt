Morbid consumption swallowed
Vomit regurgitation repulsed
Splattered across the floor
Rotting in sunlight
Spawning wriggling larvae
Swept into the drain

Crippled gears mechanic
Broken tubes machinery
Shifting into idling
Deadlocked circuit collapse

Castigation
Flagellation
Transfixation
Hell

Praise the lord's most twisted joke
We provide the pain he feeds on

I stare into you milky eyes
A window to the soul
With curtains closed
And nailed shut
Crown of all creation
Now defunct, sullen
Crown of all creation
Drowning in infirmity

Life is luxury
Sacred father merchant
Charging the price
For the poor

What He grands
He can take
We are condemned
To His joy
We shall praise
Our own hell
Straw is pulled
Fuck you, God !
