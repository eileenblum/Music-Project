Sleep came
Like an ornery guest
Came late, left early
And brought bad company

Within the wellless keep of Somnus
Ghostlike memories arise from the moat
The vast ballroom is a courtyard
Figures sway in abussic grace

Sleepless in sleep
Infernal revenants
They scream, accuse
Insane

Visions from the looking glass
Bear a truth obscene
A sick libertto
And here they speak
The silent dead
They echo through the labyrinth
They stare in through the windows

Towering fears
Ethics reversed
In morbid choreography
Inverted lights flicker

Mimetic landscapes
Dissonant chords
All out of measure
An ensemble defunct

Sleepless in sleep
Infernal revenants
They scream, accuse
Insane

As daylight draws
The music ends
But the silence is not real
I know they will return
