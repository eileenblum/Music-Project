Pernicious world perception
Cognition of symbols oblivious
Fragments reassembled
To a picture beyond this world

The curse of carination
Slow detachment

The cord of apprehension
Textures ever shifting
Affliction, obsession of silence
Reflection dolorous

Her meaning of meaning
Estrangement from being
A new found logic
Abides a realm beyond

Constrained oblivion
A world without mirrors

Her meaning of meaning
Abducted from seeing

The hours sink to the ground
And she is counting the bricks

I still remember
Cold January morning
The world beneath a sheet of snow
You would not stop screaming

And thus you rejoice
This river you just could not transcend

Drawn towards the water
Pulled beneath the waves
Whispering from the depth
A beckoning from the edge of the world

And our songs
Forever shrouded in mist
Yet just for a blink
I felt your presence here

The hours sink to the ground
And the hours sink to the ground
