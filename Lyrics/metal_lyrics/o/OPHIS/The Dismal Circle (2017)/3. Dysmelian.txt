Toxic sermon
Erratic and contagious
Abscessic thoughts
Raging through the aether

Seraphic beauty obsolete
A relic dream, pathetic and distant

Hear them screaming for a new sovereign
An idol to their likeness

He shall come to bring salvation
An icon for the crippled race
A mirror to reflect their souls
Disfigured God for distorted people

Phocomelic
Despair
Syndactylic immersion of flesh
Scoliotic rotten lord

I beg thee
To come forth
From the womb
Putrid pile, anal birth

Hear them screaming for a new sovereign
Dysmelian now walks the earth
