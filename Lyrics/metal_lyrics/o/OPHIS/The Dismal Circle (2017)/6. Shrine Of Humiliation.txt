Gleam onto me
Pass thy disdain
Onto my misery

Release me
From the mirror
My fiercest
Enemy

Lambaste me
For I can see
I am chosen
Chosen

Look at me
Look at my pity
Is this no relief?
The riddance of dignity

What is hollow cannot sink
What is shapeless cannot break

Bequeath me
The blessing of shallowness
My existence devoted
As reflection of your emptiness
