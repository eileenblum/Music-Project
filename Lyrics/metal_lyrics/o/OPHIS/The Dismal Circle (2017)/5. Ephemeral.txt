Ephemeral
We must fade
Ephemeral
Withered shades

Silent
Falling leaves
Longing for
Breath to cease

Life in itself
Deteriorated
Open those veins
To purge this maze
To end this haste
Distant and cold
Gathering clouds
As autumn unfolds

We are as water
And life as a slope
Death lingers on
Through nights to come

Ephemeral
Nothing remains
Ephemeral
Even the pain
