Opaque clouds ensnare me
Glaring stars shrouded

Black breath whirling
Feet sunken in sludge
Soul leashed to a stick

Embalmed in dejection
Preserved tribulation
Chrysalis surge
From the maggot hatchery

Beneath this hollow face
Lie the answers to all questions
But they are never asked
And of no relevance

Embalmed in dejection
For aeons to come
Painted in piss
Glorious depiction of the vermin age

And bound to death
Be this entire breed
Spawned by the maggot queen
That lies entombed in this world

Ancient soulless majesty
Insatiable, gnawing, devouring all light
Lux fiat!
Her avarice everlasting
