burn to my touch
at my feet incinerate
scorch both flesh and spirit
weep and falter

upon the litis step
towards my burrow
destigial
blitheness
spawning mournful dreams
wiping the light from the sky
immerse with my sickness

the suffering i radiate
a beacon at the shores of hell
attached to decline
lapse into decay
into the dismal circle
