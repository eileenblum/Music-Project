Trapped in a grave
Flatlined I dwell
Where there is no light.
Trapped in a hell
That shall be called âlifeâ

Buried in the box in my chest
To burn eternally
A passion silent, painful.

The person I shall become maybe one day
Waiting eternally for release, for relief
Waiting eternally for things to change
Waiting eternally for the world to end

Waiting eternally
Waiting for ages
Waiting eternally
For the pale face
Waiting eternally
Waiting for ages
Waiting eternally
to become alive

Wonders need time
But a human life is nothing.
Nothing of worth, or to create
That remains but pain

A world that has nothing to offer
But eternal darkness
Willingly I accept the gift
Of endless suffering
