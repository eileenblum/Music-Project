Dance blindly
In the gleam of the broken lamp
The crippled nature outside
Is mocking your wretched being
The only language left
Is coughing and sobbing
The scars on the wrist
Keep on itching

Once you heard about God
An abstract story unimaginable
Such a graceful entity
Can clearly not exist

Endless sunlight
Permeate me
Suffocate me
Burst my blisters
Swarm of locusts
Lead our way
Through the ruins
To the graves

Collapsed lungs
Bleached skin and empty eyes
Toothless mouth and paper tongue
Muscles limp and seedless eggs
Welcome to our troglodyte legacy
