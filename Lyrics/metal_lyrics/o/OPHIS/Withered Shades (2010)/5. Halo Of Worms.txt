In scorn and pestilence...

Leathery wings spread over me
Orifice now pouring blood
Violent throes in crimson cascades
Excretion from a thousand wounds

Yearning through infinity
Obscene beauty in neon dreams
Under a halo of worms

Singularity is a void domain
Abortion of another hope
Rectal thoughts of septic icons
Abomination born from bliss
Hate is all thatâs left
