Nailed to the walls
The limbs torn from torsos
With eyes turned to the ceiling
The bloody mouth agape

Vast monumental space
Monolithic pillars paved with skulls
Eerie cold and the stench of death
From the walls of blackened stone

Behold
The banners of pestilence
Behold
The charnel throne, desolate
Behold
The beauty of vileness
Unfold
Within these silent walls

Crippled and withered shades
Of a decrepit beauty
Sway solemnly
Over the tapestry of rotting corpses

Climb the stairs
Kneel to the throne
Breathe (breathe) the death-filled air
And become one
With the abomination

This is where suffering is born
