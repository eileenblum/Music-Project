To medieval tunes
By the solemn river
With pawns and jesters
Swayed through the never

Bleak concrete walls
Concealed the coven
Where the pyre was lit
Where the net was woven

Spring rain turned
To summer flame
It burned the roots
And winter came

Snow covered the fields
Tiger lillies bloomed
Limbs lay entwined
On a soil doomed

Your beauty left scars on me
Even in death pain is with me
The suffering that Heaven gave
Followed us beyond the grave

Now the wailing choirs
Have soothed the seas
The roaming clouds
And the whispering trees

Spring rain turned
To summer flame
It burned the roots
And winter came
