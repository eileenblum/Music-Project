Do you remember board game called The Star of Africa. All players will receive three hundred bucks, start-up money. Throw the dice and move what it shows.
You can travel on foot, by ship, or by aeroplane.

Woo-oo-o-woo-oo-o-woo-o-oo-oo
Who will find it first?

If you reach a city where there's a token, you have three options, continue as normal, buy the token or try to win it by throwing Fyra, Fem, Sex.

Just like the brightest diamond, you shine in a way that no one else does. Let me hold you and take you away. Are you ready for an adventure of a lifetime? After this, there's no turning back. You are my Star of Africa. Let me hold you forever.

I recommend this game to girls, 'cause this is your chance to get some diamonds. So sweet and so beautiful, but be careful, 'cause there are robbers too, and they'll take it all, and they'll take it all.

You, you shine like a gemstone. I will travel the world for you, for you... For you. Lifetime (adventure of lifetime). I'm going to steal your diamonds, bitch. And they'll take it all. And they'll take it all.
