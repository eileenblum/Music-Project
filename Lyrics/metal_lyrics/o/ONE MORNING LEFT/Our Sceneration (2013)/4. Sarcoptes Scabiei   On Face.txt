Get on your knees you lying bitch
You can only talk shit, so keep it real
Every word that you said
Disappear into thin air

There's no point pretending this
I just wanna see your lying blue eyes
Every word that you said
Disappear into thin air

Always imagined the things you said were just something real
But maybe between the lies and the hate, fear takes its place
And is it all for nothing now, pretending it's all the same
Losing the dream that made me believe that there is something real
And if we keep pretending, pretending it's all the same
Lies we keep coming, the secrets we hide, it's all for nothing

Always imagined the things you said were just something real
But maybe between the lies and the hate, fear takes its place
And is it all for nothing now, pretending it's all the same
Losing the dream that made me believe that there is something real
And if we keep pretending, pretending it's all the same
Lies we keep coming, the secrets we hide, it's all for nothing

Why can't you change your style
What the fuck do you
Think about this life
You fucking stupid whore

But I love your smile
When you bring up new lie
New lie!

But I love your smile
When you bring up new lie
New lie!

But I love your smile
When you bring up new lie
And I love that feeling
When you think that I believe you
