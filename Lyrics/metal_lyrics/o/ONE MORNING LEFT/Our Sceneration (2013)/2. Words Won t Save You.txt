I will bring you down

This ends right here
I'm not gonna crawl in front of you
I refuse to be your slave
I decided to break my way out
Through your selfish way to live

This will end all the suffering
This will rip your heart apart
No excuse to take this anger back
No excuse to save your
Save your heart

I'm about to make you feel something that'll put you on your knees
I'm about to make you feel something that'll put you on your knees
How does it feel
How does it make you feel

Five, four, three, two, one
Let's go, whore

How does it make you feel
When all that you've done
All that you've done drags you away from me
No one can save you now
All that we built over the years
You lit a match and burnt it all away
Word's won't save you now

Tasting the bitterness made me do it
Tasting the bitterness makes me do this

Fight for your life
For yourself
For your own disgrace
Fight for your life
For yourself
For your own disgrace

I'm about to make you feel something that'll put you on your knees
I'm about to make you feel something that'll put you on your knees

How does it feel
How does it make you feel

Words won't save you now
