[Bonus Track]Have a real conversation, you told me everything you knew
Guide me through all these problems, I know that I don't need to hide

I am so grateful that I have parents like you, so grateful
You were always ready to help me at all times, when I was losing myself
You gave me everything, I never deserved this

Have a real conversation, you told me everything you knew
Guide me through all these problems, I know that I don't need to hide

Thanks for everything and thanks for standing by my side forever
Finally I have a chance to attend to both of you, cause you really deserve it
I can't find the words, how can I thank you.
Hopefully u know that, that I will always love you.
You gave me everything, I never deserved this

Have a real conversation, you told me everything you knew
Guide me through all these problems, I know that I don't need to hide

Now I know, now I know that I don't need to hide no more I know that's you love me

Maybe I am not so good but I really try to do my best and I always will try to do my best

Mother, You gave me everything!
Mather, You gave me everything!
Mother, You gave me everything!
Mather, You gave me everything!

Mother, father, you motherfucker, father, you motherfucker
