You better,
Back down no lie will make me turn ever
It's hatred prevents us from being better
Manpower the key, dreams live forever
In da bring of extinction we strong together

You said you hate, but fact is I know
I said, a man can poison his own soul
Keep hatin' it ain't a story untold
Finding in be easy but out is a goal

Keep pushing us a side cos you'll never understand!
To be hated makes us feel alive

You hate, we grow much stronger!

Keep pushing us a side cos you'll never understand!
To be hated makes us feel alive

Haters makes me famous

You hate, we grow much stronger!

Haters push us, Haters make us, haters take us, take us to the stars!

Keep pushing us a side cos you'll never understand!
To be hated makes us feel alive

Keep keep talking, ill get more power from your words and it makes me feel alive

Keep pushing us a side cos you'll never understand!
To be hated makes us feel alive
