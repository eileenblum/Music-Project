WTF, what is this pain?
Jack hammer's pounding my brain
Vacant eyes are staring at me,
Shattered mirrors, I don't care

Is it me?

Try to be calm
Try to rest
There is nothing wrong inside your chest
TIC TOC
TIC TOC TOC TOC
Heart goes, it goes...
Try to be calm
Try to eat
Pick up the pieces and make the ends meet
TIC TOC
TIC TOC TOC
Heart goes, it goes, it goes

Pull yourself together

Try to run
Try to hide
There is no way out of this ride

Falling free, faster we are running
Younger we die
Falling free, still falling free

Did I screwed everything
Yesterday
She knows

Fuck that, I'm alive.
Never regret the day before you die.
Some stop, some run.
The Faster we are running, the younger we die.

Try to run
Try to hide
There is no way out of this ride
TIC TOC
TIC TIC TOC TOC
Clock goes, it goes, it goes

Did I screwed everything
Yesterday
She knows

Try to run
Try to hide
There is no way out of this ride

Falling free, I'm falling free-
Stars in my eyes and bruises on my feet
Falling free, I'm falling free-

Did I screwed everything
Yesterday
She knows

Fuck that, I'm alive.
Never regret the day before you die.
Some stop, some run.
Faster we are running, younger we die.

Just try
Just try
Just try
