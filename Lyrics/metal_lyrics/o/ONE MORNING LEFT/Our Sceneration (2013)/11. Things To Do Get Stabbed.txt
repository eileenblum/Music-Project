Where did it come from, needless to say.
It's here to fuck our world

What, whAT

Can you believe it, I mean really?
You could laugh your ass off but you'll come to realize
This time, there's no laughter
Time stands still in this room

Get a grip
Take a stance
He's armed,
You are not

Fray
Fray
This pain

My best buddies like Chuck Norris
Or Steven Seagal
Would know what to do when seriously wounded
But I just fall downnnnnn

These voices calling out for me
Try to wake me, try to breathe
Try to save me

Here again, eyes wide open
Wounds in my body but still alive

These voices calling out for me
Try to wake me, try to breathe
Try to save me

You cant snuff this rooster
