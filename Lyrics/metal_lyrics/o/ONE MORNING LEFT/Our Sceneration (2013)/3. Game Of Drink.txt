Go, go! Let's Go!
Everybody drink more
This is the night when we have some fun
Let's sing together
Tonight we're all gonna be so wasted, be so wasted

Go, go! Let's Go!
Everybody drink more
This is the night when we have some fun

Let's sing together
Tonight we're all gonna be so wasted
Be so wasted!

Tonight we dance
Tonight we're on fire
Can you drink us under the table
We feel free and you should too
Come on, come on, let's get wasted

More and more
What the fuck're you looking for
Tonight I'm gonna be so wasted
That I will lose my mind, that I will lose my mind

Who's gonna challenge me to a drinking game?
Who's gonna challenge me to a drinking game?

First shots, show what you got, there is no turning back
Second shots, show what you got, there is no turning back
Third shots, show what you got, there is no turning back

More and more
What the fuck're you looking for
Tonight I'm gonna be so wasted
That I will lose my mind, that I will lose my mind

KÃ¤lÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤kÃ¤lÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤

Tonight we dance
Tonight we're on fire
Can you drink us under the table
We feel free and you should too
Come on, come on, let's get wasted

We came to rock your town
It's time to take some shots
We came to rock your town
It's time to take some shots

So let's get wasted
Cheers bitch!

We came to rock your town
It's time to take some shots
We came to rock your town
It's time to take some shots

I drink you under the table!

This is how we party
