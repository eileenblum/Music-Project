I draw my own future by myself
Whole picture looks like an exploded bomb

These fucking years are killing me
I don't care about this shit anymore

You should know that I need you so much
Where have you been cause this time I really need you "my guardian angel"

Come on and show the light and heal my bruises

YEAH!

Don't be afraid cause I feel the same
Don't be insane cause you'll lose this game
Don't fear your thoughts just follow the order
Just be quiet and look forward

No one deserves anything like this
This is a game of love without me

Things that you heard, the ones that made you silent
Just like when you were young, afraid of falling.

I draw my own future by myself
Whole picture looks like an exploded bomb, looks like an exploded bomb

You should know that I need you so much
Where have you been "my guardian angel"

Come on and show the light and heal my bruises

Things that you heard, the ones that made you silent
Just like when you were young, afraid of falling.
