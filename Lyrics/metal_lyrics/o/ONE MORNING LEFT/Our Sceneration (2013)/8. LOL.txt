We are always searching
Trying to figure out something
Hiding behind these memories
Looking back to yesterday

What are we looking for in life
There are so many offers
Just make your own choices
And build your own life
This is what I can offer to you

I'm still worried about you
Take my hand and become stronger
Feed your soul, feed your heart
Inspire your mind

We are always searching, what is it that we searching for
We are always searching

WHere do we go!

What are we looking for in life
There are so many offers
Just make your own choices
And build your own life
This is what I can offer you

Take my hand and become more stronger
Than ever

We are always searching, what is it that we searching for
We are always searching
