You will shine like a rising sun
Brightness melts my look
I must finish this desperate rat race

We're too proud to admit that we were wrong
And it takes us so deep commit suicide
This is my deepest dream
Falling into the darkest grave
Too proud to admit that we were wrong and it shames us so deep

Itâs time to clean up this mess
Bury those fears and wash these filthy hands again

Back to square one
Looking for the one
Who can offer her shoulder
When I will die old
Fighting in circles
Looking for peace
Back to sleep
I'm gonna leave this dream behind me

We're too proud to admit that we were wrong
And it takes us so deep commit suicide
This is my deepest dream
Falling into the darkest grave
Too proud to admit that we were wrong and it shames us so deep

I feel so weak, so witty, so genial, this mess was not so fucking brilliant
We're too proud to admit that we were wrong, so we shame ourselves
Commit suicide
