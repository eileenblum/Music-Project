Bakeware of mayhem, ingredients of chaos; no matter what you cook with them it will be a failure
Step aside, I know how to throw a proper show! It is time for all of you to learn!
Eye for an eye, innocence must die! Sacrifice your heart for the ultimate recipe
Eye for an eye, innocence must die! Sell your soul to me!
Wash your hands, put on your apron; today we are making a greedy nation
I am hunger! I am gluttony! I am the serpent! I am agony!
I am the devil himself in the flesh!
Take a bite! It's divine! The secrets of the world in your hands; I will show you everything
Worship me, on your knees, say that I'm the one and only, and all the power in the world is yours
Do as I say, follow the instructions, enjoy the view of greedy corruption
Once they get a taste of what I've made they are bound to go my way!
Bakeware of mayhem, ingredients of chaos; no matter what you cook with them it will be a failure
Step aside, I know how to throw a proper show! It is time for all of you to learn!
A teaspoon of hate, a pint of jealousy, a gallon of pride; that's the recipe!
