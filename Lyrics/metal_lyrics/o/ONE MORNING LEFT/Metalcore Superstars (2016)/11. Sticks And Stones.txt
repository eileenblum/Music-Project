Sun is up! Let's have some fun! Let's grab some sticks and pretend they're guns!
We are thieves, you are cops; nobody quits and nobody stops!
Who's the fastest? Who's the strongest? Which one of us can jump the highest?
I'm the master! You need to get faster, because I just caught you; tag! You are it!
Close your eyes and count to ten! We will all be gone by then!
I stay still and hold my breath, I hope you find me before I'm dead!
Close your eyes and count to ten! We will all be gone by then!
I stay still and hold my breath, I hope you find me before I'm dead!
I'm a horrible sea monster, here to destroy your city! You came to stop the slaughter, a hero so handsome and witty! Let's fight!
Close your eyes and count to ten! We will all be gone by then!
I stay still and hold my breath, I hope you find me before I'm dead!
Close your eyes and count to ten! We will all be gone by then!
I stay still and hold my breath, I hope you find me before I'm dead!

Space monsters from outer space! Attacking our defense base! Force fields up, prepare your cannons; victory is the only thing that matters!
Close your eyes and count to ten! We will all be gone by then!
I stay still and hold my breath, I hope you find me before I'm dead!

Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me! It's the things that I could have said; they will always haunt me!
Seize the day; surround yourself with people that won't cause you pain, because you will never be as carefree as a child again
Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me! It's the things that I could have said; they will always haunt me!
Seize the day; surround yourself with people that won't cause you pain, because you will never be as carefree as a child again
Take me back to carefree times when there weren't dark clouds in the sky, oh how I wish to be there, feel the summer breeze in my hair
I'll feel it once more
