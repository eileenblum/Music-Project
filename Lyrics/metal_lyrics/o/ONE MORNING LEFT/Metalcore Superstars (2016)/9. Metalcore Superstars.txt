Every mountain I've had to climb, all the strength I've had to find, all the struggles inside my mind
Have led me to this moment
Bring it on! I'm fucking ready! You are about to witness something unpretty! All I can feel for you is fucking pity
'Cause you will be crushed!
Every mountain I've had to climb, all the strength I've had to find, all the struggles inside my mind
Have led me to this moment, you will be crushed!
There's no excuse for defeat, I need to conquer all my fears, head up high, stand up tall; you are all about to fall!
There's no excuse for defeat, I need to conquer all my fears, head up high, stand up tall; you are all about to fall!
Come at me with everything you've got! All the power in the world won't be enough against me!
Come at me with everything you've got! All the power in the world won't be enough against me!
Woo oo oo time to reach for the gold! But the gold won't be enough for me; 'cause I want the whole wide world
Woo oo oo time to reach for the gold! But the gold won't be enough for me; 'cause I want the whole wide world
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end!
I will make my brothers proud, I'll be praised by a cheering crowd!
