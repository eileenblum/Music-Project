Say what you wanna say; we see through you anyway. This means war!
You are dead! Let's disco!
You won't bring us down with you anymore because you failed to see that we have grown
It's always the same routine; first you seem like you've come clean and then you stab our backs with your words of pain
It's always the same routine; first you seem like you've come clean and then you stab our backs with your words of pain
We won't take your shit no more!
Say what you wanna say; we see through you anyway. This means war!
Say what you wanna say; we see through you anyway. This means war!
You are dead! Let's disco!
Go away! There's the door! We won't take your shit no more!
Go away! There's the door! We won't take your shit no more!
You won't bring us down with you anymore because you failed to see that we have grown
You are nothing but an empty shell, we all hope that you burn in hell
It's always the same routine; first you seem like you've come clean and then you stab our backs with your words of pain
It's always the same routine; first you seem like you've come clean and then you stab our backs with your words of pain
We won't take your shit no more!
Say what you wanna say; we see through you anyway. This means war!
Say what you wanna say; we see through you anyway. This means war!
You are dead! Let's disco!
Go away! There's the door! We won't take your shit no more!
Go away! There's the door! We won't take your shit no more!
Burn in hell! Never never never never never come back!
Go away! There's the door! We won't take your shit no more!
