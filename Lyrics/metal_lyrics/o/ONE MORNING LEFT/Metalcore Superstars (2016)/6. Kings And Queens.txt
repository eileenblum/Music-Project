This world has seen death of a thousand dreams, the falls of many kings and queens
I've lost your flame, make it come back again or the colors of my world will fade
Growing in the dark the demon of agony; monster of misery
You're the brightest star with your flame we'll light everything we can be anything
Kings and queens will bow before us, the bravest men will be afraid
Empires will burn beneath us, singing glory to our flame
This world has seen death of a thousand dreams, the falls of many kings and queens
I've lost your flame, make it come back again or the colors of my world will fade
Growing in the dark the demon of agony; monster of misery
You're the brightest star with your flame we'll light everything we can be anything
I will be the petrol of your beautiful dying flame
The moment you touched my heart the hunger hasn't gone away
Light the fire, take us higher, so everyone can see our burning desire
I am the night, you are the day, nothing will ever take away our flame
Light the fire, take us higher, so everyone can see our burning desire
I am the night, you are the day, nothing will ever take away our flame
This world has seen death of a thousand dreams, the falls of many kings and queens
I've lost your flame, make it come back again or the colors of my world will fade
This world has seen death of a thousand dreams, the falls of many kings and queens
I've lost your flame, make it come back again or the colors of my world will
Light the fire, take us higher, so everyone can see our burning desire
I am the night, you are the day, nothing will ever take away our flame
