The moment of freedom is at hand, everything goes just as we planned
We stand united, breaking through your spell. We will never ever be thrown back to hell
You can see us walking as free men, this time we won't make the same mistakes again
The colors are alive, the clarity of mind; how did we ever get so fucking blind?
The colors are alive, the clarity of mind; how did we ever get so fucking blind?
The moment of freedom is at hand, everything goes just as we planned
We stand united, breaking through your spell. We will never ever be thrown back to hell
You need to take a look in the mirror, for us the truth has never been any clearer
The hate you feed will always hold you down
