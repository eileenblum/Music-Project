Come to my house, let's have a party, what is mine is yours
From a man to a mouse, a worthless army, my mind fights many wars
This mask rarely falls off but when it does it shocks everyone, are you ready to see the man behind the blue eyes?
Nothing is what it seems! Get fucking ready to see the man behind the blue eyes!
The two sides of the coin you throw I hide in plain sight and grow
Come to my house, let's have a party, what is mine is yours
From a man to a mouse, a worthless army, my mind fights many wars
A place to rest, the devils nest, welcome every tired guest! A sheep costume is what I wear, a wolf in disguise; you can't sleep here!
