Verify my love, Are you ready for this, show your creed, faith, hope and love,
we want more and more, are u ready for this, show your love, mistakes occur,
before I fall, Nothing can save me, Frozen mind drawing on the wall,
just me and you, look inside of me, and tell me what you see,
so come a little bit closer to me tonight and take my breath away,
just me and you, just give me a chance, verify my love, are u ready for this,
show your love, faith, hope and love, we want more and more,
are u ready for this, take your last breath, put your wings down,
mind fresh and bless my choices and bless my soul, show the better way,
we're feeling free, free like a bird, show the better way,
we're feeling free like a free bird
