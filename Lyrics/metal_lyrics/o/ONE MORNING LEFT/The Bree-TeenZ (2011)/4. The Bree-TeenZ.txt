I give my best shot, I'm born again, because, because of you,
you fixed my heart, the last day was a miracle
I felt when that shine touched my skin, everything I have is yours
everything I need is yours, everything I feel is yours, only who I love is you,
losing my life, losing my time, losing my side, losing my mind, losing my bride,
I'm losing everything where I stand so help me up,
Wishing I never lied to you, don't turn your back on me
I'll hope the sun will rise (when the sun rise) those shadows crawling in my skin,
I'm just asking how much is your life worth, back to back, isn't you isn't me,
here there is no sense of humor, hey pretty boy, don't be sure that there
is a tomorrow after the sunset, give your last prayer,
Wishing I never lied to you, don't turn your back on me
I'll hope the sun will rise,  this is on my own,
losing my life, losing my time, losing my side, losing my mind, losing my bride,
I'm losing everything where I stand so help me up,
Wishing I never lied to you, don't turn your back on me
I'll hope the sun will rise (when the sun rise)
