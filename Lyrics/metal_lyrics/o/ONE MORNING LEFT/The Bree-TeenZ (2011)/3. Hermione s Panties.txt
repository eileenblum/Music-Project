This is a war, don't ignore, I can't get out of this, so shitty, so mindless
just waiting for when these words collide, pray for mercy,
this is our last goodbye, just make no sense to laugh from happiness,
it makes me sick, just take your weapon and aim at my head,
just pull the trigger and blow my head off,
I keep telling things to you, and they hurt inside
tearing your heart apart, never wanted to die alone
this is a war, don't ignore, you baby drive me crazy,
so sweetie so priceless just waiting for when these hearts collide
she's been so fucking so fucking heartless, she has the power
screw up my life, I'm so fucking afraid, so please let me go
no second chances, I keep telling things to you and they hurt
inside tearing your heart apart, never wanted to die alone
I was scared but I healed
