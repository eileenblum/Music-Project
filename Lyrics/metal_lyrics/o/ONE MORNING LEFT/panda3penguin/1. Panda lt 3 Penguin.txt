This morning I really felt alive, alive
So when we spent sometime together, we all together
You made me smile again, again
You ignited my fire again

All the tears have flown down to re-create me
I know we both are in the right hands anyway

I'm standing below your window
And hopefully throwing stones
You look at me, look at me
And Then you turn away

I cant believe this! [4x]

This morning I really felt alive, alive
So when we spent sometime together, we all together
You made me smile again, again
You ignited my fire again

A melancholy shade behind that broken glass
Don't be so worried
My hands are blessing you
Oh, let me say something beautiful to you
Oh, let me feel your lips touching my skin
