On
They try to keep as apart
With a distance million miles long

WHO EVER YOU ARE

Time to concentrate
Time to focus on what you've made
Reveal your mistakes

Without the sense of right and wrong
I turned it upside down
Too many times I thought this would be nothing
Nothing meaningful

Falling to the Ground, on my knees
Too many lies I heard in my life
On and on they try to keep as apart
With a distance million miles long

OMG! I'm so fakin fool, I just swimming in lies, how can you be so cruel...

Too many lies
Too many times

Today I felt suffocation
There's something wrong
Misery keeps burning me piece by piece, piece by piece
