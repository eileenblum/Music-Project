Okey! Let's pretend, you and me collide in a subway
We looked at each other, until you disappeared, disappeared

How does it feel to sleep alone
Shadows move and room screams empty
Nightmares and ghosts come true to me
How can I get outta here

Let's pretend we're lovers [4x]

Okey! Let's pretend

Surprise, you yelled to my ear, I lost my focus
I dropped my glasses, and you stepped on them

How does it feel to sleep alone
Shadows move and room screams empty
Nightmares and ghosts come true to me
How can I get outta here

LOVERS! I really hate you!
LOVERS! I really hate you!
LOVERS! I really hate you!
LOVERS! I really hate you!
LOVERS! I really hate you!
HATERS! I really hate you too!!
