We find it difficult to say the words we need to say
So get yourself back down

And pray for the hands of mercy
This is the help you need
Oh come under the shelter of the great I am.

And pray for the hands of mercy

We find it difficult to say the words we really need to say
So get yourself back down
And pray for the hands of mercy
This is the help you need
Oh come under the shelter (of the great I am.)

My wounds are deep enough
Your words are place to hide
But your presence seems to fade away
Lift me back to my sore feet
Lift me back to my sore
