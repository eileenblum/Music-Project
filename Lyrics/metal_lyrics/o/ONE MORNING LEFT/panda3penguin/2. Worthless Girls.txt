Oh God, My God
Behind those sleepin' trees is light
What makes us shine
Your love reflects from the bright blue sky

This temple is on fire
Molded me of clay
So worthless Girls I saw
You turned it all around

You made it worthy
Here's nothing to desire
Golden statues is everything we dream about
We can't understand, we need so much more

Yo! Come on!

These days tried to kill me,
But You drew me above
Fallin' snowflakes hit my eyes
It makes me blind, but what should I see
Is anything here worth it

Seeking the earnest goldmine
Trying to be so satisfied
Turn all Your taps open
Let the living water flow to our hearts
