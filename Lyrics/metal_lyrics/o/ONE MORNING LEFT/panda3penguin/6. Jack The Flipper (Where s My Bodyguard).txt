Flipping elbow,
Rise,

Wo-oooo-o.wo-oooo-o
Lets get this party started [4x]

Rise, Most beautiful day, I ever seen, I create my own love of beauty
You set me free once again

Step a side make your own mind
Bree once again bree once again bree
Make your own mind bree once again free

I wish I had something more to give than myself,
Sometimes I fear it's not enough.
Apathy runs in my veins,
And I want to go down.

This is my worst [2x]
This is my worst nightmare

I wish I had something more to give than myself,
Sometimes I fear it's not enough.
Apathy runs in my veins,
Roses on my grave, breetardead

Everything I have
Everything I have, is not is not.. much.

Everything I have (you set me free) is not much
