Four year strong, four letter lie
If hope dies, her words kill
You give me a sparkle of hope, a second chance.

As silence falls, as we fight, as blood runs black, a skylit drive
A love ends suicide, after the burial

Forever in terror, eyes set to kill.
My son my executioner

Forever in terror, eyes set to kill.
My son my executioner, inked in blood.

Spread the word about us,
This world is ours

Four year strong, four letter lie
If hope dies, her words kill
You give me a sparkle of hope, a second chance.

This is... is... thrust moment

Spread the word,
This world is ours
