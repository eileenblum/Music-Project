1820 â Snake eyes are watching
Cold blood among slaves and death

Voodoo queen of sickened lust
Sleeps aside the dead below
Plantation blues and magical black
Bodies in vain on a burning cross

In the priest form of evil she takes you again and again

In the land of bloodstained cotton
Insects of fire burrows through
When evening falls the light is hiding
And skeletons cry in voodooland

In the purest form of evil she takes you again and again

White witch come forth, love me, lay your thorns on me

Carnage campaign â Snake eyes still watching
Blood smeared on the submissive weak
Her legacy . 2000 tortured and murdered
From deep within the roots of rose hall

Sadistic bitch of gruesome wealth
Lost in her own poisoned world
Angel of death please bring her home
Yeah little mistress! Thy kingdomâs in vain

Annie, sweet Annie, where are you now?

White come forth, love me, lay your thorns on me

Dixieghost, stripped and cold, damage done

Through the eyes of the goat vengeance rules
An entity with an urge to kill
From the world below a queen rise again

Yeah, in the night of hunger she is coming back from hell

White witch come forth, love me, lay your thorns on me
