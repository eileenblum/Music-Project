Why donât you kill me, am I so unpleasant?
Do I really set your mind on fire?
Quiet bitch! Itâs only cuts and bruises
Peace! Your only wound is my love to you
Join me, burn out the sun
Taste me, stay in the dark with me
Shut your mouth! Itâs only cuts and bruises
Peace! Your only fear is being alone

I am alive
At dusk I raise the flag
I am so free
Until dawn nobody knows

Am I the devil you know? Do you despise me?
Do I really turn your life to shit?
Quiet bitch! Itâs only curs and bruises
Peace! Your only wound is my love to you
Infiltrate, letâs turn the night around
Steady stream, no more triviality
Shut your mouth! Itâs only cuts and bruises
Peace! Your only fear is being alone

We are alive
At dusk we raise the flag
We are so free
Until dawn nobody knows

Devilâs harlot
Devilâs harlot
Destined to die with me

You are truly the devil I know, so pleasant, cold and lethal
Iâve tasted you now I waste you too
Peace! Your only wound is being born

We are alive
At dusk we raise the flag
We are so free
At down they bury our flesh
