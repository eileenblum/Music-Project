Eyes of the lost, why do you keep staring at me?
Can you believe? Youâre my favorite fantasy

Heavenly touch, please lie next to me forever
Why look so sad? My severed favorite shiver

Psycho dynamite, got a masterplan
Forever and ever of acid and man

Bloodspattered lies forever
Darkness never dies, no never
Standing on solid gold
My infinite paradise

Dehumanisation through perversity
You turn me on, believe me when I kill you
Dehumanisation through perversity
Dead as you can be I juice you up at the core

Psycho dynamite, got a masterplan
Forever and ever of acid and man

Bloodspattered lies forever
Darkness never dies, no never

Seeds of this world infecting me like a plague
Malevolent intoxication, oh Iâm high on blood

Flesh domination, I conquer through obscurity
Malevolent intoxication, oh, you are mine forever

Eyes of the lost, why do you keep staring at me?
Can you believe? Youâre my favorite fantasy

Psycho dynamite, got a masterplan
Forever and ever of acid and man

Bloodspattered lies forever
Darkness never dies, no never
