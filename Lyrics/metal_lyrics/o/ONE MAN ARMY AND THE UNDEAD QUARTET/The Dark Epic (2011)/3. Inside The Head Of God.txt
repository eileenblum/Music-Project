The night is absolute, death-light lit by fury
Eternally we lay the future in a blind manâs hands
Since the dawn of light and religious mockery
We do all that satan would expect from us

Anger ritual â World sodomy â Dominate! Kill!
The devil brings the mushroom to the table
Annihilate!! Decapitate!!
Raping the light of a new generation
Terrorise!! Demonic rite!!
Into the void we continue in bleeding mode

Oh yeah, storm is ahead â Keeps the dead awake
Zombies walking the sands of the supreme
What have we become?

The answer lies inside the head of god
Judge, jury, executioner
Inside the head of god â Inch by inch â world sodomy

Mind is an open wound, embracing a complete darkness
Reborn in the cold where life means no more than nothing
Women and children screams in critical bloodred confusion
Desert pain increases as the martyr lays the path

Anger ritual â World sodomy â Dominate! Kill!
The devil brings the mushroom to the table
Annihilate!! Decapitate!!
Raping the light of a new generation
Terrorise!! Demonic rite!!
Into the void we continue in bleeding mode

Oh yeah, storm is ahead â Keeps the dead awake
Zombies walking the sands of the supreme
What have we become?

The answer lies inside the head of god
Judge, jury, executioner
Inside the head of god â Inch by inch â world sodomy

Centuries of imprisoning the free and the peaceful
Preaching, separating, justifying corpses of a wrong institution
Forsaken and beaten, circle of death is within out hand
Disciples of the wicked is digging nameless graves in hell

Who am I? Who am I not? Who is god? Who is not?
What am I? What am I not? What is god? What is not?

Hatred and damnation ties up all lose ends
