A child, an innocent doll, an everyday obsession
Forbidden attraction, losing all control
Loving her, embracing her, captivating her

Down, down in the cellar
Find the pleasures of slavery
Bound, gagged and wiped out
Living a nightmare in daddyâs arms

My love, my innocent angel â A mother spreading demonseed
Soft skin so cold, lifeless shiny eyes
Raping her, destroying her, no light for her

Down, down in the cellar
Find the pleasures of slavery
Bound, gagged and wiped out
Living a nightmare in daddyâs arms

Bestial suburban â A loving feather by flesh, blood and violence
In a rats graveyard time stand still as satan takes his toll, yeah

Burn! Burn!
Câmon, hear me!
Burn, Burn, daddy burn!

Youâre my idol, youâre my reaper
Why donât you burn the way I burn?
Master of sin, father of all
I love you still as thick blood never dries up

Down, down in the cellar
Find the pleasures of slavery
Bound, gagged and wiped out
Living a nightmare in daddyâs arms
