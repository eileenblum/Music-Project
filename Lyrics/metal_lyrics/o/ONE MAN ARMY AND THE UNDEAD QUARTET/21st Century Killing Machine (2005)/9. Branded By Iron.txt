Being alive
Or lie dead rotting
Nobody really gives a shit
Throw the dice
And shut the fuck up
Either way you're meeting the book

Yeah, you're next in line
And you're heading for the house of pain
Destined by lies and greed
In the ghetto all over again

We're all branded by iron
The final countdown has begun
Yeah, we're all branded by iron
Make a difference and kill yourself

The road to hell and freedom

Being rich
Or beg in the ditch
Do you wanna die slow or fast?
Start diggin' your hole!
And shut down your heart!
Cause the black rain will soon hit us all

Yeah, you're next in line
And you're heading for the house of pain
Destined by lies and greed
In the ghetto all over again

We're all branded by iron
The final countdown has begun
Yeah, we're all branded by iron
Make a difference and kill yourself

The road to liberation

Machinegun Joe walking tall
Shooting friends and family down
Mad unrecognizable human deeds
Blood runs inside the flames of hell

Men are falling like leaves
The process of extinction

Yeah, you're next in line
And you're heading for the house of pain
Destined by lies and greed
In the ghetto all over again

We're all branded by iron
The final countdown has begun
Yeah, we're all branded by iron
Make a difference and kill yourself

The road to hell and freedom
Liberation
Celebration
Oh yeah!
