What's going on in the woods behind your sleep?
Do you see? Do you dare to see?
Day walkers in a constant darkness
Trembling thoughts as the jackal's conceiving

The devil's rising one more time
Dead moon over Bethlehem

Good old Nick is etching through your skin
"Pleasuring" your inner soul

"From the eternal sea he rises
Creating armies on either shores
Turning man against his brother
Till man exists no more"

No hope but the freedoms dope
Abandon the mighty and the holy
No hope but the freedoms rope
Turn off the lights - the end of the line

What's going on in the woods behind the church?
Everyone knows, yet no one seems to know
A bizarre incident - infiltration of the blackened gift
Awake but still not, adapting to a new world order

The devil's rising one more time
Dead moon over Bethlehem

What's going on in the woods behind the church?
Nobody knows, nobody dares to know
A bizarre incident in the wilderness of black
All night long, all day short

The devil's rising one more time
Dead moon over Bethlehem
