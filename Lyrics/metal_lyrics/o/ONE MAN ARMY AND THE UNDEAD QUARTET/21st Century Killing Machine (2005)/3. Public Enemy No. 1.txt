You think you are on top
Against all odds you've made it
But life ain't that easy baby
Death is giving you a fright

In the mist of the night
A lot of commotion is spread
Someone is diggin' the graves
Someone's preparing murder

One of these days, mark my words
A demon in neon will flash your eyes
Public enemy no. 1 will fuck with your head
Forever and ever, nothing is never

Young and wasted
Too blind to see this mess
Stabbed and stabbed again
Do the star shine that bright?

I've ride the rollercoaster
Still got nothing to prove
Still don't give a shit!!
Cause the fire still burns

One of these days, mark my words
A demon in neon will flash your eyes
Public enemy no. 1 will fuck with your head
Forever and ever, nothing is never

I'm the devil in disguise
Ready for the golden rebirth
The devil in disguise
Ready for some piece of the action
A one man army
Crushing all in my way, oh yeah

I am satan from hell
And you mean nothing to me
I am satan from hell
Tomorrow I'll fuck you up

[Solo]

One of these days, mark my words
A demon in neon will flash your eyes
Public enemy no. 1 will fuck with your head
Forever and ever...

One of these days, mark my words
A demon in neon will flash your eyes
Public enemy no. 1 will fuck with your head
Forever and ever, nothing is never
