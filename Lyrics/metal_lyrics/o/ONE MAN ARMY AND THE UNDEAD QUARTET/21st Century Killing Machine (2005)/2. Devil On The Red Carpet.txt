Nights grow dim
I'm soakin' wet and afraid
A loaded might
Heading towards my innocence
Diggin' my foxhole
Hiding from what can't be hid from
The fright is so bright
It burrows through my brain

I'm gods favourite child 'ya know
Like dump I'm hading for the pit

A black tank in my sight
Is it the devil or jehova mighty?
Fuelled on fury
Searching, destroying, breeding the dead

I'm gods favourite child 'ya know
Like dump I'm hading for the pit

Love and romance, just a dream in the shadow of Christ
Devil on the red carpet singing out the pleasures of sin
Lust and freedom, frozen in this winter home of hell
Stuck in a void where dead bodies hold me warm

Nights grow dim
I'm soakin' wet and afraid
A loaded might
Heading towards my innocence
Diggin' my foxhole
Hiding from what can't be hid from
The fright is so bright
It burrows through my brain

I'm gods favourite child 'ya know
Like dump I'm hading for the pit

Love and romance, just a dream in the shadow of Christ
Devil on the red carpet singing out the pleasures of sin
Lust and freedom, frozen in this winter home of hell
Stuck in a void where dead bodies hold me warm

Deep within my soldier mind a ghost appears
It's you in a white dress, dead like me

Time - time for the wicked
Now it's time - yeah, time for the wicked

To ravish your souls

I'm gods favourite child 'ya know
Like dump I'm hading for the pit

Love and romance, just a dream in the shadow of Christ
Devil on the red carpet singing out the pleasures of sin
Lust and freedom, frozen in this winter home of hell
Stuck in a void where dead bodies hold me warm
