Over your shoulders
They're breathing down your neck
So cold and deceiving
Crusade of christian perversions
Heaven's ejection
We're the free and afflicting ones
With a burning mind apart
Empty and shattered souls

You put my heart in darkness
You made the sky turn black
You made hell, you made me
Abusing amusement down the dumps

Revolution in progress
Worldwide devastation unfolds
Destroying what that dog has "built"
The hatred turns on christ
Black souls outnumbered
Still getting stronger and stronger
Let's show those fuckers we're made of steel
And we take no shit!!!

You put my heart in darkness
Now it's payback time
Freedom in the black society
Storm of hatred

When darkness comes to town
Feel it in your bones baby
As we stand and as we fight
The power of the mind relieves this pain

Relieves this pain

Fall into the dirt of truth
Avenge the bitter peace
Dance on the face of the holy
Lady in white so helpless in red

So helpless in red

Feel it coming
Guiding you through the rough times
It's bigger than god

[Solo]

When hatred comes to life - it comes to take control
Piece by piece we take control - when hatred comes to life
When hatred comes to life - like an angel from above
We shall all live again!!!

This is the way of the real world
My empire of dirt grows warm in my heart
It all comes down to survival
Living through hatred to achieve your love
