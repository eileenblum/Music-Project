Seven years of sterility, I was the puppet of malignant divinity
Engaged by rules and rats, the factory slime was powdering my mind
Salvation was beyond reach, reading death on the menu
This breakdown of mine made even bitterness flee reality

From the day you're born death is just around the corner
Follows your every step - the sweetness of black

[Solo]

Was this his wish, this hell of pain, pushin' me thin in the name of god
With machines grinding love, I was lost in paradise
But as I looked up at the burning sky the darkness started feeding me
It was the call of the wild - a restart in self esteem

From the day you're born death is just around the corner
Follows your every step - the sweetness of black

[Solo]

I feel dead but the tunnel of light I see not
I feel bad, yes the pleasures are there for me to take

I feel dead but the tunnel of light I see not
I feel bad, yes the pleasures are there for me to take

[Solo]

'Cause I'm a livewire on the rocks
Livewire on the rocks
Livewire on the rocks
Livewire on the rocks
Livewire on the rocks
Livewire on the rocks
