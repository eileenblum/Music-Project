We've got unfinished business you and I
Yeah, something is stalking your head
Find it, tear it down, inhale it's prophecy
Release the steel that lies behind the seal

You need this, c'mon and stand on your own two feet
You've dreamt it, make it real
You're the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
You're the love, true love at the midnight hour

Steady as a rock, smiling with blood in my hands
It feels so good watching the wasteland grow
Yeah, it pounds my head real hard, you're right my love
This sweet pain makes me do it no other way

You need this, c'mon and stand on your own two feet
You've dreamt it, make it real
You're the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
You're the love, true love at the midnight hour

The midnight hour
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight - the midnight hour

Yeah, with no apparent motive I snatch the lives of you
Good deed immunity - a madman living his dream

[Solo]

With only death in mind I make you disappear
And as I ride the universe no one conquers my fall

[Solo]

I need this, c'mon see me stand on my own two feet
I've dreamt it, now it's real
I'm the monster, the monster of all raging monsters
I'm the love, true love at the midnight hour

The midnight hour

Love and hate 'til death do us part
