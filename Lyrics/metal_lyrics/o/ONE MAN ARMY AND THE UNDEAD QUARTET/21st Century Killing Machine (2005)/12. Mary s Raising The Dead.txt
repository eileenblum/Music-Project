Damaged lives
With two evil eyes they stare at me
Stone cold stupidity
Whores of a better tomorrow?

Liquid babe on their tongues
Sick become ill
Brats and rats everywhere
Am I supposed to owe you for this fucked up shit?

Disturbing the priest
The way I have preached in my free speech of choice
Raging pit-bull of the leach
Violators on ground zero

Impressing, depressing
Role model rebel gets burned
This touch of hysteria
Closing my cage to total solitude

Hail Mary full of shit

Deep within the circle of life
Mary's raising the dead
Within the innocence an purity
Mary's raising the dead
Spawn of Satan marches into glory
As Mary's raising the dead
Close within the circle of life
Mary's raising the dead

No bright light, the infinity is absolute black
A hard day's pain, long days of nightmare fades
A lot of fuckin' turbulence, emotions no sweet
A volcanic promotion cutting my throat wide open

The dog was looking down, infesting my nest
I pleaded to be left alone, without you and him
I did my thing but the retards were eating me alive
Dizzy and confused I marched into darkness

Slave to the system
Longing for deaths hand
Funeral rebirth
You sons of bitches I will travel in your minds

You don't know what sorrows you've enclosed
You choked me, now I choke you, feel it coming bitch
Yeah, face the mirror you accident of god, ghost of me
Get ready to run downhill, I'll be waiting for you

Deep within the circle of life
Mary's raising the dead
Within the innocence an purity
Mary's raising the dead
Spawn of Satan marches into glory
As Mary's raising the dead
Close within the circle of life
Mary's raising the dead
