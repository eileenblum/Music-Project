So many times so rough
A 44 against an empty cell
Can I get any lower?
Someone's preventing passion
Why can't I feel joy?
Marked by natures choice
Early morning bleeding
Someone's preventing me

No more
Standing in the shades
No more
24/7 misery

Standing on a silver plate
Burning and still you throw gasoline
Increasing this pain I so "deserve"
But I'm stronger than you
In fire I'm going against the grain
Do you feel threatened punk!?
Hey! I do what the fuck I wanna do
None of you will see the world as I do

No more
Standing in the shades
I am
V.i.p. no longer low
24/7 misery
oh yeah!
You've got that right! Hell is for heroes

Cold blood keeps poring down
Way down satisfaction bounds

No more
Standing in the shades
I am
V.i.p. no longer low
24/7 misery
oh yeah!
You've got that right! Hell is for heroes

Heroes
Heroes
Heroes live
