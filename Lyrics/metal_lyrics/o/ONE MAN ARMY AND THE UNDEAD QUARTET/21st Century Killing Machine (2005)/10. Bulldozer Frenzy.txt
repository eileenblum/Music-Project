I'm under attack
This sickness is reaching for me
It's getting under my skin
This insect must be terminated

Yeah, I like you better dead
You demon off the leach
And as the rotted flesh is aging
This world is getting nicer

So don't question my motive
You're the reason I fucked up
Don't question this mayhem
You're the reason of anger
Unleashed and justified
Bulldozer Frenzy
Over and over again

I'm so confused
A loud noise penetrating my ears
This virus is killing my brain
Mutha fucka die!!

Yeah, I like you better dead
You demon of the leach
And now as I piss on your grave
This world is getting nicer

So don't question my motive
You're the reason I fucked up
Don't question this mayhem
You're the reason of anger
Unleashed and justified
Bulldozer Frenzy
Over and over again
