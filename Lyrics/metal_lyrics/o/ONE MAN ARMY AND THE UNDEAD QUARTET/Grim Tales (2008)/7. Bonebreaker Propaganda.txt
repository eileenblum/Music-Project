Death to all
Dictatorship divinity is ravishing the land
Sacrifice
For nothing you follow his glorious self centered ways
Patriotic fire
Killing anti enemy
Robots unleashed
Mind controlled and ready to serve

Yeah
I will see you marching down in hell

Bonebreaker
We're at war
To die for something we don't know
Propaganda
To be dead
In action we develop high
Status stars
But in the end as the cards are laid in solitude
We fade away
In the ditch
The blade has brought the angel forth

Bloodstained cross
The victoriously insane
Is just another hypocrite to me
Inside the flames
We've got one direct order to generate into ash
Twisted aggressions
Burned brain, last stop
Final attack
The last ones are dug down this rotten soil

Yeah
I will see you marching down in hell

Bonebreaker
We're at war
To die for something we don't know
Propaganda
To be dead
In action we develop
High status stars
But in the end as the cards are laid in solitude
We fade away
In the ditch
The blade has brought the angel forth

Bonebreaker propaganda

We just wanna live in peace and silence
But the strings are pulled
The wicked comes knocking on the door
You get blinded in the fields
For your country you wipe out all including you
No questions asked, no emotions in motion
This age of darkness rise and
Dead flesh surrounds an equal dead
Devastation builds his confidence
Listen to the lies
Make this country stand

I will see you marching down in hell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
I will see you crawling down in hell

Bonebreaker
We're at war
To die for something we don't know
Propaganda
To be dead
In action we develop
High status stars
But in the end as the cards are laid in solitude
We fade away
In the ditch
The blade has brought the angel forth
