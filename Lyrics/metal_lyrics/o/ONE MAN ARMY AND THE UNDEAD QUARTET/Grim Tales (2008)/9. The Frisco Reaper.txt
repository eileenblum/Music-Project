Nightfall
Souls of the city are bleeding inside
Death roll
Perishing messengers is breathing your air
Virus attack
The ritual of crime is the cancer of joy
Devil's anarchy
Burning and yearning for termination

Trash and filth
On a jungle raid
It's a quest for pain
Walls are closing in
Time to draw that piece
The thrill of the kill

Shoot

Big bang
Magnum force
Street cleaner
Blows your head clean off
Death wish
Make my day
Bullets over Frisco is shining up the night

Dark world
Innocent victims infected by plague
Withering throne
Burden of new age is reigning in chaos
Pleading and bleeding
Living through pain
All hope seems to be gone
Punks and ruins
Seven day crime wave
Is cutting deep wounds

Trash and filth
On a jungle raid
It's a quest for pain
Walls are closing in
Time to draw that piece
The thrill of the kill

Shoot

Big bang
Magnum force
Street cleaner
Blows your head clean off
Death wish
Make my day
Bullets over Frisco is shining up the night

Resistance ha
It's pointless to resist
Silent night
They slit your throat while you sleep

Fallen pieces of 3 to 5
Increasing the void of the spectacular
But time is ticking
The lucky sad gains the sun again
Concrete pirates
Staring at the eyes of liberty

Big bang
Magnum force
Street cleaner
Blows your head clean off
Death wish
Make my day
Bullets over Frisco is shining up the night
