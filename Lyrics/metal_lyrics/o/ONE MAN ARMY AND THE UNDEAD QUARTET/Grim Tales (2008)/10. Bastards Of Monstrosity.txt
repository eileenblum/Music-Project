Enter the ride of your life
The passion of brutality and suffering
Uniforms drained in blood
They're smiling and they celebrate in violence
Naked in the jungle heat
Lying, dying, rotting in the river of red
Embryos on a wicked path
Growing on a graveyard of a twisted rage

Scorched
Rage of nothingness
Torched
Entangled in shellshock paradise

Yeah, it's the end
The end of all beautiful
It's alive, it's alive
The spawning of demon seed
It's the end, it's the end
The end of all beautiful
It's alive, it's alive
The spawning of demon seed

Exit this sickening art
Walk the ways of disturbia and eternal hell
Devils and rotting pigs
Heating up the engine in this haven dream
Bloody sanctuary
Soldiers of death are pushing Satan to the future
Warfare of forever and ever
The dead spreads the genes of mind melting terror

Scorched
Rage of nothingness
Torched
Entangled in shellshock paradise

Yeah, it's the end
The end of all beautiful
It's alive, it's alive
The spawning of demon seed
It's the end, it's the end
The end of all beautiful
It's alive, it's alive
The spawning of demon seed

Pay the price it's what you've got to do
Pay the price, engage the primitive
Pay the price it's what you've got to do
Pay that fuckin' price

Death is here to stay
It grabs you by the balls
Sick is breeding sick
Bastards of monstrosity
