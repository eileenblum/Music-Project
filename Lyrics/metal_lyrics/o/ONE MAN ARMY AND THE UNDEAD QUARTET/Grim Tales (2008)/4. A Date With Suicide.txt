Hey little girl
What have you done to yourself?
Innocence torn by greed
And ravishing purple rain
From sheltered years
Comes raw and heavy duty
The condemned revels in sin
And camera flash

The genocide of blonde ambition races on
Maximum torture of the young and weak and lost
Snowblind queen of mountain high is dancing free
Parental advisory drawn to cash

She's got a date with suicide
Hungry maggots urging for her flesh
It's a feast on the funeral agenda
Dear beloved icon leaves this world in total collapse

Watch her
Take a look at the new sensation
Touch her
And make that thin ice break
Love her
Day and night as cash is king
Kill her
This you already did
Watch her
Take a look at the new sensation
Touch her
And make that thin ice break
Love her
Day and night as cash is king
Kill her
This you already did

Hey little bitch
Is this the best that you can do?
Number one is cracking up
In laughter and psychosis
Hiding in the dark
Playing the song of her life
The sound of luxury
Echoes in filth and death

The genocide of blonde ambition races on
Maximum torture of the young and weak and lost
Snowblind queen of mountain high is dancing free
Parental advisory drawn to cash

She's got a date with suicide
Hungry maggots urging for her flesh
It's a feast on the funeral agenda
Dear beloved icon leaves this world in total collapse

Glamorous world of darkness
Slaves of desire in need of more and more
Flesh

She's got a date with suicide
Hungry maggots urging for her flesh
It's a feast on the funeral agenda
Dear beloved icon leaves this world in total collapse

Watch her
Take a look at the new sensation
Touch her
And make that thin ice break
Love her
Day and night as cash is king
Kill her
This you already did
Watch her
Take a look at the new sensation
Touch her
And make that thin ice break
Love her
Day and night as cash is king
Kill her
This you already did
