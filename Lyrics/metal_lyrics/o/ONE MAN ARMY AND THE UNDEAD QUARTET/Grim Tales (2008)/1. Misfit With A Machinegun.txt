Born deranged
The first step of this heavenly gift
Lost in abuse
As the pounding noise is ripping his ears

You are not like those insects of poison
Human waste, punish parasite religion

Social disorder
Falling down the abyss of pain
Blackened confusion
Psychosis taking over the mind

Take their lives cause God is telling you
Wipe them out cause they wanna hurt us

Zero functioning brain activity

Black clouds over Summerville
Slaughterhouse mania
Killing groove and machinegun fire
Take that son of a bitch down

Soldier of horror
A sociopath to serve and protect
Army intelligence
All the beautiful now ugly and dead

Take their lives cause God is telling you
Wipe them out cause they wanna hurt us

Zero functioning brain activity

Black clouds over Summerville
Slaughterhouse mania
Killing groove and machinegun fire
Take that son of a bitch down

Down

Black clouds over Summerville
Slaughterhouse mania
Killing groove and machinegun fire
Take that son of a bitch down
Black clouds over Summerville
Slaughterhouse mania
Killing groove and machinegun fire
Take that son of a bitch down
