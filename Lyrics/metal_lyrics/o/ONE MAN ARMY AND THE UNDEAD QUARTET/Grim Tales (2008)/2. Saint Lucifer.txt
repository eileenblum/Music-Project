Ill Capitano
An anti social psychopathic savage
A rock n roll soldier in the name of Satan

Young and fierce
And with black eyes of death
No reaction, only alcoholic action
With no discretion
The spit and the piss
Washes Christ's body and soul

Saint Lucifer
Obey the talk and do the walk
Pushed into the corner of the dark
Saint Lucifer
Of failure and rape comes the demon forth
Make no mistake
The bloodshed has just begun

Rebel with hatred
In the house of the holy
He is a king of fictional reality
Where there's no law

Young and fierce
And with black eyes of death
No reaction, only alcoholic action
With no regrets
He puts your head on a plate
No salvation for the weak and the innocent

Saint Lucifer
Obey the talk and do the walk
Pushed into the corner of the dark
Saint Lucifer
Of failure and rape comes the demon forth
Make no mistake
The bloodshed has just begun

Shattered civilians
Staring at the eyes of a cursed individual
They're bleeding in the chapel
As the final shooting ends their prayers
It's the dawn of Satan's love for youth gone wild

Young and fierce
And with black eyes of death
No reaction, only alcoholic action
With no regrets
He puts your head on a plate
No salvation for the weak and the innocent

Saint Lucifer
Obey the talk and do the walk
Pushed into the corner of the dark
Saint Lucifer
Of failure and rape comes the demon forth
Make no mistake
Saint Lucifer has come for you
