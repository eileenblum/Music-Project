And their naked bodies fall to the ground
It's a cold, cold death solution
Their screams vanish up in smoke
High might of perverted evil

Yeah, they know how you feel it
When your body is shaking
Yeah, they know how to end you
But do they know that the dead comes back?
Generations of vengeance
Warfare remembrance
Yeah, they will know how you felt it
The true meaning of agony

Make them die slowly
Forsaken
Push them to the chamber

Slaves and whores, bred to die
Millions of lowlifes begging for salvation
Shattered in the failure of the system
The reaper is your closest friend

Yeah, they know how you feel it
When your body is shaking
Yeah, they know how to end you
But do they know that the dead comes back?
Generations of vengeance
Warfare remembrance
Yeah, they will know how you felt it
The true meaning of agony

Make them die slowly
Forsaken
Push them to the chamber
Deathbound
Make them die slowly
Lowlife
Do you love the pain?

All your civil rights are crushed
And moulded to ashes
Yesterday's golden boy

Do you see the ghost
In your dreams that is you?
Lives in vain on a pile of shit

Forsaken souls
Are gathered in the waiting
Yesterday's finest challenge

Time to let go and let the future
Await those of the dark
The future tell no lies

Give me some more fucking pain

Yeah, they know how you feel it
When your body is shaking
Yeah, they know how to end you
But do they know that the dead comes back?
Generations of vengeance
Warfare remembrance
Yeah, they will know how you felt it
The true meaning of agony

Make them die slowly
Forsaken
Push them to the chamber
Deathbound
Make them die slowly
Lowlife
Do you love the pain?
