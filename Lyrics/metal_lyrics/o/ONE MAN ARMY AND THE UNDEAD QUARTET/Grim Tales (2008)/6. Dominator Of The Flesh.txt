Those who stand high and mighty
Those from money, those from greed
They throw you down the pit of fate
Fear and drama, hear the people roar

We're entering heaven tonight
We're crashing through the pearly gate

Lady Red Rose, his loyal right hand
Butchered flesh, digging hard in her eyes
Death comes fast on the arena of champs
As her shiny thorns lightens the muscle fight

We're entering heaven tonight
We're crashing through the pearly gate

Spill the blood
Again and again

Gladiators march for death
With blood on their hands and hatred in mind
Armed to the fucking core
Swords and spears blackens all human bonds

Murdering son of a bitch
I see you in hell
Weak son of terror
Come eye to eye
Eye to eye
Murdering son of a bitch
I see you in hell
Weak son of terror
Come eye to eye
Again and again

Gladiators unto the march of doom
Survival comes hard as the beast takes it all
Stand by your own fearless being
And prepare to be slain by superior power

Those who stand high and mighty
Those from money, those from greed
They throw you down the pit of fate
Fear and drama, hear the people roar

We're entering heaven tonight
We're crashing through the pearly gate

Dominator of the flesh
