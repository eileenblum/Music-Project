They're baptized in fire, aging in the flames
By the lies they live, don't know any different
Protecting what they've learned, raising the AK-47
10 years old, yet 20 kill and still counting

4 wall lockdown, closed to others not pure
Zero tolerance, the ones opposed no longer breathes
Bright light in dark Heaven, kids of a new century
War of forever, brainwashed to maximum reality

Listen to the words, feel them! Live them!
This is your path, follow it by heart
Make your daddy proud and strong"
