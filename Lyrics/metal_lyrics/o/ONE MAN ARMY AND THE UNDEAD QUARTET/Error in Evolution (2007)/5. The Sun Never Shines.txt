Can you hear it? The silence beyond the trees and hillsDeeper than ever the forest hides that praying and that useless moaningStill she puts her faith in god that eventually will freeze her blood Yeah, there's a place in my head where the sun never shinesIt's cold and it's dark and it's feeding on meThey say when you die you see a lightBut that is not true cause in hell everything is black Can you see it? The carrier of the devil's toolStabbing that plague, that virus that breaks down the wings of an angelA child, a daughter of cruelty is found dead in the snow Yeah, there's a place in my head where the sun never shinesIt's cold and it's dark and it's feeding on meThey say when you die you see a lightBut that is not true cause in hell everything is black The sun never shines on me My child is sick, she needs to be taken care of nowMy mind is telling me that satan lives in herBeating her everyday, still need to beat some moreI medicate her as she stares at me with broken vision They say that when you die you see a lightBut that is not true cause in hel everything is black
