So quiet, the fuckers are bombing no more
Covered with ashes and blood, I rise to see the end
The future is now, past and presence - All burning
Am I the last one alive? What will become of me?

One last trail leading through death and destruction
Guided by the flesh in fire - Can this really be the way?
Terror is speaking my name - Join the nightmare my friend!
But determined I walk the path of no life...

Searching for a will to live but I cannot find it!

This is horror!
This is terror!
Why doesn't everything go away?
This is madness!
The way of pain
One man alone to start again

This is horror
This is terror

They're playing with me - Why am I still breathing?
And that voiceagain saying that I'm just a ghost of another life
I refuse to believe as the road gets thinner and thinner
They struck us hard, wiped us out, all but me

Oh god please help me!

This is horror!
This is terror!
Why doesn't everything go away?
This is madness!
The way of pain
One man alone to start again

This is horror
This is terror
I go down on my knees ready to bite the bullet
And there she is, the most beautiful thing in the world
Come to me my love, she says, as I walk into the witches arms
She's my darling of the deep, the creature to kiss me dead

Nightmare!
Nightmare in ashes and blood

This is horror!
This is terror!
Why doesn't everything go away?
This is madness!
The way of pain
One man alone to start again

This is horror
This is terror
