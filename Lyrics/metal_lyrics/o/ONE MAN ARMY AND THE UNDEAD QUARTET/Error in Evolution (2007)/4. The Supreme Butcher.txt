I woke up in the mud, naked with a grin on my teethWith the chainsaw engine running still in my handsThe continual burning, a desire to kill a few moreBloody Mary morning caffein rush I'm still on the looseGot a price on my headBut can you fuckin' touch me?Invisible psycho onto the stars It's getting close to midnight; the venue is screaming my namePlaytime foreplay action, I begin to fantasizeAfterparty sugar overdose, loving the bitches fleshDeath came fast tonight, let's do it again Yeah, I'm still on the looseGot a price on my headBut can you fuckin' touch me?Invisible psycho onto the stars I am the supreme butcherHunting you down in the dark Kill her!Kill her!Kill her!KILL!!!!!!
