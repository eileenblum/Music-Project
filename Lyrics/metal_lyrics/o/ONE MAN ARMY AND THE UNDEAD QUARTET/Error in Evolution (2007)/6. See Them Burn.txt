I see them burn, those witches aboveIn that white clothing they fool no oneThere are no angels, nor no saintsFor what purpose should they exist? Sin after sin, yeah, our hands are always so dirty See them burnIn hell where we all belongSee them burnAnd suffer in the fire below All the good things are evil misleadsBreeding the ones to keep spreading that cancerYeah, I accept the fact that we're all aimed for hellWe all burn as a family of dark secrets and guilt Sin after sin, yeah, our hands are always so dirty See them burnIn hell where we all belongSee them burnAnd suffer in the fire below All that cleansing versus heavy consciousWorld hits rock bottom as the preacher gives total absolutionKilling everyone, destroying everythingI wonder how long it takes until all the flesh burns in the abyss of the damned See them burnIn hell where we all belongSee them burnAnd suffer in the fire below
