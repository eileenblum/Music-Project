Been dead for so many years
But alive in me since 30 back
Way up in the neon lights
Again I claim my right as the one

Got blue suede shoes
Gonna set the night on fire
Old but still shining gold
C'mon you fucks!!

Hail the king!
Hail the one that lives in me still
Hail the king
Hail! Hail! Hail!

Reborn in Satan from hell
Let's see in a day or two
When a million faces look up
'Cause legends don't stop walking the earth

Got blue suede shoes
Gonna set the night on fire
Old but still shining gold
C'mon you fucks!!

Hail the king!
Hail the one that lives in me still
Hail the king
Hail! Hail! Hail!
