This paradiseThis hell which you all call homeFilled with plastic beautyWhere death is glory - The hookers denThese bloodred streetsWhere the cloud casts a shadowAnd that definite darknessRoll of the rich man He's a collector of ghosts Devil man - schizophrenic hot loving manHe bears the burden of satan's toyCause heaven knows no pain Heaven knows no painHeaven knows no pain Within the mindOf loneliness and broken thoughtsThe good and the badEating each other up, the hole's getting biggerObsessive violenceHunting beauties downSavage rampageThe demon's fucking them to death Devil man - schizophrenic hot loving manHe bears the burden of satan's toyCause heaven knows no pain Heaven knows no painHeaven knows no pain -  I didn't wanna do it, trust me, I really didn't wannaBut tasting her flesh made me more certain than ever Romance in the reapers nest, A place if no recoveryThe man of the dark makes love in motel 666 - I really wanted to do it, trust me, I really really wantedOtherwise the bitches wouldn't stop haunting me in those wet dreams - This is my heaven and heaven is good
