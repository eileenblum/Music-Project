Late that night I saw the preacher and the
lovely nurse shattered at the end of the line
Yeah, I am he and your are him, I am the one
That's gonna take away the sunshine for the people

No, don't you mess around
I have something for your eyes
Have you ever seen the cross cracked in two
Watch me shake that balance of yours

It's mine for the taking
I have it in the palm of my hand
Yeah, it's mine for the taking
Tonight I'm gonna show you what it's all about

From that day I saw that God was putting
too much effort in putting me down
But not like this, I am strong and that is probably
why I'm still around the show

No, don't you mess around
I have something for your eyes
Have you ever seen the cross cracked in two
Watch me shake that balance of yours

It's mine for the taking
I have it in the palm of my hand
Yeah, it's mine for the taking
Tonight I'm gonna show you what it's all about

It's mine for the taking
It's mine for the taking
It's mine for the taking
It's mine for the taking
Tonight I'm gonna show you what it's all about!

Born in Heaven, I am aging against the wind
My blood, sweat and tears reveals my haven
I just want what every man deserves and needs
A glorious illusion, but in my case real

No, don't you mess around
I have something for your eyes
Have you ever seen the cross cracked in two
Watch me shake that balance of yours

It's mine for the taking
I have it in the palm of my hand
Yeah, it's mine for the taking
Tonight I'm gonna show you what it's all about

Mine!
It's mine for the taking
