Hear me O! Ageless Father!
Draw your shadowed sword
Forged in the black fire, unseen!
Meant to put an end to cosmic lies
Let the false fate perish in your Storm
Usher the children of the black flame

I fixate my mind
In the void of nihility
Drawing the blessed Sigil
I meditate on its reflection

Now I offer you my prayer
Bringer of death to the cosmos
Hinderer of the messianic delusion
The Tower of Nihiliferâs wrath

By my rotten ancient tongue,
I utter the awakening formula
Sworn to unleash the soreness
To weaken the pillars of existence

O! Ruler of Ghagiel!
Awaken through my prayer
Dethrone the demiurge,
Turn this prison asunder

To witness this victory
I am sworn to the holy emptiness
Forming a pact with the Lord
To cast death upon spiritual diseases

Confine the creation neath the shadow of wisdom
Blood drips writing this tale
This clay formed body is the book

Conjuring the prayer of my Lord Beelzebuth!
Spiritual journey begins
Till I hear the holy Silent Scream!
