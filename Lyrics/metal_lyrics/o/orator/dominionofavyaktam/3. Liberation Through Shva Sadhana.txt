Shva Sadhana [4x]

Seeing the life and its sorrow
Urged to escape from this prison
At the Smashana I would find,
Boon of a thoughtless existence!
To cut the clothing of karma!
Atoned to the voiceless voice
Asana of a fresh corpse
Woundless corpse of a warrior

I have seen the unseen!
Dreadful yet blissful!
Trapped inside this circle
I have made to conjure

Suddenly nothing
No more light, no sound
All I see before me isâ¦
The blazing eye of wisdom

Conjuring, Chanting, Summoning,
Praising, Offering, Worshiping

Astral funeral pyre
Abode of the Primal Shakti!
The mind is the Adya Pith!
Gnostic contemplation

Now I see the corpse has spoken in the divine tongue to grant my liberation!

Shva Sadhana [4x]
