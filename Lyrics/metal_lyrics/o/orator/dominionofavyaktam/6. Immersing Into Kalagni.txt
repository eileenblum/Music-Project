Conscious pain at the moment of bleak!
Cut it deep and yer wounds shall speak!
Blood from yer Pasavic deeds
Ancient wombâs rotten seedsâ¦

Yer failure has gifted ye a prison
Never shall ye receive the bliss
Nectar of gnosis, within and without
Sleep beneath the muddy universe

Write the drama to manifest
Rotten ways to the womb and back
Begins a thousand rebirths
Neath the dualities of false self!

Imprisoned within flesh and bones
The edifice of the incomplete
Even the cosmos cries for freedom,
The Manusya are to be banished.

Black, devouring Bindu opens
See the cosmos ummanifests
Submerging to its Abyssal fate
The karma of creation thus completes.

Then the Jagat succumbs to Kalagni
To merge with the One who is no-one
