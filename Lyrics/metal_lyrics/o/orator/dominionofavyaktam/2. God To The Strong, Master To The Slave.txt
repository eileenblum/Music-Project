Echoes of the creation are diseases to me!
Manifested from yer makerâs lascivious dreams
Denial of the primordial Divine Black Flame,
Makes ye a pawn inside this demiurgic realm

Impudence to knowledge
Binds ye to yer cage
The essence lies entrapped
Inside yer flesh &amp; bone

Witness the spiritual defiance of deceit!
Behold the Gnosis that is ever concealed!

The sins had set their courses
Made out of stones of grief
Bolted to the elements!
Realized only through tapasya

Arachnid unites ye
To her cobweb of misery
A freedom through nightmares
Drink her venomous elixir 

I am the shadow yet I bear the torch
To light up yer silent souls
Why, then yer thoughts deny?
The notion of yer false existence!

Bring me yer prayers,
I answer in secret!
I reside within ye!
For, I am theâ¦

God to the Strong, Master to the Slave!

Now prayâ¦

Enlighten us, redeem us,
Unchain us,
From rebirth
