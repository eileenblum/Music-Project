âAmay shastro de, paaper slok path kori
Ghrinar pujari, Tahader Ghrina kori
Amay astro de, nijeke shesh kori
Ghrinar pujari, Tahader Ghrina koriâ

How long shall ye hide yer fucking face?
In the fear of this futile existence
Leaping life in the circle of rebirth
Preaching sermons of confusion
Making pawn out of feeble clay-born
That makes me a fucking misanthrope!

Anti-Human, I am Anti-Creation,
Anti-Demiurge, I am Anti-Existence.

What ye have is an astral disease
Twisted corpses entrapping souls
Minds that ye possess are so empty
Inner Cosmic lies reign there
I renounce ye from my thoughts
Proclaim to be dead to this world!

Abusive prayers are rejected
Uttering ominous creeds
Path to become the Azothan
Beyond the void of no return

And, the eleven self-inflicted scars
On my left arm Glorify the names
Of the Eleven Godheads of Alogos!

One with the scourge of nihility,
Unseen through the mortal eyes,
Ye are not of our bloodline
So thereâs no scope to sympathize

Rite of the grand renunciation [4x]
