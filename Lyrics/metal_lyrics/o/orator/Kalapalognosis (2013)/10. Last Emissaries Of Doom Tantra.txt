Within the breath of cosmos
Sleeps the four faced dreamer
Incest in nature and callous
Mean godform of entrapment

Whether to smoke or to reject
This ego chillum that sprung forth

Harvests he seeds and reaps out clays
Not that he ever tried the best
But failure is a mocking so beloved
That a room full of golems was born

Then created the thoughtless one
Stone in one hand and water in other
Merging two in utter trance
The black Savitur was unleashed
We were only born then
Adorned with human bones
Hatched out of eternal eggs
Three eyed pests of anti-dogmas

Keep in mind as a hideous blister
None but the masters of mockery
Maybe ready for the rite of beheading
And thus we retain our sthagayati

The cost is martyr of the flesh
We inherit this leprosy as gift,
And become the leper in time,
Ashes smeared upon us emissaries
Last of us, scribing the monikersâ¦

â¦Of Doomtantra.

Maybe
Our heartless bodies are fed with filths
Eyes, brightened with the antinomy of Yoga,
But, thereâre no offerings to appease
The mean godform of entrapment
