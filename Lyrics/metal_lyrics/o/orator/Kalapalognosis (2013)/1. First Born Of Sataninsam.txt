Deep in the night
I see this Vision
Of how I came to be
Through gnostic copulation

I was born from the venom sperm
Wretched heir to Satanachesh
Hungry to bend the law and see
What becomes of a spoiled godseed?
The easiest escape would be
To run and hide behind flesh
Rather Iâd turn to skeletal dust
And blend within the black soil

First born of Sataninsam

I was to kill for a greater cause
Spilled blood to taste and offer
Thus I became the death bringer
Dancing in gnostic intoxication
With this skull attached to me
I have known to sever the ties
Had I been put to their filthy test?
I gained this key through sacrifice

Come see this castle Iâve built
An act of commemoration
Resembling the very vision
The fortress lies underneath
Shielded by apostasy
Overshadowing Malkuth
Ravaged by pain and hate
Yet I thrive to overcome
The clay formed finite self
I was not a human born
Rather tâwas a deception
As I sprung out of Eveâs womb

First born of Sataninsam

The castle is now open to the One
I see at the twilight of my dream
A winged Mistress mighty, eloquent,
And the one who reveals Nahemoth
Denying my cage of mortal flesh
Snatching me away from life
