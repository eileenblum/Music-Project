Why cherish this act of ignorance?
That brought lives to the slumbering dusts!!!
Molecules learnt to speak, to curse,
And to breed the ephemerals!!

Bearer of the skull now dances,
Snatching the 5th head of Brahma
Revealing Ugrakapalamurti
Craves to destroy the Brahmanda

Why cherish the act of ignorance
Utter cries in the anger of existenceâ¦

Here I am now tormented,
With the very sights of the Savitur
A blinding light now unleashed
And then the emptiness vanished
As he dives in the blood of rape
Seeking moksha shamelessly
In these hours I have danced
In an anti demiurgic trance

This is all but Brahmaâs fault
He is the one Creator God
He raped my daughter in ignorance
Breeding the cosmic creations

And, in silence I shall witness,
The absence of existence,
And, I will not die,
Nor shall I cease,
Till the world is gone,
To eternal sleep
