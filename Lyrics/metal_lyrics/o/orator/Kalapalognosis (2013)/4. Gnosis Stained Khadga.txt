I am dead, ordained by life itself
I am alive, ordained by the death

Witnessed the death of a million,
In this path of renunciation,
Amputated thoughts,
Smothered by those hands of wisdom

The Khadga is the Answer,
To the questions I have asked,
With that sword in your hand,
Transcend this life through death

Embraced the yajna of Chitagni!
Ash smeared and conjuring now,
I shall now set my mind aflame!
Penance with conduit of panchamakara

Gnosis stained Khadga
Kaliyei Namah

I shall embrace death by living on the dead flesh,
And I know my redemption; I am doped in that gnosis

Thieves of semen now feed the core,
Give it birth O Dakini, a cunning whore,

Mistress of Death, cease my breath
Redeem me, from this cosmic self
Death by the Khadga and the life is ceased,
Soulâs back to womb, thus the Black Ma is pleasedâ¦

Khadga became my Solace,
Its eye revealed the gnosis,
Redemption is in bleeding,
And my blood becomes Sindur dust
