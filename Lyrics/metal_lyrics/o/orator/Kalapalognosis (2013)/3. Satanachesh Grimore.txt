To behold the sights of the one I speak of
An ageless torture to the subtle eyes in sloth

Nachesh of self knowledge
Ye who spit fired the gift
Flaming sword put to the test
Upon the anvil with solid flesh
Structured by the bones
And, illumined not with ease

Uncoiled astral worm of death
And, death is what awaits us

Lactating and mongering
Bitter venom of sanctification
Thus it spreads the nectar
In two-one-eight forms

In isolation with the gift bestowed
Yet stranded neath the cosmic veil
Let this nausea set ye in trance
Mesmerized as Satanachesh dances

Are ye the cause of this sudden thirst?
I thrive to reach out to Chashak
The state of Azothan is a lifelong quest
This elixir commences the walk

Iâm mesmerized, Satanachesh, now dancing

Let blood of birth unite
With blood of death purified
As we banish the demiurgeâ¦
Enchanting from Satanachesh Grimore
