Primal legacy Rise!
To obliterate the universe
Immuring ordeal that championed
From the sin that formulated
Our enemy, the puny demiurge
In esoteric profanation

Echoes an erratic chant enshrined
Prayer from a concealed creed
Forbidden, nameless, formless
Acausal are the silent breeds

Liberation from chain of birth
Equality with the Infinite one
Behold the shadow crowned King
Coroneted by the akarmic anomaly

To yer kingdom of Sitra Ahra
We have offered our sacrifices
Beyond the mortal wilderness
Scourges of sacrilege take birth
Both gruesome and impious
We drink and dance in the madness
Redeemed by our antim nishkriti of weakness

Reducing logos to ashes
O Mighty Unmanifested one
Ye are the uncoiled Serpent
The mouth of the Eleven ones!

I see the Necrocosmic Apparitions
Causing decadence to the adversaries
Progeny of the demiurge and his mal-procreations

Hail Azerate...thy Kingdom Come at last!
