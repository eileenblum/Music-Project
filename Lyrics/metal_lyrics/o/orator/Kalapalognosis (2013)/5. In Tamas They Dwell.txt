Spawns of Her Black Yoni
In Tamas they dwell
Specters of the Susumna
In Tamas they dwell
Thieves of yer lost semen
In Tamas they dwell
Agents of Trans-mutation
In Tamas they dwell

Apparent shadows of disdains
Revealed by an intriguing fatality
If ye have not the active shield
Away they go and return not

Winged, they try reaching out
Have they failed to fathom?
The Tamas ye have concealed
In the cloak of doubt and dispute

Avritishakti of the great Tamas
Gaze deep within but ye see nothing
Shape shifting existence of mal-thoughts
Battling with their mutual immunity

Only misery weakens this barrier
Turns it into an abolishment zone
In the depth of Tamas Cavern
Causal affinity burns with its MAKER!
Should ye authorize them hordes?
To enter and deviate the epitome
By destroying the lairs of clays
For thatâs what ye are by birth

And when this catastrophe unleashed
Resistance would only cause duality
As the lava of ego bursts out in Tamas
The ground that ye have raped unknowingly

By this time ye have known
We are bound by the karma
Now gather the secretion
Unspoiled menstrual blood
