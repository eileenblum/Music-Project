Dust in the sky - Another bullet for the head of a lie

Where is the sun? - It is so far away
The sun is gone - Only you gotta stay
Don't mind if their words are true
Just do what they tell you to
Your will is gone - It is so far away
Their will be done - You've got nothing to say
You would believe if you only could see
But there's too much fucking dust on your [Image] t

War - You're just a victim of war

Dust in your eye - And now the bullet's in the head of the lie
Dust in your eye - And now the bullet's in the head of the lie

Where is your pride? - It is so far away
There's only night and you still have to stay
Don't mind if their story's true
Just do what they want you to
Where is your god? - It is so far away
There was a lot - Now there's nothing to pray
You would resist if you only could see
But there's too much fucking dust on your [Image] t

War - You're just a victim of war

Don't open your eyes - Don't care about lies
Just shut your mouth - You're just a victim of war
Keep holding your gun - Keep holding your toungue
Just shut you brain - You're just a victim of war
Don't care about pain - Don't care about shame
Just shut your mind - You're just a victim of war
Keep - Trying to sleep - Keep counting the sheep
Just shoot 'em down - You're just a victim of war - Go! - Fight! - War
