U said 'We could be a nation'
It's time - Time to make amends
Wake up! - Feel the fascination
Join us! - Fate is in our hands'

Raise your body!

U said 'Meet me at the station
It's time - Time to be a man
Awake! - Feel your domination
Restrain! - Every now and then'

Raise your body!

Don't think too much! - Listen!:
I am the mood that sticks in your mind
I am the boot that kicks your behind
I am the thorn that burns in your side
I am the dawn - The turn of the tide
I am the heat that's making you sweat
I am the beat that's breaking your head
I am the sound that's giving you pain
I am the hound that's living again...

U said 'Stop your lamentation
It's time - Time to understand
Live fast! - Drop reincarnation
Die young! - Only for your land'

Hold your head up high
I kick it away - You bother!
