Bad milk comes in your mouth
Bad milk burns on your tounge
Makes you afraid
Bad milk runs in your gorge
Bad milk - Now you are here
Now it's too late

Suck - Taste - Spit
Welcome to life

Bad words crash in your ears
Bad words - Down in the womb
You couldn't hide
Bad words smashing your soul
Bad words - Could you get back
Back to the night?

Suck - Taste - Spit
Welcome to life

Bad flood flushing your veins
Bad blood - Up to your head
Down to your heart
Bad blood crushing your dreams
Bad blood eats you all up
Tears you apart

You should be thankful
Suck - Taste - Spit
Fuck it!
