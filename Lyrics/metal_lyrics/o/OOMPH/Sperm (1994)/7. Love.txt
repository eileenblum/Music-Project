You make me shiver
You make me quiver
You make me feel
Like I'm losing my breath

Don't take me higher
Don't light my fire
'Cause I'm afraid
It could burn me to death

Don't think about
Don't talk about
Forget about
Don't think about
Don't talk about
Don't speak it out

Love - Don't give me love

And as I'm yearning
My bed is burning
And then again
I am starting to freeze
And as I'm shaking
My heart is aching
And in your eyes
I can see the disease

Don't think about...
Don't do it

Love - Don't give me love
Stop this!
