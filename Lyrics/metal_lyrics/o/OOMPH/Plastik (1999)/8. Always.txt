The morning after
Still hear your laughter
Why can't we sleep always?

The party's over
I'm gettin sober
Why can't we sleep always?

You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!

Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly lose my brain
Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly go insane

And while I'm dreaming
Still hear you screaming
Why can't we sleep always?

I'm so relendless
But nothing's endless
Why can't we sleep always?

You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!

Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly lose my brain
Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly go insane
