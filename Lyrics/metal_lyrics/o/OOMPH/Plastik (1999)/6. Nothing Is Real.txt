Make me weep until I'm blind
Let me sleep - My teeth wonÂ´t grind
Take my breath until I feel
Beat my chest - I'm broken

Burn my world - You turn the wheel
My world - Until I feel
My world - DonÂ´t try to heal
My world - Nothing is real

Nothing is real - Nothing is real
Nothing is real - Nothing is real

Let me drink until I find
YouÂ´ve always been on my mind
Cut my skin until I feel
Everything is broken

Burn my world - You turn the wheel
My world - Until I feel
My world - Don't try to heal
My world - Nothing is real

Burn my world - You turn the wheel
My world - Until I feel
Don't try to heal my world
