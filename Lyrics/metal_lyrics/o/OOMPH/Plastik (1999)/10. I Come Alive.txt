You are the thorn in my side, you are the turn of the tide
I never thought you can make me feel so new
Now that you sharpened the knife, I think I'm coming alive
I can't believe that this hurting feels so true
You know I need to be cleansed, you hold my life in your
hands
And now I'm willing to bear the cross for you
Now that you've put me in chains, now that youÂ´ve opened
my veins
I can't believe that my world turned black and blue

Do I really feel the way you do?
Do I really feel the way you do?
You never told me that I can breathe, like you
You never told me that I can freeze, like you

I never wanted a cure, I never tried to be pure
But now I know that you're able to renew
And now I'm begging for more, although it hurts to the core
'Cause now I know you're as healing as a flu

Do I really feel the way you do?
Do I really feel the way you do?
You never told me that I can breathe, like you
(Oh I come alive - oh I come alive)
You never told me that I can freeze, like you
(Oh I come alive - oh I come alive)

I come alive - I come alive
I come alive - I come alive
I come alive - I come alive
I come alive - I come alive
