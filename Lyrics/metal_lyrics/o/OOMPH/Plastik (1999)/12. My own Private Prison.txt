I'll fill you up with a new kind of glamour
I'll make you frown with a true kind of tremor
I'll lift you up 'cause my God's just arisen
I'll take you down to my own private prison

I'll fill you up with the breath of the rotten
I'll bring you down to the lost and forgotten
I'll wrap you up in the sweetest apparel
I'll make you frown with a view down the barrel

I'll take you up to my own cemetery
I'll drag you down girl - I'm too solitary
I'll lift you up 'cause you're my only treasure
I'll make you frown for my own private pleasure

Nothing can tear us apart
Nothing can tear us apart

You won't save me from love that hurts me
You won't spare me from life that kills me

I'll fill you up with a new kind of glamour
I'll make you frown with a true kind of tremor
I'll lift you up 'cause my God's just arisen
I'll take you down to my own private prison

Nothing can tear us apart
Nothing can tear us apart

You won't save me from love that hurts me
You won't spare me from life that kills me
