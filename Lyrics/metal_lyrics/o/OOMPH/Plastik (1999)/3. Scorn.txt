Will you scorn me, will you break me?

Will you scorn me, will you hate me?
WonÂ´t you finally consecrate me?

Are you able to forsake me?
Won't you finally consecrate my hate?

Bite - nothing can save me from my scorn
Fight - nothing can spare me from my hate
Bite - nothing can save me from my scorn
Fight - nothing can spare me from my ...
