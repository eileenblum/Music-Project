You make it worth it
You make it all worthwhile
Your love is workin'
Your love is versatile

I let it happen
I let you fill my soul
I let it happen
I'm bound to lose control
Now you can save me
You can save me

Isolation - concentration
Isolation - transformation
I'm fuckin' anxious
I'm fuckin' anxious now

You make it worth it
'Cause now I'm afebrile
Your love is workin'
I'm sober for a while

I let it happen
I let you kill my pain
I let it happen
I let you stop the rain
Now you can save me
You can save me

Isolation - concentration
Isolation - transformation
I'm fuckin' anxious
I'm fuckin' anxious now

Isolation - concentration
Isolation - transformation
Isolation
