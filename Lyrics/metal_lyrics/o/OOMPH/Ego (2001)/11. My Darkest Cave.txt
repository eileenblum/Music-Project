When will I lose my mask of dirt
When will I only stop to hurt
Sittin' on my electric chair
Thinkin' that god would meet me there

When will I stop diggin' my grave
When will I leave my darkest cave
Down in this sweet old fuckin' hole
I am about to lose control

Give in my love - put on your glove
Give in my love - there is a real thing
There is a friend - a helping hand
There is a friend - there is a real thing
I've got a reason to live
I've got a (w)hole lot to give

When will I lose my crown of shit
When will I have the guts to quit
Lying on my own guilloutine
Sweating out zero endorphine

Give in my love - put on your glove
Give in my love - there is a real thing
There is a friend - a helping hand
There is a friend - there is a real thing
I've got a reason to live
I've got a (w)hole lot to give
