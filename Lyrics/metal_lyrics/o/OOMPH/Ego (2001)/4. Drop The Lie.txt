I will try - you will see
Don't deny - you and me

All - all of my lies
All - all of my tries
All - all of my lies
All - all of my cries

Let me try to sacrify
Let me try to drop the lie
Let me fuckin'

You have my empathy
Don't you cry - let me be
All - all of my lies
All - all of my tries
All - all of my lies
All - all of my cries

Let me try to sacrify
Let me try to drop the lie
Let me fuckin'
Let me drop the lie
