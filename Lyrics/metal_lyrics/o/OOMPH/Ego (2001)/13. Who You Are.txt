I'm still in the vacuum of your heart
I still can remember who you are
One breath of your lungs has torn me apart
("Just help me")
I'm still in the vacuum of your heart

Do you remember just who you are
The cold december has burnt out your star
Deny me - untie me - derange me - paralyze me
Annoy me - destroy me - erase me - mesmerize me

I'm still in the vacuum of your heart
I still keep on opening your scar
I'm tryin' to reach your soul but it's hard
("Just let me")
I'm still in the vacuum of your heart

Do you remember just who you are
The cold december has taken you far
Deny me - untie me - derange me - paralyze me
Annoy me - destroy me - erase me - mesmerize me

Do you remember just who you are
The cold december has burnt out your star
Can imagine who you could've been
No fuckin' medicine can fondle your skin
