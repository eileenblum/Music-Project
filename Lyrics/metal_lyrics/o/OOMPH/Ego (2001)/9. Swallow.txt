So don't you rescue me
I'm blocked in the black of my mind
("Help me please")
So don't get stuck on me
My fuckup is keepin' me blind
("Save me please")

Tossin' and turnin'
You know 'bout this yearnin'
This feeling you've locked deep inside
So swallow your frown - my love
And follow me down - my love

So don't you rescue me
I still feel the thorn in my side
("Help me please")
So don't you set me free
No chance for a turn of the tide
("Save me please")

Tossin' and turnin'
You know 'bout this burnin'
This fever you cannot deny
So swallow your frown - my love
And follow me down - my love
Follow me down
Down
