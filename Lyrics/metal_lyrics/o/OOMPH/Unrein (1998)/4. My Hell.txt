you'll never know how my hell burns
you'll never know how my hell turns
you'll never know how my heart kills
you'll never know what my heart needs
nothing can surpass the murderous...
nothing can surpass the murderous...
nothing can surpass the murderous...
nothing can surpass the murderous...
you'll never know how my hell feels
you'll never know just how it feels
you'll never know how my heart beats
you'll never know what my heart leads
nothing can surpass the murderous...
screaming
nothing can surpass the murderous...
screaming
nothing can surpass the murderous...
screaming
nothing can surpass the murderous...
screaming
come and surpass the murderous...
try and surpass the murderous...
you'll never know what my hell means
it's never just like how it seems
you'll never know what makes me freeze
what fucking forces me to breathe
(help! help! help! help me!)
nothing can surpass the murderous...
screaming
fear is my strength
here in my hell
(to) love means to hurt
tears in my eyes
here I will die
(to) love means to hurt
kiss me goodbye
I'll stay disguised
(to) love means to hurt
