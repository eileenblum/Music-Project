peel me
stab like a fencer
until I can feel you again
heal me
spread like a cancer
until I can feel all this pain
burn like a fire
release me
and then let me drown again
burn like a fire
to freeze me
and then let me drown again
tease me
crush down my beaver
until I can see you again
ease me
hush me with fever
until I can see all this rain
burn like a fire
release me
and then let me drown again
feed my desire
relieve me
and then let me down again
feed my desire
deceive me
and then let me down again
