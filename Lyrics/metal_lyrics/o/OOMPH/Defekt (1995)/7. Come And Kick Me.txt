You beat me down and I crawl on the floor
you lift me up and i'm begging for more
you know by now what I fucking abhor
don't ever stop it's never enough
you fill my heart with your terrible lies
and then again I see truth in your eyes
you always know what I fucking despise
don't ever think it's too much too much

come on come on come on come on
rule me, you hold my life in one hand
come on come on come on come on
fool me, so many things to pretend

kiss me
rape me
deflorate me
love me
trick me
come and kick me

you scrape my scar and you scratch on the nerve
you make it heal and i'm begging to serve
you  know the best what I fucking deserve
don't ever stop it's never enough
you've got the cure and i'm begging
you please come fill me up with another disease
you'll always be such a fucking release
don't ever think it's too much

kiss me
rape me
deflorate me
love me
trick me
come and kick me
(you give me reason to live you give me anything)
go!
