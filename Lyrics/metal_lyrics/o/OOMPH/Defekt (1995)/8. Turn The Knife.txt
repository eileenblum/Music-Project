I'm sinking deeper in the black of this hole
I can't remember if there once was my soul
I wanna know if i'm still able to feel
and this why you got to give me the steel

you turn the knife I come alive
come on now gimme the knife
come on now get me alive

so whet the blade and get it under my skin
I hope you cut away the sore of my sin
I can't believe I want you holding me tight
now that the steel is coming one with my side

always wanted to believe in your love
sometimes I thought that you were sent from above
and now I know you've got the power to heal
and this is why you got to give me the steel
