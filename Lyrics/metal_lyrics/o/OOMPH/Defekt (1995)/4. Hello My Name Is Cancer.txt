This is the right time to say hello
my name is cancer
i'll never go i'm gonna hurt you
I am the thorn that makes you
wish you were never born

don't try so hard denying me
you better start accepting me
don't fall apart  believe in me
open your heart  give in to me
baby say can you feel me?

i'll turn your head in a fucking hole
i'll rip your mind out  i'll burn your soul
I am the anguish inside your brain
i'll fill you up with eternal pain
