I'm losing ground
I bear no sound

The only thing I wanna let you know
I never meant to hurt you
The only thing I really know for sure
I never meant to kill you

I'm going down
As you see
I can feel your hand
Reaching out for me

I lose my mind
I hate my kind

The only thing I wanna let you know
I never meant to hurt you
The only thing I really know for sure
I never meant to kill you

I'm going down...

I'm not going down

I'm going down...
