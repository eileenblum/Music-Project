Oh my God all the people in the street
They look like fucking machines
Oh my God all the zombies seem to meet
they all have put on their screens

All my friends are broken toys
All my friends have lost their voice

I've got to burn your eyes
Until you feel your lies
Until you realize you were so blind

Oh my God all the noise inside my head
It's like a million sirenes
Oh my God all the zombies start to spread
I'll save them - by any means

All my friends...

I've got to...

Let me burn your eyes

I've got to...
