When will I start to break my chains
When will I start to take the pleading

Your nothing could change me
Your nothing could save me

When will I stop to cut my veins
When will I start to stop the bleeding

Your nothing could change me
Your nothing could save me

I come undone
Nothing can change my life
But you my sweetest friend
I come undone
Nothing can save my life
Until the very end
DonÂ´t you feel that I'm nothing without you

When will I start to fight the reign
When will I start to bite the greedy

Your nothing could change me
Your nothing could save me

When will I start to kill the pain
When will I start to still the needy

Your nothing could change me
Your nothing could save me

I come undone...

Can you stop me going nowhere
Though nothing's as hard as this

I come undone...
