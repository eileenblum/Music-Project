I try to relieve myself
I try to deceive myself

What you see is what you get tonight
What you see is what you get tonight

Answer me - answer me
Should I stay - should I pray for you
Should I stay - should I pray for you

Answer me - answer me...

I try to extend the line
I try to pretend I'm fine

What you see is what you get tonight
What you see is what you get tonight

Answer me - answer me
Should I stay - should I pray for you
Should I stay - should I pray for you

Answer me - answer me...

Tell me why - tell me why
Give me a reason to purify my mind
Tell me why - tell me why
Give me a reason to modify my kind

Answer me - answer me...
