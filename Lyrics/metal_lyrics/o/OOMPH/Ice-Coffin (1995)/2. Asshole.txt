I am an asshole
Yes I am
And I'm gonna hurt you
I am a wanker
Yes I know
And I'll never change
I am a sick man
Yes I am
And I will desert you
I am a buster
And I know that I won't be sad

You don't have to run
I have just begun

I am an asshole
Yes I am
And you will be sorry
I am a wanker
Yes I know
And I want you dead
I am a sick man
Yes I am
And I won't be sorry
I am a buster
And I know that I won't be sad

You don't have to cry
??? just a lie

And when I look at you
It's like ???
And when I'm touching you
It's like a devil touching ???
And when I'm kissing you
It's like the summer kissing ???
And when I'm loving you
It's like the winter loving the sun

I am an asshole
Yes I am
So why don't you kill me?
