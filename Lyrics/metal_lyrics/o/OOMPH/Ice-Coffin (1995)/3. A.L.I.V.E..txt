You keep me fucking alive my dear
And I can ??? you wherever you are
I'm gonna keep on searching you
???
You keep me fucking alive my dear
And I can tell you that I'm pretty upset
And even if there's ???
???
No

You keep me fucking alive
You keep me fucking A.L.I.V.E.

You keep me fucking alive my dear
And yes I know I got a little bit bad
I may be full of sick desire
But ???
You keep me fucking alive my dear
And I know someday I'll know where you live
And the more I think of you
I can't imagine that I'll never forgive

You keep me hiding
You keep me hating
You keep me breathing
You keep me waiting
You keep me breathing
You keep me biting
You keep me kicking
You keep me hiding
