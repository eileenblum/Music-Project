I try to slip away, you wanna make me stay
Don't try to hold me back 'cause I will break your neck
Don't try to make a light, don't even come inside
You won't like what you'll see, untangle you from me

You wish I had my wings like puppets have their strings
I like the dirt I'm in, hide in my filthy skin
Don't try to follow me, don't even lean on me
'Cause after losing ground you would not hear the sound

If there's a chance to heal these wounds in my hands
To fill this hole in my heart
To kill this hate in my soul
If there's a way you know I'd beg you to stay
You know I'm trying so hard
But now I'm down in this hole

Don't try to set me free, don't even rescue me
It fucking eats me up, and it will never stop
I know it's much too late, I feel so unafraid
And now it's time I guess to concentrate on death

If there's a chance to heal these wounds in my hands
To fill this hole in my heart
To kill this hate in my soul
If there's a way you know I'd beg you to stay
You know I'm dying so hard
'Cause now I'm down in this hole
(Kill me)

If you believe it would be better to leave
Because it tears you apart
Because it's out of control
If you'd decide because you're sick of this fight
Because itÂ´s fucking too hard
Then leave me down in this hole
