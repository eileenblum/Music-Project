I was born in the cold December
I was born and I still remember
I was born and my eyes were swollen
I was born and my futureÂ´s stolen

Pinned alive
Whipped alive
Slashed alive
And the wheels were turning
Skinned alive
Ripped alive
Smashed alive
And the sheets were burning

Born - praised - kissed
Torn - raped - pissed
Scorn - hate - fist
Lorn - blade - wrist
Suck my dick - I like it!

I was born in a fucking chamber
I was born - yes I do remember
I was born and my heart was broken
I was born and my life was token

Pinned alive
Whipped alive
Slashed alive
And the wheels were turning
Skinned alive
Ripped alive
Smashed alive
And the sheets were burning

Born - praised - kissed
Torn - raped - pissed
Scorn - hate - fist
Lorn - blade - wrist

Put down your head for me
Suck my dick - I like it!
