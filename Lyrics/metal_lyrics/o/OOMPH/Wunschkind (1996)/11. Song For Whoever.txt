Hey man! What's Up?
What the fuck is wrong with your mind?
My God! You suck!
You're so fucking stupid and blind
You Smile - you lie
You're so motherfucking sublime
Fuck you! Goodbye!
'Cause you're fucking stealing my time

First you explore and you wanna taste
Then you exploit and you're laying waste
While you destroy and you don't repair
You cannot open your mind
You always judge while you can't forgive
You only take but you never give
You sit and wait on your liars' chair
You cannot open your mind

Pain in your head now - you toss and turn in your bed now
Pain in your head now - if only you could forget now
Pain in your head now - and you deserve what you get now
Pain in your head now - you only wish you were dead now

Hey man! Shut up!
'Cause I've had enough of your lies
What should that fuck?
You're a fucking creep in my eyes
You still deny - I'm so fucking sick of your kind
Fuck off and die!
You can fucking kiss my behind

First you explore and you wanna taste
Then you exploit and you're laying waste
While you destroy and you don't repair
You cannot open your mind
You always judge while you can't forgive
You only take but you never give
You sit and wait on your liars chair
You cannot open your mind

Pain in your head now - you toss and turn in your bed now
Pain in your head now - if only you could forget now
Pain in your head now - and you deserve what you get now
Pain in your head now - you only wish you were dead now
