You gimmie the sun, you gimmie the moon
You gimmie the stars - you've got it
You gimmie your heart - you gimmie your mind
You gimmie your scars - you've got it
You gimmie the storm, you gimmie the fire
You gimmie the rain - you've got it
You gimmie your love, you gimmie the hate
You gimmie your pain - you've got it

You gimmie your grief, you gimmie rage
You gimmie your fears - you've got it
You gimmie your lies, you gimmie your shame
You gimmie your tears - you've got it
You gimmie your war, you gimmie your fight
You gimmie your peace - you've got it
You gimmie the rise, you gimmie the fall
You gimmie release - you've got it

Love me! - Save me! - Thrill me! - Deprave me!
Scorn me! - Use me! - Kill me! - Reduce me!
Burn my heart now!!!

Love me! - Chain me! - Thrill me! - Restrain me!
Scorn me! - Face me! - Kill me! - Erase me!
Blind my eyes now!!!

Love me! - Change me! - Thrill me! - Derange me!
Scorn me! - Hate me! - Kill me! - Cremate me!
(Love me to death!)

I've been so old from the day I was born you said
Been getting sold from the day I was born you said
Been losing hold from the day I was born you said
It's been so cold from the day I was born you said

I've been afraid from the day I was born you said
Been getting paid from the day I was born you said
It's been my fate from the day I was born you said
It's been too late since the day I was born you said

Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!!!
