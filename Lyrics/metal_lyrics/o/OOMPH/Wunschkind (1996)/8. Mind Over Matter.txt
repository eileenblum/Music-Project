Now you're gone I fear
But somehow you're still here
You did not want to hear
But now I do not want to remember
Did not know my name
But liked to play this game
And then you fan the flame
'Cause then I saw your eyes made of amber
Stop that noise!

You were so afraid
You looked like Sharon Tate
I think it was your fate
But no! I do not want to remember
Then you broke the spell
Cried: "Help me - I'm in hell!"
It was your final yell
'Cause then I shut the door of your chamber
Stop that noise!

Do you feel the knife when I thrill you?
Do you feel alive when I kill you?

Fuck me - mind over matter

I knew from the start
That you would break my heart
And then I fell apart
But now I do not want to remember
Now you hold my hand
Say now I understand
Why death is not the end
And now we feel the cold of December
Stop that noise!

Do you feel the knife when I thrill you?
Dou you feel alive when I kill you?

Fuck me - mind over matter
