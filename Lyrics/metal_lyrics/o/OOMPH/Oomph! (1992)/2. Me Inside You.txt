Let me inside you
Let me inside you
In your veins
In your brain
Let me inside you
Let me inside you
Through your pore
Show me more

Push me through the hardness of your ??? tissue
Shove me through the thickness of your blood
Lead me through the darkness of your entrails
I'm coming
I'm coming
Push me
Shove me
Lead me
Baby

How many tears in your face?
How many wasted tears?
With me
Inside of many
How many beads of sweat on your skin?
How many wasted beads
With me with me
Inside of many
