Cry don't cry
Don't be afraid
Try just try
Let it in you
Try
Cry don't cry
It's getting late
Try just try
Follow me
Down

Breathe in
though it hurts
I know you can
Breathe in
though it burns
I know you can
I know you want
Follow me
Follow me

Breathe in
Cold dead water
???
Breathe in
Cold dead water
Please walk with me
Follow me

Cry cry
Don't cry

Breathe out
Breathe in
Stay alive
Breathe in
Stay alive
Breathe in
Don't cry
Breathe in
I'll try
Now breathe in

Still alive
Under water
Breathe
Still alive
Breathe with me
