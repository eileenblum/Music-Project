You are trembling all over
You canât control yourself
Your eye is twitching in time with your fear
The fear that fills you
The fear you canât conceal
You turned pale like a corpse
Youâve nowhere to run
Iâm reading your mind
You should better forget it
Inside your head anticipation of death
Inside my head laughter
Inside your head supplication for mercy
Inside my head mercilessness
Are you satisfied with yourself?
Are you satisfied?! I guess no!
You are a miserable coward, a downtrodden animal
Nowhere to hide from your fate
You are alive so far
Forget a right for the last wish
Youâre not worth it
I know that people should learn
By swallowing their own pain
I know they should be stronger
With every fucking wound
