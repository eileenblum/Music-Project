Our best time is passed
Exasperation, betrayal, disastrous disorders will follow us till the grave
Itâs hard to stay on the goodside
When looking at the mirror you realized
That youâre as crap as they are
Defending jerks â weâre butchering anothers
Weâre butchering another fucking jerks
There are no murderers and victims in this war
Each of us is here. Each of us has built up this nigtmare
Weâre all will be sorry, for not listening to the words of those
Who knows ever god damn thing
Those, who is everything
Everyone knows what will be the fuckin finish like
If not, they must have guess
