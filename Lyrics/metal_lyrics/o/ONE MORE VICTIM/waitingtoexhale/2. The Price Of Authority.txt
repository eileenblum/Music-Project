In a secluded society where is guilty every single one
The only crime is to be taken in the act of a crime
In to the thievish world stupidity is the gravest sin
That wretched and inhuman world they live in
Is not in what way we see it
Coming out from there theyâre bringing putrefaction
Which made them rot there with the same bastards
Extirpating the malice with the help of other brutality
We give rise to the more monumental malice, than we got accustomed to see
Malice is easily to notice in everything
Kindness one must discern
In our shitty world not so much kindness and sympathy then in their... Even not less
Extirpating the malice with the help of other brutality
We give rise to the more monumental malice, than we got accustomed to see
They must find it difficult...
Those who have taken authority as the truth, rather than truth as the authority
