We are destined to be born in sacred blood
And saturate the soil with decay
It's our destiny
Our eternal curse
We can't resist its will
It's fated to come true
To put anyone who was free on his knees
Who has never given up
Was never afraid to look ahead
But we should give credence to our roots
They will show us the way to the light
Which is so far away
And will save from the dark, always near
Help to leave it behind
But it will keep chasing us with its despicable gaze
Will wait for the moment to thrust its knife into our back
Life is so short when you don't value it
The lost opportunity will never repeat itself
A dead body will never rise again
A disease won't cure itself
Try and remember this
Before your last hour will strike
It's hard to find your way in the labyrinth of life
It's even harder to do it alone
Without looking at the mistakes of the past
You'll never reach the final chapter
Try and remember this
Before your last hour will strike.
