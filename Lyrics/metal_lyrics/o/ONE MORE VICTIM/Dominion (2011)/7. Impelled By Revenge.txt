Too kind for some
Too weak for others
You are a pariah in the world where the winner
Is he who doesn't give a damn about anybody
Who's ready to make his way over corpses
To get to the top
It's impossible to adjust
But you can't bow and scrape
Those who oppressed you should see
You are not the one you seemed to be
Not the one whose will could be broken
Animal essence
Is running through your veins
Primeval fury
Ancestor's practice is not forgotten
Unleash your demons
Release them and set against those
Who oppressed you
Drive out fire with fire
Multiplying your anger
Only then they will know
The real price of what they have done
And they will pay with their life
Filled with fear, saturated with thousands of grudges.
