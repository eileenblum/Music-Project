Once having crossed the line
You won't leave the road
Only spitting upon all reproaches
You can choose your way of life
To stay composed
Looking your fate in the face
Not to resign oneself
To all the hardships surrounding us
Only then
You will raise above others
Only the
You will change the world
You shouldn't put up with
Rotten human race
Where everyone
Is stronger and better than you
You should stay true to yourself
Otherwise you'll become
As petty and mean as others
They will find a reproach
In each of your deeds
And one day you will see
That you were right
You will see
That you were afraid to disregard them
And hadn't made a choice
While you could
Once having crossed the line
You won't leave the road
Only spitting upon all reproaches
You can choose your way of life.
