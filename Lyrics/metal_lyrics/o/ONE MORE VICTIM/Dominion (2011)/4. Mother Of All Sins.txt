You'd like to help everybody
To save them from themselves
Shining proudly like a star in the sky
Not only you
But what for?
Messiah or miserable hypocrite?
You are not the man you wanna seem to be
What is more important -- general approval or human life?
If you understand it once
You'll learn the main lesson of life
Giving power to the weak
Protecting them from the strong
Being a symbol of good
Is what you should have become
You can't save people with arrogance
And can't save yourself
The time may come
When everyone will find inside
The savior
The power of good
That's so little in the world of today
And everyone will accomplish a deed
The world will get better
The hope lives on
In the hearts of those who can't submit.
