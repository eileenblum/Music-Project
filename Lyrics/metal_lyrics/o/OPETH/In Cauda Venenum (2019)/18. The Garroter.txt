Lone hunter in the fray
Of a lonely fading light
A manifest for the garroter
Stuck to his plight

Young and elder, nevermind
Programmed mortal set lifeline

A mother says no
And father cracks a simple plan
A knife is sharpened
His children run but he'll advance

Alas, how fragile life can be
Love is strong when death foresees
Yet the story won't end here
No, oh no, oh no

Ulterior motive
The grinning face of leadership
A selfish wish to control
A nation in his grip

Strong against weak and immobilized
Secular for fascist lies

The beautiful people
Look down from ruby vantage points
While in the gutter
Starvation invites us to join

Barricades of wealthy youth
Protesting their inborn truth
