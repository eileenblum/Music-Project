[Spoken word, ramblings:]
"Who is God? What is God?"
"That's a tricky question!" "I don't believe in God!"
"Do you believe in God?" "No" "Why would I?"

Three thousand dreams in pale moonlight
Counting...
Three thousand years of Winter's blight
Ticking off against my heart

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Three hundred days in an endless night
The frost smiles
Three hundred weapons on manhunt
Craving more blood to its name

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Cities, violated graves
Yonder distance, perfect slave
You!

[Spoken word:]
"God, God, Godâ¦is God his name?"
"No, Jesus!" "Is there only one God?" "No"
"How many are there?" "30 million and hundreds of thousands!"
"Wow!" "There's one in each country" "OK!"
"Can they speak to each other?"
"â¦No!"

[Ramblings:]
"He can fly and only has one head"
"People say that he's watching over us from up thereâ¦"
"On a moon image" "One dies"
"There is no right or wrong" [Repeat]
"What do you think happens when one dies?"
"â¦I guess I think that one will remain in one's grave, kind ofâ¦"
