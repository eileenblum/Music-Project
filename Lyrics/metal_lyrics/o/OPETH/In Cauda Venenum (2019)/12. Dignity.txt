"At a year's end many will experience a feeling of melancholy, considering that which will never return. To others it is a moment of anticipation for the possibilities of conquering the new. Others yet will experience a concern facing a change that provides uncertainty and possible deterioration. All of these emotions are each in their own understandable. Someone said the other day that we reside in the great time of rupture."
[Quote by Olof Palme, Swedish prime-minister (S) 1969-1976, 1982-1986, assassinated 1986, murder still unsolved. Words culled from his New Year's speech to the nation 1969]

Prince of lies is on his knees
Holy rites, spreading the disease
By his side a youthful girl
Wedlocked force unfurls
She's young
Far too young

Far too young

Can we dictate a life with dignity?
Foul agenda corrupt in secrecy
Oh no no no no no

One false prayer wielding blasphemy
Price the spirit as a wanted property
Oh no no no no no

Congratulations to the five men of affairs
There was a purpose with this life
Insinuations (that) if she holds anything dear
Then it motivates submission in his lair

He is waiting for darkness
He opens the door
He's slithering
