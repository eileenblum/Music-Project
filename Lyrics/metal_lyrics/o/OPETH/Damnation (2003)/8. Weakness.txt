Found you there in the blink of an eye
(I) miss you
Turned away into a thousand dreams
Found out what they mean

Lost you there in a moment of truth
(I) trust you
Gave away the one and only heart
(A) gift to tear apart

Stain me, save me
Take me to my home
Hold me, show me
Take me to my home

Weaker now, drawing fluid from me
(You) kill me
I'm not afraid of what you have just done
(But of) what you've just become
