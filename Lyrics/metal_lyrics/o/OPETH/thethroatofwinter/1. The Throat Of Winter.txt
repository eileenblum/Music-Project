The throat of Winter is upon us
And the cold will linger in me

Sheild of the eternal river again

Our fevered bodies will return
to the bowels of the vast decrepit earth

The devil spoke and called us to his side

Never will return again
Never will I feel the rain
Never will return again
Never will I feel the rain

Throat of Winter

A demigod is observing us through child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now
A demigod is observing us with child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now
