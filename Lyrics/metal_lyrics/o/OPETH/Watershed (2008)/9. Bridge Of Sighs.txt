[Special edition bonus track]
[Robin Trower cover]

[x2]
Sun don't shine
The moon don't move
The tides to wash me clean

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Spent a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

[x2]
Cold wind blows
And the gods look down
In anger of this poor child

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs
