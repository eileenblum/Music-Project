Will the children cry
When their mother dies
And in the autumn of their lives
Will they feel the same?

[reversed lyrics 2:03-2:22:]
"I see you
My sweet Satan
Come back tonight
Out of the courtyard"

Her longing for me
Comin' down like hail
Why did you leave me?

Come here inside
Come tell me how
How in my final days
I found the rout

The light comes on
The signal for us to end our lives
You wait beneath the white sheets and you wait forever

The night comes on
Your weakness starting to erase all your lies
So I left you alone
We all left you alone

[reversed lyrics 7:21-7:24:]
"They'll lock all your reasons why"

Lock the children away from harm
They'll lock all your reason why
Seeking tenderness with a dagger
Skin is blocked by the years of trial

You felt abandoned in the fog of flesh
Sitting in place from the dead
Awaiting the face of the moon to ascend
You follow the siren in your head

In your head
