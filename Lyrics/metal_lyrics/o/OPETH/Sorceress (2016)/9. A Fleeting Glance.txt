Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life, but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me,
"How long? How long?"

Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Biding my time until courage had built up inside me
Then came clean
"Or am I wrong"

[Solo: Ãkerfeldt]

I spend all my days contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth
When it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine
"I walk the line"

A fleeting glance again
Tells me everything
Took a chance in vain
Drawn to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness
As the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness
Paved the way and then gave in

I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years or more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we're all born to die
Gave me purpose
Freed me
"How simple it can be"

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind

[Solo: Ãkerfeldt]

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind
