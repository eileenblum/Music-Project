I am going away
I am going down

Sifting through a memory
Before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy
A million words astray

I cannot remember happiness
I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness
Is a veil that keeps my calm

By the way, I am doing fine
I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, I do not need sympathy
I have a place to lay
I have more than you can see

I walk the streets alone at night
It helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light
And leave all woes behind
