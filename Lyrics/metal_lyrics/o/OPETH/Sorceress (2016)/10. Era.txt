There is a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It's a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode
In the hour of death
There is a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the signs once again

If even for a second

I hear a voice on the air
It has a warning to share
"Do not believe what you see.
You cannot perceive what you feel."
But if I do what I am told
And shun the spirit I hold
I am no longer a human
And I will not shift with the sands

[2x]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you

There are moments of doubt
When I do not know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there is too much shouting
About how I should choose
Incapacitated, I am left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
A storm is coming, I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray

[Solo: Ãkesson]

[2x]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
