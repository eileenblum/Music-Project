[Bonus Track]No more wishes for the past
No lingering of sages and seers
And desperations and fevers last,
The undertows are stronger here.

And here I lie, another morning arrives
Too far away from coming home

I see a face in the snow, inside my head a voice calls for me
I see your face in the snow and outside the sun's too far away to feel

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home.

And here I lie, another morning arrives,
Too far away from coming home

And could we live within the wake of aging lies
When we re too far away?
