I sold my freedom eternal
Wondering if we must
Lament the dead forever
Tell me how to really feel inside
When I'm starting to get sick of you
In silence and pain

You are in my dreams
I'll stay with you my star tonight...
Something from my paradise
Belongs to you, I need you.

I want to get close to you
To warm your body like snake

Fly together with my soul
Keep me inside you
I'll stay...
