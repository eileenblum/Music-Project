And you hurt me inside
Knowing and killing my pride
Trying to take control
Changing my path
I fear the passion

I'm falling supporting in a dream
The automatic future
Seems like monster destiny
Chaos, illusion of my mind

Echoes from nowhere
Memories from emotions
Broken desires
Living thoughts

I fear you psychotic serenity
Nervous disturbance of mind
And waves of negatic energy
Dying slow and tired
