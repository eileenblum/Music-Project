Take me to the skies like god
Like the pretty thought of youth
Follow your way and fight
For your tomorrow

I don't if I can
I can wait to believe
Open your eyes and live
Live to the moon

Confessing eveytging I feel
And everything I need from you
Corrupting my reality
And like a bird I fly to you

Walking to horizons of space
I reflect if love is colder than death
Dying across the land of ice
Pictures come like waves

Shedding tears, enrace the past
Don't look back and keep your faith
Straight up in sunshine
No need to cry
