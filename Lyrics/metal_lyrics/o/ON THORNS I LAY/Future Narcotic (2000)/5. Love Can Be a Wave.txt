The secret of flame silent I describe
From limitless domension
And endless horizons, I fly...

Travelers all of us to the coast of hope
The lighthouse of life think that rule
The world, but they don't

I cry to the emptiness turning back and fighting
Like animal the pain bloody Sunday we sleep
Lost in space to the dawns grief give me
Another galaxy to learn into a century our passion
Became smoke, seasons of tears I'll not see lost
Memories, live travel
