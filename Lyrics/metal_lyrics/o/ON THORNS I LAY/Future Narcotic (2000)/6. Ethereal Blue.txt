Maybe I lose you
But I touch the moon
In your hair I left moment
Like god I'll fly to ethereal blue
Light my way searching for you

Forgetting the sunsets of our soul
And touching with cold hands the starlight
Don't betray your immortality
And give me the fire of your eternity

And I hide the good sense in my heart
Helping the illusion to escape
Its dawning and the serenity of skies
Like the joy of world
Genesis of velvet darkness will follow
The mast of grief broken
To the affliction of lost
Caress we die...
