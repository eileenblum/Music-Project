Another day I exist
The drug in my blood
The aquatic ballet
of dolphing in spacewater

You send me a miracle, an angels breath
Forgetfulness which hurts so deep
Movement to crowd is the sign of a new day

Like everything you see
From the spacecraft of your mind
Illusions of future narcotic
Felled with tears for the past

I feel so sad I look at you
For everything I betray
For everything I'll never see
Always we'll look for the past
The innocence
