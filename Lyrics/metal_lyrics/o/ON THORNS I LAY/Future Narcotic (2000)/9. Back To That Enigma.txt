You will tear the planet
Like enigma and will be
Great like eternal sea of stars
Tell me what you feel when our bodies
Are crucified and what you feel
When speak form karma
Keep the pictures your hearts
Rainbow and eveything you believe
If makes you happy

Blind to passion of illusion
Forever dying on the last
Hours of dream
Our god lost to ethereal visions
The poison of deep
The deepest sorrow
I couldn't sleep
Screaming for salvation and hope
Creating ways to heaven
This pain will never end
Until we understand our failure
Competing our decision
For southern meditation
Forgetting the sunset of our soul
And touching the starlight

Sounds like repetitions
Hear the aligns following
The space, the moments of infinity
Give me sensation my god
