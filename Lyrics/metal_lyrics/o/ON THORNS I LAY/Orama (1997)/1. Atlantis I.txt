Searching (for) beauty in my dreams,
Atlantis Once upon a time, what I saw,
Brought me despair, cause surrounding me,
There where, only blue waters...

Waves dancing and shining
In the cool breeze...

Atlantis on the bottom of the ocean,
Unexpressed eyes, my eyes...

I heard them awakening,
They were distant straggled voices,
I think I was alive
But the vision of them
Will follow me forever...

Atlantis...

I was overwhelmed by a sad
And unfortunate feeling,
An impression that my soul was conquered by
The darkness...

Once a slipt, with a ship
Into a dark see
Whilst a shyttle rain,
I reached deep,
Under the earth (into a different world)...
