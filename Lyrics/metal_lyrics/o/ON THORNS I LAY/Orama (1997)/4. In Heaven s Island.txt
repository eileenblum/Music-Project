In heaven's island,
Under the gold flowers of the sun
Into a drop of water,
I feel my earthly lover...

Let me be in the romantic Middle age,
At the furthest beach in the universe

In heaven's island......

On the clouds in the sky,
Take my drama far away,
Whilst my kindness and my feelings
Beat the darkness

In heaven's island,
Under the gold flowers of the sun
