I follow a passion so dreamy
So optimistic,
Like waking up from a deep sleep...
I feel the aura

It transforms the numb feelings
Into thoughts... so dreamy thoughts

Flying in the clouds
I feel the aura

A sweet angel of hope in an unlimited
Period of lust and Harmony
It transforms the numb feelings
Into thoughts

Flying in the clouds...

I liked to escape into the embracement of sleep,
There I found the beauty in the dreams
Amidst ancient gardens and magical forests
Under strange stars in a sleep journey

Flying in the clouds...
