As I learn to fly,
Like the white bird of the sea
I feel the immortal magic of the Etherial
With sun glowing,
Sun Glowing like gold

Shine - like the sun
Fly - to the stars

Life is the unknown in the feast
Of this gears beauty
In the non dimension rainbow

If I could flyShine...

Frequently I see things in the air,
Sad visions,
Invisible for the masses to see...

And the sense of a flower
Brings them into deep thoughts

If I could fly

Shine...
