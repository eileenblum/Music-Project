In the magic mirror of my soul,
I stare at the person that I love,
It's the magical carpet on which,
I travel on the erebus,
In the land of fairy tales

So I close my eyes again
Feeling so lonely in the rain
The mother of sunrise gives hope
She can fly me over green fields
And...
The great oceans away from
Days of hatred and despair...

I saw immortal roses
And a gold field with giant trees
That shined immensely...
I saw ancient walls and palaces everywhere...
Amidst ancient gardens and magical trees...

So I close my eyes again...
