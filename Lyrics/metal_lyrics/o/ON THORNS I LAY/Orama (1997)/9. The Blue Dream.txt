Shadows of beauty here in the sin of love
I close my eyes and breath
Passion for life
One voice, one body learns to love
A simple thought for life is enough,
The mood becomes a temptation,
The temptation a longing
And the longing evolves in an unbeatable need
This need is the blue dream

Towards a great sadness
We are not always here
We burn in zeal and give wings
To our soul for the blue dream
It means the start of our happiness whilst
It sweetly rises to our soul

Shadows of beauty...
