The heat of love, that inflame my heart
comes to the deepest of my soul

Rainy days
It's so deep the reality...
but maybe the dream will continue,
a romantical dream, a spring water into the deserted
I feel lost to fall into the abyss
Far away from the human love,
but so close to the beauty of the real life

Rainy days
Believe to yourself, if you wanna you got it
The future is in our hands, free your heart to the paradisiac land
Sometimes my consideration,
travel to the mountain and the fossils of an unknown century
But I bring your hand to my face,
I see the tombs to shine to the lost beaming of the sun,
of your sun
Rainy days
Rainy days
