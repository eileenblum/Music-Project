To the gate of paradise,
as angels lisp the hymn of life,
perfumes and screams of people,
inundate this night.

My God give me power
to live again the scene
where I'll kiss her
and then so sweet I'll die.

Oh... it's so simple to come here again,
to come here again
I could have my machine of time
to come back again,
to live for one more time,
to be late the moment
before the separation

Oh... my crazy mind,
invited from feeling of love and admiration...
As I ascend the mountain
which always I was fearing
and I search for the unknown
which always was challenging the dread

It's a whole story of the summer
and overflows me with fall of joy
All days could be a summer
like a magic night
to the seashore with you
and the favorable wind
to reel your hair

Birds transport cheerful message
and follow us everywhere
A sparrow dances, under the sun, a sparrow dances
See them to be influenced from our romance
and the melody of hapiness take away their solitude...
