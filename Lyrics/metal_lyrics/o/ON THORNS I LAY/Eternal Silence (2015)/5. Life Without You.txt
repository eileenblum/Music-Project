Feels like it's broken I know that pain
What truth was spoken, who bares the blame?
Did I fake up stories for you?

Got no change to be there beside you
Talking about life without you, brakes me
We're many miles apart too
Can't reach you, can't find you

Feels like it's over I know that pain
You're trying to forget
Was it all in vein?
Did I fake up stories for you?
