Two days remained before you fall down
Your sorrow makes you breathing down
Breathing...

Before the darkest day of your soul
An element of soul's deepest (side)
I know the sourchday of our fall
I'm trying...knowing it's coming...

You're crude, you are good times wil show
Your weakness I know yes I know
It's time for your show but the stage feels so cold
Your weakness I know but it's time to go...

Time for your show, time for you to go...
