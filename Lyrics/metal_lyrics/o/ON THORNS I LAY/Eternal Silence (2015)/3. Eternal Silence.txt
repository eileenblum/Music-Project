I guess I didn't want to know, didn't want to face what was happening
Waiting your embrace, longing for your hand
To touch me deep, but the knife was sharp
It tore my heart in two...

I'd never thought I'd fear to give my heart to you
You broke it once and now I have to see the truth
We never change, you'll never change

Makes me wanna rage, love always has to hurt?
