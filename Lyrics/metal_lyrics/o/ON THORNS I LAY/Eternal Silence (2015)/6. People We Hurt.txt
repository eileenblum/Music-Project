Trying to escape in miracles of fantasy that I manage to create in meâ¦
Now Iâm falling in deep sleepâ¦
Standing all alone waiting for me to give you the air to breathe
But I just kept it all for me
How cruel Iâve been with you, I just hope one day youâll forgive me
This canât be real, wake me upâ¦ What are those voices, who are you?
âDonât be afraid, girl, we are here to help you
Listen to our advice never compromise, we wonât hurt youâ
Just face the truth, for your own good
Donât hurt those who care about you
War of thoughts in my head makes me wish I was dead
You are so pure and kindâ¦ Take him away from me
Just face the truth, for your own good
Donât hurt those who care about you
Donât care, donât know, donât hurt those who care about youâ¦
Fallingâ¦ Just hope one day youâll forgive me
