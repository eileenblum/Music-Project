Imagine how it would be if we had only one day to live...
Imagine hours passing like years over our skin
The sun comes up and by the night it's our last time on this earth
Would then life be less complicated?
What if we had one day to live?
Humanity would not have any essence of existence
Loving...Hating would be just words unknown for us
The pain would hurt only our flesh for this I would stand for
Panic froze it all my inside only by imagining
