"Laid across the line, lies in winter. His sadness is a frost, his face ugly as hate, beneath the colors of sunlight, his eyes a sign of sadness, send me a message of hope, take me in dreams, where the clouds will cover all those that you promise, like the black sun, plunging perilously, into the eternal sea. At the end of another day. Yearning to lead, they seek their desire, I suddenly found a starfish. Life and death, death of our brother."
