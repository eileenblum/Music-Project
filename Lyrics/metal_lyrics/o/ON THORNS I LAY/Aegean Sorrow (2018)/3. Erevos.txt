Kiss of rose do not take with you
And let the gift of pain with you
Truth with blood will feed your soul
But how can you see the lament of souls?
My God, forever with you
My God, forever with you
And suddenly from heaven's cloud
We see the truth,
the flowers of fear
My God, forever with you
My God, forever with you
Erevos, dropping in melancholy
