Olethros
So beautiful and proud like the dawn
Will rise in the first colors of the skies
You'll always be alone
Empty as your soul
You'll always be alone
Olethros
The path of loneliness I see
You'll always be alone
Empty as your soul

You'll always be alone
The years of innocence we left behind.
It s better to submit ourselves
"Under the sun and moon, sadness, the blue of the waves, like the eternal sea of feelings, alone in seasons of hate, dreaming the new age of humans, cries to the emptiness, tears of last breath in eternity."
