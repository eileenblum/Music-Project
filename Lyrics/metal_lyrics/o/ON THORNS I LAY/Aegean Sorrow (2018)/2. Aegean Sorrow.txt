My melancholy
Bleeding art
Exercising into the silence of the night

When monks fear the moon
And lovers lie hug with their grief

From the depths of their hearts
From the end of mankind

A silent scream
Licking at your skin
Emotions flow as the autumn sets

From the depths of hope
From the depths of sorrow
From the depths of hope
From the depths of sorrow

Aegean sorrow
Aegean sorrow
Aegean sorrow
Aegean sorrow

From the depths of hope
From the depths of sorrow
From the depths of hope
From the depths of sorrow

Aegean sorrow
Aegean sorrow
Aegean sorrow
Aegean sorrow
