He lives with melancholy beauty 'til the end
He must die. And the joy that always burns inside
The hand to her lips and is ready
To say goodbye. In emerald eyes.
Near by the desire of pleasure
Poison always turns to you
Inside the temple of pleasure
We live together as one
Together as one
In emerald eyes.
And it is from all the far
For a new world in solitude
Far away from here I ll rise
From darkness, you ll see.
One day, will rise the sun.
The flame that burns inside
A labyrinth of deepest emotions
Clear as crystal it stands
A hand is all you need
To get you through the past
