What if I described you my only dream?
What if I should tell you what is real?
Would you be prepared to hear the truth?
Could you be brave enough to listen?

Walking on filthy roads I got insane.
Reveal me one reason for the pain.
Now the world is changing I feel alone.
My youth died for my aging.  

When I close my eyes everything is getting better...
...My only dream

I can dream and I can ride the wave.
Violent nightmares stop me when I 'm awake.
I never dreamed of such a dirty fight.
Life can be so frightening

When I close my eyes everything is getting better...
