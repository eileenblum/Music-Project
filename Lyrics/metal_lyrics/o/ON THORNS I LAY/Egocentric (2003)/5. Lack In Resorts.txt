Stay here
live up to 
what we
believed in
the moments we cried
when our love died
when you arrived.

Stay with me in this
time to remember
Let us be in this
garden forever
All my life
I've waited this moment to come
This dust now just fucks up my mind

We are
your questions.
You are
our answers.
Build up
the prison
in which
we dream of
the things we can buy
in order to fly
to the place where we can hide

Stay with me in this
time to remember
Let us be in this
garden forever
All my life
I've waited for this moment to come
This dust now just fucks up my mind

Stay!

we can hide from...

Seems we are solid but we
are just afraid, crawling.

They can't escape it
They smile but they fake it
There is nothing to carry them all safe back home

Father I need you
Where are you?
I miss you now that I need your love that makes me feel strong
