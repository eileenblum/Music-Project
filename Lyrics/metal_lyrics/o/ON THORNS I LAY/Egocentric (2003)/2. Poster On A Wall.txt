I can feel her calling me again
There is no voice but picture only 
then I can't pretend I 'm just a man

Faith.
Could I find her?
Pain,
Must be stronger.
Isn't she for real,
drowning in my fear?

I can feel her messing with my brain.
Should I fuck her while I 'm still insane?
I cannot tell or I don't care.

Faith.
Could I find her?
Pain.
Must be stronger.
Isn't she for real,
drowning in my fear?

Now.
Could I have her?
Lying in my bedroom
she can be a wave,
ride it 'cause you are brave.

Kill me! After all I 'm done with my
practicing on human kind.
Kill me and forgive me if I 'm not that strong
but I 'm alone.

You hear me calling 
as you swim against the tide.
Some stars are falling
I invite you for a ride.
The fall does matters
but collision is what counts
You fear the latter 
You could never reach your bounds.
