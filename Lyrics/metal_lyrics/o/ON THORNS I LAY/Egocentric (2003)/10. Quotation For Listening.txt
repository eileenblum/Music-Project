Help me. Will you?
Tell me. Will you?
This can be my last 
searching in the past.

Put the blame on 
my obsessions.
I have tried so much tonight 
the moment seemed so right

Help me. Will you?
Be my lover.
I don't think you 're nice
'cause I have to pay the price.

You are the only
one I have got here.
My loneliness in your room.
My time is up so soon.

I 'd charge you for an hour
I 'd charge you for a night
but this, beyond my power,
is touching me inside.
Some words are there for talking
some others cut like knife
Your presence everlasting
could cost you all your life.
