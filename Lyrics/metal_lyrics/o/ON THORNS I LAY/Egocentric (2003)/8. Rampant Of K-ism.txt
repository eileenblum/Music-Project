All there is now is bars, drugs and parties
All we are now ketamized and burned minds
Reaching out for friends can bring the light from paradise
that can warm up
cold-blooded people, the people, I 'm just yelling to

- WE 'RE GONNA GET NOW SPACED OUT!

Psychic days are gone I 'm asking for some more.

I 'm calling upon people

It's much too late to find the reason in our human minds
We've got to search behind forgotten back doors leading to
our innocence from lost lives
