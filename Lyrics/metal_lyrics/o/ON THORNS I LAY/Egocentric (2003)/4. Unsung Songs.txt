From all I've seen and all I've known
there is one song I sing no more
there is a pain from deep inside

For many years I felt so strong
a single tear I did not share.
I was that brave or I pretended?

and maybe I was just too young
and spent all my thoughts for fun
but I had only good intentions.

...But I found out...

Becoming someone else than me
was just the way it had to be
as I was searching for addictions.

The rope was tripping down my throat 
and she was never ending hope
but even her true love got weaker.

...and I cry now...

I meet myself again!
- Hold on
I 'm making no mistakes this time.

See me crying again!
- Don't go
I have to be myself this time.
