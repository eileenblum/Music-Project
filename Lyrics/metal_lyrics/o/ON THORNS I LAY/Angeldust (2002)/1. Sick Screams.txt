The shadowless street
smelled dry as sand you see the
sunshine behind my life
Let me listen to this do you mind ?
You'll cry again lonely in the dark
And you will rise throught all the sick screams
I thought the last times forgotten in my word
A break of life everytime stay alone
What I see is real ?
I don't really know
A lie so true and fake
A vision is dying today in my brain
