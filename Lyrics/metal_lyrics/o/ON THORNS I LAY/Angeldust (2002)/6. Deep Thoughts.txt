I speak to you like a frieland, a beck fray full of fame
Flames of hesitation today we'll see
Yearning after groans of pain I exult for me win a fad of
sorrow is coming from future to you
Blue horizons touch the limit of beauty like forgotten angels
into a paradise of your oceans
Like I prayer that breaks the time I leave everything back
The key of life I search falling forever
Deep thoughts of limitless dimensions blow my mind
Pride for (centuries)
we meditate our dreams forever
Celestial season
we find our peace to heaven
A touch for miracle like immortal kiss of hope
