Can you feel my pain ?
I leave me hands to you
I'm coming to an end and
everything will be so real

What you mean to me you see
moments that sign in time again
because everything pains me deep
False hopes pain and death
Never been able to read me
for everything that suffered me
because everything pains me deep
Ashes forever will be
