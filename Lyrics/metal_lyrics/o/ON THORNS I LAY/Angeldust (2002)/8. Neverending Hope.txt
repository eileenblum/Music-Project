I don't search for nothing in my life
as I close my soul in cold rain words of fears
Said me that you'll travel away from light
having no desire in this crazy fucking world
Don't betray your fate find your secret self
is coming up to you
It is getting strange every single day
and might be so true
Finally at the end is so hard to feel
my emotions and these screams in me sleep
Hidden secrets send me warning of damnation
No more drugs to find a new way
