Finally what you are is the same that we are everyone
You do infeasible dreams, like everyone you will learn to love if you learn to
suffer, like everyone
So discover the snake of your soul, think deeper Discover the joy of your life
think deeper
The way is an opened to the violet
The knowledge of your self please find yourself
Grey loves my God, sinked me in pain, my hearted body will soon expire, I will
be waiting
