Sometimes were two, were two and was like one, One and so mnay together, among
capids and angels, we will fly forever...
I have a mystic relation with the moon
Tonight, I will sprink moondust only for you...
The biggest distance is the time so live for the moment
I am afraid the same as you but I am dreaming...
We are hunting each other into the fragrant valley of sensations and illusions
So let your mind free...
