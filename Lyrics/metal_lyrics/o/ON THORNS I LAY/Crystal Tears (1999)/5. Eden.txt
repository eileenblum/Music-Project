Red wine I drink and to the golden coast I sing...
Everything you search in your life here you will find
Don't loose your mind, don't let the time to take you far away you have to
find a better way, you forgive every wrong of your mind illusions of your life
I have to teach you everything, everytime these hands are your angels
Touch the skies...
I am falling help me
I am falling save me
Everything you search in your life here you will find suffering hoping.
Searching the virtues of your lonely heart.
Don't swear your trouble don't sleep heavily, you are in deep mourning.
You are not here however so sad I look at you so tired, so alone, my Eden
