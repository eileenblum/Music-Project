I don't know if we are something between god and demon
Weak mortals, transient beings doing invisible dreams
Eternal I will not lament as I am falling deep to your fears
My angel help me, feel me
As I am falling with tears tor thousand of years lost into sensations and
etherial desires?
I am here like everyone and I will stay forever
