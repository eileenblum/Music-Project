I wonder if I have to believe in something better, I sleep heavily into the
cold of my pain or I travel to eternity...
Through seasons of passions open your eyes, just try to be yourself
Nothing will change, if you stay dumb, just open your eyes
I walk around the paths of my mind bleeding slowly in irrational words
I saw my self, into unknown I have to stay sometimes alone
