In my hands a hope I hold
And to your breath's dew
I will be unable to sleep
In my hands a wave I hold and your body I describe, and beside you I come day
and night.
I travel into the (blue) seas of your mind I will overtake you to the seventh
wave where the moon rests a caress I will give you
Feelings
I touch your dry skin, I discover the infinity in your eyes and the line from
the pulse of your heart, I touch...
