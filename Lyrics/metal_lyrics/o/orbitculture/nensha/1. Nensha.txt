Pick up the bones

In stone it stands written
It's taken hundred years
The fires to come
The living dead

In bones that's been hidden
For more than centuries

A flashback in time
The birth of a sickness in me

Leaving this world into pieces
Taking the blood from the dead
Eating the skulls of her victims
Feeding her birds from the breast

Hold on to life
Falling through ice

Slitting the throat of her victims
Drinking the blood from her dead
Eating the life of her victims
Keeping the mind, unsurfaced

The crows let me hear them
Singing the hymns of death
The woman to come
The demon breath

The path of the lone ones
She knows that it's someone here

You're trespassing her grounds
Letting your demons right in here

Nensha

In here
A flashback in time
The birth of a sickness in me

Hold on to life
Falling through ice
Scarred by all life
Nothing seems right

Beware of yourself darkness drinker
Touched by thorns of minds hell
I am the one who is building
My nightmares my fears unsurfaced

I'm the demon of our time.
I'm the frozen ghost in hell
I'm the demon in the sky

We are the leaders in hell
We are the leaders of all

I am the lone wolf in all
And I'm reaching for you too

Pushing through hell
Rumbling away here
Beware of yourself
The hammer won't lift itself

Beware of this dark
It's only in your head
Beware of yourself
The hammer won't lift itself

The path of the lone ones
The gates have been opened

The ships leaving shores now
Ready to strike now

You'll die
