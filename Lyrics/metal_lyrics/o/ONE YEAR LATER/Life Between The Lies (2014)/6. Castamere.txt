It's gonna bury you
It's gonna bury me
Cold earth
Surrounding every rotting tree
It's gonna bury you
It's gonna bury me
Branches pushing through the dirt
Sing the eulogy
Go

Push crooked daggers
Bleeding eyes will wake you up

As the night watches over me
Through the secrets that I must keep
Hold my hand as I fall asleep
Tell me I will wake again

It's gonna bury you
It's gonna bury me
Cold earth
Surrounding every rotting tree
It's gonna bury you
It's gonna bury me
Branches pushing through the dirt
Sing the eulogy

[Chorus:]
As the night watches over me
Through the secrets that I must keep
Hold my hand as I fall asleep
Tell me I will wake again

I watched the stars explode
Against the blackest night
To see the light of day
I suffer through the night
I need to break
Break the spell
That's haunting me
I lie awake
Always living in a dream

I know that all I have to give
Isn't giving enough
Giving enough
I had a dream last night
It was storming and cold
And you were pulling on my legs
With every inch of your soul
And as your eyes slowly slid
To the back of your head
I whispered in your ear
That you're better off dead

[Chorus 2x:]
As the night watches over me
Through the secrets that I must keep
Hold my hand as I fall asleep
Tell me I will wake again

When the night is dark
And full of terror
The waiting will wear you down
When everyone you know
Has lost their way
I will make you pay
(I will make you pay)

I had a dream last night
Burned them all
Burned them all
Burned them all

I had a dream last night
Burned them all
Burned them all
Burned them fucking all

[Chorus 2x:]
As the night watches over me
Through the secrets that I must keep
Hold my hand as I fall asleep
Tell me I will wake again
