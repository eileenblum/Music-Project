So let me tell you
What we fear the most
That love is nothing
We're just chasing ghosts
And yeah, the truth hurts
But the lies do too
And we're just half liars
Half painful truth

So let me tell you
What I fear the most
That we're just searching
For a nameless ghost
And when the
Lights dim on our waking lives
We're all just shadows
In a thin disguise

And the vines will tangle
Like a noose around your neck
And the world will wither
Like a starving final breath
And you can't win
Eyes will twist and kiss the wind
It's slowly happening
Everything you never should be

We all sleep in burning bedrooms
We singe our secrets
To stifle the weight that grows

St-st-stifle the weight that grows
To stifle the weight that grows

[2x:]
We suffer by the hands we love
We suffer by the hands
Of the ones we love

We suffer by the hands we love
But can't turn away from

So let me tell you
What I fear the most
That we're just searching
For a nameless ghost
And when the
Lights dim on our waking lives
We're all just shadows
In a thin disguise

And the vines will tangle
Like a noose around your neck
And the world will wither
Like a starving final breath
And you can't win
Eyes will twist and kiss the wind
It's slowly happening
Everything you never should be

We suffer by the hands we love
We suffer by the hands
Of the ones we love
We suffer by the hands we love
But can't turn away from

We suffer
We suffer
We suffer by the hands
Of the ones we love
We suffer by the hands we love
But can't turn away from
