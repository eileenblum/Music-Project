I'm burying everything you said
As the words cross your lips
And pollute every part of my head
Make amends, make amends
Fake a smile and pretend
Say it to my fucking face

You're just another pretty face
I'll find another one
To fill the empty space
And with everything I have
I'll crush you
Find that heart inside your chest
And crush it too

[Chorus:]
You play these games
You know you'll never win
You cut my heart
And let the wolves rush in
You play these games
You know you'll never win
And you know I'm not invisible

Take those lies you spit out
Shove them down your throat
I'm gonna watch every step you take
Haunt you like a ghost

Haunt you like a ghost
Cause you looked me in the eye
And you straight-face lied
You fucking bitch
You fucking bitch

And you know
It's just the games you play

[Chorus:]
You play these games
You know you'll never win
You cut my heart
And let the wolves rush in
You play these games
You know you'll never win
And you know I'm not invisible

This is for the time you betrayed me
This is for the time
Something is wrong
Onside of my head
It blankets in darkness
And burns all the rest
Something is right inside of my chest
But I have found
There's nothing left

You said forever
You said forever
You said forever
You said forever
I watch your eyes fade in time
As the color drains away from mine
I swear to God we all fucking die
You said forever
You said for... fuck

[Chorus 2x:]
You play these games
You know you'll never win
You cut my heart
And let the wolves rush in
You play these games
You know you'll never win
And you know I'm not invisible
