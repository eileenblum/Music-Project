We are dead

We are dead
We are the dying elephants
In the room
Carving words on our tomb
As the fear grows inside of you

Yeah, yeah
Shatter the silence
Cause yeah, we're young
And we're violent

Cause yeah, we're young
And we're violent

[Chorus 2x:]
And I know
Every single time
I'm waiting for disaster
Life is moving faster now

We are dead

We are dead
We are the ones
With nothing else left to lose
Shattered, broken, and bruised
As the fear grows inside of you

Yeah, yeah
Shatter the silence
Cause yeah, we're young
And we're violent

Cause yeah, we're young
And we're violent

[Chorus 2x:]
And I know
Every single time
I'm waiting for disaster
Life is moving faster now

How could this be so simple
And what have you done?
I'm tasting your blood
On the tip of my tongue
Watching your breath
As it fades away into me
Into me

Do you remember
The first time you saw it?
The sinking feeling
You felt in your stomach?

We are dead

Do you remember
The first time you saw it?
The sinking feeling
You felt in your stomach?

[Chorus 2x:]
And I know
Every single time
I'm waiting for disaster
Life is moving faster now

How could this be so simple
And what have you done?
I'm tasting your blood
On the tip of my tongue
Watching your breath
As it fades away into me
Into me
