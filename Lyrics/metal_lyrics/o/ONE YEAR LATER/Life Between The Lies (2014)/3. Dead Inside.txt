I've got a mouth full of roses
That cover the cuts
There's thorns in my cheeks
Where the skin turned to rust
With lips around flowers
Is all that you see
I'm dying to spit it out
We're all dead inside

We're all dead inside
We're all dead inside and you know it
We're painting our faces
To try not to show it
Over and over the work never ends
I'm digging in circles
I break before bend

[Chorus:]
We don't remember the lender
That sold our soul
We just remember the painter
That brushed us gold

I'm ripping my hair out
To use as a brush
I've run out of colors
To use as a crutch
I'm painting a picture
With words I can't say
But look on the inside
We're all black and gray
We're all dead inside and you know it

[Chorus:]
We don't remember the lender
That sold our soul
We just remember the painter
That brushed us gold

I've been searching my whole life
For something with meaning
But all I found was bleeding
All I found was bleeding
I've been looking my whole life
For something of worth
But there's nothing but dirt
Nothing but dirt

How can we live when we die every day?
How can we live when we die every day?
How can we live when we die every day?
How can we live when we die every day?
How can we live when we die every day?
How can we live...

(Fuck it)

Yeah

[Chorus 2x:]
We don't remember the lender
That sold our soul
We just remember the painter
That brushed us gold
