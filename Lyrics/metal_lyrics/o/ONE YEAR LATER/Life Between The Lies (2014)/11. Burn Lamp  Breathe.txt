It's time to wake up
We're leaving no man behind
When the cloud of smoke clears
You'll be hearing it one time

We will, we will burn it down
Words are broken while they're spoken
When you hit the ground
We will, we will find the top
Those who fight it
Are invited to make us stop

[Chorus:]
We can't sleep
There's a light on
That burns and breathes
And it screams louder and louder to me
Can't sleep
There's a light on
That burns and breaths
And it screams louder and louder

we all have demons
Watching every step we take
Letting them win
Is just a choice we make
Consumed by a world
That wants me cold
But I have chosen
To ignite every tired soul

We will, we will burn it down
Words are broken while they're spoken
When you hit the ground
We will, we will find the top
Those who fight it
Are invited to make us stop

[Chorus:]
We can't sleep
There's a light on
That burns and breathes
And it screams louder and louder to me
Can't sleep
There's a light on
That burns and breaths
And it screams louder and louder

We will, we will
We will, we will

[2x:]
We are the new ones
The revolution
And though we hobble
We are one step closer

Get the fuck out

I promise you there will be blood
There will be blood

[Chorus:]
We can't sleep
There's a light on
That burns and breathes
And it screams louder and louder to me
Can't sleep
There's a light on
That burns and breaths
And it screams louder and louder
