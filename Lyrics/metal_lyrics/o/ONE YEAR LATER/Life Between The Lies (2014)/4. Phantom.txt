Your shadow still haunts me

Every night in my dreams
Silhouettes in the darkest scenes
Unhappy endings playing on repeat
Is anybody out there listening?
Give and take, give and take
Struggle to bend and not break

Lost myself in the woods for days
Long the way I found your grave
At the edge of the lake

[Chorus:]
And I found your grave
At the edge of the lake
All that I had
I traded for fortunate fate
And I found your grave
At the edge of the lake
All that I had
I traded for everything
Trade it for fortunate fate

Go

Flooding my lungs
With words left unsaid
I'm just drowning in the undertow
And I will drown myself in pain
For just one more day
Til the chains around my throat
Split and break away
And I will dwell within the dead
For the waking life
'Cause the death of love is real
But we live out the lie

[2x:]
Yeah, I will dwell within the dead

[Chorus:]
And I found your grave
At the edge of the lake
All that I had
I traded for fortunate fate
And I found your grave
At the edge of the lake
All that I had
I traded for everything
Trade it for fortunate fate

[3x:]
Please tell me why love has to die
