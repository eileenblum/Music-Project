I want it all
You can shake the pain
You can walk away from the fall
You gotta let go
You gotta let go
I want it all
You can make a change
You can take the shame from it all
It's time to let go
It's time to let go

I want to stifle all the words
That bleed
And wear them on my sleeve
And show them all to the wasted
Souls haunting everything they see
And just to make ends meet
We burn the rope
In our constant grief

[Chorus 2x:]
You held me up
Above the water
Kept me afloat through endless waves

And when the world is bleak
Your soul sinks beneath the sea
I can't find
The way to serenity
But in you
I found a place I could wander to
A slower path
To resting under the crystal blue
Now I'm ready let the waves take me in
Wash the cracks from my soul
Where the scars would have been

[Chorus 2x:]
You held me up
Above the water
Kept me afloat through endless waves

[5x:]
We all stand hand in hand
Hand in hand
