So light the flame
And pretend it will warm you
Cause I'm displacing the ice
Thatâs inside your veins
Youâll see the fire
Inside of my cold eyes
Watch me watch you
As your life slips away
Fuck you

Twisted tongues will haunt you
So rip it out
Before you fucking choke on it

[Chorus:]
You can't wait to cut me open
Cut me open now
And when you dwell in your disguise
Can't see the truth in all your lies

Slithering like snakes
Through my insides
I never knew
You were capable of these lies
I had hoped they were only nightmares
Watch me watch you
As your dreams fade away

Through the eyes of the blind
You see the world in the shallow grave
That you dig for yourself
With your selfish words
And the lies you make

[Chorus:]
You can't wait to cut me open
Cut me open now
And when you dwell in your disguise
Can't see the truth in all your lies

Take it back
Take it back, motherfucker
So take back the words
Sleep in your silence
Insincere hollow minded guidance
I will take back everything
Weah
So take back your words
Sleep in your silence now

[Chorus:]
You can't wait to cut me open
Cut me open now
And when you dwell in your disguise
Can't see the truth in all your lies

You can't see the truth in your lies
