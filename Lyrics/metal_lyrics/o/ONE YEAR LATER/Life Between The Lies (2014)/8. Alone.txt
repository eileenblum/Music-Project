Face first in the cold hard ground
I run in circles
Just to find my way out
Let this pain wash over me
I built these walls too high
For the world to see

I'm dead on the inside
When you are not here
My demons all know
That I'm facing my fear
Your essence surrounds me
It's all of my being
I'm walking alone
In what I thought was a dream

Choke, choke the air that you breathe
Choke, choke the life out of me
But who was there to see
That they don't bleed like me?
I'm all alone

[Chorus:]
I'm all alone
Been watching the stars come down
As shadows we crawl
Up to the blinding light
Walk with me tonight

Choke, choke the air that you breathe
Choke, choke the life out of me
But who was there to see
That they don't bleed like me?

Face first in the cold hard ground
I run in circles
Just to find my way out
Let this pain wash over me
I built these walls too high
For the world to see

[Chorus:]
I'm all alone
Been watching the stars come down
As shadows we crawl
Up to the blinding light
Walk with me tonight
I'm all alone
Been watching the stars come down
Walk with me tonight
As shadows we crawl
Up to the blinding light
Walk with me tonight

I was born alone
And I will die alone
Breaking foundations
To the broken homes
And when the mirror tells me
What I can't be
I am my own worst enemy

[Chorus:]
I'm all alone
Been watching the stars come down
As shadows we crawl
Up to the blinding light
Walk with me tonight
I'm all alone
Been watching the stars come down
Walk with me tonight
As shadows we crawl
Up to the blinding light
Walk with me tonight
