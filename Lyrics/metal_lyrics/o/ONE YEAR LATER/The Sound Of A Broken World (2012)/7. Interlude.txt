Reaching out to the sunset
holding onto every illusion
And though i've weathered the storm now
I am merely a passenger in this world

I've seen the rain wash the color from paintings
Though the path does stay it's course
I've worn my skin and my clothing to tatters
And missed the wind on my face as time stood still

As I stare into the abyss
eluding the harsh reality of fate
I feel the cold grip of death
Like glaciers in my veins
sending shivers through my core
and leaving me empty, hollow, and wanting

I welcome the sting of life
for I am but an empty vessel
attempting to find my place in the world
There is far to much to be done
And though I fear I may be broken beyond repairâ¦
I would rather live than quit
I would rather live
