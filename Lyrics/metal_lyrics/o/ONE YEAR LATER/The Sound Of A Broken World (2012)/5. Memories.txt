Black the sky, turn the sun down, I am writing alone with my wounds
I'll never see your face again
Sands of time, come to claim you, resting deep in the hands of the Earth
I'll never hear you breathe my friend
I'm always with you, You're always with me

I see you in my life, I see you in my memories
And I will remember, still remember you
I see you in my dreams, I see you in the subtleties
And I will remember, still remember you

This death will separate us
we walk until the end, while never losing sight

(Ricky Armellino of This or the Apocalypse)
I, I'm gonna plant my feet in the Earth
I'm gonna keep my fist towards the sky
You are my brightest fucking star
I know I'll never get lost

You will never be forgotten, and when you left I lost a part of me
