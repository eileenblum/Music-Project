How can you look at yourself in the mirror?
and not hate the fuck you've become?
Your reflection is becoming clearer, turn away from the things that you've done

How could I welcome you hear into my life, with open arms
only to see you fall apart
in front of my eyes
how, can you live with your shallow reflection
constantly hide your intentions
and now I see, the knife that you wield is heading straight for me

I can see right through your reflection
mirrors show your facade, and you won't find your redemption
till you realize your life is a (Lie)
Liar, deceiver, I'll watch you burn
I'll scatter the ashes and shatter the urn

I'll watch you burn, before my eyes, I'll see you lay in this earth
You'll take it back, with your last breath, but I don't care anymore

Fuck you!

I am surrounded by everything
I am surrounded by everything
that I hate

You are nothing more than a frame
to a house that is burning down
and as I look through the ruins
all I found is your (lies)
Liar, deceiver, I'll watch you burn
I'll scatter the ashes and shatter the urn
