Please just break me
Take me for all that I am
Won't you save me?
This road that we walk is devoid of exit signs

I never said that this road would be easy
if you're not careful you'll stumble and fall
I know it's hard but you have to believe me
This bond we share will prevail after all

I'm pushing through miles and miles of dirt
hoping to find the ground
Leaving my home, but never alone,
with the love in the brothers I've found

This road, this road, will carry us home

You think you can stop us?
Well I'd like to see you try!

Follow me into this world

We're here for all to see
and we've built eternity
