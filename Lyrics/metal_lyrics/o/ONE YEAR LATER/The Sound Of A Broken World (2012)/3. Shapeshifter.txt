Awaken the dead, you never lived in the first place
you'll carry my name, I wanted this in the worst way
I need to hear the truth, In every breath
as I wrap my noose around your neck
Breathe, the life out of me
you give me more than i'm willing to see

Seeing, believing, that I never knew you at all
And every time that we fall, I'm losing it all

We're sinking the ship, cause there's no sight of the shoreline
the masts are in shreds, we've weathered more than a lifetime
I need more room to grow

Crack all my bones, arrange all the shards, empty me out, I'm condemned and torn apart

And don't cry to me, when you realize you've exhausted your chances
I won't be there for the rest of your life, and the clock is ticking so stop wasting my time

The fear inside my throat it grows, it's choking me, my words can barely breathe
my words can barely breathe
