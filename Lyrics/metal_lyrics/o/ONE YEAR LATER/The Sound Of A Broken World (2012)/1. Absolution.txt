I'm becoming a shadow, dying to see the light
How could you make me so hollow? There's nothing left, there's nothing left of me
Oh, brother, you betrayed me, flesh of my flesh and the blood of my blood
My skin is decaying, peel me apart and release the void in side

Finding a shadow and losing the light, becoming the darkness and losing my sight
lost and I'm broken I'm wasting the day, I'll never find what was taken from me

Falling apart, on the inside, breaking my back so that I can breathe
Losing myself, on the outside, pull out my eyes so that I can see

Oh Brother, I remember, absolving ourselves from the sins we've made
My hands, are in ruins, eaten away from my darkest days

I'm becoming a shadow, losing the light

Break your neck, you fucking owe it to yourself
bite your tongue, as you choke upon your filth
