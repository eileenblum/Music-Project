As I begged and bartered on the streets of hell
you gave me nothing had no truth to tell
I believed everything you said
you've mislead me, i've lost my way

You made me believe, I had nothing better that I was alone
You had me deceived, that you were the one that I should be striving to please

We search for some deeper meaning
Escape from this feeling of doubt
This hate has been making it's way
from the time that love has begun

I've made my stand tonight
you will not be the death of me
I've made my stand tonight,
I'm leaving you for good
These are my eyes, open wide, open wide, open wide
now I can see your fucking disease
