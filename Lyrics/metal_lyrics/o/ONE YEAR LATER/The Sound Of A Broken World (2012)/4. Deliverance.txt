Knee deep and sinking
waves crash upon my chest
I close my eyes, I gasp for air, let the tide take me away
As I turn my back to you again and for the last time
this wall I built between us both is surely coming down

You pushed me back into a corner again
I've built this door from hope I'm leaving through it

[Chorus]
I pull my self, under the waves, embracing this hate you've built inside of me, inside of me,
I pull myself, under the waves, embracing this hate you've built, these waves crash down, on my chest

What we've lost, is coming back around
Judge me now

Remember my name, I'm walking forever away
