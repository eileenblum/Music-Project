Take all my pain away
flush it down the fucking drain
I've made my way

This is my chance to break the mold
and wash the blood from my hands
from my hands
I'm letting go
I'm letting go

Beneath this shallow skin
You but me deeply and
I'm bleeding out and the world has betrayed us

Take off the mask
there's no sense in hiding what you've become
Take all your lies
you have mislead me for the last fucking time

I see your face
I'm dying to hear the truth
I'm dying to hear the truth

WIll we ever break these chains that bind us?
Were we ever meant to kill this habit?
What shadows we've become
Another path to follow leading nowhere
In this battle will we ever win?
What monsters we've become
