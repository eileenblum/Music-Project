This is the sound, this is the sound of a broken world
I've left it all behind
Watch the sun, arising to the sound of desolation
I'm alone, with nothing but a silent world around me

Fall asleep to the sound of the entropy,
waking up with ashes for eyes
Watch the sky burn to dust right in front of me
How can I tell if I'm dead or alive

Leave my home
Walking through this barren fucking wasteland
Say goodbye
Cause everything you've known and loved has vanished

The hounds of hell are coming to mark my grave
All in all I am borrowed flesh, withered and cracked from the blood of others
All in all I am crumbling, In ruins I stand like forgotten monuments

As the daylight fades and nightfall finds me
I have found myself in sound and fury

I'm alone, with nothing but a silent world around me
