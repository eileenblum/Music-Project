Lying there in your own dark
World still alive and in pain
Trapped inside closed walls in your mind
Your ball and chain 'til death do you part again

Let me out of here
Let me be free

Starting at the mirror behind your eyes
Who is that you see
Lost in dreams in visions your own
All at once you see now you start to scream

Well I can't break free
From these walls surrounding
Someday I'll be
Who I am and not another

Now I'm feeling so insecure
Always running away from myself
Living a lie inside a prisoner of your own soul
Of your own soul

Slowly you walk down your beaten
Pathway a longer walk today
Still in bonds your own ropes holding
All alone you think of another way

But there's no escape
This false pretense that you're leading
Someday you'll be
Who. you are and not another

Now you feeling so insecure
Always running away from yourself
Living a lie inside a prisoner

Now can't you see this neverending circle
You will always travel
And it's time for you to break free
Another day another way
Will see you through your low existence
You are so all alone a prisoner
Of your own soul, of your own soul

You can't break free you're inside so all alone
The walls you put in your mind
This cell you call home
Desperate and so on the edge I see in your eyes
There's only one way out you'll find
Quit living the lies

There comes a time for decisions
I know
You cannot deny your heart's vision
Escape forever
