Will you see the light at the end of your dreams?
And will the sun be shining bright on you
Fly above this wasted world
And take a glance at reality
Somewhere there's a place worth going to
Not just a fantasy it's always there for you
In desperate times the signs are there just follow

Dark is the blood of the seas the churning waters
Wild this disease so disguised
So take another look around
And pick yourself up off the ground
Search for this place and you will find
Not just a fantasy it's always there for you
In desperate times the signs are there just follow

Your paradise is on the edge of the world
No need for a better place to hide
Your paradise is on the edge of the world
Someplace that you can all be free
Be free with me

I wish you could see where I see
These dark deceptions
There is another way for us to be
So don't wish for another place
Make your place worth living in and hold on
And you will recall this dream
Not just a fantasy it's always there for you
In desperate times the signs are there just follow

Your paradise is on the edge of the world
No need for a better place to hide
Your paradise is on the edge of the world
Someplace that you can all be free
Be free with me
