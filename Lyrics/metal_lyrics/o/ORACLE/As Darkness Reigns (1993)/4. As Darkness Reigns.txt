Look into your mind
See a picture of the place we had
So long ago
The world so fine
And Eden not so far away we had

But then we'd fall
Into another world
We'd face a living under a law
Born from society
And the end would come
A fate we chose to deny
In controversy
As darkness reigns

This storming night the end of time
Written history
The call no more signs or borderlines
Written means to be
The cries from the Gods fulfilling evolution
So helpless scream the divine
And dark was the light
Begin prayer to your deliverer
So cold was the world
Gone the light of day such a price to pay
Those, waging wars could never win
The land, the sea, the sky

Songs of life would be lost and forgotten
One time again the fruit of evil taken
Cleaning the world for a new beginning
But for a time darkness will reign

Dark was the light
Begin prayer to your deliverer
So cold was the world
Gone the light of day such a price to pay
Those, waging wars no one should ever win
The land, the sea, the sky

Songs of life would be lost and forgotten
One time again the fruit of evil taken
Cleaning the world for a new beginning
But for a time darkness will reign
