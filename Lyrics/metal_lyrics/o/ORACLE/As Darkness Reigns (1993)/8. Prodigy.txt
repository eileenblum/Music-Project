Well he was born in fusion with nature
And full of dreams he'd understand
With silent cries pouring his future
From melodies with golden hands

Do what you will this skill your dominion
No search for fame too young to know
And all the while your only companion
A ragged fiddle and a rosined bow

They would know the light you'd shine
All would see you are a prodigy

The skill would from learning starvation
A discipline you'd always know
The time would come a show of sensations
And you would make your deep run shallow

And like the wind across the country
Your presence rules in their open ears
They would hail this music beginning
And wouldn't care to know about the tears

You cried inside when all alone
They'd see you are a prodigy

Now they don't understand
And you're Satan's child
No excuse for the sound that you wield
There's no way that you do the things
God has given you
Taking away the mystery of it all

Now they're leading you here
And they're leading you there
Telling you that your skill does not apply
No just a gift from hell
Watching and waiting they're all under your spell

They would know the light you'd shine
All would see you are a prodigy

Well he was born in fusion with nature
And full of dreams he'd understand
With silent cries pouring his future
From melodies with golden hands

Do what you will this skill your dominion
No search for fame too young to know
And all the while your only companion
A ragged fiddle and a rosined bow

They would know the light you'd shine
All would see you are a prodigy
