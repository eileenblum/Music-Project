Listen now, you hear but you do not believe
There's a truth but deception seems
To always hold the key
Look into his dark eyes
And know the why behind his lies
This is one you will regret
All your dealings with

Falsehoods get caught in the way
Let the truth be the one that you'll pay
And you'll pay

You are one no one in a world of make believe
I can see the strain on your spiritual being
Deep, so deep is the hole
In which you must crawl out of
How does it feel to hold faith in lies
That you are made of

You always know just what to say
Let the truth be the one that you'll pay

There'll be one time in a landslide
Truth will reign over you
No one notices why be bothered
You yourself so untrue

Complications no relations
Ever walking alone
There's no way out,
But the key be all you can be
Gain my respect and don't try
To change what I can see
Don't involve all that's false
And your stories over
How does it feel to hold faith in lies?
That you are made of

You always know just what to say
Let the truth be the one that you'll pay
Falsehoods get caught in the way
Let the truth be the one that you'll pay

No faith for the liar
No faith for you

And in my eyes, I cannot see
Why you hide out from reality

Your life is so undercover
I'd see and you would not discover
In time and the world will find you
Untrue and lost forever

And in my eyes, I cannot see
Why you hide out from reality
