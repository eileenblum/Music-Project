This time a long time ago far away
In castles they'd rule population
Bearing steel, the knights held the border strong
Highest honors

Loyalty for their King and country
A kind of magic there
Battles would rage and the strong would survive
Life's always lost on the frontline

Fearless eyes shadowed souls
Knights of the Round Table

Holding fortress in measured armor
They stand so all alone
Fear is nothing for knights
With broadswords and banners flying high

Courage in forms no one would ever know
Strength their only salvation
Fearless eyes shadowed souls
Knights of the Round Table

And in death they'd never die
And for truth they'd all survive
All the pride showed in their eyes
All the faith would rule their lives
Now today is such on another time
No more knights to keep this world alive

So look inside your memories
The love and hate
There is knight in everyone
Just let him come forth

And when you feel his presence there
Don't turn and run oh no
The Knight is good, the Knight is fair
They're needed everywhere

Knights of the Round Table

Now the time has come
For the Knights to make a stand
To defend the land
And they will know when
The time has come to disappear
But they're always near

Fearless eyes shadowed souls
Knights of the Round Table

And in death they'd never die
And for truth they'd all survive
All the pride showed in their eyes
All the faith would rule their lives
Now today is such on another time
No more knights to keep this world alive
