Since you've been away
I've longed to hold you near
Separation of two hearts
I wish that you were here
And now I feel so all alone

Waiting for the day
That we can be together
This lonely road I travel on
Is leading to you
And now I feel so all alone
But I know we'll meet in the end

Whispers of your name gently in the wind
Wishing for my yesterdays
So I could be with you again
And I miss holding near
To be with you I'll find a way

Now is another day
I still walk this lonely road
So many things are left to say
You hear but .you can't answer
And now I feel so all alone
But I know we'll meet in the end
And I miss holding near
To be with you I'll find a way
I'll find a way in the end
