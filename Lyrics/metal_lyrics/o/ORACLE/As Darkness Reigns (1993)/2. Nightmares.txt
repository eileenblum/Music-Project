Fear in the night it's a feeling you get
When you look out the window
Turn on the lights running away
From the creatures you make in your mind
Is it real or does this dreaming
'Cause the crazy things you do
Try to hide and the time will come
When you're left all alone

In the dark
You will remain
Sights unseen
Will take you away
Farther and farther

Crying out, out of control
Losing your mind selling your soul for salvation

You think you're going crazy
Walking the white line
Time will give you answers
Just like your favorite story
There is an ending for you
Time will give you answers
Oh just a dream like a night
In the forest the shadows haunting
Screams in the distance
It was a terrible sound
Determined to drive you insane
Is this real or does this dreaming
'Cause the crazy things you do
Try to hide and the time will come
When you're left all alone

In the dark
You will remain
Sights unseen
Will take you away
Farther and farther

Crying out, out of control
Losing your mind selling your soul for salvation

You think you're going crazy
Walking the white line
Time will give you answers
Just like your favorite story
There is an ending for you
Time will give you answers
Now you awake and the sun shines
Through your bedroom window
You have escaped another night
Of prison in your sleep
Oh just a dream like a night
In the forest the shadows haunting
Screams in the distance it was a terrible sound
Determined to drive you insane

In the dark
You will remain
Sights unseen
Will take you away
Farther and farther

Crying out, out of control
Losing your mind selling your soul for salvation
