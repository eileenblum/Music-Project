I've come a million years
Just to see you fall
And I've seen a million tears
No love at all

I'm coming going
Always knowing
This place is forever mine
Born of only me

And if the sun shines another day
That's how I meant it to be
I'm still trying to find the answer
Why is this place slowly wasting away?

It's time to turn back your hands
And understand it's not supposed to be

I built the land and sea
In essence of your heaven
But you've thrown the world back at me
A heaven this will be never

I'm still trying to find the answer
Why is this place slowly wasting?
Well I'm calling on your sympathies
Or a lonely world you'll know

Coming going I'm always knowing
I'm in waiting forever watching you
It's time to turn back your hands
And understand it's not supposed to be

Because I am your watcher
I've got my eyes on you
I've been here forever
Where's my love going to?

Because I am your watcher
I've got my eyes on you
I've been here forever
Where's my love going to?

Now it's time for me to leave
I'm feeling rather poor
Don't understand and I can't conceive
This Earth you all must abhor

I'm coming going
Always knowing
This place is forever mine
Born of only me

And if the sun shines another day
That's how I meant it to be
I'm still trying to find the answer
Why is this place slowly wasting away?

It's time to turn back your hands
And understand it's not supposed to be

Because I am your watcher
I've got my eyes on you
I've been here forever
Where's my love going to?
