come inside the darkest recess of my mind
feel the wrath, torment and pain
a well-known source of my misery emerges once more

if I could turn back time, I would sell my soul
if I could see her face, forevermore

step inside, cross the threshold of my mind
see my troubles, see my strife
condemned am I to suffer so long
am I better of alone?

another trap has sprung for me, repent and then repeat
it's got to have a meaning, has to be an end

stone by stone, brick by brick
what counts comes from deep within
stone by stone, brick by brick
it all comes down to this

a castle left, built incomplete
what's a kingdom without a queen?

dreams are torn, ravished to pieces
what we had were not meant to be
now I've turned into a nightfall disciple
forced to face the demon in me

my world's just a wasteland of ruins and dust
I have to break away

draw a line, but I cross every border
I have died more than five thousand times
all seems gone, is there a 'morrow?
last resort but, the method's a sin

grab into the darkest recess of my mind
take this mischief and sadness away
put out the source of my misery
please, set me free

so I silently grinned with pleasure
while I colored the path where I strayed
impaled by a love so unfulfilled, I'm heaven denied

stone by stone, brick by brick
what counts comes from deep within
stone by stone, brick by brick
it all comes down to this

slowly approaching toward the flames
no more delusions, hell awaits

do you believe there is more than one meeting?
only death or reincarnation of souls?
truth be shown on the edge of my dagger
here I lie with blood on my hands

a lifeless carcass is all that remains
but I never thought twice

draw a line, but I cross every border
I have died more than five thousand times
life is done, it's finally over
last resort, but the method's a sin

sunlight, I opened my eyes and the shadows drifted aside
while we conduct our fate as we choose,
lift the load, stone by stone
sunlight, I opened my eyes and the shadows drifted aside
while we conduct our fate as we choose,
lift the load, step by step
