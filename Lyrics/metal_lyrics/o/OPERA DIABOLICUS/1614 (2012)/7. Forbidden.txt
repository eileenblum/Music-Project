last night your spirit entered my mind
for once things could not fail
can it be the mirrors turned self-displayed?
so many words that we left unspoken

yet I dare not to fall asleep again
it is then pain becomes alive
every time I close my eyes,
forbidden dreams

have you ever seen water turn into wine?
I drown my endless nights under a sea
have you ever seen what the future will bring?
will I only dream forbidden dreams?

I was torn that day you took farewell
is there a reason and I wonder why?
I know that nothing ever stays the same
for what it's worth my heart holds no regrets

yet I dare not to fall asleep again
it is then pain becomes alive
every time I close my eyes,
forbidden dreams

have you ever seen water turn into wine?
I drown my endless nights under a sea
have you ever seen what the future will bring?
will I only dream forbidden dreams?

I held your hand but you slipped away at the edge of eternity
I will always remember the smile on your face
I saw colours fade away at the edge of eternity
I will always remember you

yet I dare not to fall asleep again
it is then pain becomes alive
every time I close my eyes,
forbidden dreams
