here I lie. feeling my life drift on by
I long for blood again
only darkness surrounding me
left to die, betrayed by my own destiny
I have come to set you free
by the next full moon she will return

wolves howl by the light of the moon
a pale rider forcing his way through
the wood reputed to be haunted
arrives to the village below
as he advanced lightning split overhead
dismounted his steed
and an old man opens the door

barthok, the inn keeper so wise
thirteen guests at this supper tonight
all arguing the countess's demise
stranger, what do you say?
silent you've sat in the corner at bay
emerge from the dark
the black clad stranger rose

he spoke so fierce
take heed to what I say
I've seen her claw, I know
the symbol of insanity

listen close, one and all,
you better believe
and tonight she will come,
she's been revived

witchcraft! that's what you say
how can it be she's returned from the grave?
the stranger replied with a grin
evil spreading its wings
understand,
the end of your lives' close at hand
the tempter knows you can not hide
from the dark

and god repine
seek and you shall find
spawn of hate newborn
summoned by depravity

hear as I sing for you all
this tune of devastation
the sign of the cross has been broken
now my time has come
