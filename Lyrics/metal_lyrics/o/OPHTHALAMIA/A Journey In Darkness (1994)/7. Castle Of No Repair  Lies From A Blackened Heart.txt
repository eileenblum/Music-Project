My castle of blood beyond deepest sorrows lies distant clouds
its grey tower puncture the sky

[whisper] the pain

My skin the gloomy ground will not swallow thee
the echoes of my black heartbeat falls forevermore

[whisper] living further

My heart it cries
it slowly dies
castle of no repair

[whisper] stop the pain
