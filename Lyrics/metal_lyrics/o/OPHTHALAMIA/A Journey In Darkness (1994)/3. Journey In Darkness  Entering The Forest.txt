I'm kneeling down on the forest's deiny ground
sun of the infinite sky doesn't reach me here
Oh darkness embrace me blood stop circulating
the mist surrounds me as I'm falling away my trance
My blackened teeth chew at the air we breathe

[whisper] lean its shapeless nothingness from the holy spirit

Poisoned I am by his holy feeble godness

[whisper] I spit him out in a bloody flood of phlegm

Their world is turned inside out
I take their lips to my mouth
The people lies in articulo mortis
I spread my wings and fly away
I'm the face of the night in which you all will drown
I'm the power the almighty dark everlasting strength
my body was for a moment cold and left alone
still my breath is a sick unken smell

[repeat verses 2 &amp; 3]
