[BATHORY 1984]

[Line-up:]
[IT: guitars]

[Night: bass]
[Legion: vocals]

I summoned up the living dead
And the demons in the skies
I drank from chalise warm and red
And watched the virgined eye

Present at ungodly births
In holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth
And raped the mother of christ

C'mon baby
Raise your knife
Welcome darling
To my sacrifice

Tie the angel to the altar
Sacrifice to lord in hell
Let the warm blood torrent baby
Moonlight set the night on spell

I saw the lightning strike in the sky
And heard your roar in pain
I'd lifted the knife and stroke once more
Your blood was mixed with rain

[Repeat chorus]
