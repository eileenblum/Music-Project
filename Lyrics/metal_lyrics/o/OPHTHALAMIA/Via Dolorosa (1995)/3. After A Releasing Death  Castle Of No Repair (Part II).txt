The old walls shook of thunder seems ages ago
There's only victory in the wardrums triumphant speech

At last

Legion my name is together under mighty conspiracy advance
Sharpen thy sword, the throne of ruins is mine

Over it is

I've strangled the truth and hidden the lie
Towers of wisdom have been beyond and
are possessed by true hate

My breath has left and my face won't reveal
I won't listen nor react, no need to try

After a releasing death

Pain for us

Hey!
