Overwhelming are the trees so great and tall
Everlasting is the rain that from the sky falls
Grey and cold is the gloomy Ophthalamian sky
It's under that majestic sky I'm ready to die

Overwhelming are the mountains so great and tall
Hear the wind's burning desire and its sad call
Black domains are ruled by black minds in the night
Behold Ophthalamian so fearsome in its might
To live and to die under Ophthalamian sky
