I sit in loneliness and watch the meaning of my past.
It dances and twitches then it lays down and dies.
I see the morning sky tremble and then it open and begin to cry
as night falls and darkness fills my room... whispering thoughts haunt me,
my candle burns low.
Can I find my fate ? Can I be one with my desire ?
The perchment of my future burns fast and I burn myself
badly in my futile attempt to save it.
The black blood of my heart weeps, in every tear a part of myself.
I have features of youth but a soul of age.
Why can't I see the web of lies my life is based upon so I can cut them
and become one with the sky ? I long for the harmony... the peace within me.
I wish to see myself in the burning light of truth and no longer be a victim of hate.
I search for the purity in me... I search in my blood...
I open my vein to see what ever it may be.
And as the red rivers of my life flow from its tunnels and caves...
I see lies and falseness die.
I'm fading away, drowing in a thick mist of burning ice.
I'm showered in the blood of dying hate and I feel pure.
I'm taken to the breast of my truth and I'm reborn.
