Flying through the night sky among the stars
the air caresses my naked soul
I've reached Ophthalamia's darkest parts
the evil desolate shore
The icy water whips the ancient rocks
I see the black blooded sea of Ragiih-Nib
the mountains of Makubu-Keen have guided me
oh stars now hear my scream
Give... me... the... Sign... Shores of Kaa-Ta-Nu

[whisper] Give me the Sign

The water raised above me and the sky died
oh lord of all accept my soul... Take me
keep on searching son maybe you'll succeed
so cold everlasting night here I am
Give... me... the... Sign

Try to find the keys of wisdom
Sathanas will guide your quest
and when you'll have found'em
the chosen place is for you
