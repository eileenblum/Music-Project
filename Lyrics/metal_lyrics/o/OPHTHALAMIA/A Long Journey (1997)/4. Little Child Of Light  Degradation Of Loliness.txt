[whisper] Little child of light, so full of life so bright
[whisper] you saved people from sin, and everything they kept within

Love and joy you taught, and had your foolish followers caught
as they were weak and left behind, esaily fooled by your leader kind
you told them to have faith, in a god so good and great
a heaven they would see, if they death would meet with thee
So when hate grew in the air
to fight it you said you dare
with the holy ghost at your side
defeat instead of pride
Shadows from darkness came
unleashing the wrath no one can tame
holy blood were spilled on the ground
and with this all goodness drowned
oh little child of light... you did die that night

But in the first hand they should live
with the intention of goodness give
degradation of their will
you thought evil was so easy to kill

The sky has frozen to ice, and from the ground the dark ones rise
your cross is still in heavens sign, but the inverted one is mine
we'll make known, that the words you spoke, were promises you broke

[repeat verses 3 &amp; 4]
