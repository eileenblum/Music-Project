Ancient cities lost in time
Nations of the grave
Banished to a crypt of freezing pain
Children of the seven seas
Beneath the heavens room
Searching for a place to call a home

I wake up dying
Trapped in this hell
In search of finding
In death we are alone

Does the madman plead insane
Is there death that gives no pain
Blind aggression bring you fame
I just need a chance

To win or lose
We play this dying game
To stand and fight
And breakout from these chains
To maim and kill
I drain you free of life
I live you die
There's blood upon the ice

Distant echoes haunt the brain
The watching waiting men
Laughing for this torture never ends
Captive of the empty dreams
Screaming at the sky
Falling froze am I about to die

I wake up dying
Trapped in this hell
In search of finding
In death we are alone

Does the madman plead insane
Is there death that gives no pain
Blind aggression bring you fame
I just need a chance

To win or lose
We play this dying game
To stand and fight
And breakout from these chains
To maim and kill
I drain you free of life
I live you die
There's blood upon the ice

Death clouds mask the sky
No way was I born to die
Mad sad am I insane
I won't submit to fame
Deaf blind in search of light
C'mon we're gonna fight
Laugh, cry the killing's done
It's time for blood to run

Frozen life to blind to see
A kaleidoscope of time
Awakened by the anger in my mind
Welcome to this dying world
Where sleeping cities lie
The endless lights that fade and pass by

I wake up dying
Trapped in this hell
In search of finding
In death we are alone

Does the madman plead insane
Is there death that gives no pain
Blind aggression bring you fame
I just need a chance

To win or lose
We play this dying game
To stand and fight
And breakout from these chains
To maim and kill
I drain you free of life
I live you die
There's blood upon the ice
