Are these the eyes of a madman
That see a crumbling sky
Reaching out for the answer please tell me why
In a state of reclusion
In a shell-shocked mind
Gazing into the darkness that I can't find

Stay calm
There's panic all around
Listen to the silence it's so loud
Raise hell
Who says that I'm insane
Follow let the blind man lead the way
Madness I'm your slave
Shellshock, shellshock, shellshock
Draining the life from me
Shellshock, shellshock
My ears they bleed
Shellshock, shellshock, shellshock
Twisting my every dream
Shellshock, shellshock
Oh insanity was born in me

In the chill of a nightmare
Awake in screaming pain
Bowing down to emotion every nerve in flame
Am I blind to the reason
Can I really see
Along the path of confusion that's haunting me

Stay calm
There's panic all around
Listen to the silence it's so loud
Raise hell
Who says that I'm insane
Follow let the blind man lead the way
Madness I'm your slave
Shellshock, shellshock, shellshock
Draining the life from me
Shellshock, shellshock
My ears they bleed
Shellshock, shellshock, shellshock
Twisting my every dream
Shellshock, shellshock
Oh insanity was born in me

Watching time for the timeless
Within a conscious dream
A fading scene of violence what can this mean
Through a faith in illusion
Redeem a jaded past
The clawing hands of the clock-face
They turn so fast

Stay calm
There's panic all around
Listen to the silence it's so loud
Raise hell
Who says that I'm insane
Follow let the blind man lead the way
Madness I'm your slave
Shellshock, shellshock, shellshock
Draining the life from me
Shellshock, shellshock
My ears they bleed
Shellshock, shellshock, shellshock
Twisting my every dream
Shellshock, shellshock
Oh insanity was born in me
