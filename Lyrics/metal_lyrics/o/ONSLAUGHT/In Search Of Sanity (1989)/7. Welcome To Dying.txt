As time slips by
I awaken from my sleep
Too blind to see
That tomorrow's just a dream
I fear no pain
As I reach toward the sky
Immortal words
Was I really born to die

My destiny
Please release me from this hell
I'm locked inside
Cannot break the broken spell

Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Now say your last goodbyes

The darkness dies
But the dawn it brings no light
In life or death
Our existence is a fight
In sight of end
Let me die leave me in peace
A slave to life
Break the chains and set me free

My destiny
Please release me from this hell
I'm locked inside, locked inside
Cannot break the broken spell

Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Now say your last goodbyes

Death is spreading like disease
Life I cannot see
Fate a shadow blackening my soul
Life holds nothing for me now
Death so let it be
Fate is something far beyond control

Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Now say your last goodbyes

Before my eyes
Flashing memories of the past
I lie in wait
Could these thoughts now be my last
Time fade away
Have I wasted all these years
As air grows cold
For the end is drawing near

My destiny
Please release me from this hell
I'm locked inside, locked inside
Cannot break the broken spell

Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Now say your last goodbyes
