Death is the way
A passion to die
I see a world gone insane
Obsessed by the fashion to try
Look to the rhyme
The words never change
Forever in line
In search of a new game to play

Follow on
Along the line
Your fate is what you will find
Paralyse
Reality
You bear the scars of devilry

Don't play with fire
Powerplay
Injecting madness in your mind
Powerplay
The flame burns higher
Powerplay
Draw first blood
Life is hello goodbye
Feel the powerplay
Feel the powerplay

Burning inside
Immune to the pain
Caught in a jigsaw of lies
The glamour is fading to shame
Lost in a void
Lost far beyond time
I see in your eyes
A madness that's leading you blind

Follow on
Along the line
Your fate is what you will find
Paralyse
Reality
You bear the scars of devilry

Don't play with fire
Powerplay
Injecting madness in your mind
Powerplay
The flame burns higher
Powerplay
Draw first blood
Life is hello goodbye
Feel the powerplay
Feel the powerplay

Tell me why
The bell of warning rings
If you give me some time
I will prove to you it's lunacy

Running from life
A slow suicide
You hear a voice from the grave
A thorn that lies deep in your side
Leading you down
A spiral to hell
In need of a friend a mistress
That served you so well

Follow on
Along the line
Your fate is what you will find
Paralyse
Reality
You bear the scars of devilry

Don't play with fire
Powerplay
Injecting madness in your mind
Powerplay
The flame burns higher
Powerplay
Draw first blood
Life is hello goodbye
Feel the powerplay
Feel the powerplay
