Classified the holy land
With suffocating peace
A fragile insecurity
Is shattered piece by piece
Chaos in heaven total chaos in hell
Generating the obscene
From the darkness of a terror cell
Bringer of hatred taken in vain
Cos religion is death and religion is pain

Twisted Jesus got a taste for war
Hate preaching missionary
Twisted Jesus gonna kill or cure
Praise your lord
Death awaits

Let us pray

Evil stains the soul within
Cold sadistic discipline
Ruthless killing to begin
Twisted Jesus - minister of sin

Massacre humanity
Impose a new regime
A resurrected king of kings
A psyche of extremes
Preacher of evil instigator of death
Desecrating the remains
The extraction of the final breath
Slaughter of nations saviour of none
Cos religion is lost but religion has won

Twisted Jesus got a taste for war
Hate preaching missionary
Twisted Jesus gonna kill or cure
Praise your lord
Death awaits

Let us pray

Evil stains the soul within
Cold sadistic discipline
Ruthless killing to begin
Twisted Jesus - minister of sin

Fill the rivers with blood retribution for sin
Artificial disease termination on a global scale
Blackened the sun in the nuclear sky
Seven angels of death seven lessons in the way to die

Open the gates of madness
Open the gates of hell
Open the gates of madness
Open the gates of hell

Twisted Jesus got a taste for war
Hate preaching missionary
Twisted Jesus gonna kill or cure
Praise your lord
Death awaits

Let us pray

Evil stains the soul within
Cold sadistic discipline
Ruthless killing to begin
Twisted Jesus - minister of sin
