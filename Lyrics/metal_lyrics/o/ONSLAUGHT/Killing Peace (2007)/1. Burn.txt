Immolation fire from hell
Rejection of the cross
Revelation comes to pass
I plunge you into chaos
Pray at the altar
Pray for a sign
Heaven is crawling
Transgression is mine
Deposition God has failed
I'll Raze you to an empty shell

I just want to set the world on fire
I possess the hatred and the... desire

Burn, burn, burn
Jesus hates me, violates me
Burn, burn, burn
Suffocate in God you trust
Burn, burn, burn
Jesus rapes me, desecrates me
Burn, burn, burn
Ash to ashes, dust to fucking dust

Karmageddon bringing death
The unforgiving flame
Embers of a dying faith
Destroy what you became
Churches are burning
Rentless disdain
Jesus is fuelling
Demonic campaign
Opposition book of lies
I am your darkness unrefined

I just want to set the world on fire
I possess the hatred and the... desire

Burn, burn, burn
Jesus hates me, violates me
Burn, burn, burn
Suffocate in God you trust
Burn, burn, burn
Jesus rapes me, desecrates me
Burn, burn, burn
Ash to ashes, dust to fucking dust

I hate you religiously
I hate you relentlessly
I hate your philosophy
I hate Christianity

In the name of revenge
I unleash upon these flames of
Destruction
For I am your bringer of death
Your child of chaos
He who suffered at your hand without mercy
The tormented soul in a room without light
Your days of judgement have arrived
I'll see you in hell

Burn, burn, burn
Jesus hates me, violates me
Burn, burn, burn
Suffocate in God you trust
Burn, burn, burn
Jesus rapes me, desecrates me
Burn, burn, burn
Ash to ashes, dust to fucking dust
