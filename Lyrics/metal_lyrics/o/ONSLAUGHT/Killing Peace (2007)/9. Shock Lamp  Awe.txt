Destination warfare
The disciplined elite
Strike in silence
Dead of night
Target to delete
A strategy of violence
No mercy no release
No emotion
Killing time
With unrelenting ease

Riding on the winds of death
Raining from the sky
Suffocating final breath
The misery sublime
Shock and awe
Eradicate eliminate exterminate at will shock and awe
Rapid execution termination orchestration of the dead

Cometh of the madman
Cometh of the hour
Cascade through
The corridors of power
Terroristic nightmare
Ostracize the sun
Hell on earth
From nowhere comes
The pain has just begun

Riding on the winds of death
Raining from the sky
Suffocating final breath
The misery sublime
Shock and awe
Eradicate eliminate exterminate at will shock and awe
Rapid execution termination orchestration of the dead

War.. is the kingdom of pain
War.. is the mother of fatality
War.. is a violent domain
War.. chemical nuclear
War.. fare is a circle of hate
War.. is a lesson in brutality
War.. with a smile on the face
War.. is the love inhumanity
War

Shock and awe
Eradicate eliminate exterminate at will shock and awe
Rapid execution termination orchestration of the dead
