I am the face of death
Creator of the thread
Manipulation master class
The lines between unread
I am the broken one
The soul you once betrayed
Disciple of impurity
The epitaph I crave

Our father cast down from heaven
Evil be my name

Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Say a prayer here's a bullet for your head

I am your truth untold
Reality reborn
Intimidator of mankind
Infected to the core
I am your darkest hour
The scarred you left behind
A festering theology
Implanted in my mind

Our father cast down from heaven
Evil be my name

Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Say a prayer here's a bullet for your head

I am the judge and the jury too
I am the execution of your life's demise
You wear the mask of my misery
Imprisoned in the chaos of my twisted mind
Justice for all or insanity
A morbid fascination of the darkest kind
All alone as you bleed as you plead as you scream
I am the prosecution and the sentence is death

Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Save your breath and say a prayer for the dead
Say a prayer here's a bullet for your head

Evil be my name
Evil be my name
Evil be my name
Evil be my name
