My eyes staring at me laughing at me
Needle pushing red
No fear no exception life's rejection
Life can end up dead
Low down silent warning voices calling
Hell is stalking me
I breathe deadly passion living fashion
Damage I can't see

Take this pain away

White heat shooting pleasure made to measure
Tearing through my mind
Hell fire burning faster my disaster
Product of the time
Hard-core cell erosion soul corrosion
Terminal decay
I seek system falling death is waiting
Death do I obey

Take this pain away

Call it violence
Call it trust
Call it pleasure
Call it lust
Pain is horror
Pain is torture
Pain is never enough
Feel the anger
Feel the hate
Feel the madness I create
Pain is human
Pain is power
Gonna fuck you up

I can't stand this pain
This fucking agony
Is driving me insane
Twisting screaming bleeding hating
In my veins manipulating
Crawling craving lifeblood taking
I'm breaking up I'm breaking down

Take this pain away

Call it violence
Call it trust
Call it pleasure
Call it lust
Pain is horror
Pain is torture
Pain is never enough
Feel the anger
Feel the hate
Feel the madness I create
Pain is human
Pain is power
Gonna fuck you up
