Battle follows battle to the death to take the hill
Blackened leather warriors the chill as steel meets steel
One survives by cunning the other lives by might
The death defying warlords by the firelight they fight

[CHORUS:]

With the power of steel they're raiding our land
They're marching from hell with the devil as chief in command

The morning light meets fire still the warriors they kill
They're pushing for the last attack upon the mighty hill
The brave know not of running 'till the last man they will fight
Just raise the steel up to the sky and sound the battle cry

[CHORUS]

Here ends the final battle as the last defender fell
The proud and savage warriors have tread the path from hell
Battle scarred and weary but the sword still strong in hand
Strong in their defiance as they march across the land

[CHORUS]
