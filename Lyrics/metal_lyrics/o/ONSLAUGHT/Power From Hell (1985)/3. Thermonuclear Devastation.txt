It steps out of its vessel and stares in horror
This planet stinks it stinks of death

[CHORUS:]

Thermonuclear devastation of the planet earth

Piles of rubble where cities once stood
Flesh decaying where men once fell

[CHORUS]

A last glance the barren waste
Artificial disease strikes the visitor down
