The sound of horses riding by the riders fists raised to the sky
Burning torches the flames of death the suspects being put to the test

[CHORUS:]

In a different time religion's the same
The witch hunt is on as God's evil reigns

A pretty maid destined to die Lord's servants death in disguise
The evil spirit must be cleansed in the name of God they're claiming revenge

[CHORUS]

The morning skies they turn to night the maiden she's lost her fight
Chilling screams as she burns alive the christians ride home satisfied

[CHORUS]

Many years have now gone by the slayers, the christian pride
The bible remains to cleanse the land but Satan still has the upper hand
