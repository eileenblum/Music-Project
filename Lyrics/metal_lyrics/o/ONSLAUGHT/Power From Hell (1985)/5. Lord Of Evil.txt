One thousand years a captor banished to the pit
Satan calls his armies to rise up from the crypts
They're rising from Tartarus vengeance in their eyes
Power from below the earth from where all evils lie

Satan captor in his realm bound for 1,000 years
Evil, hatred burns inside vengeance fire from the skies

[CHORUS:]

The lord of evil he rides again
The lord of evil 1,000 years he was held a slave

Deep inside the depths of hell along the river Styx
Charon rows his boat of death around the burning pits
The advocate for Satan a worldwide death crusade
Cruel death fighting demons will rule the earth his way

[CHORUS]
