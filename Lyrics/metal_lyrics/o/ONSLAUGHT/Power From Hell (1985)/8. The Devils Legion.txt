Men of war prepare to fight on this the sabbath day
Men of iron men of steel the living they will slay
Rising from the crypts of death they come to kill again
Servants of the master they're the legions of the dead

[CHORUS:]

Legions of Satan the damned bearing life
The warriors immortal they rise to the fight

Savage sons of Satan raise their steel toward the sky
The titan screams with vengeance as he sounds the battle cry
Leading death's disciples in a quest to take this land
Bloodshed &amp; destruction as the living make their stand

[CHORUS]

Bearing the standard of Hades the legions they rise
Reborn by the light of the moon in the blackening skies
Bearing the standard of Hades the legions they rise
A mission of hatred the blood of the mortal the prize
