Cast in fire tempered by the flame evil demons lie within the blade
Mighty swords razor sharpened steel death metal weapons forged to kill

[CHORUS:]

Death metal [4x]

The battlecry headforth men of steel death metal has the power at will
Lightning flashes sound a thunderous roar cold metal ripping flesh down to
the core

[CHORUS]

Death metal satans armies wield seek within the powers of the steel
cast in fire tempered by the flame evil demons lie within the blade

Death...slain by the sons of steel
Metal...cuts the air
