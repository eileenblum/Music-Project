Haunted in mind bear the blackest of hates the darkness has started to rise
Evil as one in the circle within let the orgy of death now begin
Invertedly tied hangs the Jesu so pure demonic love from you all
Rape of the whore in bestial lust a sacrifice to our lord

[Chorus:]

Do what thou wilt sacred law church of hell
Death is the realm swear the oath thou shalt kill

Summon the force incantations of death the virgin is laid on the shrine
Priest of the night wield the scepter of fate rise up the sword to the sky
Evil in mind is the creature possessed an angel of death sent to kill
Strike of the blade that releases the soul the demoniac's work has begun

[Chorus]

Preacher of sin castigating the priest a penance you pay to our lord
Yield to the force as the darkness prevails demons within heed the call
Revel in death fill the chalice with blood drink now the death of the whore
Offer your souls in promiscuous love do what thou wilt is our law

[Chorus]
