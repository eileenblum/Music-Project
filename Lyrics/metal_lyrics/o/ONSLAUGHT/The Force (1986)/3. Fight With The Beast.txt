Bearing the mark of a demon from hell the dragon is cast onto the earth
Seeking revenge on the woman of man Satanus unleashes his wrath
Angels of death are the allies of hate the jackals destroying the cross

[Chorus:]

Fighting with fire the dragon attacks
Burning the cross and unleashing the powers of hell
Cursed are the mortals who dare to fight with the beast

Demons of hell bear the mark of the beast the sons of the dragon are born
Summoned to earth armageddon is here to slaughter the christian hordes
Destroying the temples Jehova has lost the nazarene will fester in hell

[Chorus]

A wrathful attack upon the christian faith the legions of Satan make war
Replacing the cross with the mark of the beast the kingdoms of Jesu have fell
Demons of hell armageddon is here preventing the coming of christ
relinquish your god now that satan is king the nazarene will never arise

Bearing the mark of a demon from hell the dragon is cast onto earth
Seeking revenge on the woman of man Satanus unleashes his wrath
Angels of death are the allies of hate the jackals destroying the cross

[Chorus]
