The fires are burning deep down in hell the warlords are ready to rise
Forces of evil angels of sin bloodlust and hate in their eyes
Nations lie wait in the fear of their death standing one foot in the grave
Satan pronounces let death be to all that none of the living are saved

[Chorus:]

Hellbound the horsemen ride let there be death to all
Ride through the burning skies see that no one survives
Send their souls to hell - Let there be death

Nuclear warfare raging on earth destruction the ultimate key
Life termination the only reward no living beyond his decree
Bodies turn vapour a ghost of the past the souls are delivered to hell
Satan pronounces let death be to all the warlords are under his spell

[Chorus]

Blinding light the fireball illuminates the sky
Death force captive of the cloud that lurks above
Searing heat the fires coalesce into a storm
No retreat Satan holds the power of the gods

Satan stands watching alone in his ground he laughs with a deafening cry
Evil and hatred vengeance and death the fires are burning the sky
Earth is now wasteland infernal hell nothing but darkness remains
Satans awaiting to regain the crown return it to hell's dark domain

[Chorus]
