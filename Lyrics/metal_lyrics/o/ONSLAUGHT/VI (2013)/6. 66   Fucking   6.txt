Hell is here its the new asylum
Phase 1 - ride the demon wave
This is war with extreme aggression
Horns high in a sea of rage
Battle scarred from the frontline bloodshed
Phase 2 Charge the pit and down
Bang bang bang a thousand hammer heads
Thrasing out on the hallowed ground

[Chorus]
Louder harder faster than a mark 8 shell
Darker stronger heavier than the gates of hell

We are the chaos legions
We fight with an iron fist
We play the devils music
We are the union of the 6 6 6
66'fucking'6

Hit the floor in a pain reaction
Phase 3 A crushing wall of death
Broken limbs and a screaming siren
Body Count strike a chord for the dead
Killing light in our world of darkness
Phase 4 Its a violent dawn
Sold my soul in search of madness
Legacy of the circle born

[Chorus]

They fear you they fear me
They fear their world of misery
They fear you they fear me
They fear the sound of devilry
The sound of world war 3
They fear me

[Chorus]

We are we are
We are the devils legions
We are we are
We are the devils legions
66'fucking'6
