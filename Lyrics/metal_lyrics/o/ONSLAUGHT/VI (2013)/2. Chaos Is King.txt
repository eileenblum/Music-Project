Rising Antichrist
Revolution treatys end
Darkest malefice
Unrelenting storm descends

Flames of unity
Firing of hate
Burnt impurity
Ashes of faith

Skeleton paradise
Borders do extend
Welcome to my realm of chaos, chaos, chaos
In death or glory
Chaos is my king

Toxic chemistry
Independence never tamed
Twisted zealotry
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained

Flag of liberty
Symbol of law
Blood red legacy driven by lore

Dissident symphony
Marching on to war
Welcome to my realm of chaos, chaos, chaos
In death or glory
Chaos is my king

Resolution
Hell on earth
Universal slaves
Nations of a new rebirth
Phoenix from an open grave

Propaganda masterminds
Fragmenting the truth
Speakers sending out the signs
Engaging with the disaffected youth

Only the strong will survive
There is no rewind
Your freedom of speech now denied

Welcome to my world of chaos [3x]
Chaos
My world of chaos
In death or glory
Death or glory
Chaos, chaos, chaos
In death or glory
Chaos is my king
