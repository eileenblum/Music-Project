The gates of hell have opened wide with deadly speed the metal it strikes
A fork of light rains from the sky To feed the amps with power supply
Killerwatts to be unleashed we'll show no mercy bring you to your knees
Hit the switch the power's free it'll blow your ears &amp; make you mutha's
scream
[CHORUS:]
Onslaught...Power from hell
Power, power, power, power from hell
With the wrath of Satan in our minds we take the stage to play for our lives
When the power racks hit overdrive the banging heads they look toward the sky
Thrashing metal savage screams yeah this is hell it's not just a dream
Hammers pound at breakneck speed to crush the souls of those who disbelieve
[CHORUS]
