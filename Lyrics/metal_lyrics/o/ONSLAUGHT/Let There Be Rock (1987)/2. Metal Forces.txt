Battles burn the wrath of hell the force cannot be slain
Men and steel we stand as one to fight on through the pain
Soldiers die the blood runs red we bear the blackest hates
Metal force now crack the sky and raise the seven gates
[Chorus:]
Running wild shellshock cracks the beams
Sweat and leather thrashing metal screams
Battle cries the power racks they roar
Blood and death upon the stage of war
The metal forces
Haunting mist engulfs the stage we make the final stand
Satan's troops attack as one and hold the death command
Fighting hard with axe and chain the flame it burns the night
Metal storm the heavens fall we ride on seas of light
[Chorus]
Metal storm a fork of light raining from the skies
Evil strikes across the land the metal forces rise
Darkness cast on blinded eyes this war cannot be won
Sweat and blood hail from above as the battle rages on
High on stage the end draws near we fight on through the pain
Metal forces stand as one this power runs through veins
[Chorus]
