Terminal perfection
Culture of the core elite
System of selection
Taken from your world of peace
A morbid fascination
Intravenous cobalt eyes
By chemical persuasion
An agonizing slow demise

Seasoned to the screams of pain
Extermination with disdain
With consummate brutality
Do sever all reality

Master of the perfect death
Sadistically insane
An angel at the gates to hell
Embraced to kill again
A homicidal legacy
A passion for obscene
Messiah to the living dead
Creator of a dream

Rest in pieces
Nothing of your life remains
Rest in pieces
Sanitized infected fucking stained

Merciless dissection
Amputation limb from limb
Human vivisection
Shedding of the bloodied skin
Raping mother nature
Jackal tearing at his prey
Face off to the maker
Surgeon without resume

Concepts in a twisted game
Annihilation inhumane
Violence in extremity
Do sever all reality

Master of the perfect death
Sadistically insane
An angel at the gates to hell
Embraced to kill again
A homicidal legacy
A passion for obscene
Messiah to the living dead
Creator of a dream

Rest in pieces
Stripped of flesh you lay in parts
Rest in pieces
Mutilated corpse wide open heart

No one hears you cry in vain
No one sees your dying shame
No one ever feels your pain
No one even knows your fucking name

No fucking name

Seasoned to the screams of pain
Extermination with disdain
With consummate brutality
Do sever all reality

Master of the perfect death
Sadistically insane
An angel at the gates to hell
Embraced to kill again
A homicidal legacy
A passion for obscene
Messiah to the living dead
Creator of a dream

Rest in pieces
Cast into a funeral pyre
Rest in pieces
Ashes to the wind reborn in fire
