Anti-Christ or an angel in time
It's another fucking holy day
Say a prayer a celebration of life
A slave to the bible and a slave to the mind
Church of the trinity church in dust
Bound by affinity cast in rust
Blessed is the anger within my soul
Bow to your master I will not be controlled

Freedom of speech
Is my freedom of thinking
You made me pray to a god
That I would never believe in

I'm scarred
Deep are the wounds that you gave me
The scars that can never be healed
I'm scarred
This is the way that you saved me
The way that you raised me
The way you made me scarred

Life or death
Is the cross that you wear
Of the faith that you follow blind
Sanitized
By the spirit of fire
In the name of the father
In an age of denial
Lamb of impurity lamb is slain
Black is the sheep
I will not be shamed
Hate with a passion
Through primal years
Thine is the kingdom
But mine is a life without fear

Freedom of speech
Is my freedom of thinking
You made me pray to a god
That I would never believe in

I'm scarred
Deep are the wounds that you gave me
The scars that can never be healed
I'm scarred
This the way that you saved me
The way that you raised me
The way you made me scarred

Reject your world of wonder
In search of something real
Reject the pain I suffer
My life was never yours to steal

Fuck religion and fuck your god
Fuck religion and fuck your god
Fuck the bible and fuck your cross

I'm scarred
Deep are the wounds that you gave me
The scars that can never be healed
I'm scarred
This the way that you saved me
The way that you raised me
The way you made me scarred
Deep are the wounds that you gave me
The scars that can never be healed
I'm scarred
This the way that you saved me
The way that you raised me
The way you made me scarred
