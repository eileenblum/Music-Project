Welcome to your death
Take the first breath
Suffocate in hell
Soldier born to be
Taken liberty
Broken empty shell
Fast track psychopath
Burning fast
Rabid dog of war
Seven years of pain
Never to reclaim
Child nevermore

Life or death or death of life
Death immortal mortal life
Live for dying dying pure
Death is waiting

Born for war
Raining hate the blood runs red
Burning hatred only friend
Born for war
Embryonic death machine
Born for war

Bullets for the weak
Violent hide and seek
Searching to destroy
Devil in disguise
Angel in the eyes
Mothers hunter boy
Maim kill swallow pill
Blood to spill
Master to the gun
In fanatic hate
Dominating fate
Blackening the sun

Life or death or death of life
Death immortal mortal life
Live for dying dying pure
Death is waiting

Born for war
Raining hate the blood runs red
Burning hatred only friend
Born for war
Homicidal death machine
Born for war

The brutalization of civilization
Expanding the threshold of power
Extreme violation and life termination
A study of violence
Obsession is theirs to devour

Death and destruction alluring seduction
Intrinsic the cleansing of souls
A twisted mutation this new generation
Your weapon your warfare
Possession of minds to control

Waiting for the day
For the new prey
Time for do and die
Order by command
To the promised land
Coerced suicide
Code red walking dead
Story's end
Taking final breath
Freedom hating slave
Cradle to the grave
Puppet laid to rest

Life or death or death of life
Death immortal mortal life
Live for dying dying pure
Death is waiting

Born for war
Raining hate the blood runs red
Burning hatred only friend
Born for war
Suicidal death machine
Born for war

Embryonic death machine
Homocidal death machine
Suicidal death machine
Born for war
