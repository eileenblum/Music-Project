Suicide liberation
Edge of the abyss
Overdose intoxication
Self destruction precipice

Voices screaming in your head
Motherfucker make me dead

Classified exsanguination
Paint your world in violent shades of red

Hell is like a razor through the vein
Slow death blood begins to drain
Perpetrator of your self demise
You're gonna die

I wanna hear the silence
I wanna feel your pain
I wanna see the violence
Draw the life blood
From your broken veins
I am the face of horror
I am the life you leave
I am the source of sorrow
It takes your death
To kill my misery
Suicideology

Cyanide expiration
Never ending peace
Comatose asphyxiation
Ultra deep eternal sleep

Choking in a pool of sin
Hollow void beneath the skin

Glorified extermination
Immolation burning from within

Fire gonna blow it all away
Gun shot bullet to the brain
Serenity in violence so divine
You're gonna die

I wanna hear the silence
I wanna feel your pain
I wanna see the violence
Draw the life blood
From your broken veins
I am the face of horror
I am the life you leave
I am the source of sorrow
It takes your death
To kill my misery
Suicideology 

I am your god forsaken
I am your what could be
I am the unmistaken
Final breath you take in self pity
You are the life destroyer
You are the demon seed
You are the paranoia
Turning off the lights before you leave

Suicideology

I wanna hear the silence
I wanna feel your pain
I wanna see the violence
Draw the life blood
From your broken veins
I am the face of horror
I am the life you leave
I am the source of sorrow
It takes your death
To kill my misery
Suicideology
