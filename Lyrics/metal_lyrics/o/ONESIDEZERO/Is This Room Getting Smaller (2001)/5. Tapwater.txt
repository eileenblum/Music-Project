throw your life away
and everything will come to you
if you still believe
in all the things you've tried to do
when something's facing your life well
I just can't give in
I've never seen it I can't win
oh lover
you were wrong
submission
when something changes you won't know
I've always crossed it out
when everything's such a lie well
oh lover
you were wrong
submission
throw your life away
and everything will come to you
if you still believe in
all the things you've tried to do
throw your life away
it will come back in the end
if you still believe
but you wish not to pretend
when something's facing your life well
I just won't give in
I've never seen it I can't win
oh lover
you were wrong
submissionthrow your life away
and everything will come to you
if you still believe
in all the things you've tried to do
throw your life away
it will come back in the end
if you still believe
but you wish not to pretend
throw your life away
and everything will come to you
if you still believe
in all the things you've tried to do
throw your life away
it will come back in the end
if you still believe
but you wish not to pretend
won't fall
won't fall for it
wanted me to admit
telling me I should submit
won't fall
won't fall for it
wanted me to submit
I never will submit to this
liar
submission
throw your life away
and everything will come to you
if you still believe
in all the things you've tried to do
throw your life away
it will come back in the end
if you still believe
but you wish not to pretend
I will one day come to you
