it feels like a lonely day
it seems like a throw away
and everything is a sad reminder
of the way we could be together
it feels like a lonely day
never ending
a never ending day
a never ending day
there will be a next time
in my heart in my mind
I see me beneath you
before the truth can seep through
this is so contagious
and everyday it changesthere will be a next time
shape turns a false display
hoped for a holiday
a sequel to the memory of her
and the day we laid together
it feels like a lonely day
never ending
a never ending
a never ending
there will be a next time
in my heard in my mind
I see me beneath you
before the truth can seep through
this is so contagious
and everyday it changes
there will be a next time
