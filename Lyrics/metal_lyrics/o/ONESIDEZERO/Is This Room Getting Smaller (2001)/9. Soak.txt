like the sea you are water
pushing for change
all that I can see is a pool of rain
wish I thought of this much sooner
it felt so right
all the secrets soak
can put out the flame
after all you were right
so beautiful
held the wrongs from the rights
so beautiful
open mind
show me your details and more
believe only what you see so wrong
after all you were right
so beautiful
held the wrongs from the rights
so beautiful
