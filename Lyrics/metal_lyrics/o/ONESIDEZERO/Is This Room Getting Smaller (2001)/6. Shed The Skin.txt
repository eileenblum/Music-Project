swallow your eyes
circle the tired
survive
sharing the light we have lost
you might believe
that it was so lost
forcing us down intoanother belief to carry us home
forcing us down into
you wrote the words
that we said so wrong
swallow your rights
sample the sweetness of your life
show me what it means to be free
you might believe
that it was so wrong
forcing us down into
another belief to carry us home
forcing us down into
but you wrote the words
that we said so wrong
I feel like I shed my skin
we've done it this time
we've lost all self control
follow us this time
I wish I could
imprisoned this time
when will the truth be told
follow us this time
I wish I could
you might believe
that it was so wrong
forcing us down into
another belief to carry us home
forcing us down into
but you wrote the words
that we said so wrong
forcing us down into
another disease that's killing us off
so wrong
we're so wrong
I feel like I shed my skin
