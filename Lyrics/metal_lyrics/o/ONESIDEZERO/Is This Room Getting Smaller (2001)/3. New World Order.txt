I have seen it this time
but I am older now
all that you could ever
but you will not
you will not come down
offer me solutions
but I am sober now
all that you could ever
but you will not
you will not come down
offer me new propositions
here's something that you can rely
well you will take position
you will not
you will not survive
cause everything is different now
though it seems so impossible to knowever think to ask me how or why
well offer me new institutions
some place I can clear up my mind
open up and swallow this mother fucker
you will not
you will not survive
I have seen the difference
but I am older now
well you will take what you want from me
but you will never win
cause everything is different now
though it seems so impossible to know
ever think to ask me how or why
I have seen it now
I never will come down
wish I could hold the photograph
yet this scene is old
I never felt this cold
wish I could hold from me...
now
cause everything is different now
though it seems so impossible
ever think to ask me how or why
offer me new institutions
here's something that you can rely
well you will take position
you will not
you will not survive
