say you want to breathe comfort
eyes wide open
I've forgotten you come alive
you celebrate your arms wide open
hands are broken
silent for tonight
say heaven should know
if you
say heaven should knowholding all that you have chosen
I have spoken for what's right
circling all your hands are broken
I'll surrender for one night
say heaven should know
if you
say heaven should know 
silent so long
wish I could come home
feel like the world
has been pushing me
oh lord what you feel deep inside
I'll hold your breath
until you cry
silent so long
wish I could let go
my arms have held
too long to know
inside so weak
hold on one more day
believed you would reach down and...
say heave should know
if you
say heaven should know
no
