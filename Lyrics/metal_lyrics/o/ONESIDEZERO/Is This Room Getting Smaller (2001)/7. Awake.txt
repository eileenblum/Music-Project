so sorry whisper all night
I lay here deep in silent plight
my head consumes the light
too much thought my life's evolving
I wish that I could buy
another world that's all grown up
inherit sleepless criesI'd rather kill the torment
kill the torment
say it's alright
can't I won't
hold I'm always awake
should this time
you forgive
leave surrender awake
you've seen the worst of my dreams
I can't escape this endless breach
holding on so tight
writing lover's stories hopeless
so place on my eyes
the sounds of my life
can't wait see my hands above her
see my hands above her
say it's alright
can't I won't
hold I'm always awake
should this time
you forgive
leave surrender awake
