your temptations are ugly
moving forward by stumbling
breathing in all that we see
holding all that we could be
hold your breath
I feel so alive
save yourself
I feel so alive
hold your breath
I feel so alive
save yourself
I feel so alive
all dressed up on a Sunday
the funeral mourners await the rainholding on to what we prayed for
although you said you could not breathe at all
hold your breath
I feel so alive
save yourself
I feel so alive
hold your breath
I feel so alive
save yourself
I feel so alive
your temptations are ugly
moving forward by stumbling
in our own...
