see mother will hold the children
from all the world's pain
father still looks deep with eyes of hate
folding our arms
when the happiness falls apart from
all was unknown until you create the game
so it's time
clear our minds
underground
shut your eyes
follow the gun
quench the thirst for love
that you have kept from
only son that has held you up so high
feel like the road has been pushed away
and back again when mother will you
protect all of us somehow
so it's time
clear our minds
underground
shut your eyes
