secrets out unfold
whisper words be warned
falling into one
it's you I still believe
felt so alive
wish I could hold
it's already fullso phase me out of your life
it's all
it's all ready full
treat the son our own
haven't seen him grow
held the hand we lost
it's you I can't recall
felt so alive wish I could hold
it's already full
so phase me out of you life
it's all
it's all ready full
secrets out unfold
whisper words be warned
falling into one
it's you I still believe
you still believe
all that we couldn't see
and it seemed so wrong
but I wish I could never will
it's already full
it's already full
it's all
it's all
it's all ready... full
it's all ready full
it's all can't force from me
it's all full
