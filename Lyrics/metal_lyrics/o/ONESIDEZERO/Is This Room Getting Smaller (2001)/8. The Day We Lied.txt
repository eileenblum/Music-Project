I'll tuck you in
make sure the noose is tight
moving from side to side
inhibits your will to fight
I'll hold you always
clipping your wings away
laughing at your dismay
until your end is crowned
hold you always
beauty in your eyes
escape to your world please
ambush your thoughts this way
believe in this love affair
collecting your silent pleas
comfort all your fears
but I'll hold you always
clipping your wings away
tying you up this way
until your end is crowned
hold you alwaysbeauty in your eyes
escape to your world please
I'll hold you always
beauty in your eyes
escape to your world please
tying you up this way
clipping your wings away
I'm holding you always
I'm clipping your wings away
don't you wish you could fly
I'll come close, the end is near
hold you always
beauty in your eyes
escape to your world please
