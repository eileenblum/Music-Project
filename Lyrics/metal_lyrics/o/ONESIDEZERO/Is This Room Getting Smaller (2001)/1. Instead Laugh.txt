it's suicide but something's missing
I'm bound
in flesh it cut once
but all his life
he was waiting 
control faith left envy
but all her life she was searching
so real followed her own
suicide it never showed me
all that was true for me
I'm not like you
but open your eyes
I drank from you mind
it tastes so divine
all that we knew
it seemed so untrue
I faced your life
come give me a try
soon you'll know what its all worth
so real followed her own
suicide it's me you swallow
all that was true for me
I'm not like you
but open your eyes
but open your eyes
I drank from your mind
it tastes so divine
all that we knew it seemed so untrue
I faced your life come give me a try
but all her life she was searching
so real followed her own
suicide something's missing
