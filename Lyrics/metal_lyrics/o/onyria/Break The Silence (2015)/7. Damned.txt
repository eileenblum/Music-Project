Roses without petals
Moving in time
Of slow symphonies
Sung by the night

It seems that I have slept for centuries
In dark and cold places
In the darkness of the soul my blood is pulsing slow
Is a pleasuring suicide that's not scaring me
The agony of your taste that slowly consumes me

It's just like hell
Where a moment lasts forever
I wanna slowly die and ever would I give away this sweet pain
I'm damned for you

Oh goddess of the night, queen of my dreams
Take me away and erase my mistakes
I'm burning in my timeless memories
Through the flames of these dark
Winter melodies
This is where I shall lie forever
Maybe one day I'll wake up and then I
I will dance with the moonlight

It's just like hell
Where a moment lasts forever
I wanna slowly die and ever would I give away this sweet pain
I'm damned for you

Now that you are here with me
The fire that's in my soul
It warms my blood
Please let me burn
I'm a sinner now
But I can't forget this love

It's just like hell
Where a moment lasts forever
I wanna slowly die and ever would I give away this sweet pain

It's just like hell
Where a moment lasts forever
I wanna slowly die and ever would I give away this sweet pain
I'm damned for you
