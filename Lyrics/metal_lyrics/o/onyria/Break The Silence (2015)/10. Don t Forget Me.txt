Touch my hands, can you feel it they are so cold?
Forceless my weak heart, is still beating, can you believe it?
My face, you don't have to watch it
Sometimes doesn't matter what your eyes see
The most beautiful things, are not seen

Never let your sorrow
Cancel your desire
To move forward

Just promise me
You won't forget me
Don't erase your memories
For fear of suffering, and you will see I will live
Inside you
Forever
Until one day
We will be together

Maybe these will be my last moments
But believe me,
The worst thing is the agony
But when you're next to me
The biggest agony is to be not able to tell you
That everything will be fine
So please, please don't cry
I was left with so little time
And I will take away
The memories of your smile for eternity
And don't despair because until my last breath you
Will give me all the strength to ignore all my pain
And to fight, to stay alive
To stay alive
To stay alive

Just promise me
You won't forget me
Don't erase your memories
For fear of suffering, and you will see I will live
Inside you
Forever
Until one day
We will be together

Tell me the most beautiful things
To keep away my fears
With your eyes
You will light up my darkest nights

Just promise me
You won't forget me
Don't erase your memories
For fear of suffering, and you will see I will live
Inside you
Forever
Until one day
We will be together

Promise me
You won't forget me
Promise me
Promise me
