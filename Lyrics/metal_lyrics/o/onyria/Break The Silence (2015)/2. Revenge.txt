I will fight until the silence disappears
My voice you will fear
And all the rage in my heart
At that point will explode
Maybe nothing will change
And the worst still remains

But I run against the wind
Asking for my dreams, hoping that your nights are sleepless
Your days are meaningless, your life like a real nightmare

You taught me another way to hurt
But without violence disillusion burns more
And you know what I mean, that your business
Is to sell a dream and fake realities
Stripping out the dignity
I don't care about your will
Maybe nothing will change
And the worst still remains

But I run against the wind
Asking for my dreams, hoping that your nights are sleepless
Your days are meaningless, your life like a real nightmare

So, I don't think I'm too mean
If I take pleasure in your grief
Because the only thing I need
Is to feel myself redeemed
Once for all

And I run against the wind
Asking for my dreams, hoping that your nights are sleepless
Your days are meaningless your life like a real nightmare

And I run against the wind
Asking for my dreams hoping that your nights are sleepless
Your days are meaningless your life like a real nightmare
