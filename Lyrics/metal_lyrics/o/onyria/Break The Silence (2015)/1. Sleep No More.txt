I thought it wasn't strange 
To feel your loss still, everyday 
Blaming memories for my pain 
It was your fault, of your mistakes 
But after all my torture goes on, 
It's so deep, it's obscure 

Let me live, abandon me 
You're just pure damnation, a sweet temptation 
That scares me out and I can't control, 
It tears my soul apart 
And I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I sleep no more 

You're just a bad side of myself 
Buried down and put to rest 
You're the sin that I have done 
The sickest part of my past 
I tried to take away your breath 
But you're still there now 
And I can't sleep no more 

Leave me free, abandon me 
You're just pure damnation, a sweet temptation 
That scares me out and I can't control, 
It tears my soul apart 
And I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I sleep no more 

You're a ghost that haunts my mind 
Don't bother me again 
You're a tragic part of my life 
Release from this pain 
Forget me, erase me 
I'm just searching for my own freedom 
That with you 
I'll never have 

Let me live, abandon me 
You're just pure damnation, a sweet temptation 
That scares me out and I can't control, 
It tears my soul apart 
And I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I sleep no more
