I believed in the most shameless appearance
I relied on the filthiest kindness
I was blinded
And now I understand that I've always tried to see the positive
Where it just never existed

All these greetings, joyful feelings
Friends so promising
Hugs and kisses, dates and wishes
All seemed perfect as a dream, and now I get to see
That the end is here

It's so fake, it's so false
Because everything revolves
Around the usual monotony
Double faces, follow the masses
All together in harmony, hypocrisy
It's their disease

Watchful eyes
Creepy liars
Always ready to misjudge you
As something you've never been
You can trust them, and just regret then
It's so crazy as it's seems
Just envy, just let me breathe

It's so fake, it's so false
Because everything revolves
Around the usual monotony
Double faces, follow the masses
All together in harmony, hypocrisy
It's their disease

What used to kill me now gives me strength
And now I'm stronger
I won't get hurt , not anymore
And I will not take it, no more
I'm stronger

It's so fake, it's so false
'cause everything revolves
Around the usual monotony
Double faces, follow the masses
All together in harmony, hypocrisy
It's your disease

I believed in the most shameless appearance
I relied on the filthiest kindness
I was blinded
And now I understand that I've always tried to see the positive
Where it just never existed, never existed, never existed, never existed...
