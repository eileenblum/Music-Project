Look at me
Listen to me
I'm right here
And I live in you
In the most hidden part of you
That you'll never understand

You keep to lock in yourself
For the fear of falling down
In the depth
Of your heart
Where you couldn't never leave
And you're weak and you're frail
And you're looking for the strength
To go on
To go on
You're a prisoner
You're a prisoner

I'm the nightmare of your nights
I'm the evil of your mind
And in your screams
I'm despair

You're the prisoner
Of your own mind
Your eyes can't see no more
Your heart doesn't feel anything

You keep to lock in yourself
For the fear of falling down
In the depth
Of your heart
Where you couldn't never leave
And you're weak and you're frail
And you have to go on

I can't stand to live
In this nightmare anymore
I won't leave you here alone
I'm the prisoner
