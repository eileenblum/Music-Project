My life was always tormentated
Until fate brought me to meet you
You had to face my damn nature
Now I'm depending just on you
You knew the wrong I had inside me
The sickest thought I kept in me
All the fears that burned me down
And kept me crawling on the ground

You're my Valium you can calm me
You can kill me if you're missing
You're so attractive an addiction,
I'm your slave you're my perfection
It seemed that life was just all here
I felt the end was really near
And now I'm sure I'm not more
I'm not the wrong one

You gave me hope to break the silence
To let my feelings speak out loud
Lost in useless situations
Where the good was not allowed
I was surrounded by the strangers
The most worthless living ones
They should have never deserved
To see my tears to drain my hope

Now I can give a meaning to my silence
No more a slave for my deepest madness
In your sky I'm the only star
The one that burns stronger than your sun
You make me shine you make me feel alive
And please oh please don't let me die

You're my Valium you can calm me
You can kill me if you're missing
You're so attractive an addiction,
I'm your slave you're my perfection
It seemed that life was just all here
I felt the end was really near
And now I'm sure I'm not more
I'm not the wrong one
