I'm drifting away and I lost my breath
I need to be saved from the agony of losing myself again
Where I live I have no name
To the sea where I belong you will find my home
As my time fades away

I can't live without my sea, is the only thing I need
Between the waves my thoughts are safe
the ocean will drip my tears away
And I find my name

I'm a fragile warrior, and I'm singing for you
So I will reach you with my voice
The beating of my heart follows the sound of broken souls
Because my life is hanging by a thread
Without you I'm dead
Save me from the end

I'm the beautiest dream of your mind
The restless child of a world you can deny
In my veins flows the breeze, but in my heart there's melancholy
Let the wind take my spirit away from this place
'Cause my time fades away

I'm a fragile warrior, and I'm singing for you
So I will reach you with my voice
The beating of my heart follows the sound of broken souls
Because my life is hanging by a thread
Without you I'm dead
Save me from the end
