Give me wings, so I can reach you
Make me free I wanna fly next to you
Imperceptible, invisible like you

My darling, you can't see me anymore
And if you only know
How cold and stale is here
My skin is so pale,
My breath won't last
But let me go, it's so hard

I still feel the smell of your white skin
Your presence is here, but your voice is just a memory
I know this terrible pain will haunt my soul forever
Our love will be eternal together

Nightmares are hunting me
Please save me
With your song, and take my soul

From the grave, through the stone
This love can live, survive to all
And I know, you live in me
Deep within where you can stay forever more

Everybody tells me that I have to give up on you
That my life goes on, and I have to be strong
But they don't know that this love is eternal
'Cause when the night falls I feel you and I see you

Once more I'm crying, once more I'm dying
Can you hear what I scream inside?

Take me away, don't leave me alone
I don't wanna live on my own

Keep our memories alive,
I'll always be by your side

I wanna die, to be with you again

Nightmares are hunting me
Please save me
With your song, and take my soul

From the grave, through the stone
This love can live, survive to all
And I know, you live in me
Deep within where you can stay
Forever more
Forever more
My heart belongs to you

From the grave, through the stone
This love can live, survive to all
And I know, you live in me
Deep within where you can stay
Forever more

From the grave, through the stone
This love can live, survive to all
And I know, you live in me
Deep within where you can stay
Forever more
Forever more
My heart belongs to you

...through the stone
This love can live, survive to all
And I know, you live in me
Deep within where you can stay
Forever more
