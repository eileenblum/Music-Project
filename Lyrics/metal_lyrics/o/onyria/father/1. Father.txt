Daddy can you hear?
The sound of the lies you told me
Dancing around the wind
Whispering you a story
The little child you brought in this world
Tried to hang himself with a rope
Opened his mailbox twice in a day
To find nothing, you did always forget
Birthdays, Christmas, waiting for a call
You showed no mercy for the life of your son
He wished to see you since so many years
Doesn't matter now, it's way too late

Daddy can you hear this song
The sound of the end
Of the days for your soul
There is no
Hell for your crimes
Just a thousand years alone
With your mind

Grew up with mom, she worked all night long
To provide for his son food a shelter and much love
Crying every night where the hell is him?
Mommy got sick, told me I wish I was dead
There is hope for you? I'm not sure
You will pay for this life I swear it to God
You better find someone you can trust
Cause I won't bury you dad
You deserve it not

Daddy can you hear this song
The sound of the end
Of the days for your soul
There is no hell for your crimes
Just a thousand years alone
With your mind

Daddy can you hear?
The sound of the lies you told me
Dancing around the wind
Whispering you a story

Daddy can you hear this song
The sound of the end
Of the days for your soul
There is no hell for your crimes
Just a thousand years alone
With your mind

Daddy can you hear this song
The sound of the end
Of the days for your soul
There is no hell for your crimes
Just a thousand years alone
With your mind
With your mind, with your mind
With your mind, with your mind
