You've grown up so fast
And you never had a chance
To prove you're not a mistake
Let this pain come to an end
And you never understood
What was wrong with you
Carrying, trying, fighting for your own place
Waiting for someone you could embrace

You were alone
Fighting the world
Now your reality
Is not that of your dreams
You were alone
Fighting for more
Until your last breath
You will tell your story

You were always put aside
Always betrayed, every time
Searching for pieces of your whole
You need to find your roots, your home
Broken, shattered, left on the ground
Endless tears that made no sound
Making their way right from your heart
As your world has fell apart

You were alone
Fighting the world
Now your reality
Is not that of your dreams
You were alone
Fighting for more
Until your last breath
You will tell your story
And you will, remember that

"I won't be alone."
This is how your story began,
Repeat to yourself,
From the start 'til the end
"I won't be alone no more, no more."

Broken, shattered, left on the ground
Endless tears that made no sound
Making their way from your heart
As your world has fell apart

You were alone
Fighting the world
Now your reality
Is not that of your dreams
You were alone
Fighting for more
Until your last breath
You will tell your story
