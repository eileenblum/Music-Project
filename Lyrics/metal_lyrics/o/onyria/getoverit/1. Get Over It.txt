Is still there something in this life
For what is worth to fight
The void hurts more than the fall
Feeling powerless harms the soul
Like the frost on a flower
Like beatings while you're crying
Crying
It doesn't matter how much anger guides your way
If you no longer have a destination
If in your head you got a war
You're almost living without directions
Without directions

What does it mean to be fearless
What does it mean to have no worries
And don't try to understand me
What surrounds me could swallow me
The lesson is try to be not a part
Of your destruction
And get over it, get over it
Get over it

I got so many more enemies
Than friends and desire to live in mediocrity
Sometimes I don't see any silver lining
Sometimes I feel hopeless
I can't to go ahead
I'm living a toxic existence

What does it mean to be fearless
What does it mean to have no worries
And don't try to understand me
What surrounds me could swallow me
The lesson is try to be not a part
Of your destruction
And get over it, get over it
Get over it, get over it
Get over it

Get over, get over
Get over it

What does it mean to be fearless
What does it mean to have no worries
And don't try to understand me
What surrounds me could swallow me
The lesson is try to be not a part
Of your destruction
And get over it
And get over it
Get over it
