There is no cure for my disease
There is no cure
Can you understand me? Oh no you can't
Everything around me is wrong and negative
Everything inside my head seems to be out of place
I just want to be someone else

I wanna be happy
I wanna be free
I wanna dream, I just want to live my life
Like the other people do, but in agony this time

Sometimes I cry and I even don't know why
I don't know why, I don't wanna have such a negative mind
It's compromising my desire of living a life
Please, oh please, oh listen to this cry of help
I love the life, but I feel different, different from everybody so
Leave me, leave me, leave me with my insanity

I wanna be happy
I wanna be free
I wanna dream, I just want to live my life
Like the other people do, but in agony this time

I wanna be, I wanna be free for myself
Thoughts are killing me
I'm not simple, I know, it's not simple to be me
Please please please, oh please
I love the life

I wanna be happy
I wanna be free
I wanna dream, I just want to live my life
Like the other people do, but in agony this time

I just wanna live
My life like the other people do
But I'm in agony
Agony
