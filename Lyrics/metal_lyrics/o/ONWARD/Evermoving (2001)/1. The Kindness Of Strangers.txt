Hello!!  
as you take a step back out of fear
it's just a primal reaction
Wait!! 
through the eyes of suspicious is clear 
why is it you don't trust me?

Gaze on a smile 
that is sweet and so haunting 
fixed on a feeling 
so wrong and attracting
Temptation rising, paralyzing, 
I won't do you harm

Gray is the hand!!
Of an elderly figure, 
shaking and frail
a faÃ§ade of soul darkness
Weak is the eye!!
To the passion of evil 
here we both stand 
we are two perfect strangers
Into my mind!!
Is the realm you shall ever discover 
my truth or my unholy purpose
Please take my hand!!
Take a chance for the first time
have no fear to the kindness of strangers

Good-bye!! 
I see that you are preparing to leave 
is it with or without me?
Go!! - to walk alone can be paradise 
that in time you will fall from

Witness a tear 
that can make you so happy 
a safe distance 
that could leave you so empty
Logistics rising, sterilizing
it will do you harm

Strong is the hand!!
Of a young fighting soldier 
clear minded strong 
a detractor of frailness
Strong is the eye!!
To the passion of evil 
nothing will change 
we are still perfect strangers
Out of my mind!!
Is the place you will take me 
to find all the lies 
and discover true sadness
Let go of my hand!!
Isolation now beckons 
fear I'll have 
to the kindness of strangers

Together we shall be
side by side we'll always walk alone

[SOLO]
