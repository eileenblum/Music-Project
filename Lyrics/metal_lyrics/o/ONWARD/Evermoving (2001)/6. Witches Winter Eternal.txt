Snow on Easter
cold is this morning gray
Frozen noontime 
no flowers will bloom today
I hear laughing 
Over her land of endless white
I am hungry
She'll feed a cold dish tonight

Her white winter eternal
cursed in stone 
of the lion's silent roar
Icy winter eternal
warmth of springtime 
caught in nevermore

Together 
we'll stand forever in stone
The world is mine
in frozen time
Whenever you dream of summer 
too late
Open your eyes 
to a northern frigid sky

Iron cauldron 
boils of Antarctic brew
Frozen nighttime 
her fire burns only blue
For she enjoys it 
Her tit is the metaphor
One can wonder 
will this be forevermore?

Wind filled winter eternal
cursed in stone 
is the sand time warrior
Witches winter eternal
dreams of summer 
lost in nevermore

[Repeat chorus]

[SOLO]

[Repeat chorus]
