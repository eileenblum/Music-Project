The sun has set, the sky so red 
harmless clouds are drifting high and pale
The moon so bright will make the night 
only as black as a widows vale
Some stars will live, 
some stars will fall
Northern lights will dance 
to no sound at all

Yet I hear song, of winter's wind
Through trees so long...dark whisper

The rest will sleep, 
their dreams they'll keep 
I'll stay awake to sensitize the night
I can hear such sounds 
no one else can hear
life it is so mystical
it's just that they have gotten used to it
Wolf's tears have fallen down 
remember me of lost saddened memories found

Still awake. Alone I'll take
Into my mind my midnight's kind
Day only hides the sounds 
that play within the dark
embrace your fears so near
When you know that there's no one else 
around for miles, 
your conscious will be clear

I have found the (sacred)
lost (secret) side (love)
of the world...
laced in true mystery

I live in the (never)
lost (ending) side (time)
forever here I shall stay...
