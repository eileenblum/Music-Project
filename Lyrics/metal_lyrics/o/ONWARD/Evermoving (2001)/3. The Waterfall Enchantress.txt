A crystal river is flowing 
and falling below 
Fact or fiction 
I've heard the tale 
of death lady's cove 
Many men come here 
to seek the enchantress divine 
lured by her power to heal saddened,
heartbroken minds
She stands behind the falls 
that crush the bodies onto jagged lime 
Blood mixed with water a crimson stream
now washes through mine

I can hear her song, a haunted melody
I can now see her face, unequaled beauty

Legend does say
a fearless heart 
will cross the falls unharmed
But who doth have
a fearless heart that's also broken

A warrior am I who's fought 
not wars of swords and armor
The thirst of loneliness 
I've tried to quench for all my life

Moving closer I gaze 
onto healing emerald eyes
Song of solace breathes 
through the lips of soothing red wine
Long flowing hair blows 
through whispers of wind from my dreams
Two arms that will embrace and hands
that will caress my longing face

Her voice now calls me clear
my fear's abandoned
Lustful were other men
whose souls have fallen

Can't see the spray 
that whips my face 
and robs the air I breathe
Thunder falls, 
such power that it dwarfs my body

Yet I continue on 
even if it means that I will drown
to know that I have felt 
the hope she gives forever moving

Moving on and on
To what ending? I still hear her song
Under or through the waterfall 
I now shall go

[SOLO]

Behind me water falls
my body is left behind
My soul now in her arms
enchanted I'll remain
on, on forever on...forever enchanted
