5 scores and 3 years my life's seen
My minds last command is read to me
No angel of death will take me away
my fear's washing away

So still while I'll rest
gaze upon the last sunset
Feel no cold, and I still see 
no fabled guiding light

My life's before my eyes
I'm ready now
My blood will flow its final round 
Onward to death the only way
I'm not afraid

Last smile, last pure breath
fade with the last sunset
I shall go to a place 
that I remember long ago

Soft endorphins soothe my mind 
dancing shadows play
as I die.

[SOLO]

Never departed or saw my body from above
a ghost I would not be
No memories of heaven or hell 
or of the Guff final passing

Open my new eyes
gaze upon the first sunrise
For now I'll forget
the day I'll see the last sunset

It's unending, all connecting 
never pausing, so relenting
Lives uncounted, days unnumbered
different bodies we live forever
