change in wind course 
blowing to northeast 
the wrath of sky unseen
but when the birds stop singing
crickets quiet its kind days quarantine
The wind's kiss is getting wetter
darkening, the truth of leaves now lie
Even though the air's electric, 
so eclectic 
I choose not to hide

It's time to cleanse the land again
so red was the morning sky
The endless clouds look so fed
The strongest elements collide
Welcome to nature's greatest show 
by the eye of the morning moon
With a twisted smile I now know...
storm coming soon!

Humble branches bow and face the other way
the sky's now evil green
Electric claw of lightning, applaud
power so unseen

One with the storm I here will stand 
so red was the morning sky
On a higher plane I will command 
The strongest elements collide
To see the center of it all 
by the eye of the morning moon
Wisdom I'll find or I shall fall
storm coming...soon
From the red of the morning sky
by the eye of the morning moon
storm coming soon

I feel sheltered yet I'm still outside
Now I enter onto the unknown inside

[SOLO]

One day you'll know...
By the red of the afternoon
by the light of the evening moon
midnight coming soon
