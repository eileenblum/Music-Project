Scared, oh where of body disappeared
kidnapped of my mate 
without a trace
(no case)
Tried to find, 
until I lost my mind
What crypt found on this earth 
would hold your place?
(I am)
Lost of cause 
not knowing where you are
or more important 
dead or you alive
(I need)
To know the fact, 
final answer if you will 
If I only could sleep now 
once again

Absolution
here I am at the end
Absolution
realized finalized
Absolution
without a sound, you are found
Absolution
seek my peace of mind

But wait, too late
Unfinished still I feel
Revenge is my own way 
to feed my rage
(I have)
Found the clown 
who toys with evil thoughts 
Good deeds were things 
that he lost long ago
(here I)
hide with time, 
patience is on my side 
When sleep will gall of then 
I shall now strike
[repeat]
Life you took, 
the method you will share 
and absolutely you will say 
good-bye!

Absolution
once again at the end
Absolution
realized finalized
Absolution
all is said, now you're dead
Absolution
found my peace of mind

Final, finne, over, ending 
all my past thoughts gone
Good does it feel 
when your mind can heal 
and life can now move on
I feel satisfied
Absolution mine!!

[SOLO]

Absolution mine!
Absolution mine!!
