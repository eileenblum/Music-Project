Burn as we run
Burn as we run
Run as our life burns away

Black is the clock of the cold synchronize
Pumping the blood of our pain

Turn away - far away

Never the first time
Do we forget when we're alone

Young child
Do you remember me
The rising sun of tomorrow begun
Who sets in sorrowed seas
You count the days that I'll sure spin away
No rest for my remembered
My power is one, your calendar done
Your night creating, daylight only sun

Fighting our time
For our time remembered
We'll roam the land
And cross the seven seas
The oceans four and the endless mountains
They only know the secret of her soul

Burn as we run
Burn as we run
Run as our life burns away

[Solo]

Our sun
Looks always down at me
We raise our brows just to stare at your eye
Forever - forever
Reflect your glare and absorb the rays of your fire - stronger
Our power is one as we begin the run
The quest to find the Neverending Sun

Fighting our time
For our time remembered
To let the stars see our own light shine
We'll burn the fools who will try to stop us
And take the hands
Of the ones she left behind

Rise again
(let the moon rise tonight)
To no end
(let her bathe in our light)
Find us again
(let time be our glory)
We feel no end
(why is it death that we all choose?)

[Solo]

Burn down the sun
Burn down the sun
Burn down the blistering sun
We will stand tall
let the burning one fall
Burn down the unending sun!

Away - Today!

United or one I will live with us all or alone!

The fool am I
I hold the loser's scepter
I chase her down to keep her high in the sky
Only to feel the ending, setting sun

I'll know my time
When my time's forgotten
Just like the candle
Fading in my sky
My dusk of dreams
Is the dust of darkness
Here in the cold is the warm of my demise

To try - To avoid my ending
To find - The everending
We'll find - The neverending
My Life - The Neverending Sun
