I walk alone
Forever I'm one
And I've always tried to believe
Stare at the sun
The Neverending one
Forever will she stare at me

Cold inside
Are the chilled bones of my pride
The keep me alive in the slow
Burn!

Strike hard the drum
The beat of the one
The heart that is mine will not bleed
Two-fold the sum
The problem's are one
Will cut through the eyes that still see

Bold inside
Is the flavor that tastes me
My senses will now tell me why

I answer the call
Respond to the unending awe
Thrown down to the mud
Like always before and again
We pay!

Tighten the hold
The gold I have won
The treasure I always will lose
Winning the game
Again I will play
A contest I will always choose

Now outside
Revealed is where I hide
No time for sleep, now I must run

I face now the pain
Unblinking I sing my new song
(I embrace the constant burning)
To crush all my frail
And breathe in the air of the strong
(feel my power then I'll go beyond)

Who is to say
Which day we will leave
(yet so many listen)
Do not as told
Is my only sound creed
(listen I no longer will)
