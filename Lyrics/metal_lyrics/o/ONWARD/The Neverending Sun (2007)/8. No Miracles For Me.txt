Running alone
Trying to get away
My path is chosen once more again

Hold on to my only discipline
My chips will fall where I choose to play
And how I'll play

And all the mistakes that I have made
I have made
And all the choices I will make
I will make . . . for me

To taste the glory
Or taste the steel that destroys me

The horse I ride
The reins are mine
Don't compromise the victor

I write my story
Only for these two eyes to read

I'll lose the game
I'll take the blame
And learn to play it better

No ray of light or force divine decides
No miracles for me

I know the sun brings another day
Night falls and cools off my own pain

And still my stone is not chipped away
with words of karma they proclaim
nothing's the same

And all the yesterdays I've made,
fade away
and all tomorrows that I'll make,
I will make
for me

hold on to glory
when times of failure do embrace

The road I drive
the wheel is mine
don't dare to cross the tyrant

I write my story
and play the part for all to see

I'll lose the game
and take the blame
and learn to play it better

No ray of light or force divine decides
no miracles for . . .

[Solo]

[Repeat chorus 1 and 2 except:]

Forever mine is what I will decide
the miracle is me
