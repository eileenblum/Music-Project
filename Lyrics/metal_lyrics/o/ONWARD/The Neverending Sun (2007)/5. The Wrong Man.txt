All through my life
All the time I've remembered
From when I was born
Could never tell the left from my right
But the right from wrong
I do admit that I am no angel
My dark room does tell me so
Yet seems when I think it's all right
. . . it's always wrong

Don't try to understand
The bane that's always haunted
No use in hearing how I ruined you
I'm the wrong man you have wanted

Plan for the days when the sun should shine
It always starts to rain
All of the nights I tried to be on time
Turn out too early or too late
I listen to all the things they teach
In the end I've learned in vain
Whenever I tried to make things right
It's in the wrong I am again

Don't try to understand
The bane that's always haunted
The ones who try to make a good man fail
I'm the wrong man they have wanted

I try to understand
By wrong I'm always hunted
Anything else that I can do wrong for you?
I'm the wrong man you've entrusted

Wrong question!
Wrong answer!
Always the wrong kind of attitude!
I always try to solve the problems
Emotions or logic
It doesn't matter which one I choose

I'm always wrong no matter what I say!

[Solo]

Another chance, a beginning again
To seek what I have wanted
The choices made in my life are all mine
To me they all have counted

You'll never understand
The bane that you've inflicted
I've always known who the wrong man is
They're the ones pontificating
(just go away)

So try to understand the bane that I have lifted
(and stay away)
Look in the mirror
All the times you accuse
It's the wrong man you've detected
