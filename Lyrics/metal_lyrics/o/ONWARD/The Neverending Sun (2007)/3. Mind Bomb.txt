The night is old and
The dreams are now drifting
The sun rises again
I try to rouse in the thick
Of the drowse to make my
day's commission
(tell me)
Why every time when I cover
My eyes, the loud, bright blare
Will scream again
I dare to look
And bite the hook
To chum our waters red

As I try to reason
(madness to reason)

I know inside the truthful lies

Light the short fuse of
The Mindbomb

Burn and spark away

From war to working
From trials that I fight each day
So long the fighting
Of sleepless minds and tired

The jealousy that the world
Will conceive
To kill the godless man
The seventh day will to
me only say, it's back
To work again
(too soon)
I pay the bills just to
Pay for my life, the tax
will born the bile
So take a look
And feel the cook
And bleed our eyes to red

Try to stay the madness
(reason to madness)

To prove the lie from truth inside
Set the timer of the Mindbomb

Tic, tock, tick away

From war to working
From trials that I fight each day
So long the fighting
Of sleepless minds and tired hands
The news is spreading
Farther, faster
To end each hour they
Calmly say
"Good night, be sure to
tune in tomorrow"
And we will wash
Our fears to death!

Where is the time
When we do not fear
The Darker vacations

When do we find
That time we all have is
Only for a living

How do we know
When we can stop this
Disgusting rat race

There's no goal
That we're crossing over

[Solo]

Diffuse, refuse
The pressure stays and
Shortens the countdown
From mouth to hand
In the cynical land
Our violence will amuse!

The love of madness
(our love of madness)

I know what steals the truth inside
Detonate the core of the Mindbomb
Blow your head away!
