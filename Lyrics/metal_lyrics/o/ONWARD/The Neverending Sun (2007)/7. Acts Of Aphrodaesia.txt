Act I, she enters the spotlight
Daylight curator
96k, drives a Mercedes Benz
Lives by her day planner

Beware in the moonlight
She'll crack the skin
To enjoy your blood
She'll stare with her sloe eyes
That will turn to ice
Likes the dark, warmer corners
She spills the pain of the candle's tears
By her order of leather
You will be her slave

By the words - you live by its command
The command - of AphrodÃ¦sia
Live the lust - the one endless demand
We demand - our AphrodÃ¦sia

Act II - He enters the spotlight
Corporate dictator
800k in a suit and a tie
Ruler of the sunlight

Cast down in the midnight
The cretin bound and his limbs hang high
Now cover his blue eyes
Choose torture device
Likes the loneliest dungeons
To feel the pull of the barbed wire ties
By order of metal
Pleasured by the vice

Meanwhile, the audience
Enjoys the voyeurism
No intermission in our play
That we desire

[Solo]

Tell me what happens
Tomorrow - when we all
Reawaken - Will we forget
Our debauchery - or find
The carnal answer?

[Solo]

Act III, I enter the spotlight
Eternal jester
Negative K, always tried to survive
Evermoving Onward

Indulge in the starlight
Consent the ones that will have no name
Fill my fetish of fervor
Taste the foreign flame
Meet me in the warm waters
And let your will now entangle mine
By order of passion
Life is now divine

[Repeat chorus 1]

In the night - you live in its command
The command of AphrodÃ¦sia
Live the years - get caught up in the act
In the Acts of AphrodÃ¦sia

[Chorus underlying vocals:]
By day we all have found
The will to find what we've been missing
Now look all around
'cos everybody wants a part in it

Turn the day around
The sin is not so upside-down
It's found in every town
The Acts of AphrodÃ¦sia
