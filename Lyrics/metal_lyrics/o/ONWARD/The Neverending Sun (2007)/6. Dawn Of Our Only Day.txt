Three suns shine
They shine forever
Neverending suns
They day-lit triad

Nightfall!
The tree that shine will end it all

They fall

Moonshine!
The myth that makes us paralyze!

Hold tight

Brother daylight
Lifelong time
Darkness descends
We must all endure . . .

Prepare your lives for darkest light
Starlight

One time
In life must we pass through the night

Cold fright!

Panic falls from our home near
Now we will hide and cling to our fear

We await the dawn of our only day
The time when our three suns
will sleep together
Far away is the dawn of our only day
The time when we live in the light
. . . Forever

Starlight
So terrified with open eyes
Cold light

Midnight
The coolness brings a strange desire
Silence!

Anxiety now falls to sway
Slowly I embrace this new-found calm

On other worlds this is the time
Earth kind

Alive
Am I to see this wondrous life
Behind . . .

The shade of everything we know
What danger did our elders feel below

Light the flame
'Til the dawn of our only day
Let the nightfall candle burn
Once again

We can wait
For the dawn of our only day
I need the memories of night
Forever

[Solo]

So long have I feared
the beautiful twilight

Now will I miss the soothing bright
Moonshine

Now we hate
The dawn of our only day
The dying dark awakens the light forever
Now we live
In the light of eternal day
I hope the dreamland that is night
Remembers me
