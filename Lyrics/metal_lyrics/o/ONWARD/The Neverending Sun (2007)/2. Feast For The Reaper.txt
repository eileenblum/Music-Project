Take the sun from a thousand lives
They are now cordially invited
To the end of flesh and fun
This party's only getting started

Where the Hell is Heaven now?
Only He, the Reaper responds
come inside and play
Did he speak or was it me?

The lights are out
The curtain rises
Feel a little frightened
I don't have the reason
Come on! - Time to play!

Feel a little hotter
Dead are now alive

Take my hand
And dance with me forever
Holding onto the last night of the never
He is entertained by your lifeline
(look away, look away from his eyes)
Let's toast to all our winters
The evening's feast is to die for
His banquet feeds your own demise
(take away, take away your life)

Feel the heat of the Midnight eyes
The Medusa stare will harden
Your journey's just begun
The morning never seems to matter

Hell will freeze when Heaven is found
Only now the Reaper rises
Will you dare to play
Did you die or was it me?

My heart shuts down
A certain crisis
Now I'm really frightened
Still don't have a reason
Come on! - Time to play!

Now I'm getting colder
Live into the dead

[Solo]

2am last call . . .
Time for all to fall

[Solo]

Take his hand and sleep forever
Letting go to the last night of together
He is unrestrained by killing time
Our host to all our winters
Has closed the feast he's devoured
The Reaper's feast is our demise!
