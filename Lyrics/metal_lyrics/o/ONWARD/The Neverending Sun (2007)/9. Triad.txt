The tree in the keep
Unaltered future
UncursÃ©d Triad
The sun of father time
Belongs to thee
Hold
Let us now pass the time
Still there is much more to conquer

Where are they and who are we
The early morning workers
Lists that tell the time
The days are getting better

We're born, we grow
We learn, we cry
We love, we live
We hate, we lie

And then we die

We re all our own foundation

High is the moonlight
She leads the tides of faithful oceans
Around the sunlight
The nine gone gods forever dancing
Dead in the desert
Stay the four of stone
Grown triads, I need to wonder
What will we leave behind
When we are gone

Release
We crave to kill the time
Still there is much more
To answer

Where will we go
And what will be
The kings of all discarded
Songs that have no time
And still the years are testing

We play, we sleep
We sing, we scream
Believe the hope
That they defy

And still we die

Strongest is the point
Where one meets three

[Repeat chorus except]

And still I wonder
What will we leave
Behind tomorrow

[Solo]

Now - what lies ahead is what we fathom
Ahead - the Triad never dies
Behind - are the days that we
are forced to remember
I feel - the Neverending Sun
is setting soon

Burn as we run . . .
The Neverending Sun
