Evil will follow

Faculty X speaks to me and again it's calling
I feel it warning me of something darker than kind purpose
Always I, the rod of lightning from the blackest clouds advancing
Finding, seeking me to haunt my days of virtue

It's not me, yet they all think so (melancholy mercenary)
I'm just here, a bystander (stealing, borrowing the peace)
Cool and calm is my true nature (burning madness perceiving)
Stay away, I am the force

You feel in my presence
Keep far, beware, it is me

Evil does follow

Traveling to distant places does not matter because it's isolation that gives the
strength to use the blade
Two men fight and one will win with a knife of steel that cuts through tin
and I am just the witness who was not the cause

To kill and see the crimson blood flow (intoxicating visions blind me)
Still, with fear, I dare not move (glassy eyes filled with salt tears)
Try to warn, I will soon infect (try to keep the peace, it's failing)
Stay away, I am the force

You feel in my presence, stay far when I am near
Believe my real danger
Keep far, beware, it is me

Evil does follow

Where evil does follow is where I have been
Unfortunate sorrow finds just where I am
Where evil will follow is where I'm going to
Try to outpace it's maneuvers too deadly

I'm where evil follows

Where evil does follow is where I have been
And all the blame it spawns comes back to where I am
Where evil will follow is where I'm going to
I have now accepted it's cause from me to you

(evil will follow)

Where evil does follow
Is where I have been
(evil does follow)
Might as well just use it's power for my revenge
(my evil's followed)
Where evil will follow is where I'm going to
(where evil follows)
Don't you dare and try to follow its power too
