End of days, my greatest fear
My body tires and sleep is near
Close my eyes and I will pray for dreams of rapture
But still it comes, the storm of spiraling clouds of nightmares chasing
me.
Fed from boiling seas of sorrow, blackened yawns of deadpan horror

Stand, upon these shores and wait for my own storm
Learn to endure, like always before. My eyes will see
If I hold on I'll be, within the soothing center, calming, restful solace

Try to enter

Not forever in the eye of the nightmare
As you enter, feel the eye of the nightmare
Trapped inside the violent eye of the nightmare
Lucid colors sees the eye of the nightmare

Try to run but in all dreams our bodies fail, we want to sleep
Kin and loved ones torn apart by winds of torture
Be still, I feel a million legs of angry insects, hungry I sense
Peel away from faceless children, from them I hear young screams of terror

Hold my body down, so scared without the sound
My lost dreams found, frightened all around
It's just a dream
Hold on and I'll soon be, within the guarded, peaceful, quiet, sunlit
palace

Try to stay here

Now forever in the eye of the nightmare
Peace I will find from the eye of the nightmare
Lost inside behind the eye of the nightmare
(within, the end, behind the)
Tearful madness sees the eye of the nightmare
(always, open is the)

Frozen lies and frozen stares of subconscious thoughts, they're not really
here
The only to leave the eye is through the storm wall
Dreams of burning, dreams of drowning
They're all just to me, elementary nightmares
I'll stay in the eye and sleep forever, sweat through the storm
Hope I can wake

As the storm clouds fade it looks like I will wake to another day
All's well now until I see the sun fall down (only close one eye)
