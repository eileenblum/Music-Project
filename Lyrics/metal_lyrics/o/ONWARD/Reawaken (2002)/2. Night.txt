The unborn darkness lives in day
The youth of dusk will soon grow older
Mature into the air of black

Steal your blood from nocturne prey
Embrace a million suns much darker
Caress the other world of night

The night cooling refuge
From southern's sun so endless
A polar summer midnight's shine

Night, my night, day's oasis
Where all my dreams still survive
A paradise I'll lose too sun from sleep

Summer, northern sunshine
Endless, midnight daylight
White night, insane sunshine
Madness

Go to where I'll meet the dark
The winter of polar sullen
It's where the noon is filled with black

Give your eyes to evil's play
Gaze upon a moon much truer
The strength of arms that hold
The Night

The Night, inspiration
For my own silent pleasures
Let fall the star of earthly life (for my night)

Night, my night, light forsaken
Where my power is alive
A paradise that's found earth's own shade

Winter, polar darkness
Endless, midday nighttime
All night, lost is sunshine
Eternal night

Come and see where your loyal shadows always betray
Come with me once cleansed of fear
Night's love will make you stay

Autumn, days grow shorter
Colder, nights grow longer
Seasons, change through time
(Forever) night, still seeking

Darker places call me
Hiding doesn't cure me
Expose my whole being to the night
