can see you're tears inside,
they don't show often anymore.
You have to cry out,
the pain inside you know,
they don't show.
The pain inside you know,
let the pain inside you go

I am the fault,
yes I am.
I am the one to blame,
then throw me into the flames.

Why can't you hear you're own thoughts.
The glory is just another dream.
You have to cry out,
the pain inside you know,
they don't show.
The pain inside you know,
let the pain inside you go.
