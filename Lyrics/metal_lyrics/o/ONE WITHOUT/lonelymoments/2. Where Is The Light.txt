Hearts are broken,
where is the truth now.
I'm seeing thru glass houses,
thin as the mask you're behind.
Hours of happiness,
days of regrets.
I hope you go thru same hell,
that you put me thru.

Where is the light,
I can't find it any longer.
Where is the time,
the time that always was forgotten.

Who cries now,
when the hell crawls out again.
Disappointed eyes stares at you.
The words won't come out,
no need to wonder why.

The rain never stops,
falling on you.
