The night falls again,and lonely moments calls me in,reminds me of my sin.I'm wondering thru my thoughts,my head spins,it feels like an hell ride.Will this ever come,will this ever come to an end. Wondering, I'm wondering about tomorrow,wondering, I'm wondering,will it be the same. Let me dream of a place,where I won't be alone,a place that I can call home.Let me dream of a place,where I won't be alone,a place that I can call home. The morning brings the light,another night comes to an end,reminds me once again.I'm still here in the dark,my head spins,it feels like an hell ride,will this ever come,will this ever come to an end.
