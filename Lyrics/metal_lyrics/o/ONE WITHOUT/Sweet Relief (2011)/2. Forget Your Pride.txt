Don't fake your laugh
No I know you're smiling
Only to cover a lack of confidence
Forget your pride
Don't give a shit about
What others think
No one knows you
Better than yourself

So follow your intuition
Let people stare
And say a t least I'm being
Honest to myself to who I am

Don't be afraid
Be true and honest
And it will make you
Way more confident
Skip your pointless talk
Don't try so hard
To impress the mob
They will only
Stab you in the back

Don't fake your laugh
Don't be afraid of yourself
They will only back stab you
