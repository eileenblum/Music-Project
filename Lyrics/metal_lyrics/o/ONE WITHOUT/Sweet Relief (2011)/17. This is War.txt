My first reaction
Was not to run
Then I knew and
The war was on

Why is it so hard for me
To see when someone is
So obviously drowning me

Can you help me please
Help me break free
From this sick sad habit

I'm fire you gave me water
Can't you see
I need the heat I feed on heat

Can't you see you're killing me
From underneath
You're killing me

I'm on fire
I'm gonna fight 'til the end
Walls are breaking
This is war
