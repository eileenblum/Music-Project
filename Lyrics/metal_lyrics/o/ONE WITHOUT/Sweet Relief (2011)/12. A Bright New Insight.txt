The pressure of the fingers
From the ideals
They point out my direction
I'm nothing but a slave to a fool
Who sets out the rules

We will make the rules
Not you

Today you left us
As we watched you fly away
Can't say I really knew you
But I would have liked to see you stay

The reason why I smiled
When I said my last good bye
I knew
Bright insight
I will make my life worthwhile

Trust
I trust the insight
I will make my life worthwhile

Controlled by a conscience
That tells me what to do
And what not to
I'm nothing but a slave to a fool
Who is setting the rules

Please help me understand
Please help me understand this
Understand
Why should you waste your life
On something
You don't want to do
