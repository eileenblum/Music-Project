I'm sick of being stuck in this
It's like I'm not even here at all
I wonder if anyone knows who I am
If anyone knows how I feel

I stand here alone
Afraid of who I am
Afraid of being something
I don't wanna be

I'm waiting for a sign to say
You're doing fine
I can see that you're trying

The hours of doubt
Is tearing me apart
So clear your throat
And spit it out

I'm Sick of being lost in this
I'm slowly fading away
