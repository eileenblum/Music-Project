You've become too blind to see
And too ignorant to care
How can you live with yourself
You're nothing but a pretender

You're choosing sides
Based on stories and fiction
Try to see things from my eyes
And let me know can you justify
Your actions if you see
They're hurting me

You try so hard to make life a show
Just to hide your true emotions
You're blindfolding yourself
As an attempt to fight anxiety
It's easier to live a lie
