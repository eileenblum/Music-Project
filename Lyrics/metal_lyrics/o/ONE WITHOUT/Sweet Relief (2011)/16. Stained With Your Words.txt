You tell me I've got issues
I'm gonna let you know
That my only issue is you
You're my only issue

Shut up
Don't need your preaching
It's always been the same old story

You stained me with your words
Long before I even knew what they meant
I can't wash it off me

You say I have to be saved
The time has come for redemption
But I can't bare your lies
So get the hell away from me

Take one step back
It's always been the same old story

Can't bare your lies
Get the hell away from me
Can't bare your lies
Get the hell away
