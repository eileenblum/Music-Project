Lifeless soulless useless
And degraded punch bags
Hated unwanted
Useless rotten stinky
Piece of shit

You never wanted us
To be a part of you
We were the ones
Who always had to step aside
And everything was based on your permission
You despised and scorned us
But we stuck together
You and I
There was never a time
Where we left each other's side

You tried to break us
But together we were strong.
The marks you gave our bodies
Only made our close bonds
Even tighter

We were worth nothing to you
There was never a time
Where we left each other's side

You tried to break us
But you only made us stronger
Now we will show you
How we do thing on our own
