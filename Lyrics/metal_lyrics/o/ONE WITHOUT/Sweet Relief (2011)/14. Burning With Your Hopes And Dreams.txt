Searching always trying
To find a place, to hide your sorrow
Fleeing from everyone
You're writing on the wall, trust no one

Wait up now and tell me
Are you feeling satisfied
With the way things turned out
Or do you wanna make a change
I'm afraid it is too late

When your mind gets twisted
And every bridge
You've ever walked in your life
Is burning with your hopes and dreams

So many years have been wasted
From the way you seem to
Live for chaos, you're burning
With your hopes and dreams

Those who cared about you left
Don't seem to understand, what happened
Smash your head against the wall
Destruction is your way to manage

Wait up now and tell me
Are you feeling satisfied
Or do you wanna make a change

The way your mind is twisted
It's not so odd
As you wasted all those years
So many years gone wasted
Because of the way
You seem to live for chaos
