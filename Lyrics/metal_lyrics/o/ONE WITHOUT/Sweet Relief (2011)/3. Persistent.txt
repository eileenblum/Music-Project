Used to keep it as my secret
Now I use it as an open truth

Consume all energy
Crating a void
What I/we have today will grow
Stronger by tomorrow

We live for tomorrow
By living for today
As heroes
Make way for tomorrow
And see what happens
If you play your cards right

We feel like kings
And we're not faking.
Brand new worlds revealed
Before your eyes

Play them right
Play them all out
