There's no one else to blame for this
I've suffered before
I should have seen the signs
That screamed in red
But I guess I've lost all sense

With fear I look into your accusing eyes
How could this go so wrong
I used those who believed in me
I became a martyr

I'm not the one you thought I'd be
No savior in me
I took your soul and threw it all away
I guess I've lost all sense

I never wanted you to see
What lies in me
