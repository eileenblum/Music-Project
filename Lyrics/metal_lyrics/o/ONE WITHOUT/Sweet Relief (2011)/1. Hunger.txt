This behavior I'm addicted to
Is my lover and archenemy in one

Please feed my inner hunger
Please satisfy my need for a kick

Let me have you
And consume you
Till there's nothing more to gain
You talk about mercy
I say I have no shame

I feel no shame at all

Such behavior makes you wonder
What a misery this poor thing
Has gone through

Am I a heartless person
Is there no hope in me
I'm hurting
I can see you leaving me
