Old friend stupidity
Grabs my wrist
And leads my heart right back
Into your treacherous arms

I should have known
Your bad intentions
But I get hypnotized
Just looking at you

The way you touch
My skin tonight
Says you want me to come close
My poor judgment lets you in
Like so many times before
And I get burned once again

Thought I knew myself
Was in control
Now I see that
Foolishness will Take its toll

You grab my wrist
You lead me in
Break the shield
You touch my skin
My defense is too weak
