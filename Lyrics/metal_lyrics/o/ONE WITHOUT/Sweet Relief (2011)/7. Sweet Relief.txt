With a gun to my head he says
We must put an end to this
And I say you said you loved me
But I know
I've seen it pictured in my head

All my fears are gone
Sweet relief I welcome you
This I've been waiting for all my life

To the pace of my beating heart
He starts a dance to death
One shot and the dance is over
For him but not for me
I'm finally free from his chains

All my life I tried
To find my way back home
I tried but I couldn't do it alone
