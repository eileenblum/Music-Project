One look at you
That lasts for a second
Stays forever in me
The most beautiful thing I've seen
I'm so afraid of loosing you
That I can't have you near

I told you to go away
But the truth is
I can't live without you
I need you here with me

We're on different sides of the world
But somehow
Something brought us together
I don't know if I believe
In such a thing
But I'd like to call it destiny

I don't know how
But I guess I just knew
You are the one I wanna have till I die
I can see our footprints
Leaving traces for others to follow
I never want you to go away from me

You're in my arms and I know
I want you near me forever
