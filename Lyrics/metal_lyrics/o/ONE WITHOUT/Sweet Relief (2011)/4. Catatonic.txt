To kill all the noise
That's eating me from inside
I put the glass to my mouth

Thinking it will/would make me stronger
Thinking it will/would make them
Go away
Make the devils go away

They vanish for a second
But only to return even stronger
When it's all
It's fucking me up
I want to run
Escape from myself
But I am stuck here
With these twisted voices
Now it's all
It's fucking me up

You know that day
I stood in your room
You screamed
Got scared
And I was ready to die

Away away
I have to kill all the noise
Inside me head
'Cause I can't hear
What you say anymore

In a body filled with panic
Like the state of an addict
I can see the fist in my face again
A fist to sooth my burning skin
