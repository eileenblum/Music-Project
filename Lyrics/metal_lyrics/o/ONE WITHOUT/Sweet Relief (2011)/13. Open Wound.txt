Everyone is counting down
With excitement
I wonder what you're all
So badly waiting for

For you tomorrow will be
Just like any other day
For me it means a nightmare
How the hell will I survive

A new day is dawning
My body shivers to the bones
With the disgust I feel for you
A new day is dawning
My body is an open wound
Can I survive this day on my own

I don't understand the point of your existence
Because you're doing the same things
Over and over again

For you tomorrow will be
Just like any other day
You gave it up, let me down
For me it's a nightmare
Now how the hell will I survive this day
You gave me up, I'm falling down
I will, can I survive
