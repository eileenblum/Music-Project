The twinkle in you're eyes,
the tempt in your smile.
The beauty of your skies,
runs all the time,
in my mind.

Everything reminds me of the bad days.
I didn't even know how to feel.
This soul lives forever cold,
this frozen soil is for you,
is for you.
This frozen soil is for you,
this frozen soil is...

The softness of you skin,
the taste of your lips.
The feeling of you touch,
runs all the time,
in my mind.

Everything reminds me of the bad days.
I didn't even know how to feel.
This soul lives forever cold,
this frozen soil is for you,
is for you.
This frozen soil is for you,
this frozen soil is...
