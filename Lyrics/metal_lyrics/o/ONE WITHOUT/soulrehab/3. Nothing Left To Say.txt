A lonely portrait,
hanging in a dark room,
describing sorrow.
She cries all night,
her shade holds me near.
I'm lost in her lies.

To die alone,
to feel the empty darkness fade you away,
there's nothing left to say.
To sleep awake,
to see the lake with swans and bright white skies,
no reason left to stay.
Hey I'll been watching over you.
Hear my sadness that I left behind me.

Who knows the answer,
for this cold desire,
like a winter breeze.
Her frozen lost soul,
which I cannot reach.
I'm lost in her lies.

To die alone,
to feel the empty darkness fade you away,
there's nothing left to say.
To sleep awake,
to see the lake with swans and bright white skies,
no reason left to stay.
Hey I'll been watching over you.
Hear my sadness that I left behind me.
