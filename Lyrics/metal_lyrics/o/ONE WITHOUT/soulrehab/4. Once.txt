When did you get so cold.
You are someone I don't know.
See what you have become.
I don't know you anymore.
Once I felt, you where my world.

Once I needed you,
I believed in you,
my soul bled for you,
now you so far,
so gone stay away.

Once I needed you,
I believed in you,
my soul bled for you,
now you so far,
so gone stay away.

I'm about to loose my innocence.
This life dies fast as it has grown.
Once I felt, you where my world.

Once I needed you,
I believed in you,
my soul bled for you,
now you so far,
so gone stay away.
