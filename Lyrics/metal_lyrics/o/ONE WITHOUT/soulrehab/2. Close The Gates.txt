The happiness runs right through me.
Look at me,
this is better than any ecstasy.

Oh heaven can wait,
I'm not ready for the light,
so close the gates,
I just stay another night.
So heaven can wait,
close the gates,
close the gates.

Now I found my place in destiny,
now we walk side by side,
it's no longer my enemy.
I used to live my life,
looking backwards in regret.
But now I'm thankful for,
every second I get.

Oh heaven can wait,
I'm not ready for the light,
so close the gates,
I just stay another night.
So heaven can wait,
close the gates,
close the gates.

So many times I cursed life,
life it self.
But now I'm thankful.
Now I'm thankful of,
no more being,
no more being down there.
