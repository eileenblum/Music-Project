Here we are,laid down on a field to observe the skies.Something always kills the things,to remember.Something always kills the things,that I want to remember.Like last september,that I remember.You know who you are. Say you feel the air tonight.Say you see the solutions in sight.Say you feel the air tonight.Say you see the solutions in sight. It dies, something worth to remember.Like last september,I want to remember.You know who you are.
