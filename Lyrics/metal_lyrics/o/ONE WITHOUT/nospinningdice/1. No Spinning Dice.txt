Your loss of life prays as you sign in your psycho state of mind. I'm sick of all lies, look fireflies. You tried and you tried handle the game but things will always stay the same it all begun, with no sun  Drown into sleep for awhile dive in to a world thru my eyes (there's no spinning dice).  In your cute and sweet liberation there is no use for a major celebration here my words on your street there's no light. You stabbed and you stabbed and killed your own game you really should be ashamed it all begun, with no sun.
