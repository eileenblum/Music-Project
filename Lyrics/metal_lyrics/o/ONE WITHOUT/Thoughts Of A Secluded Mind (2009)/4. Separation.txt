Divided in two with all touch forbidden
Can't be the one you used to
And your hand's been given
You're staring at that broken queen

Silent tears are running
Which makes the burden fade a bit
But this separation
Won't ever loose it's colour when

(scream)
The voices in your head are screaming
Wanting you to go beyond control
And crave for remedy
The voices in your head are screaming
(they are screaming)
Nothing seems more true to you
In your search for remedy

Striving to find what's gone missing
There's no way you'll move quietly
With a mind that's trembling
An earthquake is upon your door

Soon you'll hear the signal
They're trying
To bring you back on track
But this separation
Won't ever lose it s colour when

Far from what is safe and sound
Fall into oblivion
Ignore the things that used to
Haunt you down and leave you helpless
Bring you into nothingness
You hear the doom but choose not to respond
Puts the light in darkness
All you had to choose was the life of mortality

The voices in your head are screaming
(they are screaming)
Wanting you to go beyond control
Go beyond control
And crave for remedy
