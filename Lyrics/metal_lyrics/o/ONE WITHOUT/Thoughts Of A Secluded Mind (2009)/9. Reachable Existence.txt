With the amount of despising situations
You end up in everyday
Your hate won't surprise anyone
Say who knows what it takes to find you
A new and unmarked path
That leads your mind
To a warm and reachable existence

You say you don't know where your heart is
But your mouth
Still screams out your heartbeats
Don't fall in the trap
Wherever you go
There's always something trying to get to you

Who cares if the rumours they spread are true
Make room for more than just yourself
And get rid of all those illusions
Now the madness colours your skin
Revenge is in your hands
Wake up and face
The desperate acts of delirium
