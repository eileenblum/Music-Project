Who made that first silent move
that would make the standings
quiver for so long
who was the one that
brought us hope and made us
loosen the ropes round our necks

Now it's all just a question of time
before we all

Bring out what is inside
our muzzled hearts
we can make it if we try
so hold on time is right

Look at yourselves and believe
in what you have to do
to break free
show no sign of mercy
for the ones that pushed us down
and made us crawl for our lives

Now it's all just a question of time
before we all

Bring out what is inside
our muzzled hearts
we can make it if we try
so hold on time is right

See the rolling heads
that used to spit in your face
they won't do you nothing now
when you're safe
