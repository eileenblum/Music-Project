So many sleepless nights I have
Been trying to understand my faith
The distance between myself and I
Is growing deeper every time

Now I'm going beneath the surface
Of this undecided world
I'm going to find the purpose
To all the suffocation I have to
Go through

Repeatedly ruin the fruits that I've sown
The taste of life won't touch my lips
A true believer I could be
If I would find tranquillity
