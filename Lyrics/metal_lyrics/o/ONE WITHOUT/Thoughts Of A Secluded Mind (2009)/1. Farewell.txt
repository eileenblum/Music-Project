Lost your track of time
chasing ashes of yourself
no one sees the pain

It is locked behind that stone
cold mask that you wear
so just take it off

Leave the world you hold in
make yourself a favor
and give the ones you love a
chance to say farewell

Choose your actions well
when the time has come to show
who you really are

It is locked behind that stone
cold mask that you wear
so just take it off

Leave the world you hold in
make yourself a favor
and give the ones you love a
chance to say farewell

Stay to see what's gone in vain
then turn the page and face reality
don't go looking for a hero
it is all about you

Leave the world you hold in
make yourself a favor
and give the ones you love a
chance to say farewell
