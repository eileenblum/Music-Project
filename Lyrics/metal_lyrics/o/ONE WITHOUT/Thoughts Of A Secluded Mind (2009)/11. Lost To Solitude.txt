Say how long ago was it now
You left and it seemed like
My world would fall apart
I was struggling trying to find
Something to grip
But I would always fall behind
Now I wonder I wonder

Can I ever find myself
Forget about old memories and lies
That made me feel so cold
Can I ever fight the pain
Forget about old promises and lies
That made me feel so cold

Lost to solitude through unchosen ways
Deemed to be the one
That fights for herself
Face the lunacy and sanity will reign
Though it's hard because you'll
Always feel ashamed
Now I wonder I wonder

With a frozen heart deep inside
Giving up my soul
For the warmth of another
Who can I ever be to blame
