One wanted to go down to the other side
Where life would shine upon him
and feelings would unite
He tried to look the other way
When someone screamed his name
He left without the shame

To this point there is
No ending to this story
He will do what he believe in
By fair means or foul

Responsibility brings power
But he left his cause
To try his feet on water
Loosing the hand
Can someone show him
Rip the curtains and reveal
The consequences of his deeds
