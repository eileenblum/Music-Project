All my life I've been taught
To make an enemy of myself
Breaking down feeling emptiness
Inside myself

Down where the winds will change
Is a turning
Though I'm almost there I can't feel it
Demons reign with hate
Making all my struggle go to waste
In a heartbeat

Wanna scream words out loud
See the failure in this system
Growing strong fight the enemy
That kills me slowly

Born with a constant feeling
That someone is watching
Your every move
You feel you can't make it on your own
Need someone to cover up your back
and give you answers
Give you answers

All my life I've been taught
To make an enemy of myself
