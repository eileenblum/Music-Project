Once in silence it is hard to bring it back
The sound that leads me forward
And makes living worth again

Our dreams will not go wasted
Deep striving made me come this far
Those who tried to crush us
I don't have much to spare for you
At all

Self-fulfillment shows
The meaning of our lives
Deep inside you lies
A treasure ready to come forth
Understanding is the answer to our cries
Leave the thoughts
That tries to eat you all behind

What lies beneath the wishes of our minds
Can someone show me what it's all about
Bring clearness and I'll grant you
That the truth will lead us all the way
All the way
