Can we all see?
Can we believe?

Sleepwalking through my waking state
Or wake walking through my dreams
I owe it all to this alliance
For everything
They helped me find my way
Changed my dreams to my reality

Can we all see?
That this dream inside me
It's more than sleep
If we won't go now who would we be?
Can we believe?
We are not alone as it may seem
We will be the ones we strive to be

These memories of the gasoline,
The sky begin to fade away
My past will be unanchored to the present day
Sleepwalking through my waking state
Or wake walking through my dreams
I owe it all to this alliance
For everything
They helped me find my way
Changed my dreams to my reality

A renegade with real mercy
Lost in the face of some demon

Can we all see?
That this dream inside me
It's more than sleep
If we won't go now who would we be?
Can we believe?
We are not alone as it may seem
We will be the ones we strive to be

Can we sing together
This dream lasts forever

I'm not just a boy
But a man that has to tools
To sink to swim
To grow a love
A love that sees the truth
'Cause the spark deep inside me has something to say
The spark deep inside of me that won't go away
For all the years and tears
I've learnt that winners
Winners
Winners
All did lose

(Can we sing together)
(This dream lasts forever)

For all the years and tears
I've learnt that winners
Winners
Winners
All did lose
