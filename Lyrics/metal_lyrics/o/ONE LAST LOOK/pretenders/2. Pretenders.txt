I never wanted to break down through this corruption.
Breathe in and out all your sorrows and pain.
Give me a sign to return from the darkness;
shed me some light, show me what's right.

Did I hear you say, "What do we live for"
when everything we care about is fading away?
I swear I heard you say "What do we live for"
can we think about it, talk about it?

And we'll pretend the lies we refused to see
were easier to make than believe.
And if forgetting to choose was a way to the truth,
you know we'd lose it.

I remember these words you placed in my head.
And made me regret all the things that I said!

Where were you all last night?
Take time to think about it...
Everything you've ever known we had is dead and gone.

Every second within every moment,
the only thought of you was a lie.
A mother fucking lie.
Every second within every moment,
I lost it in the blink of an eye.

And we'll pretend the lies we refused to see
were easier to make than believe.
And if forgetting to choose was a way to the truth,
you know we'd lose it.

The lies we refused to see are
easier to make than believe.
And if forgetting to choose was a way to the truth...

You know we would lose it.

Black, my heart is filled with rage,
and at the end of the story

These words will never (never)
never (never) guide you back to me.

I never wanted to break down through this corruption.
Breathe in and out all your sorrows and pain.
Give me a sign to return from the darkness;
shed me some light, show me what's right.
