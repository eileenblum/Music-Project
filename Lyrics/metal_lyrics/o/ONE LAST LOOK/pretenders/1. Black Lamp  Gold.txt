With lies so dark you'll keep them and hope as bright as gold, 
we all know the truth the world is black and gold. 
With lies so dark you'll keep them wrapped around your throat, 
we all know the truth the world is black and gold. 

With lies so dark you'll keep them and hope as bright as gold, 
we all know the truth the world is black and gold. 
With lies so dark you'll keep them wrapped around your throat, 
we all know the truth...

The world is black and gold!

We all know the truth the world is black and gold.
