Dreamer, imagine a world with no bright stars.
Dreamer, imagine a life where we could start over.
The sun has passed, the moon is gone, but my ship is sailing on.

Hoist the sails, anchors aweigh.
We're moving on.
I never wanted it to be this way.

And now I'm finally free there's no more chains.
Well so long, so long.
I'm sailing to a brand new world.
Yes now I'm finally free.
You can have your chains cause so long, so long.
I'm sailing to a brand new world.

I'm sailing to a brand new...
Freedom has never been so beautiful.
I've got my sights set for south.
And I'm not looking back.
I won't look back.

And now I'm finally free there's no more chains.
Well so long, so long.
I'm sailing to a brand new world.
Yes now I'm finally free.
You can have your chains cause so long, so long.
I'm sailing to a brand new world.

Yes, now I'm finally free.
Yes, now I'm free.
So long, so long, so long.

Dreamer imagine a world
(with no bright stars)
Dreamer imagine a world
(with no bright stars)

I am free
From these chains that have locked me away.
I never wanted, I never wanted it to be this way.
Where will I go? What will I do, now that I'm rid of you?
So long, so long I'm sailing to a
Brand new world.
