Remember when we thought we were friends?
I knew back then that this was gonna end.
But not this soon, oh no, no, no.
With bitterness comes emptiness.

The gold edges of my heart will never fade to gray.
With every notion and attempt that I made,
you lost all composure when I needed something.
But you're better off in a world of wrong.

All alone; on my own.
Thinking back on everything you took from me,
the signs were there, but I couldn't believe, no.
All alone; on my own.
Thinking back on everything you took from me,
the signs were there, but I wouldn't believe, no.

This is the calm before the storm.
This is the plight of the wretched one.
Yeah.
And now I'm wasting away, in a crowded room so alone.
Fuck this shit, I'm so fed up with you.
I'll leave you speechless, scared and confused
with every lie that you told from the start.
You always told me not to take them to heart.

All alone; on my own.

All alone; on my own.
Thinking back on everything you took from me,
the signs were there, but I couldn't believe, no.
All alone; on my own.
Thinking back on everything you took from me,
the signs were there, but I wouldn't believe, no.

Remember when we thought we were friends?
I knew back then that this was gonna end.
But not this soon, oh no, no, no.
With bitterness comes empty...

All alone; on my own.
Thinking back on everything you took from me,
(you took from me)
the signs were there, but I couldn't believe, no.
All alone; on my own.
Thinking back on everything you took from me,
(you took from me)
the signs were there, but I wouldn't believe, no.

The gold edges of my heart will never fade to gray.
With every notion and attempt that I made,
you lost all composure when I needed something.
You lost all composure when I needed something.
