I can push forward
I can push forward

Brick walls surround my kingdom as I watch my enemies fall.
I forged the sword of grace, sharpened blades I fixed inside my victims chests.
I was one of the few to create the end of justice.
Now I walk the path of hate that love has crumbled down.

Has crumbed down.

When will you see it's over?
These walls have crumbled down to the ground.
So sorry that I can't be the man you need.

Take it back a hundred years and it still wouldn't change a thing.
With different motives different thoughts and different dreams, my life never
meant a thing.
Take it back a hundred years (a hundred years); my life never meant a thing.

When will you see it's over?
These walls have crumbled down to the ground.
So sorry that I can't be the man you need.
(The man you need)
Take your life get out of town now,
don't waste a second 'cause there's nothing here for you.
When will you see it's over?
(It's over, it's over)
It's over now

It's over now

Woah

My dreams can set me free.

My complex isn't what it seems.
She was a thief that stole all of my, all my dreams.

All of my dreams.

When will you see it's over?
These walls have crumbled down to the ground.
So sorry that I can't be the man you need.
(The man you need)
Take your life get out of town now,
don't waste a second 'cause there's nothing here for you.
When will you see it's over?
(It's over, it's over)
It's over now
(it's over, it's over)
It's over now.
