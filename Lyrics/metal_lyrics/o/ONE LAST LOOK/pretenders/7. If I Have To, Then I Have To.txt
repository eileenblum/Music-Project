I grasped the light of the moon seeking vengeance that's within.
I feel the breath of whispers when the phantom calls my name.
Phantom I hear the whispers of your voice.
It leaves me heartless to attack her soul.

What was I thinking this time when you played your games with me?
Every time you left me broken.
Do my words mean nothing at all?
If I have to, then I have to walk away and pretend I don't need you.
So I'll take this time to think about the fire we watched burn out.

Oh god, please hear me when I speak your name.

I grasped the light of the moon seeking vengeance that's within.
I feel the breath of whispers when the phantom calls my name.

I chose the path of self-vision I let dwell in my heart.
When I transform I feel my skin rip apart.

What was I thinking this time when you played your games with me?
Every time you left me broken.
Do my words mean nothing at all?
If I have to, then I have to walk away and pretend I don't need you.
So I'll take this time to think about the fire we watched burn out.

I gotta try to keep calm and carry on.
I keep tearin' my, tearin' myself down.
Cause you caught me at the wrong time.
Did my words mean nothing at all?

What was I thinking this time?
Every time you left me broken.
Do my words mean nothing at all?

What was I thinking this time when you played your games with me?
Every time you left me broken.
Do my words mean nothing at all?
If I have to, then I have to walk away and pretend I don't need you.
So I'll take this time to think about the fire we watched burn out.

What was I thinking this time?
What was I thinking this time?
Do my words mean nothing at all?
