Follow along...
Follow along...
Follow along, let me show you what I see, yeah..
Follow along, with the key around your neck...
Follow along.

I couldn't change a thing since the day we met.
I was just a mess and everything was spinning.

You know the way I am and the way I live, but something else controls me.
You have been marked.
When the crowd is watching I can't keep it in.
I need help.
But if it's you I can't guarantee you'll live.

Follow along let me show you what I see, yeah.
You are the one with the key around your neck.
Follow along if you can just keep quiet.
You are the one.
Will you save the world tonight?

Yeah you don't know what, you don't know what you had.
Yeah you don't know what, you don't know what you had.

Too late.
And the other me takes you to the other side.
Stay calm.
Cause no one can stop this, no one can stop me.

I haven't changed a thing since my last confession.
I think I blacked out, I think it's taking over.
Wolves don't the beast inside my soul.

Follow along let me show you what I see, yeah.
You are the one with the key around your neck.
Follow along if you can just keep quiet.
You are the one.
Will you save the world tonight?
Follow along let me show you what I see, yeah.
You are the one with the key around your neck.
Follow along if you can just keep quiet.
You are the one.
Will you save the world tonight?

She's alone and unaware.
Vision blurred and idle hands transforming any dream to sand.
The other me takes the pair.

Tell me how would you feel without a soul?
Would it be a game?
You wouldn't feel the same.
I've lost, I've lost all self control.
Wolves don't know what a beast is,
What a beast is.
Wolves don't know what a beast is.
