Morbid dreams
Drawings of mystic nights
Creating powerful realms
Where I am king
Flying with my wings
Above the burning fields
Enlighten by the flames and the moon!

Flying towards the sky
Embraced by the clouds
Seduced by the anger of the winds
I taste the victory of all times!

Thrown the stone
The weapon of a star
Deadly and cold
Will smash your weakest heart!

An angel brought to insanity
into the darkest pits of the world!

I fly towards the sky!
I taste the victory by my own hands!
I fly towards the sky!
I take your hand and you will die!
I burn the earth!
I bake the crops with flames!
I will find a way to become
The ultimate king!
