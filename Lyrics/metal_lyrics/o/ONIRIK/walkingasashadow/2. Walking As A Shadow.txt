The moon has risen...
The enchant of the night...
The dreadness of my spirit
Had seen its pale light!

Driven to the forest
Awaiting to hear a whisper of might
A silence in fear... The silence means fear!
Bethrothed to cruelty, the coldness, the night
The inhuman laughter, mocking the light!
Raising my arms, proudly
I entered a world of no return
Receiving the nightseed, embraced with violence...

Walking as a shadow, below the sorrow path of moonlight...
Drawn by a war call, to strife, with hate, by night!
