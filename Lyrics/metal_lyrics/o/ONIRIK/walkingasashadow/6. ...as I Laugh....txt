For the grand fall am I awaiting
Between tears and mortal wars
When the bloodred tide no more arises
With the moon, my soul will gather!

When darkness first made me gaze at the skies
I began to see the unknown stars
Which nocturnal remained
Everly in my bewitching eyes!

In pain
I am cursed to see the light denial
As a mark for my hatred
For having lost the truth of sword and magic!

I am mine now
In drifting thoughs of destruction and revenge
But sometimes in dreams not lost
For the pleasure of one last laugh!

I will kill you with my rotten heart
While the moon still sparks...
