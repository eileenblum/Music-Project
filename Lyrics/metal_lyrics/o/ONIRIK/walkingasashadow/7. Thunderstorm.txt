An enormous cloud approaches
Covering all of the sky
Rising with a violent storm
Thundering and lightning in strife...

Behold the coming of your death
Among your fellow men...
Breath for one last time
Wihle I laugh, endlessly!

The cloud is approaching
Every soul is to be shed
The fire that rises, set by the skies!
The ashes that consume you
You are falling apart
and only I will prevail!
