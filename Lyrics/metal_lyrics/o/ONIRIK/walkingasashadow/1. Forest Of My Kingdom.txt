Dripping water from the skies
that rain that dominates winter
the cold that raises the endless times
freezing blows of evil, signs!

As the mortal disappear
the forests grow pure
mysterious as the night
silent and filled with secrets...

Am I to be their spirit?
Am I to be their wolves?
The cruel beasts that
Guard their unholy caves!

As the footsteps vanish
my soul will begin to fly
my feelings are becoming raw
as my domain will everlast!
