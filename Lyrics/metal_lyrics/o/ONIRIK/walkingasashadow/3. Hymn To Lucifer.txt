Through the vast skies echoe the sounds of victory
Covered in blackness, the pure element of evil...

The sword of Lucifer raised up high to the moon
The fierce of a black dawn
The eldest strife is drawn so near!

All hail Lucifer
The prince of darkness and fear!

From within the earth
The dark, hating, angel has risen
At last the apocalypse
The fear of those unforgiven...

Burning the heavens
In the name of the throne of evil
As demons in laughter
Rejoycing with this cruel cleansing!

Taste your own blood
The cast of a demon
Fear not the end...
You are bound to suffer eternally!
Crave for the night
Wandering in a thousand years...
The moon has returned
As the mighty Lucifer wished!
