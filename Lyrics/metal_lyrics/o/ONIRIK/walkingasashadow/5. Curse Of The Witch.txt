Scent the curse upon your heart
Free the anger laid inside!
Watch the burning of the winds
With her flaming eyes!

Your are cursed for eternity
No longer the witch is dead
Observe her mighty powers
As you fall in pain to the end!

In crimson bloody skies
Await your painfull death
The witch has burnt your eyes
So you shall soon be dead!

Your are cursed for eternity
No longer the witch is dead
Observe her mighty powers
As you fall in pain to the end!
