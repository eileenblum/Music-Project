Forever
The scent of darkness present
The bewitching light of the moon engraves me...

Forever
The cries of the dead grow strong within me
The tyrant!

My heard has died long ago...

Forever
I will face the coldness of the earth
In secrecy, unlighten...

Forever
I will wonder through the depths of the earth
In vengeance...

In the mist my soul will rule!
