My hands holds a Chalice,
A Chalice filled with Poison
Why have I drank from it,
And not yet died?

Joining now with the Hordes of Hell,
Touched by the flames
and winged as Lucifer!
Forever unleashed
and armed againts the traitors
Ridding the Thunders of Vengeance!

I will ride to Hell tonight
and will eternally curse you!
