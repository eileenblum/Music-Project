My Blood is running
through my arms,
It reaches the ground and burns...
All the tragedy is gone
and only death remains!

I shall lie in these ashes,
Bleeding my life with my blood
Slowly descending through
dark and cold Chamers!

I wish I would hear 
their ghostly voices,
Of the murdered ones,
Upon whom we feasted
To whom we stole the Souls!

There is nothing here
left for me but death!

I shall lie in these ashes 
Bleeding my life with my blood...
Slowly descending
through dark and cold Chambers!

My Blood is almost gone in the ashes!
The Coldness grows in my Soul!
