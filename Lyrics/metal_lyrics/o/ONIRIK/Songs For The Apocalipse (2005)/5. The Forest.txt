The Forest is growing Darker,
Darken as my Soul!
The feeling that rises
has an immense Power,
A Power of Hate
never felt before!

Once I have entered,
I will never return!
Enraged by Evil,
forgotten by the world!

Forever locked in this Forest,
I seek for flesh and blood
Yet I seem not to be aging,
I have come to believe
that I am Eternal!

The Forest is growing Darker,
Darken as my Soul!
The feeling that rises
has an immense Power,
A Power of Hate
never felt before!
