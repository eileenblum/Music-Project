Below the Moon we stand,
With blades and shields and armours!
We will march until the day of our Deaths,
We are the Hordes that Hail to Fire!

The drums are sounding again and again!
The Chantings will inspire
the rage of our Blades!
The Flags of Hell are drawn in Hate!
They will unleash us
towards the Fields of War!

During the Battle we will slain and feed!
Cursing and fighting
for in darkness we believe!

The drums are sounding again and again!
The Chantings will inspire
the rage of our Blades!
The Flags of Hell are drawn in Hate!
They will unleash us
towards the Fields of War!

We are Thy Hounds from Hell!
The Creatures of my Dreams,
Inspired by the Vengeance of Lucifer
In Darkness we shall bleed!
