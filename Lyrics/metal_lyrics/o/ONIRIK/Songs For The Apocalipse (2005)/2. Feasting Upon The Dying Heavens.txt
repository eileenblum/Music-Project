Demons,
over flown the skies!
Spears,
crossed over the angels hearts!
Signals,
the Eternity is Dark!
Evil,
will again rule over the clouds!

Never the sun shone red,
Nor the blood dripped
from such heights!
Heaven is eternally dead!
A Black Dawn
for Lucifer's delight!

Never the angels fled,
With such fear of a hedious strife!
When revenge seems
to wound them in fury,
Pronouncing the End of all light!

The sight of a battle drawn in heaven
Has reached the eyes of all mankind
The Evil Ones will now sing in Hatred
And the weaker ones will Die!

And I gazed all,
all of this from my Castle
Drinking and Mocking
with my Hordes
The Feast of a War with the angels
Was long before foretold!
