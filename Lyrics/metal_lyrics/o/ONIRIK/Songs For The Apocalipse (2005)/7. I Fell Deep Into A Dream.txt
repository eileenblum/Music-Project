The Night just fell,
the Moon shines brighter,
The Darkness caressed
by this pale enlightening...
My heart feels the Coldness
and like a stone it becomes,
As I seek to be Eternal,
as I seek to be The One!

The Desire of Winter,
for many years to come,
Lost in a path of Rebellion
awaiting for the Storms!

I fall deep into a dream...

The dreams of Hatred
take my Soul,
They take me to my Throne!
They show me lands
covered Darkness
And Flames higher than the Moon!

The Desire of Winter
for many years to come,
Lost in a path of Rebellion,
awaiting for the Storms!

I fall deep into a dream...
