The Feeble have seen me pass,
I touched their heart and soul,
They were crying
as looked into their eyes
They knew eternity is  Cruel!

I was the ruin of all man,
I destroyed all light and hope,
I watched them perish in pain
I brought the world
to endless Darkness!

An Evil Force spread,
through the lands,
As my wings
covered them all!
I raged them fire,
I burnt their quest,
I fed my Empire
with their flesh!

I was te ruin of all man,
I destroyed all light
and hope,
I watched them
perish in pain,
I brought the world
to endless Darkness!
