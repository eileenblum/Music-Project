All this misery at my sight
Why keep this inside of me
The force of darkness by my side
This army I fought to be

All this evil I seem to bring
Knows no regret
Knows no boundaries for darkness
Knows neither fear nor shame

Almighty glory for my only self
The spectator of all this madness
The intriguing sword that harvest
The reaper of souls devours

All this evil I seem to bring
Knows no regret

Come forth
And let me possess you
Deliver blood
And I will caress you

All this misery at my sight
Why keep this inside of me
The force of darkness by my side
This army I fought to be
