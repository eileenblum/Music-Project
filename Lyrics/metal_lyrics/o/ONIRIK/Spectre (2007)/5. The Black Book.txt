The temptation of disease
Has turned the line of time
The black magic of those beliefs
Made me the bringer of sorrow

No longer will humanity see
The pleasures that lie beyond
Now they will only serve me
And those I have chosen

The book that rekons the pat lives
Shall be never again seen
I will make my own history
About souls to redeem

The temptation of disease
Has turned the line of time
The black magic of those beliefs
Made me the bringer of destruction
