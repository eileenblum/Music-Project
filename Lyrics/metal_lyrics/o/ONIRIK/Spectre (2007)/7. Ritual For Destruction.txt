The ritual that calls for wolves that shatter
Was summoned from that mountain top
In the name of darkness
And with an unholy dagger
In secret blood was shed

Stronger than ever
The fiends of hell returned
To disgrace the laughter
Of those humans born

For tasteful blood they are after
For human cunts as well
As a striking lightning
They shall take your soul away

Take your soul away

Stronger than ever
The fiends of hell returned
To disgrace the laughter
Of those humans born

All is here
In the tale of these monsters
Which I summoned again
To fulfill my longings
