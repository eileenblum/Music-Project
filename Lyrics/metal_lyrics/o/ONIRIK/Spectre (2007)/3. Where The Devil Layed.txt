Those eyes
Iâve seen them somewhere
Amidst my dreams
Where the devil layed

Darkness shone between them
As they lured me to hell
I sented the mist while singing
With my heart in decay

Forever closed in doors of steel
The ones that divide the earth
Itâs surface cold as the winter
With those eyes becoming mine

That fire. Iâve seen it before
It burnt my skin so it became black
And the wings have grown
As a demon I was to rule

Forever closed in doors of steel
The ones that divide the earth
Itâs surface cold as the winter
With those eyes becoming mine
