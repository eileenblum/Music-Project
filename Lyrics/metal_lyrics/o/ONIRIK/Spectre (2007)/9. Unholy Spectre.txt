Engraved and rotting
My evil self!
Demonified by judges
While my damnation takes place

Ghostly shadows in front of me
Whisper voices of desecration
Their eyes shine
Their hearts are deadâ¦as I am

I have become like them

I now belong in hell
The long awaited travel
Cursed for all there is
In lust that surrounds me

Ghostly shadows in front of me
Whisper voices of desecration
Their eyes shine
Their hearts are dead

I have become like them?
