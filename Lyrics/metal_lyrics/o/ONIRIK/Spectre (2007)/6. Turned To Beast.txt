No regrets for all I encountered
Endless pain caused my descent
With these merciless desires
I caused misery in darkness

Will this will by my side
I came upon early revenge
I was wise but still these dark nights
Took me to a world of deceit

I did not cross the boundaries sane
Nor I did search for enlightment
I was to be raised in hell
In all the glory one may desire

Will this will by my side
I came upon early revenge
I was wise but still these dark nights
Took me to a world of deceit

I now recall my ancient past
As a time of minor ends
Now as Beasts I can taste
The cruel feeling of being Master
