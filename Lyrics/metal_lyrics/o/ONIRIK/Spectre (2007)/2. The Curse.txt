There are signs
That foretell
The falling sanctity of life
The skies cover as a veil
The destruction of mankind

I will cast upon you death
If I decide to take you down

Weapons have risen
Pointed at your heart
No one will see you fall
As my scenario is blind
And your begging will deny

I will cast upon you death
If I decide to take you down

Sing to all of those you know
That your soul will disappear
That I will return to bear my curse
To make you all die in secret
