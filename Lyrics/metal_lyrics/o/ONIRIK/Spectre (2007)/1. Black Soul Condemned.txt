Black Soul Condemned

Once I was lost in that forest
I grew stronger
My soul has no fear
I became powerful as a demon

Long despair forgotten
I am at one with him
I am the fury of my ancestors
Witch felt betrayed at the beginning

I now can loose my wings
And sweep the lands
I can wish that my accomplishments
So as far as I can live

I am condemned
