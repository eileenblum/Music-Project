Storms and shadows
Delight of the infidels
This sudden rain of acid
Brings upon Lucifer the Great
I shall lift upon his flag
My strength and honour through Chaos
I will terminate their lives
And eternally bow to darknessâmentor

I am eternal with no regrets
Iâve chosen the glory of the infidel
I cast my curse on earth
I will pledge to the unholy realm

Storms and shadows
Delight of the infidels
This sudden rain of acid
Brings upon Lucifer the Great
I shall lift upon his flag
My strength and honour through Chaos
I will terminate their lives
And eternally bow to darknessâmentor

Glory of Lucifer
Bring forth the weapons of Chaos
I will follow you through the Universe
Endeavoured with such greatness
