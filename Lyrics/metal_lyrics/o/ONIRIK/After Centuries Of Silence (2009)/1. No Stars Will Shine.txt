Darkly trusted wish for blood, thrives in my old burnt soul! Emotions leave towards the vague,
the cast of a dying world... Once, there were stars that shone, but their light seemed to fade...
A night to become, as endless as I am! Welcome a dark and shallow Universe! Become the Fury,
Become the hate! Kneel before the rain that washes you, from the face of the earth!
Brought by delightful blades, red of blood by reaping corpses, prediction of such horrid dreams,
Where now will forever reign my hauntings! Once, there were stars that shone,
but their light seemed to fade... A night to become, as endless as I am!
Let my guidance strike the beels of fate!
Once there was nature and it's breed. Now one force is made to fear!
Not your god and his weak preachings, but survival in it's splendor!
