One King once stood upon another King, and cut his head off! His cloack was Black, His wings were sour,
He raised his swords to the skies, and cried for war between Gods! The becoming of a God and
his honour was true, His treachery was supported by the gaze of the Moon! All hail the new fallen God!
Bow to the Dark Lord and listen to His Speech! Let the Demon enchant you and bring you to
His Sphere! Before a winter of flames that consumes your existence! Now all the fires will grow uncessantly!
The becoming of a God and his Honour was true, His treachery was supported by the gaze of the Moon!
One King once stood upon another King, and cut his head off! His cloack was black, His wings were sour,
He raised his swords to the skies, and cried for war between Gods ! From Hell with the scent of Victory,
rose the demon with His Kind... An army strong and willing, that was meant to dethrone God!
