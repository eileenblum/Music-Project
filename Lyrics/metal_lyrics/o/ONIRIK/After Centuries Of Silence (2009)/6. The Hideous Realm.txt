Alone, amongst my possessions, I deem the odour of departed souls... Vannished in my hands,
victims of my misery... And now, the history tells I'm old... Condemned, breathing this sore
doom... I will never resent the Spirits I have made forever my own...
The occult shrine bears my Altar, with my wings I cover it all, Come and sing my darkest hymn
and leave my legacy untouched! The candles burn, they do not seem to end, showing me my dark past,
showing me my fate... I deserved what I've reached for, for now I am immense!
Long lost, the existence of them all, they were dead... By the rivers sounded bloodful battles,
the termination of the world!
Never asleep and eternaly cursing, the extinction turned them into black candles burning...
In halls of despair, the occult legends dance, iluminating from below my hideous Realm...
