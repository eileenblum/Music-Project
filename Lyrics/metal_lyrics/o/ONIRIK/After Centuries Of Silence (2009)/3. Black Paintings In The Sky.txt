Illusions that melt within the clouds, these black and white paintings covering the whole of the sky,
that the lonesome years would dictate... My thoughs were burning alive, in the sickness of my name,
there were no more souls to guide... An obscure and grimm mistery, bathes my life in blood!
A life that becomes this shadowed belief, a belief in Lucifer, the curse below my dreams!
Illusions that melt within the clouds, these Black and white paintings covering the whole of the sky,
that the lonesome years would dictate... Something told me I was to be the Last, the last to breath
and able to see... A witness to the Dark Lord's ascension, a server of Hell in his primal essence!
An obscure yet grimm mistery, bathes my life in blood! A life that becomes this shadowed belief,
a belief in Lucifer, through cursed and wicked dreams!
