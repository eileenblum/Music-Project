A storm arrives the forest, it looks as though it speaks, bearing my name under its tongue of light,
it has come to take me... This storm of fury has made me gaze and realize where lies my fate...
I hear what this voice whispers and I will follow it to the end of the earth!
Marching towards this mortifying throne, with the hand of the devil guiding my own!
Blend within these fields of War, I will ride as older Shadows so have done!
Blasphemy! The swords of Hell are drawn again! Unleash such occult powers now, the ones that
burn below my skin, use my hand to strife the heavens down! We'll chase the angels into the Abyss!
A storm arrives the forest, it looks as though it speaks, bearing my name under its tongue of light,
it has come to take me... This storm of fury has made me gaze and realize where lies my fate...
I will hear what this voice whispers, and I will follow it to the end of the earth!
