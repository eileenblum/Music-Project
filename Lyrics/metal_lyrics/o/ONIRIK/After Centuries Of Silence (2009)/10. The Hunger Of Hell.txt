Cruel feelings bear my honour, reveal the stigma of my fortune... Bring upon my unholy followers,
and let them drown beneath my wounds... Be still and listen to the choirs, they sing about the Hell
that burns, they recall the wings that covered the earth in this darkened veil... In here lie all the souls!
Walk with the dagger closely, to the sacrificed of the black mass!
Dictate the profane words and let the flames grow higher! In here lie all the souls!
Bound to eternity, I wither in dreams, as the dark ceremonies will begin!
To please the hunger of Hell many more will succumb, throughout the centuries, We will gather all of them!
