My funeral rites enhanced by ravens singing... These spells will mark the rise of a doom in Hell...
A soul cast from below the fog that will leave the earth burning, will lead a war of faith in the dark Lord!
Summoning warfare, beyond the truth that lies! Beyond the death that took me to the grave!
At last I descend...
Laying down I can still see them, the ones that made my hate grow infinite, but I swear on god's
death that I will return, after all this time that passed! Returning to bury you all in my Hell!
The blood will run throughout the lands, embodied of flesh and remains of dead bodies,
My curse will sound like Hell's horns astray, as Lucifer leads the Apocalipse!
Summoning the Beast, to whom I dedicated my past! This devotion that would let loose this void
of this unearthly challenge! Beyond the truth that lies! Beyond the death which took me to the grave!
