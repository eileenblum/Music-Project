Whispers of the moon ignite my fury, for we drink from the same blooded chalice! Let us blend the
wisdom of the visions and listen to the wind growing faster!
Occult fiends that rid the Earth prepare the soil for extinction, swallow them from the shallow pit,
hear their voices in contempt! Unite under the flag of the black Hell!
We greet the Lord of Darkness, and raise our chants in much higher bliss, we cut our flesh in
deepest gratitude, we hail the rise of our beloved Master!
Whispers of the moon ignite my furies, for we drink from the same blooded chalice, let us blend the
wisdom of the visions and listen to the wind growing faster!
The ceremony will be blessed with pain, by the unholy lush of fire, the candles burn beneath the heavens,
as we invoke the vengeance of our fathers!
Occult fiends that rid the Earth prepare the soil for extinction,
swallow them from the shallow pit, hear their voices in contempt!
