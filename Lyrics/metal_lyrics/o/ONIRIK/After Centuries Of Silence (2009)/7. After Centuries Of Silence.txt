Demons hear my call! Stingers of Hell, return! Gather below the Moon, allow the time that has begun,
to fight the fearfull, to fight the weak... All these centuries in silence... we were...
Bemaster my theory, at last we will rule, join forces among you, be all set to kill, we will fly above them
and with our swords will slain, their hearts we will tear, their souls we will take... The darkness will grow!
Sharpened teeth, the hounds with swords are set to hunt, bethroned with the force of steel and fire
they rise from below... Behold which truth lies ahead, we will bring destruction! We will bring destruction!
Bemaster my theory, at last we will rule, join forces among you, be all set to kill, we will fly above them
and with our swords will slain, their hearts we will tear, their souls we will take... For the darkness will grow!
