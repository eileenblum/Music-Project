Oh Chants make hear my Splendor, as witches become my whores! To the Devil with the Horns,
bring forth worthy servants, bleed to me your souls! Share with me your hearts!
Bring forth the great honours of this Feast, the proud army of Hell awaits, let all see what the Devil brings
to his legion and its faith! Bastard son of God, see what your cries have brought to me,
see the vengeance which you fear become alive, drown alone in whirlwinds of Demoncy!
The ritual has commenced, the blood will now start to flow, the chantings unleashed by the throats of Hell,
will bring upon the almighty lord! Oh Chants make hear my splendor, as witches become my whores!
To the Devil with the Horns, bring forth worthy servants, bleed to me your souls, share with me your hearts!
An orgy between demon and man will sound from the woods forlorn, with the flames
reflecting the pain of the servant's souls being devoured!
