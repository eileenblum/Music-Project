Take a walk on the why side,
a fast ride, through anarchistic eyes
Take a look at the real world,
the wheels turn, on sugar-coated lies
Reality is a fist fuck,
a kiss first, a rat infested ride
Last laugh on the last laugh,
who laughs last, before the well runs dry

Take a look at the real world
Take a look at the real world

Waking up to the rat race,
the fast pace, consumer friendly smiles
Everything at the right price,
for each vice, 1-800 DIAL
Serving only to please you,
appease you, remedy the void
Obsessed with the obscene,
enough green, whatever gets you high

Take a look at the real world
Take a look at the real world

Fight the norm, fuck the rules
Feed the brain, fight the fools
Burn the book, ban the bomb
Fight the right, right the wrong
All the sticks, all the stones
All the clowns, all the clones
All the blood, all the bones,
Food for your brain

I pledge allegiance to no flag,
a blood rag, on every body bag
I'm not wearing a price tag,
a toe tag, for anybody's rag
I bow down to no man,
no bigger plan, no predetermined programme
Mine is my own load,
my own road, my way is what I am

Take a look at the real world
Take a look at the real world

Fight the norm, fuck the rules
Feed the brain, fight the fools
Burn the book, ban the bomb
Fight the right, right the wrong
All the sticks, all the stones
All the clowns, all the clones
All the blood, all the bones,
Food for your brain
