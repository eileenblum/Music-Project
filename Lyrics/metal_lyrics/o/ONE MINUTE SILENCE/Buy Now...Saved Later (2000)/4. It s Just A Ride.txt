I wanna hear what the man with the gun has to say
when he says what he has to say
I wanna know why the man has a gun
and the gun not the man keeps the world at bay
I wanna know what the man with the plan
had in mind when he said 'what will be will be'
I wanna hear what the man has to say
what the man has to say might just save me

Watch me reel them in
Watch me reel them in

I wanna hear what the man on the street has to say
when he says what he has to say
I wanna feel what the man on the street gets to feel
when we turn and we walk away
I wanna hear what the man at the top
has to say for himself on judgement day
I wanna hear what the man has to say
what the man has to say might just save me

Watch me reel them in
Watch me reel them in

It's just a ride, ride
It's just a ride, ride
It's just a ride, ride
It's just a ride, ride

I wanna say it to you now while I can while
I am what I am while I am what I see
