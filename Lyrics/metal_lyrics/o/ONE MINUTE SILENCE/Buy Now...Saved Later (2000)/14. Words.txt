Life - They fought and fell and died and never came home
Words - For words they fought and words they fell and words alone
War - I tried to see it your way, tried to see it your way, but words fail me
Life - Above all else if nothing else, I can't see my way again, I can't see my way again

So here we are
Dawn of a new day
Fuck how it looks
Fuck yesterday
I'm not saying forget
That's not what I'm saying
That's not what I'm saying
You make me feel like I'm nothing
But that's life
Yeah, that's life
50 million
A small price for freedom
My freedom
Fuck freedom if I'm not alive to live it
I'll fight for it
I won't kill or die for it
This is a rich man's world
Let the rich man fry for it

Strange - On no man's land for no man's land how brave how grand how very dead
indeed
Hope - How many more if any more how many roads before the hand we hold is free
War - I've tried to see it your way, tried to see it your way, reasoned but with
reasoning life only echoes mine
Life - Above all else if nothing else, I can't see my way again,
I can't see my way again

So here we are
Dawn of a new day
Fuck how it looks
Fuck yesterday
I'm not saying forget
That's not what I'm saying
That's not what I'm saying
You make me feel like I'm nothing
But that's life
Yeah, that's life
50 million
A small price for freedom
My freedom
Fuck freedom if I'm not alive to live it
I'll fight for it
I won't kill or die for it
This is a rich man's world
Let the rich man fry for it

Peace - They fought and fell and died and never came home
Words - For words they fell and words they fought and words alone
I've tried to see it your way I've tried to see it your way

Words fool me
Words fail me
