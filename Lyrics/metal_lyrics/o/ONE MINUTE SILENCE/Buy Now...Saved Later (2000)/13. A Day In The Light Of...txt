I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree I crashed to the ground
I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree I'm not coming down
I can't let it be - the man on the street says
I can't let it be - we're doing fine
I can't let it be - I'm doing fine
I can't let it be - I'm doing fine
I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree crashed to the ground
I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree I'm not coming down

To read and write, not to read what's right
The difference can blind for life
Up into the light, the fight continues
I continue to fight, despite all I see
The blatant apathy, or just the illusion of it
Life sure knows how to pack a punch
The Bundys - not the Brady Bunch next door
X-rated hardcore step up take the floor
Tell me what you see
Mysterious ways just doesn't do it for me

I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree I crashed to the ground
I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree I'm not coming down
I can't let it be - the man on the street says
I can't let it be - we're doing fine
I can't let it be - I'm doing fine
I can't let it be - I'm doing fine
I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree crashed to the ground
I climbed up a tree to see if I could get to you
I climbed up a tree I'm not coming down

To fight for life, not to fight for life
The wrong road can lead to Christ
A day in the life of, in spite of
Those who have turned the lights off
To write me up as a write off
Wrong move - Wrong move
To write me up as a write off - Wrong move

As good as it gets
Get used to it
Nobody's coming for you
Who's coming for me? Guess

As good as it gets
Get used to it
Nobody's coming for you
Who's coming for me? Guess
