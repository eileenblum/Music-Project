If I can change one, I can change two
If I can change two, I can change four
If I can change four, I can change eight
If I can change eight, I can change

With that in mind
With that in mind
With that in mind
With that in mind

You're gonna wake up some day and find my words in your mouth
Inconceivable? At least hear me out
Right from wrong, wrong from right, when in doubt
Walk up to the man in the mirror and ask him
I wake up take a shit grab my shit and leave
A warm day but a cold world, so I freeze
Well surprise surprise no surprises up its sleeve
One day at a time like the rest of you
What if I wake up someday and I find myself singing your song
If I wake up with you in my face screaming 'wrong'

If I wake up with you in my face screaming 'wrong'
I will land again on my feet
If I wake up with you in my face screaming 'wrong'
I will land again on my feet

You're gonna wake up someday and be and see that light
Unconventional means take a bite
The fast train south burns twice as bright
Jump on at the next stop and hold on for dear life
I wake up take no shit talk some shit that's me
A warm heart but with cold words what I see
No authority on life but I see what I see
And forgive me but I only do reality

What if I wake up someday and I find myself singing your song
If I wake up with you in my face screaming 'wrong'

If I wake up with you in my face screaming 'wrong'
I will land again on my feet
If I wake up with you in my face screaming 'wrong'
I will land again on my feet
