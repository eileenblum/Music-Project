210 dog years, still alive, still here, no religion, no flag, no fear, slip into fifth gear
and move, those who would disapprove can suck my dick, say sorry?
Like fuck am I, those who wish to see me dead can die, the self righteous, step up
and I might just see you saved, remember my face when you go to the grave,
fuck you, every last one of you, from the top down to the bottom, and that includes

My god is awake, my god is alive,
My god is awake, my god has arrived
My god is awake, my god is alive,
My god is awake, my god has arrived
