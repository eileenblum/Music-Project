One man with all the money
No bee takes all the honey
A black hat and a white bunny
Same as yesterday
One way and no way back
One green bottle left to crack
Still we walk the beaten track
Same as yesterday
Same as yesterday

Ahh, shit
Another fool with a quick fix
The right remedy
Everybody's selling me
Selling me telling me
Religion or to hell with me
Come on everybody let's go party with the enemy
Come at me come at me
Suckers will never be
Come on everybody keep the party in front of me
Come at me come at me
Suckers will never see
Come on everybody be yourself or you'll never be

One god and mine if any
One war is one too many
What to do what to say
Same as yesterday
One way or no one wins
One god for all our sins
Today is all tomorrow brings
Same as yesterday
Same as yesterday

Ahh, shit
Another fool with a quick fix
The right remedy
Everybody's selling me
Selling me telling me
Religion or to hell with me
Come on everybody let's go party with the enemy
Come at me come at me
Suckers will never be
Come on everybody keep the party in front of me Come at me come at me
Suckers will never see
Come on everybody be yourself or you'll never be
