Black Jesus, white Jesus, Jesus where do I begin?
sons of former slaves, former slave owner's, at the table king,
Fomer cave owner's, gene donors, that's my thing,
baa baa black sheep, what I can, cannot sing.
How did it ever get to this, vicious circle, circus ring,
circumstance has me defending my skin,
on ice where the ice is thin.
What have we become, why have we become numb?
colour just a cover, uncover, discover within.

Stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
peace is our policy, for peace we're bound!

Stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
peace is our policy, for peace we're bound!

Black Jesus, white Jesus, Jesus when do you step in?
sons of fomer slaves, voters, home owner's,
at their tables, King.
On their cables, TV screens, cam captured everything.
All across the globe shocked, racial tensions rocked,
April 29. 92 white jury hits the spot,
black fury loaded, exploded like a gun shot,
left a message that must never be forgot,
for a front seat on the bus, how high the cost?
Bellies turned, cities burned,
anger justified, vindicated why, indignation, pride,
constitution lied, someone's gotta pay, fifty eight die.
Two wrongs, no light, case of black against the wall,
and I ain't going down without a fight.

Stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
peace is our policy, for peace we're bound!

Stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
stay back, stay back, stay down,
peace is our policy, for peace we're bound!
