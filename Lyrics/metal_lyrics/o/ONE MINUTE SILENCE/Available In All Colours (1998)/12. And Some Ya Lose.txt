And suddenly boom, straight from your mamma's womb,
just another fuck, no one gives a fuck, doom,
just another brick, just another fool,
just another sucker for the sucker school.
Destined to lose, time to choose.
Not gonna like it but it has to be said,
one day your nobody, next day your nobody dead,

Dead!
dead!
dead!

This is not about you.
So do what ya gotta do, no one gives a damn,
system doesn't give a damn about you,
systematically designed to blind,
denied the right to operate, as an independent mind,
all decisions based on the number of fingers that point.
Point I'm trying to make is that,
black and white, bottom line, let me speak my mind, freak your mind,
reach inside and wipe that smile,
ya come and get it sucker, cruel to be kind.
Not gonna like it, but it has to be said,
one day your nobody, next day your nobody dead,

Dead!
Dead!
Dead!

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it,
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it,
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it,
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it,

And some ya lose, and some ya lose
And some ya lose, and some ya lose
And some ya lose, and some ya lose
And some ya lose, and some ya lose

this is not about you, this is not about you!
this is not about you, this is not about you!

And suddenly boom, straight from your mamma's womb,
just another fuck, no one gives a fuck, doom,
just another brick, just another fool,
just another sucker for the sucker school.
Destined to lose, time to choose.
Not gonna like it but it has to be said,
one day your nobody, next day your nobody Dead
