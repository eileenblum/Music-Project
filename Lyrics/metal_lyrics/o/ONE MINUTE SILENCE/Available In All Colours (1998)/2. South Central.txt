Jump, jump, jump!
I'm gonna bring it down
jump, jump, jump!
I'm gonna bring it down
jump, jump, jump!
I'm gonna bring it down
jump, jump, jump!
I'm gonna bring it down

Bring it down,
bring it down for you!
bring it down,
bring it down for you!
bring it down,
bring it down for you!
bring it down,
bring it down for you!

Once again I man the mic, I take a bite,
maybe more than I can chew, but thats the price.
Gonna exercice a fundamental right,
opinion, say what I like.
Say what you will, but think twice,
not a black thing, a black choice,
four hundred years, there's no denial,
why must every white man stand trial?

Outspoken!
You bet your life,
ain't gonna take
what you won't take from whites!

I don't wanna die, never wanna die,
I don't wanna die, never wanna die.

Its a long long way to Tipperary,
South Central, Tippera---ry,
long long way to Tipperary,
South Central, Tippa, Tippa, Tippa.
I will not I cannot, I will not I won't,
South Central!
I will not I cannot, I will not, I won't.
I will not I cannot, I will not, I won't,
South Central!
I will not I cannot, I will not, I won't.

Here I go again, put pen to page,
the fat lady soon to take the stage,
oppression, not just a black page, a white plague,
impressions I get from the black's rage.
So many Jews, with too few saved,
learn from the tools, fools, in God's name,
learn where to look, and who to blame,
insanity best decribes the frame.

Outspoken!
You bet your life,
ain't gonna take
what you won't take from whites.

I don't wanna die, never wanna die,
I don't wanna die, never wanna die.

Its a long long way to Tipperary,
South Central, Tippera---ry.
long long way to Tipperary,
South Central, Tippa, Tippa, Tippa.

Ya wanna fuck me, momma?
Well, heh, ya fuckin punk!
South Central!
Fuck me momma
Check-check check this you cunt!

Fuck me, momma?
Well, hah, ya fuckin punk!
South Central!
Fuck me momma
Check-check check this you punk!

I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't.
I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't,
I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't,
I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't,

I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't,
I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't,
I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't,
I will not, I cannot, I will not, I won't!

South Central!
South Central!

Time to fix what's broken, this road leads to hell.
I chose not my colour, underneath this shell.

Outspoken!
You bet your life,
ain't gonna take
what you won't take from whites.

I don't think so,
I don't think so,
I don't think so!
