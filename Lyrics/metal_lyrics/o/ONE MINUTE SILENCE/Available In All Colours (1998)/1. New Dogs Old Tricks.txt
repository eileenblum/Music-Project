You got thirty minutes to clear the fuckin' area!

Boom bang, shit flew, brains too
life removed, leaders unmoved,
Provo's prove, once again,
the needs outweigh the few,
the means outweighed the crew,
one thousand pounds, laid by two.
Black the scene, the gold,
the white the green.
Lowered the flag for a dream,
but in some eyes a gleam,
their ways extreme,
of the crop, the cream,
but in this hour sour,
five felt the power of it,
one a child of six, fast I need a fix,
change the channel please.

Somebody's screaming freedom,
somebody's screaming pride,
somebody's screaming never,
me I'm screaming why.

Somebody's screaming freedom,
somebody's screaming pride,
somebody's screaming never,
me I'm screaming why.

One more, now two, now three,
lone gun man takes revenge,
three more shot down for what,
and here we go again,
for what, for pride,
for freedom once denied,
try centuries of misery,
now fucked is how it's best described,
no more, no never again,
but here we go again,
Provo's on the move again,
people gonna lose again,
people gonna lose again,
people gonna lose again,
people gonna lose again,
people gonna lose again.

Somebody's screaming freedom,
somebody's screaming pride,
somebody's screaming never,
me I'm screaming why.

Somebody's screaming freedom,
somebody's screaming pride,
somebody's screaming never,
me I'm screaming why.

Who the fuck are you?
who the fuck are you?
comin at me, pointing your finger at me,
check your history!
Here I go again, step the fuck back,
nick nack Paddy with the facts,
give the dog a bone, to the bone green,
On the mic, i'm the man, with the plan,
say, who the fuck are you,
who the fuck are you?

Somebody's screaming freedom,
somebody's screaming pride,
Somebody's screaming never,
me I'm screaming why.

Somebody's screaming freedom,
somebody's screaming pride,
somebody's screaming never,
me I'm screaming why.

Somebody's screaming freedom!
Somebody's screaming freedom
