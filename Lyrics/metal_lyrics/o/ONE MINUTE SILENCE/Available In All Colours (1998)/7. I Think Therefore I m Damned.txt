I am, I am, I am, I am,
I am not supposed to see what I see,
you are not supposed to turn your eyes,
I cannot believe I see what i see,
a bigger fool I guess to question why.

It is not somebody else's problem,
it is not somebody else's fight,
I am not responsible for you fool,
I am not responsible for your plight.

Society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
society, you're gonna see what you deserve,
society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
just because I can and have the nerve.

I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise, no.

No!
No!
No!

I am, I am, I am, I am,
I am not supposed to feel like I feel,
and its not that I don't when I can,
some days I want to be the shepard,
and there's days when I don't give a damn.

I am not supposed to see what I see,
every moment spent is stuck on why,
I cannot sit back and make the most of it,
a bigger fool I guess to even try.

Society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
society, you're gonna get what you deserve,
society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
just because I can and have the nerve.

I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise, no.

No!
No!
No!

No, No, No, No,
No, No, No, No!
