Choice, so I've chosen to choose, not to forgive,
forget, respect I refuse, accept life as it is and lose,
turn the other cheek and have them both bruised.
No chance, no thanks, no way; this blood is old school,
a spanner if any tool, put away your brain fool.
Enough is enough, I've had it up,
took the rough with the rough, so shut the fuck up,
pull it down, rip it up, step back to step up, wise up, wise up.

Above none, none above me,
how it should man, but will never be,
don't you talk to me about equality,
never has man, never will be.
Above none, none above me,
above none, none above me.
Above none, none above me,
above none, none above,

What about,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop,

Understand black, understand white, look deeper,
colour's not an insight. Ignorance has staged the wrong fight,
time to shed, spread a little light.
Read between the times, history is a dark light.
Past fires still burn bright, forgive, never forget,
chain, bucket, water, take the first step.
Wisdom is a wise bet, Jesus give me back my net,
forgive, never forget.

Above none, none above me,
how it should man, but will never be,
don't you talk to me about equality,
never has man, never will be.
Above none, none above me,
above none, none above me.
Above none, none above me,
above none, none above,

What about,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop,
pig until proven copper, yeah, pig until proven cop, 

Pig!
Pig!
Pig!
Pig!
Pig!
Pig!
Pig!
Pig!

Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,

Yeah, yeah ha-ha

Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,

Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,
Above none, none above me,

[Continued for a long time]

Stick it up your fucking ass you pig bastard!
