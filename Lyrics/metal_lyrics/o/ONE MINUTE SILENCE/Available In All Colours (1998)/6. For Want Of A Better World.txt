Step.

Step back, step away,
kindly stay the fuck away from me,
what I am is what I am.
Let me live as I please, more than just a name,
number, pawn, puppet, fuck it.
I'm a man, person, look, see, closer please, touch, feel,
flesh, yes real, like you I bleed, I hurt, I touch, I fuck, I need.
I possess what you need, individuality, often heard of, rarely seen.
Let me come clean.

You can't take this away from me,
You can't take this away from me,
You can't take this away from me,
You can't take this away!

Step back, keep away, keep yourself to yourself
your opinion on a shelf, your presence isn't welcome, but felt,
Never tasted life, just smelt. Folded rather than gamble,
Deal with what was dealt. Bitterness felt.

Sucked into a circle of fools and tools and rules.
Wanting all to conform to the norm and lose.
Submit to fit, fuck that, suck this.
Complacement like pigs in shit. Waist high and you still sit.

You can't take this away from me,
You can't take this away from me,
You can't take this away from me,
You can't take this away!

You!
You!
You!
You!

Wide awake, I'm a step ahead of all of you.
I cannot understand your narrow minded attitude.
Step beside me, stand beside me fool.
You'll always be a number,
always be another tool.
Not me, not me, not me, not this boy.
Never gonna bend, never gonna comply.
Not me, not me, not me, not this boy.
Step right down to this.

Know, know that you are nobody, nobody, nothing to me.
Brother, my ass, not fit to be, and never will be.
Love thy sister, brother.
Respect for one another.
Nice dream, but where have you been?
Another planet it would seem.
Come back down to earth, let me show you what I've seen.
I hurt, I touch, I fuck, I need.

I possess what you need,
I possess what you need,
I possess what you need,
I possess what you need,
I possess what you need!

You can't take this away from me,
you can't take this away from me,
You can't take this away from me,
you can't take this away from me.

You can't take this away from me,
you can't take this away from me.
You can't take this away from me,
you can't take this away!
I Think Therefore I'm Damned
I am, I am, I am, I am,
I am not supposed to see what I see,
you are not supposed to turn your eyes,
I cannot believe I see what i see,
a bigger fool I guess to question why.

It is not somebody else's problem,
it is not somebody else's fight,
I am not responsible for you fool,
I am not responsible for your plight.

Society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
society, you're gonna see what you deserve,
society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
just because I can and have the nerve.

I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise, no.

No!
No!
No!

I am, I am, I am, I am,
I am not supposed to feel like I feel,
and its not that I don't when I can,
some days I want to be the shepherd,
and there's days when I don't give a damn.

I am not supposed to see what I see,
every moment spent is stuck on why,
I cannot sit back and make the most of it,
a bigger fool I guess to even try.

Society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
society, you're gonna get what you deserve,
society, you're gonna get what's coming to ya,
just because I can and have the nerve.

I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise,
I am not prepared to compromise, no.

No!
No!
No!

No, No, No, No,
No, No, No, No!
