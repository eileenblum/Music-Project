Put up, or get up and get out,
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, put up, put up, put up, get out!

Put up, or get up and get out,
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, put up, put up, put up, get out!!! (get out!)

Listen up, give it up, as I drop hip hop some lines,
better believe in me, cause I'm your last hope, life line.
Never gonna be a party by the people for all the people,
never gonna be put to practice, all men created equal,
maybe in God's eyes, lets hope there's a sequel.
How it is, how it should be, what it's not, what it could be,
why it is and why it will always be,
greed, personal gain, let me put you in the picture,
in the right frame,
never get the ball but you're in the game,
stick your finger up your ass, feel your brain,
recommend an ennema to clear the frame,
couldn't crawl and we took a plane,
left wisdom in the ape lane, last lane, rape lane.

Put up, or get up and get out,
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, put up, put up, put up, get out!

Put up, or get up and get out,
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, put up, put up, put up, get out.

Pick a side, if not mine, piss off, don't want to hear,
no compromise when it comes to man,
man's fucking me up in here.
His ability to make it all dissapear,
how can I trust what I fear, be like the rest,
disconnect, stick my head in a beer,
that dizzy disease, disney indeed,
dangle the carrot, watch the ass feed.
Never questioning the hand that bleeds,
less brain than present day Cobain,
global destruction at the touch of a button
a world clearly insane,
genocide justified as killing in the name,
won't be satisfied till the peace keepers fly,
then it's boom, boom, boom, boom, goodbye.

Put up, or get up and get out,
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, put up, put up, put up, get out!

Put up, or get up and get out,
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, or get up and get out
ya gotta put up, put up, put up, put up!
