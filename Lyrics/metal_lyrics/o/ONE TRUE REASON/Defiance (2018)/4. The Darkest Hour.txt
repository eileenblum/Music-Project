"Raise your fists!"
Day after day he shouted to himself.
A failed attempt to get up again. In the depths of the darkest hour,
The anguish has a bitter taste.

And with the weight of the world on his back, giving up seemed the fast way back on track.
At each step, another chain link was closed, and everything collapsed again.

His asylum was only an illusion, hatred was carved into his bones.
His asylum was only an illusion, but it will remain forever within itself.

"Tie and cut, let it drain to the end."
The greater pain will never be caused by death.
The only truth that united us, now flows down the floor.
...and he still keeps asking for more.

And with the weight of the world on his back, giving up seemed the fast way back on track.
At each step, another chain link was closed, and everything collapsed again.

I try to fight these feelings, which seem to have no end...
I try to climb out of this deep holeâ¦ but everything collapse again.

I shouldn't let you in through that door,
So sweet, you came and took my soul.
I burned my dreams and swallowed it all. You never told me how painful it was,

His asylum was only an illusion, hatred was carved into his bones.
My asylum was the only solution, and I will remain within myself.
