Forcing through the days, another sleepless night.
With all this weight on my shoulders, feels like I'm buried alive.
Buried alive!

I can't see. I can't breathe.
But I can't deny, I chose a path driven by wrath.

Walked under dark clouds, waited for the storm to come.
Built a wall around myself. I never trusted no one.

Counting down the days, and sweating through the nights.
With all this weight on my shoulders, feels like I'm losing my mind.
Losing my mind!

And I will rise, every time I fall.
I'll find my way of getting through it all.

I can't see. I can't breathe.
But I can't deny, I chose a path, filled with wrath.

All or nothing, all for nothing? These questions rules my life.
All or nothing, all for nothing? The enemy is inside my mind.
