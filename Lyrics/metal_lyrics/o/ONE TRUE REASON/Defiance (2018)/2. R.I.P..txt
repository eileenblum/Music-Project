I remember the times you spent, pointing fingers here and there.
Always with the last word. Always being the most true.
"True 'til death" where it ends?

A thousand faces, you showed day after day.
Always backed up with your friends. Always liked to lead the blind.
That was how you ended.

You can't stop us. We are here to stay
Fighting back, biting back.
You are done.

Look back over the choices you made.
Picking up the pieces of the role that you played.
Now the streets are talking and the cards are dealt.
You can not comeback for this.
Rest in pain.

Out of the game, you have been forgotten.
Out of the game. No friends, no trends.
All those people that you used, are haunting down for you.

So you can not stop us. We are here to stay.
We are the resistance, keep your fucking distance.

Look back over the choices you made.
Picking up the pieces of the role that you played.
Now the streets are talking and the cards are dealt.
You can not comeback for this.
Rest in pain.

Rest in pain now.
This time, you've lost yourself in a long fall from grace
You brought this on yourself. That's how you are ended.
