Dark times.
Surrounded by hatred. Living on the edge of fear, doubting everything they hear.
People blinded with national pride. Anger chasing victims by racial profile.

Gas times.
Masses turned against the oppressed. Forcing the excluded to live in distress.
Keeping people away from the fight. Exalting fascist tyrants and their display of might.

Hate is getting the best of us. Lost hopes, false dreams
All I see is empathy for no one, prejudice for all.
Disrupted misconceptions imprisoning your mind.

Hard times.
Narrow minded used as tool. Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth.
Out of control police assaults. You are judge and jury until death puts a halt.

End line.
Always blaming victims,
Logic lost on brainwashed minds.
Shielded behind doctrines of a twisted god, you play your part in the firing squad.

Hate is getting the best of us. Lost hopes, false dreams
All I see is empathy for no one and prejudice for all.
Worthless misconceptions imprisoning your mind.

Welcome to hell my dearest friend.
One way trip on this socialized hate.
