Fight back! This is all we have.
Boiling with rage, give up at nothing.
And that's what keeps us alive.
Through this dark times we shall rise.

We've been hiding for so long. Now let chaos take its course.
Take a stand, clench your fist. For those who died so we can live.

No love no mercy. They spit on human rights.
No guilt, no fear. Payback time.

Fight back! You are not alone.
Fight back! United and strong.

Survival, already transformed into an art.
Now it's time to turn it into a war
Dusk 'til dawn, back to back.
Through this dark times we shall rise.

Defiance, until words become action.
Alliance, against all form of oppression.
Side by side we stand together
Ignite all banners, set this world on fire.

We'll stop at nothing. We won't back down
Scream your heart out and fight for more.
