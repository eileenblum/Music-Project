Can't spend my life living in regret.
Many times I forgave, but I will never forget.
One round to fight, one chance of survival.
The time has come for reprisal

Taking back what's ours. Out of step, out of line.
The downfall of their lies. Day by day, one by one.

From broken homes, dead end streets
Force-fed with false ideals
We won't bow our heads, refuse to kneel.

Can't spend my life living in regret.
Many times I forgave, but I will never forget.
One round to fight, one chance of survival.
The time has come for reprisal

I won't end up in this cage
I'll bite the hand that feeds.

Losing grip on what's real. We still stand, we still feel.
We will march strong as one. There's no hide, there's no run.

Revenge will come from those who have been left behind.
It's our time, our destiny. We'll dig the grave of tyranny.

Reprisal!

The time has come. Unite as one.
