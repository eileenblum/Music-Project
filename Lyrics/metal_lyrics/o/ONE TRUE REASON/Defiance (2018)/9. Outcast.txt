Tied hard in hollow ambitions. Living on your knees, redemption is what you seek.
Clubs are full, souls are empty, so we can't feel the rope tight in our necks.

I feel surrounded by impositions. In desperate need for my own decisions.
No matter how hard this reality unfolds, I won't fall in line, I will not be controlled.

Worlds are about to collide, I choose my side, I chose my fight.
The real enemy it's out of sight, so I walk my path far from the mass.

You keep questioning all of my choices, as life passes by you in front of your eyes.
I want to live free, so I broke my chains, I found my place, a means to an end.

I feel surrounded by impositions. In desperate need for my own decisions.
No matter how hard this reality unfolds, I won't fall in line, I will not be controlled.

I won't be part of this.
I won't bend my knee.

I'll be the outcast, the stranger, the averse.
