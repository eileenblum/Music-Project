Can't lower my guard, I choose to react.
Because the traps are hidden in plain sight.
What's done is done, there's no looking back.

Can't fall behind. I'm out of my cage,
It's "sink or swim", it's "live or die".
As you grew old in age, I grew so cold in rage.

Now times are changing from bad to worse,
But I'm still the same. Still the same against this world.

'Til my dying day, 'til my final breath, against a world I don't belong.

On this life we never find peace,
Daily struggles that will never cease.
We live, we lie, we love, we die....
Striving to survive,

But I'm still defiant! And will remain defiant!
Standing through the tests of time...
Never fall in line.

The world keeps spinning, but going in reverse.
Hard times have changed me, yet I am still the same.

Live and learn, never forget of the choices and the paths we have take,
No remorse, no regret. Always two steps ahead.
