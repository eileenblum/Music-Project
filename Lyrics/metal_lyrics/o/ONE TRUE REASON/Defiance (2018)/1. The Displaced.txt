Our flag sees no colors. Will not judge by creed or race.
Our flag is black like our souls. Stained with red of those who gave their blood.

Our flag sees no colors. Will not judge by creed or race
Our flag is black like our souls. Serve no boundaries

Freedom stolen by imaginary lines.
Trapped between walls where dreams are declined.
Persecuted (executed). Lives are defined by the course of wars
Counting hours of sorrow. No escape, no tomorrow
Waiting for a new chance, a fresh start to break the chains.

Fleeing from terror, measures of despair.
Across the borders, a breath of fresh air.
Then exclusion (reclusion). Diversity breeds fear, segregation and tears.
Facing a new world while judgeful eyes increase. No justice, no peace.
Just because your eyes are still closed, it doesn't make it all gone

Displaced!

If you can't trust people with freedom, how can you trust people with power?
Mind and soul, flesh and bones. We're all the same in this forsaken world.

Our flag sees no colors. Will not judge by creed or race
Our flag is black like our souls. Serve no boundaries
