This daydream is over, your nightmare just begun.
Stay away, stay aware. Watch the doomsday come.

See the ashes falling, falling from the skies.
Our land is bleeding, bleeding inside out.

Now stop and ask yourself, "Was it worth the price?"
Corporations work for greed. Burning this world, taking what they need.
Now you may ask yourself, "Is this the end?"
Is this the end?

Payback is a bitch motherfucker!

Population's distress. Progress's march drains life out.
Step aside, no blind eyes. Watch the doomsday come.

We are the ones to blame. Leading life like there's no tomorrow.
We are mute, we are blind, we are deaf. Soon there will be nothing left.

Now stop and ask yourself, "Was it worth the price?"
Corporations, mining fields.
Ripping the earth out under dubious deals.
Now you may ask yourself, "Is this the end?"
Is this the end?

Slave labor dying of starvation. Thirst for power leading to extermination.
Cold blooded suits running the cycle of death. Watch the earth downfall on its final breath.

Bring the end! There's no turning back.
Bring the end! And no fucking cure.
