As the days have faded away,
Everything seemed to fall apart,
But we gather pieces by pieces
And now nothing can bring us down!

We made our choice of
Life and nothing or no one can change,
What makes us feel alive,
It's our conviction and how do we stand,
Facing the fact that nothing comes easy.

I know you expect us to follow their rules
But our response proves that you're such a fool
This feeling running through my veins,
An inner flame that will never fade.

There is some things are worth fighting for,
Keep the integrity of life.
Live with honor, die with pride.
Friends and family side by side.

I know you expect us to follow their rules
But our response proves that you're such a fool
This feeling running through my veins,
An inner flame that will never fade.

As the days have faded away
Everything seemed to fall apart
But we gather pieces by pieces,
Now nothing can bring us down!

Nothing can bring us down. You can't bring us down!

This phase is going to last, true reasons never fade.
Still here, piece by piece. Nothing can bring us down.
