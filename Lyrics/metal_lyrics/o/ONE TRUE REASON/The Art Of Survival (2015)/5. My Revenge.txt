Darkness has taken my soul
I feel I have no heart
My sins are leading my way
Your blood is what I seek

How did I reached to this point?
Feel like I'm running out of time
How did I get lost my path?
If the road always seemed so right

Now it's time to take back my life
I will take my revenge
It's over.

It's over. Your time has come
It's over. Your time has come

Darkness has taken my soul
I feel I have no heart
My sins are leading my way
Your blood is what I seek

Does revenge will fix my head?
For now it is what I want
Can a war replace my peace?
My choices have brought me here

Now it's time to take back my life
I will take my revenge
It's over.
