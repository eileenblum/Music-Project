I know they are testing me
To stray away from my righteous path
Knows they surrounded me
To knock me down and stab me in the back

I can see right through you
Your words carry greed and hate
I won't play the fool for you
I'm resilient and I make my stand

Weight lies on my shoulders
Temptation, damnation
I believe it to my soul, I get stronger everyday
Dedication, salvation - must be my pure faith
I believe it to my soul, I get stronger everyday

Look me in the eyes
You'll see I've no shame
I carry my cross
Will you carry yours?

Demons gather around - to see me fail, fall and break
Darkness take its turn, try their best but just can't win
You try to embrace me, but I've got my pure faith
In the dark they whisper at me
Empty promises, lust, vain.

The blood and sweat I gave
All my sins washed away
I believe it to my soul, I get stronger everyday
Dedication, salvation - must be my pure faith
I believe it to my soul, I get stronger everyday

Look me in the eyes - you'll see I've no shame
I carry my cross - will you carry yours?
