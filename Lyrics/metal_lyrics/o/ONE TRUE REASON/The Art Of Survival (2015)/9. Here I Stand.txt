I come from where the damned live.
Loyalty is not a common thing.
But I take pride for what I've seen.
It made me grow, it made me think.

There's no light, there's no hope,
You gotta pay the price and play your role.
There's no trust, there's no love.
You better make it right or else you fall.

One by one. I fight everyday. One by one.
I don't care what you say. One by one.
Your lies will fall. One by one. Now hit the ground.

I sing about the old days, where pride and glory used to reign.

The golden days are long gone, but here I stand.
I make my best with all my heart. I'll make it worth with all I've got.

One by one. I fight everyday. One by one.
I don't care what you say. One by one.
Your lies will fall. One by one. Now hit the ground.

They try to push me down, you try to stop me and you fall.
They won't take the best of me. I'm sick of feeling sorry for you.
I make my own way.
