My blood has reached its boiling point.
Our roads are close to collide.
You will never look my way,
You will never speak my name again.

No more second chances,
The pressure is down on you.

All the pain you caused.
All those days that were lost.
It's more than I can take.
Your clock is ticking away.

You intruded on my life,
Tried to take all that was mine.
You only thought about giving up
When the source dried up.
You only cared about yourself.
At some point your mask fell down.
Now you're choking on your wordsâ¦
But the worst is yet to come.

Now the damage it's done,
No one can stop your fall.
Spread your poison somewhere else.
I'll never forgive, never forget.

No more second chances,
The pressure is down on you.

Farewell my friend.
This nightmare comes to an end.
I hope to never see you again.

You intruded on my life,
Tried to take all that was mine.
You only thought about giving up
When the source dried up.
You only cared about yourself.
At some point your mask fell down.
Now you're choking on your wordsâ¦
But the worst is yet to come.
