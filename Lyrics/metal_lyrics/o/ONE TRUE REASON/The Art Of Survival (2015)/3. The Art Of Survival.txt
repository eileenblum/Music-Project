Get up, wake up!
Chose your guns, point forward.
Face the enemies among us, push to the limit to stake your claim.

Move up, watch out!
Never look back, never fall down.
Every day a struggle, fighting a battle we'll never win.

This is the art of survival. Standing strong against the odds
Defy the course of existence, while the world wants to drag you down
This is the art of survival.
Standing strong against the odds. You can doubt while we stand and fight

Promises made to ourselves, we kept alive in our hearts.
Even when we faced hard times or suffer to survive.

Straight up, take down!
Never give up, not one step back.
Our will cannot be broken. Find the strength to overcome defeat.

This is the art of survival. Standing strong against the odds
Defy the course of existence, while the world wants to drag you down
This is the art of survival.
Standing strong against the odds. You can doubt while we stand our ground.

Promises made to ourselves, we kept alive in our hearts
Even when we faced hard times or suffer to survive.

The storm has passed, but the strength will remain.
Now more than ever, we don't look back, we stand as one.
Now more than ever, we won't give up, we stand alive.
