We are caught in a faceless war
Opposite stances of empty ideals
When beliefs are put to the test
Hearts are bleeding in despair

Trapped in a crossfire
There is no way out
In this hell we stand alone
Conform or fall with the rest

Lost in a circle of hate
Damned to pay the price of past
Holding breath hoping for this to end
Humanity is almost lost

Trapped in a crossfire
There is no way out
In this hell we stand alone
Conform or fall like the rest

There's no way out
We stand alone
There's no way out
In this war
You can run but can't hide

We are caught in a faceless war
Opposite stances of empty ideals
When beliefs are put to the test
Hearts are bleeding in despair

Trapped in a crossfire.
There is no way out
In this hell we stand alone
Conform or fall like the rest
