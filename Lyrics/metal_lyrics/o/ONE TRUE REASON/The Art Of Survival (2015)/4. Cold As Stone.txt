Realize that all you want for me
Is coming back at you
By my side or below, you choose
You can only make promises.
I'll make you keep them through and through

I am my own savior
All idols must fall
Cold as stone I remain.
I'll carve my heart out
If that's what is takes

I carry the scars of a violent time.
When I decide to not live a lie.
When I decide to don't wave no flag
Just keep the flame strong.

Don't wave no flag
Just keep the flame strong
Don't wave no flag
Just keep the flame strong

Without commitment
Expectations will be lost
Cold as stone I remain
My life, my dreams, I won't throw away

I carry the scars of a violent time.
When I decide to not live a lie.
When I decide to don't wave no flag
Just keep the flame strong.

Don't wave no flag
Just keep the flame strong
Don't wave no flag
Just keep the flame strong

On my shoulders, I carry the weight
Of the choices I left behind
I'm gonna keep myself cold as stone
Even if life goes without a plan.
