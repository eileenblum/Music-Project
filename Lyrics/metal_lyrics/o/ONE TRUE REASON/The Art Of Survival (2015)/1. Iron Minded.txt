Duty calls, can you hear?
Choose your path, fight or flee
Like a diamond I resist
Iron mind and armed with fists

I'm the one forged in fire
Control my will, all my desires
Command my body and link my soul

I chose my path - made of hate
For all I've seen, fueled by strength

Battle hurts, can you feel?
Face your fears, kill or be killed
Like an armor, I resist
Iron mind and armed with fists

I'm the one marked by time
Time spent to achieve my goals
Time that made me built to last

I chose my path - made of hate
For all I've seen, fueled by strength

Is choose or be chosen
I made my choice!

Construction, destruction
It has defined who I am
Born with nothing, uncertain fate
But the pain only feed my strength

The pain only feed my strength

I chose my path - right or wrong
A mind of steel sustains my strength
