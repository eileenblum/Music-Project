The land we tread is a mystery. 
And always there remains the eternal question: 
What can be the purpose of an existence doomed to flicker out? 
Can it be that life is a mistake, and that death is right, 
For we are all equal when we pass before it. 
But our drive to live cries out the contrary. 
Can it be, that if we submit to our destiny 
Till the hour of our death, that we will learn 
That we have been dead from the moment of our birth? 
A book always has a last page, a moment when it is closed. 
And yet, without an author, or a story, there can be no book. 
That is why, I ask myself if being the author of our own lives 
Does not mean, that in some way we live forever. 
Making, sometimes, choices that no reasonable spirit could imagine. 
The One that will come to you seeks a path. 
I send him to you for he yearns for liberty and an impossible selfless love. 
In coming to you, he must give up his struggles, his sorrows and sufferings; 
His pride, and even his need to be loved. 
He must risk his life to finally live, so that others may know this freedom: 
So that he may become, Himself, capable of this unattainable love. 
Today, he took the kind of decision that no rational spirit could entertain. 
He accepted the Mission.
