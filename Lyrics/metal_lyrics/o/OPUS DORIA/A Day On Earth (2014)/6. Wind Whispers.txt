Voices coming from beyond the sky
Whisper in my ears into my heart
Stars and secrets of another world
Penetrate into my soul

Freedom, beyond the earth,
Giving the sun a song of victory,
Chasing away shadows and despair,
For a world of honor and glory!

In the depths of the universe,
Many angels with their silver wings,
Such beautiful warriors of light,
Guide us towards the end of times

Freedom, beyond the earth,
Giving the sun a song of victory,
Chasing away shadows and despair,
For a world of honor and glory!

Freedom, beyond the earth,
Giving the sun a song of victory,
Chasing away shadows and despair,
For a world of honor and glory!

Freedom, beyond the earth
Giving the sun a song of victory
Chasing away shadows and despair,
For the glory of eternity!
