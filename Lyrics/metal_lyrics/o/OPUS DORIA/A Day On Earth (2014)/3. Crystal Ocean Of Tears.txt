Alone, and looking out at the vast ocean, 
I feel all my dreams dying, one by one 
The memories I thought lost are reappearing, 
The waves cast them at my feet like so much junk 
But what if it was best to all forget? 

With anger and regret 
With bitterness and rage 
Iâm left crying on the beach 
My tears are better than the ocean 
At wiping out my traces on the strand 
In the breakers I can see some faces spinning 
In the eddies I must seek them at the edge 
My memories are swirled up in the water 
My hopes are swallowed up in the abyss 
What can I do now to avert my doom? 

In my ravaged tearful face I catch a glimpse of yours, 
Such an object of desire to now forego! 
From your distant untouched lips comes forth no word to me, 
Just the caress that of your hand one night I felt 
And what if it is best to forget you? 

With anger and regret 
With bitterness and rage 
Iâm left crying on the beach. 
My tears are better than the ocean 
At wiping out my traces on the strand 
In the breakers I can see some faces spinning 
In the eddies I must seek them at the edge 
My memories are swirled up in the water 
My hopes are swallowed up in the abyss 
What can I do now to avert my doom? 

All my broken dreams, my distant memories, 
All those far-off, unknown, human shapes,	
I just donât know what itâs all done to me! 
I just deliver myself to its dread embrace 

As I sought you through those wild crystal waters 
From the depths the wrecks of memory re-appear 
Dragged up by demented mermaids are the treasures 
That I hoped no more to find! 
And now my cries are borne away by raging waves and tearing skies 
The howling wind, my tears, dries off my cheeks, 
And now at last I can know who I am!
