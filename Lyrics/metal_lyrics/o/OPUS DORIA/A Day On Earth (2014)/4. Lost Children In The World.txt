In their eyes, the blue of the sky
The blue and the sparkling gold,
Two lost children,
Two lost children in the Promised Land
Two lost children walking hand in Hand

Two lost children, walking on the Earth,
Strangers to the madness all around
Riding the Phoenix they escape
Itâs just love that frees them from the ground

Riches of your Kingdoms do not tempt them,
Possibilities of Power just leave them cold
Only the treasures of their hearts unleash a wind
Itâs the power of Love that forms them growing old

Two lost children, walking on the Earth,
Strangers to the madness all around
Riding the Phoenix they escape
Itâs just love that frees them from the ground

Just one amidst this tumult, his eyes seek only her,
Despite her chains, her arms reach out to him:
They are the perfect Seekers
From the prisons of your lives, they seek only Liberty
They scorn your insults, scorn your systems, search for Life...

Two lost children, walking on the Earth,
Strangers to the madness all around
Riding the Phoenix they escape
Itâs just love that frees them from the ground

Two lost children, walking on the Earth
Strangers to the madness all around
Seeking, searching, here and there and always
For the Love of a perfect World!
