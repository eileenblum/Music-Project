Itâs the end of a long quest, a real new beginning,
Renouncing forever the futile search for meaning,
Renouncing forever the futile search for pleasure,
To search on far horizons for lifeâs real, deepest measure

Adieu to you all! Your Sage has gone on far ahead!
In your ignorance you struggle; youâll struggle till youâre dead

Bewildered by your questions, dismayed by your ideas,
Felled by your vain certainties and staggered by your tears,
He listened to you weeping the existential scream
But in all your futile fighting, what do you really mean?

Adieu to you all! Your Sage has gone on far ahead!
In your ignorance you struggle; youâll struggle till youâre dead

On him fall the tears of Heaven
On him and on the Earth around
Let your tears pass from misery to action
Let none forget his tears
That in his life fell to the ground

Adieu to you all! Your Sage has gone on far ahead
In your ignorance you struggle; youâll struggle till youâre dead

Of him there will remain a living memory
What will we all make of His dark history?
