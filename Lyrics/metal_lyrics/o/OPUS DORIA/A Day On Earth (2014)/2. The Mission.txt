Sent on a winter night
Alone, riding to his destination
Braving darkness and flashes of light,
That he could accomplish his mission:
Bring the letter that will arise
Finally peace and justice in this land

Neither cold nor rain can stop him
His enemies are legion in the dark
Though the wolves are lurking in the night
A secret hope inflames his lion heart!
The mouth of the white frame foaming
Rider of the impossible in the wind

Brambles, thorns across the way
Face covered with blood, the sword by the side
Messenger still carrying away
The desire to honor his solemn promise!
Finally above the mounts the day rises
He stood steady in his frantic race
