It's my way, inflicting myself pain
I'm so in love with myself today
In preparation, of my suffocation
I hide myself from the light of day
My fantasy becomes reality
Make me fulfill my destiny
My desire is making me a liar
What I do is not for you to see

In darkness, in secrecy
I play a game that's only meant for me
On my own, inside the danger zone
Giving myself the rush where I for long
Stronger than me, addicted to the thrill
I thrust my head, and shake my hand
And bring myself to the promised land

Feeling high, in my tourniquet
Penetrating my fist
Feel the rush, loosing my control
Here I cum, here I go...

Masturbate
Ejaculate
Adrenaline
Suffocate....
