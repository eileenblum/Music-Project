Castaways, abused and thrown away
Left to be a face without a name
Silently endure the pain and fear
Uncertainty is your destiny

Close your eyes
Fulfill the devil's needs forced to be
What you're not supposed to be
Torn apart between hate and fear
Angel smiles
To hide your bitter tears

A victim of wealth and poverty
Live amongst sexual brutality
Ones inside escaping is too late
Live your life
Playing angel's masquerade

Mental violation
Daily fornication
Living nightmares endlessly
An angel never to be

Angel's masquerade
Angel's masquerade
