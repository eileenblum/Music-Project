Come home, come shelter safe and warm
They promise you passion, undying love
You'll give, they'll take
Until there's none
You think your nightmare's ended
It's just begun

To late, regrets
It's too late
They've got you entangled
Always
Exhale, inhale
Insanity
They're you, you'll be
What they want you to be

Divine capture
Divine capture

You must understand
Suffering
Is a part
Of life

Find power, find strength
Within yourself
Escapeing the darkness
The shadowlands
There's hope around you
It's in yourself

Divine capture
