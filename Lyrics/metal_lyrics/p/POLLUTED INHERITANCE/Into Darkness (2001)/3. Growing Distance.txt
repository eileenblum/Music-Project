You behave like someone I don't know
Not like the person I used to know
How did you become like this
You became what I hate the most

Liar

I watch you and think how could this be
You're not my friend nor enemy
The best in you I try to seek
But every time you're disappointing me

Growing distance

All believe will pass away
As soon as truth turns to lies
When promises are not being made
A friendship slowly dies
