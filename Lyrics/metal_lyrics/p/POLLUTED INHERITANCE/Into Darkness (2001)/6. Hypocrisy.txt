You hide yourself behind a mask
A mask of hypocrisy
You don't know passion or sympathy
I disgust your greed
You're only thinking about yourself
You don't care 'bout me
Lying and cheating to reach your goal
To leave me in misery

Strive for power live for yourself
"Me, myself, and I"
I despise your existance
See right through your lies
The lie you live is not a life
When you have to hide
Behind your mask of hypocrisy
Behind your mask of lies

You make me sick
You make me sick

In the end you can't hide
Behind your lies
In the end you can't hide
Behind your disguise
