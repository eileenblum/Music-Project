Can you live with me, as you all see me
Are you satisfied, by what you see
Am I approved to live, enough that I give
Allright that I live
Fine where I live

Am I free to be
The way I want to be

Are you sure of me, the way I want to be
Are you sure of me, can I be free
Can I be myself, do I have to ask
How I want to live
How I should behave

Am I free
The way I want to be

Can I live in your world
Is it my world too
Am I free to be, Am I free to see
Can I be myself, can I do my ways
Can I live my life
How I want to be
