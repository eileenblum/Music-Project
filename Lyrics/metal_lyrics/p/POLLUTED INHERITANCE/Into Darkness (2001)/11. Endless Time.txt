Takes his life
For he must die
To be with her
In endless time

Her face he sees still clearly
Her skin so soft and warm
No longer is she near him
Her tender smile is gone

They can not imagine
His pain and suffering
Each day he has to live
With only memories

A life now filled with grief
So suddenly destroyed
She's taken out of reach
He's siucked into a void

Escape this emptiness
With her he wants to be
Ending this lonely life
Embrace her endlessly

Takes his life
For he must die
To be with her
In endless time
