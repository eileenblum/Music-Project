Salt water is drowning my eyes
Inside me my heart seems to die
Silently I bare my sorrow
My burden, my secret to hide

Feelings so twisted
Confusion and hate
I must not think this way
Live my own life

An anger that won't go away
Inside me until my last day
Wounds that won't heal in my mind
A pain forever to stay

I am free I control my own destiny
I control my life

Feelings so twisted
Confusion and hate
I must not think this way
Live my own life
To leave the past behind
