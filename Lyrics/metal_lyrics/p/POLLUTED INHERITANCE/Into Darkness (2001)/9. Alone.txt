Here I am alone and fading away
A shadow of what I used to be
Who cares for me?
Am I still a part of humanity

Days go by
They seem like years

Each day
Is filled
With my
Old tears

Is there still a reason for me to stay?
Another season
Another day

Here I am alone and faded away
My shadow is all that's left of me
Who cares for me?
I am no more a part of humanity
