I am broken - unstable mentally
Life has spoken - I want to flea into darkness
I want to be all alone
End it silently
Who's to blame for this misery
Who's to blame
For me

Lived my life
Inside me
End my future
To be free

What is life blaming yourself
For all the sorrow
Life becomes hell
Now farewell to my emptiness
Ending my future to forget the past
Ending the sorrow
At last

My life: I see no hope
Just grief

Lived my life
Inside me
End my future
To be free
