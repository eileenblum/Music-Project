I can't suppress, the urge inside
The addiction controls my mind
Searching for the infant flesh
To fulfill my desire

I will seek and I will find
The life, the body will be mine
So young, so pure
I need the pleasure, more and more

The addiction, my excuse, my reason to abuse
This illness so strong
This illness so wrong

I can't resist the call for more
And as I hear
The voice of my greed
I complete my pleasure
To kill

The desire for the infant
Can't control the urge inside
The rape
The kill is addicted in my mind
The addiction, my excuse, my reason

The screams I hear
Their begging their fear

I must proceed, this inhuman deed
To rape, to kill, my needs must
Be fulfilled
