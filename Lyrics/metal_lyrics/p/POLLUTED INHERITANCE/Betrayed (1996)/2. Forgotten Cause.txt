You seem me as an enemy
What have I done wrong?
What have you got against me?
Do you really know?!!

The hate you feel for me
Is not yours
But your forefather's
And ithose before
You do not know why
This is so
It's only history
That you follow

Forgotten cause - Remembered hate
Behold the past - Revenge the pain

Why don't you leave me be
The way I want to be
Respect my choice of life
As I do yours

Forgotten cause - Remembered hate
