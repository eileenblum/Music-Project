Born at the wrong time
In the wrong place
Subhuman?
Danger to scoiety?
The elimination of those
Who don't know
Betrayal by those
You live with
No place in this world

No sense of humanity
No sense of life
The adult child has to die
A systematic destruction
To purify your pathetic
Race

Ride behind your symbols
Your fake truth
Saviour of humanity
Your insanity is your truth

Take my life
Free my soul
Save your life
Kill your soul
