Beleive in me and my insanity
The new born god, salvation that you seek
Reject your past
Live your life by my hand
Soon to behold my insande primised land

Those who will join, shall meet eternal peace
Drowning in faith and my insanity
Obey to me and every word I preach
Devote your life, as you will die for me

Blessed by me
I am he
Set you free
For eternity

Believe in me
I set you free
