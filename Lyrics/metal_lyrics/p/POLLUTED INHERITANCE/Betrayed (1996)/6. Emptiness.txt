See the world through my eyes
All you see is weakness
It's not a cause of insanity
It's a cause of pain
What's the use of life
If you want to be dead

I take my life in my own hands
Selfish thoughts?!

Suicide
The only way to escape from this life
Emptiness
Fulfilles my world, now I want to die

It's my choice don't you see
To forever end this misery

Inner fears I can't deny
Salvation when I die?
No more pain no more lies
From this world I can't hide
