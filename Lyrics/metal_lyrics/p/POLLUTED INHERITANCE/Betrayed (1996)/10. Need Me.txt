Come to me where you feel safe
I comfort you with my warm embrace
There is no sorrow, there is no pain

In this world I give
Take me
I let you see how you want it to be
Take me, Take me
I am the way out of your misery
Take me

I did not choose you, you chose me
Now I will help you to escape reality
You try to fight but you cannot win
The pain comes back, you loose again

I let you see how you want it to be
Take me need me hear me
Take me feed me

I am your life
I am your truth
I am your breath
I am you death
