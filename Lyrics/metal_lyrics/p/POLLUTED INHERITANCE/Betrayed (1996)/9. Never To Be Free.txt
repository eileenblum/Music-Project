Can we trust and believe in these
Words of deceit
Is the truth unrevealed
Must we seek for what's real

True words misused
So confused
What are lies
What's the truth

Contradiction every spoken word
Disbelief with their fall of disguise
Lost and deeper they fall
Inot hte strangling claws of their lies
Remain with the pitiful believe in yourself

Never to be free
