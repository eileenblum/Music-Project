My soul floats
After death
But where is heaven now?
No golden gate
Between clouds
No angel-harp harmonies
Unconsciously I realise
The house of god stays hidden
They promised me
Eternal life
How could it be a lie?!

I feel the presence near me
Of thousand souls or more
I sense the desperation
Of souls all been betrayed
Drifting on the waves of sadness
Our souls seek eternal peace
There's only darkness on
Our way
Lost in the caverns of time

Where is the paradise, promised for?
How could I've been betrayed?
Where is the place, of eternal peace?
Where are the golden gates?
