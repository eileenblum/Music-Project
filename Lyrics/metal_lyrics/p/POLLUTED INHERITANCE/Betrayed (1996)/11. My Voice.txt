In a psychotic state
Dreaming when I'm awake
Seeing things only I can see
A fantasy in reality
Panic takes control
Sink away in a sea of black
Caught in my twisted soul
Is there a way back?

A fantasy? Reality?

Whisperings of the unknown voice
What I see is not my choice
I belive it's real what I see

A fantasy in reality
A fantasy in reality

The world looks insane to me
Will you please set me free
I'm on the edge of insanity

I'm alone with my voice

The only thing I now need
Is a piece of reality
Please don't let me be
Living in captivity
Who should I believe
Is it you or is it me

The only thing that I now need
Is a piece of reality
Please don't let me be
Living in captivity
