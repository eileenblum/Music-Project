Inside suffering deep inside
Something is drinking my blood
It's eating and eating
Until my guts splash out
The smell of rotting flesh
Is ripping me apart
Crawling deep inside of me
It's eating to my heart

Still eating and eating
The rotting will get out
Heavily bleeding
Dripping from my mouth

Inside rottings!
It's crawling and eating
Inside rottings!
A cruel ending of my life

Inside rottings!
It's crawling and eating
Inside rottings!
A cruel ending of my life

My body is falling to pieces
The ending is nearby
The hunger of this creature
It is leaving me to die

Inside rottings!
It's crawling and eating
Inside rottings!
A cruel ending of my life

See yourself lying
Your body is rotting inside
This slow unknown disease
Has taken a part of your life
Your lifeless carcass decayed
The seeds of death remain
It is through your earthly torture
Enjoy unearthly pain

Slowly you die
Eaten from inside
