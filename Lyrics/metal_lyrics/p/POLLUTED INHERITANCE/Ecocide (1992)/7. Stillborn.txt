From the womb of
Darkness and fear
Facing the world of
Agony and fear
Your conscienceness
Slipping away
Never to see
The light of day

No more breathing
No sense of life
Time to decay
Born with the innocence
Of a child
Died with the knowledge
Of pain. Pain!

Leave the world of mankind
Step out the world of death
Uncertainty leaving behind
Enjoy the sleep of the mind

Stillborn... Stillborn!

Live... in the land of death
More living than living instead
Secure in this world you see
Living in certainty

You see their greed
That you never feel
Life without soul
You see their badge
That you will never need
Their voice of death will call

Stillborn
