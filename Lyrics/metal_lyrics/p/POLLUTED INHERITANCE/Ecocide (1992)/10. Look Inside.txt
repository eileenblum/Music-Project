Look inside...
The mind the thoughts of some one else
See their pain...
Their anger joys and biggest fears
Sneak in...
As they lay down and go to rest
Concentrate...
On dreams of those that you selected

Crawl in their dreams
Dig in dig deep
Give them their pain
Don't wake them up
Give them their fear
Hear their heartbeat
Make it stop

You sleep in tight...
Sweet dreams are now forbidden
Heartbeat...
It is growing fast your body sweats
I am inside...
I make your biggest fear alive
Inside your head
No place to run no place to hide

Look inside

I am asleep
Horrid dreams
My heart just stopped
I cannot breath
