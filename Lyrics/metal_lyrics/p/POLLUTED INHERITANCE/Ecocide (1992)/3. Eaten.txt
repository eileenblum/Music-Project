Amputation
Cut off your limbs
Feel no pain
I show you how
And make you watch
As I consume it

A sick way
Of taking your life
Piece by piece
To make you all mine

I wait I let you heal
But hunger screams within me
Again I consume my meal
Become a part of me

Soon you will be all mine
To eat you just a matter of time

You are already dead
I know it sounds insane
The last part is your head
The last part is your brain
