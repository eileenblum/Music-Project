I am lying here being dead
It feels like having sweet dreams
It does not hurt
I am tranquillised
From different sides I see me
Patiently I am awaiting
For what is soon to come
My carcass swallowed by nature
This process has just begun

Flesh gets weak, it is melting
My face is not what is has been
There is no cure, in existence
Await the ending silently
Maggots feed on my rottings
Thousands crawl inside of me
Flesh has turned into liquid
When it is gone I will be set free

I float into the other side
My soul is carried by seas of blood
I am dead this is the afterlife
A place without a so called god
