Obsessed by death
Destructive thoughts
We will never last
Soon life is gone

Substance of existence
Death of man by man itself
Substance of existence
Nothing's to remain... remain!

Mistakes and faults
Centuries of war
We will never learn
Of formal things
We have done

Substance of existence
Death of man by man itself
Substance of existence
Nothing's to remain - Remain!

Mother to daughter
Father to son
Fighting each other
Like long sworn enemies

Decisions by those
Of higher hand
Let weapons speak
Destroy your friends
