Receiving spells upon my life
From a place of horror and darkness
Haunted by black witchery
My soul is pulled into the abyss

Fear tortures my mind
Fear drives me insane
Scream out the agony and pain
Fear

Haunted by frightening nightmares
The unsolved torturing... is nearby
Starting to loose control of my mind
Losing the grip of my life

Fear tortures my mind
Fear drives me insane
Scream out the agony and pain
There is nothing left to remain

Voices cry to bit me welcome
My time has come to face all their trails
Fulfil their needs of sadistic butchering
Do I live? Do I die?

Fear

Open the gates of pleasure
Not for me but for their own greed
To sense the pain it seems never-ending
If I live then please take my life
