Remember the days of the past
That continues in days to come
Wounds that are carved to stay
Pain that will never fade away

Memories of sadness
Never to be blocked away
Blocked away
Blocked away

The always returning nightmares
Feel his breath upon your skin
See the madness in his eyes, in his face

Innocent you fall asleep
You will awaken soon
His body is touching you
You stand the pain of this abuse
Your life is a lie, in this world
You are all alone, in disbelief

Memories of sadness
Never to be blocked away

Memories of sadness
Always to stay
