Dissolvent - From the inside out
Flesh corrodes - Mysterious ways
Liquid flows - From the inside out
Finds its way - To let the body unburden!

Eyes transform into liquid
Flow down the face like tears
The brain seeps slowly out
The head remains as empty skull

Feel the body drip away
Weaken day by day
Diagram eviscerates
The brain dissolves

The corpse reveals its bones
Flesh flown away
A skeleton left over
Bones turn blank in the sun

Soil takes the liquid flesh
Absorbs the fluid
A storm soon will thrive
Brings the rain
Rain strikes the ground
Cleanses the soil
The liquid finds its way
Inserts a life

Again the dripping starts
A life will flow away
Another being found
To give its life away
