Over the hills and forests and the quiet homes
Past the lake and meadow; past the fields
Over grain that dances to the sound
Of the wind that sings a last

Goodbye
I close my eyes
As I sink into the night
My heavy heart takes flight

Your nightly wandering ephemeral
But you gave the meadow back its light
Oh the willow stands ethereal
As its branches wave a last

Goodbye
I close my eyes
As I sink into the night
My heavy heart takes flight

Carry me home on the wings of the night
Carry me home may our spirits unite
Carry me home on paper wings
Carry me home like you did in my dreams

Oh carry me home tonight
Carry me home we've been waiting so long
Carry me home for this moment to come
Oh carry me home tonight

Carry me home to the morning light
Carry me home before you wave me goodbye
