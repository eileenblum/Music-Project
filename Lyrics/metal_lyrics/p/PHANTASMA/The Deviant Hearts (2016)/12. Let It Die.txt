Silent sleep, violent dreams
Sum up to silent screams
I can't manage to block them out
Fragmented memories

Tell my heart not to beat
For its pounding gets way too loud
Lay me down oh weigh me down
My mind keeps telling me lies

Most of all that if it was not for me
You'd still be fine
Every experience
All the places I've been

All the things I have said and done:
Half of it, too intense
Half of it meaningless
Maybe I have been better off.

The revenants alive inside the
Golden cage of my mind
But nothing changed, nothing took the pain away
So now it's time

To let it die
Let it die
Deceitful friend of mine
Life the veil and reveal all this time

Let it die
Can't keep the truth inside
See the pain and the fear and the lies
Silent sleep, comes to me

When I'm finally free
I can not wait to meet you there
All this time spent apart
Oh my deviant heart

Skips a beat, I'm no longer scared
The revenants alive inside the
Golden cage of my mind
But nothing changed, nothing took the pain away

So now it's time
Oh it's time to let it go
Time to face it, time to take control
Time to let it go

Time to face it all
Let it die
Let it die
Deceitful friend of mine

Life the veil and reveal all this time
Let it die
Can't keep the truth inside
Leave the pain and the fear all behind

And we'll meet on the other side
