When I was a young girl
Father said to me
Life is nothing like a grand symphony
It's like when you know this one line
Sing it and repeat
But you don't recall the rest of the song
It's incomplete

You can spend your whole life
Trying to recall
Or enjoy the sound you've known
Or the words and the melodies
Don't they taste sweet
Why would you go and chase bigger dreams

When I was a young boy
My father said to me
Life is nothing like a grand symphony
Like when you know this one line
Sing it and repeat
You don't recall the rest of the song
It's incomplete

You can spend your whole life
Trying to break free
Or enjoy the home I've made
Oh our balance it can be disturbed so easily
Why would you go and chase bigger dreams

When I was a young girl
Father said to me
Life is nothing like a grand symphony
Like when you know this one line
Sing it and repeat
But you don't recall the rest of the song
It's incomplete
