Run away with me
Explore the endless possibilities
I'll break your fall and you'll break mine
It's how it is how it will always be

I pray infinitely
For a different deity
Than the atrocity that haunts me in my sleep

We all fall from our pedestal, into your dreams
Beyond concepts of "real" it is just an illusion
Lose your grip with me

Run away with me
For the horizon holds a mystery
I've got you back and you've got mine
It's how it is how it will always be

I'll pray each day and night
To keep these demons out of sight
To guide the both of you, back into the light
