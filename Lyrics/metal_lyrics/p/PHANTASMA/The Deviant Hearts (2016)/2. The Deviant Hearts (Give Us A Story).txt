Here in my arms
Reflections of my face
For you I'd make
The world a better place
Build a kingdom with four walls
I will keep you safe from harm
Here I've got you
Please worry not
Together we'll beat the odds

Somebody
Give us a story
Narrate all the places
That we'll never see
Give us a haven
For our imagination
So at least in our minds
We can attempt to be free

Hush now my child
All good things come in time
Days might look grey
But you'll soon realise
You can't take yourself too far
Remember who you are
Here I've got you
Please worry not
Remember your deviant hearts

Somebody
Give us a story
Narrate all the places
That we'll never see
Give us a haven
For our imagination
So at least in our minds
We can attempt to be free

Somebody, give us a story
Narrate all the places
That we'll never see
It's not that we're lonesome
But the days just get too long
And the splendid horizon
Is calling for me

Somebody, give us a story
Give us a myth, a legend, any old tale
It's such a small world
If we don't want to get hurt
But at least in our minds
It doesn't look quite as pale
