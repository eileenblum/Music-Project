Look at yourself
Sitting and waiting
Look at your days
Wasting away
Where can you go?
And what scares you so?
And why does every moment
Make this feeling grow

Look at yourself
Look a bit closer
Look at the years
Passing you by
Life lost all its spark
And I've lost to the dark
And why does nothing
Take the edges off

Try, try not to get stuck
Get stuck into bigger things
And bite into bigger dreams
What good is a life
Spent every day in hiding

Your heart, a wild animal
Your rib cage a size too small
Can you feel it scratch the bone from deep within
I fold you a paper crane
A soul you can animate
With a new life, that you wish you could be leading
And if it don't work out well
Just let it all go to hell
I hear it's a most interesting place
Just don't let it go to waste

Look at yourself
Sitting and waiting
Look at your days
Wasting away
Life lost all its spark
And I've lost to the dark
And why does nothing
Take the edges off
