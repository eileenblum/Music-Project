October blocked my roots so forcefully
clouds and rain are weighing down on me
A rootless tree won't last a many storm
A frozen soul can't teach you to be warm

October clouds announce my time to leave
If I stayed I'd only take you down with me
This loveless child won't make a caring mother
Cold-blooded heart can't teach to love another

Runaway grey
Taking me away
Drift with the clouds to better days
Runaway grey
Taking me away

Hopefully time will heal the wounds
Hopefully I'll return to you

I've seen the end, it's pretty grim
My many warnings won't get through to him
I'll try to take all our misfortunes with me
He won't understand, but surely he'll forgive me

If someone would listen I would say it's over
If someone would listen I would say we're done
If someone would listen I would say we're all just
Staring down the barrel of a gun
