Here you are my little ones
Welcome to my waters
Welcome children of the fall
Let me introduce:

I'm the voice that stirs the air
Force that fills the waters
I have drawn men to their doom
Women, children too!

But I won't drag you down
You've got my word on this
Dance the black waves now
Let my voice yours hearts caress

History misunderstood this deity
Miserable me!
Oh why is the deep dark-shored sea
The only friend to me?

Here you are my little pets
See my burdened shoulders
Help me lift the weight of debt
Burden off my past

I'm the voice that shakes the ground
Fills the air with wonder
I have drawn men to their doom
But never intended to!

I won't drag you down
If you just take my hand
Dance the black waves now
Help me lift the weight of debt

History misunderstood this deity
Miserable me!
Oh why is the deep dark-shored sea
The only friend to me?

History misunderstood this deity
Come set me free!
Oh why is the deep dark-shored sea
The only friend to me?
