For as long as I care to remember
For a small eternity
I've been hearing the calls
And witnessing the falls
Of a kind, as small as thee

For as long as I care to recall things
For many a century
I've been playing their game
And taking all the blame
Lonely soul, there's none like me

Save me
Tear me to pieces
Leave not a trace
Of what I have been

Save me
And shatter my being
You'll have a friend in me
Set me free!

Each star that's fallen from the sky
Didn't I satisfy
Your every wish?
Each king or queen that fell from grace

They have all seen my face
But sealed their own fate and
Each time your touch turns life to gold
Your destiny's foretold

I answer to your desire!
Is this how your kind
Repays its dues,
Shows their gratitude?

Save me
Tear me to pieces
Leave not a trace
Of what I have been

Save me
And shatter my being
You'll have a friend in me
Set me free!

I've known the torches and the scorn
But why didn't I comply
With your every wish?

I've known the lost and the forlorn
They have all seen my face
But sealed their own fate and
Don't buy into the hate and fear

Let all those poor souls hear:
You've brought this upon yourself
Is this how your kind
Repays its dues
Shows their gratitude

Save me
Tear me to pieces
Leave not a trace
Of what I have been

Save me
And shatter my being
You'll have a friend in me
Set me free!

I remember finding you here
I remember everything
Did you make up your mind about me

Used to think so badly of meâ¦
I remember finding you here
I can vividly recall
If you wish this time, wish wisely
We will end this together once and for all

Save me
Tear me to pieces
Leave not a trace
Of what I have been

Save me
And shatter my being
You'll have a friend in me
Set me free!
