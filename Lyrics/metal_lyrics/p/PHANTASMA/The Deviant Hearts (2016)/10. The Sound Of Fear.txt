Spirit sister, here we are
Ships beneath the waves of time
A heart to hard, we vowed the ache
I finally believe I'm fine

Don't waste your tears on me, I am through
The only thing I miss is you

I will not awake to the sound of fear
Every sound a sign for my heart not to beat
I will not awake, I will reappear
Anytime, anywhere, but here

Spirit sister, hear me out
I am not giving up, but letting go
From this day on, I'll never be
Afraid of being afraid anymore

Don't waste your tears on me, I am through
The only thing I miss is you

I will not awake to the sound of fear
Every sound a sign for my heart not to beat

I will not awake, I will reappear
Anytime, anywhere, but here

Oh, let me go
Oh, let me go

Don't waste your tears on me, it's all right
At least we got to say goodbye
Goodbye...

I will not awake to the sound of fear
Every sound a sign for my heart not to beat
I will not awake, I will reappear
Anytime, anywhere, but here

I will not awake to the sound of fear
Every sound a sign for my heart not to beat
I will not awake, I will reappear
Anytime, anywhere, but here
Anytime, anywhere, but here
