Soon... Yes, soon the time will come
To punish you for your crimes
For thousand of poor men
You deceived and destroyed
You false prophets
Fucking mangy dogs
You cannot fool me
I'm invisible
Get ready
The court awaits you
Day of reckoning
I will be the master
The ordinary man
I will put an end to you
You mangy dogs
No more lies
Time for truth have come
Soon...
