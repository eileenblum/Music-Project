Strange unknown land
Unknown plants
Everything is different and nice
Wonderful life

I can't see humiliation here
No church the holy
Everything here is nature
We live in harmony with nature

Strange smell in the atmosphere
Spiral Columns
Unknown life
I sink into eternity

I can't see humiliation here
No church the holy
Everything here is nature
We live in harmony with nature
