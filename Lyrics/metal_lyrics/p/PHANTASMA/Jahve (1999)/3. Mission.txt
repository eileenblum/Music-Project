You live your life
In painful desires
You call for freedom
No one wanting to hear you

-solo Andy

So come and execute the
Command
Use your power, your spells
Fight hard and with no compassion

I want to hear crying
And lament of angels
Don't be regardful of anyone
Execute and murder

Prophecy has fulfilled
Human race damns you
Don't want to be like them
Fight for your freedom
