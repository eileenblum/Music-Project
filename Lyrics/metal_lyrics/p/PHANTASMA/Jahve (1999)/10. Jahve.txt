Secret voice whispered me
Jahve is dead
And suddenly I heard
Unknown voices

They sang the song of glory
The song of victory
Nicer and more sonorous
I had ever heard

My heart fulfilled
With peace and happiness
Jahve is dead

In the hour of his death
The eternal justice came
Windstorm is storming in
Distance
And choruses are heard again
