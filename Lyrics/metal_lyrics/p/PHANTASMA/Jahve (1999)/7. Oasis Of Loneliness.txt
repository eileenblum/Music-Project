Far from civilization
In deep dark woods
In beautiful nature
There is an oasis of loneliness

You are persecuted by
Inquisition
You have to run desperately
You will survive
Only if you stay alone

Oasis of loneliness

Sadness in your eyes
But hatred in your heart
Waiting for opportunity
Waiting for revenge

[solo Andy]
[solo Rudolf]

Far from civilization
In deep dark woods
In beautiful nature
There is an oasis of loneliness

You are persecuted by
Inquisition
You have to run desperately
You will survive
Only if you stay alone

Oasis of loneliness
