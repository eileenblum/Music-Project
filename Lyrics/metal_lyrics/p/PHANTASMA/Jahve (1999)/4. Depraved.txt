From earth's depths
Secret song sounds
You can hear that lament
The agony of Christians

I want to amplify that sound
To drown the face of Christians
Their singing face
Their false face

You can't stop me
Rather choose to die
'Til there is time
So die and very fast

I'm calling up the messengers of
ruins
Let them tear up the sacrifice
That I have assigned
Let it serve as a warning signal
For those who would like to
Defy
