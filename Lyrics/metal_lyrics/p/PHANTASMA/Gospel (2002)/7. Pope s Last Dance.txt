Oh pope...
Your church still blooms
Under the mask of innocence
Blooming in pagans blood
Oh pope...
I tell you it
The one who was assigned
To sit on throne of the ruler
Has not been born yet

Not a year will pass away
And the one will be born
Who will sit on the throne
Oh pope...

Curse!
Curse to your clan
To the thirteen clan!
Oh pope...

Oh pope...
Your church still blooms
Under the mask of innocence
Blooming in pagans blood
Oh pope...

I tell you it
The one who was assigned
To sit on throne of the ruler
Has not been born yet

Not a year will pass away
And the one will be born
Who will sit on the throne
Oh pope...

Take responsibility for your deeds
Not a year will pass
And I will call you to the court
To put you just punishment
Curse!
