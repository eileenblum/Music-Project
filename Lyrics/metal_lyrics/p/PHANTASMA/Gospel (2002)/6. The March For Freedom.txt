At last stop to listen
The desperate threatening callings
Of the last priests

And tell them
That you are not afraid anymore
And you scorn them

Tell them That you have already found the scourge of the truth
That opened your eyes
And showed the right way

So go and stop turning back
Go and be strong and ready
To be able to tread an all over

The answer to your questions
You have found already
That god is dead...
That god has always been dead...

At last stop to listen
The desperate threatening callings
Of the last priests

Tell them
That you have already found the scourge of the truth
That opened your eyes
And showed the right way
So go and stop turning back
Go and be strong and ready
To be able to tread an all over
