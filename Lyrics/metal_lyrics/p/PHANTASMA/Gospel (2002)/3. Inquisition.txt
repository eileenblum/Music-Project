Psychical vampires
Selfnamed masters of the world
Greedy pigs
Thieves of our freedom

Don't forget their deeds
When they murdered the innocents
When the old men and kids were dying
When an innocent mother begged
Was begging in flames for a mercy

Now the time has come
To silence their fat abdomens
Take them everything
Take them their mind an heart

Psychical vampires
Selfnamed masters of the world
Greedy pigs
Thieves of our freedom

Don't forget their deeds
When they murdered the innocents
When the old men and kids were dying
When an innocent mother begged
Was begging in flames for a mercy

Now the time has come
To silence their fat abdomens
Take them everything
Take them their mind an heart

The punishment won't miss them
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Kneel in front of me pope
You poor doll in hands of saint tyrants
And be prepared to die
