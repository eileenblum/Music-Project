I heard a strong voice
That ordered to the four demons
To go and still their goblets
Of Satan's anger on the Earth

And then left the first
And spill his goblet
And people got a disgusting
And wicked abscess
Whom were worshiping to the God

I heard a strong voice
That ordered to the four demons
I heard a strong voice
To go and still their goblets
Of Satan's anger on the Earth

And the second demon spill his goblet
On the sea and the springs of the river
Which changed to blood
And every living person has died in it

I heard a strong voice
That ordered to the four demons
To go and still their goblets
Of Satan's anger on the Earth

And the third demon spill his goblet
On the sun
Which burned people by the fire

I heard a strong voice
That ordered to the four demons
To go and still their goblets
Of Satan's anger on the Earth

And the fourth demon spill his goblet
On the air
And then the great destroying earthquake has arised

I heard a strong voice
That ordered to the four demons
To go and still their goblets
Of Satan's anger on the Earth
