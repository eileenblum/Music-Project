...Suddenly the roar was heard
Which spreaded through the endless space
That sounded as a storming thunder

...And then from the eternal darkness he's dive up
In his monstrous dread and beauty
The demon of the truth

...And with whole his strength he chopped an axe
To a forehead of fake saviour

...And then Jesus Christ denied his origin
His mother and father

...And with his last exhale
He said his true name:
Bastard!
Bastard!
Bastard!
Bastard!
