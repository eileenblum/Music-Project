Sign your armour
With the sign of pentagram on the chest
Raise your sword of revenge
And murder with no mercy

All around a lamentation
And cry of last Christians is heard
And suddenly the end is here
Vatican has fallen
And a new era is beginning
The marvelous life
Vatican has fallen

A new era is beginning
Life, the real life
The marvelous life
Strange silence come into being

Only clatter of our horses has been heard
We galloped the plains towards mountains
A feeling of victory could be seen at our faces

Sign your armour
With the sign of pentagram on the chest
Raise your sword of revenge
And murder with no mercy

All around a lamentation
And cry of last Christians is heard
And suddenly the end is here
Vatican has fallen
And a new era is beginning
The marvelous life
Vatican has fallen
Vatican has fallen
Vatican has fallen
Has fallen...

A new era is beginning
Life the real life
The marvelous life
Strange silence come into being
