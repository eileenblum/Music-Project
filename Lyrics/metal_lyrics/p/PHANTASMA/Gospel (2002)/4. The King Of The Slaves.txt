Listen what I'm saying
In vehement anger
You poor king of the slaves
Whose hands you tied with fear

You won't drink count's blood of the earth anymore
And eat meat of the brave heroes
You thief of freedom and honour
Bastard in human body

Listen what I'm saying
In vehement anger
You poor king of the slaves
Whose hands you tied with fear

You loose!
And as well everyone that gonna be with you
I let the fire and sulphur to rain on you
And remains of your body will eat wild animals

You'll get into forgotness
Where from is no way back
So human beings would rise again
And give birth to new heroes

You won't drink count's blood of the earth anymore
And eat meat of the brave heroes
You thief of freedom and honour
Bastard in human body

Listen what I'm saying
In vehement anger
You poor king of the slaves
Whose hands you tied with fear

You loose!
And as well everyone that gonna be with you
I let the fire and sulphur to rain on you
And remains of your body will eat wild animals
