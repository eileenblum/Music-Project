I'm the one
Who makes the clam rivers mad
Who calls the clouds and storms
Who awakes the tempests

I'm the king
Who spills the water from the river-beds
Me...
The undefeatable
And eternal...

Only I can manage break
The throats of Christians
By my voice and my singing
I move the rocks
The earth and the wood
By mine supernatural strength

On my command mountains tremble
The earth opens
And the dead rise from their graves

I'm the king
Who spills the water from the river-beds
Me...
The undefeatable
And eternal...

I'm the king
Who spills the water from the river-beds
Me...
The undefeatable
And eternal...
