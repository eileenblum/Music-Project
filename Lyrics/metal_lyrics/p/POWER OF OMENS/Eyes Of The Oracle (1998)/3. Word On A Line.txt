Wait, as we feared what's on the other side of this dream. 
I don't why it's this way, but 
Hey now, what the hell am I doing here? 
Seem to ask myself in the mind again. 
Whoa now, what the hell is going on? 
We work and slave till the night comes, 
That ain't right now. 
For Something still yet to find. 
Now the time's come, 
Let's find what's inside. 
It's the first time for the last time. 
Breathe in and hold your, hold your breath. 
This world has become a Word on A Line. 
My fingers shake as I try to swim, 
One more mile till we die... till we die. 
As we sail along to a film of us coming back. 
I don't why I feel the way I do but, 
There's something inside me, 
There's something inside that won't let me be. 
Just won't let me be... 
Just won't let me be... 
Whoa, Just won't let me be... 
Let us find. 
Let us find home. 
We work and slave till the night comes, 
That ain't right now. 
For Something still yet to find. 
Now the time's come, 
Let's find what's inside. 
It's the first time for the last time. 
Breathe in and hold your... 
A Word on a Line... 
Let me come along, 
Let one find the song, 
Let me find the words... 
Hey we'll find A Word on A Line is 
The last step to bring the rest into 
Perspective now... 
Hey we'll find out... 
Hey we'll find out why...
