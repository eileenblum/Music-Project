Hold just wait one minute now to 
Find a reason for these orders 
Please let me protect thee from the other side 
What's inside The Wall the images the painted feelings 
I must show 
Laugh at what I try to preach to shed the grievance 
Laugh at what I know you'll be the first to go 
Now let one inside of you and 
Let the feelings come from inside 
Soon they'll call me Angels calling 
They're singing in tune 
I watched as my mother cried all of this time 
Her vicious fight with the world 
That she can't seem to we can't seem to win 
And all this time we have fought 
With ourselves and we can't seem to win 
My words must shed the sunlight on The Naked Mind 
Born inside a womb 
Grow to rape the environment 
So sad that it's true 
The young so pure as a child 
So was it all in everything that we have done? 
Divide the boundary walls 
Let the freedom breed inside of two 
Minds that cry 
It sounds like listen to these words I 
Lay upon the naked mind 
Now let one inside of you and 
Let the feelings come from inside 
Soon they'll call me Angels calling 
They're singing in tune 
[Repeat chorus]
Now all I feel is nothing but you 
For the last time they will mock the truth 
[Repeat chorus]
