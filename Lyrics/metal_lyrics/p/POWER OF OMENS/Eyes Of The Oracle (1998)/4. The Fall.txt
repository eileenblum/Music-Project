As we look now, at what's been done, 
I look ahead and see, where's my 
Life I once held high, 
Higher than the sky, 
But where's the sea? 
To catch me when I fall. 
Once I portrayed a young man's dreams, 
Once I believed that, 
All that I needed was soul, it's cold. 
Was it all that we wanted? 
Was it all that we needed then? 
Were we, scared? Read me, 
Was it all that I wanted? 
Was it all that I needed then? 
Was I, Scared? 
Catch the Fallen. 
Wake up; open your eye, 
For what is to be is now, 
The warning of prophets denied. 
Can't you feel the coldness reply? 
Watch the darkness cloak the sky. 
Ignore this information, 
Driven mad from this infliction. 
Left upon my soul, 
That rots with no control. 
As we fall to the pits of the earth. 
I can feel what it, 
Don't you see what it? 
Don't you feel what it's done? 
...What it's done. 
The Fallen 
As I look up and see the lonely star in the sky, 
Well I know how he feels, alone, 
Alone in the sky. 
To see what's out there just look, 
Maybe one day we'll find... 
Let me fall to call the trial, 
Let some know, 
Let me fall to call the trial. 
I can feel the drops that fall from high above, 
I can hear the cries of many helpless ones. 
Though the hands of time are done, 
The winds of change have left me speechless, 
Please refill this hourglass that's turned to Stone. 
But I know I may be wrong, 
Though yesterday's come and gone, 
I know I'll make it strong today... 
I can feel the drops that fall from high above 
I can hear the cries of many helpless ones. 
Though the hands of time are done, 
The winds of change have left me speechless, 
Please refill this hourglass that's turned to Stone. 
But I know I may be wrong, 
Though yesterday's come and gone, 
I know I'll make it strong today... 
Once let me, I'm inside. 
Tearing your mind, 
Once you feel what the words have done, 
So now I know I've tried. 
Now as we hear, they changed their words 
And forgot their lies. 
Now as we fall, they changed their words 
And forgot their lives and, 
I know we'll find some way some how, 
I know we'll see a different road that, 
Leads my soul above the fall now, 
We'll hear the toll of church bells calling, 
Let one become one with the earth, 
You will see what it... 
You will feel what it... 
You will see what it's done, 
The Fall 
The Fallen, 
As we look up to see your mind, 
(Vocal Ad-lib) 
Become the one inside me.
