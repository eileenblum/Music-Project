Now it seems, all of yesterdays dreams gone 
For some time now, I'll close my mind and sleep 
Which way to turn what faces to follow 
The screams of lies have been broken now 
A vision of the secret land has been placed in these hands 
Will you believe me when I say? 
Will you tell me things that I used to say? 
Will I remember how it was? 
Now take the last drop of blood 
Now everyone inside 
I'll show you that it's time 
Please and try to understand 
The world is going to end now 
And if you will believe 
That I am the one that has been chosen 
For something I do not yet understand 
So I'm all alone now laughed at and torn in two 
Which one will I fallow I don't know 
I'm not for sure 
I'm not for sure 
Laughed at and torn in two 
Laughed at and torn, Why? 
Laughed at and torn in two 
Laughed at, laughed at, laughed at 
Why must I feel so Alone I Stand 
Why must I feel so Alone? 
Will you believe me when I say? 
Will you tell me things that I used to say? 
Will I remember how it was? 
Now take the last drop of blood 
Now everyone inside 
I'll show you that it's time 
Please and try to understand 
The world is going to end now 
And if you will believe 
That I am the one that has been chosen 
For something I do not yet understand
