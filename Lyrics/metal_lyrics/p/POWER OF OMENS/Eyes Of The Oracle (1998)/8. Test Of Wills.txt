[Part I: Awaiting Judgement]

I sit by the stream and raise my head 
The stream flows East... 
And I notice the breeze blows the trees 
In the same way. 
So I raise my head high 
As I close my eyes. 
I begin to run as fast as I can, 
Into the night. 
I sit and I wait for judgement. 
I sit and I wait for judgement soon. 
As I run into the night, 
The wind is at my back. 
Although petrified, 
The dreams that many can't outlast. 
So you think that life is just a game, 
But have you ever thought, 
With struggle comes lots of pain. 
Now you know what I'm talking about, 
You feel it running through your veins, don't you? 
Oh, the feelings many must ignore... 
All my life I have tried 
To overcome this empty side of my mind. 
Ooh never run, 'cause you can't hide. 
Now it seems you call out. 
Test My Will of all mankind, 
Youth you test me 
In all these words, 
Somebody must have heard them. 
This bleeding heart that's mine, 
Somewhere it must start. 
Now it seems, 
All of us are here... 
We move in the same way. 
Now it seems, 
All our feelings are dear. 
We move in the same way up. 
We move in the same way up. 
Now it seems you call out... 
Youth you test me 
In all these words, 
Somebody must have heard them. 
This bleeding heart that's mine, 
Somewhere, it must start... 
Test My Will... 
Of all man kind,

[Part III: The Distant Light]

Thirty-six months have past along, 
And during this time... 
We struggled on, and struggled on. 
Exhaling pain. 
Paving roads in the mind 
Since we were young. 
Now we'll make the dreams 
Come alive through you 
For the answer lies inside 
Open your mind and we'll find 
That it's easier 
Well, if I could turn back time 
I'd replay the memories left behind 
Then change the way I am 
Although life has scarred my heart 
A piece of me still burns bright inside 
With hopes that I will find it (The Dreams I Have at night) 
Only time will tell what lies ahead 
Only you can fill the page of life 
So we raise our heads high 
As we close our eyes 
We'll begin to run as fast as we can 
Into the night 
We sit and we wait for judgement 
We sit and we wait judgement soon 
So we'll raise our heads high 
As we close our mind 
We'll begin to run as fast as 
We can into the night 
Now it seems you call out 
Test my will 
Of all mankind, youth you test me 
In all these words 
Somebody must have heard them 
This bleeding heart that's mine 
Somewhere it must start 
Please show me the way home
