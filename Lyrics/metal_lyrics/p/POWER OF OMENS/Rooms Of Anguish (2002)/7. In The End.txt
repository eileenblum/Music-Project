Take a good look now in my eyes.
You see the blasphemy,
Like you've never seen it before.
I know now if you tried,
You might not understand, 
You might not...
You might not understand me...No!!!

Now that you've seen what's in my eyes,
The world is calling you.
You think it's all in your head.

Look and seek, you'll find some sort of Happiness entombed by fear.
I could never dig that far.
I try with all my might.
Listen to me, 
Millions died for this word...
"Amen"
I cannot die in here, please don't let me Die alone...that's my biggest fear.

The World is not dieing, 
Another man's trying to prove to
All man that this cannot happen Again...no
So many turned faces
From all human races deny what they Might, it all comes back
In the end...yeah!!!

Seek your sacrifice and 
Hold it to the sky. 
Take some bad advise and 
Crush it to the ground.
Seek your sacrifice and 
You shall never die.

Millions died for this word...
"Amen"
I cannot die in here, please don't let me die alone...that's my biggest fear.

The World is not dieing, 
Another man's trying to prove to
All man that this cannot happen Again...no
So many turned faces
From all human races deny what they Might, it all comes back
In the end

[Guitar Solo]

Through my own personal sacrifice, 
Throughout all these years...I give.
Here is my soul.

Don't bring your faith on me, 
Like you always do.
Don't try to change my way of life.
You will always fail miserably.
Millions died for their faith.
"Amen"
I cannot die in here, please don't let me die alone...'cause that's my biggest fear.

The World is not dieing, 
Another man's trying to prove to
All man, that this cannot happen Again...no
So many turned faces,
From all human races deny what they Might, it all comes back
In the end...(Please don't leave me here)

[Instrumental]

Take the world into your hands,
Your body still, the mind in trance.
Feel the warmth within your soul.
This is where no one else can go.
