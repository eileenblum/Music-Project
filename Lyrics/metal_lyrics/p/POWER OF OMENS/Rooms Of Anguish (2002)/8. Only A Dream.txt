Things I've seen, the life that I lived
Down that road, so long ago.
When life was a simple lesson, 
A passionate seed to grow.

So now I grow to realize the dreams inside are tainted and affray...
They will never go away.

The dreams I have at night.
They seem to fill the air.
I'm running down the street but I 
Can't seem to find my friends.

So now I grow to realize the dreams inside are tainted and affray...
They will never go away.

Why should it be so hard? 
To remember the way it was.
For now, I'll just live and dream
This lie, till I die...I'll ask why.

[Guitar Solo]

They will never go away.

Seems that I could never find, 
Now that I am torn...

So now I grow to realize the dreams inside are tainted and affray...
They will never go away.

For now, I'll just live and dream
This lie I am.
