Bleed, 
For a sea of change is overflowing.
I've bled this all my life.
Pretending you would tell me, 
And maybe...
Show me, and tell me the truth.
Bestow what is real, are you real?

All my life I was taught to analyze.
My changes from deep within, 
Are you within?
Tell me lies; tell me a story of sacrifice,
The day you gave your life.

Take, this my son,
You don't have to fight 
This battle anymore.
No more nightmares.
And who are you to tell me, that
I am wrong.
When all I have done, is do 
My best to be...
A good man.

Why oh why? Must I pay such a price?
While my heart belongs.
See through my soul; touch the tears from my eyes.
And taste if you will,
Taste my desire.
The blood flows just as yours,
Just a slightly different direction.

All my life I was taught to analyze.
The changes from deep within, 
Are you within?
Tell me lies; tell me a story of sacrifice,
The day you gave your life.

Take, this my son,
You don't have to 
Fight this battle anymore.
No nightmares.
And who are you to tell me, that

I am wrong.
When all I have done, is do 
My best to be...
A good man.

Please save my soul...
And my life.

In a repetitious life, 
We follow like sheep.
Sometimes, with an aimless objective.
All this time I've tried to make 
All happy in my life, 
Now it's time for me, it's time for me...

Take, this my son,
You don't have to 
Fight this battle anymore.
No more nightmares.
And who are you to tell me, that
I am wrong.
When all I have done, is do 
My best to be...
And who are you to tell me, that 
I am wrong.
When all I have done, is do 
My best to be...
A good man.
