Take my hand; I'll guide the way.
I'll guide the way
Step by step, and side by side,
We walk together, we walk together...
Don't be afraid.

Slowly I push open the door.
A beautiful blue sky,
An ocean so calm
The brightest sun I've ever seen
My vision abstracted by the water's reflection.

Then suddenly a man appears
Along the horizon.

Then a voice said, "With all your fears and 
Questions set aside."
Then a voice said, "I cry these tears so you won't have to hide.
No matter where you are, I'm always here for you."

Then I noticed the man walking on water,
His face so pure, his eyes so deep.
With a smile, he reached out his hand to me.
Apprehensive, I put my hand to him.
Such gentle hands, my blood pressure dropped.
Then I found myself standing on water.

Welcome, now you're in my Rooms of Anguish.
It feels like make believe,
That I can't ever find it, 
The peace I've sought for years.

Has it happened to you, or is it just me.
Sometimes it tears me apart.
It brings me to my knees; it brings me to my knees,

Don't be afraid, I am always here.
I will never leave your side.
Take my hand you will never die.
Believe me...

In all my dreams, I never thought that
I would ever question celestial mind.
But now that's where I stand.
Decipher my words, and take from them what you will.

Welcome, now you're in my Rooms of Anguish.
It feels like make believe,
That I can't ever find it, 
The peace I've sought for years.

Has it happened to you, or is it just me.
Sometimes it tears me apart.
It brings me to my knees; it brings me to my knees.

Friends, some say, I understand...
(So why do you do this)
I'm the only one who knows, 
So why does it even matter to you.
Is this one the only one?
From which the pain has started.

We will find the truth together.
Feel deep, inside your soul, 
Feel deep, inside me...find.

Now as we all understand, 
The reasons behind all the fears we hide.
Tell me, tell me they say...
It's just so hard; it's just so hard,
It's just so damn hard....

Then a voice said, "With all your fears and 
Questions set aside."
Then a voice said, "I cry these tears so you don't have to hide.
No matter where you are, 
I'm always here for you."
Across the sea, and on all land

Just follow your heart, 
And be the man that you'll be
And let no one tell you differently.
With all my heart I trust faithfully.

Welcome, now you're in my Rooms of Anguish.
It feels like make believe,
That I can't ever find it, 
This peace I've sought for years.

Has it happened to you, or is it just me.
Sometimes it tears me apart.
It brings me to my knees; it brings me to my knees.
