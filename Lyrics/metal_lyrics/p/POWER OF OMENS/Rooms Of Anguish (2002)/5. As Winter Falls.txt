As darkness falls upon, 
I can see ahead.
The snow falls from a blackened sky.
As winter falls...

Watching the clouds drift away slowly,
Awaiting the coldest point of night.

I'll do my best to 
Warm my bones by the fire.
Listen to the howl of the wind
Getting stronger and stronger.

My life, I'll sacrifice.
Is it worth to feel this way?
My life is growing stronger.
My life, I'll sacrifice.
Is it worth to feel this way?
My life is growing stronger.

As Winter Falls, it falls, 
As Winter Falls

My life is for no one...

Let me come along, 
I'll be there 'till the end.
Let me come along, 
I'll follow 'till the end.
Please oh Please....
No, don't walk away,
And leave me where I stand.
Erosion taking place with every gust of wind to hit my face, 
A part of my soul, 
Released from body...no
Just let me go.

My life, I'll sacrifice.
Is it worth to feel this way?
My life is growing stronger.
My life, I'll sacrifice.
Is it worth to feel this way?
My life is growing stronger.

As Winter Falls, it falls,
As Winter Falls

Listen to the sound of
My heart pounding.
Adrenaline intensifies,
With every second passing.
Why should I be so ashamed? 
To ask for mercy...
Show the light I'll find the way, 
I'll find the way.

My life is for no one else, except for me and my God.
