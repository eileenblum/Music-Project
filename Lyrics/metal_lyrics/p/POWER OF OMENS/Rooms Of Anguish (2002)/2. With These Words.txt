Wake up, you are here with me
In my dream.
Upon a mountain of uncertainty.
I will fly to the bottom of my soul.
My heart torn, between two worlds.
NO!!!!! 
I will not deceive the good in my own memory.

Some may say, the life I live is wrong.
And if so, he without sin cast the first stone.

Put your hands together.
Bow your head, and ask forgiveness.
With these words, I save my soul 
(With these words...)
In the end, the truth shall be known.
The truth shall be known...

My body burns with faith.
My soul, a counter clockwise spin.

With these hands, I'll carve my future
To the blueprints of self-righteous man.

No I will not deceive, the good in my memory
No I will not deceive, the good in my memory

Put your hands together.
Bow your head, and ask forgiveness.
With these words, I save my soul 
(With these words...)
In the end, the truth shall be known.

[Instrumental]
[Solo]

Wasted years and wasted time, 
The philosophy not just mine.

Put your hands together.
Bow your head, and ask forgiveness.
With these words, I save my soul 
(With these words...)
In the end, the truth shall be known
Put your hands together.
Bow your head, and ask forgiveness.
With these words, I save my soul 
(With these words...)
In the end, the truth shall be known

No I will not deceive, the good in my own memory
No I will not deceive, the good in my own memory.
