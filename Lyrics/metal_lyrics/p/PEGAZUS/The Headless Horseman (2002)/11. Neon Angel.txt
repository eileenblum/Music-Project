She left home at fifteen, searching for the dream
Small town girl so innocent, a stranger to the scene
Attracted to the shimmering lights, like a moth drawn to a flame
Runaway to the cities scorn, a young girls lust for fame

Blinded by the spotlight, the stars shine in your eyes
You walk the walk and talk the talk, but I can hear you cries
Just another lost soul, your livin' a lie
The streets are a lonely path, where broken dreams will die

Neon angel, life was all a dream
Neon angel, it just ain't what it seems
Neon angel, your livin' a lie
Neon angel, I still hear your cries

A surrogate of the wildside, a temptress of the night
Innocence lost in a heartbeat, in the Hollywood lights
Silverscreen starlett, seeking her golden dream
Won't be too long now, before she is crowned Queen

Blinded by the spotlight, the stars shine in your eyes
You walk the walk and talk the talk, but I can hear you cries
Just another lost soul, your livin' a lie
The streets are a lonely path, where broken dreams will die

I see the solutide in your eyes, the face of despair
Covering up your little white lies, fortune and fame ain't here
Keep yourself together, till the night comes again
Hollywood dreams shattered, shot down in flames

Blinded by the spotlight, the stars shine in your eyes
You walk the walk and talk the talk, but I can hear you cries
Just another lost soul, your livin' a lie
The streets are a lonely path, where broken dreams will die

Neon angel, life was all a dream
Neon angel, it just ain't what it seems
Neon angel, your livin' a lie
Neon angel, I still hear your cries
