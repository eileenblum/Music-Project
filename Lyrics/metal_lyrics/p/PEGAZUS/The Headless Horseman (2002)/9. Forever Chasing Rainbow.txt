The storm, is coming our way
I can see the rain
It's falling down again
Grey clouds, clouds of anger rise
As the thunder lights the skies
And the rainbow goes to hide

I'll never see the sunlight
I'll never feel the same again
I'll never reach the stars
I'll never quite get that far

I, I see the terror in it's eye
The force of winds will deny
The spirit is alive
But I, I just want to fly
And tear up the night
Burning up the skies

I'll never see the sunlight
I'll never feel the same again
I'll never reach the stars
I'll never quite get that far

On my, white winged horse tonight
I just want to ride
And tear up the night
Oh I'm, searching for the gold
A tale from long ago
Forever chasing rainbows

I'll never see the sunlight
I'll never feel the same again
I'll never reach the stars
I'll never quite get that far
