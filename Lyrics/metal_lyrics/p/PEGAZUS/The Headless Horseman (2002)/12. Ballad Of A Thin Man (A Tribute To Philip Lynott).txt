He went down down to Chinatown
A Killer on the Loose is what he found
Fighting his way back like a Wild One
But Johnny the Fox he had a loaded gun
He broke out in a Cold, Cold Sweat
Another Bad Habit he could never forged
With a Whisky Jar still in his hand
Jimmy the Weed he has a nervous wreck

They say last night, there was a Jailbreak
Don't believe a word
The Man is back in town, you must have heard

This is The Ballad of a Thin Man
A Cowboy, The Warrior
A Renegade, The Black Rose
A Moonlight Dancing Romeo

He knew an Angel from the Coast
Running Back to the lonely girl
This cowboy was headed Southbound
To Hollywood before The Sun Goes Down
Word got out the Man was Back In Town
His Bad Reputation had got around
Johnny and Rocky lookin' high and low
Are You Ready now for the Black Rose

They say last night, there was a Jailbreak
Don't believe a word
The Man is back in town, you must have heard

This is ThÃ£ Ballad of a Thin Man
A Cowboy, The Warrior
A Renegade, The Black Rose
A Moonlight Dancing Romeo

They say last night, there was a Jailbreak
Don't believe a word
The Man is back in town, you must have heard

This is ThÃ£ Ballad of a Thin Man
A Cowboy, The Warrior
A Renegade, The Black Rose
A Moonlight Dancing Romeo
This is ThÃ£ Ballad of a Thin Man
A Cowboy, The Warrior
A Vagabond, A Fighter
The Emerald Isle's Rockin' Renegade
