I can see the rainbow in the sky
The gateway to the clouds after the rain
The storm has passed and serenity arrives
Where can it take us now?

Spread your wings and fly
Up to the heavens
Where the clouds pass us by
Spread your wings and fly
Climbing the skies
Where lightning once would strike

I feel the change is coming now
I feel the wind blowing a gale
I see the clouds are drifting apart
I see the sky turning to grey

Spread your wings and fly
Up to the heavens
Where the clouds pass us by
Spread your wings and fly
Climbing the skies
Where lightning once would strike
