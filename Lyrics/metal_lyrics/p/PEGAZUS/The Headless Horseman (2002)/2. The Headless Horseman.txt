On a night of rain and thunder, the curse will live again
Awoken from his ancient slumber, the legends comes alive
The fullmoon shows his silhouette, shadow in the sky
As he rides through the woods, he comes for you tonight

Heads will roll
Can you hear the thunder, raging from down under
Heads will roll
When the horseman comes, and the lightning strikes
Heads will roll
When he strikes his sword, you'll feet his wrath of anger
Heads will roll
When the headless horseman finds you

The haunted forest comes alive, as another victim dies
His horse, galloping like a beast, driven by the blood of enemies
When the night falls down, the horsemen seeks his revenge
The cold misty night has come, and the moon turns to blood red

Heads will roll
Can you hear the thunder, raging from down under
Heads will roll
When the horseman comes, and the lightning strikes
Heads will roll
When he strikes his sword, you'll feet his wrath of anger
Heads will roll
When the headless horseman finds you

Can you see him, he has risen from the dead
The evil and wicked, horsemen without a head
Seeking his vengeance, the scent of fear is on you
The hesan is coming, and tonight he comes for you

Heads will roll
Can you hear the thunder, raging from down under
Heads will roll
When the horseman comes, and the lightning strikes
Heads will roll
When he strikes his sword, you'll feet his wrath of anger
Heads will roll
When the headless horseman finds you

Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
