I ride the winds that howl
And bring down the rain
Thunder and lightning strikes
Across the desert plains
I ride alone at night
On my white winged horse
As the roaring sounds come from
The heavens above 

Take me through into the night
Guide my way with your bright light
My source of life is in your eyes
Worshipped by millions of lonely cries 

Wings of Steel, Take me higher
Take me to the clouds
Where the lightning strikes
And the thunder roar is loud
Wings of Steel, Take me there
So I can be set free
To fly across the universe
To seek my Destiny 

A loud thunder crack
&gt;From the heavens above
Sends me and my horse
Plummeting towards the earth
We regain our course and fly
Away from the storm
But it's still racing upon us
With great ferocious force 

Take me through into the night
Guide my way with your bright light
My source of life is in your eyes
Worshipped by millions of lonely cries 

Wings of Steel, Take me higher
Take me to the clouds
Where the lightning strikes
And the thunder roar is loud
Wings of Steel, Take me there
So I can be set free
To fly across the universe
To seek my Destiny 

[Solo]

We escape and reach the ancient
City of Cairo
A sacred place in Egypt
The land of the Pharaohs
But again the thunder breaks
Above these grey clouds
An electric storm of fire
Strikes from the Egyptian Gods 

Take me through into the night
Guide my way with your bright light
My source of life is in your eyes
Worshipped by millions of lonely cries 

Wings of Steel, Take me higher
Take me to the clouds
Where the lightning strikes
And the thunder roar is loud
Wings of Steel, Take me there
So I can be set free
To fly across the universe
To seek my Destiny 

Wings of Steel, Take me higher
Take me to the clouds
Where the lightning strikes
And the thunder roar is loud
Wings of Steel, Take me there
So I can be set free
To fly across the universe
To seek my Destiny 

Wings of Steel - Set me free...
