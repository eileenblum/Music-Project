If you would just look into my eyes
I'll show you a place called paradise
And you'll feel better, better than before
I'll take you higher than you've ever gone
The grass is blue and the sky is red
And the trees shine all silver and gold
Fairies and elves live in this world
This Enchanted World 

If you want it - I've got it
I'll give it all to you - I'll show you
A place where - All your dreams will come true
If you want it - I have got it
I will give it all to you - I'll show you
A place where - All your dreams will come true 

If you'll only take the chance
I'm talkin' about adventure not romance
It's and Enchanted World far away
And if you like it you can stay
The grass is blue and the sky is red
And the trees all shine silver and gold
Fairies and elves live in this world
This Enchanted World 

If you want it - I've got it
I'll give it all to you - I'll show you
A place where - All your dreams will come true
If you want it - I have got it
I will give it all to you - I'll show you
A place where - All your dreams will come true 

The stars are a purple and they shine all day
In this peaceful Enchanted World you can stay
Streams of silver and oceans of gold
And no one here ever grows old...
Enchanted World 

[Solo]
