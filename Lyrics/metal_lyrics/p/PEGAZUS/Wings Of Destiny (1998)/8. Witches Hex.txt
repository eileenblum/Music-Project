On a hill in a forest far away
There's a cottage that people always talk and say
Has been there for five hundered years
And the wicked witch lives there today
I was curious to see with my own eyes
If the story was true so I went to find
The cottage on the hill far away
Where the wicked witch still lives today 

Witches Hex - Got me in a spell
Witches Hex - Evil straight from hell
Witches Hex - Got me in her spell
Witches Hex - Black magic from hell 

Witches Hex - Got me in a spell
Witches Hex - Evil straight from hell
Witches Hex - Got me in her spell
Witches Hex - Black magic from hell 

I went to the forest and searched around
A cottage on the hill is what I found
I was walking down the dusty path
And closer to the cottage I heard her laugh
I started to run back to the woods
With my heart racin' faster than my legs ever could
The witch she heard me stumble and fall
And that's when she cast her evil spell 

Witches Hex - Got me in a spell
Witches Hex - Evil straight from hell
Witches Hex - Got me in her spell
Witches Hex - Black magic from hell
Witches Hex - Got me in a spell
Witches Hex - Evil straight from hell
Witches Hex - Got me in her spell
Witches Hex - Black magic from hell 

There is an old lady
That lives down the road
She lives in this cottage
With her cats and toads
And when the night falls
You can hear a strange noise
You can hear her chanting spells
In an eerie spooky voice 

[Solo]

Witches Hex - Got me in a spell
Witches Hex - Evil straight from hell
Witches Hex - Got me in her spell
Witches Hex - Black magic from hell 

Witches Hex - Got me in a spell
Witches Hex - Evil straight from hell
Witches Hex - Got me in her spell
Witches Hex - Black magic from hell
