He was born with a heart of a lion
He was born under the rising sun
His father was a great Indian brave
And so, that's how he got his name 

Braveheart - He was a warriors son
Braveheart - Afraid of no one
Braveheart - He was born to rule
For his tribe, people and their land 

He would seek and learn from his elders
As he grew to be a young brave man
By the day he would hunt and capture his prey
By night he'd call the spirits in the clouds 

Braveheart - He was a warriors son
Braveheart - Afraid of no one
Braveheart - He was born to rule
For his tribe, people and their land 

[Solo]

Braveheart - He was a warriors son
Braveheart - Afraid of no one
Braveheart - He was born to rule
For his tribe, people and their land 

As he looked into the starry night
He could see the vision of his great old father
And the voices of wisdom he would hear
And his ancestors told him to stand against fear 

Braveheart - He was a warriors son
Braveheart - Afraid of no one
Braveheart - He was born to rule
For his tribe, people and their land
For his tribe, people and their land
For his tribe - People - And their land
