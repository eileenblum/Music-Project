The full moon's out for all to see
The Werewolf's coming out to feed
So you better hide
Somewhere tonight
There's an evil feeling in the air
You can't help feeling so damn scared
And you don't know
Where to go 

He's howling, he's growling
The Werewolf can smell your blood
He'll bite you, he'll taste you
The Werewolf is coming to get you 

You run away and try to hide
But he sees you in his sights
Don't look back
Just run fast
Now you have to kill the beast
Destroy the evil that's unleashed
'Cause he wants you
Don't let him get you 

He's howling, he's growling
The Werewolf can smell your blood
He'll bite you, he'll taste you
The Werewolf is coming to get you 

[Solo]

Get your gun and shoot him down
With a silver bullet he'll hit the ground
It's the only way
Don't be afraid
In a pool of blood he lies
As the Werewolf slowly dies
Now he's dying
He's dying 

He's howling, he's growling
The Werewolf can smell your blood
He'll bite you, he'll taste you
The Werewolf is coming to get you 

He's coming to get you!
