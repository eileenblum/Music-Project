Your life is full of problems
You don't know what to do
Just make your own decision
The choice is up to you
Don't worry what people say
They'll try and put you down
Just do what you believe in
With both feet on the ground 

You're living life like a rolling dice
Take a throw and don't think twice
You're trying hard, just to survive
You keep on playing not to lose 

You gotta Cry Out, Cry Out
If you feel you wanna scream
Cry Out, Cry Out
Don't let it get to you
Cry Out, Cry Out
The future's in your hands
Cry Out, Cry Out
It's time to make a stand 

Knocked down, kicked to the ground
Nobody even cares
Look out and watch your step
Or you might fall down again
Your mind is kind of jaded
Confused and twisted thoughts
Your world is crashing down
You'll find you're not alone 

You're living life like a rolling dice
Take a throw and don't think twice
You're trying hard, just to survive
You keep on playing not to lose 

You gotta Cry Out, Cry Out
If you feel you wanna scream
Cry Out, Cry Out
Don't let it get to you
Cry Out, Cry Out
The future's in your hands
Cry Out, Cry Out
It's time to make a stand 

[Solo]

They'll take a little piece
They'll take what they can get
A little is never enough
To satisfy them yet
Greed is their hunger
They want total control
You've got the power to face it
It's alive in your soul 

You're living life like a rolling dice
Take a throw and don't think twice
You're trying hard, just to survive
You keep on playing not to lose 

You gotta Cry Out, Cry Out
If you feel you wanna scream
Cry Out, Cry Out
Don't let it get to you
Cry Out, Cry Out
The future's in your hands
Cry Out, Cry Out
It's time to makea stand
You've got to
Cry Out...
