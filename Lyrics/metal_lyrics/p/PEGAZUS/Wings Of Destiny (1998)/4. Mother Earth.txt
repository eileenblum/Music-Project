Mother Earth is dying
There are people crying
Where will it lead us?
Where will we go?
Nobody knows 

Why let her die?
Why choose to destroy her?
She gave us all we need
Now it's ruined by
Temptation and greed 

Watching the sky turn to grey
People are dying every day
Toxins in the air to no despair
The air that we breathe gets worse every year 

Mother Earth is dying - Can't you hear her crying?
She's crying - Crying 

The world it turns but suffers slow
Not many care or even know
But soon the day, the day will come
When it is all, all too late 

Mother Earth is dying - Can't you hear her crying?
She's crying - Crying 

[Solo]

Mother Earth is dying - Can't you hear her crying?
She's crying - Crying 

Spoken words of peace are just a lie to me
You hear it all the time, it's a God damn crime
Can't you hear her, how the wind cries?
Can't you see her, the colour of her skies? 

Mother Earth is dying - Can't you hear her crying?
She's crying, She's crying
Crying, Crying, Crying, Crying
