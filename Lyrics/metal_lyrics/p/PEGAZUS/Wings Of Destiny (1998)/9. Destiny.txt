I know one day we'll find
For what we've been searchin' all this time
It can't be too far away now
Cause we've been tryin' for so long
For so long, for so long
And a chance is all it takes
With wings we can reach a dream 

Tonight we're gonna fly
We're gonna spread our wings tonight
We're gonna try and reach the sky
You know we've gotta try - Tonight, tonight
Cause we've gotta reach the stars
Yeah we've gotta reach the stars - Tonight, tonight 

And nothing can change the way
Cause it was meant to be
It's something we strongly believe in
Because it's our Destiny 

[Solo]

Tonight we're gonna fly
We're gonna spread our wings tonight
We're gonna try and reach the sky
You know we've gotta try
Tonight, tonight
Cause we've gotta reach the stars
Yeah we've gotta reach the stars
Tonight, tonight, tonight 

And nothing can change the way
Cause it was meant to be
It's something we strongly believe in
Because it's our DESTINY...
