We are not alone
On this earth that we call home
Flying across the skies at night
Are silver beams of light
Visitors from afar
From a distant shining star
Travel across the universe
To see who we are.

The sun revolves around us
We revolve around the sun
The solar system is endless
And who really knows, just where it ends?
Man has walked onto the moon
We have launched rockets into space
Stargazing for many centuries
But we still don't know everything

Chariots of the Gods
They've been watching the earth
Chariots of the Gods
From a distant universe
Chariots of the Gods
We can't escape their watching eyes
Solar system angels
They're watching you and I

Back in the days of the Pharaohs
They saw many visions in the sky
In the night skies they were shining
Gods they saw in silver chariots
Flying high over the pyramids
Solar system angels light up the night
The Pharaohs raise their hands to the heavens
Worshipping the silver god

Chariots of the Gods
They've been watching the earth
Chariots of the Gods
From a distant universe
Chariots of the Gods
We can't escape their watching eyes
Solar system angels
They're watching you and I
Watching you and I.

[Solo]

Now we still feel their presence
We have seen them with our own eyes
Coming down to earth and watching us
Why it is, we may never know
Too many sightings of aliens
Governments deny that they exist
Hiding facts from the rest of us
Why can't the truth just be known?

Chariots of the Gods
They've been watching the earth
Chariots of the Gods
From a distant universe
Chariots of the Gods
We can't escape their watching eyes
Solar system angels
They're watching you and I

Watching you and I.
