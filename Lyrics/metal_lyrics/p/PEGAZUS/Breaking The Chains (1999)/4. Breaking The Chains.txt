We've got the power
We are in control
We are united
For heavy Rock'n'Roll
We're strong believers
Of the Heavy Metal faith
Heavy Metal lives
We'll show them we are right

We're Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Metal for me, it's all that I breathe
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Can you feel it, Metal for you.

The Metal Spirit
Is Forever Free
Courage and strength
Inside of you and me
We won't surrender
Our fight will never end
We'll take no prisoners
Your choice is made my friend

Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Metal for me, it's all that I breathe
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Can you feel it, Metal for you.

Breaking the Chains
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the Chains

[Solo]

The beast is rising
Back for the fatal blow
Rise above the blackest skies
We'll stand on our own
Ready for the battle
In leather, denim and studs
Freedom and fire
It's the only life we know

We're Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Metal for me, it's all that I breathe
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Can you feel it, Metal for you

Breaking the Chains
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the Chains

Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Can you feel it, Metal for you
Breaking the Chains
Breaking the rules
Metal for me, Metal for you
