Through the wastelands and the hills
The battle has begun
Surprise attack our enemies
We'll fight till there's not one
We ride to the battlefields
With our swords and our shields
Our horses racing to the hills
Across to the Viking lands

We fight, together in war
Brothers stand as one
And never surrender
Until we shed blood
Where the heroes fight and fall
Bravest warriors standing tall
Never surrender
Never give in

Hear the agony and the battlecries
Of a thousand men who slowly die
Their lives they have sacrificed
In the fields of no return
Death and hatred to mankind
The gods are a witness to our crime
The march to death is done
One for all and all for one

We fight, together in war
Brothers stand as one
And never surrender
Until we shed blood
Where the heroes fight and fall
Bravest warriors standing tall
Never surrender
The Crusade.

[Solo]

Out in the bloodied fields
They raise their mighty swords and their shields
Where the heroes fought and heroes died
The bravest warriors, and those who survived
The Crusade

We fight, together in war
Brothers stand as one
And never surrender
Until we shed blood
Where the heroes fight and fall
Bravest warriors standing tall
Never surrender
We fight, together in war
Brothers stand as one
And never surrender
Until we shed blood
Where the heroes fight and fall
Bravest warriors standing tall
Never surrender
The Crusade.
Never surrender, the Crusade
Never surrender, the Crusade
Never surrender, the Crusade
Never surrender, the Crusade
Never surrender, the Crusade
