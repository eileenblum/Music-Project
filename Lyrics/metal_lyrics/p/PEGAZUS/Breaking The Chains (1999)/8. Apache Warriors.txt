The cavalry storm the Indian grounds
The Apache tribe hear the thunderous sounds
Awaiting the battle and ready to go
Apache's ready with arrows and bows

Ablaze with gunfire the battle begins
Indians fighting a war they must win
The open fields are a battleground
Apache Indians surrounded all 'round

Apache Warrior fight for your tribe
Fight for your people be willing to die
Fight like a warrior, fight for your life
Apache Warrior prepare to die

No chance for escape it's murder at stake
Apache Warrior's still standing their ground
Cavalry too strong with three thousand men
Much too greater, the battle's at end

Apache Warrior fight for your tribe
Fight for your people be willing to die
Fight like a warrior, fight for your life
Apache Warrior prepare to die

[Solo]

The Apache's outnumbered the cavalry wins
Killing 'em all, they fought to win
Women and children all slaughtered and dead
Cavalry men be off with your heads

Apache Warrior fight for your tribe
Fight for your people be willing to die
Fight like a warrior, fight for your life
Apache Warrior prepare to die

Geronimo.
Prepare to die!
