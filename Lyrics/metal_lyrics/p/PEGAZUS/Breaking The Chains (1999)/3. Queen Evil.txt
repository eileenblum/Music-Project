She's a black hearted woman
Black magic voodoo queen
So goddam wicked
The meanest bitch I've ever seen
Stay away, don't mess around
The feeling is quite clear
You're vicious, malicious
Don't tread without fear

The lady is evil
You can see it in her eyes
She'll smile at you with her wicked grin
She'll have you mesmerized

Queen Evil
Beware, or she will take your soul
Queen Evil
Watchout, before she gets a hold
Queen Evil
Why don't you just set me free?
Queen Evil
You don't wanna be messin' with me

Cruel, sadistic, evil woman
With torture on your mind
You take a heart and rip it out
You're an evil one of a kind
Feeding on human flesh
Like a deadly parasite
It's my blood I know you crave
It's what your black heart desires

The lady is evil
You can see it in her eyes
She'll smile at you with her wicked grin
She'll have you mesmerized

Queen Evil
Beware, or she will take your soul
Queen Evil
Watchout, before she gets a hold
Queen Evil
Why don't you just set me free?
Queen Evil
You don't wanna be messin' with me
No
