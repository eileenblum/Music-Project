Now the time is right
For Pegazus Warriors to unite
We stand together tall
Forever we will fight
Across the many wastelands
Across the seven seas
To unleash the metal beast
The one we all know

Restless and wild
Like the devil's child
We'll show the non believers

Metal Forever
The power drives us all insane
Metal Forever
We feel it, running through our veins
Metal Forever
Like thunder, shaking the sky
Metal Forever
The one for you and me

Listen for the thunder
The ancient gods are back
Giving us the power
Forever we are one
Just like the prodigal son
An outcast, the unholy one
Don't think to stop us
The beast is back again

Restless and wild
Like the devil's child
We'll show the non believers

Metal Forever
The power drives us all insane
Metal Forever
We feel it, running through our veins
Metal Forever
Like thunder, shaking the sky
Metal Forever
The one for you and me

[Solo]

Metal Forever
The power drives us all insane
Metal Forever
We feel it, running through our veins
Metal Forever
Like thunder, shaking the sky

Metal Forever
Metal Forever
The power 
Metal Forever
Drives us all insane
Metal Forever
Metal Forever
Metal..
