There's a spirit within us all
In darkness it can see
Unholy thoughts came from the devil
Humanity fails at last

Centuries of hatred
Our ending has begun
Drenched in bad blood
Earth awakens, end of nations

Tears of the Angels
Man's sins will be burned
Tears of the Angels
Earth's breath will be heard

The church have been misleading
The gospel, but failed to see
For what they preach will be forgotten
A greater sin there cannot be 

Centuries of hatred
Our ending has begun
Drenched in bad blood
Earth awakens, end of nations

Tears of the Angels
Man's sins will be burned
Tears of the Angels
Earth's breath will be heard

[Solo]

Tears of the Angels
Man's sins will be burned
Tears of the Angels
Earth's breath will be heard

There's a spirit within us all
In darkness it can see
Unholy thoughts came from the devil
Humanity fails at last

Centuries of hatred
Our ending has begun
Drenched in bad blood
Earth awakens, end of nations

Tears of the Angels
Man's sins will be burned
Tears of the Angels
Earth's breath will be
Tears of the Angels
Man's sins will be burned
Tears of the Angels
Earth's breath will be heard
