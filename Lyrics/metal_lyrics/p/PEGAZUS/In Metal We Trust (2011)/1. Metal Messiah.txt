The Metal Messiah
Rises up from the fire
Out from the ashes of doom
Like a Phoenix he's rising
Beyond the horizon
He's coming for me and for you
He gives power and strength
To the ones who believe
Ones who will stand up and fight
An unholy power
Born of blood and of fire
Fight for the right to unite

We have come - Here as one
To unite - Stand up and fight
We have come - Here as one
To unite - Stand up and fight

Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiah
Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiaaah

Out from the dark
Igniting the spark
Adding the fuel to the fire
Twisting and turning
While the fires are burning
Blazing right out of control
He gives power and strength
To the ones who believe
Ones who will stand up and fight
An unholy power
Born of blood and of fire
Fight for the right to unite

We have come - Here as one
To unite - Stand up and fight
We have come - Here as one
To unite - Stand up and fight

Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiah
Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiaaah

Bangin' your head
Whippin' your hair
Metal is our new religion
United we stand
Divided we fall
Metal is life to us all
He gives power and strength
To the ones who believe
Ones who will stand up and fight
An unholy power
Born of blood and of fire
Fight for the right to unite

We have come - Here as one
To unite - Stand up and fight
We have come - Here as one
To unite - Stand up and fight

Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiah
Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiaaah

Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiah
Metal Messiah - In Metal We Trust
Metal Messiaaah
