C'mon

Many years ago -
Something was born
Burning in us all
We live it - Breathe it
Fight, for the right
For us to unite
Now the stars align
It's pumping through the veins
The power is insane
Catch the metal train
Feel it - Breathe it
Raise up the dead
Come and bang your head
Rockin' till the end

Yeah, We Live To Rock
Hell we love to roll
Pump those fists higher
Till we lose control
Yeah, We Live To Rock
Hell we love to roll
Pump those fists higher
Till we lose control

Yeah, We Live To Rock
Turnin' back the clock
Never gonna stop
We live it - Breathe it
Turn it up to ten
Walls will break and bend
We ain't no trend
Like a lightning strike
We're lightning up the sky
Metal burning bright
We feel it - Breathe it
Like a rush of thunder
The spell I'm under
I just can't get enough

Yeah, We Live To Rock
Hell we love to roll
Pump those fists higher
Till we lose control
Yeah, We Live To Rock
Hell we love to roll
Pump those fists higher
Till we lose control

Yeah, We Live To Rock
Hell we love to roll
Pump those fists higher
Till we lose control
Yeah, We Live To Rock
Hell we love to roll
Pump those fists higher
Till we lose control
