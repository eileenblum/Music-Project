Johnny made a pact with the devil
In return for vengeance
To protect his one true love
She was his princess
At night he comes alive
A fireball on the road
Lighting up the  darkest night
Ready to explode

Watch out! Cause he's one hell of a sight

Ghost Rider - Tearing up the highway
Hell on two wheels
Ghost Rider - Midnight terrorizer
Seeking revenge

Roaring thunder down the road
No rest for the weary
He's gotta make the guilty pay
With his blind raging fury
The beast alive within his soul
Handing out salvation
Ready to take on the world
And settle scores

Watch out! Cause he's one hell of a sight

Ghost Rider - Tearing up the highway
Hell on two wheels
Ghost Rider - Midnight terrorizer
Seeking revenge
Ghost Rider - Gonna get his vengeance
He's gonna make you pay
Ghost Rider - You better count your blessings
Cause there's no escape

Ghost Rider - Tearing up the highway
Hell on two wheels
Ghost Rider - Midnight terrorizer
Seeking revenge

He rides to live
He lives to ride
To hand out his revenge
The demon living inside
If he's comin' to get you
You better run and hide
Nothing stands in his way
This evil mind

He's gonna give you - A hell of a fright!

Ghost Rider - Tearing up the highway
Hell on two wheels
Ghost Rider - Midnight terrorizer
Seeking revenge
Ghost Rider - Gonna get his vengeance
He's gonna make you pay
Ghost Rider - You better count your blessings
Cause there's no escape
