I look at you, you look at me
What the hell do you see?
Don't go messin' me around
Or soon you'll meet your maker

It's an Eye for an Eye - Tooth for a Tooth

Who do you think you are?
This time you've gone too far
I ain't playin' no more games
That's my revelation

It's an Eye for an Eye - Tooth for a Tooth

You're staring trouble in the eye
Sick and tired of all the lies
Will you never ever learn?
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

It's an Eye for an Eye - Tooth for a Tooth
It's an Eye for an Eye

Alright!

It's an Eye for an Eye - Tooth for a Tooth

You're staring trouble in the eye
Sick and tired of all the lies
Will you never ever learn?
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

It's an Eye for an Eye - Tooth for a Tooth
It's an Eye for an Eye
