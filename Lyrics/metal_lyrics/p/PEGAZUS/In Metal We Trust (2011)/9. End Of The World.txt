When the world turns to black
There ain't no turning back
Is this the End of the World
We're heading for a breakdown
A global warming meltdown
Is this the End of the World

It does seem I have a problem
Facing impending doom
I don't want to meet no prophet
Maybe he's coming soon
Some see the world on fire
Quaking and flooded doom
Your money and proud possessions
Will go up in smoke with you

When the world turns to black
There ain't no turning back
Is this the End of the World
We're heading for a breakdown
A global warming meltdown
Is this the End of the World

Fire in the sky
Then all the waters rise
Burning and drowning millions
They embrace the other side
Regret the past addictions
And all the judgment too
Your money and proud possessions
Will go up in smoke with you

When the world turns to black
There ain't no turning back
Is this the End of the World
We're heading for a breakdown
A global warming meltdown
Is this the End of the World

Global devastation
The last gasp for mankind
All your wealth and possessions
Mean nothing to you now

A world gone insane
And who the hell's to blame
Don't point your finger at me
Our earth is dying
Starving and crying
Who cares to make the change?

End of the World
End of the World
Is this the End of the World
End of the World
End of the World
Is this the End of the World
End of the World
End of the World
Is this the End of the World
End of the World
Is this the End of the World
