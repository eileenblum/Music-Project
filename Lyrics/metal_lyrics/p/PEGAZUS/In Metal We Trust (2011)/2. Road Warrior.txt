Fuel Injected Suicide Machine
Flick the Nitrous Oxide, Built for Speed

Wild dust storms, raging winds
Wolves howl in the night
Just another glory rider
Not afraid, afraid to die
I'm like a bolt of lightning
A flash from the sky
'Cause out in the wastelands
Only the strong, the strong survive

I'm on the highway - I own the road
I do it my way, it's the only way I know
I ride the beast - I ride the storm
I ride the winds that take me home

Feel the power of my mean machine
Roaring thunder sucking gasoline

My mind's in overdrive
Always on the edge
Day to day, night to night
It's what keeps me alive
All alone on a desolate highway
Just tryin' to survive
But when the sun goes down
I'm like a thief, a thief in the night

I'm on the highway - I own the road
I do it my way, it's the only way I know
I ride the beast - I ride the storm
I ride the winds that take me home

Nowhere to run
'Cause there's nowhere to hide
I await the reaper
I live to die another day

I'm on the highway (I'm on the highway)
I own the road (I own the road)
I do it my way, it's the only way I know
I ride the beast (I ride the beast)
I ride the storm (I ride the storm)
I ride the winds that take me home
