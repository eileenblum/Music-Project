I, feel the icy cold
Breath of a spirit
I don't want to know
The dark, is the place to hide
Hear the sound of footsteps
As they pass me by
I don't want to live
I don't want to be
A pawn to the evil
That's running around in here
My scream's empty
Someone save me
Why can't you hear me
Oh, someone hear me...

I hear the silence it's deafening me
Tearing and pulling my insecurities
Suddenly a door slam but nothing I see
I enter a basement to a sickening scream
The floor starts filling up with blood to my knees
I race up the stairwell
But something is following, is following
Something is following me

Is there
Anybody out there, Watching me
Save me
From this evil nightmare
Haunting me
Night falls
Shadows lurking around me
Save my soul
I'm calling
Out for someone, to set me free
Won't you come and set me free?

A demon like shadow is beckoning me
Frozen with fear as the walls start to bleed
Covering my body red is all I see
A hand on my forehead a cold chill embraces me
Something has joined me here in my body
It's turning me into something that
I don't - I don't want to
I don't - I don't want to be

Is there
Anybody out there, Watching me
Save me
From this evil nightmare
Haunting me
Night falls
Shadows lurking around me
Save my soul
I'm calling
Out for someone, to set me free
Won't you come and set me free?

I have lost all control
Something has taken my soul
I live in a blackened abyss
Why should I be suffering this
Something's controlling
Something's controlling me

Is there
Anybody out there, Watching me
Save me
From this evil nightmare
Haunting me
Night falls
Shadows lurking around me
Save my soul
I'm calling
Out for someone to set me
Set me free?
