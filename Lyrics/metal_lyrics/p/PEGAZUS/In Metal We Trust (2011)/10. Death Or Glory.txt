Today is a day filled with pride
Summon all the courage you hold deep inside
Some will stand, some will fall
Our leaders beckon us, we must heed the call

Tell me can you feel the fire burning from within
Time to fight for what is right, we live in peace again
Still they try to take us down
Never try to take us down
You can run but never hide you will all end up slain

Revenge is in our eyes
Arrows black the sky
Spill the blood of men
Victory for the king
Hear our battle cry
Running for their lives
In the end - They all will die

The battle rages on for many endless days
Sickening smell of death is floating through the smoky haze
Still they try to run away
Don't ever try to run away
In the end we'll catch you and detach you from this world

Revenge is in our eyes (Death or Glory)
Arrows black the sky
Spill the blood of men (Death or Glory)
Victory for the king
Hear our battle cry (Death or Glory)
Running for their lives
In the end - They all will die

Death or Glory
Death or Glory
Death or Glory
Death or Glory

Revenge is in our eyes
Arrows black the sky
Spill the blood of men
Victory for the king
Hear our battle cry
Running for their lives
In the end - They all will die

Their end is closing in our victory is near
Soon their last breath will be taken
We release all our fear
How dare you try to take our home
Nobody tries to take our home
The final words all of them heard
Before they met their fate

Revenge is in our eyes (Death or Glory)
Arrows black the sky
Spill the blood of men (Death or Glory)
Victory for the king
Hear our battle cry (Death or Glory)
Running for their lives
In the end - They all will die
