We've got the power
The burning desire
Nothings gonna stop us
Or stand in our way
We've got the passion
We are in control
Sold our soul to the devil
We've got Rock 'n' Roll

Old Skool Metal Dayz
Rockin' hard and ridin' free
Shout it out, let me hear you scream
Old Skool Metal Dayz
Power of the music, sets me free
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

The metal flame
Is always burning bright
It's what keeps the spirit
In us all so alive
Free like the wind
Raised fists in the air
This beast called Rock 'n' Roll
Is forever here to stay

Old Skool Metal Dayz
Rockin' hard and ridin' free
Shout it out, let me hear you scream
Old Skool Metal Dayz
Power of the music, sets me free
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

We've got the fire
The metal flame's alive
It was lit many years ago
Proud to keep it alright
Over the years
It's given us the strength
To carry on with courage
And a heart full of pride

Old Skool Metal Dayz
Rockin' hard and ridin' free
Shout it out, let me hear you scream
Old Skool Metal Dayz
Power of the music, sets me free
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Old Skool Metal Dayz
Rockin' hard and ridin' free
Shout it out, let me hear you scream
Old Skool Metal Dayz
Power of the music, sets me free
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Old Skool Metal Dayz
Rockin' hard and ridin' free
Shout it out, let me hear you scream
Old Skool Metal Dayz
Power of the music, sets me free
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
