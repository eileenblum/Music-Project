[J.Stoj]

Take a look into the crystal ball
Can you see the future at all
And what's on your mind
Are you living way behind
Has your life flashed past by your eyes
Have you felt what it's like to die
Is it just a feeling of being unsure
What the hell are you looking for 
HOLD ON TO THE PAST
LIFE'S MOVING WAY TOO FAST
I CAN'T SEE IT NOW
I STILL WONDER HOW WE GOT THIS FAR 
Take a walk down memory lane
Your past life was a dying shame
Can you still feel the pain
Ain't life just a game
Has your life flashed past by your eyes
Have you felt what it's like to die
Is it just a feeling of being unsure
What the hell are you looking for 
HOLD ON TO THE PAST
LIFE'S MOVING WAY TOO FAST
I CAN'T SEE IT NOW
I STILL WONDER HOW WE GOT THIS FAR 
When I was younger
Things seemed so innocent
And now that I'm older
Things ain't what they used to be
I'm all alone now
I can't escape the world I'm in
I'm feelin' lost inside myself
I'm feelin' like I'm someone else 
And now it's so lonely
Nothing ever took me by surprise
I have everything to live for
No, I'm not gonna die 
HOLD ON TO THE PAST
LIFE'S MOVING WAY TOO FAST
I CAN'T SEE IT NOW
I STILL WONDER HOW WE GOT THIS FAR
