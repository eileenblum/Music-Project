[J.Stoj]

Adrenalin's pumpin' through my veins
Blood's rushin' fast straight to my brain
Hit the stage with an almighty scream
Heavy Metal music is what I mean
See the faces in the crowd
Raise your fists screamin' loud
We play our music 'cause we are proud
No one's ever gonna put us down 
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE 
We travel around city to city
We play so loud we show no pity
If you like your music loud and mean
Raise your fists let us hear you scream
See the faces in the crowd
Raise your fists screamin' loud
We play our music 'cause we are proud
And no one's ever gonna put us down 
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE 
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE 
My heart's thumpin' and I'm out of control
Lost my mind but I ain't no fool
Live for the glory, I live for the road
We're a metal band and this is how it goes
See the faces in the crowd
Raise your fists screamin' loud
We play our music 'cause we are proud
No one's ever gonna put us down 
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE
I'M ON FIRE - BURNING UP INSIDE 
I'M ON FIRE
