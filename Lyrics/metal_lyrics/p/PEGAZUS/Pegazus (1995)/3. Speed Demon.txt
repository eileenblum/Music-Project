[J.Stoj]

She's a fire breathin' maniac
Ready to attack
She loves to get a little crazy
So don't you turn your back
She's always lookin' for adventure
So don't stand in her way
She can show you many things
If you let her go all the way 
SPEED DEMON
SHE'S SCREAMIN'
SHE'S GOIN' ALL THE WAY
SPEED DEMON
YOU GOT ME BLEEDIN'
I LOVE THE GAMES YOU PLAY 
She's a non stop party animal
No she ain't gonna sleep
She's a fast talkin' psychopath
Stomping with her feet
She's dancin' 'round like crazy
She creates a little scene
Friends to her are plenty
She's everybody's treat 
SPEED DEMON
SHE'S SCREAMIN'
SHE'S GOIN' ALL THE WAY
SPEED DEMON
YOU GOT ME BLEEDIN'
I LOVE THE GAMES YOU PLAY 
This girl she wants to rock
And now she's on a roll
She was born to have fun
No she ain't gonna fall
She is so damn wicked
Evil in her ways
No use tryin' to stop her
'Cause she's goin' all the way 
SPEED DEMON SHE'S SCREAMIN'
SHE'S GOIN' ALL THE WAY
SPEED DEMON
YOU GOT ME BLEEDIN'
I LOVE THE GAMES YOU PLAY
