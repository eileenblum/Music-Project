[J.Stoj]

Far across the rainbow
I'm looking across the sky
I'm trying to find you
I can't see where you are
Where are you my angel
I need you here with me
I once had a vision
That you were standing next to me 
CRY FOR THE ANGEL
CRY FOR MECRY FOR THE ANGEL
AND CRY FOR ME 
I don't want to live a life of shame
I've had enough of pain
My life it feels like I'm falling
Down into the pits of hell
Where are you my angel
I need you here with me
I need your spirit of guidance
Won't you please help me 
CRY FOR THE ANGEL
CRY FOR ME
CRY FOR THE ANGEL
CRY FOR ME
CRY FOR THE ANGEL
CRY FOR ME
CRY FOR THE ANGEL
AND CRY FOR ME 
From afar I hear
A distant cry for me
I see a bright light shining
Shining down on me
From above I cannot see
My soul is leaving
From my body
The angel has come for me
And now I feel I am free
The angel cries for me
Cries for me
Cries for me
Woah oh woah oh woah oh woah
Woah oh woah oh woah oh woah 
Cries for me
Cries for me
Cries for me
She cries 
For me
For me
She cries for me
