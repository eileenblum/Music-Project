[J.Stoj]

An ancient myth of long ago
About a white winged horse
A horse that had the powers
To fly like a bird 
PEGASUS 
He'd reach the clouds by the day
And at night he'd reach the stars
And gracefully flying about
He was called Pegasus 
PEGASUS 
Pegasus, Pegasus
Fly to me
I need you now, I want to fly
Won't you come for me
Pegasus, Pegasus
Spread your wings and fly
You have the grace and the power
Forever to the skies 
Now Zues was a ruler
The ruler of all gods
He decided to make Pegasus
A constellation of stars 
And now he is forever
The legend white winged horse
The one you see in the night
A group of stars in the universe 
PEGASUS 
The spirit of Pegasus
Shall never die.
