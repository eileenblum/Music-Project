[J.Stoj]

There are people that lie
And try to deceive you
Through words of the lord
They try and brainwash you
And they hope you will believe them
And follow them in their ways 
THE LORD, OUR FATHER AND THE HOLY GHOST
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE MOST
JESUS HIS SON HAS DIED ON THE CROSS
BELIEVE IN HIM AND HOPE IS NOT LOST 
With their facts they will try
Try and conceive you
Through words of their lord
They preach to reach you
And they hope you will believe them
And follow them in their ways 
THE LORD, OUR FATHER AND THE HOLY GHOST
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE MOST
JESUS HIS SON HAS DIED ON THE CROSS
BELIEVE IN HIM AND HOPE IS NOT LOST 
Don't you see the picture isn't clear
Stay away from something you don't believe
How can it be that this religion's for me
I don't understand something that lives on fear 
Follow our faith
The right path is ours
Like sheep they conform
You can't look back now
And they hope you will believe them
And follow them in their ways 
THE LORD, OUR FATHER AND THE HOLY GHOST
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE MOST
JESUS HIS SON HAS DIED ON THE CROSS
BELIEVE IN HIM AND HOPE IS NOT LOST 
False prophets it is told in the holy book
Will come to preach a very different view
They may seem to be just as me and you
But before you leap you must clearly take a look
That the devil can be a misguiding fool
And he will try and take you for that fool 
THE LORD, OUR FATHER AND THE HOLY GHOST
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE MOST
JESUS HIS SON HAS DIED ON THE CROSS
BELIEVE IN HIM AND HOPE IS NOT LOST
THE LORD, OUR FATHER AND THE HOLY GHOST
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE MOST
JESUS HIS SON HAS DIED ON THE CROSS
BELIEVE IN HIM AND HOPE IS NOT LOST 
JESUS
