[J.Stoj]

Soldier boy back on your feet
Don't stop till the enemy retreat
You signed your life away on the dotted line
I own you boy, now you are mine 
Now die for your country
Your country needs you
But if you come back home
No one will give a damn
You may have won a battle
But you haven't won the war 
SURRENDER YOUR FREEDOM
YOU BASTARDS OF WAR
THE KILLING OF TIME'S
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
GET OUT OF THE TRENCHES
AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN
YOU'RE A WAR MACHINE
DOES YOUR COUNTRY GIVE A DAMN - NO! 
Now you are a military fighter
You've got that killer instinct boy
You're a freedom fighter an instigator
So we're sending you to hell 
Now die for your country
Your country needs you
But if you come back home
No one will give a damn
You may have won a battle
But you haven't won the war 
SURRENDER YOUR FREEDOM
YOU BASTARDS OF WAR
THE KILLING OF TIME'S
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
GET OUT OF THE TRENCHES
AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN
YOU'RE A WAR MACHINE
DOES YOUR COUNTRY GIVE A DAMN - NO! 
Now die for your country
Your country needs you
But if you come back home
No one will give a damn
You may have won a battle
But you haven't won the war 
SURRENDER YOUR FREEDOM
YOU BASTARDS OF WAR
THE KILLING OF TIME'S
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
GET OUT OF THE TRENCHES
AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN
YOU'RE A WAR MACHINE
DOES YOUR COUNTRY GIVE A DAMN - NO! 
Fear in their eyes
Trembling all inside
As they hear of the wars
And the killing of time
Pillage the towns
And kill all the men
The women are raped
And children are slain
The poor have to sacrifice
Their lives for their nation
Their lives being meaningless
For this cruel operation
Another order, another lot
Of human infestation
Upon another's land
To bring home death and hatred. 
SURRENDER YOUR FREEDOM
YOU BASTARDS OF WAR
THE KILLING OF TIME'S
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
GET OUT OF THE TRENCHES
AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN
YOU'RE A WAR MACHINE
DOES YOUR COUNTRY GIVE A DAMN 
SURRENDER YOUR FREEDOM
YOU BASTARDS OF WAR
THE KILLING OF TIME'S
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
GET OUT OF THE TRENCHES
AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN
YOU'RE A WAR MACHINE
DOES YOUR COUNTRY GIVE A DAMN 
SURRENDER YOUR FREEDOM
YOU BASTARDS OF WAR
THE KILLING OF TIME'S
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
GET OUT OF THE TRENCHES
AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN
YOU'RE A WAR MACHINE
DOES YOUR COUNTRY GIVE A DAMN - NO! 
Country give a damn - No!
Country give a damn - No!
Country give a damn - No!
Country give a damn - No!
Country give a damn - No!
Country give a damn - No!
Country give a damn - No!
Country give a damn - No!
