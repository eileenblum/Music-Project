[J.Stoj]

Last night I had a dream
I had wings and I could fly away
I could see mountains and the sea
And what it was like to be free
Free as a bird in the sky
My wings would take me up so high 
Now I feel as though I'm floating away
Above the clouds in a different kind of way
I'm so high, I feel so free
I wish this was the way I could always be
Flying high above the sky, so high
Like a bird I'm up so high 
I'm looking down on the earth from far away
It looks so peaceful, I really want to stay
I can only wish that this was real
I wish this was the way I could always feel
Now and then I still dream that I can fly
With my wings taking me up so high.
