[J.Stoj]

A broken heart
It's broke in two
'Cause of a bitch
That looks like you
She was the one
She was my love
Now she is gone
Now all I've got is 
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY 
It's in my gut
It feels so sharp
Won't go away
It's here to stay
Don't wanna feel it
Feel this way
What can I do
It's here to stay 
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY 
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY 
You were my friend
Or so you said
I see it now
What friendship means
My back is turned
Knife in my back
You stuck it in
With words you say 
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY FRIEND
PAIN, PAIN, PAIN IS MY
IS MY FRIEND!
