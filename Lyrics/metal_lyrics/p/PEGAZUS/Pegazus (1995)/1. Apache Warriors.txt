[J.Stoj]

The cavalry storm the Indian grounds
The Apache tribe hear the thunderous sounds
Awaiting the battle and ready to go
Apache's ready with arrows and bows 
Ablaze with gunfire the battle begins
Indians fighting a war they must win
The open fields are a battleground
Apache Indians surrounded all 'round 
APACHE WARRIOR FIGHT FOR YOUR TRIBE
FIGHT FOR YOUR PEOPLE BE WILLING TO DIE
FIGHT LIKE A WARRIOR FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
APACHE WARRIOR PREPARE TO DIE 
No chance for escape it's murder at stake
Apache Warrior's still standing their ground
The cavalry's too strong with three thousand men
Much too greater the battle's at end 
APACHE WARRIOR FIGHT FOR YOUR TRIBE
FIGHT FOR YOUR PEOPLE BE WILLING TO DIE
FIGHT LIKE A WARRIOR FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
APACHE WARRIOR PREPARE TO DIE 
The Apache's outnumbered the cavalry wins
Killing 'em all they fought to win
And women and children all slaughtered and dead
Cavalry men be off with your heads 
APACHE WARRIOR FIGHT FOR YOUR TRIBE
FIGHT FOR YOUR PEOPLE BE WILLING TO DIE
FIGHT LIKE A WARRIOR FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
APACHE WARRIOR PREPARE TO DIE 
Geronimo 
Prepare to die !
