[J.Stoj]

I am as wild as a mountain lion
Never worried about losin' or dyin'
If I've got a problem, It's soon solved
'Cause I can't bottle 'em up for too long 
I GOTTA DO MY THING AND SAY MY PIECE
KEEPIN' QUIET JUST AIN'T ME
IF YOU HEAR ME YELLIN', SCREAMIN' LOUD
YOU BETTER WATCHOUT THE LION'S OUT 
Now you know what to listen for
It's loud and mean, It's the lion's roar
When disturbed and angered you'll hear
The king of the jungle to be feared 
I GOTTA DO MY THING AND SAY MY PIECE
KEEPIN' QUIET JUST AIN'T ME
IF YOU HEAR ME YELLIN', SCREAMIN' LOUD
YOU BETTER WATCHOUT THE LION'S OUT 
In his path you should not be
For a predator is all that he sees
You may not want to provoke him at all
But the law of the jungle is stand or fall 
Watchout - The lion's out
Watchout - The lion's out 
Now you know what to listen for
It's loud and mean, It's the lion's roar
When disturbed and angered you'll hear
The king of the jungle to be feared 
I GOTTA DO MY THING AND SAY MY PIECE
KEEPIN' QUIET JUST AIN'T ME
IF YOU HEAR ME YELLIN', SCREAMIN' LOUD
YOU BETTER WATCHOUT THE LION'S OUT
