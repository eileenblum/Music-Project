Stepped into the endless fire
Acquired the demon of desire
The observer points his hand on you
Projects your fate through

Perdition
Perdition's in the air
You search for entrance to the fair
You have awakened it Beware

Walking restless though your life
Despair has been your loyal wife
The haunting's clearly up on you
Protects what s been abused

Perdition
Perdition's in the air
You search for entrance to the fair
You have awakened it Beware

Felt the thrill
Met conditions to reach to a deal
Sudden kill
Blind to see
Promises like a drop fell to sea
Let it be

Soundless voice
I feel the oncoming death, awful noise
Much rejoice
Set it free
Got to end that unbreakable spree
Search of me

Perdition
Perdition's in the air
You search for entrance to the fair
You have awakened it beware
