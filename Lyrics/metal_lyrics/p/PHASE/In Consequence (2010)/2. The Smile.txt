There is a smile of love and there s a smile of deceit
There's a smile of all smiles and the smile where those (two smiles) meet

There is a cry of war and there's a cry of despair
There's a cry of all cries and a cry where you

Can meet me
You can
Meet me there

Under the face of god all actions can be foreseen
There's a peculiar smile crack when the desire is keen

There is a place of sin and there's a place of remorse
There is a place in god's grace and the place where you can

Can meet me
You can
Meet me there

There's that fire above
(That) drives this inspiring love
Then there s too much to touch
Watch one more lie unfold

[Inspired by the homonym poem by William Blake]
