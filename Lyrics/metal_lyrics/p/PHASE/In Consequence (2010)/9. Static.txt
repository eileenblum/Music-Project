It feels quite you
When you're drowned in darkness
Lust overwhelming you

I stand astounded
Feelings' slackness
Just scanning the next truth

You're craving for my sex
(In) your lost soul's inner depths
For you're in your first real false steps
You've never died before

Do what you do
Just 'cause they see it all wrong
Convinced once more it's you

Seeing when you wanna see
You need to belong
Right things on time for you

So tell me who you are
Before we get that far
Drop your disguise for my surprise
That s what I m longing for

Life on the edge for you
To see beyond the hedge
Please tell me who you are
Not any truth that bends

You always do what you do
Just 'cause they see it wrong
Please babe I'm not that strong
Drop your disguise for my surprise

No intention to hide
So twisted inside
Next strong wind to ride
