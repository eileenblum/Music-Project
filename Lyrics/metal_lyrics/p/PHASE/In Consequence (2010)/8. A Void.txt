Feeling weird, Acting strange
Out of human range
Great derange

Bare emotions you almost laugh
Affection always on behalf
And it seems so rough

Concentrate, masturbate
The "Big Li(f)e" served to you on a plate
Eliminate

Your life's snatch, quite a catch
Being replaced by the next batch
Your bottom touch

And I fall, fall from the edge
And I fold, masking strange
What I hold, plausibility lends
While I crave Independence?

Can't remember how I got in
I can't see doors in this departure lounge
Stuck in this limbo
Where's the road back home
I have to find the way back home
Can't remember how I got in
I have to find a way back home
