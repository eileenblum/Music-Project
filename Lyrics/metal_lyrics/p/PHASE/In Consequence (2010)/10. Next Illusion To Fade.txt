Run but from fate you can't hide
Done long before you decide

Feel, everything must be real
Kill, to defend one's idea(l)s

And I feel so alone
In this desert I roam
Empty words carved in stone
For no sin I atone

Dying everyday to believe
Burned in pursuing sweet relief

Chance, just for the sake of change
Own, not a thing worth exchange

And I am so alone
In this wasteland I roam
Empty words carved in stone
For no sin I atone
