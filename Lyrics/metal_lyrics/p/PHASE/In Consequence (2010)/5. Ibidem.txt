Stay, stay here and listen to the way,
The wind is blowing
Lay before the fire, then betray
Your secret passion play

You must remain all thoughts free
You won t believe your senses' spree

Pray, your tribute to the unknown god pay
He's grace retain
Day, by day we're killing us away
A slow decay

You're still the same, you've no gain
You need release for once again

Ask me
Ask me
Spectator of your uncolored vanity

Touch me
Feel me
Am I real? (Or) Was I born from your insanity?
