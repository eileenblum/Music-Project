Touching ground
Held by an unseen bound
For western star
Drags me way too far
To find you my love
To build that connection above
Feels so strong, can't be wrong

Can't be wrong, it's no wrong

Love and hate
So easy to overrate
Fearful bait
Lover designate
It runs through the vein
Raising hate in vain
Presumed Gain, breathes again

Blows again

Hypnotic state
Closer to Relate
Drug we take
There s no chance to fake
Love to hate
Greatest Love to date
Feels so strong, (but) for how long

For how long, for how long, for how long
