Dying inside your dream
You hear that voiceless scream
You re trying to get along
With your self again

Live inside a lie
Suppress the truth, deny
You always seem to be
Yourself when you're pretending

You mustn't feel
You must steal
You must conceal the truth
You haven't felt
You have heard
And you keep on pretending

Just defending

Run but you can't hide
You never can really decide
When you think it's up to you, you'd better think twice

Put that fire out
You're speechless again though you shout
You die to understand, but you won't get it

I want it so much
I want it so much
It slips away
But I want it so much

You mustn't feel
You must steal
You must conceal the truth
You haven't felt
You have heard
And you keep on pretending

Still descending

I can't breathe
