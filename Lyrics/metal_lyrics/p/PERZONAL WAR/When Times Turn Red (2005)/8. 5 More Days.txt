[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter]

Going deeper getting under
the surface that I never dared to touch all times before
Where go to? Where we have come from?
and what is the reason for acceptance that we are struggling for?

[Pre-chorus):]
(All of us) Long for a ticket
(All of us) Pay for a seat
(All of us) Take time and kick it
(All of us) Until we bleed

Am I really waiting for a sign
or lays the answer to mu question in me for a whole time?
Where I come from? And where I go?
letting loose my mind to see my vision grow

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
On day one I was going under
On day two I begin to wonder
Is it worth the time I walk this twisting line?
On day three I thought of my ways
On the fourth day looked my face
To get back myself I needed five more days

Why am I hanging in a balance?
not able to decide not make a step and take my last chance
The stones in my way have to be moved
The real sense of inner strength has to be proved

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
