[Fills solo]

Generation unface
Ringtone terror all days
I am switching through the programs
What can be just sucks

Changing styles in all ways
pretenders of the new faith
the guardians of the new age
better open not their mouths

(make-up wake up)

Sitting on a fat ass
A consuming faceless mass
the imitation of life
We are killing our own style

The lowest level is not reached
The colors of time have bleached
hidden under make-up
we keep ourselves in shape

(wake up dead with a burning head)

Inferno, Inferno, Inferno
The so called trend is dead
Inferno, Inferno, Inferno
and all I see is red

Inferno, Inferno, Inferno
The so called trend is dead
Inferno, Inferno, Inferno
and all I see is red

Inferno!
