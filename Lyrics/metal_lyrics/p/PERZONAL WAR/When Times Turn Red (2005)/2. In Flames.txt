[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter &amp; Matthias Zimmer]

Step by step we are getting higher
throwing coals to rake the fire
Unable now to stop our course

No compromise we will face the fact
keep crushing or go down
Our time has come regrets are gone

[Chorus:]
Hell be our future, heaven our past
Choose our side made a decision at last
Grinding togheter one stands for all
The unit is complete now togheter we will fall

Well prepared and fast as hell
you are now an easy prey
Now it is time to drop the ball

What has been is ending here
and now we take the chance
Standing togheter we can break a lance

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Step by step we are getting higher
throwing coals to rake the fire
Unable now to stop our course

No compromise we will face the fact
keep crushing or go down
Our time has come regrets are gone

[Chorus]

[Lead]
