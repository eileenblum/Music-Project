[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter &amp; Matthias Zimmer]

Fear is not what we call a friend
it is clear, things have to be defended
What is the price we are paying to afford
no more emotions maybe our last resort

From the underground voices call our names
Let us believe our own words

Hate is a feeling we supress
project on others to let ourselves be blessed

From the underground searching for our names
to find out where we are standing
From the underground into a time of change
the angels are singing for the last time

[Solo]

In hell they are waiting to release our hate
for all we have not forgiven
The demon seed is what we keep on feeding
we cut our own veins for an eternal bleeding

From the underground voices call our names
let us believe our own words
From the underground read the signs of red
the angels are singing for the last time
