[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter &amp; Matthias Zimmer]

Still I am searching for my way
Still I am waiting for the day
on which my memories are ending
(a never ending up and down)

Still I am drowning deep in time
try to find out what is mine
and figure out a compromise
find the thin line

[Chorus:]
Maybe I follow an illusion
sometimes reality means pain
A never ending search for reasons
The unbeliever is my mine

Maybe life turn black on me
lost the ability to see
Each medal can be viewed
from different sides

What is real and what is game?
Sometimes lost and sometimes gain
The devil in the detail
drives my mind insane

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
