[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter &amp; Matthias Zimmer]

Every step is so well planned forward
the next is in progress the last not yet done
Trend is acting first be in time
thinking later start the run

Running faster
In burning traces our disease
Turn on the master
Volume just to be increased

Even higher we cut off our wings
producing pushing just to throw away
but I still have my hope

Social competence is not needed
profit is what counts at last
Fit into a scheme right here and now
or be part of the past

Even deeper we cut off our own roots
Renewing reforms kicking them away
but I still have my hope

[Chorus:]
My hope...
sometimes it is painted red
My hope...
the color of the dead

Many steps so well planned backwards
The progress cannot be undone
Trend was acting first no more time
for a new start we are done!

Burning faster in fires on our own
The is no turning back
we are standing here alone

Even higher we cut off our wings
producing pushing just to throw away
but I still have my hope

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Even deeper we cut off our own roots
Renewing reforms kicking them away
but I still have my hope

[Chorus]
