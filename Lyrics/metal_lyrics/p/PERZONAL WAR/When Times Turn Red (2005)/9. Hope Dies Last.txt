[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter &amp; Matthias Zimmer]

Try to understand what is around
From the first day that we are born
until the day we hit the ground

Through the highs and lows we have to go
Development that goies in rapid speed
is what we call a steady growth

[Chorus:]
Hope dies last
Light the torch and see the light
Hope dies last
Keep it burning from inside

Measured not by status more by deeds
Evolution made its own way
Spit out unexpected breeds

Is it life to walk with hate accept pain is a common fellow
Still closed eyes pretend to see
we have found but lost the key

[Chorus]

What is our sidewalk the thin line of black and white
Rising the tide and deny all the grey

Hope dies last...

[Fills lead]

Try to understand what is around
From the first day that we are born
until the day we hit the ground

Through the highs and lows we have to go
Development that goies in rapid speed
is what we call a steady growth

[Chorus]

Hope dies last...
