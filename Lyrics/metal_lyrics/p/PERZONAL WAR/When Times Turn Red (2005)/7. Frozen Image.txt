[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter &amp; Matthias Zimmer]

What has reached me is so hard
to understand it seems to be unreal?
An ice cold situation and I don't know how to feel

Frozen images come back to life and get up in motion
Memories hidden in my mind wake up my emotions

[Chorus:]
Come with me...
to the edge of desperation
Come with me...
see the signs that give us shelter on our way

When we have a way in mind
and follow a direction
Single drops from to a lake
and become cause for action

On the las break it is important
to lay down your creed
When we close our eyes forever
sink into the final sleep

[Chorus]

(die, why) is it worth to get free again?
(I try) to fin sense in those days...

[Solo]

[Chorus]
