[Lyrics: Matthias Zimmer]
[Music: Martin Buchwalter &amp; Matthias Zimmer]

Following my conspiracy
Faking my own philosophy
The inside out turns black on me
becomes my second face

This is what I am
pour the black soil out of skin
Squeeze the poison out
renew my mind eliminate all doubts

Never fail in my decisions
My ideals and my own vision
Unspoken words left dead and unsaid
What made me put on my own crown of thorns

Is this what I am
kick the dark dreams out of my sleep
Drown deep inside my mind
open my seeing eye - rip off the blind

From the first day I knew all my fears are gone
I am my own saviour
On the last day I knew things went wrong because
I was my own saviour

Following my jealousy
Pushed myself to ecstasy
The inside out turned black on me
and let me lose my face

Is this what I am
kick the dark dreams out of my sleep
Drown deep inside my mind
open my seeing eye - rip off the blind

[Chorus:]
From the first day I knew all my fears are gone
I am my own saviour
On the last day I knew things went wrong because
I was my own saviour
Could not accept my inner voices
let them talk to deafened ears
I did so wrong in many choices
and found myself controlled by fears

[Solo]

[Chorus]
