Deep in your sleep I reach your head whisper
words into your mind from unknown spaces unknown times
whisper words into your mind
My stories tell 'bout love and hate my stories tell 'bout desperation
My stories tell 'bout ecstasy the highlights and the depths of life
I am the one you call insane and I 'm the one who swore
He'd never feel the tension imaginative I became
The only one you trust now kick me and you're blamed
Sorry here I am again screaming word into your mind
From hidden feelings please don't cry telling stories of yourself I
Once upon a time you called my name and surely without doubt I came
Crawling in chaos of your empty words
Growing stronger by your lies I'm the master of demise
Crawling in chaos of your empty words
I betrayed you spread my wings inside your heart
More, I raped you got a so important part
I betrayed you please don't cry call my name and I will fly
