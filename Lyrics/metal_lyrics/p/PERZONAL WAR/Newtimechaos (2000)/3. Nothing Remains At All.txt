Oh my friend I'll tell you what I'm feeling now, my deepest secrets
Come into my world and you'll be part of myself
Can you feel the confusion that leads me where it wants
Oh I'm just a puppet on a string but I enjoy
A new day awakes but I don't know which path it takes to leave its mark on me
Fate has grabbed the strings tight in its hands so find the strength to change it
I know time is an immemorial state and I will never compromise
Although I'm weak I still stand by me and I will never compromise
And still all these moments last for years but I will try to hold back my tears
I won't deny myself otherwise my deepest sense would drown in lies
