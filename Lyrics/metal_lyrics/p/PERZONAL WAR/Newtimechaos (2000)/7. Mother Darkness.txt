Senses sharp as ice darkness my paradise what does it matter it is all the same to me
Too fast for human eyes my presence paralyzes a silhouette that is one with time and space
Born between life and death a hybrid more or less but I don't care I'm the walker on two sides
The daylight bears an offer but I'm condemned to suffer until the day when my misssion is
fulfilled
My shadow you can feel your life is all I steel your end will be my kiss ...ius sanguinis
