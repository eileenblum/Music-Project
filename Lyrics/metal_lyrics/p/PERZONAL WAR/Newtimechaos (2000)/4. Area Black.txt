When the moment is mine I turn back in time
The secrets I keep lay deep, come and seek
Where eyes look through you showing they can't see
An empty gaze staring into vacancy
With nothing inside hiding from your view
Always distant to the unknown new
When sense without a meaning is put into words
A strange coincidence dicovers little hurts
Like needles pinning inside of your heart
The scepticism's tearing you apart
Took for dead but still alive
Sometimes it's coming up and lets you see
Took for dead but still alive
Releases your instinct gives new identity
An evil seed is growing from the deep
Lays shadows over parts that seem asleep
Its weakening abilities to feel
Intensity of soul to become real
