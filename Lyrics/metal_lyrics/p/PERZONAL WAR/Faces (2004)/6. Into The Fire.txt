Steady we are heading for an end, a growing anger
The core of what we call our mother earth is spitting flames
Laughter about us all what we built and created
The one that we call god takes back now what belongs to him

No one knows when it will end...
But we can be sure our last time is certain

Avarice in mind, the opposite to waste of gods
We are raping what we need to live and view through childrenâs eyes
Deafening the silence will be that which stays at last
Through floods and fires we will all be witnesses to our own fall

I closed my eyes but didnât see
Knew it for long inside of me
Itâs our last time swallowing up in flames
Itâs our last time, no one will remember our names
Itâs our last time going down in flames
And that is the way that we chose

Cowardice, swimming against the stream is ending on one day
The character of man is broken, just wait a bit more time
Deafening the silence will be that which stays at last
We didnât keep in mind that we did laid in our hands

Sleeping, dreaming
Leave this world
Escape the truth
Awaking, fleeing
To a peaceful place in youth
