Whatâs the meaning of love? Whatâs the meaning of pain?
Is honesty just a phrase? A lost ideal? Just a name?
Is it characterâs weakness? Is it characterâs strength?
Living up to your principles, donât abuse any chance

Ask me what has to be
Ask me why I should see
I want to know that is all
When you ask me this question
My answer is âmeâ!

This is our fate so full of love
Hate and moments of tragic
Every moment means life
Breathe every breath
And inhale it as deep as you can

What is my role in time? Whatâs the way I should live?
Steady presence in my mind, what I can I should give
Donât push aside the fact that one day it will end
We will turn back to earth, then the circle closes again

This is our fate so full of love
Ecstasy and moments of glory
Every moment means death
Breathe every breath
And inhale it as deep as you can

Whatâs the meaning of love? Whatâs the meaning of pain?
Is stability a phrase? A lost virtue? Just a name?
Fascinating and strange what a heart takes inside
Love and hate sometimes so near
To each other so equal, so tight
