This is written in my blood
All I gave is all I could
I will warn you, you ainât gonna take it
Take it not the easy way
Take it precisely as I say
For you know this is my own creation

I worked so hard on my own
And after all I have grown
To the individual that you might fear
Hiding not behind my face
Iâm so sure I found my place
From there confrontation feels so easy

Why is it so hard to kick a thought out of your mind
And keep it at the same time?

Come see my eyes, what do you see?
Tell me what you expect of me
This is all I gave
I killed myself
My heart and my soul they will slowly die
...come back alive!

This is built up with my sweat
I was the one who curled in dread
Maybe I just pulled it much too hard then
I walked my way with consequence
And ever searched for evidence
But there are some things
You will never find it
