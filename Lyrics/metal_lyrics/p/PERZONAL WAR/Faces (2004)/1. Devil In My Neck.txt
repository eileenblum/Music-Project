Back on track some devil in my neck
Maybe heâs the one who guides me
On the road that will end somewhere I donât know
Pushing me somehow in a fatal bow, the direct way
For me itâs still locked
Because the key is falling to unlock what I need

Iâm diving
Into water crystal clear, deep inside me
Into the flames that burn my heart
Into the storm that takes me back to my inside
Into the light that shines so dark

To reach my goal godâs still in my soul
Maybe heâs the one who guides me
On the path that leads me to the lost and gone
Looking back on the still worn track
The view to kick some asses, start with me!

All these days
All these years
Things are over
They are past

All my joys
All my fears
Are they gone or still there?
Will they stay forever?

Who can give me some hint
To a question â unclear â to a dead heartâs feeling
Whoâs the one that will wake me?
Who will kiss me alive when I am still dead inside
Slowly die?
