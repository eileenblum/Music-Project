All I have to tell you now, my friend
Iâll lead you to the certain and nothing said
But you know what I mean to you
Silent instead and still you know my words are true
You know my words are true
Keep in mind what I mean to you

I am the part youâd better like to hide
Half of your soul and your inside
A piece of your mind and your inside
A little more than you allow
Iâm like your second face somehow

All I wanna tell you now my friend
Youâd better tale me by my hand
Perhaps it burns you or it feels cold
Come feel the opponent on your own

Faces
Faces
Faces
Faces...

I know you try to hide your second face
The harder you try the more you fall from grace
