I know it well, in fact, I donât know anything
My so clear answer is just a silent speech
I see through you although my eyes are closed
My bleeding heart is to you exposed

My safe appearance threatens to collapse
What interference sucks off my sap?

While I listen close to you
My mind is somewhere else
Your words: for me an empty phrase
(With so much evidence)
Of course I know, but please, repeat your words
My soul is on fire and this feeling hurts

My safe appearance threatens to collapse
What interference sucks off my sap?

By all this pain inside, this pain inside
I call back those feeling to my mind
By all this pain inside, this pain inside
I call back the demons of my mind

I lie in your face
In fact I speak the truth
You wonât believe me
Thatâs for sure
(But I donât care)

The pain inside, it gives me strength to live
Some kind of love inside of my deepest core

What is it I see?
What is it I feel?
