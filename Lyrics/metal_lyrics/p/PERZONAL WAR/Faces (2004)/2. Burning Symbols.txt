The futureâs clouded, face it winks now
But we donât look back again
The signs of what will come appear now
And we go further again
The living colors turn to grey
But the warning seems to be not heard
The edge gets nearer step by step
The natural balance is disturbed

Too many ways we tried to walk
And consequences â talked about â
But no one is changing what destroys
The simple things we need for life

The chaos starts with raging storms
Goes further now with burning symbols
That we built and what we stand for...
Our sky turns red like a warning light

We will never be going down
We are so sure we are in right but no!
We will never be going down
We never doubted that we could be wrong
