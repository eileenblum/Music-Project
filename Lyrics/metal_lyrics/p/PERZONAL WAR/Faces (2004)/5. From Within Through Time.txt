A view so deep inside your eyes and I realize who you are
It opens me the way to mind and heart
And it says more than a hundred letters
And much more than a thousand words
Yes, I feel there is more within than you allow

There are so many impressions
I learned to explain in time
I focused more on your life
And pushed aside what was mine

Do you know me?
Should I show you who I really am?
Do you think of me?
Should I show you what I really am?

Your inner self side is set free and you turn your eyes from me
Too hard to bear the truth and what may be behind
And I raised my head again and the plate-glass shows my face
Like countless times, like countless times before

There are so many impressions
I learned to explain in time
I focused more on your life
And pushed aside what was mine

Do you know me?
Should I show you who I really am?
Do you think of me?
Should I show you what I really am?

There are so many impressions
I learned to explain in time
Perhaps it still was my life
I didnât see it was mine
