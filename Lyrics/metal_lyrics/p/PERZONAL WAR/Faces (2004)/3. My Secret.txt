Do you know the feeling when you try it day by day?
Leave those days behind to walk a new different way

Again those feelings
Again the pain

Ask yourself the question
Are you willing to forget?

Have you really closed the door inside?
And wonât look back

Again the darkness
Again the pain

Theirs is so much that we canât see
Hidden in our deepest memories
What has been what is what will be
This is my secret

Again remembrance
Again the pain

This is my secret
Again the pain...
