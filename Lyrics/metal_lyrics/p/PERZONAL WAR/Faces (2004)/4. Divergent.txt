A so long time now itâs unclear
A thin line between hope and fear
Too many steps go back and stand still far beyond the dawn
I walk my way â still wait for you to come
This feelingâs new but quite as gone
I am eager for the time that will come again or not

I donât know what to do now
Am I right or just too proud of what I think that makes me alive?
Keeps me alive, just gives me life
That makes me live, that makes me give but never forgive
Never shows what really is

Wonât you go and keep your decision
Who may know about this divergent daydream in me?
Let me know and make your decision
You canât know about this divergent daydream in me
About the daydream inside my head
About the daydream inside of me

The more I get, the less I know
Progress is marching on too slow
I have to admit itâs in a way
Exciting if we walk the same course or not
Come, suck me off and let me in
But beware what may lay within
Never forget that faster than you think
I could turn the tables
