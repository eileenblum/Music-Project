The dawn of all is the birth of our lives
We struggle to fill our lungs with air that we are breathing
Searching for ways, time goes by and our quest begins
Still donât know who we are...after all

Calling to mind all the years that passed by
All of our kind have to tell their own story
Hiding behind what we want to be â still believe
In what we want to be â ourselves â see ourselves

In a run steady stressed for the top so we can be blessed
Trying to reach the stars that seem to be fading
The nearer we get the more the distance is growing
And from my core deep in some painful anger is roaring

Hold back my tears, may be the wrong way I know
Why should I keep them back
Isnât weakness a strong part of me
Let out my tears to give that world what I need to live
What I need to live...to cry out what I really am

Physical age means not growing in mind
The marks and scars on my skin, they will guide me
But what lays in me?
Maybe I donât know it myself
Unspoken and not solved
Experienced but not involved
