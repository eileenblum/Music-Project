The speed of time [3x]

My scars get more
Life leaves traces on your face
Future gets less
And your pastâit grows

You find yourself in a steady struggle
When or where it endsânobody knows

This is the speed of time
And we stand all in line
Until we leave the game
And what's left is just a name

My expectations getting low
While sand is falling on my face
And when the hourglass is bursting
I have to count my days

The speed of time [3x]

The days get less
Leaving room for my doubts
Did you walk the path you wanted to go
Why seems life like a constant speeding
Is there no way to keep it slow?

This is the speed of time
And we stand all in line
Until we leave the game
And what's left is just a name

[4x]
My expectations getting low
While sand is falling on my face
And when the hourglass is bursting
I have to count my days

The speed of time [3x]
