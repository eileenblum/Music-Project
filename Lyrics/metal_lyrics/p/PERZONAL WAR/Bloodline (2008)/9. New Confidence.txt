I throw myself into fire
While I am bending I am feeding the flames
With my thoughts with my needs
With my secrets my deeds
This desire that I've tried to push aside

I won't be the same after all

Love once so near now a hole gaping here
In my heart where instead should grow unity

This is the first day of my new life
And I know that it won't be the last
Do I feel new confidence or maybe I'm lying to myself who knows
Only time will heal those wounds only time will hear my words

Slowly I realise what I've done
But in fact there is no chance for return
Went too far lied too long fate proofed that I did wrong
End it here end it now and forever

I've made myself to a poet of

Doubts â this is clear will be my guidance here
In this story that I've changed by my own

Fragments of life, broken dreams made by lies
And the mud is still falling from my hands
