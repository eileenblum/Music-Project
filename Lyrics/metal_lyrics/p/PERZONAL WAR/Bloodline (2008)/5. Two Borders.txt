This war is raging on for years
Nobody knows anymore who is friend and who is enemy
So called soldies lie on a wide road ... and no onw knows what they are
Fighting for [crossed out] fighting for, over themselves

Thousands of people had to see... purpose between two borders
Their only choice to die or run somewhere they don't know
Everything they had is lost... only memory remains

[illegible] under a dead tree that has any branch and leaf
Anyone has nothing but strong is their belief
In peace that may come a new home or just a single drop of rain
"Hope dies last" are empty words when you have lived your life in vain

The waiting for nothing gives no answers to your needs
No fear inside â a vision I called my life

Dying every new day for ideals that fill the pockets of the wrong
The make the masses weak â minorities strong
The borders unclear â there are no orders left
And [illegible] this war will end how many innocent
have been bereft?
