My senses remain
This cut it comes for real
No thought of any cost â I know I will accept the deal
Of pain of fires freezing
See a newborn son increasing

Of love of distance turned to fear
For you know â the time is here

You know these times have gone by
This evolution keeps just the strongest alive
Say goodbye

A needful final change
And the ship could wave
But it won't sink
Remember we're with one foot already in the grave

This pain let's fires freezing
And a newborn son increasing
This love this hate that turned to fear
Close the chapter end it here
