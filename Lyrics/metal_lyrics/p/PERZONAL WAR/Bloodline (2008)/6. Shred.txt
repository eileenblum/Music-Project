No more subordination to laws concerning aus
No more justification just liberation to what has balls
No more war inside a scene that needs impulses to survive
The test of time we've to break some rules to pursue our line

Shred lay to ashes â this is our intention inhale our words

No more time for excuses concerning style and way
No more words for things already said and finished
