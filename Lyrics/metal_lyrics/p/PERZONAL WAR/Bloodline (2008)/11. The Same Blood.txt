Maybe a dream of everyone
To live on in others' deeds
Breathe on in others' needs

There runs the same blood through our veins
This feeling knows any words
So intense it almost hurts

And every breath could be the last
It's running out of time
A new life's born...
Another ending just in time

Give what I can to see it grow
There's life streaming through my hands
Protection until the end

This is my own flesh and blood
And I will be the one who cares
No matter what's the price
I will be there
I will be there

The tears that have been falling
Gave life to a new seed
Nothing has been in vain
An ocean filled with time
