This pressure a selfmade hell where I find myself
Imperfection and fear
What is driving me to decisions that should not be made
What is forcing me further to the edge

I feel no more I see no more
What surrounds me is losing its meaning
Insecurity is frightening me and I wish I would be dreaming

Honesty â a thin line between lies and well chosen words
A typical habit â no more
What lets me believe that I could cut myself into pieces
To fit in again

I feel no more I see no more
What surrounds me is losing its meaning
Insecurity is frightening me and I wish I would be dreaming

This life that I chose
Sometimes it feels like an overdose
A stumbling way on a thin line
And the loss could be mine

The fall could be painful
Innocence has been taken from me
On the first day that I've spread my wings
The first moment I've lived for my own
Burns in my heart as cold as a stone
