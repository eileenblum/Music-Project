The truth could be a kind too violent
That is the reason why we should stay deaf
The ones who know better stay silent
It's a habit we won't change it so forget it

A global process for a b-human much too high
Keep your mouth shut and close your eyes

Not more than a day
It needs to change a run forever
More than a day
Maybe a lifetime or a whole age
Wounds are damned to stay

This disappointment do you know what I mean?
Maybe a virus without name
Respect a foreign word the same as tolerance 
A killing process â not a game

A global process for a b-human much too high
Keep your mouth shut and close your eyes

Not more than a day
It needs to change a run forever
More than a day
Maybe a lifetime or a whole age
Wounds are damned to stay

Fake needs protection â right is the way the masses cheat
Hate is the reaction â to the questions of the weak
