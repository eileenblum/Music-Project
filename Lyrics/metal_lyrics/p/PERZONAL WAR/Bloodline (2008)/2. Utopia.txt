I am dreaming in silence
My visions â not fiction â they're real
And I know there's another world
I'm sure there is something I feel

I am crossing the border
A secret throws shadows on me
And ahead lies my answer
Just one step away
But still too far to see

Irrational hate leads me straight into this cavity
The kingdom of the worm is waiting for me

Utopia I'm sure the missing link is me
If you could see through my eyes
Utopia just one step forward sets me free
And what I tried to keep slowly dies

My safe hoard is gone
Taken from me now I'm not more than one
And this new breed of life
For me just means that another one dies

It was my safe home but they have changed it all
They have brought hell into my sleep
Another memory is vanishing drifting (crossed out) fading away
I cannot keep
