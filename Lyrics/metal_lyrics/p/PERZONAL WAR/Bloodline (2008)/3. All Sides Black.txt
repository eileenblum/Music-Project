This is another story
Of honour pain and greed
Believe in right and glory
One is winning others lose (crossed out) bleed

There's always two sides
But solution means when no one wins
Forgetting for one day under which banner you walk
Peace â just can't be found in understanding
A different way, an unknown way to be

There's no solution when there's no tolerance at all
A revolution begins in mind may stop our fall

Turn on the news again
A loose tongue speaks of death
One more assassin's work
Some children breathe their last

There's always two sides
But solution means when no one wins
Forgetting for a while what flag your are holding high
Peace â just can't be found in understanding
A different way, an unknown way to be

There's no solution when there's no tolerance at all
A revolution begins in mind may stop our fall

Swallow the daily hate
We are already late
Wait for another call
One step to change it all
