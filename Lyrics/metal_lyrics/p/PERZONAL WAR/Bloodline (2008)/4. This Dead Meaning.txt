I'm following your words
I'm following your ways
I'm following your [crossed out] to every word you say

I'm following your eyes
I'm following your view
I'm following your to everything you do

There is so much left I know it better
But I'm paralyzed â too weak to change myself
Much too many words with any meaning
Too much wasted time floating away

I'm standing where I am
There is no more shelter
And now I see what's left for me
My dream is ending here

This dead meaning
This dead meaning

I'm following your mouth
I'm following your deeds ["a" amended to "e"]
And your unspoken words have turned to my own needs
I'm following your steps and I'm following your meaning
I'm present even when you're dreaming
