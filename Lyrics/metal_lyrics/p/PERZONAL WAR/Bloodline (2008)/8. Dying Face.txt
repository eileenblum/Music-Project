Speak out words let's break the silence
But there is no one to listen
Seconds turn to minutes, hours to days
But still a single word is missing

Is it me who looks into his own face
And calls himself a liar?
Is it me who is blaming all around
And will I life the torch to my own pyre?

Dream on â neverending
Feel your eyes get filled with sand
Dream on â neverending
Broken dreams â your only friend

Is it me who looks into his own face
And calls himself a liar?
Is it me who is blaming all around
And will I life the torch to my own pyre?

Buried deep in your emotions
Locked out is the truth
Hidden in a selfmade blank â a desert cold â
You are losing youth

Just a single word would change the situation
But there is still ignorance and pride ...
Feeding your resignation
