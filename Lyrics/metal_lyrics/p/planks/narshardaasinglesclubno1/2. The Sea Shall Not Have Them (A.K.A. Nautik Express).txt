Structures and fractures
Carves in bodies of sovereignty
Essential to the ones lost,
a body of doctrine to delegate and suffocate
Floating down streams,
in opposition to this wake.
To make this count,
to make it worthwhile,
to call it life.
In retrospect it could have been so easy
to reclaim this difference in you.
But this is a willing crave to descent into the Maelstrom
