[performed by Planks]Colossal as it was
Colossal as we were
Iâve lost this city
Iâve lost its soul
I was fond of you,
but lack the memories
The undisputed truth,
a victim of this process
Iâm aware of the symptoms
but lack the cure
Bright, bright as the sun
Once used to be
A moment collapsed
Mental remains
