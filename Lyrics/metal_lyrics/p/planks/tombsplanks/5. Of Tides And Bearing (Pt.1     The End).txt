[performed by Planks]The silence is instrumentalized
In shades and pieces of what
Life could have been
Yes, I do remember the times
I had the chance to alienate
From the walking dead
Step out of the narcotic state
The profound grip loses touch after all
How could you turn away my body from my soul?
