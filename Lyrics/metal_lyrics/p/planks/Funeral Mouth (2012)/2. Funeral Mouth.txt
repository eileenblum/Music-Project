Night has fallen cold and hard,
Left to ruins as suns deteriorate.
With hands on shoulders and perverted necks
The sons of the sun are left to ruins abide by morrow.
A pact is broken as trust is lost
Blood draws blank, to live in hell
These stones are covered with the keepsakes of the lost and sallow
Where mothers sob and fathers famish
Go on and look for the marrow in this paragon
Just to find answers carved in flesh.
