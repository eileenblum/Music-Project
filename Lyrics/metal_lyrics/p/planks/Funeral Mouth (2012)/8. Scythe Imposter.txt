Where worlds collide, at the end of days
and love resides and never fades.
Where truths are torn, from dreams derive,
a shattered core to long lived smiles.
In silhouettes it spoke to me,
spoke of the times that never be.
To destinies as closures king
I just observe, can't change a thing.
This is where it stands - will never bow.
God-like tall and wisdom how.
Where ends seem odd-shaped and self made it waited for decades.
As an acolyte from nowhere I always felt it to be there.
Liberty and forced ends, sat down to hold hands.
Old shadows and deliverance, verify repentance.
