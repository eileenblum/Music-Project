A living reproach no one dares to approach
â you made me.
Everyone I ever loved, I failed and it never left my head
â you made me.
All the strangers know my name, all the ones I turned away.
Make this silence as cold as possible so I can value this closure.
All the strangers know my name, all the ones I turned away
