(Words about other worlds 
Bigger, better. All theirs, not yours. 
Where skin is a map to all your worries, 
you still are the most beautiful of them all.)
In movement away lies passage and pattern, 
it abandons all your courage. 
You're so strong, you just don't see it. 
Raised like a wolf in the belly of the worst memories, 
you dug a hole so deep you can't find the way out. 
Eyes closed, buried in my arms - is this home? 
Distant but so close, please take me with you. 
I chose to throw my heart into this hole, 
because this 'we' is so beautiful. 
No matter how often, how long - 
I hate the sadness when you leave.
