Six wall made coffin. Asphyxiating. 
Embodyment and legacy to wars neither won nor lost. 
As a prisoner to routine doors are opened where one constantly struggles to keep them locked. 
To feel relief on the outside, 
to live regret on the inside. 
Dead vows of folsom obligation keep this cell illuminated. 
Dearest heart travels lightyears in the open 
to no greater goal but to be at peace, finally. 
This room is not empty without you but you are empty inside these walls.
