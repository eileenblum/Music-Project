No light â No more, ever since your fall. 
Rain, two years straight - so absolute and obsolete. 
The ways I made you feel when I stepped away 
and turned to dust. 
Regret will not take out the fact: 
out of boredom I skipped the easy way out. 
This love is like a wound that won't heal 
How do you live with yourself now? 
I took you down â I killed the sun. 
To the death of all resemblance we must go. 
Spear me your dark words, as I have plenty of my own. 
I feel sorry still, as it was my sun I tried to kill.
