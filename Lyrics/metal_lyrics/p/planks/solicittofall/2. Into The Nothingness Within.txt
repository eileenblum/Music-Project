The fluid of life - 
Poison blending in. 
Low â up to the highest degree. 
The stasis on my way, 
dead, becalmed and drifting. 
Live in sin - 
Into the nothingness within. 
Abstract in words of 
guilt and amelioration. 
Never to resurface again. 
Floating, static, sinking. 
Into the nothingness within.
