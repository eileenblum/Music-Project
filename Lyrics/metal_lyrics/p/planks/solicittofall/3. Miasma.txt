Outrun Seasons, 
Outrun Years, 
All is black, 
No one cares. 
Solicit to fall - 
This fate in us all 
Like hell we are, 
Forever true. 
Blinded by time, 
Forever Alone 
It seems rather merciful 
that we do not remember 
the blood on our hands. 
Give in and die (because) 
in fact, you'll never be saved. 
The moments we stole, 
Solicit to fall. 
We act as expected to. 
It is the fate in us all. 
Failure is the only movement we know.
