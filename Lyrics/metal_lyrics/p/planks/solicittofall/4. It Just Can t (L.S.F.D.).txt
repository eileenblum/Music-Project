It doesn't matter if you forget me 
as I won't forget you. 
My regrets, I carry to tomorrow 
and my heart is not at peace. 

This place you leave in my head - 
I hold on to something and let it go. 

Speak to me, show me shapes of repute. 
For you I'd put the whole damn world down. 
Here I am, just in time to fall apart 
and it doesn't even bother me the way it should. 

Breaking up is easy, breaking down is too. 
I was falling for you while you were falling apart. 
But everything I would like to say to you, 
someone else said before me with better words. 

Without you it is a pathetic world with no ends.
