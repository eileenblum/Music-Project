The day I gave up on them
Was the day I realized
They gave up on me, so long ago

Burning houses to the ground
Leaves no need to open up the doors

To admit equals looking the storm
Right in the eye

Rather finite than confess - 
Rather tear dams
Than leaving reluctant

Whatever happens, whatever is,
I will die with my secrets
And rivers will follow
