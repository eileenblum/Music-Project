(I stole from the tombs your last drips of breath
Walking blinded, trying to compensate for this loss
Help me find the way aboard this ship)
Carry me away,
Right into the eye of the storm,
For this is where we cross
I stole from the tombs your last shining tears
I see they are beautiful
But only lies can make it to heaven
We are both on a way, walking without sight
We became the blinded because we denied to see
