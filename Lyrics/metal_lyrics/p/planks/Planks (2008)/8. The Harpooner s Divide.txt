You adhered to the harpoon we almost ran in
If this is how it has to be, fine.
Still we will not abandon this vessel.
You want us to perish
We just said: âNo, we are aliveâ
The sons and the daughters of life we are,
The sons and the daughters of hungry gods we will be.
There is a time 
To make pastâs wrong decisions decline
And head for the oceans
It is us, it is here and it is right â right now.
Heave down what is transfixed and consoled with resentment
