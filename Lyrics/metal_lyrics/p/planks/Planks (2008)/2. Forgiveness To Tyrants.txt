Always and always forever
Invoke the collapse
For yours are truly these ruins
Revelation: To flay skin from your neck,
Tender and lurid as a kiss

Covert prestige forever faceless
Hide behind tranquil eyes
Statues of stone
Losing everything in the end

You brought this on yourself
