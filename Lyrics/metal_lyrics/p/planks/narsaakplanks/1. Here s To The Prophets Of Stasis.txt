[performed by Planks]Hereâs to the prophets of stasis
Iconic mirrors reveal illuminated senses
Buried alive
Dull and cataleptic soul
Where are you?
Vitality sunken deep
to rise up anew
kissed and corrupted
wake up inverted
half the life it used to be
alive in their eyes
you are there â you are theirs

Frank â Bass
Benny â Drums
Ralph â Guitars, Vocals
