Places, dark and distant,
Prodigious in depth.
Like an abyss penetrating the globe,
This is where you live, my long lost friend.

Persistent in my dreams,
Crawl up 
To lurk and to lure.

I can't bury you nor can I heal,
In my veins, in my soul.

A despicable wall between us and sanity.
Rest for good now, my old friend.
For you will rise again...
To plunge me into the abyss
