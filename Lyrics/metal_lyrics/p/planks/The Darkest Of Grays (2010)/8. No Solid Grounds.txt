Sleep taken, can't control it walk and reach back Never conquered anything.

Tried this path so many times,
Crossed this bridge and millions of miles,
Never said goodbye this many times before.

And still there is no one to sacrifice for 
Out of control, out of touch.
The faces remain the same.

This kingdom is ruled by others,
And no, I don't worry.
You're doing fine
