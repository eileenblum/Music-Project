Conformity and consensus invigorated conformity to fake allies, plea for them to pull the strings
In vow â in ache, fed by the wolves.
In grief and concern Lapse into silence

This glorious will for power, feel it breaking, feel it leave.
You turned into everyone else. From remission to transgression Individual resignation and the choice of patient isolation.
In vow â in ache, fed to the wolves.
Just grief and concern, that's what you'll reap.
Like tentacles to guide you,
Like tentacles to lift you.

From where you stand the horizon's covered with words;
Lies and rules of all the others.
Freedom for you is to run the gauntlet,
Turn your back on them, because solitude prevails.
