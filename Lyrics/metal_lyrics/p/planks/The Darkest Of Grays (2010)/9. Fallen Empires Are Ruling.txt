It seems endless,
It feels eternal,
Vast and cold,
Standing alone.

Now that white is black,
And days are gray,
The daylight hours, they pass,
Like the people I have lost

Leave it be
When there is nowhere left to go,
There is nothing left to be done.
Now that I've lost everything,
Fear is the only enemy that I still know.
The fear of fear itself,
Harvesting the seeds I've sown
