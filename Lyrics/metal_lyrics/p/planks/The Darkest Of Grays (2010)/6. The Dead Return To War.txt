Fierce they stood in the brink of extinction,
Deviously watching towards absolution.
The walls could wait it out, but we couldn't.

Years felt as transient surcease when absolute chaos broke lose.

And there we stood, obtaining spellbound not afraid of the door but what lay behind it.
Constant revision made closure imminent,
Still we lost â Still we fell

We don't speak the name of the dead but faces, eyes and thoughts loomed large.

And no, we didn't forget a bit,
This familiar dominance,
Like a drug grants desperate moments of freedom.
They broke open the gates.
All caused by the love for decay.
