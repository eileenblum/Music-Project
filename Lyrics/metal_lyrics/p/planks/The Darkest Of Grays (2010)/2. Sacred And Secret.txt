Crooked halos, elapsing faith,
Manifestations of the earth as I see it 
Filled with life, worth the love of a whole heartbeat striking for the final time

Not in you, not in me

Striving to recover this faint idea You see it as given 
Devoid of feeling ghastly pale.
I believe in only this 

Not in you, not in me.

Depict order, 
There you will see I can only breathe in the stillness of this surface.
In fog entirely buried, 
Absent of light.

Not in you, not in me 
Not in you.

You reach out, I bow down to the one queen,
Filled with life, worth the love.
