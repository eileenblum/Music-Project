Now as the Age of Unholy Revelations is near
The rising Apocryphal Signs of blazing Hate
Raised in warfare, Baalberith's Black Spear
Carried by Beasts
Summoned from beyond the Gate

Towards the Bestial Armageddon

Bring forth the Horrors of Death
Satariel, Bletheal, Ia-Ee-Phlatul

The Apocryphal One's
Flaming gigantic Eye
Sigil of the rising storm
Of total darkness

Black assemblies,
Through the Storm the fly
By the rage of Abaddon
Kill those of holyness

Towards the Bestial Armageddon

Rise the Sign of the Horns
Belial, Bro-Kibalthus, Satan

Lords of Darkness, Those of the Night
You who have shown Me the true human face
