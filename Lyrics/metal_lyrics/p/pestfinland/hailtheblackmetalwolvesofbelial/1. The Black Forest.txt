Towards the Kingdom of Darkness Eternal
My Master is calling me
His blood in my veins summons me
Towards the Black Forest
The Earthly Throne of Satan
He is calling me...

There He stalks
The Black Goat of a Thousand Young
I know He is there
He is watching me

Like a part of Hell on Earth
The black lifeless trees
Rise from the soil
So natural it is
Yet not of this world
Pantheon
Of Satan's Endless might

There He stalks
The Black Goat of a Thousand Young
I know He is there
He is watching me forever

Possessed by Obsurity
Paralyzed by the Light of Satan's Eye
In the mist the Horns of the Goat are formed
Pair of eyes, red, blazing with fire

Our Master is watcing...
