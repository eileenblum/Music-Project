Maligant Winds carry out the wicked hymn
Song by a thousand tortured christians
Telling of the coming of the New Age of Satan
The New, Black Aeon
From beyond the stars carried by Black Wings
He arrives, to claim what is His to take
A horned shadow rises and shadows the sun
The Earth is blackened

In the dead of the Satanic Winter
Lord Sathanas returns
The sun is eclipsed
By the black leather wings

Without the light of the sun the ground turns cold
The bane of Life
The movement of the black wings rises the storm
That reaps those who stand beside their
Pathetic idols, which make weak the strong
Evil has laid its hand upon this World
By the black visions of Holocaust
Death turns a pleasure
Withing the cold black torment

In the dead of the Satanic Winter
Lord Sathanas returns
The sun is eclipsed
By the black leather wings

Satan, the True Lord of this World has revealed His hate
The storm of His hate leaves all life devastated
But still alive enough to serve for eternity

[Storming Diabolic Electrocution: Satanic Warmaster]

[Wielding of the Sword of Black Power: Iskariot]

In the dead of the Satanic Winter
Lord Sathanas returns
The sun is eclipsed
By the black leather wings
