The Eye of Satan has opened Hate
Mounted on Wolves of Steel, Purest of Hellspawn
Black Swords of Evil in hand
We storm onwards in a Storm of Fire
Hymnvocating the Angels of Left
With songs of desecration
Death and destruction

Riding Under the Sign of the Horns

Side by side with the Legions of Hell
Leaving behind only a Path of Flames
The Flame of Satan in our Black Hearts
The Black Blood of Satan in our veins
Forever for the Glory of Satan
Forever for the Might of Satan

Riding Under the Sign of the Horns

Under the Sigil of Satan we ride
Bringing forth chaos and death
Our Wolves of Stell spit devastation
On our Death-cursed paths
Towards the Triumph of Our Empire
Our scepters breathe Fire and Flame
A maligant fog of Death hovers before Us
And those who oppose shall perish
