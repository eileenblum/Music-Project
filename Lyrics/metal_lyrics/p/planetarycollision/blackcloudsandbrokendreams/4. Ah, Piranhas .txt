[Intro]
I won't let them

[Verse 1 -]
Eat my hopes and dreams alive,
I will make it out alright,
I've seen them die,
I've watched them die,
No hope inside,
As we wonder why,
Oh sweet revenge,
You pathetic bitch,
I watch your eyes,
Turn towards the light,
No hope inside,

You can run, but you can,
Never hide.

[Chorus]
I see them now,
In the depths of the sea,
Standing on the shore,
Just to watch them feed,

[Verse 2]
Every day, with you was just a fucking waste,
Feel their teeth, your blood is spilled for all to taste,
Today, your memory will fade away,
And no one will take your place,

[Verse 3]
I canât explain to you, what has happened to me,
Every time I look in the mirror, I hate what I see,
The memory of you is just another dead dream,
And with every passing second, my mind is ripping at the seams,
Watch as they tear you apart,
And these waters turn to red,
They've no mercy for this whore,
And I'll leave nothing left unsaid,

[Chorus]
I see them now,
In the depths of the sea,
Standing on the shore,
Just to watch them feed,
You scream in fear,
As they take you in,
Your worthless life,
Finally put to an end.
