[Intro ]
I swear on my soul,
He'll be the end of you.

[Verse]
Before they hear the lies,
That you have come to tell,
It's time they hear my story,
Four month's I've burned in Hell,
I watched the world I loved,
Pollute herself to death,
Don't speak another word,
Just save your fucking breath,

[Chorus]
I swore my life forever yours,
But you chose to turn the other way,
Every blood stained night, slit wrist,
Was not enough to make you stay,

Build -
You built me up just to watch me fall,
Now he will do the same to you,
I always promised I'd get my revenge,
And now my dreams come true,
My dreams come true.

[Breakdown]
Is this what you wanted?
A life of failure and self-disgust,
Is this what you wanted?
Your life's a monument to lust,
I can never bring myself,
To think of what went wrong,
When I look at you I feel nothing,
And where I stand is where I belong,

[Breakdown Again]
Suffer in the sickness you've adored,
Smothered in the plague, you are reborn,

[Chorus]
I swore my life forever yours,
But you chose to turn the other way,
Every blood stained night, slit wrist,
Was not enough to make you stay,
These black clouds still follow me,
I have seen them every day,
Broken dreams are all life is,
And I swear this on my grave.
