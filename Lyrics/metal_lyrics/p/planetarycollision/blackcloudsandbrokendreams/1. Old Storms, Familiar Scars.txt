[Verse 1]
I always wanted you to be the one,
There was nothing under the sun,
To stop me, Prince Charming's world wasn't far from a dream,
Or so it seemed,
But that all washed away,
Like the moon underneath the midnight rain,
This game you play, has driven me insane,
I've spent countless days, thinking I may find my way,
Time may heal your pain, but nothing can bleach your stain,

[Chorus]
I have grown to learn, time spent with you was a waste,
Though weâve died I've been reborn, I hear you in this storm,
What that means, I don't know anymore,
You walked away to see true color in this life,
But still we see in black and white!

[Verse 2]
Over the years gone by,
Slower than waiting for your God to show a sign,
If I've learned anything, the waiting game's for those with nothing left inside,
Just a moment's what it takes,
To leave this life behind,
And I find myself fading,
As I dream of the days you were mine,

[Chorus]
I have grown to learn, time spent with you was a waste,
Though weâve died I've been reborn, I hear you in this storm,
What that means, I don't know anymore,
You walked away, you walked away, and now you're gone..

[Break]
With you out of my life, I can have a voice of my own,
I'll never live for someone else, my soul's turned to stone,

[Chorus]
Time spent with you was a waste,
Though weâve have died I've been reborn,
I hear you in this storm,
What that means, I don't know anymore,
You walked away to see true color in this life,
But still we see in black in white.

[Break]
Now that you're gone, every day in this life I still question if I am alive, and that I am okay,
I swear to myself that I am, but was it all a dream, was it all in my head,
Am I the one who's crazy? Running all out of time,
I find myself slipping as I dream of the days you were mine.
