[Verse 1]
You told me I'll never beâ¦
All that I want to be,
All you did was tear me down,
I could've stayed but I chose to run,
For me,
I'll never live like you again,
I'd rather live alone than spend my life in regret,
And all you are is "I'm not good enough,"
I've learned your ways you'll never stand up

[Chorus]
Remember who was holding your hand,
When the world turned against you,
And no one would understand,
Every single night, we both know that I was right,
And thought you've left me here tonight, just know,
I never gave up on this fight,

[Verse 2]
Since you've left my life,
I've learned to love myself,
Through all my failure,
Since the day you said goodbye,
I've realized it was all lies,
You didn't even try,

I should open my eyes and see,
That there is more to life than regret and grief,
And I know this pain will fade,
I should open my mind and believe,
That there's more than an empty shell to me,
The clouds won't always be grey,

[Break]
(From the bottom of my heart, these words are sincere,
I'm just waiting for the skies to clear.)

[Verse 3]
The saddest part is we'll never know,
The "greatest" story ever told,
We walk away in ignorance,
Never considering the "what ifs"
What weâve considered "too far gone"
Could all be changed in one phone call,
A walk of life forever dark,
Because we chose to lose it all,
Good riddance; I'm finally fine by myself,
I do not need another's help,
You said you wanted me to be happy,
I'm happy now.

[Hook]
I can do this by myself,
There is life in someone else,
I can do this by myself,
Without you: without my living hell,

[End]
To think I wasted my time,
I will never shed another tear
To think I wasted my time,
I will never shed a tear for you
For every raindrop, another lie from your lips,
I have made it out of this
