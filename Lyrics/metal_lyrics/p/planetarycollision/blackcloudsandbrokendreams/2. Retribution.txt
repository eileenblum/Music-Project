[Verse 1]
All the things, you've ever said to me, and I mean,
Everything, I remember every single spoken,
Word of hate, is coming back to you someday,
Karma has got a bullet for your brain,
Today, I take control of my life, and I decide
My fate, and nothing's going to stop me,
I will write the book of my life in your blood,
The guillotine's in motion, you've nowhere left to run,

[Chorus]
The image in the mirror,
Scared to show its face,
Are you ashamed of who you are?
Retribution screams your name,
Put the razor to your wrist,
And don't you cry a single tear,
This is depression manifest,
Time to face your fucking fears,

[Verse 2]
I'm ashamed to say that I once cared,
The depression, unending, I've no escape,
Take a look at the people around you,
You can see them, but can you see their face?
Can you look me in the eyes and say,
That your happy, wasting your life away.

[Chorus]
The image in the mirror,
Scared to show its face,
Are you ashamed of who you are?
Retribution screams your name,
Put the razor to your wrist,
And don't you cry a single tear,
This is depression manifest,
Time to face your fucking fears,

[End]
This is retribution; this is the end of lies,
As blood pours from your body, your evil justified,
This is retribution; this is the end of lies,
A life ruined in return, eye for a fucking eye.
