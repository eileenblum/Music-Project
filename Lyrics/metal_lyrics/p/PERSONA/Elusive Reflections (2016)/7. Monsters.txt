I know your disguise
Mind so full lies
The truth you pushed aside
The promise you denied

Look at your reflection
You'll see just deception
Intentions unclear
Goals so insincere

Promise breaking
Lies resounding
Plea you're faking
Makes me sick, so

Insincere, so
Damn untrue, it's
More than clear now
This is finally you

I know your disguise
Mind so full lies
The truth you pushed aside
The promise you denied

Look at your reflection
You'll see just deception
Intentions unclear
Goals so insincere

Indignation
I must bear and
This vexation
Lead me nowhere

No remorse and
No more blame
This spite is yours
Not part of who I am

I know your disguise
Mind so full lies
The truth you pushed aside
The promise you denied

Look at your reflection
You'll see just deception
Intentions unclear
Goals so insincere

I, I will go on and confide in my fate
No one can take that away
You, you'll stay forever imprisoned in your hate
Forever broken and astray

Fate
Trust
Hate
Lust

I will go on
You'll stay forever imprisoned

Tear up your disguise
Sink into your lies
Drown in all that is wrong
That's where you belong

I'll fight all your malice
Learn from this injustice
Stay strong on my path
And I promise you that
