Everything you know
Everything you've seen
Everywhere you'll go and
Everywhere you've been

You are here to leave a trace
You are here to make it all come true

Brought into this world to be awake
You are never given more than you can take
Never be afraid, your soul's untied
Listen to the voice inside

Everyone you love
Everyone you meet
All you're dreaming of
All that's incomplete

They won't wait if you hesitate
Take this day and make it all come true

Never be afraid you'll go too far
Only broken hopes will leave you scars
That is all you'll have if you don't take
Every chance you get and free yourself

Now all that you have
Forgotten years
Forgotten sighs
Hovering tears

All that you are
Forgotten name
Forgotten smile
Echoing blame

All that you hear
Forgotten voice
Drawing you near

Give up your fears
Give up regrets and live
Take this day and make it all come true
