There was a land
Far on the shore
Hidden and lost
And cursed evermore
No one could smile
And no one could feel the joy
Again

Far in that land
A young man was born
Came to the world
Destined and sworn
To take away all sadness
And bring the joy again

Hear my call
Feel my heart
I'll keep you safe
In this time where we're apart
I reach for your hand
I dream of your eyes
I pray for you to come back
From the sea of fallen stars

There was a land
Far on the shore
Hidden and lost
And cursed evermore
No one could smile
And no one could feel the joy
Again

Hear my call
Feel my heart
I'll keep you safe
In this time where we're apart
I reach for your hand
I dream of your eyes
I pray for you to come back
From the sea of fallen stars

And I've been waiting all these years
I have been crying out my eyes
Pouring out all my tears
Into the sea of fallen stars
