In the mirror of my past
There's a girl I used to know
She's the face I live without
And the soul that I disowned

Now I'm falling through her eyes
While her whisper lingers on
It's a voice I recognize
Oh, begging to come home

I'm back
Inside
Where I've been living before
And I can't hide
From voices anymore

They know
My name
The one I cannot recall
And who's to blame
For mask that has to fall

Now she wants me to confess
Every role I've ever played
Every mask that I possess
Every name that I betrayed

But the shadow of my soul
Says it's late to make amends
And it's more than I can stand
Oh, this is where it ends

I want
To be
The one who opens the door
To set her free
The one forevermore

She screams
My name
The one I'll never recall
And I'm to blame
The mask will never fall

I'm falling
Reaching for the light
I'm dreaming
Calling you

I'm fighting
Memories feelings
I'm burning
Losing all

When this moment takes me out
You will stand there on your own
Tearing up disguise
All the faces I have worn

And I'm drowning in your hands
Just a stranger made of glass
If I could live again...
