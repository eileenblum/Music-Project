Here it comes another day
To go through same emotions
So indifferent so unkind
It's not what we planned

When it happened why it changed
We slipped without a notion
Pointless efforts useless tries
I can't understand

How we came to this place
With so many lies we need to erase

How to find a purpose in this
Mess of fake expressions
Look at us I can't believe
We're falling apart

Foundering
All together gone forever
Holding onto years we lost for good

We're spinning around
And all these lies are bringing me down

Foundering
All together gone forever
I just want it all to disappear
To fade away
To let it go
To free myself
