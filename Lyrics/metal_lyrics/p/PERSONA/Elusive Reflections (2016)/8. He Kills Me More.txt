He wants me to change my ways
He wants to be saved again
Now he asked me to stay the same
Yet he still saves himself away

I've seen no lights into his eyes
I've found no love into his soul, he gives me more
He's found his ways down to my depths
And uses me against myself
He kills me more

Shallow heart sees no emotions yet tries to seize the day
A notion it fails to grasp, for all is shades of gray
As the years go by maybe tomorrow will bring
A change, for you
Use a last one

I've seen no lights into his eyes
I've found no love into his soul he gives me more
He's found his ways down to my depths
And uses me against myself
He kills me more

Images burning, screaming...
The lights out make them dreadfully alive...
When does this circle of beginnings and endings become synchronized?
I sink and yearn and pour all my essence into its void...
It holds me firmly in its arms and leaves me no sigh,
But makes me scream for you... Forever...
