Smile
I never wanted to be
In a place where
I could love you feel you
Trust you with my soul

Love
Always wanted to be
Unrelated
Always searching wanting
Bleeding for you

I could never say things
I always wanted to say
It's never
Torn forever

I could never love
This person I wanted to be
Just never
Torn forever

I never wanted to be
In a place where
I could love you feel you
Trust you with my soul

Love
Always wanted to be
Unrelated
Always searching wanting
Bleeding for you

I could never say things
I always wanted to say
It's never
Torn forever

I could never love
This person I wanted to be
Just never
Torn forever

Can you find a way
To make it disappear and
Can you find a way
To make it bleed for me

Can you find a way
To make it real and beating
Can you give me back
My peace of mind

I could never say things
I always wanted to say
It's never
Torn forever

I could never love
This person I wanted to be
Just never
Torn forever
