Locked in my mind under my skin
I buried every trace
All that is lost I'll never regain
And I cannot replace

Was it me who denied
How twisted truth became
Was it you who just smiled
While I was falling

Every thought every word
I just believed it
Never a doubt not even a sign
That I was losing all
Blinded

With every breath with every move
This maze becomes so real
Imprisoned and lost enchanted and fooled
By things I'll never feel

Where's the start where's the end
When lies begin to play
No escape from this land
And no salvation

Release me, why I'm still spinning around
Inside your mind..

Forget me

Every thought every word
I just believed it
Lost in your smile drowned in your eyes
I couldn't feel it

Torn and insane confounded and blind
I found my way to live
Soon you will learn what I've become
And I will not forgive


Every thought every word
I just believed it
Lost in your smile drowned in your eyes
I couldn't feel it

Torn and insane confounded and blind
I found my way to live
Soon you will learn what I've become
And I will not forgive

And I will not forgive
