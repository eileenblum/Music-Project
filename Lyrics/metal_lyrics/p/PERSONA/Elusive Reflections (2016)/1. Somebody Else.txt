Hey
Who are you today
In this phony play
Can you remember your name

Someone else's eyes
Someone else's mind
You're trying to be cause you

Think it makes you better
Feel it makes you stronger

You will always fail in
Being someone else, your
True self will prevail, why
Don't you try to
Just be yourself

Don't be somebody else

Why
Do you always see someone you'd
Like to be
Rather than you'd be yourself

Just the way you are
You're the perfect face
You are the perfect

Mind, all you
Need is right inside you
Throw away this cover
Trust your inner power

You will always fail in
Being someone else, your
True self will prevail, why
Don't you try to
Just be yourself

Yourself, don't be somebody else

Embrace who you are
You have to believe
That's all that you need
There's no one else

Embrace who you are
You have to believe
That's all that you need
There's no one else

Throw away this cover
Trust your inner power
No one else can be yourself
And you're the one to be

You will always fail in
Being someone else, your
True self will prevail, why
Don't you try to
Just be yourself

Yourself, don't be somebody else
