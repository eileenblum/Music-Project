How to fight
Another day
Lost in dreams
Lost in this emptiness

I can't feel
I don't want to stay
Numb like this
Trapped in the mess
Where it all

It all sounds like you
It takes me back

Now,
Now you're wind
Now you're rain
Ageless wings
Born again

You're the light
Roaming free
Timeless love
You'll always be

All I am
Fragments within
Make me whole
Take me, transform all this

Nothingness
The void in my soul
Find a place
Give me one moment where I

I fall into you again
And I can cry

Now
Now you're wind
Now you're rain
Ageless wings
Born again

You're the light
Roaming free
Timeless love
You'll always be

You'll forever
Breathe within me
Smile at me when
I can't bear this

Sun without you,
This unfading sorrow,
These shards I became

Now
Now you're wind
Now you're rain
Ageless wings
Born again

You're the light
Roaming free
Timeless love
You'll always be

You're the light
Shining star
Timeless force
The love you are
