[feat. James Cheal Of Beyond Broken]I am who I am
I follow my dreams
I live for today
Bow down to me

I am who I am
I follow my dreams
I live for today
I am my own king

I will rise from the hollow grave they buried me in
And I'll make them see that I am undefeated

I'll push myself until I reach the end of me
I'll make them see that they know nothing about me

It's time to close this chapter and begin on a new one
This is who I am and I don't give a fuck about your opinion

No, I don't give a fuck

You think you're something more than a pathetic waste of space
Now you're just wasting my time, get the fuck out of my way
You're just another pile of shit I need to step across
No, you mean nothing to me

You mean nothing to me

You are not the first and you will never be the last
You're no fucking different to the failures in my past
Did you really think that words of hate would ever be enough?
Bitch, all you motherfuckers are my motivation

You mean nothing to me

I will rise from the hollow grave they buried me in
