I never knew that beauty could be so fucking ugly
How everything could be hidden behind a face
And now that I know what you did behind my back
I will never take you back again

Take you back again

The more I look into her eyes
The more I start to feel
The more I look into my past
The more I start to think

What if I turned my back?
Would you be whole again?

I will never take you back to the place that we called home
You burned all the bridges and now you're on your own
I don't know what I need to satisfy you
You make me feel like I'm nothing, nothing to you

Nothing to you

The more I'm breathing her lies
The more I start to believe
The more I look into my past
The more I start to think
