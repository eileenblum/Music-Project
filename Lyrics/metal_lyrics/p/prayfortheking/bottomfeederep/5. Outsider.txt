[feat. Shawn O'brien Of Above This]You're sinking
You're drowning
There's no need for hoping

I remember the time when I had these thoughts
Convinced that I had nothing to live for
But here I stand with life in my hands
And I've never been this thankful before

I've told you once
I've told you twice
I'm a man
Not a mouse

You're sinking
You're drowning
There's no need for hoping

You can make it through
You've got nothing to lose
Don't ever let the haters be the end of you

I need closure from this world of posers
Feel my pain and sorrow for a distant tomorrow

Say anything you want
Make them believe your lies
Just know that I get what I want
I told you to fucking stop

I told you to fucking stop

It's the quiet ones you've got to look out for

Every time I come around this motherfucking town
People wanna run their little stereotypical mouths

So run your fucking mouths

I've told you once
I've told you twice
I'm a man
Not a mouse

They poison you
They consume you
They come for you
They live off you

You're sinking
You're drowning
There's no need for hoping

I'm trying
You're crying

Pick yourself up the ocean floor
Open the fucking door
To a life of so much more
