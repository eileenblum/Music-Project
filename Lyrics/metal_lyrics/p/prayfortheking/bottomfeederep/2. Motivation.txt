Your existence makes me proud
You stand here and so do I
I won't waste a second of my life
I'm here to live, I'm here to die

What's in your past is behind your back now
So don't be scared of living
Love every breath you're taking

You got nothing to regret
You got the future in your hands

Take the challenges in life with pride
Follow your heart and do what's right

Your existence makes me proud
You stand here and so do I
I won't waste a second of my life
I'm here to live, I'm here to die

What's in your past is behind your back now
So don't be scared of living
Love every breath you're taking

Your existence makes me proud
You stand here and so do I
I won't waste a second of my life
I'm here to live, I'm here to die

And I enjoy my fucking life
