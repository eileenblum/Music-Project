Years of prolonged bitterness
Have worn me down
I saw this day coming
I've never felt this sick in my life

Growing mad with suspicion
Deep down inside it's certain
I dread the days to come
This game will end tonight

[chorus]
For what you did and what you left undone
You are truly dead to me now

For what you did and what you left undone
You are truly dead to me now

Just names remain
Name of true hate
Your dead heart
How the hell did I fall in love

Just names remain
Name of true hate
Your dead heart
How the hell did I fall in love

In heartbreaking dreams I kill you and our son
Defenceless, innocent, hence he dies unborn
Blind hate paves the way to destruction
Seals the end of life
Only shame remains as bloody wounds
On your lover and his whore

[chorus]

"I could have been a father, raise you as my son
of all my mistakes in life, this cannot be undone
she could have been a mother, love you as our son
yet chose to break our trinity, and now all hope is gone"
