All alone eternity in our heads
Questions Without meaning falling
Merciless is the call of the sleep
Whenever dark is near

All the screams have been silenced
Reason fell beyond nothingness
Blinding pain nowhere to catch
Weakness soft to the core

I lie in the bend of nails
Scars bleeding pain of the memories
I drink my fears
And behold what I've become

Whenever dark draws near
Fears raise their evil echoes
Whenever dark draws near
Silent cries haunt my mind

Hate ripping me apart
I despise this self hatred
I can't accept the help that you offer
My life has no meaning
