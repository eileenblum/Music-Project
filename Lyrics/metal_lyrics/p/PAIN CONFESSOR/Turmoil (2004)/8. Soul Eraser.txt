You're soul eraser
Nothing's conceived through pain
My rage, my anger
No life is lived through hate

Every flower has a lifespan from a seed to it's withered end
Your beauty lasts as long as love is selfisness
Do you know me, do you know where i came from?
End this existence for all i care
There's nothing within me now

The end, the razor
Your words are salt for my wounds
My absolution
The sweet words erase away my wounds

I make amends to the world
With no fear in my heart

I wasted love, i forgot to live
I wish to bury your lies
And accept that you are

I wasted love, i forgot to live
I wish to bury your lies
And accept that you are

Soul eraser
Erase your soul
You're soul eraser

Every flower has a lifespan from a seed to it's withered end
Your beauty lasts as long as love is selfisness
Do you know me, do you know where i came from?
End this existence for all i care
There's nothing within me now

I wasted love, i forgot to live
I wish to bury your lies
And accept that you are

Soul eraser
Erase your soul
You're soul eraser
It never kneeled down for you
