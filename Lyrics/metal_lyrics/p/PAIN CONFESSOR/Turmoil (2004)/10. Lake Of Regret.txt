Respect, we breathe it like a drowning man drawing his last breath
Regret, we washed away our religions in the lake of regret

Shallow, shallow minds do horrible deeds
Eyes sewn shut through anguish, betrayal taught through pain
Never ending dream to wash away our religions
I never say that is a dream
I wash my purity away in the lake of regret

Belief, the deeper it goes the less it matters what you believe in
Never forget that you are your own god

Shallow, shallow minds do horrible deeds
Eyes sewn shut through anguish, betrayal taught through pain
Never ending dream to wash away our religions
I never say that is a dream
I wash my purity away in the lake of regret

My faith will never rise from the lake of regret

All this holiness
That you regreted
Let cold water wash away
This man made God

Eyes sewn shut through anguish, betrayal taught through pain
Never ending dream to wash away our religions
I never say that is a dream
I wash my purity away in the lake of regret

Eyes sewn shut through anguish, betrayal taught through pain
Never ending dream to wash away our religions
I never say that is a dream
I wash my purity away in the lake of regret
