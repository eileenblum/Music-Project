Living with the deepest uncertainty they cry to the wind
Trying to shake the desperation off themselves dying rapidly inside
Feel the heat growing and burning your bones through
Unbearable decaying mourning I will never surrender

They challenged all raging against opinions of doubt
Killing everything on their way

No one shall recall
No one shall recall
They are fiery thorns
They are fiery thorns

Emptiness is crushing inside
The blood will turn cold
And it's punishment for all those
Mistakes of the most unhappy life
Love turning into jealous justice
Final confession buried dreams and the buried life
Fiery hell of souls lives forever

They challenged all raging against opinions of doubt
Killing everything on their way

No one shall recall
No one shall recall

Acts we never meant to be sworn to cherish the life between
Thousand questions satisfied answers
This fiery hell of souls lives forever

They are fiery thorns
They are fiery thorns
