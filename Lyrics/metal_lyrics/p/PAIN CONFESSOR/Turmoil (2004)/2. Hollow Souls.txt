We must sin to sin more, swallow the tears of shame

Seize the voice of unbound
Something from beyond
Feel without bleeding through wounds
Neverending pain, take hold on the rush
Exit within

Make every deed count, no one else left to blame

Praise those who don't fear
Leave the earthly being
Hell descending from inside
Never catching the vanity
Of those who believe
Their false insanity

The cold touch of all life
To shake perfection of inner dissection
War of hate for pity of mind
Armored to stand against

The cold touch of all life
To shake perfection of inner dissection
War of hate for pity of mind

Words of mouth can't respect
Watching down on our hollow souls
The meaning of silence
Watching down on our hollow souls

Words of mouth can't respect
The meaning of silence
Wordful of past
Watching down on our hollow souls
Victims of imagination
Building confidence to rot alive
Watching down on our hollow souls
