Fates are twisting and turning
Erased of empathy
Forcefed with suffering
Diseased by apathy

Torn again to feed more flesh to the machines of hate
Torn again to feed more flesh to the machines of hate

Words are cutting and burning
Tongues are razorsharp
Eyes are tools for killing
A view of a bitter mind

Torn again to feed more flesh to the machines of hate
Torn again to feed more flesh to the machines of hate

Would you fight for today?
Do you struggle for the past?
Do I fight for my life?
I refuse to struggle in our past!
Would I fall today?
Should I die inside?
All that's left is the will to fight for my life

Twist the knife
Twist the words
Turn dead inside
Turn colder and ask yourself

Would you fight for today?
Do you struggle for the past?
Do I fight for my life?
I refuse to struggle in our past!
Would I fall today?
Should I die inside?
All that's left is the will to fight for my life
