Nobody wants to know you
You have only yourself to blame
You have betrayed me, this anger burns in my soul
It wants to break out tearing your weak soul apart

You're fresh out of friends, you shall open the gates of pain
We're sick of your lies, you have only yourself to blame

Have some courage, your tears are a waste of good suffering
You're in my shackles and I will never end your pain
You have betrayed me, one last lie, one last time
It wants to break out tearing your weak soul apart

You shall open the gates of pain
You have only yourself to blame
Feel my hatred
You are in the shackles of pain
You have only yourself to blame

Nobody wants to know you
You have only yourself to blame
You have betrayed me, this anger burns in my soul
It wants to break out tearing your weak soul apart

You shall open the gates of pain
You have only yourself to blame
Feel my hatred
You are in the shackles of pain
You have only yourself to blame

You're fresh out of friends, you shall open the gates of pain
We're sick of your lies, you have only yourself to blame

You're fresh out of friends, you shall open the gates of pain
We're sick of your lies, you have only yourself to blame
