Why is it so complicated to realize living in human hell?
How is it possible to never be finished by the thoughts which fell under the spell

Impossible to avoid bleeding inside
Soul built to feel outside
Inner peace, most lethal weapon of them all
Word of relations, lies of passion

All those thoughts that we tried to hide
We will die, we are forever alone
We take two steps closer to hell
And make the mistake of being born into this world
We sign our destiny to be alone...
