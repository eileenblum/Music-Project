You travel to the darkest corners of your mind
There's no telling what you might find
Uncertainties are appealing in disguise
Excitement, a toxin

No need for you to seek adventures
They will find you, all the same
When you least expect commotion
They will catch you off your guard

Perfection is now defiled, by your hands time is stained
No need to fear for scars, these wounds will bleed forever
No need to fear for scars, these wounds will bleed forever

Inflamed anger, cut the blood from flowing
Stream of bile will tranquil my fury
Infected caption, a twisted portrait
Bleed me dry until the end of time

What lies behind the stare, beneath the rage
Greeting arms, lying eyes open wide
A glance inside your ward of sins
Endear a hollow gaze

Perfection is now defiled, by your hands time is stained
No need to fear for scars, these wounds will bleed forever
No need to fear for scars, these wounds will bleed forever

Seek thyself in reasons' stead
Break down the boundaries within
Swallow the debris of life
Constructing your harness of pain
Repulsive vomit of sickness
Like sparkling acid on your tongue
Is the bitter taste of all that is low
'Cause what you reap is what you sow

'Cause what you reap is what you sow
'Cause what you reap is what you sow
