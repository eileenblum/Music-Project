They revere only empty words
I denounce this twisted world
Our seeking of more has blinded us
I cast myself out!

A growing hatred towards this sick world
Where wealth defines a man's worth
The weakling rats ruin everything
Then burn their own homes for a smoke screen

Sarcastic, hey I am a cynic
No other way to speak these days
Rid myself of this so called reality
I cast myself out!

Here in the vortex of echoes I find myself lost
No confession to atone for my rebellion
Here in the vortex of forsaken souls I let myself go
I cast myself out so no other can

Rabid dogs were once put down
Now the madmen run the asylum
Your polluted life sickens me
I cast myself out!

Bless you for showing me the door
So I know where we step outside
The gloves come off and we meet at last
Eye to eye, like man and beast always have

Here in the vortex of echoes I find myself lost
No confession to atone for my rebellion
Here in the vortex of forsaken souls I let myself go
I cast myself out so no other can

Breathing in your poisoned kingdom is like choking on gravel
I want to tear off my skin and run into the rain

Here in the vortex of echoes I find myself lost
No confession to atone for my rebellion
Here in the vortex of forsaken souls I let myself go
I cast myself out so no other can

No confession to atone for my rebellion
In the vortex of forsaken souls I let myself go
