A little girl on the field
With no worries in the world
Shall see a war, a revolution
Even a better tomorrow
New found peace brought you
This all new love and life
You were to have children
Worked hard to provide
Must be so lonely in that darkness
No one will ever know what carries your mind from here to eternity

You can't quite remember those friendly faces that are near
But so afar, with hearts so close to touch
All clouds have silver lining, yet yours is all black
To keep away all memories and their flowing tears

Your mind now a tarnished halo, that shines while their whole world falls

In all the life's turmoil you lasted and prevailed
Conquered a new meaning
With grandchildren in your name
Then something burrowed itself into your soul
Veiling the spirit once strong enough to repel war
No one will ever know who takes your mind from here to eternity

You can't quite remember those friendly faces that are near
But so afar, with hearts so close to touch
All clouds have silver lining, yet yours is all black
To keep away all memories and their flowing tears

Your mind now a tarnished halo, that shines while their whole world falls
And as the rust eats away last hope, the walls come down and you see

Your knight in shining armor
Taken from you so long ago
Why were you left behind to suffer
In this accursed limbo
Laying at the end of the line
Waiting for him to come

Your mind now a shining halo
That shines when they keep you close to heart
As the rust slowly fades away
And the young girl falls to sleep
