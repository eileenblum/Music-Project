So few times the words come out
Our hearts bleed like stone
So we lie until our sorrow is deeper than a dried well
But the real grief comes only at the end

How many times did we leave the fallen behind
To drag ourselves into an early grave
How many promises did we really have to break
To finally break our own petrified shame

We row this grim river to say goodbye
That shadowed delta was that last farewell
To have known you, the most I could ever ask
To have you walk by my side

"I will try... I will try and walk alone"

We get to spend time with our loved ones only once
Yet we often bid farewell in haste
This time I will say I am sorry for all those times I did not
Please forgive me

We row this grim river to say goodbye
That shadowed delta was that last farewell
To have known you, the most I could ever ask
To have you walk by my side

We row this grim river to say goodbye
That shadowed delta was that last farewell
To have known you, the most I could ever ask
To have you walk by my side

We row this grim river to say goodbye
We row this grim river to say goodbye
