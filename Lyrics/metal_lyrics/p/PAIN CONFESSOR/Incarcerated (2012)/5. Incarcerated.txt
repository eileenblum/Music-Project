Mistake number one was I didn't listen to my father
I didn't tell anyone my twisted and scary thoughts
And one day I do it
I didn't realize
How cruel a man can be
To spill innocent blood

Mistake number two, I didn't believe my mother
Who had seen the err of her ways, my heart turned black as coal
Today I do it
Bring down the hand that defied me
Cursed be the betrayer
Ashes to ashes, lust to dust

A guilty soul will soar
When the brick walls fall
With heavy wings tried
A stone heavy heart will fly

Mistake number three was I did what others told me to
I didn't give a chance to my own diluted reason
On that day I did it
Just to get back at them
To show I am the strongest link
Without their decrepit chain

Nothing will bring back what is lost
Nothing was more lost than I
Nothing will bring back what is lost
Nothing was more lost than I
Nothing will bring back what is lost
Nothing was more lost than I

A guilty soul will soar
When the brick walls fall
With heavy wings tried
A stone heavy heart will fly
