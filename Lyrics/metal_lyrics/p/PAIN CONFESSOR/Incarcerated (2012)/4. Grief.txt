Repentance won't justify the crimes you have done
You should've been enslain
Took life from your own flesh and blood
Pure blood now flows forever

There are no words for these murders
You should die...
You should die yourself

Innocent child, too short a life, the end touched us all
We should open our eyes
Innocent mind, still growing and learning to understand
Now that's all torn away

There is no name for this grief

What was so wrong in your mind
Didn't you have a heart?
Will someone explain
Nothing remains the same

Depression is not a reason for murdering your children
You should've rotten in jail
Life's drain and confusion is not for them
You should have just killed yourself

What hurt you so much, what made you fail?
No reason you say will do, or undo
What you have done
Torment and pain
It is not strength, what can be taken away

What was so wrong in your mind
Didn't you have a heart?
Will someone explain
Nothing remains the same

And we lay this sorrow to rest
As the bodies already burn
There is no name for this grief
And we lay this sorrow to rest
As the bodies already burn

What can we do to stop these murders
So our children can live and love
Life is a gift and joy to all
No one should take it away

There are no words for these murders
You should die yourself
