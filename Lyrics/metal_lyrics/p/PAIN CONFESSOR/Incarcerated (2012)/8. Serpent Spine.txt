I hold within my grasp the true way
To sway the misguided, lead on the lost
I break those that have broken
I take apart that which is whole
Slither along my serpent spine, find shelter in my shadow
Carry my flame into the night, spread my truth like wildfire

In the house of shattered mirrors
Nothing is black and white
Truth bends and finally breaks
To fend off the beasts, one becomes a beast
Slither along my serpent spine, find shelter in my shadow
Carry my flame into the night, spread my truth like wildfire

When the world needed a hero
I introduced them a villain
To make a better world I burned what's left of mine
I stared into the abyss and the deep gazed into me

I hold within my grasp the true way
To sway the misguided, lead on the lost
I break those that are already broken
I take apart that which is whole

When the world needed a hero
I introduced them a villain
To make a better world I burned what's left of mine
I stared into the abyss and the deep gazed into me

To make a better world I burned what's left of mine
I stared into the abyss and the deep gazed into me

When the world needed a hero
I introduced them a villain
To make a better world I burned what's left of mine
I stared into the abyss and the deep gazed into me
