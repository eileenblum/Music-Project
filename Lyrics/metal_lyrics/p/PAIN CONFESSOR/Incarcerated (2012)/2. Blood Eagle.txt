With the power of your gods or childhood abuse
Reaper, the taker of life

Black lamb of god, I spit on your grave
Each day I will count the bricks
I smile like the devil you were

How can you stare in the mirror
After breaking my soul
Did it make you feel empowered
How can you go about your life
With my rended flesh torn

I will see you burn, you took what is mine, emptiness remains
I will reclaim every drop of my blood, drawn by weakling scum

How can you crawl on like nothing happened
Everything happened to me
How the hell could I get up again
When my knees were bent as was my will

With your cuts in my skin
And your hate in my veins
Spread your wings like the blood eagle
Take your last breaths as you burn
As your ravaged angel
I will help you soar

How can they stand behind each other
As a crowd that always shows up at a funeral
Not to weep but to gawk at the corpse
Tear apart every last shred of humanity

I will see you burn, you took what is mine, emptiness remains
I will reclaim every drop of my blood, drawn by weakling scum

Burn, burn!
Burn, burn!

I will see you burn, you took what is mine, emptiness remains
I will reclaim every drop of my blood, drawn by weakling scum

With your cuts in my skin
And your hate in my veins
Spread your wings like the blood eagle
Take your last breaths as you burn
As your ravaged angel
I will help you soar
