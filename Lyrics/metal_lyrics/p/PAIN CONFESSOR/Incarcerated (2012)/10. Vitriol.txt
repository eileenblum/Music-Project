Like an outcast pariah
A soul without a shelter
All my youth I struggled with rage
And though it would never end
From within the darkness that clouded me
I saw a shimmer that lit up the skies
And for the very first time I knew
That my life had meaning

I walk into a new dawn
As the darkness divides
And reveals an all new light
That blinds me and makes me alive
There's no more room for hate
No room for selfish pride
Flowing with vitriol no more

I stand here with my soul bare before you
Just one look and there is no weakness left in me
To rise and fall for you
I am the armor to protect
I am the salve to heal

This lonely, battered soul, seeking peaceful haven
Scarred and burnt for life, please let me stay for a while

There's no more I
No room for selfish me
Just the patron's vigour
And a promise to keep
There's no more room for hate
Farewell to tortured spite
I cannot find myself lost in rancour
No more

I stand here with my soul bare before you
Just one look and there is no weakness left in me
To rise and fall for you
I am the armor to protect
I am the salve to heal

This lonely, battered soul, seeking peaceful haven
Scarred and burnt for life, please let me stay for a while

I... I stand here with my soul bare before you
Just one look and there is no weakness left in me
To rise and fall for you
I am the armor to protect

I stand here with my soul bare before you
Just one look and there is no weakness left in me
To rise and fall for you
I am the armor to protect
I am the salve to heal
