Tonight, I don't wanna be me
I live in a dreamworld
It seems to be inevitable
Expect more things to fail
Next gasp of breath, next perfect way
To prevail...
I shall be reborn in this moment
Don't wanna die in vain...

If I could find chivalry
In those moments when I crack and fall
Rise and stand against the wall
And no one knows I can see it all
So many times I've seen it break
Tonight, I carry the cape of fear
Since love's the only thing that can't hate
Hate is the last shadow I wear

Tonight, I ease my restless soul
While my body lies in flaming torment
It's a long way to turn around
When death is just another door
...Just another door...

I keep those things safe in my head
That should not be
Tonight, I leave them under lock and key
Killing of time begins
My mind wanders, my soul aches
Shall I be afraid?
Should I stand my ground and stay?
Leave the weak behind and survive

Tonight, I ease my restless soul
While my body lies in flaming torment
It's a long way to turn around
When death is just another door
...Just another door...

I close yet another door
In every struggle I feel insecure
Close my mind to stay awake
In the last eye of the storm
