You are my everything
I would draw down the moon for you
Given the love and all the trust
What we have I am dying to lose
It kills me to see you lying there
I am strong in my faith
Every damn second taking you away
I am nothing before this fate

Inhale the will to live, exhale the dying cold
The more you die each day, I die a little each night
As a man, my love is just a word
No power can stop us from dying
As a god, my love would change it all
My love could bring you to life

Paralyzed with fear to rely on hope
Too weak with nothing to be done
Tempted with ways to defy nature
Forsake my soul to save her

I will inject myself with this divine DNA
To reject my salvation for one more life
To stop the time right here, right now

Fear of losing loved ones, fear of being left behind
Anger against mortality, clear mind obsolete
Give me a way to go beyond
Become something more, become a god
If I can't cure a cancer I must cure humanity

Paralyzed with fear to rely on hope
Too weak with nothing to be done
Tempted with ways to defy nature
Forsake my soul to save her

I will inject myself with this divine DNA
To reject my salvation for one more life
To stop the time right here, right now

I changed myself to preserve you
To save us I rejected our salvation
