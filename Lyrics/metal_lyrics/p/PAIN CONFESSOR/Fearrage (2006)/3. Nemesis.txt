He is insect among gods
With strength to dehtrone all
A tool of hate with no soul
Driven by a dead black heart

Lacerated and torn human shell
Walking on the burnt bridges
Carved in his battered flesh
A mantra of human kindred

"To forgive is noble but vengeance is power"

Nothing can stop this nemesis
Every lie reconciled
Judging us from above
Cauterizing feelings inside

A false deity congregation
Kneeling down for absolution
Last rites and confession
Prosecution and execution

"To love someone leads us into oblivion"

Would you still hold me if I was the one
Born out of the rivers of blood?
Would you still love me all over again
If you could stop the end?

Others are born of fire
Destined to burn forever
With lust for something, never to find
I stare at the wall against which I will die
I carve these words into my flesh as I cry:
Why can't my aching soul retire?

"To forgive is noble, but vengeance is power"

Would you still hold me if I was the one
Born out of the rivers of blood?
Would you still love me all over again
If you could stop the end?
Would you still love me all over again?
