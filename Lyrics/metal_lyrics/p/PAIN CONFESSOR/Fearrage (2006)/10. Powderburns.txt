Now understand this, wretch
I tore my heart in two
Let's take a glimpse inside me
All traces lead to you

Shredding your way into another man's flesh
Crush and burn the smoldering ruin to start fresh
A sea of empty souls to harvest this barren crop
Without hesitation all blindfolded and shot

No matter where I look I see all life end
Nothing we sow will ever grow into grace

We are the powderburns in your hands
A silenced death, a whisper, a memory of past

A field of fallen victims we have to bear in our minds
A graveyard of broken hearts, forlorn loved ones

No matter where I look I see all life end
Nothing we sow will ever grow into grace

We are the powderburns in your hands
A silenced death, a whisper, a memory of past
We are the powderburns in your hands
A lie, a whisper, a turned page at last

How do you sleep at night
After all you've done?
Joy and woe enshrined
A statue made of flesh and bone undone

We are the powderburns in your hands
A sack of dust, a whisper, a memory of past
We are the powderburns in your hands
A lie, a whisper, a turned page at last

Telltale snake eyes
Give away you, twisted ghoul
A gangrene ridden heart
Spreading poison blood into my very soul
