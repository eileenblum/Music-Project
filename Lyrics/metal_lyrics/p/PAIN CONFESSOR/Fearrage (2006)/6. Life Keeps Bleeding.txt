I have challenged
All the nameless fears, lost within the cause
In my darkest place
I have born and died, risen above all ashes
Yesterday's mistake
Nevertheless casualties, victims of coincidence

Please make me an honest man
Choose my weapons, choose my fate
Lose my shadows, burn my hate
Yesterday's mistake
Nevertheless casualties, victims of coincidence

I must survive this ordeal
Since only the dead see the end of dying
And life keeps bleeding thru' ageless wounds...
...of joy and despair... bleeding on and on

What I can't see
Mind can't make it real
At last I see my soul bleed
When the deed is done
When the smoke has gone
I stand my ground proud and tall

I must survive this ordeal
Since only the dead see the end of dying
And life keeps bleeding thru' ageless wounds...
...of joy and despair... bleeding on and on
