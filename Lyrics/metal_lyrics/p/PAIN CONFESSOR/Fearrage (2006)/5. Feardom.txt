Ravenblack hair whips the shadowed wall
Dusk swirls around her
Temptation has arrived with fall
The true fall of man

In here many have loved
And given into hatred
A tomb of all things living
And a grave for all things dead
(We come here to die)

Bloodred cape sweeps the ancient floor
Tiled with vanity
Fear is here, master of this hall

(Feardom) Beggars in the halls of king fear

Flames lick the roof above
Bearing time like we carry our crosses
Guilt is here, burning like the sun

Blue eyes stare at the convention
This meeting of betrayers
Truth is before the beholder
Grim truth we all know but deny

In here many have loved
And given into hatred
A tomb of all things living
And a grave for all things dead
(We come here to die)

Greatest of all kneel before him
Fear breaks the strongest one
Forged inside mind, embedded inside heart

(Feardom) Ages cannot hide what we are
(Feardom) Beggars in the halls of king fear
Grave of love

Seal me inside this tomb
Leave out all things I hold dear
Entomb me inside my mind
Abandoned in the kingdom of fear
