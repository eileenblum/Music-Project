Your words will never change
To tell the truth, you can never change
You're trying to rule our lives
But remember you can't be someone's king
Take a close look at yourself and
See your stupidity

Your pathetic little soul
Only capable to destroy

You, show your face and come out from shadows
Prepare, I unleashed hell for you
We all can smell your fear
Now we know you can't be healed

I promise someday my hate and rage will
Face your lies
Why don't you try to find help for yourself

Your pathetic little soul
Only capable to destroy

You, show your face and come out from shadows
Prepare, I unleashed hell for you
We all can smell your fear
Now we know you can't be healed

I thought you were my friend
I thought you'd understand

What the hell are you thinking?
Can't you see you are going down?

You, show your face and come out from shadows
Prepare, I unleashed hell for you
We all can smell your fear
Now we know you can't be healed

I thought you were my friend
I thought you'd understand
