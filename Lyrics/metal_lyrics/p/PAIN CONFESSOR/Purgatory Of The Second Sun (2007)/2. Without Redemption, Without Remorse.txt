Your faith is that great
How much pain you can take
When we become dreamless
To stand lead rain

How much can fallen crawl
Before the truth itself

Between the lies of fear
We rise and fall and fall
We repent, we pray
That is the way we work

One try forward, two right back
Discontent, unspeakable act
Greatest devilry is in the deeds of men
In the thoughts of matter

Now! I ask you all
Without redemption, without remorse
Do you dare to fall with me
Do you dare to fall with me

Sometimes we find ourselves
Being something weâre not

Dead donât have any hope
Only welcoming void
Your faith is that great
How much pain you can take

One try forward, two right back
Discontent, unspeakable act
Greatest devilry is in the deeds of men
In the thoughts of matter

Now! I ask you all
Without redemption, without remorse
Do you dare to fall with me
Do you dare to fall with me
