This is the world I hate
Everything is built by wars with minds of greed
We are slaves, our lives not worth living
Itâs time to kill
Kill all your thoughts
Do it now erase your will
That is what they want

Sick twisted circle we tread on the ground
Year after year
Searching deeper and deeper for answers
To mend our minds
Dreaming for something better
That will never carry on
Dreaming a life that will never be this hard

We all are mercenaries paid to fight someone elseâs war
We all are mercenaries fighting just to survive

We feel our lives grow weaker day after day
Sometimes we think of ending all
Still we try to carry on
Itâs time to kill
Kill all your thoughts, do it now
Erase your will
That is what they want

We all are mercenaries paid to fight someone elseâs war
We all are mercenaries fighting just to survive

I have lost my dignity
I donât pray to a god, it never worked
âCause thereâs nothing to believe

We all are mercenaries paid to fight someone elseâs war
We all are mercenaries fighting just to survive
