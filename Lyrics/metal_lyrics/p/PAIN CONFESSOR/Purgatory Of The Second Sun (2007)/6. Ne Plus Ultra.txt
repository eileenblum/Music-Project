From within genetic memory
A hunger arises
To master all skills
To wield unlimited power

Dreams are blown away like autumn leaves
Rain will keep on falling when Iâm gone

To leave a mark and make it last
Explore every way to excel
Nothing will stand in the way of perfection
Leave natural weakness behind

Greatness comes with great pain
Sound of reason must be silenced
One man canât change evolution
I must rise above all

My enemies will fall
When a new dawn
Of ultimate life
Has arrived
Flawless, second to none
Perfection ready to rise

Dreams are blown away like autumn leaves
Rain will keep on falling when Iâm gone
Will no one recall my name
When years have sealed me into the ground

Greatness comes with great pain
Sound of reason has been silenced
No man can stop evolution
We must rise above all

My enemies will fall
When a new dawn
Of ultimate life
Has arrived
Flawless, second to none
Perfection ready to rise

Dreams are blown away like autumn leaves
Rain will keep on falling when Iâm gone
Will no one recall my name
When years have sealed me into the ground

I am someone, I am someone
I am someone, I was someone
