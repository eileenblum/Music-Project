Frantically lost, through the wastelands
Among the people with no name
We scarred the earth
With the sound of life decay
Those weary daffodils
Never looked so utterly lonely

Withering away before my eyes
Nothing but a sighâ¦
In the loneliness of the dark
At the both ends of the path
We stare back at our memories
Do we deserve our tears
For the justice of others

And the accidents never happened
Only malicious intents
The aftermath has begun
Purgatory of the second sun
Burn! Sunfire!!
Sunfire! Burn!!!!

âTil the morning breaks
And we suddenly wake up dead
Those dishonest streets
So we crowded and forgot
Give us the timeless reward
For the mindless games we play

And the accidents never happened
Only malicious intents
The aftermath has begun
Purgatory of the second sun
Burn! Sunfire!!
Sunfire! Burn!!!!
