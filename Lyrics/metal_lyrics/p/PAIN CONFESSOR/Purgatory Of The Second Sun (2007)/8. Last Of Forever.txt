Next dawn of rude awakening
Can bring me my rage
Another sleeps through
The change of seasons

I follow my flow of emotions
And we shall meet again
So I laugh my tears of madness
For all to see, Iâm a thief with a smile

Thereâs those times I canât move my feet
Carry myself one step from another
Tired of my reflections
Behind my mask I grin

Shall we see the last of forever
When we canât stand the heat of the moment
Weâre asking everlasting forgiveness
Heal our consuming greed

I follow my flow of emotions
And we shall meet again
So I laugh my tears of madness
For all to see, Iâm a thief with a smile

My thirst grows ever on
I only want to live everything
My mind judges all
My bliss is to ask- becoming of the roll of fate

Shall we see the last of forever
When we canât stand the heat of the moment
Weâre asking everlasting forgiveness
Heal our consuming greed
