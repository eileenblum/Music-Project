A fist to crush the dreamer
They bloom like cancer from poison seeds
Behold the nightmare live
To devour the mind that dreams

âI was but one of the manyâ

Sleep your sleep of endless beauty
Forever hold your peace
I revealed my secrets
Now I watch my dreams die

Darkened lords of bad dreams
They destroy the harmony
Every word they speak
Erases a lifelong journey
A poet hates his beloved
Spring dies in the hands of winter
Soul that once saw beauty
Now sees decayed despair

Sleep your sleep of endless beauty
Forever hold your peace
I revealed my secrets
Now I watch my dreams die

Cloud cities vaporized
Hope trampled by hornless unicorns
Pyres burning
Immolating the last of wise words
Everything is alright
Consolation now without meaning
Falling angel weeps tears when utopia ends

Sleep your sleep of endless beauty
Forever hold your peace
I revealed my secrets
Now I watch my dreams die

We revealed our secrets
Now we see our dreams die
