The final tournament's waiting for me!
Another step in the circle of time
And so I get to the final trial
Another battle to win has begun

I kill my enemies but I'm too weak
The only law for me is to be tough!
"The only law for you now is fighting"
The princess' voice is trying to keep me alive

My mind is drowning deep in the darkness
My doubts have grown why does it happen to me?
My mind is drowning deep in the darkness
My doubts have grown is it the end of my dreams?

Blood and faith deep inside my heart
Blood and faith burning in my eyes 
Blood and faith deep inside my soul
Blood and faith for my golden sword!

In front of me there's the last warrior
This mortal fight shows who's the strongest one
But I'm so tired and my fear is growing
Is it the last step of my glorious life?

"My lord search for the light!"
Heal me princess my guide
My task has reached the end
I can hear the call of my fate
It's not over!

My mind is growing out of the darkness 
My doubts have gone I can't believe what I see
My mind is growing out of the darkness
My doubts have gone now I believe in my dreams
