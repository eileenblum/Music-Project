How many soldiers march on the field so quickly
They seem so angry and wild
They chase a young girl that runs away
So frightened they take her prisioner!

[Soldiers:]
"Stop Lilith Dove you Satan's whore kneel in the face of God
Guilt is in your name nothing left to say seize the witch away"

Tied up and hooded like a lamb she cries out
Words that I don't understand
They flog and chain her to stake like a demon
It's just an awful mistake!

Shameful lies darken her innocent eyes
Silent cries comin' from her innocent eyes

She must be saved! I take my sword to fight
I drown those hangmen in blood
But one dart shooted by a wretch hits my back
Is this my doom mistress death?
