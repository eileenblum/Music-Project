So I rise and find myself aboard
Of this massive ship
Everywhere I can see
Tough men at arms

There's another battle ship
It is so far away
But it's sailing on to us rapidly
Someone gives me one bow
Men are screaming "hail to Rome!"
We're ready to start the battle has come

By my warrior soul
I'll start fighting for 
Everyone who's in this ship
I start to sing
My battle hymn

The wind is swelling all the sails
And the sea is so rough 
Our mighty ship is getting near 
The enemies' craft 

At a certain moment 
We hear a deafening noise
Ramming then was just the only choice 
So begins the boarding 
Everywhere fire blood and death
I will emulate the deeds of my father king

I will fight in the morning light
When the sea is reflecting the golden sun
I will fight in the morning light
I kill everyone who wants to bar my way
I will fight in the morning light
My warrior soul defeats every sword today
