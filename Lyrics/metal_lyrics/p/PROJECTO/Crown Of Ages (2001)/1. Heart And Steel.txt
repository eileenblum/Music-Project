[The King:]
"We are here to celebrate
The gods are my son
For the holy crown of time
We sing ancient songs"

But the wind's voice howls
And the storm is raging near
Then a lightning falls
And a ghost appears

[Dhian:]
"Here I am I understand
killing the pain it's now my aim
I will fight day and night
Heart and steel my kingdom's will"

The black sorcerer talks to me:
"You're the chosen one
You must set my spirit free
From the curse upon me
Evilness will come
From the deepest sands of time
You can save your world
If I'm by your side"
