Now my mind is clear 
The light washed my doubts away
I've been used betrayed!
And how many lies I hear!

I will stop this game
Now I know the way 
Time has come

But something holds me back
I fear for my princess' fate
Tell me lady
How can I soothe your pain?

Can I stop this game?
Let me know the way
Time has come

[Princess:]
"In the crown of ages
Time contains its pages 
Abusing its power a man can prevail 
And rule us!
In the crown of ages 
Time contains its pages 
Let's break this power a man can't prevail
And rule us!

Don't be afraid my lord
My soul will be free again 
When you'll break my chains 
I will fly away! I'll go home!

We can stop this game
Yes! We know the way
Time has come"
