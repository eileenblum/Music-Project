A long time ago I was a young princess
I lived in happiness
Guilty of being a victim of fate
Because I have loved too late 

My father and king sold me as sacrifice
In honour of the evil ring

When I was here in this place called the crown
I saw nobody around
Only a man singing a litany
To wipe out my destiny

But I don't know I don't understand
A flash hit him and all the land

It's the thunder of love
That has saved my soul
Then I'm here in the crown
With no direction
It's the thunder of love
That has saved my soul

Then I'm here and wait for
My salvation
