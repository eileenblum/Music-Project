I fly in a sky that I don't know
On a strange "steel bird"
I cry out some other creatures shoot fire
I can't use my sword

I must fight in the sky 
Like a big dragon
I must fight in the sky
Fire with fire

Every "bird" starts up a dance of death
Around me in the air
I fear but I'm too quick and I attack
Using the gun

My "steel bird" is struck and I fall down
Really to fast to fast
The creatures behind the earth is too near
So now will I die?
But I must react now I take the gun
And so I shoot fire
I'll kill everyone the dragons are dead
The glory is mine

I come back 'cause I'm tired and confused
Towards the base
But now a dark smoke invades all the "bird"
I must close my eyes:
