His name was cursed
Damned for eternity
So he bowed down to the light
Hoping it would set him free
For years he walked
Among the angels
For years he thought
They would have the answers

But seeds of evil
Plant strong and poisoness roots
And as the time passed by
The heavens saw the serpentine
And so their fear was born
And so they kept away
With scornful eyes they left him behind
Out cold to decay

He became so full of wrath
In a frustrated state of mind
Every attempt to win their hearts
Would leave them full of scars
And so the heavens wept
And so the angels cried
With torn and bleeding wings
One by one fell from the sky

They were like lambs
Lambs sent to slaughter
Just standing still and waiting
For the wolf's hunger
To drain a part
Of the mighty river
The river of his damnation
The black flowing curse

So now he wanders
Through eternity alone
Himself is his only home
Morbid,evil,twisted home
He shall never find his peace
He's a plague,he's a diseace
He shall bring you down on your knees
If your paths shall cross
