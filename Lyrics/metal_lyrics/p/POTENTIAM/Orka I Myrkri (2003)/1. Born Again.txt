In the solitude of wilderness
They walked towards the sun
Peaceful eyes awaiting grace
Speaking words never heard
Gathered as one in a single thought
They touched the sky wich left them blind
The illusion of life was realized

Once silent sun,now spoke to them
Envoke the energy once adored
This is the law they never saw
A prayer of despair
(will)Leave them dead

Now their faces turned to stone
Disbelief of circumstance
Carefully you should walk the narrow path of mystery

Watch them take their final breath
Forgiving faces of repend
Attacked by a vicious world
Fragile souls,that day were born again
