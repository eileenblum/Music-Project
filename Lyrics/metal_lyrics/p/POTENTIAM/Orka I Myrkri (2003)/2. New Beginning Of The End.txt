Alone in the silent night
I heard their screams inside
Crying out for help
But noone listened

The demon within I refused to let go of
For I loved it's sins
It showed me the pleasures of suffering
Those beutiful dreams,
That turned into nightmares
Those wonderful moments
That crumbled to dust

And I am a soul of all and nothing
Cosmical reality,wich they call insanity

With a mindraping torment
I surrendered my beliefs
To this dying fairytale

I have fallen and risen again
Stronger every time
Awaiting the step that would lead us to tragedy
Conquer all fears and to make it devine
I have eaten the forbidden fruits
And burned down the bairnaked tree
By that I close a chapter of a misery
Foretold in my dreams
