Mother,you gave us life
Mother,we betrayed you
A lonely mind cries for you
As you feed on my blood 
Without you there would be no us
And without us,
all memories of you existence would die
Why are they so blind?
Why can't they see?
What is reality worth,
if they can't use it to see your pain?

When I'm gone I beg you to set my soul on fire!

Mother,where is my death?
Mother,why do I still have to see you suffer?
Now you carry my blood in you darkest veins
There it will flow until end of time
