Again,surfacing shadows
Again,darker each time 
I have seen them go through planets
Following the rise of day
But still they will not leave me
Harnest only the smallest moment
Capture it all

Stab me thousand of times
When order becomes chaotic
A human end

Just to look the emptiness
To witness the purity of a soul
Now forcing a sight
Freedom appears
Feeding it's slavery

Now only time awaits...
