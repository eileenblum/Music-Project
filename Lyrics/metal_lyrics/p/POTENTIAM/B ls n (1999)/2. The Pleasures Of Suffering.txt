Carry me across your lands
Where their souls will burn before my eyes
Into your majestic flames
Let me hear their loud and painful cries

Show me what it is to suffer
without my body and mind
Grant me the past again
Guide me through the night
Bring before me my destiny

Haunted by the unknown souls
Deeds of past destroyed and sealed my fate
Cursed in time of wantering
All those nights,they planted seeds of hate

Should they dare to cross my path again
Invade my burning treasure
My curse would perhaps end
But still they would meet my revenge
For all this time of boiling wrath
When the gate opens,they all shall die
