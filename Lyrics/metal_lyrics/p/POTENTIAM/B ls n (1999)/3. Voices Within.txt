A quest for knowlegde begins
Seek the truth behind the words

The more I see,the less I know
Let my torments become free
Why they hunt my soul,I do not know
Risen above all life I am

Visions of the world,come to me...

I am a gun that shoots the world
With emotions for powder
Creation for barrel
Creation...Let my emotions free

Son of the sun,watch me burn
Watching tomorrow come,watching all die
Beyond the sea,my thought came free
Oh sealed powers,I am with thee
