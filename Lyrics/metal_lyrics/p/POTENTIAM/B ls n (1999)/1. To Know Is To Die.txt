What is it that brings me this hate?
Only night calms me down
The days are long in the shades
But with you I wear my crown
Nothing matters now,
I have no life to wake up to
Darkness showed me our true world. 

They live in the sunrise,they live in the day
But when they sleep,you take me away
Night come forth,embrace me
Silently we meet,yet thunder strikes my ears

My flesh in flames
My spirit,fleeing from life
Is suicide my only key?
For no longer can my mind decieve

To many secrets of thine I know
Within the mystical night I will go
They live in the sunrise,they live in the day
But when they sleep,you take me away
