Moon,how beutiful you are
I drift away into your dimensions
and drown in your wisdom
For you have seen what noone has seen
For you have been where noone has ever been

Oh moon,take me away
So I can be among those above
But they broke my wings
Before I learned to fly...

He who blessed my soul
Shall soon be met by death!

Haunting spirit,lit thine fire tonight
I want to feel all your hell inside
Mystical stars,
Grant me your unholiest blessings

Bölvað sért þú,
Æsis bál
Snöggt fyrir haturs geð
Og allt það illt þú ætlar mér
Snúist aftur til hæla þér
