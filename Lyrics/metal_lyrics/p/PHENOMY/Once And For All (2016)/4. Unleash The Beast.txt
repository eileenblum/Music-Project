Look to these eyes
Burns deep inside
An anger that consumes you
Grows stronger every night
Wreck your soul shattered hope
And the hatred forever remains
No mercy no remorse
Awaits you here only pain

Don't run, don't hide
Unleash the beast inside
Nothing will ever stop you
You must fight to survive

Don't run, don't hide
Unleash the beast inside
Nothing will ever stop you
You must fight to survive

Break through these walls
You've been trapped for years
No one will ever save you
Surpass all your fears
No one is here to listen
No matter how hard you try
You must fight and not surrender
You cannot deny your pride

Don't run, don't hide
Unleash the beast inside
Nothing will ever stop you
You must fight to survive

Don't run, don't hide
Unleash the beast inside
Nothing will ever stop you
You must fight to survive
