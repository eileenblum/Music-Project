Break off! Dance no more,
Danger is at the door
Misled by tyranny,
Men sacrificed for victory
Bullets flying all around,
Fill the fields blood is on the ground
Peace is now in our hands,
Bringing war to take on the land

Cities burning down to ashes,
Nothing remains
The world rumbles and crashes,
Now chaos reigns
Under these ruins darkness is spelled
Under these ruins they have laid to rest
Under these ruins all hope is gone
Under these ruins damage is done

Blackened clouds beneath the sky
They have battled eye for eye
Another grave another soldier,
Buried down six feet under
No more heroes no more savior,
No more courage no more honor
They fall one after one, until they die

Cities burning down to ashes,
Nothing remains
The world rumbles and crashes,
Now chaos reigns
Under these ruins darkness is spelled
Under these ruins they have laid to rest
Under these ruins all hope is gone
Under these ruins damage is done

Cities burning down to ashes,
Nothing remains
The world rumbles and crashes,
Now chaos reigns

Under these ruins darkness is spelled
Under these ruins they have laid to rest
Under these ruins all hope is gone
Under these ruins damage is done

Under these ruins darkness is spelled
Under these ruins they have laid to rest
Under these ruins all hope is gone
Under these ruins damage is done
