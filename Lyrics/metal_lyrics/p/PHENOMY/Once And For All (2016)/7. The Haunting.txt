What the hell am I doing here
Watching my life disappear
Among the creatures of the night
Where darkness reigns and kills the light
Where the dead come back to life
Your greatest fears are realized
You try to run but you can't hide
You will be found your end is nigh

Watching angels falling
Hearing demons screaming
They are calling my name
Welcome to the haunting

Where the flames cover all the sky
Scenes of violence come fill my eyes
As the world come to an end
Children cry while devils dance
Surrounded by these closing walls
Trapped in a maze of endless halls
All your prayers will remain unheard
All that remains is a blistered earth

Watching angels falling
Hearing demons screaming
They are calling my name
Welcome to the haunting

Now it's the time, to pay for your sins
The gavel is down, there's no way to run
The end is near, so grim so true so real!

Watching your life end quickly
Suffering hopelessly
There are the things that should not be
Tormented endlessly
Eyes open as you gasp for air
Waking up in another realm
A place for hope not for despair
Away from your haunted nightmares
