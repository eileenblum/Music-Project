Welcome, to the hell of madness
Welcome, to the seed of wrath
No way there will lead you out
Nothing will change your path

When the lightning
Flows through your veins
There's nothing more you can do
Death penalty has been pulled for you
Only hell awaits

Because you're locked (electrified)
And you're shocked (electrified)
You will die (electrified)
Old sparky shall testify

Because you're locked (electrified)
And you're shocked (electrified)
You will die (electrified)
Old sparky shall testify

Welcome, to the room of nightmares
Welcome, to the chamber of pain
Say your prayers, but it's too late
Death is hanging in the air

When the lightning
Flows through your veins
There's nothing more you can do
Death penalty has been pulled for you
Only hell awaits

[4x]
Because you're locked (electrified)
And you're shocked (electrified)
You will die (electrified)
Old sparky shall testify

Welcome to your last ride
Welcome, to the electric chair
Your sins have claimed this throne
That will take away your life

When the lightning
Flows through your veins
There's nothing more you can do
Death penalty has been pulled for you
Only hell awaits

Because you're locked (electrified)
And you're shocked (electrified)
You will die (electrified)
Old sparky shall testify

Because you're locked (electrified)
And you're shocked (electrified)
You will die (electrified)
Old sparky shall testify
