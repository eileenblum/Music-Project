Behold a pale horse;
And his name that sat on him was death
And Hell followed with him...

I am the final darkness the eternal rest
The one who leads the blessed or damned
I am your greatest fear
Your darkest nightmare
The clock is ticking your time is next

You can't escape your fate
You can't evade
You can't restrain
You can't avoid his rage
Death will always remain

You can't bribe the reaper
You can't change your destiny
Your soul belongs to the gate keeper
Come and greet your sealing fate

I, all mighty and vengeful
Will show no mercy to the rich or poor
I, reaper of spirits Collector of souls
Nothing satisfies me no wealth or gold

You can't escape your fate
You can't evade
You can't restrain
You can't avoid his rage
Death will always remain

You can't bribe the reaper
You can't change your destiny
Your soul belongs to the gate keeper
Come and greet your sealing fate

I'll fix your feet 'til you can't walk
I'll lock your jaw so you can't talk
I'll close your eyes so you can't see
This very hour you're coming with me

I'll fix your feet 'til you can't walk
I'll lock your jaw so you can't talk
I'll close your eyes so you can't see
This very hour you're coming with me

I, the executioner the judge and jury
The king of the dead I am
Death none can excel
I'll open the gates to Heaven or Hell

You can't escape your fate
You can't evade
You can't restrain
You can't avoid his rage
Death will always remain

You can't bribe the reaper
You can't change your destiny
Your soul belongs to the gate keeper
Come and greet your sealing fate

You can't bribe the reaper
You can't change your destiny
Your soul belongs to the gate keeper
Come and greet your sealing fate

So you think you can bribe the reaper
Can you bribe the reaper motherfucker
