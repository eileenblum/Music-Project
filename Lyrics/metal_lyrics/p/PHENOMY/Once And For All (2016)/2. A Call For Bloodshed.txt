Born in this hell
our dreams they devour
Your life they will sell
and steal what is ours
Caged inside a cell
where minutes become hours
In slavery we dwell
Our loss becomes their power

I choose to live not to exist,
Not to fail but to resist
I won't be denied once again
(Won't be left behind)
Nothing to lose death is a gain
We will fight until the end
Hammer of justice painted red
This is a call for bloodshed

Anarchists we've been called
With rebel souls we have fought
Fighting this war with mutiny
Thousands have died with dignity
The blessed are now to be damned
Their rules are now to be banned
Waving this flag of freedom
This world is now our kingdom

I choose to live not to exist,
Not to fail but to resist
I won't be denied once again
(Won't be left behind)
Nothing to lose death is a gain
We will fight until the end
Hammer of justice painted red
This is a call for bloodshed

The war is waged,
Prepare yourselves to fight
March to the backlash
We stand here to defy

I choose to live not to exist,
Not to fail but to resist
I won't be denied once again
(Won't be left behind)
Nothing to lose death is a gain
We will fight until the end
Hammer of justice painted red
This is a call for bloodshed
