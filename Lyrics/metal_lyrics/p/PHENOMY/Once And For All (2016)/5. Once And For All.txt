How many lives can they take
Do we watch until we break
How many homes will they burn
Do we wait until it's our turn
How many dreams will they scatter
Until our hopes are shattered
Do we accept our fate
Or do we stand before it's too late

Rise! It's the time to change
Rise! It's the time to repent
Rise! Shall we stand tall
Once and for all

How many lies can we hold
Is the truth will ever be told
How many years will they waste
Do we spend them all with hate
How many times will we endure
This curse that has no cure
Do we run and do we hide
Or do we fight side by side

Rise! It's the time to change
Rise! It's the time to repent
Rise! Shall we stand tall
Once and for all

Rise! It's the time to change
Rise! It's the time to repent
Rise! Shall we stand tall
Once and for all

Rise! It's the time to change
Rise! It's the time to repent
Rise! Shall we stand tall
Once and for all

21st century and still there is no rest
Just how long will it be until we breathe again
21st century and still there is no rest
Just how long will it be until we're freed again

Rise! It's the time to change
Rise! It's the time to repent
Rise! Shall we stand tall
Once and for all

Rise! It's the time to change
Rise! It's the time to repent
Rise! Shall we stand tall
Once and for all
