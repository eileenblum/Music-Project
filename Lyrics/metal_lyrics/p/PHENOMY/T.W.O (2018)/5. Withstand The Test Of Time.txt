To walk through the wire
To rise from the fire
Recover from the blows defeat all the foes
Break the chains and march through the rain

Oh through hardship reign
Oh through struggle and pain
Oh through death revive
Withstand the test of time

To hold back the tears
To face all your fears
With strength and with pride conquer the lies
Take on the night and reach the other side
