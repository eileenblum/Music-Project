Within the tides come unveil the lies
Reveal what must have been
Walking through the darkness
Searching for the light
Sailing through a sea of sin
Have you seen the misery, the blood that was shed
Brother killed brother, children left unfed
In gold we trust a world misled
For nation's fall we dread

I have seen the atrocity I have heard the screams
I have touched the fragile skin I have felt the scars bleeding

Father time is crying mother earth is dying
One day the price will be paid
Memories filled by regrets we're lost in disarray
Rules we follow orders we obey led us all astray
No winning hand in this no man's land
Nothing left for me

Let the rain wash away all the sins of yesterday
All the blood that's on my hands the fresh hot proof that I am damned
Let the rain wash away all the sins of yesterday
All the blood spread in vein take away the endless pain

Will we see tomorrow is why we kneel and pray
Tempted by evil hatred primeval
We live to become the prey
No matter the number no matter the price
One day we will break these chains
Destroy the borders threaten the world order
All against the strain
