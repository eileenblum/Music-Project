The value of a man
Long lost in time
Every story told is a lie
Every fortune is the result of a crime
Still we stand next in line

End this life
End this nightmare
End this warfare inside my head
Realign, redesign, recreate a new life

This flag we bore forevermore
Our final destination
Mother cried and brother died
For your emancipation
Wounds of war still raw and sore
Observing their elation
The final price for paradise
You and I, we sacrifice

Where do we go when we depend
On laws decreed by lawless men
The signs on the wall says equality
For all colors of skin

My blood signs in for freedom
A trade for a peace of mind
A final change of season
A kingdom so divine

I have turned away
From mankind's shame
Where thoughts are judged
And we're the ones to blame
Man killed man for lust and greed
Humanity fell from grace
