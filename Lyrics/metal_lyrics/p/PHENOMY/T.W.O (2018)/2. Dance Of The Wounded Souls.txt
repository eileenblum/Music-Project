On through the dead of night
They shot them one and all
They thought they stopped the dance
As they watched elders fall
The bullets set them free fulfill the prophecy
Immortals, through death
They found eternity

Violent beats come and shake the earth
Swaying to the rhythm of the beast
Step into the final dance behold
The dance of the wounded souls

Breakthrough the realms of death
Arise the vengeful souls
They hunt and seek revenge
As they watched tyrants fall
In the valley of misery
Remains a mystery
Where the wounded souls shall dance eternally

Dance motherfuckers dance!!

I've seen it all, heaven and hell
There is no difference, no forgiving
What is evil but good tortured
By its own hunger and thirst
