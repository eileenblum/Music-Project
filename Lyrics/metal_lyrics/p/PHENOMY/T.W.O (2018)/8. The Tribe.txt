Gather around gather around the flag
Gather around straight and tall
Build the shrine with might and pride
And let us vow that we'll never fall
Let's defend the right to be free
Equality for you and me
No more tyranny no more slavery

The price for freedom is never free
We must fight to gain it's sight

Gather around gather around to defy
Gather around and fight
If we should all die tonight
Let us die together
Our final act our last rites
And remember the afterlife
Gather now the tribe

This is not the end
Death is just a new beginning
This is not the end
