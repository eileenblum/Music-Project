This is the last rebellion the fire you can't control
These are the faces of the lost when life has taken its toll
This is a call for battle flesh armed by the heart
This is the soul that never knows when to stop

Fear not death and the darkness it holds
Fear not the unknown
Fear not to fight on through it all
You'll never walk alone

This is the dead awaken flawless and reborn
This is the march for mutiny the reckless stronghold
This is a tale of conquest the wildest uproar
This is the sound of dissonance the final downfall

Give me a reason why do we come to join the dead
No rhyme no reason we are broken and beaten and left for dead

These are the dreams forsaken living in the shadows
This is the anger of the beaten the language of the righteous
This is the eye that sees the truth inside the lies they told
This is the cry for justice a call for freedom
