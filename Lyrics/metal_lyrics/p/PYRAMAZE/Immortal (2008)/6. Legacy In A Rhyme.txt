Come fly away with me
close your eyes and find
a place between dream and reality

That's where I live
that's where I breathe
oceans of creation...
Heart for the heartless

Remember me,in vain I did not suffer
And the pain won't hurt me anymore
Remember me,and I am forever
I gave my everything and I still do my love
Let me bleed for you

I know how to make a sacrifice
I am the poet with the bloody knife

What I have seen
Where I have been
The life that I created
A miracle indeed

Remember me,in vain I did not suffer
And the pain won't hurt me anymore
Remember me,and I am forever
I gave my everything and I still do my love
Let me bleed for you

No time to waste,only time to treasure
And I do every second of every hour
(Remember me my love,I am forever)
Creating a memory with words of mine
(Remember me my love,I bleed for you)
My love,my life,my legacy in a rhyme
(Remember me my love,I am forever)

(Remember me my love,I bleed for you)
(Remember me my love,I am forever)

No time to waste,only time to treasure
Creating the memories that will last forever
The sounds and the pictures that echo through time
My love,my life,
My Legacy In A Rhyme
