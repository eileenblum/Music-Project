See what stands before us
legions of men
basking in this moment
prepared we make our stand

Arrows let fly
you can not see the sun
as they crest it blacks out
hope that we might live
warriors cry
we will not retreat
we will light the way
we will fight our way
to the end

This life is fleeting
no words can express
how we feel in the now
as the darkness consumes
we all have sworn
that there's no turning back
we will fight
to a beautiful death

Side by side in battle
the phalanx is our strength
my brothers blood is my blood
our enemy is tyranny

Arrows let fly
you can not see the sun
as they crest it blacks out
hope that we might live
warriors cry
we will not retreat
we will light the way
we will fight our way
to the end

Instinct takes over
extinction is not sought
the fire that burns in us
magic nor pride
our sacrifice
will be carved in forever
we'll live on
through a beautiful death

Arrows let fly
you can not see the sun
as they crest it blacks out
hope that we might live
warriors cry
we will not retreat
we will light the way
we will fight our way
to the end
