Born as a twin close to the twilight hour
my brother's body so weak and thirsting for power

The gift was cruel
an uneven start, meant to tear us apart
but in our lives there must be a purpose

I will gaze to the future
let I be revealed, no mans fate is sealed
but I wonder what will become of us

In the land of dragons we walk side by side
love not returned, trust never earned
but brothers till the end
In the land of dragons we walk side by side
love not returned, trust never earned
but brothers till the end

Power of the body and force of the mind
like the book and the story-teller we are two of a kind

I feel your rage my brother
our blood is the same, in our kin lies no shame
you must rein your thirst for power, before it's too late

What we do defines who we are
in this lies the beauty and the beast
don't let your hatred be unleashed

In the land of dragons we walk side by side
love not returned, trust never earned
but brothers till the end
In the land of dragons we walk side by side
love not returned, trust never earned
but brothers till the end
