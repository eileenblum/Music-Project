A blink of an eye, and the scenery changed
no longer safe, surroundings rearranged

The nightmare has come
to give me uneasy sleep
I scream to be awake
but my dream's to deep

Another night in the land of fear
it draws me near
I'm no coward, I'm fighting and bleeding
the mare has found me once again
a storm rages in my mind
the dark has left me blind

When sanity is hanging by a thread
my own cries wake me, lying in my bed

After the battle
after all is said and done
I still feel the pain
an I the only one

Another night in the land of fear
it draws me near

Nightmare's coming, fangs are biting
cold hands clutching around my throat
nightmare's sound me, all around me
unspoken horror steals my covers

I'm no coward, I'm fighting and bleeding
the mare has found me once again
a storm rages in my mind
the dark has left me blind
