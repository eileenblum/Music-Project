Mind the bogs between night and day
will-o-the-wisp will lead you astray
dusk has come and shadows grow long
the hour of ghosts and their luring song

On your own you'll feel the fear
of a thousand years
What is right, what is wrong?
when you see the ghosts light in the marshes
Stand your ground till it's done

Elemental, spook or fairy
no one knows but wise is the wary

Traveler in the dark, you seek the treasure or the way
the flame of the ghost will guide you or tempt you
until the light of day
Traveler in the dark, you seek the treasure or the way
the walking fire will recede if you follow
until the light of day

Hear the unknown, it whispers your name
the glow so enchanting, so warm is the flame
those who have followed are said to be lost
you may solve its riddlebut at what cost?

In the dark all light seems kind nut not all doors
are there to enter
let it burn in solitude, an elusive guest
in lonely splendour

Elemental, spook or fairy
no one knows but wise is the wary

Traveler in the dark, you seek the treasure or the way
the flame of the ghost will guide you or tempt you
until the light of day
Traveler in the dark, you seek the treasure or the way
the walking fire will recede if you follow
until the light of day

Twilight songs from age to age
across the sea from land to land
skin shall shiver, hearts shall rage
when you feel the ghost lights chant

Traveler in the dark, you seek the treasure or the way
the flame of the ghost will guide you or tempt you
until the light of day
