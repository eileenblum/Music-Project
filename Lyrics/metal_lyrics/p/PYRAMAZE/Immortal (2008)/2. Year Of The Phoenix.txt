The time has come, the stars aligned
it's meant to be, I see the signs
out of the ashes, of beauty and power
a new beginning, this is the hour

Thirsty souls bound by the silence
shall be reborn by their own story
and when the voices have risen
we will seal this pact of resurrecting glory

This is the year of the phoenix
let all legends come to life
turn the silence into thunder
believe in one more wonder

Out of the old let the new arise
forged in fire stronger than demise

Another season has come and gone
there will be another one
with true intents we march forever
always striving to be better

Within the elusive dreamer
slumbers a beauty almost pale
now awakened and renewed
creating another haunting tale

This is the year of the phoenix
let all legends come to life
turn the silence into thunder
believe in one more wonder
