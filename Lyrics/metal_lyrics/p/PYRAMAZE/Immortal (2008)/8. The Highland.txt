Highland green you know my heart
a life under open skies
the scent so different out here in the wild
a land so fair where the free eagle flies

I could walk here a thousand years
your beauty will never grow old
the rain that caresses my face
will never make me feel cold
inside I will never feel cold

Stranded in a fairytale
where's the lady of the lake
the white deer that eludes the hunter
are they here, I wonder

Highland green you know my heart
nothing can ever tear us apart
longing for your simple ways
fill my dreams, steal my days

Call me a clansman if I am of worth
a child of bygone days
a promise of serenity
is what you give to me
to me

For my your thunder is a friend
and lightning so innocent

Gladly I'm heeding your call
my fortune is always to see
our ways are connected
an elusive place deep in me
a place deep in me

Stranded in a fairytale
where's the lady of the lake
the white deer that eludes the hunter
are they here, I wonder

Highland green you know my heart
nothing can ever tear us apart
longing for your simple ways
fill my dreams, steal my days

Call me a clansman if I am of worth
a child of bygone days
a promise of serenity
is made for me

From the mountain top
to the valleys so deep
your promise cleanses me
it is mine to keep

Highland green you know my heart
nothing can ever tear us apart
longing for your simple ways
fill my dreams, steal my days
