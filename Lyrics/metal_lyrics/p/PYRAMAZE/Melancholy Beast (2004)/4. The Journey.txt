[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

I feel it's hands on me
Constantly pulling me
On and on

It haunts me when I sleep
A burning longing dream
More and more
War of the mind

How can I deny
Questions of faith
Or a question of time
There it is clearly
Written here for me

Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night

The path lies open wide
It's up to me to glide
Through the maze

I have the will to see
My turn to break free
Glorious

War of the mind
How can I deny
Questions of faith
Or a question of time
There it is clearly
Written here for me

Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night

And at the journeys end
Then I will surely stand
More victorious than I've ever been

[Guitar / keyboard solo]

Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
Days go by, still I try
To realize the journey haunting me a night
