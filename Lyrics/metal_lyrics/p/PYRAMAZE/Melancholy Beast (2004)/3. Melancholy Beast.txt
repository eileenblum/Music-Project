[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

Skin of thorns
A breath of fire
No life comes near it
None feels it's desire

A longing for something
To ease the loneliness
In these deep enchanted woods
It feeds on emptiness

Who hears you, who sees you
Only those who you infect with fear
No equals, a darker part of light
Your only legacy was the pleasant shades of night

[Chorus]
And now it's been to long
Your cry of pain to someone
You are the melancholy beast of the woods
Never have you felt at home
In the silent dark of your throne
You are the melancholy beast of the woods

Who hears your cry
Who looks beneath
A twin born creature or a fellow soul

Behold your queen
One of your kind
Not of looks, but of what's kept inside

Who hears you, who sees you
Only those who you infect with fear
Across the ages you've waited patiently
Oh and now she's here, a light so clear

[Chorus]
And now it's been to long
Your cry of pain to someone
You are the melancholy beast of the woods
Never have you felt at home
In the silent dark of your throne
You are the melancholy beast of the woods

[Words spoken]
And the world held it's breath in enchantment
And the beauty and the beast within united
And the light and the dark were as one
And a new way of understanding was born

[Outro / Keyboard / Guitar solo]
