[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

Look into my eyes
They're the windows of my mind
A dreamspace filled with power
Growing stronger by the hour

A realm of thought and dreams with no end
A stairway to a galaxy - ya
A galaxy of images sounds and words
It's liquid metal flowing through my veins
Power of imagination has put a spell on me
Realities Chains won't set me free

A thought can move mountains
An idea can make the day
Fantasy is a firestorm
That guides me on my way

A realm of thoughts and dreams with no end
A stairway to a galaxy - ya

A galaxy of images sounds and words
It's liquid metal flowing through my veins
Power of imagination has put a spell on me
Realities Chains won't set me free
And at the end of the day
When there are no more words to say
A new story emerges in my mind

[Outro]

And at the end of the day
When there are no more words to say
A new story grows emerges in my mind... emerges in my mind....
Emerges in my mind....... ohhhh..............................
