[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

Endless ocean, oh mighty deep
A billion years old, and you never ever sleep
Nightmare creatures and playful friends
God's creations or natures circumstance

Look into the mirror of blue
And you'll see

[Chorus]
The Almighty Abyss
I often stare into
The Almighty Abyss
Always looking back at you... oh...
Stop to listen, and you will hear
The songs of centuries, they'll filling your ears
Shadows pass by just like a dream
Under the surface they're watching through the years

Look into the mirror of blue
And you'll see
The Almighty Abyss
I often stare into
The Almighty Abyss
Always looking back at you
The Almighty Abyss
I often stare into
The Almighty Abyss
Always looking back at you... ah

See
Hear
You will know
You will feel

[Keyboard &amp; guitar solo]

The Almighty Abyss
I often stare into
The Almighty Abyss
Always looking back at you
The Almighty Abyss
I often stare into
The Almighty Abyss
Always looking back at you... ah
