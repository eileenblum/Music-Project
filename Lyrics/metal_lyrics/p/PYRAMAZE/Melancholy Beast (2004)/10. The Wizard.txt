[Bonus track]

[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

Ancient tales and forgotten songs
Tell of former times
A magic world, where the dragons fly
Spreading out their flames

In this place good and evil still fighting
In between stood a powerful being

He was wearing a black cloak
And he was half human just
One word from his mouth
Could make mountains turn into dust

[Chorus]
Won't you honor him
With a thought or a smile
And will you tell his tales
To those you leave behind
Will you cry a tear
For a time long bygone
Then he will live on
'cause he was the wizard
He was the one

A tower so deep black, the night sky
Was nothing compared to that
And that's where he lived behind the walls
That could hold back time itself

He was a seer of past, present and future times
So filled with the wisdom that he could convince you with a rhyme

He was wearing a black cloak
And he was half human just
One word from his mouth
Could make mountains turn into dust

[Chorus]
Won't you honor him
With a thought or a smile
And will you tell his tales
To those you leave behind
Will you cry a tear
For a time long bygone
Then he will live on
'cause he was the wizard
He was the one
