[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

Welcome into my empty mind
To the ruins of old times
See what once was but is no more

Dreamspace of what should last upon
But the dreamers were failing
It was destroyed all to the core

I am the last, keeper of the past
Holder of the ancient knowledge
And I have been left back until time is no more
I am the last, keeper of the past
Holder of the ancient knowledge
And I have been left back until time is no more
I guard the ruins once fair as sunrise
Now this Kingdom is forsaken

My story is a sad one
I could not leave this place
The others are all long gone
I've existed in this realm
This forsaken kingdom
With beauty and love gone
Still I must call it my home
Secrets of unkind destiny
The echoes in these halls
The echoes in these halls
Still roam on and on
On and on

I hold the past within my heart
The reasons it went wrong
Find all your answers for yourself

I am spellbound to these halls
Protector of these walls
Though they're only empty shells

I am the last, keeper of the past
Holder of the ancient knowledge
And I have been left back until time is no more
I guard the ruins once fair as sunrise
Now this Kingdom is forsaken

My story is a sad one
I could not leave this place
The others are all long gone
I've existed in this realm
This forsaken kingdom
With beauty and love gone
Still I must call it my home
Secrets of unkind destiny
The echoes in these halls
The echoes in these halls
Still roam on and on
On and on

[Guitar solo]

Still I must call it my home
Secrets of unkind destiny
The echoes in these halls
The echoes in these halls
Still roam on and on
On and on

Welcome into my empty mind
To the ruins of old times
See what once was but is no more
