[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

Ice covers the land
Where it's never been before
Much living petrified at night
And gone is all light

One girl - One boy
A mistake that gives - the Dark Lord joy
Her beauty - her goodness
The Unicorns - came to her chest
Enchanted - they both are
Eyes are fixed on one another
Shadows creep up behind
Claim the magic horn of the Unicorn
The Unicorn - the Unicorn
The night has been reborn of the Unicorn
The Unicorn - the Unicorn
The legend has begun

The girl was weeping for sins
Her pain grows from deep within
Running away in agony
She could not bare to see

Someone waits - for her to move
The darkest lord - he wants her too
He must own - her special light
To sweeten his - darkest nights
This one boy - consumed by love
Must find his way - to the Dark Lords realm
Fighting through - to find his love
And claim the magic horn of the Unicorn
The Unicorn - the Unicorn
The night has been reborn of the Unicorn
The Unicorn - the Unicorn
The legend has begun
The legend has begun
The legend has begun

Through the darkness and despair's love carries him
Forward on swift wings through mazes in front of him
Guided by spirits that remain beside him
He must heal his world again
Save his princess from the shadows taken hold of her
The evil growing wants to rule the world with iron fists
Fighting for a kiss from her sweet lips he forges on
He brought back the light, settings things right
And so the legend says

Through the darkness and despair's love carries him
Forward on swift wings through mazes in front of him
Guided by spirits that remain beside him
He must heal the world again
Save his princess from the shadows taken hold of her
The evil growing wants to rule the world with iron fists
Fighting for a kiss from her sweet lips he forges on
He brought back the light, settings things right
And so the legend says
