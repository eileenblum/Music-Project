[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

Watch us now, years went by like days
I see your face, there's love and no regret
But the lines have changed you're not the girl I once met

We're older and stronger
I don't question this any longer
And although sometimes it's hard
We won't drift apart

Now I'm falling through mazes of memories
From the beginning until now, we got this far somehow
Now I'm falling through mazes of memories
From the beginning until now, we got this far somehow

Where do we go when we grow old
I do not know, but I've been told
It's easier if your not alone
You won't have to go through life
On you own

'Cause I'll stay, until we fade away
Time Passing by, somethings stay the same
I can still remember things I once said
I'll be there when you cry out my name

[Guitar solo]

'Cause I'll stay, until we fade away
Time Passing by, somethings stay the same
I can still remember things I once said
I'll be there when you cry out my name
