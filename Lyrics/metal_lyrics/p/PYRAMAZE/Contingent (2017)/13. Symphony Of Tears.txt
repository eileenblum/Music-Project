Empty hours 
Only ashes left
from the fire that used to burn within
Days are numbered
where I even feel alive
and free from the sin

So tell me where you are
Can you help me figure out this mess?
Disillusioned by the fact
I may never get that far

I find a face before I play
the inner struggles of the day
So no one sees and no one hears
the yearning symphony of tears
My acting is cold pretense
to keep me in the dark
I'm simple falling apart

I move in circles
Life is on repeat
and distractions keep me occupied
But always lurking
The voice of death seducing me
and I can't defy

So tell me where you are
Can you help me figure out this mess?
Disillusioned by the fact
I may never get that far

I find a face before I play
the inner struggles of the day
So no one sees and no one hears
the yearning symphony of tears
My acting is cold pretense
to keep me in the dark
I'm simple falling apart
Falling apart
Your dissapearance crushed
My future and my heart
