This heart lies awake
Memories replaying that I cannot change
Time won't stand still
Bleeding alone will you save me from fear?

Time they say is slipping away
but we can't fight the tides that won't change

Miles apart
This darkness covers up my heart
It takes me down
My drowning soul needs to be found

My hands they reach to you
Shattered by darkness a war so untrue
Time can heal this pain
Believe that we'll find our way back once again

Time they say is slipping away
but we can't fight the tides that won't change

Miles apart
This darkness covers up my heart
It takes me down
My drowning soul needs to be found
