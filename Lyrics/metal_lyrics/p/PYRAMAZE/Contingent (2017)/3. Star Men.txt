In the light of what's become
Daily incidents to some
We've decided time is nigh for action
Once the earth has lost its grip
We had to opt for full blown leadership

Prepare for take-off into the unknown
We're on our own

Headed for outer space
Saving the human race from dying
At least we keep trying 'til we're gone

And as we leave our galaxy
We will search for certainty
Other worlds resembling ours
Illuminating journey through the stars

Head on, star men
Survival we seek
Our greatest plan

Aiming at outer space 
Saving the human race from dying
At least we keep trying to become
Citizens of the stars
Earth will be but memoirs we treasure
If we get there in time

No time to waste
Resources are few
For our big debut

And the search went on and on
We feared we'd never see the sun
Faced with few alternatives
We turned around like resigned fugitives
But then a flash, a big bang, the divine
Disintegrated both space and time...
