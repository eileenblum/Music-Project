You've been under lock and key
In shady and suspicious company
Reduced to numbers
Since the day they turned our lives
Into a comprehensive list of whys

Desperately I live to clear your name
And I fear our world will never be the same

In the land of information we're
Searching high and low to find the key
The hidden evidence - our only remedy
The land of information will wipe out all of your grand mistakes
And bring back the man that once was spotless, 
That's all that it takes

Somewhere in the secret vaults
Lies a note predicting these assaults
Planned in details
To frame an innocent and shun publicity from what's been going on

There's a chance if I could break the code
to this encrypted and mendacious mother lode...

And the search goes on and on
I won't rest until we've won
