My world was turned inside out
When the truth dawned upon me
How could I have been so blind?
There were plenty of signs to see

Hey, what's my name?
Am I an illusion?

Held against my will
Raised to fight and kill
Under restraint
You brought me to my knees
Begging for the keys
to unlock the chains

Manipulation of man
is as ancient as thoughts and needs
But when did myself disband
and allow these horrendous deeds?

No, I'm not a machine
Flesh grew a conscience

Your affair is sick and surreal
It simply calls for treason
I was a fool for your ideals
Beyond all reason

I'm here to take command
Now I understand who I've become
Battles that I've fought
All that I've been taught
Will show till you're gone
