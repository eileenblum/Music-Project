My eyes swept across the hall,
a whole nation up against the wall.
This evolution hasn't changed a bit,
the straightjackets still a perfect fit.
Used in numbers to maintain the peace,
cruelty is taken in with ease.
When disagreeing voices start to cry,
they rot in sonic silence right until they die.

Words unspoken, 
of living in the rough.

Still we're here
The 20 second century
A medieval tyranny,
is watching and dictating all we survey
There is an army standing guard,
To take our hopes and dreams apart.
The key to survival is stand and obey

Art and literature controlled by fire,
originators shot by guns for hire
The thinking people is a deadly threat,
to a cold regime so obsoletely led

One day you'll decline,
and we'll be first in line,
to turn off this madness.

But still we're here...
