When the tyrant lost his head
No more tears were shed
You dreamed about a world of splendor
A lasting guarantee:
A plain democracy
To cast aside the old agenda

There's a need for great impact
In the wake of such an act
Approaching you in search of contact

Heir apparent coming through
Ticker tape parade debut
The madness is over
Heir apparent's here to speak
Redemption to the poor and weak
A rush of vigor

When power changes hands
The list of new demands
overshadows best intentions
Chaos takes its toll
when the people want control
Just another foul convention

But tonight it's getting done
Free thought for everyone
Look out for the new horizon

When you sacrifice yourself
for what you believe in
There's a chance you might succeed
