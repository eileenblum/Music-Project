Isolation
is a test of the human mind
Desperation
when there's none such for us to find

When you're caught up in desire
And you feel dependent
You're so afraid to lose it all again

Guess it won't end (Money buys it all)
Aren't you content? (Craving is your call)
You're so hellbent (But one day you'll fall)
On having a ball with the stars

Paranoia smolders
Crime and falseness will seek you out
Wealth is weight on your shoulders
Money talks, that's what life is all about

There's nothing more to want
And your dreams have vanished
Life has been good to you, enough is enough

You're living in confinement
from the world around you
Give up the gold, let go and you'll be free
