In a not so distant future I will
Reap the fruits of my excess
I always was extremely good at taking
Leaving nothing to redress

I want to have it all
I won't cease until I fall

Obsession
the race for growth has just begun
Depletion
there'll be nothing to gaze upon

Up for grabs a well-provided altar
A perverted mix of life and death
Feast your eyes on western exploitation
Drenched until that final breath

(Time marching on) It's much too late to save
(Some day all gone) No reason to behave

In a thousand years from now
The remains are discovered somehow
A fatal memory

Exhaustion
A classic case of rise and fall
Attention!
the race for growth will end it all
