Running on strong legs exploring like a child
Not from here but born into the wild
The malice from outside - has not reached this realm
But it's the calm before the storm

From here I see the fading light
And the begining of the night

[Chorus]
Tell me friends what lies beyond
The borders of this peacful place
Only ancient evil which you child
Are not ready to face
Elusive, deceiving
Don't trust what lies beyond
'Cause evil, is moving
It can not be undone

Growing fast I'm only one year old now
But stronger and smarter somehow
I'm learning so fast
How long will this last
Yesterday seems like a long gone past

I fell I have purpose in being here
But not to know is hard to bear

[Chorus - Child's Voice]
Oh, look at me now
I'm different somehow
The marks in my face
Are not from this place...
Not from this place...

[Chorus]
Tell me friends what lies beyond
The borders of this peacful place
Only ancient evil which you child
Are not ready to face
Elusive, deceiving
Don't trust what lies beyond
'Cause evil, is moving
It can not be undone
