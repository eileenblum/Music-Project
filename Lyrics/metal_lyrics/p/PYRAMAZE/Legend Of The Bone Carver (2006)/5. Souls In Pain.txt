[Words &amp; music by M. Kammeyer]

And so it begins, I'll search for my way
Do not say goodbye, I will return someday
I leave for my future covered by dim light
All that I bring are the words in my mind

I travel through valleys and over mountains
Fearing what lurks in the dark
And all that I see is sorrow and pain
And innocent slain

[Chorus]
Why, oh tell me why must all the good die
This is not right, I feel rage tonight
Hate against evil and all who serve it
Fear of the victims who don't deserve it
Their souls are in pain
Their bones remain
What can I do to fight it

I hate to see all the hurt
Of the ones left behind

I hear them coming slowly, marching feet of hordes
They're bred by chaos, nurtured by hate
It is their time now, and they are evil lords
Someone must stand tall before it's to late

The peace amongst old trees, where did it go
Out here it seems oh so cold
Shadows where no eyes see, I move through the leaves
No one can speak to me

[Chorus]
Why, oh tell me why must all the good die
This is not right, I feel rage tonight
Hate against evil and all who serve it
Fear of the victims who don't deserve it
Their souls are in pain
Their bones remain
What can I do to fight it

And I hate to see all the hurt
Of the ones left behind... behind... behind

[Chorus]
Why, oh tell me why must all the good die
This is not right, I feel rage tonight
Hate against evil and all who serve it
Fear of the victims who don't deserve it
Their souls are in pain
Their bones remain
What can I do to fight it

And I hate to see all the hurt
Of the ones left behind
