In the middle of this night-time, silence rules the earth
And the creatures of the forest will bare witness of a birth
A child concieved by wishes, and a touch of divine
No mother and no father but born of purest light

[Chorus]
Welcome into this world, it's no what is once was
Peace has left for suffering and it's closing in on us
We shall be your guardians, some of what still remains
Of what once was good in this world
And not bound by evil chains

A touch of human, with markings from beyond
Where will you go, where could you come from little one
Is your blood from this world, do you bleed like us at all
Your presence seems so mighty, and yet youre so small

[Chorus]
No hurt, no pain, no suffering
Has yet run through your veins
We will guard you
From the wicked evil chains
The ancient trees, will grant you peace
Your brothers are the spirits
Of the wood this will be your childhood
Welcome here - welcome here
Welcome here - welcome here
