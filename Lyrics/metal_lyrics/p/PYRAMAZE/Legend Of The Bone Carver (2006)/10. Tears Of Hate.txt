We leave to seek out the hosts of chaos
Wherever they may be
The dead walk again through the realms of this place
And they will fight with me

Fear our golden army
We come with great sounds of doom
But only for the iwcked
The shall bleed and new life will bloom

New life will bloom

[Chorus]
Raise your heads to the black sky of this night
Scream out loud and cry your tears of hate
Raise your heads to the black sky of this night
Seal your enemy's fate
Blood will be shed death caused by the dead
The price will be life in harmony
And the creatures of night will rule no more
The balance restored that's the way it has to be

Here on the fields that bleed my thoughts
Fly to the one
Who made a wish for all
I know she is safe and my promise I kept
I followed her sad call

Horror, and screams of pain
As we spill the black blood in their veins
They did nit show us mercy
And we will never hesitate
Will never hesitate

[Chorus]
Raise your heads to the black sky of this night
Scream out loud and cry your tears of hate
Raise your heads to the black sky of this night
Seal your enemy's fate
Blood will be shed death caused by the dead
The price will be life in harmony
And the creatures of night will rule no more
The balance restored that's the way it has to be

And in the end the peace was restored
But war left its scars on the souls and in the hearts
Of every living creature, many had been given a second
Chance, and they used it to create new life and to treasure
The life that was given to them, and the Bone Carver, some say
He went back to his home, wherever that was
Weeks became years, years became centuries
And he became nothing more than a legend

Legend of the Bone Carver
He was real, in a time of despair, he was there
Legend of the Bone Carver
