And so my journey goes on,
Will this be forever
I made a promise and keep it I will,
I will not forget her
The answers I seek from the old
Seem a lifetime away
Inside I shiver,
The cold and the dark will feast on me today

The day truns to night, and the night back to day
Now I feel that I've found the right way
I have reached gates, behing timeless black walls
Where immortals roam in the halls

[Chorus]
Question lie hiding in the dark
I have come for answers
Riddles fly and I know there's more
Something powerful slumbers inside
But I don't know what
For my true origin is unknown

We know what you are, you are the one
Who brings hope where there is none
The fountain of life lies within you
And within the words deep in your mind
When evil grows strong a creature is born
Who shall carry a light through the night
He shall bring back the souls of lost ones
They shall join him in one final fight

You must cut sacred words, into the bones of the fallen
By the touch of your blade they shall rise again
Evil shall tremble, as the blessed begin to march
'Cause they're craving justice deep in their hearts

[Chorus]
Question lie hiding in the dark
I have come for answers
Riddles fly and I know there's more
Something powerful slumbers inside

Questions lie hiding in the dark
I have come for answers
Riddles fly and I now know why
My powers are growing inside

And by the sound of these words
I now know who I am, I have carried
The answers deep within me
I have no more questions
I have a promise to keep
I am the bone carver
Let the war begin

Now I know
Something powerfil is inside
Please grant me this
Let my power grow
