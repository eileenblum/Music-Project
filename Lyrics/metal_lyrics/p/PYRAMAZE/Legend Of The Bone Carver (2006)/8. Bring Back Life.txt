Questions I had and answers were given
My journey back me swift, without fear
I carry a secret old as all ages
I must use what I bring back frim here

The souls that were slain,
Will walk the earth once more
A second chanse will be given,
And then nevermore

[Chorus]
By the touch of my blade
By the magic of my words
I will bring back the life
Taken from this world
By the touch of my blade
By the magic of my words
I will bring back the life
Takien from this world

The wind in the trees, like comforting words
I fell hope for the first time here
The moon lights my way
Through the shades of the night
I must brake down the will of my fear

In the land of the wicked
I walk on my own
But in the final fight
I shall not stand alone

[Chorus]
By the touch of my blade
By the magic of my words
I will bring back the life
Taken from this world
By the touch of my blade
By the magic of my words
I will bring back the life
Takien from this world

Your lives in fear, will soon be over
I have travelled through darkness to know my fate
All the agony shall be no more
And the air shall be cleansed of all the hate
I must bring to life what I carry inside

Someone has come, sent from beyond
With the north winds the world will spread
I am no God, but help you I will
Soon I shall bring back the living from the dead

Hear my words
Speak my name
Believe in me
And live again
