Strange manifestations in my mind
Words of a long lost and forgotten kind
Why I speak them, I don't know
Why I write them, time will show

The are buried deep within me
The are living can't you see

[Chorus]
I seek for answers can't you see
My rapid growing and the strange words within me
I long to write them I long to feel
I long to speak them, to make them real

We see your changes and we can not lie
We don't have the answers, we don't know why
No soul amongst these old trees can guide you
Leave on a journey, that's what you must do

Find the answers that you seek
Speak the words you long to speak

[Chorus]
I seek for answers can't you see
My rapid growing and the strange words within me
I long to write them I long to feel
I long to speak them, to make them real

You must leave the shadows of these trees
Travel along evil paths and leave safety
Seek the old who hold the keys
They guard writings with all prophecies
Travel fast, travel long
But beware 'cause evil's strong
They reign supreme, outside these woods
They'll kill by sight and devour light

[Chorus]
I seek for answers can't you see
My rapid growing and the strange words within me
I long to write them I long to feel
I long to speak them, to make them real
