Iâve been watching over you
Trying to find out why youâve been avoiding my calls
Somethingâs lurking, I must do
Whatever it takes to relieve you from pain
Up against the wall

When black turns to white
I can see you more clearly
Donât lose yourself in times like these
In the dead of the night
You can follow more nearly
The other side that no one sees

Under false identity
You took on assignments that go âgainst the person you are
Act of pure emergency
Has opened the door to a world cruel and bleak
A deadly repertoire

I believe in miracles
And thatâs what it takes to put your whole life in reverse
A race with several obstacles
Youâll end this affair and return to the light
For better or for worse

When black turns to white
I can see you more clearly
Donât lose yourself in times like these
In the dead of the night
You can follow more nearly
The other side that no one sees
