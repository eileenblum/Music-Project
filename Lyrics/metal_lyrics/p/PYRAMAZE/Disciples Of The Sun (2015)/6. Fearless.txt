I lost my way on the night of equation
A crowd of noise, a show of hands
They all ran wild, proclaiming âwe know who you areâ

Something deep inside me cried (âItâs overâ)
âWalk away before you fightâ
The riot kept on pushing through (âThereâs onlyâ¦â)
âTill there was only one thing left to do

Fearless
I just canât hold back whatâs on my mind
So fearless
My actions are regarded simply unrefined

I tracked âem down and stripped them of answers
Until they were just scared young boys
One by one they broke down, now thatâs who I am

Something deep inside me cried (âItâs overâ)
âLet them go and make their bedsâ
But the riot kept on pushing through (âThereâs onlyâ¦â)
âTill there was only one thing left to do

Fearless
I just canât hold back whatâs on my mind
So fearless
My actions are regarded simply unrefined

Something deep inside me cried (âItâs overâ)
âWalk away before you fightâ
The riot kept on pushing through (âThereâs onlyâ¦â)
âTill there was only one thing left to do

Fearless
I can never live with what Iâve done
Iâm fearless
But the fight against my conscience only just begun
Fearless
I just canât hold back whatâs on my mind
So fearless
My actions are regarded simply unrefined
