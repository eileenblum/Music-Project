I fathom your fear
As you walk the forbidden land
Exposed to your confiding mind
My deranged work of hand
Unnoticed through the windowpane
Cold blood running through my veins
You saw a damaged man
Guess you donât understand

There are shadows within me
No one knows about
Iâve been living a secret madness

So all this time
Youâve been fooled by my elusive crime
You thought you knew my name
But I held it within
To protect you from loss and shame
Now youâve opened door, exposure, begin

No reason to talk
Iâm at ease with what I do
But I know the world wonât hesitate
To decide that Iâm through
Taking what I feel is right
When the system fails to rectify
The deeds that others do
I do it for you

Iâve been hiding forever
This affair of mine
Iâve been dealing in abstract chaos

So all this time
Youâve been fooled by my elusive crime
You thought you knew my name
But I held it within
To protect you from loss and shame
Now youâve opened door, exposure, begin

Since I was very young
Iâve watched and yearned for justice
Now that Iâm grown and strong
No more reluctant apprentice

There are shadows within me
No one knows about
Iâve been living a secret madness

So all this time
Youâve been fooled by my elusive crime
You thought you knew my name
But I held it within
To protect you from loss and shame
Now youâve opened door, exposure, begin
