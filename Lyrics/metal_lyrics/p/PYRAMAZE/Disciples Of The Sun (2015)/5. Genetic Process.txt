Go raise your hand
If you want a piece of action
Feel the times of change
Castles to sand
We'll destroy with satisfaction
Keen to rearrange

Tear down!
The past's already dead
Build up
Our future world instead

Someone once said
I was merely a drop in the ocean
The ground is wet
'Cause I'm ready to show all the world that I'm back again
To clean up this mess
And relieve all the sinners from feeling responsible
Genetic process
That will lead to conclude that you're worn and disposable

We must rest
In case you wonder the reason
We know what's best for you
You're quite upset
Call it murder, call it treason
This is what we do

Tear down!
It's long time overdue
We'll build up
A much better world for you
