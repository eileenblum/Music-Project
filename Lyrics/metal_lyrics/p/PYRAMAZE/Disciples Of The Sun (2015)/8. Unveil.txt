I've had this alarming vision inside my head
Since you came questioning the words I said
Your fierce accusations sure took me by surprise
And the writing on the wall spelled sacrifice

Been ordered to come to my senses
Before this manhunt commences

The fear of your false intuition
Sends shivers down my spine
'Cause I have seen how you've dealt with
Solitary friends of mine
You've burned their skin
and disfigured faces, entrails
This torments persistent
'Til they finally unveil

Man always feared what he cannot understand or measure
So simple deviations might set off displeasure
The madness spreads like a wildfire across this land
New ways of living and thinking all disbanned

Convicted on charges so untrue
Praying for a last minute rescue

The fear of your false intuition
Sends shivers down my spine
'Cause I have seen how you've dealt with
Solitary friends of mine
You've burned their skin
and disfigured faces, entrails
This torments persistent
'Til they finally unveil

The act of your false intuition
Sends shivers down my spine
'Cause I have seen how you've dealt with
Solitary friends of mine
Our bodies rested on firewood
Barely awake
Relentlessly burning
Like witches at the stake
Like witches at the stake
