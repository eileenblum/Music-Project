Something roars in the distance
An ominous sound
Of chaos and people crying their lungs out
Heard from all around

The truth is hard to take
Too blind to discover

Disciples of the sun
Set out to catch the fire
A journey has begun
As flames break loose
Theyâre forced to reacquire
The reins of order

Every rule was abandoned
By our wants and needs
Now we fight for ourselves, regardless of others
A string of dirty deeds

The streets were paved with gold
Until our greed took over

Disciples of the sun
Set out to catch the fire
A journey has begun
As flames break loose
Theyâre forced to reacquire
The reins of order

Disciples of the sun
Set out to catch the fire
A journey has begun
As flames break loose
Theyâre forced to reacquire
The reins of order
Disciples of the sun
As flames break loose
Set out to catch the fire
It has begun...
