Caught in a photograph
The final breath before a winterâs coming
Lost in a photograph
The innocence of youth, a memory

No more fooling âround
Assuming that life is forever
And your dreams will come true in the end

Caught in a photograph
With no resemblance to my present living
Lost in a photograph

Thereâs nothing left as I fade away
