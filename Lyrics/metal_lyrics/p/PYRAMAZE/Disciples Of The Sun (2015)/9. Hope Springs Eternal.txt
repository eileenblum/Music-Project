I set out to sea
To find the whereabouts of you
Your disappearance puzzled me
So I began to investigate

Well, seven months ago
You were about to settle down for good
Guess time has come to show
That you doubted if you could

Where have you gone to?
Somebody needs you

I worshipped the man you were
I beg that youâre still alive
For better or worse, Iâm prepared
But hope springs eternal in this human breast

Iâm losing my mind
I canât rest before I know
Whatever reason you could find
To leave us bewildered and alone

Now seven seas been crossed
Been following every step you took
Your lifeâs been wrecked and tossed
in exploitationâs name

Iâll have my revenge
24 hours hence

I worshipped the man you were
I beg that youâre still alive
For better or worse, Iâm prepared
But hope springs eternal in this human breast
Forever disgraceful
The way they wrenched and exploited his skills
I pray that Iâll find you, my father
Right at the end of this kill

I worshipped the man you were
I beg that youâre still alive
For better or worse, Iâm prepared
But hope springs eternal in this human breast
I worshipped the man you were
Iâd hoped I could find you alive
In death weâll reunite? Iâm uncertain
But hope springs eternal in this human breast
