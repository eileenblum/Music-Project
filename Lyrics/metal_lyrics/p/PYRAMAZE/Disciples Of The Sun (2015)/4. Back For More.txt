You were picked up again
In the early morning
Broke and battered along the road
Only bruises remain
From a painful warning
Time to disengage and reload

Something lures after dark
Itâs so hard to resist it
Time and time again I witness

You wonât give up
Thereâs plenty of reasons to stop
Though itâs harder than before
You keep coming back for more
Beat up and broken, you stand
Like waves upon the shore
Youâre coming back for more
Thereâs nothing new to explore
Still youâre coming back for more

Some admit when theyâre wrong
And some learn their lesson
But you wonât even hear me out

âCause something lures after dark
Itâs so hard to resist it
Time and time again I witness

You wonât give up
Thereâs plenty of reasons to stop
Though itâs harder than before
You keep coming back for more
Beat up and broken, you stand
Like waves upon the shore
Youâre coming back for more
Thereâs nothing new to explore
Still youâre coming back for more

You wonât give up
You need the adrenalin rush
Though itâs harder than before
You keep coming back for more
Looking for ways to be crushed
Like waves upon the shore
Youâre coming back for more
