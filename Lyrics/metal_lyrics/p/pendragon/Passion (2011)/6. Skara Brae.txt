Die to be reborn, I must turn this thing around turn this thing around
Die to be reborn, I must turn this thing around, I must turn this thing, I can't find a way
This is the perfect life, the life that's born from imperfection, I will embrace disappointment
Die to be, I must find a way, I must turn this thing around, I must turn this thing
To mend the life that's torn
This is the perfect life, the life that's born from imperfection, I will embrace
Between two headland points lies the bay of Skaill, escape from the mainland, here could tell some tales
Where the wind whips up the waves white horses see the brave, the orcas come here every year
This is the cradle of man, and seen many tears
Where the wind whips up the waves white horses see the brave
It is clear this is so, will this strange grief ever let me go?
Where the wind whips up the waves white horses see the brave
