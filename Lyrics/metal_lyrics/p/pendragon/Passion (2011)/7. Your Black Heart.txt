Under blackberry streams and waterfalls
Hide away in the ruins of your cowardly past
Doomed to walk the earth in solitude for eternity
This pain of your own making
But you want somebody else to hurt
It's you who is to blame
And you who refused to see the pain you caused
And your ugliness, and the ugliness...
And beauty...

In your black heart you honour
Yourself like some kind of king
You talk of passion but no compassion
You've had so many chances
And now there are no more

I hated you with all my heart
But I knew the comforter would
Come and play his part
And I will have my vengeance

Run to the sea, build a house of shells and sand
Paint it pink live off the land
What is this melancholy of the sea?

I know it well it stays with me
This memory will always be a part of me

I tried so hard to protect him from you
But the law protected you
And now you are forever embedded in this song
And there's nothing that you can do

The time will come to honour yourself no more
I really couldn't say if god will give you a last chance
Through the backdoor
Like Maximus to Commodus I will be the one
To push the blade to your throat then my work is done
Why could you just not change?

Run to the sea, build a house of shells and sand
Paint it pink live off the land
What is this melancholy of the sea?

I know it well it stays with me
This memory will always be a part of me
