In the coloured corridors of circles and strange shapes
Existing just to juggle balls and dropping spinning plates
Passion burns up empathy and lets your ego rule
But somewhere deep inside a seed of doubt is pushing through
At night when all the worldâs asleep a voice inside me calls and Iâ¦

Drop my balls

I got a raging doubt that something here is wrong
Maybe I should say something stand out and be strong
And if you try to justify theyâll throw you in the cellar with the others
Common sense and heroes are so laughably absent

Passion? Give me some empathy
Passion? Give me some empathy

I cannot recollect a single word you said
When people drown in ponds and drains
A bag over the head

And if you try to justify theyâll throw you in the cellar with the others
Common sense and heroes just a quaint reminder

Passion? Give me some empathy
Passion? Give me some empathy

No no not here not now
No no not here not now

I said who do you think you are?
I said who do you think you are?

I watched your crawl across the floor
Towards this ancient temple door
A tragedy most canât resist
Your strange intoxication
