Can you firstly please let me introduce myself and apologise
I think this time I might have gone too far
Iâve been bending your ear for two thousand years
This is your revenge to the power of four

The blood in the water turns you on
I can see you shake

I want to see that ego taken down
Sometimes itâs not always about you
I want to see that ego taken down
Itâs not always what you say itâs what you do
I crave the truth
I crave the youth

We are in control now

Social vampires sons of Cain
The blood in the water turns you on

I want to see that ego taken down
Sometimes itâs not always about you
I want to see that ego taken down
Itâs not always what you say itâs what you do
I crave the truth
I crave the youth

Ritualistic hologram
Floating in the sky
You really bought into
This illusion

Lead me to your taker
Are you sons of Cain?
Lead me to your taker
And the blood suckers reign

Please let me make this
Perfectly clear
Iâve been lying for years
Please do let me apologise
The water is red the sharks
Are circling around
Itâs such a shame youâve
Gone so far off the rails

The water turns red
The water turns red
The water turns red

Iâm really not sure
This is what Jesus had in mind
