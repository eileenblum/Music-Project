Strike the fear
From your heart
You entered this life
Expecting love
Teach me help me learn
The names of all the birds
And reptiles
Teach me all
I trusted you
Still growing
You're a new soul
And it makes my skin crawl

At night
When I think of you
At night
When I self harm
I'm under your spell

Strike the fear
From your heart
The colour in my soul
Is something I must earn
