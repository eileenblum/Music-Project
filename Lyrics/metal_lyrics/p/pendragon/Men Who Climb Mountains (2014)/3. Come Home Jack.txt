She said come home Jack and cut the silver thread that binds you here
I really think I'll never be where I wanna be hey but that's just me
At least not in this world
It's animal instinct the bare bones
I have nothing left to give to get back home, to get back home
I've got no feelings in these hands - I've got no feelings in these arms

But I found out who I really am

Anomaly exorior memorium to get back home
Anomaly exorior memorium to get back home
All the chattering voices fell silent in my head
I was then in the moment staring at me
Chattering voices no more

Come home Jack and follow me back to the source of all
All your heartbeats and your shallow breaths have all been accounted for
A goodbye note to country and kin
Blows gently in the wind
I will never be far from you son
Just the other side of the hill

I've got no feelings in these hands - I've got no feelings in these arms

Anomaly exorior memorium to get back home
Anomaly exorior memorium to get back home

I live in the moment no future no past

Anomaly exorior memorium
Anomaly exorior memorium to get back home
Anomaly exorior memorium to get back home
I live for the moment no reason no rhyme
God only knows it'll be different next time
