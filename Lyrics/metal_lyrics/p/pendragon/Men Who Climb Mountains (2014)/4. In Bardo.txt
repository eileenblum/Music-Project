Lessons I learnt
Feelings I touched
Troubles I faced
Everything I embraced
All I screwed up
And all that luck
Now all my actions will mean something
And I can now surrender

Falling through a hole the size of a penny
Suddenly you're back here again
Screaming in your mother's arms
Maybe it'll be different next time
