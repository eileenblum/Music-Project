Listen to the silence howling in your head
A stark reminder you're alone
Feel the wind cut through your paper thin skin
Maybe it's the night that takes you all and takes you then
Unlocking my mind - time will tell - only time

Packed my bags and all we need
Try to keep calm - more haste less speed
To climb the jagged peaks
With colourful people - colourful freaks
Away from the crass and daily mundane
To flirt with danger and the criminally insane
There's a very good chance I may never come back
These are the new days - the unchartered track

It is what it is there's nothing you can do about it
Don't think the wind's your friend
Cos the wind won't know your name
Pushing on up forever why? God only knows

With our demented demons in this pit of kings
Where death is nothing and meaning is everything
Whatever he meant we all really know what he meant
For God's sake look after our people
Torn between there and here
I love you so much but I just can't breath

It is what it is there's nothing you can do about it
Don't think the wind's your friend
Cos the wind don't know your name
Pushing on up forever why? God only knows
