She painted the sky sunshine yellow
The moon ocean blue
Pushing through the ice and snow
My soul still growing and flowing
Cascading like a waterfall
That never ends
Maybe I'm fine
Every Sunday morning rise and shine she smiles
Forgetting who we really are
No future no past just us
Just here and now

Maybe I'm fine
Every Sunday morning rise and shine she smiles
Forgetting who we really are
No future no past
Just keep breathing out breathing in
