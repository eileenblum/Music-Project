Never believe there are no faces of light
Never believe there is no beyond here
Never believe that all hope is lost

Your life in tatters and your hands are cut
To brave these heights is all now that matters

Never believe there are no faces of light
Leading on pushing up
That narrow face
High as the sky in the night stars
Never far away
Never believe
Never believe they're far away

Never believe - never believe

There is always a price to pay
And you've nothing left to give
There is a beyond here
Never far away
All your trials mean something now
Faces of light wipe the sweat from your brow

You won't always have to roll your stone up that hill
You might turn a corner to something new
And all the voices in your head become still
All your trials and tribulations
Mean something now
They'll wipe the sweat from your brow
