Newspapers blow across the park
The last living dog somewhere in the distance
Gnawing on the corpse of the rotten planet earth
Driving your car through piles of twisted metal and dirt
How can you sit there and grin?
After all it was you who let the bastards in

No shame no remorse
You sold me down the river
To ingratiate yourself with the ones you wanna be with
Your shiny new best friends
It's not as if you didn't know
It's a means to an end

Too late to lock the door
Way too late to offer compassion to the poor
And still you look to save yourself
Don't keep saying what kind of God could let this happen?
We're perfectly capable of being destructive all by ourselves
No-one else needed
No-one else
It's the end
