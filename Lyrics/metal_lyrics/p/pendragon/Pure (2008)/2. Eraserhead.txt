Behind the iron curtain secret doors
Lie broken and twisted ideals that litter from my floor.
It's not that I don't hear you shouting in my head
It's just a noise that deadens me
Compounding my indifference.
I need you now like I need a hole in the head
I'd give you my sympathy
But the space behind these eyes is dead.
It's not that I don't hear you screaming in my face
It's just a noise that deadens me
Compounding my indifference.
Lay your head down, lay your beautiful head down
Can the worm turn inside me like a wheel
And shut the door of my sensitivity to the way you feel?
I hate your country, I hate this new religion
I hate your politics
I hate your like of kindness
I hate what you've become
And so it seems that green has become the new red
Void of human empathy
My head tilts in mock fascination.
As I pull the legs off this poor squirming creature
But I will grow and take my filth into an unsuspecting world.
You can't tell me what to do, the school's no longer in control.
The parents twitch like a wrimp wristed puppets
You and your liberal ideas- what fools-
Just a rebel without a clue.
