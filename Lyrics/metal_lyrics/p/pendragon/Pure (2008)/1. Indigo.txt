Never felt too good about my life
Looked like I'd end up on the scrapheap with the
Other dogs of the night
Insecure and dangerous
Never had the chances or the breaks that
The other kids had
So you drag your life through the dust

But in you, there was that glow
And a coat of Indigo
Problems will come and go
In my coat of Indigo

In the dark, I wear my coat of many colours
In some ways, it covers where I'm from
So you drag your life through the dust
Across the red and gold sunset skies
My wishes always lead me beyond
The confines of this life
So much to give
If I had the chance, I would've burnt this place down
Why did the spectre of no hope choose our town

But in you, there was that glow
And a coat of Indigo
Problems will come and go
In my coat of Indigo

I've been trapped for most of my life
In this airtight box
If I could get just one arm free
Then the world will notice me
If I could get just one arm free
I could swim to surface where I can breathe

Every day, the alarm bell rings
And I face another murder of a day
I look out my window
The sky is deathly grey
All the weakness and industry of the world
Groans as it starts another day

It's masters demand a pound of flesh
I cannot take it this way
So I look to the safety of my subconscious
Where I wash away all my fear
And dive into a deep blue lagoon
Swim away from here
