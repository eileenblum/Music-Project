Am I really losing you?
Is that Mr. Nobody there?
Is it still all for one, and one for all?
Standing in an empty castle
Or fading into thin air

When I was a boy I dreamt that God lived in tension
Memories like dusty toys
Never needing anyone
Am I really losing you, or has life just begun?

Standing on Earth's Court station
You can see the ones that have gone
The ones that gave up hope long ago
The ones that don't belong
Sad looking faces shuffling through their lives
Just waiting to find out what lies behind the big white door
But like a shooting star will you just pass us by?
And fade away into the night
And race across the sky one freezing night
