I come from a poor homespun family
Who left for America in 1918
But I feel undeterred because of the wealth that I have
In other ways in pursuit of excellence despite what they say

I worked on the land played music
And worked with my hands
When I closed my door I found I was no longer poor
And I followed my dreams to the ends of the earth
In pursuit of excellence and this great thing of worth
