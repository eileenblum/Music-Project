If I were to lead you
If I were to need you and we started again

You're not the only one who's always torn between two minds
Ravaged by the loneliness and ever present time on your hands

Mindblown and schizo is where we are
Climbing hills and popping the pills has it got this far?

Standing in a crowd voices shouting out aloud your name
You're not the only one who's stumbled a hard path
Now you look at me and laugh

If I were to leave you
If I should believe you would it all turn out fine
You living in your world
A gulf of difference between
And me alone with the madness living in mine

You're not the only one who's always torn between two minds
Ravaged by the loneliness and ever present time on your hands

Mindblown and schizo that's where we are
Climbing hills and popping the pills has it got this far?

Standing in a crowd voices shouting out aloud your name
You're not the only one who's stumbled a hard path
Now you look at me and laugh

You're not the only one who's always torn between two minds
Ravaged by the loneliness and ever present time on your hands

Mindblown and schizo that's where we are
Climbing hills and popping the pills has it got this far?

Standing in a crowd voices shouting out aloud your name
You're not the only one who's stumbled a hard path
Now you look at me and laugh
