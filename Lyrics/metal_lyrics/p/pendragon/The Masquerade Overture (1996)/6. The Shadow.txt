I'll come dancing through your door with hands out to the poor
And you won't know my name but you will play my game
And thought your eyes will sleep, sleep so very deep
It can't keep me from your door
Like a vampire I will call

And when the Sandman comes to you at last
I'll take the reins

Like a river flowing south
A virus coursing through your blood
Bursting its bank and over the land
Washing away the grains of sand
And after all the faded years
I look in the mirror on the edge of tears
It seems I might have finally seen
That haunting shadow was really me

There's a man who's followed me just about all of my life
Being to you what I couldn't be
I call him my insecurity
He was strong when I was weak
Spoke out loud when I couldn't speak
He takes you hand from your carriage
And kisses you under the silver moon
Taken by his charm hand on arm
This white knight of gestures can never do wrong

I ran and I ran to go as far as I can
Looking over my shoulders
But always seeing that man
Running after me on the horizon forever

He takes you hand from your carriage
And kisses you under the silver moon
Taken by his charm hand on arm
This white knight of gestures can never do wrong

Shining bright a silver light
On the long tall shadows of the night
Spiraling down and out of control
I know it's a dream but I can't let go

Cries for help fall on stony ground
There's so much noise I can't hear a sound
Forever falling and I can't sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

Looking for somewhere that's home to me now
The king of the castle and his sacred cow
I've travelled the world and by chance this is how
The lies became true
Between me and you
Free spirit I've travelled so follow me now [x3]

I'll come dancing through your door
With hands out to the poor
You won't suspect at all
Like a vampire I will call
