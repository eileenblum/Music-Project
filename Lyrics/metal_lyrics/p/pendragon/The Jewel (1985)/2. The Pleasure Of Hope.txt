Come out of the rain my weary friend
I know where youâve been
I know what youâve done
You suffered Behrings Rock
And now your welcomeâs just begun
Welcome home, welcome home

Her anchor weighs heavy round your neck
Your senses are alert
The pleasure of hope destroys the fact
That the dull pain ever hurt
She knows youâre coming
But sheâs waiting in the middle of the hottest desert
Goodbye hope, goodbye hope
