Colour blind, exposure to the Western World
Love is a sign, unkind, crazy thoughts of freedom stray in your mind
Fly high, fall far
Keep your fingers crossed, keep your ears to the floor
When the ferryman comes to take his fee
What you once owned is no longer yours
But love is free, but love is free

Playdown a little longer
Right time to make a break
These four walls getting stronger
The chain around my neck
Explosion of free will
Creative memory
A new infatuation
A whole new symphony
Fly high, fall far
Keep your fingers crossed, keep your ears to the floor
When the ferryman comes to take his fee
What you once owned is no longer yours
But love is free, but love is free

But love is free
But love is free
But love is free
But love is free
