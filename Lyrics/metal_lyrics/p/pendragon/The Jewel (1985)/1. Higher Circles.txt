When thereâs something where youâve gotta take your part
Youâve gotta feel it, gotta feel it from the start
Just to be in touch, the gift of luck
To be in higher circles will take you by the hand, a friend, a gift, a stand

I take if from the diamond proof
I shout it from the highest roof
My heartâs a Romeo
Feels the safest place to go

When your mega chance is sitting on the ground
You pick it up, you give it life, you give it sound
Just to keep the band in higher circles
The chance will take you hand in hand
Together we must stand

I take if from the diamond proof
I shout it from the highest roof
My heartâs a Romeo
Feels the safest place to go

Do you ever find youâre left behind?
Iâll fill the gap, I like the crack, itâs all mine
Will you lead my by the hand, a friend a gift, a stand
