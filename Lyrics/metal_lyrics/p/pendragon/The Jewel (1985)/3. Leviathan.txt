You killed my future, I looked on in pain
I hoped to see a poppy field at the end
My ears did burn, I recollect your thoughts
You didnât even try to replace your hate for love
Youâre a matt black box, a pair of unwashed socks
A braincell killer with my life on the rocks
I tried to stamp you out
Shut you out of my mind
All I could do was to keep in line
Never look behind, you never know what youâll find

As a child Iâd hide, as a child I never was told
I never was told, I never was told

I got lost in the deep green sea
No source is greater, my moonâs a crater
We got left by the forest edge
No source is great

At the end of the day, in the Autumn years of my like
I simply walk away and shuffle my feet
Iâm a stranger that Iâll never meet
My ears did burn, I recollect your thoughts
You didnât even try to replace your hate for love
Youâre a matt black box, a pair of unwashed socks
A braincell killer with my life on the rocks
I tried to stamp you out
