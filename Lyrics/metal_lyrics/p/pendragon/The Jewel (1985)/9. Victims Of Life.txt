They left the City at midnight
All gone without trace
The end of then bad times
They still remember the days
When they were search for

Among the woods and the trees
And all the other possible things
That made life seem so beautiful
They never really knew at all
Hang on to my life
Hang on to my soul
The meaning of life must mean more to me
That a thousand years below
Among the woods and the trees
And all the other possible things
Made life seem so beautiful

They left the city at midnight
Don't need to put up a fight
The sound they made was incredible
It was quite a sight
But they'll never forget

Among the woods and the trees
And all the other possible things
That made life seem so beautiful
They never really knew at all
Hang on to my life
Hang on to my soul
The meaning of life must mean more to me
That a thousand years below
Among the woods and the trees
And all the other possible things
Made life seem so beautiful
