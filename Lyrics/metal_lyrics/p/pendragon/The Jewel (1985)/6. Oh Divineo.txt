Lead me, lead me
Take me down, take me down
Cry, donât cry
Long standing hypocrites you burn the candle at both ends
Reality, reflection in my eye
Tranquillity a virtue in itself
Please give it to me
We need compassion
Of long standing nation
A book overdue, of lasting relation

Lead me, lead me
Cry, donât cry
Trace your deism and take it to the roots
Humpty Dumpty just fell down
Heâs crashing through the roof
Oh Divineo

Where does the fire burn now?
Where does the fire burn now?
Where does the fire burn
