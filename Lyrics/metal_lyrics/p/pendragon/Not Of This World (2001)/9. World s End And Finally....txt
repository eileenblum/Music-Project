Heading for hope - Heading for home
Heading for roads that don't lead me back here

Looking at you - Looking at me
Looking at days and nights with no fear
Looking for something not of this world

Here within the time we spent upon the mortal coil
Not knowing what it all meant our lives of pain and toil
Are those still standing tall beyond the china wall

And those who life now have endured
Are called unto the shore
And my soul will be free
I'll fly free now as a bird
Our voices to be heard

Their flesh and blood they were human beings
Their flesh and blood they were human beings

Here within the time we spent
Upon the mortal coil
Not knowing what it all meant
Our lives of pain and toil
Are those still standing tall
Beyond the china wall
And me and my soul will be free
The greed of man will be
So far away from me
I'll fly free now as a bird
Our voices to be heard

Their flesh and blood they were human beings
Their flesh and blood they were human beings
