We started our life so innocent but got lost somewhere on the way
Learnt little from the wars we've raged that keep coming back round again

As I look backwards my mind becomes hazy
And all that I find is the world has got crazier
Time after time as the blind lead the blind
The Hopelessly leads us in circles again

We came here free as children and we'll leave here just the same
With nothing to show for our best intentions
But a path of destruction and blame

And on up that hill we traveled with no cause to care for the others
So where are all the lost children?
They're you and me and you're still my brothers

As I look backwards my mind becomes hazy
And all that I find is the world has got crazier
Time after time as the blind lead the blind
The Hopelessly leads us in circles again

There is faith there is truth there is love but the greatest of these is love

There's are the shores on which we played so long ago
The crystal wave no longer falls

Men of steel who endured the most The Father The Son and The Holy Ghost
The butterflies of war flying so high sick as a pig on American pie

The seasons change the moon turns red
Don't surrender your courage to the voices in your head
You'd give all you have now to put right all the wrongs
So where are all the lost children? They're coming home to stay this time

These are the shores on which we once played
Were the flowers and the green trees just a dream we made?
Respect my friend was a lesson you never learned

So where are all the lost children? They're coming home to stay this time
