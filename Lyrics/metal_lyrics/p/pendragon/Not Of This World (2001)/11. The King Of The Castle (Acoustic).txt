Crossing the wastelands to carry me home
Holding the last breath of faith to the end
Rising from ashes my task is now done
I took the vows
My only bows

Looking for somewhere that's home to me now
The king of the castle and his sacred cow
I travelled the world and by chance this is how
The lies became true
Between me and you
Free spirit I've travelled, so follow me now

Held by the raging and powerful sea
Never threw up my hands to accept the defeat
Long nights of questions, no answers to hold
A heart of gold
My kindred soul

Looking for somewhere that's home to me now
The king of the castle and his sacred cow
I travelled the world and by chance this is how
The lies became true
Between me and you
Free spirit I've travelled, so follow me now
