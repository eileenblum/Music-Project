All the hatred in the world
Where did it all come from?
That man over there, he's the one to blame
He's the one who did you wrong

And if you should ever point the finger
Raise up the glass to humanity
And the footsteps of innocence so weary
Can rest now at the doorsteps of sanity

All the children in the world
With tears in their eyes
Where did they all come from?
Standing alone in a world which

They don't understand
And the black hearts all melt away
As the night turns to day
And we say we all want our freedom but

All we can do is hope and pray
'cause I don't know what we're going to do
'cause the boy who tried to change the world
Found out that world wasn't ready to change

And we say we've all got the answer but
No-one's ready to agree
'cause I don't know what we're going to do
'cause the boy who tried to change the world

Found out that the world wasn't ready to change
'cause I don't know what we're going to do
'cause the boy who tried to change the world
Will try again when the world is ready to change
