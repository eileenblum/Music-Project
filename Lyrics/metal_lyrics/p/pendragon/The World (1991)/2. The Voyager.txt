Long winding road where will you lead me?
As far west as man can go before he starts heading east
San Francisco, but where from there?
Out on the ocean where the dreamers go
Where the moonlight dolphins play
'cause I know where my spirit's free
I know where my destiny takes me
I know where my spirit's free
Into the heart of America
Into the arms of a new world
Into the heart of a new world dream, and free

And Thursday's child has got a long, long way to go
And Thursday's child has got a long, long way to go
And Thursday's child has got a long, long way to go

For those who seek shall be those who find
To push back the boundaries forever for mankind
The boy who made his mark in the world today
So spread your wings and fly away
Copper green Victorian looking out to sea
The first footsteps in India is where my ship takes me
I'm a wandering stranger just trying to find some answers for me
I know where my spirit's free
Into the heart of America
Into the arms of a new world
Into the heart of a new world dream... and free

I put my hand to my head and I look to the sea and think
Thursday's child has got a long long way to go
