On rainy nights in Xanadu
A new face new place
A new sound
The world today is a changing place

Keep your door locked up and hide your face
Drowning in a whirlpool of English pride
In dark old England where the wheels of industry only just turn

And at night the stars come out
Walking through a strange town
Deep in the heart of nowhere in the middle of somebody's somewhere

I'd fly home, but where is home?
I feel like an alien
Be brave again
England be my safe haven

And at night if darkness should knock upon your door
And the whole wide world wakes up screaming in the night
That old problem child of the world today
The Middle Eastern adolescent sulking its way

Into the safety of the Angel Isle
One day we'll wake if we wake up at all
And the world and his wife will come crashing through the door
