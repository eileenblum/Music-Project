And we'll go hunting deer up in the mountains where
The air is clear, far from the madding crown we left behind us
And you will see the unicorn no more

And we'll go hunting deer high in the mountains where
Man always kills what he fears
And all God's creatures will find safe sanctuary no more
And you will see man bring another race to its knees

And you can torture me, poison me and blind me no more
'cause I've gone to the other side
And you will see that the time will come
To take your brothers home again

And we'll go hunting deer up in the mountains where
The air is clear and when my eyes can see no more
When will you let us go?
And you will see in the moments of darkness who will stand by me

And you can torture me, poison me and trap me no more
'cause I've gone to the other side
And you will see that the time has come
To take our brothers home again
And you will see that the time has come
To take our brothers home again
