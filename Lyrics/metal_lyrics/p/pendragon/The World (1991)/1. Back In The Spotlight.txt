Was it you I saw standing naked at the
Doorway of some other world?
Was it you I saw who held the burning torch up
High screaming to be heard?

From the cradle to the grave you gave your
Heart and soul for broken dreams and promises
You can't remember who to blame and hid the
Shame we were the children of the revolution

I've searched the back roads of my life
Asking myself the questions
But now I'm back again
How have you been?

We've got to get on with the show
It's everything that we've ever known
'cause we got nowhere else to go
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me
Give me a little piece of your heart

Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me
Give me just a little piece of your life
From the cradle to the grave we gave our hearts
And souls for broken dreams and promises

You can't remember who to blame and hid the
Shame we were the children of the revolution
The mysteries of the human race

Our lives emotional junkyards
I now know what I was looking for
And we've got to get on with the show
It's everything that we've ever known

'cause we got nowhere else to go
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
The strain shows on your face
Find a place to call your home

Choose a reason not to roam
The patience of a saint is now
The courage of a lion and seize the day
