Girl meets boy, boy meets girl
A new love born, together they're gonna change the world
Another two seats on the merry go round
Safe in the arms of a magical mystery

Meeting in their dreams she runs fingers right through your hair
Burning my fingertips with passion
And then came doubt, then came the fears
And as they grow, oh it starts to show

Pain in their hearts and watching her go
This is what becomes of the broken-hearted
I always thought you were a Judas anyway
Slipping through his fingers like sand

He was twenty one, she was seventeen
A princess of magic in his eyes if you know what I mean
And laughter, and in the dancing flames of misty haze
He would die a thousand times to travel of the golden shrine

A Prometheus in her eyes
A warrior of romance forever
My Queen of Hearts
And will I search forever for my kindred spirit?

Two dancing ghosts that never can die
To search in my dreams by oceans and by rivers
Like two running streams that never can touch
And the pupils in your eyes are not as big as they used to be

Oh I never thought I could feel so alien to you so fast
Why did you ever have to go?
And all this would be true
If I'd never met you
Crystal blue
