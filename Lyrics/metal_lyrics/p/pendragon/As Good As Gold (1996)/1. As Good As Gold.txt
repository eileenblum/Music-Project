As the stars begin to fall away
Our breath as close as a summers' day
I open my eyes and look up to the skies and I dream

A moment of magic as we lay
As candles flicker and the shadows play
I open my eyes and look up to the skies and I dream
Dream that a new life will be born

Kicking and screaming into the world
Tolerance threshold low
Bowing to demands of a guilty conscience
And out of your control
Innocent eyes tell forgivable lies
In a spirit that's so pure
Marching into the madness of youth
And no hope of a cure

He's trying he's fighting all the laws of gravity
No signs of achievement no responsibility
In a world of his own

'cause the right of the world pushed him oh too far
But his Mother always said he was good as gold [x3]

Tricking and scheming into the world
Flying his flag so high
From the turret of a battle tank
Drowned out by his own war cry

He's trying he's fighting all the laws of gravity
No signs of achievement no responsibility
In a world of his own

'cause the right of the world pushed him oh too far
But his Mother always said he was good as gold [x4]
