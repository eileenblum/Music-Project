When she speaks to you in a soft voice
Makes you feel secure
Makes you feel good at things you do

When they speak to you in a loud voice
They just don't understand
And although you're there you're a million miles away

And I could be a million miles away
I'm a wandering stranger just trying to find some answers
And although you're there you're a million miles away

I could be a million miles away
I'm a wandering stranger just trying to find some answers
And although you're there you're a million miles away

When she speaks to you in a soft voice
Makes you feel secure
Makes you feel so good at things you do

When they speak to you in loud voices
They just don't understand
And although you're there you're a million miles away

And I could be a million miles away
I'm a wandering stranger just trying to find some answers
Please try to understand
