Will you ever understand what it is I do?
Is music in your soul or did it leave you long ago?
It's a long way but some day
I'll find you and give you
Dune you're in my soul but I won't let you win
Dune you can never move just slowly blow away
Oh and Dune don't you ever learn
To see things in another way?
I will conquer you but I sink in the sand to start again

Do those madrigals still haunt you?
Did they crumble fade and die?
Remember how they taught you and you never reasoned why
It's a long way but some day
I'll find you and give you

Dune you're in my soul but I won't let you win
Dune you can never move just slowly blow away
Oh and Dune don't you ever learn
To see things in another way?
I will conquer you but I sink in the sand to start again

Dune you're in my soul but I won't let you win
Dune you can never move just slowly blow away
Oh and Dune don't you ever learn
To see things in another way?
I will conquer you but
I sink in the sand to start again
