Sister bluebird with eyes so full of hope
Of what the world might hold if you could always hope
Some rays of sunshine throw some light upon your floor
And you sit and you watch in fear
But you can't wait too long here
For the shadows of the night to fade
And the moon reflects in your eyes

With these hands I'll help you never give up the fight
With these hands I'll make your soul dance through the night
With these hands I'll help your troubles disappear
With these hands I'll carry you far away from here

Sister bluebird with eyes so full of hope
Of what the world might hold if you could always cope
Some rays of sunshine throw some light upon your world
Some sense of danger lurks at the doorway of your mind
Of your mind

With these hands I'll help you never give up the fight
With these hands I'll make your soul dance through the night
With these hands I'll help your troubles disappear
With these hands I'll carry you far away from here

Sister sister bluebird
