Making waves
The tree that won't bend with the wind
Money saves
Can't make you friends in a day
Felt like a wind of change
Was coming my way
Building hope on shifting sand
We never went hand in hand
If it's time for a change
Beginning to wonder if
It's time for a change
Cutting the lifeline
Put so much trust in a sinking ship
I could've found time
But the boat went down
With all the best wine
But making waves
Can't make you friends in a day
Got a belladonna kiss for you
You really let your hair down
Building dreams on shifting sand
We never went hand in hand
If it's time for a change
Beginning to wonder if
It's time for a change
Oh let go
Got a belladonna kiss for you
You really let your hair down
Building hope on shifting sand
We never went hand in hand
