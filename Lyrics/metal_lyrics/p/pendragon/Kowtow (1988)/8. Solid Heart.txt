I see myself in you and you in me
A new colour from the dark
And we're gonna build a solid heart
Don't look away away
A new colour from the dark
Coming home 'cause it's late
There's gonna be a reunion day
So sing with me this song
And we're gonna build a solid heart
You see it shine
And the lights are bright in the city here tonight
A new colour from the dark
And I will search and I will find and walk out in the light
We're gonna build a solid solid heart
Sing this song and we're gonna build a solid heart
We're building hope, a stand, a law and we're gonna kick down the door
I will search and I will find and walk out in the light
We're gonna build a solid solid heart
We're gonna build a solid solid
In Rio De Janeiro. On a slow boat to China
On a mountain in Yukon, if you hear my voice just sing this song
Sing this song and we're gonna build a solid heart
We're building hope, a stand a law and we're gonna kick down the door
In the wild world one voice one song, one voice one song
In the wild world and we're gonna build a solid heart
