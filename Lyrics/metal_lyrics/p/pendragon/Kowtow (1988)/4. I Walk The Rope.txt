From this window I can see the rain outside
I don't mind though 'cos you're not here inside anymore
Pretending that it doesn't matter when I know that it really does
It's trailing me and enticing me like a hunter's trap
No no no no
I walk the rope I stalk my memory at night
Trace my steps back if only I had second sight
Maybe something I said I take it back I throw it against the wall
I stumble I fall
I walk the rope I stalk my memory at night
I walk the rope
From this window my mind is running wild
Feels like a toy stolen from a child
We were hearts disillusioned.
Dancing in the rain
Maybe we could walk in the past again
But when I think of that question
Was I the one to blame?
