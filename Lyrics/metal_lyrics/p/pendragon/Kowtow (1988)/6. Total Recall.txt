Do you remember Alice, it was one of mine
That song stole a million hearts. a million times
"Waving goodbyes from the harbour lights
Rainy Sunday afternoons. Enchanted Friday nights"
In my mind's eye of what went before
In old pubs they used to sing and talk about the war
I've seen desperation in the streets. side step the sinners
Do I see them as a movie or I see them all as mirrors?
I've been through colours, shed skins like a chameleon
Been on the edge of darkness
Which now feels so alien to me, so alien
'cause I see myself in you and you in me
I still remember in my mind's eye of what went before
In old dance halls where they sang and talked about the war
I've seen desperation in the streets. side step the sinners
Do I see them as a movie or I see them all as mirrors?
I've been through colours, shed skins like a chameleon
I've seen exit signs on rocky roads
Which now feel so alien to me, so alien
'cause I see myself in you and you in me
Sometimes I use my mind's eye 'cause it sees things I don't want
Through the safety of a window
'Alice' I'm coming home
'Alice' I'm coming home
