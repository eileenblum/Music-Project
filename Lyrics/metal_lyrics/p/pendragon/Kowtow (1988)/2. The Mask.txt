She wears the mask that hides the scars from a shattered dreamboat existence
I'm held in suspended animation
Waiting for her finger to release the pause on the video screen
I'm bleached clean now
I've had enough the dreams of love
The dancing moonlight on the water
Got a passion drive to keep alive
But I still want my circles with corners
Stand up stand up she always wears the mask that hides her face
Stand up stand up she always wears the mask of elegance and grace
She wears the mask that hides the scars from a shattered dreamboat existence I'm held in suspense and fascination
I'm writing all the words and the scenes
Another curtain call and King Lear tragedies
You said it was all perfume and wax crayon
The dreams of love
The dancing moonlight on the water
Got a passion drive to keep alive
But I still want my circles with corners
Stand up stand up she always wears the mask that hides her face
Stand up stand up she always wears the mask of elegance and grace
She always wears the mask that hides the scars from me
