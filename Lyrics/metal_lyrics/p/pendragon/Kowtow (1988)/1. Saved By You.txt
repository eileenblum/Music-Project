It was a rainy night in a fading light
Somewhere back in '82
Another packed out night down in Wardour Street
I might as well have been there just for you
Well I was fascinated then
And I'm fascinated now
You do this to me in a way you know how
And sure I can tell you I'm ready to surrender
I'm ready to be rescued
If you will be my mentor
I wanna be saved by you
I wanna be saved by you
I wanna be saved by you
Oh you know I do
I wanna be I wanna be

I'm going overboard
You pulled the safety cord
You're giving me the kiss of life
I'm treading water all around me
In this big sea of passion
Just like the black and white films you see
And sure I can tell you I'm ready to surrender
I'm ready to be rescued
If you will be my mentor
I wanna be saved by you
Oh you know I do
I wanna be saved by you
I do girl
I wanna be saved by you
Oh you know I do
I wanna be I wanna be yeah

And you give me some love
I wanna be saved by you
Oh you know I do

Well I was fascinated then
And I'm fascinated now
You do this to me in a way you know how
And sure I can tell you I'm ready to surrender
I'm ready to be rescued
No I'm serious
