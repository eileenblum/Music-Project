It's 2 AM and it's raining again
And I'm feeling tired in my heart
And I can't shift it out again
And I know about the way it feels
And I know just what it entails
And we take our positions on the firing line
It's nearly time
It's raining again and I feel like I'm playing a part
From the start and I feel like I'm taking apart
The way it's been going
When their money can talk and the rain won't stop
And your glory days have taken a beating
Stick around for your fortune and fame
Put your hours in the bank of no interest claim
In '49 when the gold rush came now it's 2001
Some things never change
Talk to me insecurity as it bleeds me
But got this fire that burns
Got a heart that just never learns
And the fortune and the fame
Looking back upon the days when the band couldn't play
Take it all
So wake up stay up you look wonderful
Wake up take up
Got a bitter little cocktail of our weaknesses and faults
And we trampled it in the mud till it was emotional pulp
It's 3 AM and it's raining again
And I'm feeling tired
Felt a little bit lucky, had a cease-fire for the night
My magazine was running dry
