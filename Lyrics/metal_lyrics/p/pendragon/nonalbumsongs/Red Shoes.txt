We like to scream and dance, take over the place
But she's a star spangled dazzler and she moves with grace
And she knows she's alright
But the kids just wanna fight on a Saturday night
We like to listen to the saxophone playing out his heart and soul
Tapping to the rhythm of the songs we know
Still living when the party's over
She sips champagne and you should see her bossa nova

You see her dancing in her red shoes, she's really living on a Saturday night
You see her dancing in her red shoes, she's really swinging on a Saturday night

Well the kids jump up and down, they boogie in the loft
We got a ton of explosive and we're gonna let it off
She's a real Scheherazade a new story every night
With her head held high she was picking for a fight
Oh never could get around to the business with the head
In her Cadillac and curlers you could kid her black is blue
But you ain't seen nothing till you've seen her in her red shoes

You see her dancing in her red shoes, she's really living on a Saturday night
You see her dancing in her red shoes, she's really swinging on a Saturday night
