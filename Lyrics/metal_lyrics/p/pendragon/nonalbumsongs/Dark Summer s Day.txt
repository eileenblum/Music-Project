[2002 "Acoustically Challenged" Live Album]Long summer's day stays on my mind
I know it's not a good idea to look behind me
Even though it's all through
Wish there was something I could do
It's not hard to say
But I still come back to you

[Chorus:]
Dark summer's day stays in my mind
It's the sort you can't forget
Oh it is that kind
Even though it all seems like history

[Chorus]

Got to try a little harder
Got to stay a little longer
Might come back to me
Or reoccur a little stronger
Even though I feel weary
Oh go back to bed
All of these stranger thoughts could be inside my head

[Chorus]
