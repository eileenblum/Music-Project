As the first snowflakes fall,
The toys in the window cast their spell.
On children's eyes,
Sparkle in the night.
Laying down to sleep,
Per chance to dream.
Nothing left but ashes,
Just a case, a date, a name.

So, plot a course Mr. Bligh,
For Sou' by Sou' West.
These deep shark infested seas,
Must do now what's for the best.

So, plot a course Mr. Bligh,
For Nor' by Nor' East.
We must hold fast now,
With tears in our eyes and the thought of our Heaven is on our cheeks.

A coat of arms, a unicorn chained.
The lion, the dragon it sleeps,
It's not slain.
Born to slavery is human fate.
I want to believe in something that's great.

I want to destroy these draconian laws,
And self rule the heavens,
Closing all doors.

So, plot a course Mr. Bligh,
For Sou' by Sou' West.
These deep shark infested seas,
Must do now what's for the best.

So, plot a course Mr. Bligh,
For Nor' by Nor' East.
We must hold fast now,
With tears in our eyes and the thought of our Heaven is on our cheeks.

Then one day we woke up and said, "Maybe we'll change".
Until then, throw a coin in the wishing well.

Then one day we woke up and said, "Maybe today we'll change".
Until then, throw a coin in the wishing well

I saw church,
I saw steeples,
I saw colours,
I saw people.
Harlequin and Columbine,
Disneyland to Frankenstein.
(From the people who brought you Einstein,
The people who brought you Tolstoy)
The people who brought you Lagerfelt and Klein,
Rockefeller, Monet, and Charles Manson doing time.
Rothschild, Pol Pot, and Chaplain if you must,
And the Vatican in all sincerity,
It's in your Gold we trust.
