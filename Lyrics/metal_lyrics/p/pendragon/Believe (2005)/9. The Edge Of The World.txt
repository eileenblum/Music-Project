Sometimes I feel like a twig floating down a stream
Don't know where it's going
Don't know what it means
And that stream always ends up at the sea
And it's strange, as this is where I wanna be
And I know I'll find those of my kind
To share these words and rhyme

Sometimes I feel like a fish in the sea
And I realise that we're all already here with me

And as I stand on the edge of the world
And I look into your eyes
I realise you're still there
I thought you'd gone, like the windblown leaves
Then I remember in Zabrze
Chile and in Poland our homeland
Dzien dobry, jak sie mamy
I was scared I wouldn't see you again
I just couldn't see how
But from an acorn grows an oak
I should know that by now

So I stand on the edge of the world
And I look into your eyes
And I realise
That this was never meant to end
And I can now call you my friends

Sometimes I feel like a twig in a stream
Don't know where it's going
Don't know what it means
And I know I'll find some peace of mind
And I will always be back some day
And as I travel the far points of the earth
I will keep you in my mind
Sometimes I feel like a twig in a stream
Heading out to sea
It's then I know I'll never be alone
It's then I know I'm home
