Do you believe in Darwin's theory of evolution
Do you believe in the President,
The Bible, The Constitution.
Do you believe in innocence,
Do you believe in thought control.
Do you believe in wonderland,
Or that there might just be no Al Quaeda at all.

This is no place for the innocent.
This is no place for the broken-hearted.
This is no place for the innocent.
This is no place for the weak, faint-hearted.
These are the days of the ambassadors of wonder.
These are the days of love.
These are the days of the architects of life,
So open up your eyes.

Do you believe in miracles,
In alien intervention.
The Koran, The Star of David.
Do you believe in the web the spinners spun.
Do you believe in the Blair war on terror.
Do you believe what you were taught at school.
Do you believe in the xenophanes.
It's a garble of intimations around the world.

This is no place for the innocent.
This is no place for the broken-hearted.
This is no place for the innocent.
This is no place for the weak, faint-hearted.
These are the days of the ambassadors of wonder.
These are the days of love.
These are the days of the architects of life,
So open up your eyes.

Society is so well intentioned.
A star is reborn in the East.
The secret societies of Babylon.
What now to believe.

The eyes of the world are upon you.
Watching each move that is made.
I journey to find the God of dreams.

The secret societies of Babylon.
A star is reborn in the east.
Hutchings and pyramids of men.

The meaning of which is forgotten,
Lies under a deep bed of sand.
Far from the view of human eyes.

Far from the view of human eyes...
