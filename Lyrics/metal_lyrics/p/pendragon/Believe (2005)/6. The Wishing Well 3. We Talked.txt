We talk music, we talk nothing
We talk girls, we talk nothing
In fact, all the things that made us who we are,
Candlelight and laughter,
Wine and much much more.

Some get love, some get rich, 
Some get famous seven year itch.
But if you ever know exactly who you are
So uncultured, human rights,
Are worth much more by far.

I saw coloured lights hanging from the trees
Celebrating who we are, this memory stayed with me.
But if you want to know exactly who you are,
Come to see the boys one night,
Our music's set us free.

Hello morning filled with so much rain.
Don't think I can ever drink that much again.
Where's your sense of humour,
The spirit of your youth.
Let's get our day and bag some weights,
Tonight we'll just be rude.

They say this is the path,
And final age of man,
The best is yet to come,
Before we kick the can.
Question everything,
Believe nothing.
We talk music,
We talk nothing.

They say this is the path,
And final age of man.
Human culture, Human rights,
We've all gone much too far.

So let's get out and hit some dirt,
Before we ford a boat.
Hello morning, Hello pain.
Don't think I could ever drink that much again.
Question everything,
Believe nothing.
We talk music,
We talk nothing.
