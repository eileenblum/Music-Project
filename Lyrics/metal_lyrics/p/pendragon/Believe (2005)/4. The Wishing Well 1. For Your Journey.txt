Destination unknown,
Steer this great ship through time and space.
Through cold and dark abyss
Are we falling into free-fall,
Set the controls and steer that great ship, Mankind.
Through the black holes, past the asteroids,
To safety...

As you take each others hand,
And you reach into each others heart.
Pray that moment never crumbles away,
And dies.
Becomes as the dusty books,
The broken wings of butterflies.
Don't lose that moment of thought,
That human touch.
So what if you're wrong?
Still means so much?
And when you feel broken,
And you look up to the stars.
When the humans could no longer love,
Remember who you are.
And as man's time slips away,
Through the all-boss of fate,
Remember you are as a molecule,
Some fool of heart,
Which will always make things great.

You might well be wrong.
Is it better to be happy , or be right?
Never let those eyes twinkle out.
Just always walk in the light.
And carry the crazy, the wild, the excitable, the child.
And when you fall to your knees,
And your eyes are full of tears.
It's time to make things new.
Listen to your heart.
I beg you, Please.
