Warriors of the search.
First draw of dark side, right down to a church.

I would fight for you.
I would die for you.
I would fill up the holes in the sky for you.
I would ride for you.
I would fly for you.
I would dive to the ocean floor for you.

It's about faith.
It's about time and space.
It's about everything in your life you must face.
It's about life.
It's about love.
It's about death.
It's about all you can feel,
And all that's unseen.

Little white dots on the TV screen.
Caterpillars to butterflies.
Your big ideas open up your eyes.
Your life tattooed upon your face.
A blueprint of some other place.

So, these visions on your journey.
These things need time and space.
The learning curve is slow, I know, but will click into place.
Do you know the secrets of the plain leaves?
Do you know the binding power of the lion?
Your life tattooed upon your face.
A blueprint of some other place.
Deepest scar but show no fear.
Your journeys end is near.
