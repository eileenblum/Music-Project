Two roads entwined and never ending,
Two souls, upon each other are depending.
And in my mind, my heart.
And in my heart new words.

Nude flesh, glowing in the halflights
New words, that only they can understand.
The mortal man may know,
You never let those feelings show.

This is the difference in the sun and the moon
So wrong, you don't know anything.
This is the difference in the positive and negative.
So right, but do you really want to fight.
Shear! Like a waterfall.

Two roads,
Long and never ending.
Two souls,
Upon each other are depending.
Two roads,
And down that long path they go.
And in my mind, my heart.
And in my heart, new words.
Her thoughts, floating like an iceberg.
It's such a lot to call unpractical mandate
Keep it safe for your journey home.

Two roads,
Long and never ending.
Two souls,
Upon each other are depending.
Two roads,
And I took the one that's travelled.
Two roads,
But you were always in the east and in the west

Two roads,
Shear like the raindrops on my tongue.
Maybe the twain someday shall meet.
