It would take the wisdom of Solomon,
To answer all your questions.
I could fake all that you want to hear,
But you cannot change my thoughts.
Throwing all common sense and reason to the leaves.
And you sit there like a 60's flower hippie prophet,
Spewing arrogance and junk.

And your reptile brain insists that black is white is black.
Spun like some icon Buddha.
Gone but you'll be back.
They hear no evil.
They speak no evil.
The three wise monkeys see no evil.
And now they're told.
Think no evil.

It would take the wisdom of Solomon,
To end this futile game.

Void of all responsibility,
Encouraged by some inner call.
You fought in God,
Your lawless society.
Now your voodoo heads must roll.

There's anger in your twisted thoughts,
And acid on your tongue.
Tapping away like a zombie robot,
Scared that you've been caught.
They hear no evil.
They speak no evil.
The three wise monkeys see no evil.
And now they're told.
Think no evil.

They hear no evil.
They speak no evil.
They see no evil.

Think no evil.
