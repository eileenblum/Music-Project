From horizon's end gods send winds cold
To leave this mortal world of hate, grief and pain
And be cursed forevermore!
Wind that blow will froze my bones
Eternaly in winter's silence
Sound of wind whiping the treas,
Whispers the names of the dead!

Northern winds will carres my soul,
Their claws will never let me go
Northern winds and their arms
Of frost are holding my forgotten hopes
They come from far, far away from north
Where coldness dwells in dark
Northern winds cruel and cold breath of the north

Northern winds carres my soul and heart in yours
Arms I flow forevermore on wings of yours so cold
My heart full of woe is waiting to sence your breath
Never stop, forever blow words of frost from north

Northern winds will carres my soul,
Their claws will never let me go
Northern winds and their arms
Of frost are holding my forgotten hopes
They come from far, far away from north
Where coldness dwells in dark
Northern winds cruel and cold breath of the north!
