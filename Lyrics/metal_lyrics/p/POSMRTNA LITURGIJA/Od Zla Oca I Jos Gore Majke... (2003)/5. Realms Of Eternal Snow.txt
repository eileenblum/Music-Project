Eternal snows call me!
Deepest, coldest your realms are
For years I have waited this moment
Glorious kingdom waits untouched

As I wait the time passes
A night slowly falls
In mountain's forest alone
Wind brings before my eyes
Pictures of life, memories
Long lost, pale and gone
Visions of eternal winter
Ice cold sunbath from above

Endless landscape shows
Immortal land so cold
Fields aslept in winter
Covered with clear snow.
