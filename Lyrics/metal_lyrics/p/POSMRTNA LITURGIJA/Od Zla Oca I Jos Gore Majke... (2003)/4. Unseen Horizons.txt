Unfullfiled dreams, unseen horizons
Unrevealed future that lies ahead beyond all
Frozen land grow so cold!
Snowless winters like worlds without fear
Unforested mountains on the northern side
As the body slowly leaves this world

Frozen years await for me, glorious thy gleam
Glorious thy gleam, await for me!

Unfullfiled dreams, unseen horizons
Unrevealed future that lies ahead beyond all
Frozen land still grow cold!
Unwalk paths, ways to glory
Flowless streams never find the seas
As the body slowly leaves this world

Past and future are by my side
With streanght and might I hear the voice of ice
And see the days that rest beyond.
