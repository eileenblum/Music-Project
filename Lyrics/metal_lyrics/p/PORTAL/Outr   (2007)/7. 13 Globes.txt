Utterly outside, parallel to all mundane dimensions,
Impinging on none, conterminous in all,
The hideous bubbling of thirteen.... frothing globes,
Amoeba beyond the nethermost angles
Lurker at the threshold

Yog sothoth, the noxious liquescent blasphemy
Who knowest the mazes of time, for all time is one unto him

The key &amp; the gate, opener of the way
Through those unspeakable of the void re-enter.

Soul symbol of the most abysmal evil.
