Coffin purporting grandfather clock
Adorning insane hieroglyphs
Extraneous hands gesture my entrance
Therein-impossible angles
Of transdimensional interior.

All truths of multiversal
Knowing revealed
Nothing unrealised.

I consume dimensions
Passing through unearthly
Stupendous neo vistars.

Occult splendour were revealed.

The foul express through angles
The pure through curves.
