Inconceivable evil
Seeped down from the stars
He is sunken

Drowned dead and deep
City of antiquity
Darkly curtained halls
Wealth of aeons behind them

Magical &amp; obscure
Preparation science; shall proceed
From the ocean depths

With the aeon olde
Stench of the sea
Astound a reeling universe
Man reduced to mere cattle
Before the earth is cleared off.
