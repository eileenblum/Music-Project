The watery mind of alien expansion
Neath yawning seas
In sinisterious exploration
Of multiversal conundrum
Puzzling constellations into unseen patterns
Forcing the stars right.

Envision all futuristic angles
Dreamworking to dimensions of super-strata
One psyche with the omnipresent awareness
Of a billion psyches, dividing, filling infinity
Becoming everywhere &amp; everywhen
Manifesting superabundance
All impossibilities to the contrary

The predawn magical science is mathematic
Unlock the gates of cosmos.
