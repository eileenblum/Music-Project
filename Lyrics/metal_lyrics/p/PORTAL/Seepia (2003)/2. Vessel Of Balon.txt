A brazon head engraved with sigils
Emblems, the essence of ancient planets
Sealed within

When the moon is olde
Shall evoke the servitors,
I bid you enter this vessel

Feast upon the essences
You so desire
Cast forth from the host
That serves your master

Behold your signs
Look upon this image
For it awaits you in silence
Unveil the secrets hidden

In the world of man
And in the realm of elemental spirits
