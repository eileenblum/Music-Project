Impious pitch
Peccant pipe
Phreqs propense
Tune incise

Helices metastasis
Phantom seers hexodeus
Nth umpteenth omentum steep
Honed tumescence biding keep

Savants divide
Unquestioned entwined
Unbound, unwound
Wind

Cast frenetic
Hands of time
Insurgents recess in the mind
Will of notion emblazoned on the swine

Err intern
Perplexing rite
Phantom cadence
Havoc smite
Eminence grise
Hexen spite
