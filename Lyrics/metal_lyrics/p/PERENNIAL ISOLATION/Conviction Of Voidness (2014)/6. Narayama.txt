It's time to forget
The pleasure of the past
The green blackness presence
The show of my death

Wherever the light never borns... my flesh remain
The torment prevails beyond... my suffering
The strench of rotting will be... my last sign
Only these cold mountains remember... my useless life

It's time to decay
Waiting to fall
