Woods claim...
Crave your despair
Majestic altar of fallen leaves
Implores your name

Only an open path
A band to return
The perfect darkness ihale
Your last desire

The wind comes from Aokigahara

Feel the breath of death
A grave for anyone
Corpses hanging from the trees
Beautiful your green mantle
Burying the light
That always shines
