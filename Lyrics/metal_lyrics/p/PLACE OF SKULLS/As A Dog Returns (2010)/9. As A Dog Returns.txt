Shadows fall, another daylight dies
I gave up the ghost and the chains that bind
Leave it behind, all that's misaligned
Press into the new and back to the truth

Many days of shame have wrought to defame
The Name that's above all other names
Lead me beyond to much greater things
Let this new hope be the song I sing

The tempter found one little crack
In my armor I thought I'd patched
Then took me places I shouldn't have gone
I found myself much too far from home

All the kingdom's pleasure for a season of time
But the glass ain't clear till you drink the wine
Now in stride I climb the steps from deceit
What the world offers brought me to my knees

As a dog returns to his vomit
So a fool repeats his folly
