Though He slay me, yet I will hope in Him
Though He slay me, yet I will hope in Him
Jesus, will you teach me to deny myself
Jesus, will you show me how to die to myself

My flesh is weak, my soul is frail
But in my weakness Your love never fails

Though He slay me, yet I will hope in Him
Though He slay me, yet I will hope in Him
This passing world, all in vain, still tugs at my heart
With all its desires and promises, it can never impart

Obedience over sacrifice
Is Your desire, not by my own device

May Your glory be a covering for all my iniquities
That leads me back into Your arms of righteousness
I fell behind, thought that I could do this on my own
Then all my trust fell to dust, and left me all alone
