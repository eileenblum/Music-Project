The passing days grow longer and longer
With overflowing thoughts of sorrows
As your love carves its way through my heart
So beckons the tears that fall in the dark

My world falls empty apart from your face
You're everything the heavens embrace
My body aches for your beauty again
My mind hates the days of my sin

Love is patient, love is kind
Does not boast, rejoices in right
Love bears all, believes all things
Hopes all things, and never ends

Into the sunrise where time heals wounds
Where it's never too late and never too soon
Through all of our tears of sadness and distress
Our dream still lives in a heart that's timeless
