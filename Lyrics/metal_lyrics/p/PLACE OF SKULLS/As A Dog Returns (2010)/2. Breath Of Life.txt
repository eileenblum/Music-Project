Tossed by the waves, am I sinking
Grasping for your life so completely
I let you down many times too often
Without you the tides of hope have broken

Will you pass my way again
And cleanse this broken heart, heart of sin
Make straight the crooked path I'd chosen
And calm the storm inside

Restore to me Lord the joy of your salvation
Please don't take your Holy Spirit away
These broken bones can't take another night
For you alone are the Breath of Life

Can't bear to think of your sacrifice
To hurt you more when I denied
Don't want to lose you again, no not ever
Turn these grains of sand to stone forever

Will you pass my way again
Mercy undeserved, light again my days
Apart from you, only hopelessness abound
Give me strength to live and be found
