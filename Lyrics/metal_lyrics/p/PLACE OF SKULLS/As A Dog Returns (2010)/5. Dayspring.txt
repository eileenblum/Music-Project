Can you take the pain
Can you take the shame
Won't you take a stand
And give up being a broken man

You play with sin, fall everytime
A broken heart and a seared mind
But there's one to lift and restore
And bring you back to His glory

Have you scratched the surface of light
Staying bound in darkness, doin' your time
Well God Almighty has a future and hope
These thoughts towards you He wants you to know

Trust in Him, not how you understand
In all your ways, He will direct your path
At this place there's peace you will find
Guard your heart for it flows the issues of life

Come to Me, so you can stand
Come to Me, be free at last
A Dayspring flows from my pierced hands
For one and all, the Son of Man
