Please don't say he smiled alot
Now they've layed me to rest
A wretched heart and a mind to match
Finally peace in my death.

However morbid it may sound
This world held nothing for me
By the grave and a twinkling eye
I have reached my destiny.

My life has passed in front of my eyes
A vapor in time, I lived and I died.
No more depression trying to disguise
Freed from the body that tortured my mind.

No one ever knew the inner tears that fell
Bottled up inside a living prison cell.
Though the Father of freedom saved my very soul
Years of corruption never let go.
