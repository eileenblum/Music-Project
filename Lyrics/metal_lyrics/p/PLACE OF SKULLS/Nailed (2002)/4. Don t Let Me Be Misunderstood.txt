Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Well don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad.

I'm just a soul whose intensions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side.

I'm just a soul whose intensions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem angry, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
That's one thing I never mean to do...because I love you.

Hey, don't you know I'm human
I have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
Some foolish thing, some little simple thing I've done

I'm just a soul whose intensions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Benjamin - Marcus - Caldwell / Originally recorded by The Animals - 1965]
