Last night I lay dreaming
Of days and nights gone by
My heart was drowning
Underneath a bridge of sighs.

Return to Me,
Return to Me my child
Return to Me
Return to Me my child

I wept within a vision
Followed with a will
Saw Him there, His cross to bear
And I am grieving still.

Conception of a disappointment
In an afterbirth of sin
Wasted years of denial
Too much pride and the fear of man.

[Lyrics by Victor and Anne Griffin-Music by V. Griffin - 2001]
