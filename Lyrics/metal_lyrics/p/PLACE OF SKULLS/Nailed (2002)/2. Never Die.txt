I spent my time dying hard
With no satisfaction in my heart
I pushed and I shoved until I cracked
Now He lives in me and I won't turn back.

Ride on, follow the Son
Never die, life's just begun
Don't hand me your deceiving lies
He is the Father and Son

Lay Your hands upon my chest
Make my heart beat hard like piston heads
I know where I'm going, He knows who I am
It's written in blood, truth never ends.
