There's a Spirit calling out
No mindless wonder in this world of doubt
A Reality more real than this
Deception will steal our minds of bliss.

No strength within myself
It was all spent when mankind fell
The sting of death entered in
We started to die when we began.

The father of lies, the tempter's crown
Unrighteous souls will keep us bound
But innocent blood shed from Thee
The stripes You wore were for me.

I long to understand
What the Creator has done for man
Can our feeble minds comprehend?
We started to die when we began.
