Rise up my love
my fair one, come away.
For lo, the winter's past
the rain is gone, it did not stay.

Open up, my love
Perfect one, my love

Until the day breaks
the shadows flee away.
Ravish my heart with the look of your eyes
how much better your love than wine.

Oh my love, so beautiful
Lovely, as Jerusalem
Turn your eyes away from me
For they have overcome, overcome me.

Open up to me my love
My dove, perfect one
For my head is covered with dew
My locks with drops of the night.
