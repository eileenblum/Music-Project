The universe hides the secrets of time
Reaching out for comfort among the lies
Division is sparked when decision splits our ways
Watching the course of human history fade away
How long till the silver chord breaks
And I will fly from thiw world and all its hate
Split the sky and let me inside
A man's eyes are sometimes blind to the truth
Regardless of creeds our worlds collide in two
Born and conceived from the vision of one seed
But dying in rejection, separation we bleed... we bleed
Imbalanced minds, chemically blind
Peace deferred, man concurs
Soon we'll break, we'll undertake
A time of choice, a chance to rejoice
Far... away from here.
