He makes his point on the tip of a very dull sword
His world is closed like his eyes to another man's word
Painfully clear that he buys right into the scam
Another sheep corralled and controlled by the man
On weakness he preys
Leads you astray
Conquered through time
Willfully blind
The symbol mocks the flocks that they will control
Flaunts the frocks, the fetish they secretly know
And when exposed they will buy out from under the tears
Because they know their key is the dagger of fear.
