Their fires are burning
Our ships come ashore
To discover what's already known
And our greed will cost them more
We take what's not our own
Once denied, blood flows
And let the monster grow
Their homes we took as our own
And fly our flag in their place
The riches of the land we acquired
Are rivers flowing with disgrace
White man, shameful woes
Our independence won
The monster took their soul
We wallow in desire
Like pigs in a mire
No rest for the wicked
Like sons of Bitches
Well I'm not too proud
To talk down
To what's done and said
By the monster we bred
Taken what's not our own
And deny blood had flown
Still the monster grows.
