Eyes meet eyes in a familiar way
The first step in your age of decay, first page... too late
Her grandeur of love takes you deep inside
In faith and trust you turn over and close a blind eye, in time
Day after day you've given your heart
Opened it up to this woman of dark, so dark... torn apart
Your love turns to hate but her siren still waits
Your hope and honor have become a disgrace, still you come... to her flame
She takes you away
And still day after day, she takes you away, and nothing changes.
