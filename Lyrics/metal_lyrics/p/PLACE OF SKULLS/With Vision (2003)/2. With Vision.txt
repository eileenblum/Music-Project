Lookin' down this highway through the hole in my mind
Turn Left, turn right, I can't decide
I'll set the course of these two wheels by the shadow of the lines
And make a place for my sanity somewhere in the sky
It's been too long, much too long since I've had some peace
Provided provisions, they're for me I believe
I take these bars in my two hands and search for mystery
And I'll be runnin' free when death finally finds me.
Reaching for the things that I can't find
Leaves a void in disguise
It's all in vain, no surprise
Temporal values are lost in time
Lookin' down this highway through the hole in my mind
Turn left, turn right, I can't decide
I take these bars in my two hands and search fro mystery
And I'll be runnin' free when death finally finds me.
