Awaken to this day, body's already starved
Continuation, the black is never far
My heart seeks the light, but thoughts are bask in dark
It starts with a tear, then rips into a scar

As I stand right here, my honesty has to speak
Your drugs of contentment couldn't hold me down in peace
I've got an urge to kill, and god I know it's wrong
Save me lord save me, don't need no prison yard as home

Save my soul before my last love is hate
Then I won't beg for patience and I'll become fail safe

I got a beautiful woman who stands strong at my side
And a mighty god in Father Yah, still my reasons just don't rhyme
A little pill supposed to kill and let my anger subside
But if I slit a wrist or connect my fist, would an innocent face survive

I'm getting much too close while looking to turn back
And I can see the end of my rope, how it's frayed and unwrapped
A blast from the past can't exonerate my goals
To a peaceful end in a six foot black hole
