Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord
He'll lift us up in due time
He's never late and He's never wrong
Able to save and destroyâ¦this is His song

Let no man say he's been tempted by God
There's no evil in Him to tempt anyone
But we're all tempted when we're drawn away
By our own desires we give way

And I pray for a changed heart
To walk with you Lord, and never depart
And I pray for a changed heart
You grant me the grace for a new start

And when that desire has been conceived
It gives birth to our sinful disease
So lay aside all our filth and woes
And accept the holy wordâ¦which saves our souls

Submit to God and the devil will flee
Change my heart so graciously
I humble myself in the sight of the Lord
Who's word is sharper than a double-edge sword

And I pray for a changed heart
To walk with you Lord, and never depart
And I pray for a changed heart
You grant me the grace for a new start
