There's a man in need
His past has found itself
There's a man who sees
What it's like for no one else

Brother from the gutter
The wheels came off your ride
Grace don't see no losers
Compassion I feel for your strife

Though I don't share your cage
Nor the grief of your life
I offer you this prayer
The peace that you will find inside

[Griffin]
