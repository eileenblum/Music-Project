I shaped my time the instant that I fled
And woman, I could never love you any less
But these many miles that I've roamed
Are weighing so heavy on my withered soul

I dream of the end when sleep comforts me
No sorrow or longing, nor burdens will I keep
I've ventured so long with these misguided hands
Burning my own trail to the Promised Land

If there's freedom out there
Then I believe no price to pay
In my darkest hour
Truth's light will shine the way
