We got whitey, a cracker agenda
We got redskins jailed on reservations
We got hymies excelling in business
Aryan nation to keep them in check

[Spoken:]
"Stop judging others, and you will not be judged.
For others will treat you as you treat them.
Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged.
And why worry about a speck in your brother's eye when you have a log in your own?"

We got niggaz, expect restitution
We got wetbacks stealing jobs
Politicians approve their own raises
We got pigs with badges to kill

[Spoken:]
Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged.
And why worry about a speck in your brother's eye when you have a log in your own?
First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your brother's eye.

We got Asians, a slant eyed invasion
We got dagos to organize crime
Bible beaters quoting revelation
Devil worship to endorse the fall

[Spoken:]
How can you think of saying,
'Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own?
Hypocrite!
First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your brother's eye.

We got rednecks, inbred white trash
We got faggots, matching genitalia
We got ragheads promoting terror
We got lies to cover the cost

Hypocrite!

[Griffin]
