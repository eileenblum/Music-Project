Dear lady remorse, picking my brain
Got no place to go is no place to be
But I got a gun and I got some bullets
Say a word and I'll put one right through ya

The red glow of scorn and proud disdain
Put together a plan, the ninth one today
That look in your eye is so far away
And the mirror don't lie, will today be the day

The words of the book I'm writing today
Are twisted lines of letters and snakes
With no conclusion of what's to come
Just a matter of time when this dam will break

[Griffin]
