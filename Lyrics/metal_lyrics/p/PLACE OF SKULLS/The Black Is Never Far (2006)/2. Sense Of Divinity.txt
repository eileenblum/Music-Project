Been searching for signs of things I can't find
This day and time are killing me
Offhand words, a media blur
Gets me disturbed and leaves me deceived

And I know we all have pain
Brothers and sisters humane

Upset the decree and we all disagree
I don't share in your theme, sets us apart
You ask me why follow the narrow line
A sense of divine enrages your heart

And I know we all have pain
Brothers and sisters refrain

We can hate, we can kill, slander our brother
Destroy ourselves like a sick motherâ¦

A blood red rose bed
One bullet and dead
If but one head
Had all of mankind

[Griffin]
