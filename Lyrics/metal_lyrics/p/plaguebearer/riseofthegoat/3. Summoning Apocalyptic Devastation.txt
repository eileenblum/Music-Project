Impurity dark deception they lay in wait Baring septic fangs
The sheep that stray torn apart fear and guilt Manipulation
Slithering incantations calling forth Old Ones
Ignorant faith misplaced sustains demonic victory
Gathering force of hate conjuring Armageddon
Summoning Apocalyptic Devastation

The god you worship facade has now crumbled
Horrific truths, unspeakable terror
The wolf in sheep's clothing has now been revealed
The one called Jehovah is really the Serpent
Man will fall reduced to ashes serpents rise age of blasphemy
Spewing forth churning Chaos excommunion the demise of Jesus
