[Paul Stanley / Andreas Carlsson]

We both had stories, loves, and lifetimes before
Left us wanting for more
But it kept us on that journey
With everyone we meet, we open the door
There were others for sure, but they never got to know me
It's all a way to a life worth living
So don't mistake what I'm givin'
When every day is done I only wanna run to you
Let me hear the words I'm sayin'
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through
You might not be the first
But for me your always second to none...
Sometimes the fears we have will get in the way
And the things that people say can make it so much harder
The chance for love can look you right in the eye
Yet it passes you by
So live a life with no happy ending
But I won't lose it all pretending
When every day is done I only wanna run to you
Let me hear the words I'm sayin'
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through
But for me your always second to none
Life has a way of making things brighter, lighter
Don't throw it away, it takes a way to see clearly
Believe me
It's all a way to a life worth living
So don't mistake what I'm givin'
When every day is done I only wanna run to you
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through
But for me your always second to none...
When every day is done I only wanna run to you
Let me hear the words I'm sayin'
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through
You might not be the first
But for me your always second to none...
Ooh-ooh
Second to none...
