[Paul Stanley / Andreas Carlsson]

Some people say love comes once in a lifetime
Some people say it's behind every door
I saw your eyes and I knew for the first time
No more playing my emotions
No more aiming at my heart
You make me bulletproof, that's what you do
I feel invincible when lying next to you
You've got the arrows bouncing off my skin
I lost a love before, this time I'm gonna win
You make me ooh-yeah (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah)
Ooh-yeah (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah)
Hidin' my heart was my only protection
Keepin' my distance to keep me alive
You took it all in another direction
No more firing at my feelings
No more shots to take me down
You make me bulletproof, that's what you do
I feel invincible when lying next to you
You've got the arrows bouncing off my skin
I lost a love before, this time I'm gonna win
You make me ooh-yeah (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah) yeah...
Ooh-yeah (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah)
No more playing my emotions
No more aiming at my heart
You make me bulletproof
Ooh, you make me oh-oh oh-oh, yeah
Aah, oh-oh oh-oh yeah
Oh-oh oh-oh yeah
Aah-ah, oh-oh oh-oh, yeah
You make me bulletproof that's what you do
I feel invincible when lying next to you
You've got the arrows bouncing off my skin
I lost a love before, this time I'm gonna win
You make me ooh-yeah (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah) yeah
Ooh-yeah (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah)
You make me bulletproof (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah)
Ooh-yeah (ooh-yeah)
