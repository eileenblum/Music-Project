[Paul Stanley]

I want you to know
That I'm thinkin' about you now
Time passes so slow
I remember goodbye and the tears in your eyes, but...
Who's to say why we stay with another?
Counting days 'til we're holding each other
I can hear your voice inside my head still ringing my ears
I can close my eyes and feel you beside me
Well I hope and pray to find a way to hold you somehow
I'm just lovin' you with out you now
I want you to know
That your face is all I can see
And now my feelings still grow
You and I can't deny what we're feeling
We'll get by on all these moments we're stealing
I can hear your voice inside my head still ringing my ears
I can close my eyes and feel you beside me
Well I hope and pray to find a way to hold you somehow
I'm just lovin' you with out you now
It's all that I can do
Lovin' you without you now
I'll find my way to you
Lovin' without you
Lovin' without you, yeah!
Oh, we get by on these moments together
Holding on 'til we find out forever
I want you to know
That I'm thinking about ya
I can hear your voice inside my head still ringing my ears
I can close my eyes and feel you beside me
Well I hope and pray to find a way to hold you somehow
I'm just lovin' you with out you now
I can hear your voice inside my head still ringing my ears
I can close my eyes and feel you beside me
Well I hope and pray to find a way to hold you somehow
I'm just lovin' you with out you now
And I'm gonna get to you somehow
