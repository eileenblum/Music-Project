[Paul Stanley / Desmond Child / Marti Frederiksen]

Falling like the rain
Crashing down again
Sinking all alone...
The walls are closing in
The pain is just beginning
I'm feeling like I've never known
I've never known...
I never wanted to ever hurt you
The trust is broken
Salvation
Lift me, lift me up
Forgive me with your touch
Lift me, higher
Straight to your love...
Shaken to the ground
Fear is wrapped around me
Fighting for my life...
Shattered by the truth
Scattered like the ashes
All that's left of you and I
I've realised
All you wanted
Was something real
And now I'm haunted
Lift me, lift me up
Forgive me with your touch
Lift me, higher
Straight to your love...
I hear the howling of the wind
It's crying out your name
I'd give my soul if we could start
All over...
All over again...
I never wanted to ever hurt you
My world is ending
Salvation
Lift me, lift me up
Forgive me with your touch
Lift me, higher
Straight to your love...
Heal me, save my life
Redeem me, make us one
Lift me, higher
Straight to your love...
