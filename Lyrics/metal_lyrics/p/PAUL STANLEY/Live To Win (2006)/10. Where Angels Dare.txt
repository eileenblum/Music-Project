[Paul Stanley / Desmond Child / John Lowery]

They say it's over
But I have just begun to fight
It may look hopeless
But that's the moment from what's right
Someday, someway, somewhere
I'm gonna take you there
Where angels dare to fly
Some people wait forever
Some people just run out of time
Some people live in darkness
And give up just before the light
You (you), me (me)
No we won't back down
Let all the others wait
I want someday, someway, right now
The sun is risin'
I see confusion everywhere
The world that's dyin'
There's revolution in the air
Someday, someway, somewhere
I'm gonna take you there
Where angels dare to fly
Some people cry a river
But never see the other side
Some people bow down broken
And end up swallowed by the tide
You (you), me (me)
No we won't back down
Let all the others wait
I want someday, someway, right now
Some people wait forever
Some people just run out of time
Some people live in darkness
And give up just before the light
Some people cry a river
But never see the other side
Some people bow down broken
And end up swallowed by the tide
You (you), me (me)
No we won't back down
Let all the others wait
I want someday, someway, right now
