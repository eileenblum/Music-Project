[Paul Stanley / Desmond Child / Andreas Carlsson]

It's all about you!
I can't take it
I've been workin' myself to the bone
Just to make it
To the moment that we're all alone
In my mind I pull your body closer
Every second feels like a day
In my mind I'm lyin' next to you
It's just a minute away, a minute away
I don't care where it ends tonight
That's right, it's all about you
Givin' it up until the morning light
That's life, it's all about you
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Can you feel it?
It's electric when our souls collide
Girl I need it
You're the drug that keeps me alive
In my world I'm nothing but a number
In your eyes I feel like a king
Lightning strikes get ready for the thunder
Just a minute away, a minute away
I don't care where it ends tonight
That's right, it's all about you
Givin' it up until the morning light
That's life, it's all about you
Here I am knockin' at your door
Let me come inside
Don't quit now baby we got more
Hold on, hold on
I don't care where it ends tonight
That's right, it's all about you
Givin' it up until the morning light
That's life, it's all about you
I don't care where it ends tonight
That's right, it's all about you
Givin' it up until the morning light
That's life, it's all about you
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
It's all about you
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
It's all about you
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
It's all about you
It's all about you
