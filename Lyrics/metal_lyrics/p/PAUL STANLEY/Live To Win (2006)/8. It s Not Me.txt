[Paul Stanley / Holly Knight / Charlie Midnight]

You tell me what you want
And you try to tell me what I need
But your smile can never sell me what I don't believe
Now the gun is in your hand
And all the words are on your tongue
They gave you everything when you were young
You threw it all away when you were done
You pray you found the chosen someone
It's not me
I don't wanna be
I'm not the cure, I'm not your savior
Now there's danger every second that you breathe
It's not me
I don't wanna be
Another truth cuts like a razor
You're gonna have to save yourself
You better look for someone else
You turn the world your way
And you lose the truth within your lies
But the feeling that you crave, money never buys
(Money never buys)
All the warnings come too late
And your body starts to scream
And if you think you see me in your dreams
It's not me
I don't wanna be
I'm not the cure, I'm not your savior
Now there's danger every second that you breathe
No, it's not me
I don't wanna be
Another truth cuts like a razor
You better look for someone else
When you run in a world full of touble
Trouble always runs to you anyway
Now the damage is done and you want me to stay
But it's not me
No, No, No
They gave you everything when you were young
You threw it all away when you were done
You pray you found the chosen someone
It's not me
I don't wanna be
I'm not the cure, I'm not your savior
It's not me
I don't wanna be
Another truth cuts like a razor
No, it's not me
I don't wanna be
I'm not the cure, I'm not your savior
You're gonna have to save yourself
You better look for someone else
'Cause it's not me
