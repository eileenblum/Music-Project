[Paul Stanley / Desmond Child / Andreas Carlsson]

In a bed in my room
All wrapped up in my own cocoon
In my head I see you
Like I'm stuck in a dï¿½jï¿½-vu
And it's always the same mind games
It's a dangerous situation, insane
It's a warp on my soul and I've lost all control
When I'm all alone and I dream of you
I wake up, I wake up screaming
9-1-1, no one hears my cries
I break up, I wake up screaming
Why must I grieve
For a lie that I still believe
It's a waste, what a sin
It's a fight I can never win
Anywhere that I go, you go
Baby, even in my own reflection, you show
Like a ghost by my side with a hold on my mind
When I'm all alone and I dream of you
I wake up, I wake up screaming
9-1-1, no one hears my cries
I break up, I wake up screaming
Ooh-ooooh...
On and on
I'm running in slow motion
'Till the dawn
When the morning saves me...
When I'm all alone and I dream of you
I wake up, I wake up screaming
9-1-1, no one hears my cries
I break up, I wake up screaming
All alone and I dream of you
I wake up, I wake up screaming
9-1-1, no one hears my cries
I break up, I wake up screaming
