[Paul Stanley / Pete Masitti]

Do you remember when you said I was the only one
We'll watch the years go passing by
I never dreamed that with a love I thought had just begun
I'd ever hear you say goodbye
When we meet and I start smiling
I'm just lying through my tears
Baby, every time I see you with your arms around another
Everytime my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Everytime I see you around
I go to places, but it's not the way it used to be
I only picture you and I
My friends all tell me I can push you from my memories
There's only so much I can try
When I touch your hand to greet you
I'm not sure that I'll let go
Baby, every time I see you with your arms around another
Everytime my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Everytime I see you
I found my way to a warm embrace
But I still think about ya
Why can't somebody else take your place
I can't stand it
Yeah, I found my way to a warm embrace
But I still think about ya
How can somebody else take your place
When the things that I do bring me closer to you
When I say (mmm-mmm-mmm)
I can't stand it - no (mmm-mmm-mmm)
Do you remember when you said I was the only one
Every time I see you with your arms around another
Everytime my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Everytime I see you around
Baby, every time I see you with your arms around another
Everytime my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Everytime I see you around
