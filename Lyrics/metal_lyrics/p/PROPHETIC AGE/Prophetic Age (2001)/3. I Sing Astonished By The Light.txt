Tears of blood
Latent instinct that paints the
flesh to the virile blow of the
wind that blows in the horizon
I nail you in cross
You're hands to bleed
A pagan sight
As darkest deed

When the doors close
Through the first songs
That astonish the lights
And illustrated the darkness

I know that life is poverty
decadence and pain
that fades as candles
In lonely praise
The day fades and brings the moon
Living in darkness
That seems to be mute
The blackest day of Humanity
The day's turth
covered by blood
