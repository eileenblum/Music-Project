Iâll pick the stars out of the sky
Iâll do it all for you
Iâll swim the ocean, climb a mountain high
Iâll do it all for you

Hey baby can you feel the heat
You set my soul on fire
Iâm gonna give you everything you need
The flames are getting higher

Oh Iâm burning, oh Iâm burning up for your love
Iâm gonna make you mine âtill the end of time
Iâm burning up for your love

Iâll make the sun shine on a rainy day
Iâll do it all for you
Take all my money and give it away
Iâll do it all for you

Hey baby can you feel the heat
You set my soul on fire
Iâm gonna give you everything you need
The flames are getting higher

Oh Iâm burning, yes Iâm burning up for your love
Iâm gonna make you mine âtill the end of time
Iâm burning up for your love

Higher and higher to the heavens above
Between the moon and the stars, I will show you my love
AhhhAhhhhhAhhh

Oh Iâm burning, yes Iâm burning up for your love
Iâm gonna make you mine âtill the end of time
Iâm burning up for your love

Oh Iâm burning, yes Iâm burning up for your love
Iâm gonna make you mine âtill the end of time
Iâm burning up for your love
