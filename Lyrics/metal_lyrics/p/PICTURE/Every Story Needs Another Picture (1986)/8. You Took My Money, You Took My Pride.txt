Take your time âcause I want it to last
I like to see you leaving
Iâve had enough now itâs all past
My angerâs only increasing

Aaaaah you too my money, you took my pride
Aaaaah I think youâre crazy, out of your mind

Itâs a crime to keep you around
You only gave me sorrows
So when you go, you can sleep with the dogs
Donât think Iâll miss you tomorrow

Aaaaah you too my money, you took my pride
Aaaaah I think youâre crazy, out of your mind

I used to love you all day and all of the night
How could I know your intention was to wreck my pride
I used to love you all day and all of the night
Itâs all over now you find yourself a place to hide

Baby baby baby baby baby
You better let me go
Oooooh yeahhhh

You took my things and I wonder why
I let you do it
Iâve had enough, you better leave me girl
Oh why did you blow it

Aaaaah you too my money, you took my pride
Aaaaah I think youâre crazy, out of your mind

Aaaaah you too my money, you took my pride
Aaaaah I think youâre crazy, out of your mind
