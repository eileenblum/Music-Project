Oh yeahhhh

Heâs half a boy and half a man
A machine gun in his hands
They told him to be a hero
Heâs a killer on command
But in the middle of the action
Heâs got to face the truth
Itâs me or him, thereâs no way out
Thereâs nothing he can do

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
Oh no oh no

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
Oh no oh no

Well she is just a woman
She only comes alive at night
Sheâs got to get some money
The dope keeps her alive
For a while she is in heaven
But she goes straight back to hell
When she gets cold turkey in a police cell

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
Oh no way

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
Oh no way, no way

Show me the way back, Baby

He is just an old man
Dreaminâ about the past
When heâs lookinâ back he realizes
That his life wonât ever last
Dreaming about the good and bad
About the things he could have done
But he will never get the chance to do it all over again

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
No

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
No way

Yeahhhhhâ¦.

Youâve got to know
Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
No

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
Ah no way back, no

Thereâs no
Thereâs no way back
Ah no way back, no no no
