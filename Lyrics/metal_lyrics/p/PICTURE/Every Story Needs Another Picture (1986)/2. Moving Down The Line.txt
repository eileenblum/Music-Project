No job to find, no place to stay
Why am I searching anyway
No future left no bills to pay
Itâs pain and sorrow every day

Aaahaaaa
Aaahaaaa
Aaahaaaa
Aaahaaaa

No girl to love, no friend to talk
I even got no shoes to walk
No clothes to wear no food to eat
A wealthy widow is what I need

Aaahaaaa
Aaahaaaa
Aaahaaaa
Aaahaaaa

Movinâ down the line, itâs so hard to survive when you got no dime
Movinâ down the line, itâs hard to relax when you ainât got time
Movinâ down the line, when you got nothing to lose and you feel the blues
Movinâ down the line, when nothing is working out fine

No soap to shave, no knife to cut
I must do something, but tell me what
No room to move, no car to drive
Yet I keep movinâ to stay alive

Movinâ down the line, itâs so hard to survive when you got no dime
Movinâ down the line, itâs hard to relax when you ainât got time
Movinâ down the line, when you got nothing to lose and you feel the blues
Movinâ down the line, when nothing is working out fine

Movinâ down the line
Movinâ down the line
Movinâ down the line
