Police cars on the scene of a crime
Curious people everywhere
Too late they couldnât get there on time
But dead bodies just donât care

Stand back for the people in charge
Do you know whatâs going on
Stand back for the people in charge
But the killer is already gone

The move the body away after takinâ the pictures
Looking for evidence big or small
Itâs daily routine in a big city jungle
Whoâll be the next to fall

A young cops first day has started
Just trying not to faint
The dead manâs face heâll always remember
But soon heâll be trained

Stand back for the people in charge
Hey do you have an alibi
Stand back for the people in charge
You better tell them no lies

The move the body away after takinâ the pictures

Stand back for the people in charge
Do you know whatâs going on
Stand back for the people in charge

Do you know whatâs going onâ¦â¦â¦..
