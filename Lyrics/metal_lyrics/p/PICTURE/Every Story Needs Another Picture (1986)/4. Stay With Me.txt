Odd and even are two things my love
Yes and no ainât all there is
Black and white will always be a pair
Saying farewell goes with a kiss

Be my night, be my day, stay with me
Though weâre different, we can live in harmony
Be my sun be my moon, stay with me
I just canât do without your energy
Ohoooooâ¦ Ohoooooyeah

Right or wrong is often hard to say
Whoâs to blame, I just donât know
Yeas, you and I we can change the world
So better think before you go

Ohhhh
Be my night, be my day, stay with me
Though weâre different, we can live in harmony
Be my sun, stay with me
I just canât do without your energy
Be stone oh oh oh oh

Here you and me, we stayâ¦ Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Ohh
Be my night, be my day, stay with me
I just canât do without your energy
Be my night, be my day
Stay with me
Be my sun be my moonâ¦
