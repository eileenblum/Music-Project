The plane is heavy, the runway short
I gotta make it
Increasing speed, better pull it up
Now easy does it
Those trees ahead, I still canât stop
Itâs now or never
I must go on if I succeed
Iâll live forever

Now Iâm above the ocean
I just canât fall asleep
It sure is cold but Iâm still flying

Iâll get to Paris, at least I hope
I really wonder
What I will find there, it has to be
A bit like London
Iâm getting lower I must take care
Donât feel like swimming
One night to go, I dream about
The Paris women

Iâm now above the ocean
Itâs hard to stay awake
Itâs very cold but Iâm still flying

Iâm still above the ocean
Itâs hard to stay awake
Itâs sure is cold but Iâm still flying
Flying, flying, flying, flyingâ¦
