Heâs a target for submarines
Driftinâ over the ocean
A royal sea show war machine
Steel without emotions

Pitchinâ, divinâ, rollinâ battle cruiser
Prayinâ upon a ship to let her sink

When the enemy is coming near,
Youâll hear the thunder rollinâ
Some heavy guns better cover your ears,
Imposing duty is calling

Pitchinâ, divinâ, rollinâ battle cruiser
Prayinâ upon a ship to let her sink

Just hear the peaceful thumping
Increase the speed and jumpinâ
The crew is ready for the action
And while the guns are firing
A thousand men are dying
The enemy goes down
The battle cruiser turns around

Attacking bombers on the radar screen
Thereâs no time for hiding
A direct hit in the engine room
Over and done with fighting

Pitchinâ, divinâ, rollinâ battle cruiser
Prayinâ upon a ship to let her sink
