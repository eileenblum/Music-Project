I met her in the âJungleâ
In some joint downtown LA
First minute that I saw her
I was hypnotized standing paralyzed

She was made for lovinâ
She was made for squeezinâ
A hot and never ending game
She was made for lovinâ
That chick has made me insane

So I took her down to my place
She made me hotter than the night
My soul was set on fire
Burning up until the morning light

She was made for lovinâ
She was made for squeezinâ
A hot and never ending game
She was made for lovinâ
That chick was driving me insane

When I woke up in the morning
Hammer beats in my brain
The girl was gone with all my money
I still wonder why, how could I ever say

She was made for lovinâ
She was made for squeezinâ
A hot and never ending game
She was made for lovinâ
That chick was driving me insane

She was made for lovinâ
She was made for lovinâ
Yeah, she was made for lovinâ
She was made for lovinâ
