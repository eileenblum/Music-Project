Drinking all day and I wonder, thunder in my brain,
Waiting till the tide will turn, coming back again.
You got no time for problems, money's all they see,
Waiting 'till the tide will turn, coming back to me.
Unemployed, feel annoyed.
Unemployed, to destroy,
Unemployed.

A dozen times I've been asking, I'm sick and tired,
Waiting till the tide will turn, they got me fired.
You got no time for pity, profits all they see,
Waiting 'till the tide will turn, it will always be.
Unemployed, feel annoyed.
Unemployed, feel destroyed,
Unemployed.

Unemployed, feel annoyed.
Unemployed, feel destroyed,
Unemployed.

Unemployed,
Unemployed, feel annoyed.
Unemployed, feel destroyed,
Unemployed..... yeah!
