In the night you see him running', when the moon is in the sky,
When you listen very closely, you can hear his victim cry.
Gotta' stay in tonight, 'till the moon is out of sight,
Nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger.

When the clock is striking twelve, Nighttiger comes creeping,
Don't think you have no worries, when your baby is sleeping.
Gotta' stay in tonight, 'till the moon is out of sight,
Nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger.

Nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger..

When the clock is striking twelve, Nighttiger comes creeping,
Don't think you have no worries, when your baby is sleeping.
Gotta' stay in tonight, 'till the moon is out of sight,
Nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger.
Nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger, nighttiger.

You'd better run, you'd better run, you'd better run, you'd better run.
