We're going to change the world, a revolution,
Every day heavy metal at school.
It be a world of, destruction,
We're gonna lock up the disco fool's.

We're gonna' give our people heavy metal ears,
Rock and roll will ever live on.
It will be the age of heavy metal years,
Kill clean music and we'll be strong.
Heavy metal ears
Heavy metal ears
Hanging on everyone I see,
Rock and roll is gonna' give them to me.

We're gonna' give our people heavy metal ears,
Rock and roll will ever live on.
It will be the age of heavy metal years,
Kill clean music and we'll be strong.
Heavy metal ears, heavy metal ears.
Hanging on everyone I see,
Rock and roll is gonna' give them to me.
Heavy metal ears, heavy metal ears, heavy metal ears, heavy metal ears.
