I know a town near a big golden lake, going there is a big mistake,
People there live only for funk, I tell you friend, you'd better be drunk.
But if you say, I'm going I'm leaving I'm going my way.
Think it over with a chance to come back, you've got to stay there.

Funky town, is the name of that place,
The music there belongs in space.
Try to go all night all there, I value friend, it's real not there,
But you say, I'm going I'm leaving, I'm going' my way
Think it over with a chance come back, you've got to stay there.
