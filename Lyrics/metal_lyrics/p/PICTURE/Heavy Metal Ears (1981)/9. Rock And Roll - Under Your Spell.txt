You are my everything, you can do anything,
When I met you, I knew I'd always have you.
You took my heart, you right from the start,
Cause you will always be rock and roll.

You are my everything, you can do anything,
When I met you, I knew, I'd always have you.
Never go away, I want you to stay, it will always seem, to live in a dream,
Cause you will always be, rock and roll.

Cause you will always be, rock and roll.

You got me under your spell, your magic I can tell,
Oh no, don't feel no pain, Oh no, don't feel no pain, do you wonder why?

You need me now, you need me now.

I'll put you under my feet, if I had to, I'd disappear,
Oh no, don't say goodbye, oh no, don't say goodbye, do you wonder why?
You need me now, you nee me now.

You bring me higher and higher, for you I walk true fire,
Oh no, don't say goodbye, oh no, don't say goodbye, do you wonder why.
You need me now, you need me now, you need me now, you need me now.
