I live my life, I'm a simple man,
I do my best, doing what I can.
Why don't you give me your identity,
All that's matters is quality.
I don't know, I don't know where you may be,
I don't know, I don't know 'cause I can't see.
I want romance, but you want speed,
I want your love, that's what I need
You wanna' live a life flying high,
You wanna' to make it I wonder why.
I don't know, I don't know where you may be,
I don't know, I don't know 'cause I can't see.

I live my life, I'm a simple man,

All that's matters is quality.
I don't know, I don't know where you may be,
I don't know, I don't know 'cause I can't see.
