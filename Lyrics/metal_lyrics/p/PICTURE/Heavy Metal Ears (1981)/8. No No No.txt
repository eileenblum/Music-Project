Oh my darling' where have you been, I am so lonely, come home again,
I miss your smile, I miss your thoughts, oh my darling', love you so much.
I'm scared that you'll say no, no no no no.
Oh my darling', is it the end, will you forgive me, and understand,
I made you cry, and that was wrong, without your love, I'm not too strong.
I'm scared that you'll say no, no no no no.

I'm scared that you'll say no, no no no no.
No, no.
