O boy, I'm feeling fine, I'm sitting here but I want to get out.
I want to drink a bit and I'm gonna' fight and fool around.
I wanna' have it, I think I'll do it now.

I'm looking for a girl and I would say to her, would you like to play with me?
We're going to drink a bit and if you want to, you can spend the night with me.
I want to have it, I think I'll do it now.

But after all my thoughts, I think, I'd better spend the night with you.
Ain't got no money, but after all, it's the best thing I can do.
I want to have it, I think I'll do it now.
