Flashes of memories, trying to find their way,
Feel I am nowhere, feel I begin to sway.
I'm out of time, I'm out of space, there's something wrong, I'll lose this race,
Out of time, out of time.

My watch has stopped, I try to see through this cloud,
Wherever I am, oh I'm gotta' get out.
I wanna' go back, I'm out of space, the world is black, can't find a trace,
Out of time, out of time.

I'm out of time, I'm out of space,
There's something wrong, I'll lose this race.
Out of time, out of time.
I wanna' go back, I'm out of space, the world is black, can't find a trace,
Out of time, out of time.
