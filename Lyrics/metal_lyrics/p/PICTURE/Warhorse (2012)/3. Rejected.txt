Slam your door lock your shutters 
Drown that place and trust the luck 
Trying not to show your raw emotion 
Never let your guard down selfdestruct.

No matter what they say 
You wont listen anyway

In the dragons liar I'll dry your tears 
Drowning in your fears 
Why you feelin so rejected

Heart to heart much to candid 
Staring at the darkness from your bed 
Mind to mind doesn't matter 
If you can't defend the life you led.

No matter what they say 
You wont listen anyway

In the dragons liar I'll dry your tears 
Drowning in your fears 
Why you feelin so rejected

You got blood ans bone, no mans clone 
Still nobodys home 
Why you feelin so rejected.

In the dragons liar I'll dry your tears 
Drowning in your fears 
Why you feelin so rejected

You got blood ans bone, no mans clone 
Still nobodys home 
Why you feelin so rejected.

In the dragons liar I'll dry your tears 
Drowning in your fears 
Why you feelin so rejected

You got blood ans bone, no mans clone 
Still nobodys home 
Why you feelin so rejected.
