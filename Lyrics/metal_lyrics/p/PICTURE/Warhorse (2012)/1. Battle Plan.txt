Legions of warriors 
Troops at my side 
Life of the conquerer 
Life of the pride

Death doesn't worry me
Send them to hell 
Look at the masses flee 
Funeral bells

We drive the force 
Battle plan 
Fight the wars 
Battle plan 
Change the laws 
Battle plan 
When I make my battle plan

Blood on the battlefields 
Send out the fleets 
Streets to be blocked and sealed 
Blood on the streets

We drive the force 
Battle plan 
Fight the wars 
Battle plan 
Change the laws 
Battle plan 
When I make my battle plan

Straight on my line
Trust my ways 
Its hollow shallow 
Praying to die a victorious way

We drive the force 
Battle plan 
Fight the wars 
Battle plan 
Change the laws 
Battle plan 
When I make my battle plan
Battle plan
Battle plan 
When
Battle plan
When I make my battle plan
