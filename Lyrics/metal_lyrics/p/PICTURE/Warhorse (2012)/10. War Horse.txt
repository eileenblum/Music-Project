All my wars are no more 
My soldiers denied 
Still I mount my white steed 
With honour and pride

But we were strong 
And I could see 
The trust shown in me

There is one that I trust
One never doubts 
Always carries me back 
And I am his mount

But we were strong 
And I could see 
The trust shown in me

Though exploited 
Never falted 
Never doubted the task 
Always ready 
Always steady 
Stand until I would ask

Through battles and blood 
We bite through the pain 
The smoke burns my eyes 
The bodies decay

But we were strong 
And I could see 
The trust shown in me

My warhorse 
Always at my side 
My warehorse 
Yes we stood with pride
Warhorse 

My warhorse 
Always at my side 
My warehorse 
Yes we stood with pride

My warhorse 
Always at my side 
My warehorse 
Yes we stood with pride
Warhorse 

Though exploited 
Never falted 
Never doubted the task 
Always ready 
Always steady 
Stand until I would ask
