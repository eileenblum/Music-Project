Life is a losing streak 
Smile but its looking bleak 
And I think I lost my way 
Calling up to that moon 
Eyes that are sapphire blue 
And I think I lost my way

It all turned out wrong 
I thought we were strong 
What can you do when the right way is wrong? 
Just illusions just illusions

World with a thousand stars 
Close but still too far 
And I think I lost my way 

Where is the strength in me? 
What is the right belief? 
And I think I lost my way

It all turned out wrong 
I thought we were strong 
What can you do when the right way is wrong? 
Just illusions just illusions

Before my eyes 
Change your disguise 
Laughing at people we need to dispise 
Just illusions just illusions

Colours blind my eyes 
Its there for me my prize

World with a thousand stars 
Close but still too far 

It all turned out wrong 
I thought we were strong 
What can you do when the right way is wrong? 
Just illusions just illusions

Before my eyes 
Change your disguise 
Laughing at people we need to dispise 
Just illusions just illusions

It all turned out wrong 
I thought we were strong 
What can you do when the right way is wrong?
Just illusions just illusions
Just illusions just illusions
Just illusions 
Just illusions just illusions
Just illusions just illusions
