Are there demons here 
Playing on our fears 
There is space in here 
With another life 
Looking in on us 
Try to feed our lust 
No more dust to dust 
Take me to the light 
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone

Time is relative 
Space is positive 
Need to save their race 
Feeding from our tribes 
We all need a life 
Need it to survive 
Still they breed in us 
Silence in their souls
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone

And I don't want an existance 
Living or not 
To block the view in the distance 
And I feel they are around me 
Tearing my skin 
And they've been trying to drown me 
Break down cause I wont drown

Those demons 
Swimming around in my mind 
Those demons 
Diggin in me all the time
Those demons 
Looking at me from above 
Those demons 
Better than drowning in love

And I don't want an existance 
Living or not 
To block the view in the distance 
And I feel they are around me 
Tearing my skin 
And they've been trying to drown me 
Break down cause I wont drown
Were not alone 
Were not alone 
Were not alone 
Were not alone

Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
Were not alone
