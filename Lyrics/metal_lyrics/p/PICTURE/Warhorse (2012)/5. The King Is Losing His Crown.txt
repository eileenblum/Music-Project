Why do people 
Take so long to act 
See the slaugther 
Blood runs down our backs

It never ends 
Time to take revenge

I will follow 
All you do is lead 
You can trust in me I love to bleed

It never dies 
Sorrow in their eyes

And the king is losing his crown 
And the king is losing his crown

Why does power need to choke our breath 
See their castles burning in the west

It never ends 
Time to take revenge

There is gold and walls are covered with the magic dust 
There are diamonds strewn as dirt but 
Dont go there were nowhere now

And the king is losing his crown 
And the king is losing his crown

And the king is losing his crown 
And the king is losing his crown
And the king is losing his crown 
And the king is losing his crown
