I want destruction 
I need my fill 
I want to prove to myself 
So go out and kill

I'm in a fever 
I'm in a slide 
I want to free myself 
From the way I died

Hell is an expression 
And of my soul and of my mind
Hell is an impression 
Look inside thats what you'll find

I feel no sadness 
This void of thought 
Its only badness 
In the trap in which I'm caught

Hell is an expression 
And of my soul and of my mind
Hell is an impression 
Look inside thats what you'll find

Sinners in the shadow of the damned 
Sinners in the shadow of the damned

I feel no sadness 
This void of thought 
Its only badness 
In the trap in which I'm caught

Hell is an expression 
And of my soul and of my mind
Hell is an impression 
Look inside thats what you'll find

Sinners in the shadow of the damned 
Sinners in the shadow of the damned
Sinners in the shadow of the damned 
Sinners in the shadow of the damned
