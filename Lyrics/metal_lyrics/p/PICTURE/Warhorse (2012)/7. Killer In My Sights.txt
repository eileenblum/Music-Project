On a cold and misty morning 
On a frozen winters day 
I was called up to discover 
How a body there could lay 
And I feel that 
The killers in my sights

All I see is all I take in 
Just a seed is all I need 
I will fing the killer hiding 
I will follow all his leads
And I feel that 
The killers in my sights

Oh how I tried 
Catch the one that I have been denied 
Oh how I cried 
Got to get that killer in my sights

Need to fing a clue to help me 
I've been chasing all these years 
Need to find a way to salvage 
Gotta try to block these fears 
And I feel that 
The killers in my sights

Oh how I tried 
Catch the one that I have been denied 
Oh how I cried 
Got to get that killer in my sights

Oh how I tried 
Catch the one that I have been denied 
Oh how I cried 
Got to get that killer in my
Got to get that killer in my
Got to get that killer in my sights
