There's a weight on my mind 
Answers hard to find 
Kicks me when I'm down but I get me up again

Hold on and wait 
Never tempting fate 
Dont think that you could change the way that I was made

I am strong I am fierce 
Fighting back the tears 
Never influence the way I've lived for years

I'm a rock in the sea 
Reflections follow me 
Never can be worn away
Forever free 

When I think I'm lost I'm found
And I stand my ground 
When I think I'm up, I'm down 
Yeah I'll stand my ground

When I think I'm lost I'm found
And I stand my ground 
When I think I'm up, I'm down 
Yeah I'll stand my ground

No I'll never back away 
No I'll never change my way 
And I'll never let my soul die
