Come on and feel that power 
Come on it tastes so sweet

Time to think about my reputation 
Time to try to get to higher ground

Thats the inferno's daughter 
I gotta treat her right

What I want is not my expectation
What I want is not what you concieve

Edge of hell 
Standing at the edge of hell 
Edge of hell 
And I should have known damned well

Come on I need it hotter 
Come on I burn it bright 
Time to try another combination 
Time to try and get us burning right

Edge of hell 
Standing at the edge of hell 
Edge of hell 
And I should have known damned well

Edge of hell 
Standing at the edge of hell 
Edge of hell 
And I should have known damned well

Edge of hell 
Standing at the edge of hell 
Edge of hell 
And I should have known damned well

Edge of hell 
Edge of hell 
And I should have known damned well

Edge of hell
