I couldn't tell if I was on my back 
You never told me I would be attacked 
You wrapped me around your little finger 
And I should hang my head in shame

What it feels like livin in a cage 
And I could never ever be upstaged 
There goes my heart my reputation 
And I should hang my head in shame

When you said you needed someone babe 
I could change my ways thats the price I pay 
When I said I need a place to lay 
You stood in my way 
Thats the price I pay

You gotta show you feel something sometimes 
But I could never see it in your eyes 
Cant stand that mental suffocation 
And I should hang my head in shame

When you said you needed someone babe 
I could change my ways thats the price I pay 
When I said I need a place to lay 
You stood in my way 
Thats the price I pay

I couldn't tell if I was on my back 
You never told me I would be attacked 
You wrapped me around your little finger 
And I should hang my head in shame

When you said you needed someone babe 
I could change my ways thats the price I pay 
When I said I need a place to lay 
You stood in my way 
Thats the price I pay

When you said you needed someone babe 
I could change my ways thats the price I pay 
When I said I need a place to lay 
You stood in my way 
Thats the price I pay
