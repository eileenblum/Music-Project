Trees are silent sky is grey
Thunder storm is coming this way
Lady lightning somewhere up there
Thundering laugh she don't care

Thunder is cracking the sky
Lightning is striking
I don't wanna die

Rain is hammering on my window
Even in here you feel the wind blow
All those clouds very frightening
I can see lady lightning

Thunder leads her magical sound
When her lightning strikes the ground
Oh she's got a mind of a snake
Making you shiver and shake
