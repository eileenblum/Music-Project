You pay the price for cheap thrills
All night you gotta run
The price is high the speed kills
You wanna have some fun

Baby we'll never
Try to slow it down
Baby you better
Spread the word around
I'm a night hunter

Dark moody night no neon
I've lost my mind my sense
Sun's coming up I'm tired
No where to go no friends
