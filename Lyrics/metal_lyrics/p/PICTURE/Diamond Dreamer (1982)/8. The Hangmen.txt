Bad reputation
I'm in a mood for a fight
No celebrations
No playing games tonight

I'm the hangman
Beat me if you can

I feel no pity
Gonna hit you right in the face
I search the city
You can't hide in no place

I have a lot of problems
At least that's what they say
My way of living
I only live for today
