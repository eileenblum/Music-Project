Your way of living
Taking no giving
Makes me wild
Tell me what to do
Sneaky eyes that watch me
Silver tongue that wants me
Makes me mean
Meaner than you

To live for yourself ain't no future
To live for yourself lousy lady

No more games stop playing
Ain't no use for crying
Now you know
What it's all about
You're the one who wants me
You're the one who needs me
Therefore girl
Show your love to me
