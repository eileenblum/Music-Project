I'm in love
Gonna make you see
Everything you say
Is touching me
I only know you for awhile
Want you to know
I love your smile

Never felt this way before
Seen your face and I want more
Never had this touch before
I'm gonna see you to your door

You play your part
And I play mine
Your lips are like
A taste of wine
I love your body
I love your face
A blessing to the
Human race
