Your face is magic
Your words are so cold
You felt so lonely
I tried to let go
What will it be whose gonna win
Can't you see the trouble were in

Hot lovin' next to the stage
Hot lovin' oh yeah we can make

You're dressed so lovely
Your hair is a mess
You see the stars
Some bigger some less
You think it's magic
The lights and the sounds
It is real you know what we found

You try to keep me going
I couldn't stop the growing
You know it's hard to handle
You don't know where to run to
