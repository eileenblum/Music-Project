No one to hide
No one to guide me now
No one to chase
Nothing to race or fight
No one to tell
How the rules are set
No one to win
In my last bet

I had a message from hell

Whose gonna tease
Whose gonna squeeze me tonight
I'm gonna win
The devil's on my side
Don't mess with me
I'm breaking the law
Don't say I'm cheating
I might use my claw
