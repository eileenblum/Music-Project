Day and night all alone
I'm sure I'm gonna make it on my own
I know it's real I've got a dream
No matter how hard or far it may seem

Diamond dreamer you're not a loser
Diamond dreamer you're gonna win

Set the day you'll be the champion
Find out things that have to be done
Throw your minor tears away
Happiness will take you to that day

Don't be afraid to be a dreamer
Can you feel the action in the air
You got to fight and never stop
All the way you need to reach the top
