Movin' through a space in my mind, gotta' pass into the zone
Livin' with a dream, a dream I can find, got to make it on my own
Please tell me why, I'm flyin' in time

It's seeming dreams are real to me, that's because now I am there
Follow me and then, then you will see, follow me if you dare
Please tell me why, I'm flyin' in time

Movin' through a space in my mind, gotta' pass into the zone
Livin' with a dream, a dream I can find, got to make it on my own
Please tell me why, I'm flyin' in time
Please tell me why, I'm flyin' in time
Please tell me why, I'm flyin' in time
Please tell me why, I'm flyin' in time
