I tried makin' life, support me alone, I tried and I tried it again
But no man survives in a dream of hope, a dream of a world without sin
No one can take it away from me, I'm passing over the borderline

Father forgive me for what I have done, but don't disown one who survives
Mother forgive me for I am your son, one who stays alive
Once lost never recovered, no rescue party can rescue me

Living a life of crime, livin' in my time
Into the underworld, yeah, into the underworld

Strangers are standing, hands on their guns, highwaymen of today
Always livin' a life on the run, beggar man thief they say
No one can take it away from me, I'm passing over the borderline

Living a life of crime, livin' in my time
Into the underworld, yeah, into the underworld

Once bitten, two times shy, layin' it on the line
Break the habit I try and I try, now we're two of a kind
Once lost never recovered, no rescue party can rescue me

Living a life of crime, livin' in my time
Into the underworld, yeah, into the underworld

Living a life of crime, livin' in my time
Down and out
Into the underworld
 Into the underworld
Into the underworld
Yeah
Yeah
Into the underworld
