Livin' in a shadow
Live a life of sin
Now you're having pleasure
There ain't no givin' in
Do you ever wonder
Do you ever think
What may lie beyond you
What's the missing link

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your heart will see... eternal dark

There ain't no use behavin'
Things can never change
There ain't no book to guide you
You're destined to the rein
Why do you listen to the holy man
Satan will take you, the only one who can

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your heart will see... eternal dark

Eternal dark

Livin' in a shadow
Live a life of sin
Now you're having pleasure
There ain't no givin' in
Do you ever wonder
Do you ever think
What may lie beyond you
What's the missing link

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your heart will see... eternal dark

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your heart will see... eternal dark
