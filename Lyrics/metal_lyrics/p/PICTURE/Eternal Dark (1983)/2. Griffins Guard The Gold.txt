In the distance, the golden mountains shining softly
Tempting those who dare
We're all poor men, our simple meaning traveling onwards
Come to claim our share

Never take the mountain stone
Griffons guard the gold
Listen to the legend told
Griffons guard the gold

At the gateway, to reach the fortune, stands a keeper
Who wants us stop to try
Telling our souls, creature's guarding strength of lion
With evil's eyes of fire

Never take the mountain stone
Griffons guard the gold
Listen to the legend told
Griffons guard the gold

Never take the mountain stone
Griffons guard the gold
Listen to the legend told
Griffons guard the gold

Never take the mountain stone
Griffons guard the gold
Listen to the legend told
Griffons guard the gold
