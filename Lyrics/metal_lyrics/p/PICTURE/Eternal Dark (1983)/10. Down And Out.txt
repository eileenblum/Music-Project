Will someone tell me what, I'm heading to
Got no place to go, nothing happens new
Nothing new, no nothing new

I don't like pretending, something's coming my way
Level is descending, live from day to day

Because I really don't know, no no no
What I'm waiting for
What you're waiting for
What were waiting for
We're down and out
We're down and out
Down and out
Down and out

See my life is passing, in front of my eyes
Is this really living, everybody dies
Yes we die
I'm chasing my direction, following the sun
Living like a lion
Live for number one

Because I really don't know, no no no
What I'm waiting for
What you're waiting for
What we're waiting for
We're down and out
We're down and out
Down and out
Down and out

Because I really don't know, no no no
What I'm waiting for
What you're waiting for
What we're waiting for
We're down and out
We're down and out
Down and out
We're down and out
What I'm waiting for
What you're waiting for
What we're waiting for
Into the underworld, yeah, into the underworld
