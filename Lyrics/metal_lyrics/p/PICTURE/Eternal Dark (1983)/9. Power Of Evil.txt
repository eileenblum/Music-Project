You don't believe in the Prince of Darkness
You don't wanna' receive it
You don't believe that this could happen here,
Try to open your eyes

Don't try to calculate, the power of evil
Don't underestimate, the power of evil

You see them dancing in circles round the fire
They have a good reason
You think it's strange but this is no liar
They have their religion

Don't try to calculate, the power of evil
Don't underestimate,  the power of evil

You don't believe in the Prince of Darkness
You don't wanna' receive it
You don't believe that this could happen here
Try to open your eyes

Don't try to calculate, the power of evil
Don't underestimate, the power of evil

Yeah, the power of evil

Don't try to calculate, the power of evil
Don't underestimate, the power of evil
