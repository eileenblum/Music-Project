Well every night, you tell me the same
What's your reason, what's your game?
Why do you torture me?
Tell no lies
Tell no lies

You say you're out, on your own
You won't be late but, you don't come home
Why do you torture me?
Tell no lies
Tell no lies

Well every night, you tell me the same
What's your reason, what's your game
Why do you torture me?
Tell no lies
Tell no lies
