Shooting into space, I'm a soldier in the sky
Fighting for our race, many of us die
Battle for the universe, we offer our lives

Go, to their planet and attack
We, know that we may not get back

At the speed of light, our forces will destroy
Those who want to fight
And those who want to die
Battle for the universe, we offer our lives

Go, to their planet and attack
We, know that we may not get back

Battle for the Universe
We offer our lives

When the war will end, no one ever knows
The universe will fight
And never stop to grow

Battle for the universe, we offer our lives

Go, to their planet and attack
We, know that we may not get back

Battle for the universe, we offer our lives
Battle for the universe, we offer our lives
