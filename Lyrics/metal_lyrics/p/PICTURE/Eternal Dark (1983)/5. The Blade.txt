As he crawls from his lair
His eyes are filled with hate
His right hand grasps his blade
To kill, he cannot wait
Lives at night, hides at day
His evil mind will plan
Another way to do his task
Destroying what he can

We all know he will kill
Living from our meat
Shows no pity, shows no soul
This beast has to eat
Maybe one day we will find
A way to hunt him out
Maybe one day we will find
A way to make him shout

Where do we run from here
Filling our blood with fear
Sending us to the grave
No man can take The Blade

Where do we run from here
Filling our blood with fear
Sending us to the grave
No man can take The Blade

As he crawls from his lair
His eyes are filled with hate
His right hand grasps his blade
To kill, he cannot wait
Lives at night, hides at day
His evil mind will plan
Another way to do his task
Destroying what he can

Where do we run from here
He fills our blood with fear
Sending us to the grave
No man can take The Blade

Take The Blade
