The thunder's coming over the sea
The wind, it wails and moans
Don't let the wind accomplish your deeds,
Don't do it alone

Gonna make you burn
Gonna make you burn

The Reaper is watching, all of the time
He can easily wait
It's no use pretending, or asking me why
Everybody turns waits.

When the time is right, he'll take you to Hell
Pray for your sins, and you'll learn

He's gonna make you burn

Repentance is nothing, nothing to him
Sitting up on his throne
Beast of fire, spreads his wings
He will jar your bones

Gonna make you burn
Gonna make you burn

Now you're sorry for what you have done
Never thought this could be
Too late to hide, nowhere to run
Maybe now you see

When the time is right, he'll take you to Hell
Pray for your sins and you'll learn
He's gonna make you burn

When the time is right, he'll take you to Hell
Pray for your sins and you'll learn

When the time is right, he'll take you to Hell
Pray for your sins and you'll learn
He's gonna make you burn
Gonna make you burn
Gonna make you burn
Gonna make you burn
Gonna make you burn
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gonna make you burn
Burn!
