He's a player, he plays a guitar, here him play and he plays so loud,
He's a swinger, he's a rocker, listen to him and swing it out.
Do do do do do, do do do do do do do etc.

He's a jumper, he's a runner, once he played and wheal about,
Shooting thunder, his guitar cry's, come on, let's shout it out loud
Do do do do do, do do do od do do do etc.
