Oh oh oh ooh ooh oh...
Last night, I walk along the street, I saw a stranger coming near,
I felt I felt a terrible heat, it fill my body with fear.
Oh oh oh.....

The air, the air was trembling, it was, it was so weird,
The air.... was glowing, and then it disappeared.
It frightened me so, had no place to go,
I want to scream and shout, want to spit it out, oh yes, spit it out.

Oh oh oh...
Last week, I laid in bed, felt a strange thing in my head,
There's growing, there's growing something inside, I was afraid, I wanted to hide...

Last night, walked along the street, I saw a stranger coming near,
I felt, I felt a terrible heat, it fill my body with fear.
Wooh oh whoh, oh oh.....
