Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
When you're in music daddy said you go to hell,
You'd better watch out, and listen what I got to tell.
You think your helpless, it doesn't mean nothing at all,
You will be nothing you better notice my call,
Get back or you fall.

When you are playing, you think that you're doing well,
You think it's heaven but you will see heaven means hell.
You think your great, you think your climbing a wall,
You will be nothing, you better notice my call,
Get back or you fall.

When you are playing, you think that you're doing well,
You think it's heaven, but you will see heaven means hell.
You think your great, you think your climbing a wall,
You will be nothing, you better notice my call,
Get back or you fall.
Get back or you fall.
