Don't cross my life, don't drink my wine, you better stay right there, I know you wouldn't dare,
To cross my street, to take my seat, don't you feel, that this is real.
You don't have my sex appeal, everything I got is real,
One way street, one way street, one way street.

Don't put my streets, don't take my seat, I got all I need, this is a one way street,
Don't you feel, that it's real, go away, listen what I say.
You don't have a sex appeal, everything I got is real,
One way street, one way street, one way street.

One way street, one way street, one way street.

You're just a jealous guy, don't have to tell you why,
I'd better find you, so you know it's true.
I am strong, I know you're wrong,
I knock you down, you're just a clown.
You don't have my sex appeal, everything I got is real,
One way street, one way street, one way street.
One way street, one way street, one way street.
