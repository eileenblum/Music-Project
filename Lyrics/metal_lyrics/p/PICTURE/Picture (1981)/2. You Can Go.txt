I lost my baby when I got into the rock and roll, yeah,
Cause when I'm rockin', I'm always losing control, yeah.
She condemn me when I was on the road, so I said,
You can go, you can go, you can go oh oh oh.

When I was home I always tried to please her,
Cause I need her and I don't want to lose her.
But she gets angry when I was on the road, so I said,
You can go, you can go, you can go oh oh oh.

Now I'm lonely and I got into the rock and roll, yeah,
I like it and I never lose control, yeah.
Ain't got no one to stay on my site, well I say,
I can go, I can go, I can go oh oh oh,
I can go, I can go, I can go oh oh oh,
I can go, I can go, I can go oh oh oh,
I can go, I can go, I can go oh oh oh,
