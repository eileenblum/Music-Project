We bring you in, bring you in another dimension,
Gotta do it, do it with another intention.
Gotta do it to you baby, we've gotta do it to ya baby,
Rockin' in your brains, your brains, rockin' in your brains.

Got no time, got no time to run away,
Got no power to put that smile away.
We gotta do it to you baby, we've gotta do it to you baby,
Rockin' in your brains.

Got no present, and music gets you in a trance,
Come on and shake it, stamp your feed and clap your hands.
Gotta do it to you baby, we've gotta do it to ya baby,
Rockin' in your brains, your brains, rockin in your brains, your brains.
