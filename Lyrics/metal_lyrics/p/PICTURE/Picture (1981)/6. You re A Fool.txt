Don't be down, and wait for the hour,
That you come back I know it sounds sour.
Just down and let your head hang down,
Everybody's laughing at you in this town.
You're a fool.

We all knew, but you didn't want to know,
She's a hooker we knew that see would go.
You was too proud having a girl of your own,
She's only used you, so now you're alone.
You're a fool.

Don't be down, and wait for the hour,
That she will come back I know it sounds sour.
Just don't, don't let your head hang down,
Everybody's laughing at you in this town. Ha ha ha ha....
You're a fool. Ha ha ha ha...
