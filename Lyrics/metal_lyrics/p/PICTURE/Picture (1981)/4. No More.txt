I lay I lay in the sun, I got nothing to do, I'm sick and tired I must live, must live, live without you,
Never felt, never felt so alone, never been on my own.
Oh, run away from me no more.

I've been looking for love, a love that I have found, I've been hoping that you, come back safe and sound.
Come back and stay with me, my love is real, you will see.
Oh, run away from me no more.

Now I'm living with you, I feel no cold, I love you baby, you got, you got a heard of gold.
Come back and stay with me, my love is real, you will see.
Oh, run away from me no more.
