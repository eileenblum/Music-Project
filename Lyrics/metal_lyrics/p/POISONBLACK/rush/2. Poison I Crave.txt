Again, I stand in line to sell my soul again
And waiting for the mercy of death
Erase, when I am gone so swept away
As I take, take the fatal breath

For just the taste of your sweet poison I crave

Again, she is screaming out my name again
Deceiving, and leading me astray
Erase, let the darkness blind my agony
Yet leave, leave a fire to show the way

For just the taste of your sweet poison
For just the taste of your sweet poison I crave

She's for the one who wants pain to be over
She's for the one who is kissing the devil's hand
And the light that grows colder is over
To look in her eyes is for you to believe, understand

I stand in line to take the blame
As she is screaming out my name
I stand in line to take the blame
For just the taste of your sweet poison I crave

She's for the one who wants pain to be over
She's for the one who is kissing the devil's hand
And the light that grows colder is over
To look in her eyes is for you to believe, understand

She doesn't want my pain to be over
She is the one who is offering the devil's hand
And the light that grew colder takes over
To look in her eyes is for you to believe, understand
