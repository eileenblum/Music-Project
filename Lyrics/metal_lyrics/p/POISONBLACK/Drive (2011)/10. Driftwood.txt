Left wading neck-high in dirt
by the flood of wastewaters
Completely soaked to the bone
Floating restless in time pining out
Through the unending struggles
Straight towards the unknown with nothing to hold onto

Always against the stream
Beating through debris
But as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Always against the stream
Riding on the belief
That as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright

Left sailing the sea of dirt
on a raft that is leaking
Moved by the stench of the wind
Waiting the high-tide to come
to finally sink in
In the scum-tsunami with nothing to hold onto

Always against the stream
Beating through debris
But as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Always against the stream
Riding on the belief
That as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright


Thanks to sami-kiiskinen for correcting track #1 lyrics.
