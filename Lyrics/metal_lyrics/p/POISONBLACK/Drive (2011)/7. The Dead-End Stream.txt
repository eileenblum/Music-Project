Flowers in bloom
It's a beautiful day
Headed for doom
Destruction and decay

Stare at the sun
the warm rays of light
Nowhere to run
We've already lost the fight

Hand in hand we wait this all to end

Everything dies - Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
While floating down the dead-end stream until it's time
to drown away

Life is so sweet
So seize the day
Destiny's sealed
And soon to pine away
Enjoy while you can
Breathe in, breathe out
Try and understand, the only way is out

Gun in hand we wait this all to end

Everything dies - Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
While floating down the dead-end stream until it's time..

No one gets out of here alive -
No one comes back to testify
So enjoy while you can my child-
We only got this one time

Everything dies - Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
While floating down the dead-end stream until it's time...
