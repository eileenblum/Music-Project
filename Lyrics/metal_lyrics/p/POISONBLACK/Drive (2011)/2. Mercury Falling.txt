Let's celebrate this suffering
While the grave is still warm
We've got no time to lose
Let's set fire on everything In
honor of flame to be gone
We've got nothing to lose

Kiss before the fall

Hearts beating fast
Let's make the moment last for
tomorrow''a doom is already gleaming
It's gone so fast
Let go, forgive the past for the
mercury of life keeps falling
falling down

Let's enjoy this suffering
disillusioned and free
We've still got time to choose
Let's desire everything
the name of extinction to be
We've got us to abuse

Kiss before the fall

Hearts beating fast
Let's make the moment last for
tomorrow''a doom is already gleaming
It's gone so fast
Let go, forgive the past for the
mercury of life keeps falling
falling down
