I fill the chamber bullet by bullet
Hoping this time it won't jam
To play a round of the northern roulette
and leave this world with a bang
Just on squeeze and all will cease
One for the gun to drown the last line of defense
I'm ready for hell

I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
To come and peck the flesh off of my bones

I oil the rope to be sure the knot slides
Tie down the other end tight
Stand on a chair and close my eyes
Knowing this it's alright
A step.. just one and all is done
One for the rope to drown the last line of defense
I'm ready for hell

I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
They're hovering close
-Oh so close
They've come to drag me down to the unknown
Let them peck the flesh off of my bones

I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
They're hovering close
- Oh so close
They've come to drag me down to the unknown
They're close.. oh so close
Won't need no coroner to tag my toe
Let them peck the flesh off of my bones
