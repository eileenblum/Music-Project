So you thought you had it made
All on that shining silver plate
Now you're turning a brand new page
Not a word disappearing without a trace
You've spawned just rage

Have a nice rest of your life for
it's all you've got

Until it rains ice in hell
the shit will keep on rolling out your mouth
No more of you - It's zero tolerance
Can you hear the final bell it 
tolls for you that there is no doubt
We are through now - This is where it ends

Black is white-Red is green
Spit it out! Say what you mean
Trust is earned not ingratiated
The bridge is burned, the past contaminated
Annihilated

Better to be hated for what you are
than loved for what you're not

Until it rains ice in hell
the shit will keep on rolling out your mouth
No more of you - It's zero tolerance
Can you hear the final bell it
tolls for you that there is no doubt
We are through now - This is where it ends
