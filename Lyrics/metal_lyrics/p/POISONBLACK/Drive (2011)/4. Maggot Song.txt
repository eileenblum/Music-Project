Through the six-feet of dirt they
claim to hear the sound of the pouring rain
Saying it's me up here pissing on your grave
The stench of shit gathers more of flies to run
their mouths
Them brainless know not
what they're talking about

It's the outcome of severe inbreeding

Back then, now and always
you maggots will be crawling by my side
Keeping the flame of hate alive
Until the hell freezes over I will
be the cold thorn right there in your side
I promise you rain tonight

From behind them aliases
pathetically trying to point their gun
To me it's none for all and all for none
It must be hard without them brain cells
to try and understand
With empty pig-ass-eyes to make a stand

Hooray for the severe inbreeding

Back then, now and always
you maggots will be crawling by my side
Keeping the flame of hate alive
Until the hell freezes over I will
be the cold thorn right there in your side
I promise you rain tonight
