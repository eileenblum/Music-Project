Down this road again and it feels like beneath
the dust of time
Down this road once again and it seems this will be until
the end of my time

Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me

Along this road once again
still it seems like it leads nowhere but away
Along this road once again
still it seems that it has been always this way

Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me

Scars are made to remind

Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me

And oh how these years have been long
while humming the notes of the dead man's song
Oh how I wish they would fade
all of them wounds I know it's too late

Scars are made to remind
