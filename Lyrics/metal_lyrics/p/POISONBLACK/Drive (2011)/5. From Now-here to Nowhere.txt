This is where it ends
I can't have the years wasted back
Re-invent something I've lost how to feel

The table is set for three
Indifference, you and me and we
sit there in silence
Don't care to speak
It's not temporary
It's our cemetery
And we are carved in stone

From now-here to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece.. want nothing from you
From bitter to worse
Oh so revengefully yours
We've done our time - Just let us go

This is where it ends
I'm getting the hell out of here
Leaving nothing behind - It was never real

The hole is dug for three
Suffering, you and me and we
lay there in silence
 No need to speak
It's finally here - No anguish, no fear
And we are free at last

From now-here to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece.. want nothing from you
I love you
I hate you
I'll sing when you're dead
I loathe you
I need you
I'll scream and regret

From now-here to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece.. want nothing from you
From bitter to worse
Oh so revengefully yours
We've done our time - Just let us go
