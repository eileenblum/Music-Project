Full throttle, speed ahead
Punish the roaring engine
Burnt rubber, the scent of lead
Fast down the highway

Flames feed on gasoline
Bone crushing heavy pressure
Tight left, adrenaline
I'm on my way

Oil as blood under the hood,
Pumping freely through

I live behind the wheel
The dusty grey keeps calling me
So I drive through the night
Another city, another scene
Straight ahead aimlessly-
The open road is my bride
This is life on the fast lane

Sparks fly, dynamite
Bullet on wheels, explosive
Hit the gas, tight right
And on I go

Black leather, paint glows red
Horny pair of legs beside me
Speed junkie, piston head
And on I go

Oil as blood under the hood,
pumping freely through

I live behind the wheel
The dusty grey keeps calling me
So I drive through the night
Another city, another scene
Straight ahead aimlessly-
The open road is my bride
This is life on the fast lane
