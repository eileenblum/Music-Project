Can't push aside this feeling no longer I'm able
I need to poison myself to stay sane and stable

I've lost control of everything I've kept inside me
Slipping on razor's edge I hope you'd finally find me

But I justify my desire to no one
I won't deny that I need it bad to go on

My jaded heart is yours to poison with your flame

Take me away over to somewhere
Where the fire reigns and where nothing else remains
Together alone waiting for nothing
In where the fire reigns and where nothing else remains

Looking through broken glass I see the twisted faces
Spitting and smiling at me with sharpened embraces
