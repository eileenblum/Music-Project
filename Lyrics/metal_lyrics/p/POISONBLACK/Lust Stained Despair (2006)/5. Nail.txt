A pure smooth pearl a sweet disorder swaying in the dress
An electric fur in lace a whoredom blooms between her legs
Just one look into those heavenly pair of "take me" - eyes
Mine's the pleasure as I force-feed her all my lies

The redhot nail inside of you is me

I am the nail
Now drunk on lust I drown in you
Tension prevails and it takes me over again
I am the nail
Forever within I'm lost in you
Deeper with pain as it takes me over again

I taste lead in every drop I spit out my throat
I crave death with every kiss I can't live without
An overwhelming state is burning through my every vein
Mine's the pleasure as I force-feed her all my pain
