I see black
I see red
As all the other shades are beaten dead
You're pure crystal
The tempting sin
Can't you see that I am giving in... to you?

This is the state you've left me breathing in
Struggling between this hate and suffering

Come, shake the leeches off me
and help me see through bloodshot eyes
Don't close the circle around me
for hollow will be my name
I feel black
I feel red
As all the other emotions are playing dead
You're living fire
The cunning lie
Can't you see how we both deserve to die?

This is the state you've left me rotting in
Struggling between this guilt and suffering

Come, shake the leeches off me and help me see through bloodshot eyes
Don't say you won't die with me for we are one we are the same
Come, break the silence in me and help me cleanse the bloodstained lies
Don't close the circle around me for hollow will be my name
