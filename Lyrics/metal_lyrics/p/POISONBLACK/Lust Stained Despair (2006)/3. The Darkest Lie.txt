There you lay
Innocence in heat
The tension builds up with the scent so sweet

And you close your eyes

And you give into it wholly
And you inhale the scent unholy

Come and praise the darkest lie

Here I lay
In my darkest suit
The afterglow's devouring all of the truth

And I close my eyes

And I give into it wholly
And I inhale the scent unholy

Come and praise the darkest lie
And on and on we...
