Eyelash dead on a pale white cheek
Couldn't stay awake to bleed
I drank long and deep from the fount unwillingly pouring it in
What I did suck from that scentless mouth was the taste of the nothing

What is the life for the dead at heart?

What my soul is concealing
this life unforgiving cannot take away from me
It's buried so deep within
And so I confide in you
For nothing compares to you
I live in the moment and in the faith that it gives

I wanted but could not outlive the pain... constantly taking the blame
I wanted but could not smother the flame and then I heard you scream out my name

I've found the life for the dead at heart

And as I close my eyes I see everything
So much clearer than ever before
And as I step inside to feel everything...
I am still the living dead
