[bonus track]

I saw sunsets fall to ash
I sink down below without you
Into the long-term torture, far from the soothing light
where everything I'd sacrifice
to keep you here with me
and give a name to this pain I hold so dear

What a feeling again
As iron cuts open
The all-ending grace of you
What heaven once sent
The devil has broken
so I am bleeding into you

deep behind those pure-green eyes
there's the spark that lights itself aflame
only needs one look and the hollow becomes ablaze
for pain I suffered into bliss
peeling petals one by one
Until the curtain falls I lay my trust in you

what a feeling again
As iron cuts open
The all-ending grace of you
What heaven once sent
The devil has broken
so I am bleeding into you
