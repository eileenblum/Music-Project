I cannot tolerate the pain
Still feeling
Still-feeling
I cannot execute this pain
Still bleeding
Still-bleeding

Come and set my world afire
Give all that I desire

I am a soul on fire
with flames within yet frozen to the bone
I want you... come into me
I'm holding onto desire
which binds it all that I will fall for
I want you... come into me

I cannot flee from the pain
Still hiding
Still-hiding
I cannot see from this pain
Still lying
Still-lying?
