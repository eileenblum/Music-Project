I am waiting for the ricochet
as I'm reaching towards the shadow
I feel the scorching fire... redeemer
Desire to burn through alive... and on and on

I am flesh and blood the weakness
I am heart and soul... desire
Place my finger on the trigger
Make the darkness as my bride

My soul is spoken for to the one I'm breathing for
This pain for you is never enough
Craving forevermore for the one I'm dying for
Do you know how much I want you
Do you know I've lost control
It's so much stronger than me
All that I want yet never enough
