All this time I've been dreaming of it
All this time it's been haunting in my dead
Tempting me,
inviting me to fall asleep in its arms
To fall from grace,
to breathe its ever-dimming dusk

Through my eyes
you could see the hurt I crave
Through my eyes
you'd see there's nothing left to save
I heard you said: "There's a light up ahead",
but I am heading towards a dead end
I just can't say no,
I just can't let go for it's got me bent

I crave therefore I am and that is all I ever feel
I hope you'd understand...
Once love, one pain, one enemy
I toast to misery as I dig into the devils bone
And for eternity the pain becomes me
and won't leave me alone
