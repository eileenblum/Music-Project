(I wish) To flee and to be gone... detached from myself
(I want) To see clearly what's beyond the dreary and cold walls within my head

I exist in desire in my dark haven
I long to cleanse my soul of regrets

All I want is you to be there
and no longer feel dead inside
I'm in love controlled despair
Wish to sleep and leave all behind

(I wish) To set free and to forgive... An illusion of myself
(I want) To breathe and to truly live without the claws within my head
