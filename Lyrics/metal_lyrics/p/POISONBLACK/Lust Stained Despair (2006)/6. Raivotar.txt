Queen of the damned the bitch of Hades... the serpent
Sixes tripled in her flesh
Lobotomize my thoughts, my mind... unleash me
Bring forth the perfect sin I crave

Escape from you to stay alive
Escape from you... the liar
Yet I crawl to you to feel alive
I crawl for same desire

And once again...
She is dancing on my grave
Whipping shivers down my spine
She is dancing on my grave
Pouring down the mercy of death

Queen of the tease the hot and cold... voracious
So deadly and deceiving eyes
Lobotomize my thoughts, my mind... release me
Bring forth the perfect death I crave

I feel you're coming once again
