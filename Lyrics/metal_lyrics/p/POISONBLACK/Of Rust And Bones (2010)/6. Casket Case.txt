Once there was a man who was made out of glass
A castaway man whom everyone did pass

Don't waste your words on me - I've crossed the line - I don't care
I'm waiting for that final day to break that god damned bottle's neck, yeah

Once there was a man who dreamt of six feet high
A castaway man who now just wants to die

Don't waste your love on me - I've changed my mind - I don't care
A step away from that final day to break the god damned bottle's neck

Rejoice, the pig is dead
Fell on his knees and blew away his head
Make noise, the pig is dead
Running on empty - no more shit to shed
The shotgun sang
No choice, he's done, he's dead
Down on his knees he blew away his head
Make noise, the pig is dead
Running on empty - No more shit to shed
The shotgun sang
