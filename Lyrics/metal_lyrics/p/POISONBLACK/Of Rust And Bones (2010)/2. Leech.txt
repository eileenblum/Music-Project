Got lost somehow in your piss soaked life
but I'm here for you now
Can you taste it? The flavour of shit in your mouth
It is a vomit a coming

Since I crawled in and made you mine - gave you hate
Your life has been a complete waste of time - each day
I lie and take - you bleed and ache
Can't you see your world revolves around this?
You can't deny it, can't flush me away
I will always be here for you

Got a friend somehow - someone to stab in the back?
To make use of your own ends
Still you fake it? That pearl white sincere smile
I feel how it's draining you
