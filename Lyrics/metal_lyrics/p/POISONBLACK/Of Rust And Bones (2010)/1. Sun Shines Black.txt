Hope is gone... ashes in the wind
All that was is buried in filth
The shadows grow deeper with each passing hour
The taste of life has turned too sour

I am but ghost in time - time unforgiving
I am the failed design - without a meaning

Can't recall those days of old
Some were stolen, some were sold
They won't ever come back
Pages turned, time after time
Bridges burned and left behind
But my sun still shines black

The rust is spreading, eating the bones
The spirit is lame... the head explodes
