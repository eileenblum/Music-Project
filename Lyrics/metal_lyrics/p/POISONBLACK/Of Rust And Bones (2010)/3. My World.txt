Annoying creature of the night
You're the ever oozing wound that bleeds
Spills into my life
Not a healthy state of mind
A constant pain that keeps on lingering
Praying into my life

With a cleansing fire of hate - purify

So come on try and to be me
where filthy mouths and fingers feed
Then kick you to your downward course
Maybe if you've had a life you'd have a better clue 'bout mine
Until then keep on wasting yours

With your narrow minded views
you try to make us look like fools again
And you're so cool again
Steal a piece of my time
It makes you feel so alive
In leech's paradise
