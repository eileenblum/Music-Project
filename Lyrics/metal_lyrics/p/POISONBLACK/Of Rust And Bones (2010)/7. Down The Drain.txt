The spiral leads down the drain - nothing is changing
All the struggling in vain...
We just keep on sinking - so low
There's loathing between us
A city dying of thirst
There's a romance between us but it only hurts

Nothing more to be said or done - it's all over now
I'm amazed that we got this far and dodged the bullet somehow
Time to bury all dreams - bury everything
Time to silence the screams which echo within
All down the drain - I will drown your name and be free

There's nothing left we can do - let's just lay this to rest
Hell knows we've tried to
This is as good as it gets
You said; "I'm at the end of my rope
Honey, I've been hanging for years
Here, at the end of our hope - still no tears

You must've mistaken me for someone who gives a shit about you
You - who?
You never should've trusted me for I am a sack of shit
I won't shed a tear for you
