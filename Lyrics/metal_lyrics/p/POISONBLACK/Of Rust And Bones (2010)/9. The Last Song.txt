There is not much in this life I enjoy anymore
Everything's fading
The black hole within keeps on growing and swallowing all Hell is awaiting
I've floated through years in the shades of bloodred and grey
Just hanging on
Now tight is the noose 'round my neck as I yield, slip away
Soon I'll be gone

Dying of thirst I am
Dying for thirst I am

Where did I go wrong?
This life's been drowned for far too long
And I know this is the last call
Where did I belong?
This road has strayed for far too long
And I know I'm at the end this is the last song

I've burned every bridge that I've built so the river runs wild
Everything's fading
I tore down the lives of the loved ones with razorblade smile
Hell is awaiting
I've floated through yearsin the shades of bloodred and grey
Just hanging on
Now tight is the noose 'round my neck as I yield, slip away
Soon I'll be gone

Deny for thirst I can
Rely on thirst I can
