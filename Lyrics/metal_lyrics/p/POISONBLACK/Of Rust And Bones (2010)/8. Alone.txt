You're the pearl in the trashcan of my life
I am the beggar a useless stain in time
Can't you see how I grieve...
What you mean to me?

Let's grow cold together - alone

The rain it beats...
Ripping flesh down to the bone
Leaving me hanging onto you
I pray to keep the beating of this tired heart
Long enough, so I can live this through

You're my world... the bullet in my gun
I am the doubt... black is my sun
Can't you see how I need you to bury me?
