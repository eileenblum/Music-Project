[Musik: Kukkonen &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

Her sharpened nails in my flesh make me crave for more
Her chilling cold caress makes me feel so warm
She's my addiction, the one... the one I love , my whore
She's my redemption, the one... the one I hate and adore

And with her I die
And for her I die
She's my mistress of pain

I burn in flames of lust... I covet, I crave, I desire
In her I lay all my trust as the flames grow higher
She's my addiction, the one...the one I love , my whore
She's my redemption, the one... the one I hate and adore

And with her I die
And for her I die
and therefore I sigh, she's my mistress of pain
