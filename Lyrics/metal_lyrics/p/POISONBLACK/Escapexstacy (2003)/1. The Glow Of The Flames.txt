[Musik &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

Temptation awaits as she opens the gates
and I kneel down before her
The scent of her rides in the breath of the night
and I'm breathing the curse

I breathe and I drown in the circle of fire
the glow of the flames
And I embrace the demon-desire
the glow of the flames in my eyes

The pleasure and pain... now they are the same
for I have fell from grace
I've been waiting for so long for the feeling this strong
for this bliss of escape

I breathe and I drown in this funeral pyre
the glow of the flames
and I embrace the demon-desire
the glow of the flames in my eyes
