[Musik &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

I've fallen from grace into the kingdom of shadowlands
into the pleasure's nest
This pale death on my face I've come to love and understand
when I laid my heart to rest

And I believe in one thing forevermore, to live is to love the pain
And I feel like I never felt before, the rapture of dying

Slow, deep and hard through your frail and virgin mind
will flow ist lifeless zest
Take it in your heart and you will become my kind
just lay your heart to rest

And you believe in one thing forevermore, to live is to love pain
And you feel like you never felt before, the rapture of dying
And you believe in one thing forevermore, to live is to love pain
And you feel like you never felt before, the rapture of dying
