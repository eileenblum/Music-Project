[Musik: Kukkonen &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

In my darkest hour I breathe out the name and sigh
I'm for her to devour to rape with whips of shame... and I sigh

The state I ache to be in, the state I crave for

The bringer of the night
reveals the blessing disguised with one touch
A shepherd for her blind, a light into these eyes... with one touch

The state I ache to be in, the state I crave for

So, can you see I believe by the blood that I seep
that it's worth all the hurt
and the tears that I desperately weep
Can you see I believe and no longer grieve
And it's worth all the hurt and the fears that I desperately keep
