[Musik &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

Come...the thick night and breathe in me
Yes, come...with lifeless eyes and die with me
Burn... unleash the holy smoke to flee
Yes, burn... deceased and buried is misery

To live in desire is to play with the fire
that burns within our every cell
Dying eternal, love infernal... just one kiss to feel the spell
So fall and surrender the weak pretender
Don't resist the call of hell
Dying eternal, love infernal... just one kiss to feel the spell

Heart... kill the heart make the beating cease
Yes, heart... the chained emotions crave for release
Souls... together entwined in debauchery
Yes, souls... flee beyond divinity
