[Musik &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

You're under my skin the poison within
Diabolical rapture that's dripping with sin
Break down my will, a kiss for the kill
Bury me deep between death and the thrill

Your name is desire, loins of fire
The lust incarnate, an angel, a liar
Break down my will, a kiss for the kill
Bury me deep between death and the thrill

Let glow red the poison sun and the flame to make me numb
Let me hear the words witch I have been dying to hear
Burn my fingers one by one, guide me down into the sun
Let me show you how I crave to make you come

You looked at me deep and made me weep
You gave me my sin, my soul now keep
Broke down my will, kissed for the kill
Buried me deep between death and the thrill
