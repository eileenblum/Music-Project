[Musik &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

Close... the shadows creep close
A failure drifting lost in cold embrace
Pain...every cut of pain
Makes him bleed and weak, fall from grace

On and on I bleed... on and on I bleed

Walk... circles I walk
Awaiting for that sweet cure to seep in
Night... I'm breathing the night
It conceals the stairway to heaven within

Drive into the night... I drive into the night
Drunk on pain I taste the kiss of death

It's just as I dreamed this feeling surreal fades my life away
And yes, it's meant to be this way, no more fears or pain
As death is talking care of my life
