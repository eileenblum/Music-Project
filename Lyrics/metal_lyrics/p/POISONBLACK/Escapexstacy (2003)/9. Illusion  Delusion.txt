[Musik: Kukkonen &amp; Lyrik: Laihiala]

And she cradles me down into sleep
Still I miss her so and for more I weep
And she gives me death yet I'm alive
Craving eternally, on her I thrive

We are one, we are the same
Burning with brightest flame

I am the strange illusion, don't feel too real
A catatonic thing that should not be
You are the seewt delusion yet you feel so real
for all these wounds I have only you can heal

And she buries me down far too deep
Yet six-feet high and gives me bliss to keep
And she abuses me yet I abide
She's in demand, my hunger I cannot hide
