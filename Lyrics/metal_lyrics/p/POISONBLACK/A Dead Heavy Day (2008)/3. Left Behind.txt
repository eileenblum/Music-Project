"The days of bending over are over!"

I am closing
Shutting down this need so vain
For this time around
I won't live the past again

I have chosen
To leave your trap so far behind
To bury your face
I have failed but not this time

Then I feel you slashing through me

I am the one you tried to leave behind
I am the guilt you'll always feel (taste the pain)
Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain)
And I will take you to the end

I'm inhaling
The scent of everything I've done
To bury disgrace
Is to pull the trigger...
I am done

Then I feel you slashing through me

I am the one you tried to leave behind
I am the guilt you'll always feel (taste the pain)
Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain)
And I will take you to the end

[Solo: Laihiala]

Then I feel you slashing through me

I am the one you tried to leave behind
I am the guilt you'll always feel (taste the pain)
Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain)
And I will take you to the end
Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain)
And I will take you to the end...
