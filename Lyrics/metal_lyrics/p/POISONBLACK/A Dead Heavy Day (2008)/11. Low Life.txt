"Just 1 for the road"

Drool runs down from my mouth again
Low-life - I've killed myself again
Time is running out too fast for me
Living in lie is just too much for me

And the next day dawns dead
Off with my head
And the circle begins again
No place left to somber
Not a single rock I can crawl under

Never again or forevermore - Self-deception calls
This heavy lead
Full bottle
Then crawl along the floor

This is the End I won't take anymore - Again the weak one

falls
Straight ahead
Full throttle
Smashed against the wall

I can see that you don't get it
It eats you alive if you let it
That's what I've done
No place left to run
Not a single rock I can crawl under

Never again or forevermore - Self-deception calls
This heavy lead
Full bottle
Then crawl along the floor

This is the End I won't take anymore - Again the weak one

falls
Straight ahead
Full throttle
Smashed against the wall

Never again or forevermore - Self-deception calls
This heavy lead
Full bottle
Then crawl along the floor

This is the End I won't take anymore - Again the weak one

falls
Straight ahead
Full throttle
Smashed against the wall

Never again or forevermore - Self-deception calls
This heavy lead
Full bottle
Then crawl along the floor

This is the End I won't take anymore - Again the weak one

falls
Straight ahead
Full throttle
Smashed against the wall
