"In this room with no doors, A year-old scent of a trust

betrayed"

Drop a word and I shake
That one look and I break down
And then you bury the dead again

Could you ever forgive?
When I let in the lies to give you faith
Please don't raise the dead again

Are we reaching the end?
The shortest straw's been pulled and can't be bent no more
But it ain't over yet

Don't turn away
Listen to me - These words I say to you
It ain't over yet

Cut me down to size
Only you can tear me apart - No lies being told tonight
Love me down to size
Even though I broke your heart - Come ravishing over me

Please believe, this heart is open wide
I'm sick and tired of lying
So step inside - I won't hide
No more

Please believe, this heart is true tonight
I know you're sick and tired of trying
But you are the one
You are the one

Cut me down to size
Only you can tear me apart - No lies being told tonight
Love me down to size
Even though I broke your heart - Come ravishing over me
