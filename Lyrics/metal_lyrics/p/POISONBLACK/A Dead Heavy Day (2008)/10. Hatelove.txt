Hand in hand
A gun in hand
Ready to shoot down a promise again
Tempting lips, burnt fingertips
Ready to tell another lie once again

Hand in hand
A chunk in hand
Ready to take another bite once again
Swollen lips, swaying hips
Able to whisper a lie once again

Floating down this river of shit with you
Can't you see that I am so full of it
And I know you're too

It takes two to play this sick game
Two going insane
So tight is the noose around our necks
Words roll out in vain
Looking for something to blame
Don't you think that enough is already said?

We play this sick game while going insane
So tight is the noose around our necks
Words come out in vain
Looking for someone to blame
Don't you think that too much is already dead?

Hand in hand
A gun in hand
Ready to kill another promise again
Tempting lips, burnt fingertips
Ready to yell another lie once again

Floating down this river of shit with you
Can't you see that I am so full of it
But fuck you too!

It takes two to play this sick game
Two going insane
So tight is the noose around our necks
Words roll out in vain
Looking for something to blame
Don't you think that enough is already said?

We play this sick game while going insane
So tight is the noose around our necks
Words come out in vain
Looking for someone to blame
Don't you think that too much is already dead?
