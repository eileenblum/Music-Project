"I don't want to miss you"

This muting numbness is far from the peace I am searching
Just a twisted silence - Weird tranquillity
An uncomfortable heartless kiss is what you left me with darling
Your twisted violence - Cold audacity

I hate these days between life and death
Cannot feel the warmth of your embrace
Yes there's nothing left of me
I take these days between and lay 'em to rest eternally
And let the memory of your face be just another stranger to me

This soothing numbness is not exactly what I am searching
This pitch-black silence
Deathlike tranquillity
But this uncomfortable heartless bliss is where you left me in darling
But hey, you are forgiven because...

I love these between life and death
Cannot feel the warmth of your embrace
Yes there's nothing left of me
I take these days between and lay 'em to rest eternally
And let the memory of your face be just another stranger to me
I don't want to miss you

I don't want to miss you
I don't want to miss you
I don't want to miss your love
I don't want to miss your love

I hate these days between life and death
Cannot feel the warmth of your embrace
Yes there's nothing left of me
I take these days between and lay 'em to rest eternally
And let the memory of your face be just another stranger to me
