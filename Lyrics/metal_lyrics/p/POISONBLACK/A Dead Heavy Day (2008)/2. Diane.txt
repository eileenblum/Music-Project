"Hoe-Hoe-Hoe"

I see you're shaking your ass on your slut-athon
Still too fat to be fucked but hey keep going on
You've painted your eyes and your scars all black
Denying what you are

You've crossed the line, there's no turning back
With your wet cow-eyes you wave the "fuck me" flag
Sucking the fingers pointed at you
Denying what you are

You say: See you on the other side
What the hell is this other side?
Diane - Tell me is your hell freezing over?
Diane - Is the hunt finally over?

Drop dead gorgeous is what you're not
Two tits and a hole is all that you've got
You search for a heartbeat amid the dead
Becoming what they are

Now open your eyes and see you're lying on a bed
Aching all over as you've fucked with the dead
Tears run down your (s)cum-stained face
You are what you are

You say: See you on the other side
What the hell is this other side?
Diane - Tell me is your hell freezing over??
Diane - Is the hunt finally over?
Diane - Tell me what is behind those eyes?
Diane - Is life regrets and lies?

Diane - Tell me is your hell freezing over?
Diane - Is the hunt finally over?
Diane - Tell me what is behind those eyes?
Diane - Is life regrets and lies?
