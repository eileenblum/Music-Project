"(No)Hope!"

T'was stone on my tongue
So how did I expect you to understand
Conceit grown too strong
True love an excuse to submit, to demand
Please take my hand and kill the sickness within me
I'm sure that you can
Not sure that you can

Did death do us part?
Well, to us now we're truly dead
Oh, suffer my heart
As our funeral still lives in my head
Please stay away and leave the sickness within me
I'm sure that you'll stay away
Dead sure that you'll stay

When you hear this song
Know, everything's gone
And when you hear this song
You know you must bear along
Or are you playing the part as if your heart's forgotten?
Entire
Unscarred

What a perfect disaster
Absorbing shit from left to right
But making love we did master
That constant battle our primal fight
Please touch again and awake the sickness within me
Touch me again dear
Come, touch me again

When you hear this song
Know, everything's gone
And when you hear this song
You know you must bear along
Or are you playing the part as if your heart's forgotten?
Entire
Unscarred

When you hear this song
Know, everything's gone
And when you hear this song
You know you must bear along
Or are you playing the part as if your heart's forgotten?
Entire
Unscarred

When you hear this song
Know, everything's gone so wrong
And when you bear this song
You know you must sing along
Is this not true?
From me to you
I know you can feel it too
