When two becomes one
Life pulls a gun
Many turns to none
Devotion and sharing
Loving and caring
Then it all disappears

It holds onto our fears
And we just want to disappear
Hold our breath right here united in our misery
Torn in the claws of fear
End it all right here inside our bitter agony

When there's nothing there
That we can bear
Just lay beside me here
Indifference prevailing
We fell and we gave in
As it all disappeared

It holds onto our fears
And we just want to disappear
Hold our breath right here united in our misery
Torn in the claws of fear
End it all right here inside our bitter agony
