"Lust and you'll rust"

Enough about you, let's talk about me
My ego refuses to hear or see
To be distressed by your reality

Don't give a fuck about you, it's all about me
I know I control the struggle to be pseudo-free
to keep loss at arms' length
to make you bow and bend

So come and get me babe
Come invade my mind
Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like

So come and take me babe
Are you of my kind?
Laughing in denial when the end is nigh

Enough about you, let's talk about me
My disastrous lies will make you bleed for me
And I will lure you into my reality

Don't give a fuck about you, it's all about me
For I am the big star and you're just a wanna-be, wanna be

with me
Keep your love at arms' length
Can't make me bow and bend

So come and get me babe
Come invade my mind
Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like

So come and take me babe
Are you of my kind?
Laughing in denial when the end is nigh

So come and get me babe
Come invade my mind
Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like

So come and take me babe
Are you of my kind?
Laughing in denial when the end is nigh

So come and get me babe
Come invade my mind
Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like

So come and take me babe
Are you of my kind?
Laughing in denial when the end is nigh
