I'm in need of therapy
So fucked up inside
I cannot hold it in, no more

I am breathing misery
Bursting out pure rage
I am throwing up it all, hey!

What if I'd let you in, threw to the wolves and showed you the darkest corner here
What if I'd gave a fuck and spoke the truth, would it be too much for you to hear?

I dare you to tear me apart

Come, explode inside my head and break these walls of pain
Reign the mayhem inside
Be the last rites to the dead, the-rapist of my brain
Mind-fuck me alive

My brain hurt, my brain hurt, yeah!

The pills I've swallowed
Try numb the pain
Feeling a whole lotta nothing

Completely hollow
Yet full of shit
To be freed I'd give anything

The smell of feces splattered everywhere, hate-diarrhea severe
Thoughts hacked to pieces without a care, with an axe, axe I wave in here

I dare you to tear me apart

Come, explode inside my head and break these walls of pain
Reign the mayhem inside
Be the last rites to the dead, the-rapist of my brain
Mind-fuck me alive

My brain hurts, my brain hurts!

Come, explode inside my head and break these walls of pain
Reign the mayhem inside
Be the last rites to the dead, the-rapist of my brain
Mind-fuck me alive

My brain hurts!
