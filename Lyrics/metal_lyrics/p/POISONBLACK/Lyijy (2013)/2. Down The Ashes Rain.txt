Wade as a dead-weight, bound by an invisible the chains
Deep in the gas cloud, kicking distance from pain
Hold, don't mind about the highs for the lows will abound
Go on, savor those moments stake claim to the ground

You have seen them come and go

Down the ashes rain
It's time to reap now what's been sowed
Time and time again
Staring through unblinking cold
Fade into the unknown

These streets run through you, streets full of undead
Out of excuses, a requiem in your head
Hold on, don't mind about the signs of a losing the game
Go on, savor your anguish stay true to the blame

You have seen them come and go

Down the ashes rain (down in rain)
It's time to reap now what's been sowed
Time and time again
Staring through unblinking cold
Fade into the unknown

Fade into the unknown

Down the ashes rain (down in rain)
It's time to reap now what's been sowed
Time and time again
Staring through unblinking cold

Down the ashes rain
Time and time again
