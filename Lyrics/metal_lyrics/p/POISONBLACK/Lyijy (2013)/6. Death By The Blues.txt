Don't wanna be part of your bullshit-world
I'd rather take a bullet
Shots and implants to ashes burn
Long live the mullet

Go climb back up to the tree

Death by the blues
In words and deeds
It's what I choose
Until the reaper I will meet

Again each other you praise and blame
Which ape will prevail?
On that scale with fake and fame
Where everything is for sale

The ticket's only one-way

Death by the blues
In words and deeds
It's what I choose
Until the reaper I will meet

Like horny moths to the flame you are drawn
It burns with acrid smoke
Rapt in vanity, lowlife-spawn
Another soul is sold

Laugh out loud

Death by the blues
In words and deeds
It's what I choose
Until the reaper I will meet
