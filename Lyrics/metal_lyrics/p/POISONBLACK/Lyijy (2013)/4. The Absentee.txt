So much time wasted in things that have no worth
The hours disappear
Am I running to or from the wave of rebirth
Don't know to hope or to fear

And through the longest night I writheâ¦
And through the longest night I, and through the longest night I writheâ¦

Take this burden from me
Let me step outside and feel
Be no more the absentee

I had em bottled up in the distance of my mind
A seemingly clean slate
All those nameless graves I tried to left behind
No chance to detour fate

And through the longest night I writheâ¦
And through the longest night I, and through the longest night I writheâ¦

Take this burden from me
Let me step outside and feel, let me step outside and feel
Bury this burden for me
And be no more the absentee, be no more the absentee

Take this burden from me
Let me step outside and feel, let me step outside and feel
Bury this burden for me
And be no more the absentee, be no more the absentee

Take this burden from me
Let me step outside and feel, let me step outside and feel
Bury this burden for me
And be no more the absentee, be no more the absentee
