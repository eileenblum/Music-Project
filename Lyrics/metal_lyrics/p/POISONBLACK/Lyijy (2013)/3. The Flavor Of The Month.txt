I walk wearing a crown, self-proclaimed Roaylty
At least compared to you
I'm as good it gets and will be remembered
I know, I was told so

I talk wearing a frown
With arrogance and loathing, I address the punters
I'm the best there is, so beautiful and bold
I've got the touch of gold

No matter how fucked, no matter how fucked I am

The flavor of the month, come and take a bite
Another useless one, another spoon-fed, another spoon-fed mind

I'm the bastard incarnate, an odious deadpan prick
Don't care what you think
I'm the VIP, the morons united
Access all areas

No matter how fucked, no matter how fucked I am

The flavor of the month, come and take a bite
Another useless one, another spoon-fed mind
Thus the rumors linger, envy tongues surround
Thus the pointing finger, being holier than, holier than thou

The flavor of the month, come and take a bite
Another useless one, another spoon-fed mind
Thus the rumors linger, envy tongues surround
Thus the pointing finger, being holier than, holier than thou
