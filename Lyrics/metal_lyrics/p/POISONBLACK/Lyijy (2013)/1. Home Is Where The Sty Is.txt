A pig sweat-dripping
Scratching his balls a male
Since day one the lowest self-esteem, bound to fail

Not a single word
Small talk is done with a fist
Suicidal
Heirloom shotguns and opened wrists

Talks like a stroke in slow motion
Feeling fine, not a day over dead
Drop-dead-ugly, fucked up abortion
Shits while eats, same inside head

This is what northern men are made of
This how northern men are made

Hey honey, don't care what's your name is
Just one thing I crave, take off that dress, I'm your man
Hey honey, flowers belong on graves
I'll drag you down in the shades of shame
Nevertheless I'm your man

Yes I am!

A true self-loather
Head stuck tight in the noose
When given bottle sings his rueful blues through the booze

And them women
Anything goes of course
A masturbator
Yet a long-time fan of intercourse

Agora-xeno-homophobic
An ignorant redneck to the bone
Home is where the vacant sty is
With balls erected the seeds are sown 

This is what northern men are made of
This how northern men are made

Hey honey, don't care what's your name is
Just one thing I crave, take off that dress, I'm your man
Hey honey, flowers belong on graves
I'll drag you down in the shades of shame
Nevertheless I'm your man

Yes I am!

Hey honey, don't care what's your name is
Just one thing I crave, take off that dress, I'm your man
Hey honey, flowers belong on graves
I'll drag you down in the shades of shame
Nevertheless I'm your man

Yes I am!
