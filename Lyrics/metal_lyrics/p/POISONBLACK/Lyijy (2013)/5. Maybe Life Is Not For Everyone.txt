As the old clichÃ© goes, that worn out saying
"That which doesn't kill youâ¦ " Most surely cripple, maim
What goes through the mind of such lively numb?
You better hold on tight son; the worst is yet to come

Pray for Jesus to love you thou your soul he sold
Call suicide hot line and get the "please holdâ¦"
But do not discriminate, hate all equally, alone
Smile is only skin deep, loathing goes right to the bone

It's an eye for an eye

Maybe life is not for everyoneâ¦
Maybe life is not for everyoneâ¦
As they watch you crumble, come undone
They won't mourn, they won't my son
Just lower you down and forget

If it was thought that counts you'd be down to your last straw
Dream to pass the time until the reaper's at your door

Because it's an eye for an eye

Maybe life is not for everyoneâ¦
Maybe life is not for everyoneâ¦
As they watch you crumble, come undone
They won't mourn, they won't my son
Just lower you down
