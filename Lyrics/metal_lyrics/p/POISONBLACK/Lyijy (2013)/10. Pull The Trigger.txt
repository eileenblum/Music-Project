Suffering ends, no matter what you do
There's no escape, soon it will be through
Payback will come, consequence is sealed
It won't expire no, it won't yield

Don't you try and repent, don't you dare to deceive
Cause not a single word they will believe

Everyone waits for you to pull the trigger
Everyone's cheering for you
The shit you drown yourself in is getting thicker, don't let them down
They're counting on you

Licked them clean, the bones they threw
Laughed through the tears while playing the fool
My friend you're gone, you're in too deep
Your sad existence is now, is theirs to keep, yeah

Keep bullshitting them, yourself you can't anymore
You know how it ends, you know the score

Everyone waits for you to pull the trigger
Everyone's cheering for you
The shit you drown yourself in is getting thicker, don't let them down
They're counting on you

Different day, shit stays the same, face against the floor
Keep on dreaming through the shame, behind closed doors

Everyone waits for you to pull the trigger
Everyone's cheering for you
The shit you drown yourself in is getting thicker, don't let them down
They're counting on you

Everyone waits for you to pull the trigger
Everyone's cheering for you yeah
The shit you drown yourself in is getting thicker, don't let them down
They're counting on you
