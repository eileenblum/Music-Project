[Japanese Bonus Track]Hey it's still me there, breathin' down your neck
Hammering hard on the human wreck
Hey it's still me there, gnawing away those bones
Drilling through you, poor soul

You can't drive me,
You can't drive me out your head

How low can you go?
Picking up the pieces, while kicking the teeth
How low can you go?
Back in the spread feces, from under your feet?
Under your feet

Hey it's still me here, spitting in your face
Rotting you away without a trace
Hey it's still me here, aching in those bones
Spreading through you, poor soul

Try and shoot me, try and shoot me out your head

How low can you go?
Picking up the pieces, while kicking the teeth
How low can you go?
Back in the spread feces, from under your feet?
Under your feet
