Somehow it found a way, will to see the next day
Through a crack it crawled its way in, said won't ever leave
Heavy these boots of lead, so familiar and fitting well
I don't know to regret or to crave, nothing's ahead, left behind

And I feel it coming
I refuse to let it in, to stay
It's melting the ice away
I feel it coming
I refuse to take its weight, tolerate
To hell with it all, I want to be left alone

Straight through the dear despair, infecting dreams and joy
But there's no reason to smile, it all will sail down the drain
Like a bullet through the brain, a plague that eats alive
Now can't tell piss from wine, so sick of this all

And I feel it coming
I refuse to let it in, to stay
It's melting the ice away
I feel it coming
I refuse to take its weight, tolerate
To hell with it all, I want to be left alone

Some by arriving, some by leaving have carved in their marks here beneath
I will be thriving on this endless grieving, forever dwell in my defeat

Beneath the ice it stays the same
Beneath the ice it stays the same
Beneath the ice it stays the same
