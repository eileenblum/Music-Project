Born into contamination
Where god left a trace of blood 
Children died in deadly dust 
Allah sacrificed countless lives

The prophet has failed
Blood ran over desert plains
God commanded to kill 
Centuries of violence

Desert generation
Betrayed by their god 
Desert revolution
Kill the enemy, hate wants to break free

God's army crossed the seas 
Eagles of steel disturbed the peace 
Blood seeped into the desert sand 
The nasty beast was god's right hand

God is an ally
Of the killing alliance
God has refused
Death waits in the wasteland

Desert generation
Betrayed by their god
Desert revolution
Kill the enemy, hate wants to break free

Allah has failed
The prophets are silent
God commands to kill
Ages of violence
Last retribution, last revolution

Desert generation
Betrayed by their god
Desert revolution
Kill the enemy, hate wants to break free
