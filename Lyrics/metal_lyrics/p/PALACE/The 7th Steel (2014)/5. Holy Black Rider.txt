The world stands at a crossroad
Will mankind survive
Greed dominates the humans
World is completely turned
The truth becomes a lie
The lie becomes the truth
Saints are sinners
Sinners are saints

There is no space for people who are true
Wake up the holy warrior inside of you

Holy black rider
Spread your seed of truth into the world
Holy black rider
Let humanity be more than just a word

All religions have failed
No god has thought wiser
The cross is stained with blood
Children are mistreated
The poor are getting poorer
The rich get more and more
Selfishness is a virus
Bankers are infected

Trust, honesty and loyalty
Remember the true values in your heart

Holy black rider
Spread your seed of truth into the world
Holy black rider
Let humanity be more than just a word

Spark the flame of justice inside of you
Use the magic of the powerful runes

Holy black rider
Spread your seed of truth into the world
Holy black rider
Let humanity be more than just a word
