How many lies do I have to bear every day
For the parasites of leadership I have to pay
You kick humaneness with feet
For all the world to see
Even if you beg for mercy
For all your deeds you'll bleed

Rot in hell
Rot in hell
Perish in hell
Rot in hell

You pay for the mental torture you've done to me
You betrayers pay for all the atrocities
Dreams of bleed and nightmares
Creep into your soul
Hell waits for you
No escape from burning claws

Rot in hell
Rot in hell
Perish in hell
Rot in hell

There will be no warning
When devil's son will take your soul
Your soul is running scared
Into the realm of pain

Rot in hell
Rot in hell
Rot in hell
Rot in hell
Rot in hell
