The battle of gods started thousands of years b.c.
Entire cities were destroyed from a future technology
Messengers of death in flying vimanas machines
Thousands are burnt on the Indian battlefields

Gods of war have returned with a time machine
Ancient gods appear on silver wings

Bloodshed of gods
A never ending game
Bloody rain remains
Bloodshed of gods
Raging fire again
Not for man to tame

Melted pieces of aircrafts fell from the skies
Shot down by Krishna's powerful blazing missiles

Gods of war have returned with a time machine
Ancient gods appear on silver wings

Bloodshed of gods
A never ending game
Bloody rain remains
Bloodshed of gods
Raging fire again
Not for man to tame

Vimanas, a gift from 'those from upon high'
The ancient gods of war have never died

Bloodshed of gods
A never ending game
Bloody rain remains
Bloodshed of gods

Bloodshed of gods
A never ending game
Bloody rain remains
Bloodshed of gods
Raging fire again
Not for man to tame

Bloodshed of gods
