I wake up from a noise of metal and lightning
A knight of steel tells me about my destiny
In mental connection with my metal mates
Brotherhood forever, these chains no one can break

At blue horizon
Thousands appear
A sound of clashing metal and thundersteel

Climb highest mountains, cross seven seas 
I'm on the way to find the metal company 
Cruise all the highways, through muddy fields 
Metal brothers are waiting for me

Guided by the force of metal and rock
I've found metalians who have metal in their blood
Shouting side by side	"metal forever"
It comes together what belongs together

At blue horizon
Thousands appear
A sound of clashing metal and thundersteel

Climb highest mountains, cross seven seas 
I'm on the way to find the metal company 
Cruise all the highways, through muddy fields 
Metal brothers are waiting for me

The metal empire
Will never fall

Climb highest mountains, cross seven seas 
I'm on the way to find the metal company 
Cruise all the highways, through muddy fields 
Metalheads wanna rock to be free

Climb highest mountains, cross seven seas 
I'm on the way to find the metal company 
Cruise all the highways, through muddy fields 
Metal brothers are waiting for me
