Warning, bastards of destruction are raging
Mankind is on the edge
Calling the thunder of Odin
Enslavement of the world must have an end
Tiama, commander of Vril machines
Sends legions of steel to strike back

A new world is dawning
A new breed arises
Teutonic legions arrive
The return of keeper of the violet flame
The ancestors end tyrants reign

Thunderbolts wake up Teutonic hearts
Teutonic hearts beat on and on 
The spirit of occident will rise again 
Teutonic hearts beat on and on

Isais, ruler from the inner world
Prepares to kill the constructors of death
Flying silver Teutonic angels
Are gliding straight to our hearts

A new world is dawning
A new breed arises
Teutonic legions arrive
The return of keeper of the violet flame
The ancestors end tyrants reign

Thunderbolts wake up Teutonic hearts
Teutonic hearts beat on and on 
The spirit of occident will rise again 
Teutonic hearts beat on and on

Thunderbolts, Teutonic hearts
Thunderbolts, Teutonic hearts

Thunderbolts wake up Teutonic hearts
Teutonic hearts beat on and on 
The spirit of occident will rise again 
Teutonic hearts beat on and on
