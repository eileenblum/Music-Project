Is there anybody out there
Who understands this nightmare
In a world where no one takes care 
Of this headless misery everywhere 
Missing love and mistreating
Hungry children and homeless on the streets 
How to escape from this insanity?

No doctorâs medicine cures freaky brains 
How to cure a heart of pain?

Hearts that never filled with love 
Need an injection of affection
To change a heart of stone into a heart of love
Hearts that grow up in hate and pain
Need an injection of affection
To get a chance to feel love again

Who protects the broken and the beaten? 
They close their eyes, these selfish people 
Some weak kids have drugs in their veins

No doctorâs medicine cures freaky brains 
How to cure a heart of pain?

Hearts that never filled with love 
Need an injection of affection
To change a heart of stone into a heart of love
Hearts that grow up in hate and pain
Need an injection of affection
To get a chance to feel love again

Thereâs a hole in the heart 
Where humanity has died
A chance for a brand new start
With all braveness from deep inside 
Who to set free locked feelings
How to set free chained heads 
How to cure a heart of pain

Hearts that never filled with love 
Need an injection of affection
To change a heart of stone into a heart of love
Hearts that grow up in hate and pain
Need an injection of affection
To get a chance to feel love again

Thereâs a hole in the heart
Where humanity has died
A chance for a brand new start
With all braveness from deep inside
