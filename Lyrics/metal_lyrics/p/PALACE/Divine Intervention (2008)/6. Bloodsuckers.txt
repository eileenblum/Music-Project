Once there was a time when the people were glorious and free
Richness and luck should be their destiny
âBig Brotherâsâ crusaders came beyond the seven seas
Looted this land and brought the misery

Were living in a democratic dictatorship
We get controlled and ruled by brainless puppets
These brainless puppets betrayed and sold the land
These brainless puppets give promises and money to the whole world
Thatâs why we are in debt

We pay our debt, bloodsuckers
We pay our debt, bloodsuckers

Who tells the puppets we pay to the world
We pay for the puppets and the âHoly Landâ
These brainless puppets plunder our social securities
We need our money back
We need our money back
You smelly rats thatâs why we are in debt

We pay our debt, bloodsuckers
We pay our debt, bloodsuckers
Thereâs a difference between the past and today

A guilty conscience they talk in our minds
These bloodsuckers make profit by wars and
Crimes these brainless puppets
Henchmen of âBig Brotherâ cheat and lie

Give the country back
Give the freedom back
You smelly rats
That is why we are in debt

We pay our debt, bloodsuckers
We pay our debt, bloodsuckers
