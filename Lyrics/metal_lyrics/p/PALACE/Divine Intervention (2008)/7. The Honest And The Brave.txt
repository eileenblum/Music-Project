You need some courage and strength
To exist in this mad world
Youâre a fighter, a critical writer 
Your reports cover up conspiracies

Face to face
Eye to eye
Day by day
Itâs a challenge in your life

The honest and the brave will survive
They walk the path of justice in a jungle of lies
The brave and the honest donât cry
Even it comes harder on the road of life

Criminal people try to seduce you
But you got a heart of truth
Youâre an angel undercover
Charitable lady like Mother Theresa

Face to face
Eye to eye
Day by day
Itâs a challenge in your life

The honest and the brave will survive
They walk the path of justice in a jungle of lies
The brave and the honest donât cry
Even it comes harder on the road of life

Youâre stronger than the strongest hurricane 
When you get knocked down you get up again

The honest and the brave will survive
They walk the path of justice in a jungle of lies
The brave and the honest donât cry
Even it comes harder on the road of life
