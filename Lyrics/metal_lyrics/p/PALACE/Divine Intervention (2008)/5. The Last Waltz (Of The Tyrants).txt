Baphometâs chalice is filled
With the blood of victims of wars
The last waltz on the bloody floor
Earth angels reaching
Their helping hands into the dark
Who killed the princess of the hearts?

Welcome to the ball of destruction
The orchestra of tyrants starts to play
Luciferâs symphonies of killing
Sounds out of the hall of death
Into the world of flames

Last waltz
The last waltz of the tyrants
Last waltz
The last waltz of the tyrants

Blinded by their greed
Step by step they dance to the edge
Bloodthirsty are the blue-blooded rats
Last rocket firework rising up to the bright moonlight
Judas kisses eleven minutes after midnight
Last hour has come

Welcome to the ball of destruction
The orchestra of tyrants starts to play
Luciferâs symphonies of killing
Sounds out of the hall of death
Into the world of flames

Last waltz
The last waltz of the tyrants
Last waltz
The last waltz of the tyrants

Last waltz, last waltz
Last waltz, last waltz

Last waltz
The last waltz of the tyrants
Last waltz
The last waltz of the tyrants
