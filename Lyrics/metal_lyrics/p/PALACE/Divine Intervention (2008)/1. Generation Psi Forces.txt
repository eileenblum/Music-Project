From the 6th dimension beyond an invisible universe
By the cycle of incarnation the light brigade will be born
Their DNA strings are coded with information of light
This future race brings the changes to human hearts and human minds

On a ray of blue light
They are passing through star gates 
To bring the crystal genes

Indigo child, angry rebel of light
A future race, generation psi forces

They have an inborn truth detector and a new energy
These planet protectors got a warrior personality
To set mankind free from the collective pain
The old cancers of lies covered up by sensitive mind eye

On a ray of blue light
They are passing through star gates
To bring the crystal genes

Indigo child, angry rebel of light
A future race, generation psi forces

On a ray of blue light
They are passing through star gates 
Wise souls will come

Indigo child, angry rebel of light
A future race, generation psi forces

Psi force invasion
Indigo nation
Psi generation
