A big hole has opened the floor 
Lost souls fall into an emptiness 
When blood is gonna spilled
Itâs Satanâs celebration
Thereâs no God, no hope, no love 
No light in this darkness
Itâs the deepest darkness a lost soul 
Has ever seen

These evil creatures in the darkness 
Will feel real pain
Agonizing desperate souls
Will be pulled down to this edge
There are thousands of souls in hell 
That scream and groan of pain
They implore for pardon again and again

Divine, divine intervention will come 
Divine, divine intervention for everyone

Satan tries to seduce every soul 
These demons are suicide souls 
Angels come down to darkness 
To bring mercy and forgiveness
Passing through the arms of Satan 
Reaching for the hands of god
The link to hell must be cut

Divine, divine intervention will come 
Divine, divine intervention, intervention 
Divine, divine intervention will come 
Divine, divine intervention, intervention

Lost souls creep out of dark holes 
God fights for every soul
Divine intervention
