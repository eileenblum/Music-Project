My soul leaves my body in agony 
Life is running before my eyes
Scenes from my past come back to me
I float over my body and look down

I come to an unearthly world
A feeling of peace and joy
A bright light comes closer and closer 
Wonderful sounds going around

What expects me on the other side when I die?
Will I stay for a while in this beautiful light when I die?

What expects me on the other side when I die?
Will I stay for a while in this beautiful light when I die?

In a tunnel I glide into this bright light
A feeling of cosmic unity
I come to the point of no return 
Reanimation brings me back

What expects me on the other side when I die?
Will I stay for a while in this beautiful light when I die?
