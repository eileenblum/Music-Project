When I was a young boy 
An angel came in the night
He told me incredible stories 
About secret CIA files
He told me the truth
Alien species coming soon

Faster than laser bullets 
They appear and disappear 
Peaceful they are here

Here come the metal angels
The metal angels from far away out of space
Here come the metal angels
The metal angels to watch the human race

He told me about âblack projectsâ
From human constructed space ships 
Creators of the crop circles
Are aliens with a higher intelligence

Faster than laser bullets 
They appear and disappear 
Peaceful they are here

Here come the metal angels
The metal angels from far away out of space
Here come the metal angels
The metal angels to watch the human race

They are godlike beings 
From the realm of spirits

Peaceful they are here 
To teach the cosmic laws

Here come the metal angels
The metal angels from far away out of space
Here come the metal angels
The metal angels to watch the human race
