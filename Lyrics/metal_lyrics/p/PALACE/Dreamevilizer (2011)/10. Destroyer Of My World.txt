Murder, terror, violence, hate and destruction
Thatâs your world construction
My rage and hate grow day by day
You destroy my world all the way
My own world is built on peace
Justice, truth and trust

Persecution, retribution
For those who destroy my world
Best solutions, execution
Who enters my world

Pain, death, greed, injustice, war and genocide
Ghost of fear creeping through the cities
Iâll burn down your world of lied
You are the real enemies
My own world is built on peace
Justice, truth and trust

Persecution, retribution
For those who destroy my world
Best solutions, execution
Who enters my world

I spit blood into your face
You destroyer
You are the lowest form of life

Persecution, retribution
For those who destroy my world
Best solutions, execution
Who enters my world
