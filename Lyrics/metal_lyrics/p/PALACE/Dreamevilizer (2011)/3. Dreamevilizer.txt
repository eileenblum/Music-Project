It seems Iâm trapped in a world
Ruled by idiots and fools
Humanity gets on the lose
Behind the curtain
Youâre the bastards in Satanâs service
To create the new world order

Death, pain, fear appear in your dreams

Dreamevilizer
Iâm your nightmare evilizer
Dreamevilizer
Iâm your evil plan analyzer

Your cowardice and weakness
Is my entry to your soul
When I come from the heavenly world
Battles stars between the underworld
And the light brigade
The reign of terror must end

Iâll burn your hate out of your soul

Dreamevilizer
Iâm your nightmare evilizer
Dreamevilizer
Iâm your evil plan analyzer

Without warning I appear
Smell your sweat of fear

Iâm not afraid of you
Light is a heavenâs tool

Dreamevilizer
Iâm your nightmare evilizer
Dreamevilizer
Iâm your evil plan analyzer
