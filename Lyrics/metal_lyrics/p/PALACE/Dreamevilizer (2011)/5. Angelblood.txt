Like a stray cat I walk along the shore
World has changed
Things are not they were before
Evil voices in my head
A protecting arch angel stands
Behind my back
Iâm scared, Iâm not prepared
Damned, what happens to me?

Angelblood in my veins
Devildust made of my sins
Angelblood cleans my brain
Devildust gets me insane

Something unseen touches my skin
In my mindâs eye I see a thousand sins
I change between good and bad
I feel the greed, fallen angel on the attack
Am I born to know who I am?
Damned, Iâm confused what is real

Angelblood in my veins
Devildust made of my sins
Angelblood cleans my brain
Devildust gets me insane

Thereâs no escape from this nightmare and insanity
My soul is possessed of two entities

Angelblood in my veins
Devildust made of my sins
Angelblood cleans my brain
Devildust gets me insane
