On an army simulator
Blood young boys learn to kill
Killing drones to hire
They are the first under fire
Jeans and shirts swapped for a gun
And a camouflage uniform
The desert is now their new playground
Shoot to thrill
Ready to kill

The architects of war send killing drones
Just medals and scars for killing drones
Body parts will burn of killing drones
There is no return, killing drones

For their country bleed to death
Wounded to take a last breath
Brainwashed boys are on the attack
In body bags they come back
They send them to the war to be slain
One way ticket to hell
The devilâs bombs have an oily smell
Pull the trigger
Legally killers

The architects of war send killing drones
Just medals and scars for killing drones
Body parts will burn of killing drones
There is no return, killing drones

Jeans and shirts swapped for a gun
And a bloody uniform
Sand of desert colored red
