I slide through the ages to the edge of human history
Arrive in a world of electronic control and tyrannies
Elf-waves reach my brain to get me insane
On the planet of slaves, planet of slaves

Hohohohoâ¦
Human race get off your knees
We are the ones they fear

A shadow elite created by battalion of slaves
Numbered prisoners in an unseen electronic cage
Robbed of feeling, robbed of thoughts
Brainwaves get programmed on the planet of slaves, planet of slaves

Hohohohoâ¦
Human race get off your knees
We are the ones they fear

Stand up and break the invisible chains
Liberty or death
Technology of control will fail
A free world is waiting for you
Mankind, get off your knees

Hohohohoâ¦
Human race get off your knees
We are the ones they fear
