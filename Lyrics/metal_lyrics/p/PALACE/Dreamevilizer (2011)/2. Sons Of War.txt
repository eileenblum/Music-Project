Carried on the wings of destruction
Sons of war cruise through the times
Millions of crusaders still marching
Not any war brought peace
Guns are melting to toys
Hate change to love in a world of war
Flames and bombs to dust

Sons of war are in anger
Sons of war are in anger
No war in sight
Sons of war are in anger
White knights quit fights
Sons of war

Sons of war are bringers of misery
The black gold is their lord
All warriors of God are insane
Bloodshed in the name of god
Godâs voice is silenced
Hate change to love in a world of war
Flames and bombs to dust

Sons of war are in anger
Sons of war are in anger
No war in sight
Sons of war are in anger
White knights quit fights
Sons of war

Sons of war are in anger and rage
Sons of war are in anger
