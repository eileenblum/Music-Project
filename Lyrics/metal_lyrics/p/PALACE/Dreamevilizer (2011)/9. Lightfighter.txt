I have visions in the darkness
Earthquakes shake me down
Caused by deadly frequencies
Were sent from the orbit to the ground
Ascending from a world of destruction
Created by a swarm of light beings
He got the key to unlock a new reality

Lightrider, lightfighter
The battle has just begun
Lightrider, lightfighter
Unleash the power of thousand suns

White bolt of lightning out of nowhere
Dark souls on the final run
A hole in the sky by a magnetic storm
A fallout of seed of light
Ascending from a hellish red horizon
Created by a swarm of light beings
He got the key to unlock a new reality

Lightrider, lightfighter
The battle has just begun
Lightrider, lightfighter
Unleash the power of thousand suns

The dark age of wars comes to an end
Mankind, receiver of the light
Masters of death still hold their blades
Lightfighter will arise again
Ascending from a hellish red horizon
Created by a swarm of light beings
He got the key to unlock a new reality
