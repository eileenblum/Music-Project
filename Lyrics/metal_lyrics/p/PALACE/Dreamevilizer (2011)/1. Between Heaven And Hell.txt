Follow me through the night
All hearts completely dark
Iâm confused to decide
Feel the pain of frozen blood
Angel of light be my guide
Pull me up to your kingdom of light
Prince of the kingdom of the night
Messenger of death and pain
Bringer of evil and lies
World frozen in the eternal peace

Between heaven and hell
War by shadow and light
Between heaven and hell

Brute of hell enslaves the world
Brute of hell terrorize the world
Satanâs son takes Godâs throne
Holy words with bloody tongue
Luciferâs number is decoded
System of hell will explode
Warrior of light be my guide
Your heavenly sword will save my life

Between heaven and hell
War by shadow and light
Between heaven and hell

Everlasting fire
Satanâs empire
Between heaven and hell
Hell brigade will be blinded by the sun
Satanâs last day has come
