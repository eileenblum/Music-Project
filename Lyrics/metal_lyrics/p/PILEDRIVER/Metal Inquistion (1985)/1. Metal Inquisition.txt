We're the metal inquisition, we've come to search you out
Once you to see things our way, you won't have any doubt
You better wear some leather, you better wear some chains
Don't try to resist us, it'll only bring you pain

We'll hunt you down like animals, we're going to have a chase
We'll beat you till you're senseless, we'll never leave a trace
We'll round you up for trial, we'll bust you on the spot
We'll treat you all like criminals, you'll be a sorry lot

And if you're not a metal head you might as well be dead
We're the metal inquisition... We sentence you to death... by guillotine!

We'll take you to our leaders, we'll take you to our court
Arrest you in the name of hell and play a deadly sport
And if we find you guilty, your punishment is death
You better look the other way, you'd better hold your breath

So if you're in a disco or in a country bar
You better get the hell out, we know who you are
You better get some metal and play it really loud
You have the chance to join us, the mighty and the proud

But if we catch you punking, you know the penalty
We'll come down with a vengeance, we'll never set you free
We're the metal inquisition, we're not too hard to find
Don't get any closer, we might just blow your mind
