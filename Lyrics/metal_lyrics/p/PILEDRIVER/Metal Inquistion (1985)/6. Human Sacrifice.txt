I'm feelin' down 'n' dirty, feelin' mean
Lost and tired and wasted, a sick machine
Been partying for days, lost my mind can't remember my own name, lost all
time

I smell like a dead animal's rotten guts
Think that I've been to hell and back, kicked in the nuts
I'm always very angry, always tense my breath smells like rancid excrement

I feel like a human sacrifice I feel like, well, like I'm gonna puke!

I'm sick and I'm convulsing in my bed a filthy, sweaty, altar for the dead
I have dreams all night, dreams of death
Offers from the devil burning up my flesh

Feeling paranoia, something's there!
It's crawling through my veins, and through my hair
It's trying to kill me slowly with lots of pain
It's trying to destroy me, it's in my brain!

My head feels like it's breaking, sliced in half
No-one wants to help me, ha ha, how they all laugh
This deadly thing is spreading, is there no cure
Just can't leave me here to rot and die in a sewer!
