Hell on fire, lust, desire
The devil wants to stick you, yeah, the devil wants to lick you
Wants your body, he wants your spirit
He comes to you at night, he wants to take a bite!

Naked, twisting, bodies sweating
You can't escape his hunger, screams like thunder
Prince of Darkness, Prince of Evil
Spread your legs and scream, no this is not a dream!

Sex with satan, excommunication

Degredation, humiliation, thrusting, shoving, animals humping
Lusting loudly, snorting, panting
He's like a dog in heat, you're just another piece of meat

Cursed hellhound, craving demon
He fills you with pain,&amp; now you're bloody and stained
Hurt and beaten, ohhh, shamed and weakened
He will possess you, he will molest you
