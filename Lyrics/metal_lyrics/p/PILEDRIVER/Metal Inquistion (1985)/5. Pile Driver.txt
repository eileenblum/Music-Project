I'm on the road, I'm on the run pile drivin' every day
When I'm in town you'll scream and shout cause I'm gonna blow you away,
yeah!

Who Am I? you ask yourself I'm a dirty rotten son of a bitch!
I just want to rule your mind... but first everybody get pissed!

They call me - the pile driver, the pile driver
They want me - the pile driver, the pile driver
I am the exalted, the one and only pile driver, pile driver

You're on my list, you're next in line get ready for a deadly shock!
Your eyes will burn, your brain explodes get ready for some metal rock!
Once you start it's like a drug I know it'll drive you insane
It'll knock you down and fill you up drilling holes right into your brain!

I'll take you on an endless ride you'll never ever want it to the end
Now I'm your God and I'm your Lord but I'll let you call me your friend
