I'm the prince of fire, debauchery and waste
Swirling whirling terror, the twisted mess of haste
I delight in great destruction, desolation and corruption
I rejoice in sweet confusion, and I love catastrophe

[SUBCHORUS]
A BLACKSTORM FROM THE EAST
I'M ONE WITH THE BEAST
LORD OF ALL CONFUSION
KING OF CALAMITY

[CHORUS]
I'M CHAOS... CHAOS...
LAW AND ORDER I HATE
CHAOS... CHAOS...
LAW AND ORDER I HATE

Anarchy in power and politics I taste
The orderly and prosperous I crush and I erase
When things are going too well, so organised so well
I love to stick my foot in, and make them go to hell

[SUBCHORUS]
[CHORUS]
[SOLO]
[SUBCHORUS]
[CHORUS 4X]
