Yes, the flowers of evil always taste so sweet
as they shiver and cry on the vine
As their deadly poisons multiply
On the flesh of the living they dine

A perfume scent that's sickly sweet
entices you into the brine
and a stranglehold puts the bite on you
and drinks all your blood like wine

[CHORUS1]
THE FLOWERS OF EVIL ARE SPREADING AND SPREADING
THE POISON IS CHOKING, THE VENOM IS DEATH

They were planted in the ancient days by the wizard of Calsyria
and they've taken root in every place
defiling the earth with their blight
A seed of horror, a petal of death
A garden on bloom with decay
A place of beauty and blind deceit
an orchard of Death's disarray

[CHORUS2]
THE FLOWERS OF EVIL ARE SPREADING AND SPREADING
THE POISON IS CHOKING, THE VENOM IS DEATH
BEWARE OF THE NIGHTSHADE, THE ROSES, THE EVIL
AN ANGELIC SETTING OF CARNAGE SO BESTIAL

[SOLO]

Don't smell the flowers...
Beware the flowers...
[2X]

[CHORUS2]
