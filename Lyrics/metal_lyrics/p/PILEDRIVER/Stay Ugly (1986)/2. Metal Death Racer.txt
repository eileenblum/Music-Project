Roaring down the highway, feeling mighty mean
burning sweaty leather, chrome and gasoline
My car is the messiah, a warrior on wheels
The engine whining higher, hear the tires squeal

[CHORUS]
I... RACE TO THE DEATH
A... WARHEAD ON WHEELS
I... RACE TO THE DEATH
A... WARHEAD ON WHEELS
[repeat]

No-one here can match me, I'm an ultrasonic scream
devouring my enemies, this ain't no fucking dream
sweet sixteen beside me with her young &amp; sexy glow
when she goes down on me, I let my octane blow!

[CHORUS]

[1ST VERSE]

[CHORUS]
I... LEAVE A STRETCH ON YOUR LIFE
YEAH... COMPLETE OVERDRIVE
...COMPLETE OVERDRIVE
...COMPLETE OVERDRIVE
YEAH!
