Cursed by the priests, torn, twisted and beat
sentenced to die, by the sorceress, her evil eye
God of the Furnace, I call thy name
Please deliver me from the serpent
the serpent of pain

[CHORUS]
THE FIRE GOD... THE FIRE GOD
BURN ALL THE SINNERS IN MY WAY

Rise up devour, an inferno of ultimate power
God of Destruction, consume them with your eruption
Enflame the sorceress, the priests of evil who bind me
Singe them, burn them, destroy them
Please, please deliver me...
With holy fire... the golden pyre

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

[END CHORUS]
THE FIRE GOD... THE FIRE GOD
I CALL THY NAME, CONSUME MY PAIN
BURN ALL THE SINNERS BEYOND DEATH
BEYOND DEATH
