Do not open the gate of the abyss unless you have performed the correct
sacrifice, and named the sacred hour, for if all the abyss break forth upon
the earth, the dead rise to meet the living. For it is written, "I will call
the dead to rise and devour the living, I will give to the dead power
of the living, that they may outnumber the living. I am... the Lord of
Abominations...
