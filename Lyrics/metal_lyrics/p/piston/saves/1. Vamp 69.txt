Strange new land......
All filled with sand......
I change my shoes for nothing.....
New longley.....
The endless rain......
I'll turn this town to nothing

[Chorus:]
Take me out
Ferry bound
I'm a vampire in stauton island.....

Just like god
I'm in control.....
I dress in life for nothing.....
Give futally
A perfect place
A mirror make me a puppet

[Chorus x2]

WONT YOU TRUST ME!!!

[Chorus]

CANT YOU TRUST ME!!!
