And on saga goes
I cant change the end you know
Things that move in circles rarely die
I cant live another joke
I cant be the holdly ghost

[Chorus:]
Nothing brings me down more than life.............
Nothing gets me down more than life..........

Broke and cold alone
I admit to nothing slow
The hell inside your temples never hides
I'm a brave and so is snow
This poison never goes

[Chorus]

On the inside.......
On the outside.........

Life............

[Chorus till fade]
