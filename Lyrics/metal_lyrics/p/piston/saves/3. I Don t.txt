Open your ears and your eyes
I'm suprised, I'm suprised, I'm suprised
The opening lines in my life
Fail to smile, fail to smile, fail to smile
I close all accounts out tonight
Every time, every time, every time

I don't care....

[Chorus:]
I don't smile anymore!!
I don't smile anymore!!
I'm to shy..... to smile.....

Changing the opening the lines
Not suprised, not suprised, not suprised
Braking the earth in my mind
Closing time, closing time, closing time
The change in the bowler is fine
So alive, so alive, so alive

I don't care....

[Chorus]

Oh......
Oh......
Change this smile

[Chorus]

To smile to shy...
To smile to shy...
To smile to shy...
To smile to shy...
To smile to shy...
To smile to shy...
To smile to shy...
To smile to shy...

I don't change!
