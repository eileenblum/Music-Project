Stick with me, stick with me,

await the sign, await the sign dear
Hold on to me, stand by me please,

await the sign that i will send to you
Love was warm and great love could fill my heart
then my life was saved loving you
trusting was the deal the dream was almost real
but love drifted away unfaithful lies

Who needs love? Who needs hugs? Who needs drugs? I am hurt.
Don't need love Don't need hugs Don't need drugs I am Hurt.
Love is hard and sharp love has killed my heart
The world is a let down well! tough shit
Love is cruel and strange love can turn to hate
Hate is growing here there and everywhere

Who needs love? Who needs hugs? Who needs drugs? I am hurt.
Don't need love Don't need hugs Don't need drugs I am Hurt.
