I can't understand the clocks of the haunted mansion hall
The hands are showing nothing, the garden seems to break through the windows!

I'm trapped in this spot beyond doom!
This hell of mine!
It's been unchanging along time!
The garden grows!

My body is cold and light like fog, my mind is out of time
I'm the enchanted prisoner, I'm enslaved by the unshaken grave!

I'm trapped in this spot beyond doom!
This hell of mine!
It's been unchanging along time!
The garden sings.
The eternal hug of the grey flesh, the never ending cry
I can't see the light above, I can't free myself from the damned grave!

I'm trapped in this spot beyond doom!
This hell of mine!
It's been unchanging along time!
The garden remains!
