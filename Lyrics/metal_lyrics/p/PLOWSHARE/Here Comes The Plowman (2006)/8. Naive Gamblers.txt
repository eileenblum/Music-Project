Think about all you win with your life stained with sin
You say oh, it's only a game, but you don't know it makes you insane
Naive Gamblers

With the cards, with the dice will you find paradise?
Betting hard, gambling ever, try to seem like you're so clever
Roll the dice
Do you see what your life's gonna be?
Will I ever see you living free?
Yes I know, all your friends now they're gone
It's your fault, that you're a naive gambler at all

Must take care when you choose, doesn't matter if you loose
ÂCause the debt is so high that you're chased day and night
Watch out for the fucking tricks!
Do you see what your life's gonna be?
Will I ever see you living free?
Yes I know, all your friends now they're gone
It's your fault, that you're a naive gambler at all
