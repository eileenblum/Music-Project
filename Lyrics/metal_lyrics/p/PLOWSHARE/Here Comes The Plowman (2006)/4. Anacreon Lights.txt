At the end of the galaxy is the only destination
For twenty thousand families who made up the first foundation
Salvor Hardin belonged to the Terminus first generation
Sometimes when he was young he travelled around the nearby systems

And once he saw: Anacreon lights
But those where different times, the second crisis threatened
The four kingdoms were growing... burning desires of expansion
The council soon was gathered in to discuss the best solution
The contacts were informed and Hardin left to fly

With the aim to see: Anacreon Lights
Anacreon stood still for new king's crowning ceremony
Salvor Hardin was caught, prisoner of regent's conspiracy
The ships were flying to Terminus, but Hardin ruled the situation
Because attacking the foundation would be the biggest sacrilege
Population cheered: Anacreon Falls
