Lost forever in the darkness trapped beyond the sense of time
Doesn't remember why he's enclosed there, he only knows he's on his own
Tryin' to find the way to escape, drifting inside, drifting alone
How many soldiers have tried to escape The underhall levels, tunnels of the damned.
Hey Mike hey Mike please take me to the other side
Hurry up don't waste your time the evil worms are leaving the pipes
Hey Mike hey Mike please take me to the other side
Lieutenant of the green team and Robert Swain have already seen the eternal white

Perpetual night in the future world, the system is fallen the values are lost
The imperial ruins now behold the stars the concrete blocks squander their past
Now this place reminds us all of the intrinsic madness of the human soul
Ghostly shadows in the air they don't know they're already dead
Hey Mike hey Mike please take me to the other side
Hurry up don't waste your time the evil worms are leaving the pipes
Hey Mike hey Mike please take me to the other side
Lieutenant of the green team and Robert Swain have already seen the eternal white
