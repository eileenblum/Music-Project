"And I swear to you that their pain will be my joy"

It's time to win, the inner hate's the only fuel
to crush those bastards, the only aim
everything's planned now I'm aware and confident
that all my enemies are losers

The height of revenge season's here
scorn against the mocking crap
I shall walk over their meaningless minds
cause all my enemies are losers
