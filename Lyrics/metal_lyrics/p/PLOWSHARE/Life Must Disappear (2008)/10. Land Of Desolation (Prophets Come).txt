Beware of my deadly sting, I am the real thing
You are the affected ones, your pain will raise at once

I finally know who I am... as I see the cities burning down
When anarchy grips each town... I enforce the new laws
I am the visionary of the oncoming future
I am the knowledgeable one

New age will come and prevail, you die! It's heads or tails
Duty must be carried out, refugees will all rush out

I spread the speech of fear, suffering and hell are near
look for your hiding places, cover your frightened faces

I finally know who I am... as I see the cities burning down
I am the heir of fate and I bring the reign of hate
I walk the streets in ruins warning each living being
When anarchy grips each town... I enforce the new laws
