I still remember an ancient story which my granpa use to tell
All about our ancestors, the old men from the past
He knew the existence of a place, surely left and doomed
Its the land of desolation, lost on the other side

In the land of desolation reigns the emptiness
Vast expanses without life, it's the deadly crust
There are buildings, bones and scrap all spread around
Ghostly voices filled with gloom whisper from the soil

"Hey, being free is all we want to be"

The immobile clouds of the impassive skies quietly watch the zone
Many dead dreams lay down there, a wasteland in pale blue
Everything that men could do finished suddenly
Ghostly voices filled with gloom whisper from the soil

"Hey, being free is all we want to be"
