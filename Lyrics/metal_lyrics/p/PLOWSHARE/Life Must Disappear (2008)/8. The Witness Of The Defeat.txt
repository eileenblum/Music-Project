Roaming alone just on your own ... What have you seen?
Lost on the way, your mind blows away ... What have you seen J pilgrim?

- I am the witness of the defeat
J Pilgrim...
- I am the watcher of this faded world

Walking ahead over the dead ... What have you seen?
Watching the skies have just turned to red ... What have you seen J pilgrim?

- I've seen the kings adoring the beast
J Pilgrim...
- All the men, drowned in misery

Roaming alone just on your own ...
Lost on the way, your mind blows away ...

J Pilgrim...
- I am the witness of the defeat
J Pilgrim...
- I am the watcher of this faded world

J Pilgrim...
- I am the witness of the defeat
J Pilgrim...
- All the men drowned in misery
