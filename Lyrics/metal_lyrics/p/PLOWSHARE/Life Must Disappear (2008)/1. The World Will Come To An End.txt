I've seen in you some signs of life and death...
Slave!! You are the carrier of the past
The world! The inner, the outside, the abyss.

There will be no more greetings... there will be no more goodbyes.

The trip to nowhere, the wise one, the watcher, the prophet:
The witness of the defeat walks alone,
he knows when the world will come to an end.
