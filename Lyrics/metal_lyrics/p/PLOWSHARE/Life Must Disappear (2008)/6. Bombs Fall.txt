Bombs fall! [x2]

Bombs are falling like diarrhea in a public toilet: feel god's rear

I see the light of a million corpses burning warm in collective graves
Troops of doom are bringing us the reprimand it's god's command

Pregnant moms are giving birth to burst sons: their hope is dead

I see the light of a million corpses burning warm in collective graves
Troops of doom are bringing us the reprimand it's god's command

Bombs fall! [x2]

Children's fate being mutilated, orphan legs seeking owner's trunk
Owner's trunk, that doesn't belong to a soldier or a sergeant of the armies of the world
In fact the owner is a victim: noisy bombs dig yards of tombs

Dead hope [x2]

I see the light of a million corpses burning warm in collective graves
Troops of doom are bringing us the reprimand it's god's command

Bombs fall!
