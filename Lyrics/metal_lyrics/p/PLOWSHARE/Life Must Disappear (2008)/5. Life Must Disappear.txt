Take a pew my beloved friend, you can't miss the show
I've reserved us the best seats, apocalypse begins now!

the prophets spoke the speech of fear so life must disappear
The kids are moaning in their own tears but life must disappear

As I saw it in my dreams the terror shakes the Earth
World War III will spread the pain, humans burn to death

Atomic missiles will cross the sky surface'll be plowed and dry
the Human experience has totally failed extinction has been mailed

The growing pain of sorrow distorts the will of tomorrow
The living end lies in wait, to become carrion is our fate

The glimpsing of the reign of chaos, the nightfall of the modern values
My troopers shall Obey and follow, the meaning of mine is hollow

Now the visions fill my eyes, twilight smoky skies
The only proof of human life, buildings, ruins and ash

The prophets spoke the speech of fear so life must disappear
The kids are moaning in their own tears but life must disappear

Atomic missiles will cross the sky surface'll be plowed and dry
The Human experience has totally failed extinction has been mailed

The bombers are flying over head [x2]
