"You are the strongest ones, the guardians of the basis of faith you must defend the values of holy writings, and die in the name of God"

You are the bravest ones to fight against the unbelievers
the outcome of this war depends on you all

Those were the streets of horror, that was the hellish smoke
where confusion broke us down

I will never be free, I will never find out
the young man I was back when I had no guilt

Now I can see what I did... those targets were only children
I can still see them staring at me... God, where are you now?

...where's my reward for being a model believer?
...will you come and take me out of the box?

God, where are you now?

The guardians of the basis of faith

you must die in the name of God

...where's my reward for being a model believer?
