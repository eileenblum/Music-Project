Futile deaths in trenches the only thing I can see
Indifference and useless thoughts returning to me
No more kind donations can prolong the agony
No more mutilations: meet the last tragedy!
Heavy weapons spit around a hard rain of lead
Can see a million bullets trailing some human heads
Feel the hate of people against each other again
Welcome to dump planet, meet the madness domain!

Dead world

I can see the garbage rivers flooding the land
No one takes the blame, no one has dirt on their hands
No more kind donations can prolong the agony
No more mutilations: meet the last tragedy!

Dead world

Swindled, stolen, cheated, plundered, collapsed world
You can't trust your neighbour you can't flaunt your own soul
Feel the hate of people against each other again
Welcome to dump planet, meet the madness domain!

Dead world [x2]
