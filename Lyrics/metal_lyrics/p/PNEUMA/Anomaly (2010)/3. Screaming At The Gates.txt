Vaguing instincts
Disappearing edges
Tore a mask and settled foor you
Stood up woke up
Felt it growing in numbers
Sought to reinstall this line of thought
Try residing in constant linings torn apart from me
weÂ´re deciding (who should pay for you)
Try and cope with losing Â faith in you
Deciding what to do, ending me in you
These words have wrote their final passions
Ended in disaster, hoped youÂ´d pull me through
Blinded, broke and mended
Sought to reinstall this line of thought
Try residing in constant linings torn apart from me
weÂ´re deciding (who should pay for you)
Try and cope with losing faith in you
Deciding what to do, ending me in you
In time, will the answers crumble down?
Time that takes is tow upon our faith
CanÂ´t be afraid of things that are left unsaid
Chose to screm lively at the gates
Found words to dissipate
All anger in me is meant not to hate
A reminder of what i must do
Not trusting in hypocrites like you
Trusting you; all thatÂ´s left to do
In me I see more than I ever could
Now the time has come to slash all ends
Set loose to chains, tied to you
