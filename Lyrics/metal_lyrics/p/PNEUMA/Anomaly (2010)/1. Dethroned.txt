Fighting your way through the mazes of torment
Knowing youÂ´ll never be seen as an asset
So you try to egotiate a truce with your equals
But you still se the fire that burns in their eyes
You see the lies!

Before you kneel, take time to look away
Youl'll see those stolen lives
The crime today is growing day by day
Youll see your stolen mind

Finding your way is just fighting your freedom
Igniting the ways of the tranquil deceiver
So you trym to negotiate a truce with yourr equals
Destined to play in the minds of the weaker
You sense the lies!

Before you kneel, take time to look away
Youl'll see those stolen lives
The crime today is growing day by day
Youll see your stolen mind

Destroy your fright
Stand tall and fight
The hate they feel
Is what they fear

Dethrone their rights
Stand tall and fight
The hate they feel
Is what they fear
Make them feel cold steel

Before you kneel, take time to look away
Youl'll see those stolen lives
The crime today is growing day by day
Youll see your stolen mind

All that we see
Is but a dream
All that we seek
Iron clad steel screen

All that we see
Is but a dream
All that we seek
Iron clad steel screen
