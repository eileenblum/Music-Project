this is a dent in the road
this is a turn of events
changing the cage that we own
int a safety net

permission to fill the void
is granted within
I urge you to search your soul
follow your sins

We pay, we owe, we own
We seek, we wish to know
We pay, we owe, spread fear
We seek, we wish, to know

rinse now the death off your scent
turn and rise in contempt
there is no conscience to fill
tend to attin the silent ways

We pay, we owe, we own
We seek, we wish to know
We pay, we owe, spread fear
We seek, we wish, to know

Create light in the sky
Prepare those to feel life
Compare and rectify
This is the time to analyze

Time to disappear, to become clear
is wraping past my mind
Mind of my own
has a way of taking control
it takes control
