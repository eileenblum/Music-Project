I never tried to decoratre
Only stood and watch it break
Covered stories with detail
Come up with something worth their while

Recurrent daydream
visions of the past
No escaping
No turning back

I watch you as you fade
ThereÂ´s nothng left usaid
ItÂ´s coming to an end
ItÂ´s wrong i canÂ´t deny

Now i can find myself again
Now i can find...

Your sun is dark today
The crod begins to gaze
The one thing they adore
The end of an era the age of nevermore

Time to face the wheel
It spins and never ends
This time no appeal
Will save you from yourself

Repent, repent save yourself
see your world is at an end
