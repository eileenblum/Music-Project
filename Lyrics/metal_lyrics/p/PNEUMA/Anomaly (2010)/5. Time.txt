Inject the venom in me
ItÂ´s more than you can see
These practices become
The mess weÂ´ve left undone

IÂ´ve trapped a life in me
Transformed to melody
Transmission form the source
Has shifted main course

Time is wraping past my mind
ItÂ´s changing everything alive in time
I have no time to choosse my crime
Time moves on leaving me behind in time

Estranged is how i feel
Beneath the core
Construct the edge in me
Leave me whole
Dedicate this one to you
The one inside
The everlasting
Of my life

Time is wraping past my mind
ItÂ´s changing everything alive in time
I have no time to choosse my crime
Time moves on leaving me behind in time

The past stll lives in me
It shackes me everyday
No time to save the way
My mind has been reread
By stupid fucks with heads
No time to save the way
No time to save, no time today

Trying to stand by
As time passes by
