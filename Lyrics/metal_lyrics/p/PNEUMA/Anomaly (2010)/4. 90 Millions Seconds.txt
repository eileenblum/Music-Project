A test, a trial, your reason to begin
A test that grow through the innocence in me
You became everything preordained
Pitiful waste and utter-less shame
Now i show you just what you are
This shows you just who you are
Betrayal has no price
No severance to suffice
Tried to redirect
Realized too late
90 million seconds of my life you had to take
You equal waste...
Remade, reborn, our mindset taking form
Presently absent from your pathetic form
So glad you went away
Proud that you portray
The negative effects of being wasted away
Now i show just what you are
This shows you just who you are
Betryal has no price
No severance to suffice
Tried to redirect
Realized too late
90 million seconds of my life you had to take
You equal waste...
Since you insist on trying
IÂ´ll show them what youÂ´re hiding
Too bad you think youÂ´re crucial
The truth is much more brutal
Take heed to waht i'm saying
My words are not for playing
So sad you think you're crucial
The fate of waste is brutal
If you still feel like trying
Remember i'm not hiding
No faint or small time loser
Will take the dream I'd die for
Stop lying; stop pretending you're worth my time
I'll take you home and show you the best of times
Once, twice, thrice
Taste the vice
Take advice
Betryal has non price
No severance to suffice
Tried to redirect
Realized too late
90 million seconds of my life you had to take
You equal waste...
