Coming from the sky like an everglade
Turning from the path we chose to hate
Coming from within like a vital organ
Pushing forth like a tidal wave

Injuries subdued to crime nations
Property of theyr illegal states
Progress has become a cornerstone
For ignorance to hide and be reused

Their crime is weakend sorrow
The dance of denial

Dawn is coming like a twelve-year strike
Echoing the halls of our twelve-month sons
Progress has become a cornerstone
For ignorance to hide and be reused

Their crime is weakend sorrow
The dance of denial
You present is hollow
Your future will follow

Paving the way for thos that must pay
Paving the way for thos that must pay
Paving the way for thos that must pay
Paving the way for thos that must pay

THunder sounds from the horizon
Be prepared for waves of laughter
If common wealth is meant to follow
Be prepared for wave of laughter

One strike is all that's left today
One decision to make
Cut down all inviting hands
Destroy their precious commands

Their crime is weakend sorrow
The dance of denial
You present is hollow
Your future will follow
It will follow!
