Inspired by convictions
Touched by faithÂ´s relentless hand
Governed by decisions
Princu0ples that will transcend

A taste of present illusion
Is washed out Â with ast and pendind themes
Present moon of vacuum
Washing out our hopes and dreams

Never knew what it meant to fade
Always trusted in thi light
Not once did i question reason
Now i can find myself again

The truce is now dismissed
No more lies affecting me
I will noth chase the myth
Destroy existing evidence

Gave myself the time
Time that took itÂ´s toll upon my faith
Nothing left unsaid
Just a whisper and i was raised again

Never knew what it meant to fade
Always trusted in thi light
Not once did i question reason
Now i can find myself again
