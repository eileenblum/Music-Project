Never good things to say
Smile on your face
Lessons all around you
High on your shame

How can you save me
From a bad fall
All of the hardships
Are taking its toll
Taking it's fucking toll

Think about what you say
Smile on your face
Whoever walks around you
I'll always say

How can you save me
From a bad fall
All of the hardships
Are taking its toll

How can you save me
From a bad fall
All of the hardships
Are taking its toll
Taking it's fucking toll

Taking it's toll [X3]

How can you save me
From a bad fall
All of the hardships
Are taking its toll

Taking it's toll [X6]
