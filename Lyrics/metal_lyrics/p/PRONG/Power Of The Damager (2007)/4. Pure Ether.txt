This is it, this is what I've found
This is the final statement
The one that's always bound
It's all predestined by forces so unknown
Watching your every move behind a curtained wall

At one point I thought I had control
Like an idiot I listened to my thoughts
I got caught, had to lose it all
Superficial things, taken for truths
What's behind it all?

This is it, this is what I've found
This is the final statement
The one that's always bound

What can't I see? Can I believe?

I was brought, brought into it all
Like an idiot I listened to my thoughts

What can't I see? (pure ether)
Can I believe? (guaranteed to blow your mind) [X2]

Can I believe? [X3]

Pure ether guaranteed to blow your mind
Pure ether all your deeds controlled up high
All your deeds controlled up high
Channeled by immortal minds
All your deeds controlled up high
Channeled by immortal minds

This is it, this is what I've found
Inferior to the other kind
Break on through the other side
Inferior to the other kind
Break on through the other side
Watching your every move
Forces on the other side
Watching your every move
Forces on the other side
This is it....this is what I've found
