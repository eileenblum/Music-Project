Subconsciously
Constant conscious effort
Reminding me
Why do I forget this?

Inside of me
Master has a message,
All of the clutter in heads of another
Something left behind
Lacking in design
The moments surrender to endless pretenders
Confidence annulled, positive for sure

To guide me every move, directed by a fool
Whatever be the route, whatever be the road
Whatever be the road
Whatever be the road

Subconsciously
Constant conscious effort
Reminding me
Why do I forget this?

Inside of me
Master has a message,
The one undercover
The cause of the trouble
Sudden sense of doom
Get out while I could
Something to recover
What is the bother?

Ever undermind in every look I find

To guide me every move, directed by a fool
Whatever be the route, whatever be the road
Whatever be the road
Whatever be the road

Subconsciously
Constant conscious effort
Reminding me
Why do I forget this?

Inside of me
Master has a message,
Inside of me
Master has a message,
Decidedly inside of me emphatically
Master has a message
