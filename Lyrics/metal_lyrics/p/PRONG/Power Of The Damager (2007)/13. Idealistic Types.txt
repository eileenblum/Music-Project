[Bonus Track]Say you will get humble IÂ´m tryinÂ´ not to laugh
YouÂ´ll slide back ooh back itÂ´s all a joke to me

I know IÂ´m on the right road when all I see is trouble
Welcome to this world exactly how itÂ´s meant to be

Treat to the heavens GodÂ´s not hearing you

Â´Cause thereÂ´s no hope for mankind in adaptable shrines
Idealistic types keep on grievinÂ´
Our poisoned minds and insatiable likes
Blasphemous desires keep on breathinÂ´

Wish you were a martyr self proclaimed a saint
All the things to teach practicing what is preached

Message from the devil heÂ´s got plans for you

Â´Cause thereÂ´s no hope for mankind in adaptable shrines
Idealistic types keep on grievinÂ´
Our poisoned minds and insatiable likes
Blasphemous desires keep on breathinÂ´

ThereÂ´s no hope for mankind
No hope for mankind no hope for mankind

Uh burden of a prison inmate just as well
Live rules die by rule litigate you canÂ´t create

ThereÂ´s no hope for mankind in adaptable shrines
Idealistic types keep on grievinÂ´
Our poisoned minds and insatiable likes
Blasphemous desires keep on breathinÂ´

No hope for mankind no hope for mankind
No hope for mankind no hope for mankind
No hope for mankind no hope for mankind
