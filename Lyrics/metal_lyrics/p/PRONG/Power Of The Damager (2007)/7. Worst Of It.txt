Advantage no love
People playing
Yes they're staying with their ego

In silence alone
All upheaval
Yes still staying with my ego
With no resolve

Advantage feeding all your egos
Advantage meaningless as people
At last we're sucked into the evil life

Thanks for the worst of it
Thanks for the least of it
You never do it right
You never do it right

Change for the need of it

Judgemental control
The portrayals, the assails we're all in need of
Possession utmost in denial
Keep a journal of your demons
Of your demons

Advantage feeding all your egos
Advantage meaningless as people
At last we're sucked into the evil life

Thanks for the worst of it
Thanks for the least of it
Can you see the light
Can you see the light

Change for the egoist
Change

Advantage feeding all your egos
Advantage meaningless as people
At last you're sucked into the evil life

Thanks for the worst of it
Thanks for the least of it
You never do it right
You never do it right

Thanks for the worst of it
Thanks
Thanks
