Selected shape, a square or round wheel
Dimensions fate: how to sort you
A hit or miss - want to succeed?
No way to tell - how falls the mustard seed

Spirit guide calling, won't you intervene?
I've been waiting for someone to come
And take me by the hand
I've been waiting for someone to come
And take me by the hand...away from here
I've been waiting for someone to come

Awoke in daze, what was told here?
Less to trust - the mind is untrue
Which way to quit of what is not real?
In need of help from the allies of the unseen

Spirit guide calling, won't you intervene?
I've been waiting for someone to come
And take me by the hand
I've been waiting for someone to come
And take me by the hand...away from here

Push or shake? You never know
I can't feel with anything I got
Eternal woe, the need in sight
You cannot fear that: everything in fright
What is right?

I've been waiting for someone to come
And take me by the hand
I've been waiting for someone to come
And take me by the hand...away from here
I've been waiting for someone to come
I've been waiting for someone to come
One to come
