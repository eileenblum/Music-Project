I'm so disappointed I thought I found the one
Last to judge the laughers
That turned out to be none

So you're hearing me out
I'm alone in the light
I try keeping my mouth shut
I just want more

The options are getting clearer
The options

Who thought before tonight
Who'd be brought into this trial
Nothing could be foretold
Options
All about me

You never know when you've been robbed
The option I am told
You're either in or you are out
You've got your methods
I've my own
Third option of my own

I'm so disappointed
I thought I had the one
I'm so disappointed
I thought I'd fought and won

So you're hearing me out
I can never be right
Just keeping my mouth shut
I just want more

Who could hold on so tight (Options)
To what's gotten to be so old
It's time now for the same fight (Options)
Who could care less
It's all about me

The options are very real
The options
All about me

3rd option of my own
You're either in or you are out
3rd option of my own

Of what you know to be so right
You never know when you are wrong

Thrills, thrills, thrills
That's what I opt for
Thrills sick fills
That's when I'm out of sight
Sick thrills fills
That's what I want more
Thrills, thrills, thrills
That's what I opt for

Having you for one night
I'm alone in the light
What is all that I fight for
All crazy in life
The options are very real
The options are very clear
The options are very real
The options they are real
