Better keep looking behind your back
Times are about to change
The ignorant ones disobey our laws
Soon to be erased

Don't think doors will ever hide
The thoughts of any complaints
Believe in the cause, believe it or not
Elimination like the plague

We will find them
They will never know
They have no idea
That we are looking for them

Writing and naming in a black book
The numbers on display

There is no question
Opening of mouths
By methods we have our way

Gonna get hard for us to survive
Power it makes you afraid
Better keep looking behind your back
Things are about to change

We will find them
They will never know
They have no idea
That we are looking for them

We will find them
They will never know
They have no idea
That we are looking for them

Looking for them [X2]

They have no idea
That we are looking for them

They have no idea
We are looking for them

We will find them
They will

We will find them
They will never know

We will find them
They will

We will find them
They will never know

Looking for them [X7]
