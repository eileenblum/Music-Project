I can't help the way I feel
People disregard the truth
Can't stop the bleeding
Can't start the healing

Every day knives cut into you
Spear in my side opening wounds
'Til the spirit is bruised

I can't help the way you see
People disrespecting you
Can't base your readings
On what you're feeling

I can't help the way I feel
People disregard the truth
Can't stop the bleeding
Can't start the healing

Keep me untied
To what is untrue
Fearing inside keeping me glued with nothing to prove

Just can't change the way you see
With everybody hurtin' you
Can't change the meaning
Can't start the healing
Can't stop the bleeding
Can't stop the bleeding
Can't start the healing

We can't change the way you see
With everybody hurtin' you
We can't change the way you see
No more

I can't help the way I feel
People disregard the truth
Can't stop the bleeding
Can't start the healing

Everyone hides
Nothing to prove
Always disregard the truth
People disrespecting you
Can't stop the bleeding
Can't start the healing
Can't start the healing

Every day knives cut into you
Can't stop the bleeding
Can't start the healing
No more
