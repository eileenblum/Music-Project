Changing ending troubling times a bomb left on your door
Causing great discomfort as your house has just exploded
The rivers overflowing and the dimming of the sun
The hazardous carcinogens, the poisons in your lungs

Changing ending troubling times another love that's lost
Humiliating consequence don't ever show you're soft
Keeping pain inside you the heartaches never gone
Feel the warmth of a brand new day, the healing of the sun

Did you see that I saw that?
I saw that the end was right now
Have you seen that? You saw that?
The time to get out is right now

Changing ending troubling times a life consumed by debt
Running out of fortune with expenditures you've missed
Property foreclosing and diminishing of funds
The overdrawn the federal laws have put you on the run

Changing ending troubling times a new life to be born
Another soul in danger; in eternity turmoil
The future is so bleak and the casualties grow higher
Throwing us in prison or sending us to war

Did you see that I saw that?
I saw that the end was right now
Have you seen that? You saw that?
The time to get out
The time to get out is right now
The time to get out
The time to get out is right now

Changing ending troubling times
Get a little grip on tomorrow
Make sure you get through the day
Get a little grip on tomorrow

Take a little trip to the other side
Of what you're in store for
Go consult an oracle
See the blank page you signed up for

We don't know what the future may bring
The sorrow tomorrow will bring

Nothing we can do 'cept to give
A little smile to a fellow
I tell you better yet
Prepare to have to go it all solo

We don't know what the future may bring
The sorrow tomorrow will bring

Changing ending troubling times
Changing ending troubling times
Changing ending
Changing ending
Change end

Changing ending troubling times
Get a little grip on tomorrow
Take a little trip to the other side
Of what you're in store for

Changing ending troubling times
Get a little grip on tomorrow
Take a little trip to the other side
Of what you're in store for

Make sure you get through the day
Get a little grip on tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorr...
