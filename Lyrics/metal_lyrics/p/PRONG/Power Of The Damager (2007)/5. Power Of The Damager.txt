All around this world
Fear the imminent
Barricaded walled
More chastisement

All around I learn
A viscous calling
All about this world
All about my world
All about my world

What's all this for?
Bound and limited
Disregard my word
Fibs are prominent

What do I stand for?
Amongst corruption
Who controls this world?
Power in the world
Power in the world

Can you feel it?
Anger on the rise

Feel the grip on your throat
Power of the Damager
When your coffin is closed
Honer of the hammer

Power of the Damager

All around this world
Spins total confusion
All our souls are sold
To the Lord of the Decadent

All around you turn
Laughed and smitten
All around the world
All around this world

Can you feel it?
Anger on the rise

Takes control of your soul
Power of the Damager
The way your mouth has been sewn
Got to find a new singer

Can you feel it?
Anger on the rise

Feel the grip on your throat...Power of the Damager
Takes control of your soul...Power of the Damager
The way your mouth has been sewn...Power of the Damager
The way your coffin is closed...Power of the Damager

Power of the Damager [X2]
