If you're trying to ruin my life
You're doing a good job of it
If you're trying to cause me strife
I'm falling right into it

You don't want the same things as I
You want no part of it
Tired of hearing you come up with lies
To cover up your part in it

No justice in life
Nowhere to turn
Accusations and fights
There's nothing to learn

If you want better for yourself
Why can't you make a point of it?
You choose to deny any of my help
What do you want out of this?

Can't you admit the fault of your mind?
Why don't you come to grip with it?
All the denial causing more pain
Can't you see I'm sick of it?

What are you're fantasies, I don't know
Why can't you come clean with it?
All your taboos and all of your lies
Why can't you come clean with it?

No justice in life
Nowhere to turn
Accusations and fights
There's nothing to learn [X2]

No justice in life [X3]

What the fuck you doin' to make anything work
'Cept deny your own part in it?
What the fuck you doin' behind my back
To twist your own judgement?

No justice in life
Nowhere to turn
Accusations and fights
There's nothing to learn [X3]

No justice in life [X3]
