See them walk through the raindrops
See them not get drowned
I tend to see their perfect life
Squeaky clean and proud

No pain, no flaws,
No cheating wives
Just to hurt my pride
All that time so liquefied
I could not dry

It's a self will
Self will run riot
It's the self will
Self will run riot

Chasing all the good life
Shielding all the bad
Yielding to the allergy
Clinging to a dead life
Shaking is your hand
Yield to the extremities

Since it's pending an update
It's impossible to wait
Pushed ahead for it's too late
A leap of faith
Examining the futile
The progression of the vile
Destination the line of fire
A change of life

It's a self will
Self will run riot
It's the self will
Self will run riot

Chasing all the good life
Shielding all the bad
Yielding to the allergy
Clinging to a dead life
Shaking is your hand
Yield to the extremities

Then I paused a second
To contemplate upon this life
Regulation, redesigned
To find my guide

Chasing all the good life
Shielding all the bad
Yielding to the allergy
Clinging to a dead life
Shaking is your hand
Yield to the extremities

It's a self will
Self will run riot
It's the self will
Self will run riot
It's a self will
Self will run riot
It's the self will
Self will run riot
