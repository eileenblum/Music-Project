My mind has entered
a chamber of thought
It's something
you know nothing about
The dust settles a vacuum is packed
Getting filled for a silent attack

I am speechless I utter no word
Otherwise opinions are falsely formed
In a society where no one understands
A separate reality
with it's own demands

Incapable of humanity
Can no longer provide
In this mentality
Don't look inside
These hostilities
Inescapable
Don't look inside

This soul has been tarnished
with hard driven facts
Has entered a realm, forever in doubt
The floor that is beneath me
is moving very fast
But I am standing still,
dead in my tracks

Incapable of humanity
Can no longer provide
In this mentality
Don't look inside
These hostilities
Inescapable
Don't look inside

You throw your life away
With triviality
Enter liabilities
You shut your mind to stay
In unreality
Suffer indignities
You throw your life away
With triviality
Enter liabilities
You shut your mind to stay
In unreality
Suffer indignities
