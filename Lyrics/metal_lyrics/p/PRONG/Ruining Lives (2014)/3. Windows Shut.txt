It's getting so hard to try
It's getting very dark inside
To live in a definitive way
To strive further everyday

Light shut out

It's getting very hard to change
The efforts always laid to waste
A presence of eternal dismay
My vision now constantly stained
In the negative to rely
The positive to decry
Voices calling you through the vague
Telling you to "follow this way!"

Light shut out

Blinds drawn, light shut out
The windows are now shut
You can't see what then happens
On the inside or the out
Blinds drawn, light shut out
The windows are now shut
You can't see what will happen
If you walk right through the dark

Light shut out
Life in doubt
Light shut out

Blinds drawn, light shut out
The windows are now shut
You can't see what then happens
On the inside or the out
Blinds drawn, light shut out
The windows are now shut
You can't see what will happen
If you walk right through the dark

It' getting so hard to try...
