Never trusting comfort
Never trust in lies
When it's all in vain
You have arrived
A different situation
Now things have to change
Just ask me why

I've tried being righteous
and turned dissolute
Attempt more approaches
makes me more confused
Frustration keeps building
stature reduced

I tried resolutions
and they get diffused
With all good intents
a position to lose
Outside the solution
half measures half truths

In a matter of time
It's all subject to change
Come to realize
Then ascertain
To have arrived and overcame
Come to realize
The objection sustained

Don't you ever wonder
Don't you ever try
Guessing who's to blame?
Don't ask me why
To be determined to want to abstain
You have arrived

In a matter of time
It's all subject to change
Come to realize
Then ascertain
To have arrived and overcame
Come to realize
The objection sustained

I've tried being cautious
I've tried being shrewd
Arousing suspicions
Without any clues
Of my own invention
I have no excuse
I've tried being thoughtless
I've tried to conclude
Espousing convictions
despite any truths
Of my own perception
From my point of view

In a matter of time
It's all subject to change
Come to realize
Then ascertain
To have arrived and overcame
Come to realize
The objection sustained
