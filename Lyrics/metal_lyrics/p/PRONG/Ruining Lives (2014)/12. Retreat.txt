[Bonus Track]Thoughts actions doubts theyÂ´re crushing me
Faults sanctions blots bring me to sanity

Talked trite actions art transgressing me
Over and over thereÂ´s a crushing this land
They get away because they did to get back
Victor of predictable in every way
You got to work that just a who you gonna bring

Faults reactions sought just to bring me sanity
On the road to clarity

I wanna respect the shame
Nothing you can do nothing to do to compete
While weÂ´re not responding
All that you can do all you can do is retreat

Thoughts actions doubts addressing me
You canÂ´t control what next comes around
YouÂ´re endangering so deepen the morale
So fuck yourself in the position of the game
Maybe one day youÂ´ll learn to fuck another way
Faults sanctions blots bring me to clarity

I wanna respect the shame
Nothing you can do nothing to do to compete
While weÂ´re not responding
All that you can do all you can do is retreat
All you can do is retreat

Thoughts transactions oughts transgressing me
Thoughts actions doubts theyÂ´re pressing me
Thoughts transactions oughts transgressing me
Thoughts actions doubts theyÂ´re pressing me
To focus something on provisional decay
Is the one thing that is to fuck another way
Faults sanctions blots bring me to clarity

I wanna respect the shame
Nothing you can do nothing to do to compete
While weÂ´re not responding
All that you can do all you can do is retreat
The future is promising something you can do
Something to do for relief
The universe providing all thatÂ´s left to do
Nothing to do but retreat

All you can do is retreat retreat
