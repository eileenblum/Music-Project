I'm turning turning turning away
Cycling from this world
I'm turning turning changing perspective
On towards new forms
I've been fading fading away
Getting in touch with finality
Cascading falling away into the dawn

Like it turned on me a crisis a disease

Great power great range so defeaning
Turning it over is a blessing
More power more gain more mastery
The point of turning's necessary

Been burning burning burning away
Torchut from this world
Unlearning change of attention
No connection to old laws
I've been hating wasting away
Losing touch with infinity
Unblaming blaming staying away
I need to be reborn

Like it turned on me a crisis a disease
Like it turned on me a virus of unease

Great power great range so defeaning
Turning it over is a blessing
More power more gain more mastery
The point of turning's necessary

Turning turning turning turning turning
Turning over turning over
Turning over turning over turning over

Great power great range more mastery
More power more gain there's more for me

Great power great range so defeaning
Turning it over is a blessing
More power more gain more mastery
The point of turning's necessary go

Turning it over turning it over
Turn it over turning it over
