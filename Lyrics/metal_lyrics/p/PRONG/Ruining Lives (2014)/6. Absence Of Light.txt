There have been no signs 
There have been no clues
I'd look if I could find
It's not for me to chose

There have been no signs
I can't make a move
I'd look if I could find
There's nothing I can do
I've been left behind,
to sit here and brood
I've been in the blind,
I've been kept out of view

Getting dark with the absence of light
I'm not going, I'm not glowing
Feeling dark in the absence of light
There's nothing left inside

In a difficult time
Strength to be resolute
Time to clear my mind
Turn towards the absolute
There has been a sign
Now I'm back on the move
Look and you shall find
There's not more to lose
I've been left behind
but can't sit here and brood
I've been in the blind
and I'm living proof

Getting dark with the absence of light
I'm not going, I'm not glowing
Feeling dark in the absence of light
There's nothing left inside
In the dark with the absence of light
The not knowing, the not growing
In the dark with the absence of light
There's nothing left to hide

I see things that I wanted
I see nothing I need
I only see what is needed truly
The one thing that is perfect for me

There has been a sign
I can make a move
I looked and I did find
There's one thing to do
I was left behind
to sit there and brood
I was in the blind, now I got the proof

Getting dark with the absence of light
Feeling dark in the absence of light
There's nothing left inside

In the dark with the absence of light
The not knowing, the not growing
In the dark with the absence of light
There's nothing left to hide

I see things that I wanted
I see nothing I need
I only see what is needed truly
The one thing that is perfect for me

Getting dark with the absence of light
