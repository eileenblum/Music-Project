This must be a dream
Can't believe this is happening
This can't be real
Now in defeat gonna have to kneel
Reach out for a remedy,
searching for transparency
Barriers appeared
All built up right through the years

Tremble to think of what's in store
Reflect upon, recall,
the memories and nightmares
I had to take another fall
Reflect upon my world,
look right through the dark

More shall be revealed 
Through thoroughly examining
When you draw near
You get all the fear
from another ordeal
Got to keep on channeling
all that keeps you challenging
Do you have any idea,
of how you get relief?

To know, to clear
The barriers disappear
Decide, confide
Something will provide
Come close, draw near
The barriers disappear
Deny, misguide
Back to the start I slide

Reflect upon, recall,
the memories and nightmares
Reflect upon my world,
look right through the darkness
Tremble to think of what's in store
Reflect upon, recall,
the memories and nightmares
I had to take another fall
Reflect upon my world,
look right through the darkness

To know, to clear
The barriers disappear
Decide, confide
Something will provide
Come close, draw near
The barriers disappear
Deny, misguide
Back to the start I slide

Tremble to think what might befall
From wreckage to restored
From memories to nightmares
It's all a gift straight from above
Reflect upon, withdraw
Look right through the falseness
Tremble to think of what's in store
Reflect upon, recall,
the memories, the nightmares
I had to take another fall
Reflect upon my world,
look right through the darkness
Reflect upon my world,
look right through the darkness
