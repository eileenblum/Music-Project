Fueling a lie, issue a decree
Carrying out a conspiracy
General consent, the acceptable way
Anything goes you cannot complain

Ruining all of our lives
Shortchanging you
For every dime
Ruining all of your lives
They're squeezing you
Bleeding you
Using you

The ruining of life just to what degree
Deviance wins over morality
Perennial efforts of decay
Burying you as a casualty

Ruining all of our lives
Shortchanging you
For every dime
Ruining all of your lives
They're squeezing you
Bleeding you
Using you

Ruining all of our lives!

They're squeezing you
Bleeding you
Shortchanging you
Ripping you blind
Ruining you, rolling you
Ruling all of your mind
Ruining, ruining, ruining 
All of our lives

Ruining, all of our lives
Ruining, all of our lives
Don't you know that they're ruining
All of our lives
Don't you know that they're ruining
All of our lives
