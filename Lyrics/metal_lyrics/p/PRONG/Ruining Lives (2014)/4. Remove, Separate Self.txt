The world becoming so dead to me
Everything at a cost
Left here in total dismay
Of something I had recently bought
A disclosure can send me to panic
The potential is lost
It's best not to look your way
It's best that I'm gone

Remove, separate self
Disarming
Separate yourself
Undauntingly
Remove, separate self
Dismantling
Separating yourself
Convincingly

It all continued to get to me
Couldn't turn off the thoughts
The fear holding me at bay
Assumptions running their course
No composure it's so quick to panic
The resentment is lodged
It's best not to get your way
It's best to be undone

Remove, separate self
Disarming
Separate yourself
Undauntingly
Remove, separate self
Consistently
Separating yourself
Convincingly

Continue to grow into reasoning
Eventually flow into seasoning
You aren't worthless
like they make you feel
Not so broken you can never heal
Alleviate it all; partitioning
Socially divide; eliminating
You are stronger than they let you believe
And smarter than you seem

Eliminate, divide
Transform and modify
Eliminate, divide

Remove, separate self
Remove, separate self
Separating yourself
Separate yourself

Remove, separate self
Disarming
Separate yourself
Undauntingly
Remove, separate self
Continuously
Separating yourself
Convincingly

Remove, separate self
Remove, separate self
