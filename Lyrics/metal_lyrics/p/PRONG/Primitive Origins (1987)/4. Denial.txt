[Victor]

STAYING WITH THIS LIFE TO LEAD
ATTEMPTING NO TRUE TEST
STICKING WITH SOME SICK IDEAL
WHILE OTHERS SELL OUT FAST

NEED A BIT OF FLAGELLATION
NEED TO SCOUR THE DEPTHS
CAN'T EXERCISE AUTHORITY

CLAMPED DOWN CONTROLLED WILL
DENIAL, NO DISCIPLINE
REFRAINMENT ABSTINENCE
QUESTION CONVENIENCE

INGESTING SOME CORRUPT CONCEPT
CONSUMING ALL ITS PRODUCE
PULLING THOUGHTS AND CONSCIENCE
CONFIRMING ALL UNNOTICED
THE FULFILLMENT TRULY LIES
IN WHAT MUST BE SUPPRESSED
SUBJUGATING PASSION
LEAVES POWER UNPROFESSED
