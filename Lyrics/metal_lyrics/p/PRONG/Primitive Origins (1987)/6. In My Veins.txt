[Kirkland]

GALLON OF GASOLINE 
IN MY VEINS 
GALLON OF GASOLINE 
THE HANDS WENT NUMB
BLEEDING, COUGHING 
IN A ROOM THREE FEE DEEP
HOT AS A IRON 
BURNING HOLES IN MY FEET

HOLES IN MY KNEES 

IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD 
IT'S IN YOUR SKIN 
IT'S IN YOUR HEAD 
TEAR IT DOWN AND 
START AGAIN 

IT'S ONLY GOOD 
WHEN THE NEEDLES 
IN THE VEIN 

TEAR IT DOWN 
TEAR IT DOWN 
TEAR IT DOWN 
START AGAIN
