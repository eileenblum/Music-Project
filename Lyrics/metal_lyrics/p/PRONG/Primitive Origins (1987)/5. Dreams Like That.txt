[Kirkland]

PARTICIPANT 
IN A SICKENING SCENE
CAN'T TRUST THE COMFORT
OF YOUR BED 
THE PILLOW FOR YOUR HEAD

WE'VE ALL HAD BAD DREAMS
WE'VE ALL HAD BAD DREAMS
BUT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE
DREAMS LIKE THAT 
NO MORE DREAMS LIKE THAT
NO MORE DREAMS 

IT'S HARD TO BE A REALIST
LIFE'S SUCH A MESS 
CONSIDER THE LENGTH OF THAT FALL
THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO FALL

NO MORE DREAMS LIKE THAT
NO MORE DREAMS LIKE THAT
NO MORE DREAMS LIKE THAT
NO MORE DREAMS LIKE THAT
