[Kirkland, Victor]

A CRUMBLING TOWER AT THE SITE OF AN EARTHQUAKE
NEW CORPORATE QUARTERS NOW NOT SO HIGH
SOME DISCONNECTION CAUSES AERIAL CONFUSION
THE HUNDRETH PLANE TO FALL OUT OF THE SKY

A HOUSE OF LABOR LEAKS A VENOMOUS EMITION
LEAVES POOR PEASANTS, SUFFERING AMASS
COUNTRIES SCOURGED BY UNNECESSARY FAMINE
THE WALKING SKELETONS STILL CLING TO LIFE

BLAME IT ON THE GODS

THE PEOPLE'S HERO KILLED BY CRIME OF PASSION
IT'S THEN REPORTED THAT HE LIVED A LIE
ANOTHER MENTOR ENTANGLED IN CORRUPTION
HIS SORDID DEALING LEFT MANY TO DIE.
