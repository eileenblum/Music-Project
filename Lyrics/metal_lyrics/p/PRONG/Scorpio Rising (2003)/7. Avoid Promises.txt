You got the reason why I'm falling way out of way
I know it's easy to be of promise I'm calling out to pray
I know the reason why I'm calling way out to pray
It's never easy to believe a promise I'm stalling now to say
All insane all in vain all for lack of a reason
All insane all in vain all for lack of a reason
I got no reason why I'm crawling on this certain way
I know it's easy to be anonymous not crawling to be safe
For some reason I am falling falling out of way
I think I'm ceasing to be harnessed avoid it any way
All insane all in vain all for lack of a reason
All insane all in vain all for lack of a reason
All insane all in vain all for lack of a reason
All insane all in vain all for lack of a reason
