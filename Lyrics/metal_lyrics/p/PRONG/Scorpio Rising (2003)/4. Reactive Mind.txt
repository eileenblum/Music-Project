Spirits of this world trying to trip me out
Filling me with fear keeping me in doubt
Don't do it can't do it
Never find it right never see no light
Never whole inside nonsense in my mind
So done with it I'm over it
Tired of basin' my life on reactive mind
I'm a dependant type to be self sufficient
Delusions how they hide how can't survive
The confusing needs others cursing me
Can't have it can't live with it
Tired of basin' my life on the reactive mind
I'm a dependant type to be self sufficient
Tired of basin' my life on the reactive mind
I'm a dependant type to be
Self sufficient self sufficient whoa
I'm a dependant type
I'm a dependant type with reactive mind
Need to magnify the will to get right
Enough is always more but don't want to score
Can't have it can't do it
I'm a dependant type with reactive mind
I'm a dependant type with reactive mind
To be self sufficient self sufficient
