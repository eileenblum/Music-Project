At times I think you served injustice sometimes I take it blessing alone
At times I feel so disserviced other times I thank God alone
Was it a gift of independence to find my own self as a whole
But mostly I think you were selfish not knowin' these answers at all
Which one was it whichever it shall be
Which one was it to be kind or displease
I really wanna know it with silence I'm not free which one was it
But now in a flash I realize experience wisdom to know
Did this myself to conquer the worm of your cavernous soul
Which one was it whichever it shall be
Which one was it to be kind of displease
I really wanna know it with silence I'm not free
Can I let go of it can you answer truthfully
Don't you remember you never did answer me
Left to interpret alone don't you remember
I never got an answer can I try to resolve
I really wanna know it with silence I'm not free
Can I let go of it can you answer truthfully
But now in a flash I realize experience wisdom to know
Did this myself to conquer the worm of your cavernous soul
Which one was it now I really don't care
Which one was it I hope I never ask that question again
Which one was it now I really don't care
Which one was it I hope I never ask that question again
I really wanna know it with silence I'm not free
Can I let go of it can you answer truthfully
