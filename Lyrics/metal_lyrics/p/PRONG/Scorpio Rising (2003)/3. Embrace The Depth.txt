Initiation into a whole other realm of being
Initiation into a new way of becoming
Transfiguration a step into the rest
A true condition an embrace into the depth
To be where you need to be to be where you wanna be
To see what you need to see to see what you cannot see
To be where you need to be to be where you wanna be
To see what you need to see to see what you cannot see
Embrace the depth embrace the depth
Embrace the depth embrace the depth
Embrace the depth embrace the depth
Initiation balance beam on the cross
Initiation lightbringer to the lost
Appreciation of all and all that's gone
An affirmation of what one has become
Initiation embrace the depth embrace the depth
Initiation embrace the depth embrace the depth
Into a whole other realm of being into a new way of becoming
A step into the rest an embrace into the depth
Beam on the cross lightbringer to the lost
Of all and all that's gone of what one has become
To be where you need to be to be where you wanna be
To see what you need to see to see what you cannot see
To be where you need to be to be where you need to be
To be where you wanna be to be where you wanna be
To see what you need to see to see what you need to see
To see what you cannot to see what you cannot see
Embrace the depth embrace the depth
Embrace the depth embrace the depth
Embrace the depth embrace the depth
Embrace the depth embrace the depth
