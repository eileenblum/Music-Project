Whoa all in vain trouble for the man is all the same for the most part
Would never have thought that I'd ever come close to this inside
Equal in the fact that we all may pass at anytime
Illusion is gone new clarity of thought and the insight
Too serious now for clouded eyes gonna look right
I'm gonna tell you it's all in vain the choice is made
I'm gonna tell you there is no blame gonna tell you
We're gonna roll right through it all
It's not affecting it has no meaning detached from it all
All in vain subtle for the hands if not much pain for the lost heart
Remainder of the being bold enough keep their heads high
Keeping those away from what they know is a total lie
I'm gonna tell you its all in vain it's all a game choice is made
There is no blame it's all in vain I'm gonna tell you
We're gonna roll right through it all
It's not affecting it has no meaning detached from it all
It's not affecting our daily living detached from it all
All in vain gonna tell you it's all a game
Gonna tell you the choice is made gonna tell you its all in vain
All in vain gonna tell you the choice is made
Gonna tell you it's all the same for the most part
Gonna tell you it's all in vain gonna tell you
We're gonna roll right through it all
It's not affecting it has no meaning detached from it all
We're gonna roll right through it all
It's not affecting it has no meaning it's not affecting our daily living
We're not expecting it's not defeating detached from it all
