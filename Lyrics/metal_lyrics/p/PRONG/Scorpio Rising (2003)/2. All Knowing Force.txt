We make the best records we make the best records
We make the best records we make the best records

Nothing fuckin' worked no matter how hard I tried
Wanted all to be perfect wanted it to be right

All knowing force what is this worth
All knowing forced to believe in
All knowing force a time for growth
All knowing forced to believe in

We make the best records we make the best records
We make the best records we make the best records
We make the best records we make the best records
We make the best records we make the best records

I relinquish it all tappin' into the signs
Now I've been let down disappointment at a height
Absorb the energy takin' in the vibe
Doesn't need to be perfect expect to be right

All knowing force what is this worth
All knowing forced to believe in
All knowing force a time for growth
All knowing forced to believe in forced whoa

Nothing fucking worked how hard I tried
Wanted it to be perfect expect to be right

All knowing force what is this worth
All knowing forced to believe in
All knowing force a time for growth
All knowing forced to believe in

We make the best records we make the best records
We make the best records we make the best records
We make the best records we make the best records
We make the best records we make the best records
