Ooh playin' with my coins I'm gonna be the changemaker
With a single iron bar you tend to set your limitations
Moving on the next sale
Going for the moment breakin' out of boredom
Climbin' from the bottom comin' from the cauldron
Inner truth to the surface inner truth to the surface aah
With the path of the snake I'm gonna be your changemaker
Crawling on the floor you tend to set your limitations
Moving on to the next scale
Seizing of the moment breakin' out of boredom
Climbin' from the bottom comin' from the cauldron
Inner truth to the surface inner truth to the surface
Aah inner truth to the surface inner truth to the surface
Goin' for the moment breakin' out of boredom
Goin' for the moment breakin' out of boredom
Climbin' from the bottom breakin' out of boredom
Climbin' from the bottom comin' from the cauldron
Climbin' from the bottom breakin' out of boredom
Climbin' from the bottom comin' from the cauldron
Inner truth to the surface inner truth to the surface
Aah inner truth to the surface inner truth
