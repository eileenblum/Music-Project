Face to face with you my law I hope to all day reach that call
You forgave my every fall I never knew what you were about
Face to face with truth your word why did I listen to wrongs I heard
Self help methods schemed by jesters
Getting advice from the earth's master
One drop a word to the wise
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
Go forward with the seed of a planter
With mortar and bricks of a builder
One drop a word to the wise
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
Face to face with you my law I hope to all day reach that calm
As I set my heart upon your rock I put my eye on the golden orb
As I weep for those unlearned the ones too stiff for necks to turn
Self help methods schemed by jesters
Getting advice from the earth's master
One drop a word to the wise
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
Go forward with the seed of a planter
With mortar and bricks of a builder
One drop a word to the wise
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
Face to face with you my law I hope to all day reach that call
You forgave my every fall I never knew what you were about
Face to face with you my law I hope to all day reach that call
One drop a word to the wise
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
Out of this realm leave the stones behind
I never knew what you were about forgave my every fall
Forgave my every fall forgave my every fall
Forgave my every fall forgave my every fall
