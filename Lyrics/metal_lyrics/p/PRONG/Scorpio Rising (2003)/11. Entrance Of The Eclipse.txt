Entering as an eclipse a fiery orb with wings
Sent into beast body to conquer ungodly grips
Transform into a pyramid a triangle of holy devour
To become diamond powerful jewel
Shining brighter and brighter
To give eye to be wise to give grace a new space
Lift uplifter lift extract into the abyss
Sift great sifter sift entrance of the eclipse
Just a sojourner with no luggage to heed
A furious passserby with rod and ox to steer
Overcoming earth's cursed throne next plane to provoke
The camelback patriarch seven miles to go
Lift uplifter lift extract into the abyss
Sift great sifter sift entrance of the eclipse
Lift uplifter lift extract into the abyss
Sift great sifter sift entrance of the eclipse
To give eye it's getting brighter and brighter
To be wise it's getting dire and dire
To give eye it's getting brighter and brighter
To be wise it's getting dire and dire
Lift uplifter lift sift great sifter sift
It's getting brighter and brighter
It's getting dire and dire well
Yeah lift uplifter lift extract into the abyss
Sift great sifter sift entrance of the eclipse
Lift uplifter lift extract into the abyss
Sift great sifter sift entrance of the eclipse
It's getting brighter and brighter to be wise
It's getting brighter and brighter to be wise
It's getting dire and dire
