The aeonÂ´s lights are shining brightly ahead
They haunt the lonely years with perfect intent
They send a message
That will help us channel the mind
Universally cementing the perfect design

Carved into stone carved into stone
A method to release
All or nothing all or nothing
Carved into stone carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing all or nothing

The symbols and signs arrive
Emerge from the depth
Imprinting upon the minds
In search for whatÂ´s next
We need a presence
That will guide us out of the blind
The affirmation that will promise all of our sight

Carved into stone carved into stone
A method to release
All or nothing all or nothing
Carved into stone carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing all or nothing

I need a method that will help me
Get right through the night
ThereÂ´s really not a whole lot left
Things are passing by
And things are flying by
Things are moving way too fast

Carved into stone carved into stone
Carved into stone carved into stone

I need a method that will help me
Get right through the night
ThereÂ´s really not a whole lot left
Things are passing by
And things are flying by
Things are moving way too fast

A method to release
All or nothing all or nothing
Carved into stone carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing all or nothing
Carved into stone a method to release
Carved into stone carved into stone
Carved into stone carved into stone
A message to believe
All or nothing all or nothing
Carved into stone carved into stone
