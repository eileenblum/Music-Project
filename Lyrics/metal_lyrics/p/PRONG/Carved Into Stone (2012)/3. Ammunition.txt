You bleed when I fire your fall I aspire
I cannot change your ways
ItÂ´s pointless canÂ´t you see
You are far from hope your end is what I need

Liberation ammunition

Liability control itÂ´s the blood on your soul
ItÂ´s nothing to deny your passing

Revenge is my style defense from my rivals
Already see your fate I smile at what you see
The powder in my veins endless possibility

Liberation ammunition

Liability control itÂ´s the blood on your soul
ItÂ´s nothing to deny your passing

Got ammunition you canÂ´t survive no way
Got ammunition to end your life
Got ammunition I have arrived no way
Got ammunition got ammunition
Liberation no way no way no way

Liberation ammunition

Liability control itÂ´s the blood on your soul
ItÂ´s nothing to deny your passing

Got the ammunition got the ammunition
Ammunition got the ammunition
