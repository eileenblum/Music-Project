Looking out of windows
Looking under cars, cars, cars, cars
Like to keep you thinkin'
Staying on guard on guard, on guard, on guard
Nothing ever happens you wonder why
The constant paranoia is of someone's design
Doorbell is ringin' no one's outside

I like my revenge best served cold
For a lack of respect and a lack of a soul

Best served cold

Suddenly a shadow under your door
A click of a magazine your door's not secured
Find an old photograph
Was that ever there, there, there, there
Are those really footsteps walking up your stairs

I like my revenge best served cold
For a lack of respect and a lack of a soul
I like my revenge best served cold
With total contempt of an arctic storm

Best served cold
I like my revenge best served cold

Me and you there's a history unattended to
It's a story with no ending to
With a mystery of who's after you
Me and you you wonder why it never happens to you
With no one really getting back to you
This history of me and you

I like my revenge best served cold
For a lack of respect and a lack of a soul
I like my revenge best served cold
With total contempt of an arctic storm

I like my revenge best served cold
I like my revenge best served cold
I like my revenge best served cold
