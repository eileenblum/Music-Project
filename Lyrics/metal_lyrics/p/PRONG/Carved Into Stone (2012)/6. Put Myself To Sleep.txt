DonÂ´t feel too strong about anything
Getting more difficult to breathe
Bad memories from the past
Dissension difficulty at best

Disinterested in whatÂ´s the right way
Disillusioned by whatÂ´s wrong

Put myself to sleep the tension of need
Put myself to sleep no longer living a dream

Consistently lying in between
What could be worse of all routine
Distressed by matters of fact
Kept awake I wonÂ´t react

DonÂ´t give me part of the blame game
Pay attention to my namesake

Put myself to sleep the tension of need
Put myself to sleep no longer living a dream

DonÂ´t you know youÂ´re a witness
To the dark days of our lives
With a bit of resistance you fail to realize
With a bit of persistance
May the light shine on your life
DonÂ´t you know when a witness
Your world just passes by

Put myself to sleep put myself to sleep
No longer living a dream

Put myself to sleep the tension of need
Put myself to sleep no longer living a dream

Put myself to sleep to sleep
Put myself to sleep
