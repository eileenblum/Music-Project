Hear you scream they are thieves
As you scheme and hide behind political themes
So much greed youÂ´re not free
But you speak in this country openly
So youÂ´re bitching best watch yourself

When itÂ´s time for you to pay you abstain
Feed your ego thatÂ´s your aim

A list of grievances I now write

You should just stop so much you donÂ´t know about
Just end it now something weÂ´ll all cheer about

An enemy of society
Hear you speak like you are a deity
I got it now you canÂ´t trust so unjust
ItÂ´s your business thatÂ´s corrupt

Complain like everybody else

Self invest self impress in excess
You and your self righteousness

A list of grievances I now write

You should just stop so much you just talk about
ItÂ´s got to end the same things weÂ´ve all heard about
You should just stop so much you donÂ´t know about
Just end it now something weÂ´ll all cheer about

ItÂ´s time for lies itÂ´s time for lies
ItÂ´s time for debts itÂ´s time for debts
IÂ´m just keeping sheets of broken rules
The side of right the side of right
The side of left the side of left
In between and everything untrue untrue

You should just stop so much you donÂ´t know about
Just end it now something weÂ´ll all cheer about
You should just stop the same things weÂ´ve all heard about
ItÂ´s got to end too much thatÂ´s just talk
