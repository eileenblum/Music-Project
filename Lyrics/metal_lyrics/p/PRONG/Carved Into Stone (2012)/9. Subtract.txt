Living a lie itÂ´s an illusion anyway
Up in the sky you must throw it all away
Living a lie an illusion anyway
Up in the sky you must throw it all away
So contrived see the falseness of the world
Just to get by lose the truth of the real world

Everything leaves me nothing can hide
Nothing that I need is left of my mind
Everything leaves me
Nothing that I need nothing I can hide

Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world

Living a lie an illusion anyway
Up in the sky you must throw it all away
ItÂ´s so contrived see the falseness of the world
Just to get by lose the truth of the real world

Everything leaves me nothing can hide
Nothing that I need is left of my mind
Everything leaves me
Nothing that I need nothing I can hide

Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world

Everything leaves me nothing can hide
Nothing that I need is left in my mind
Everything leaves me
Nothing that I need nothing I can hide

Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world youÂ´re living a lie
Subtract into the real world
Subtract into the real world youÂ´re living a lie

Into the real world a lie into the real world
DonÂ´t you know youÂ´re living a lie
Into the real world a lie into the real world
DonÂ´t you know youÂ´re living a lie
