Sit around feeling negated
Tired of beinÂ´ told what to do
Have to listen to continual hatred
You can count me out
What you got to prove

What a way to spend prime time
Tell me I donÂ´t know
In a state of rebellion
Too much stuff of my own

These tensions kill oneÂ´s being
Rebellion means nothing

A wasted life with something to prove
A wasted life with something to prove
A wasted life a waste of life
A wasted life with nothing to prove

Look around always berated
The sick situation at hand
All to do is continue complaining
What things to cry about
Your selfish demands

IÂ´m too old to spend my time
Concerned about these affairs
Had my share of rebellion
It got me totally nowhere

Aggression solves nothing
These tensions kill oneÂ´s being

A wasted life with something to prove
A wasted life with something to prove
A wasted life a waste of life
A wasted life with nothing to prove

There is no detour from the hard road hard road
No deviation from the path
One has to reach some destination destination
DonÂ´t walk around in the dark in the dark

A wasted life with something to prove
A wasted life with something to prove
A wasted life a waste of life
A wasted life with nothing to prove
A wasted life with nothing to prove
