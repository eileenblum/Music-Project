Need to be insistent
On the path of least resistance

Now youÂ´re sitting in space
The perception hundred years from today
ItÂ´s a clean existence
On the path of least resistance

Never trusting my own name
Remember all thatÂ´s fake
Seeking out whatÂ´s vain bestroying all disgrace
Allowing for the truth becoming more removed
In a world thatÂ´s for the blind
Removal of the sight removal of the sight

Now relinquish the chains
Supplement them with healing today
Need to be insistent
On the path of least resistance

Never trusting my own name
Remember all thatÂ´s fake
Seeking out whatÂ´s vain destroying all disgrace
Allowing for the truth becoming more removed
In a world thatÂ´s for the blind
Removal of the sight removal of the sight

Keep calling on fate shadows of the brain
Need to be insistent
On the path of least resistance
Keep calling on fate need to be insistent
On the path of least resistance
Keep calling on fate need to be insistent
On the path of least resistance
Need to be insistent

Now youÂ´re sitting in space
The perception hundred years from today
ItÂ´s a lean existence
On the path of least resistance
Now relinquish the chains
Supplement them with healing today
Need to be insistent
On the path of least of resistance
Keep calling on fate I keep calling on fate
A condition you only create
Need to be insistent
On the path of least resistance
You keep calling on fate I keep calling on fate
Need to be with the shadows of the brain
ItÂ´s a clean existence
On the path of least resistance
