For what I do this every day
Without potential for success
Keep hoping that I will persist
To apathy I will admit

I used to keep wrackinÂ´ my brain
Doing everything the same
To the question of attitude renewed
I simply explain

For what keep on living in pain
So what keep on living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
To that no reason we are living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
So what keep on living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
To that no reason we are living in pain

For what I reach in then I pay
With more delusion I invest
Further into the unknown
Into a world that will not last
No time to give yourself hope
No no desires to enhance
Now we have the overload

A new deflection an attitude renewed
I never wanted to know
I never knew you could have it this way
Everything has got to go

For what keep on living in pain
So what keep on living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
To that no reason we are living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
So what keep on living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
To that no reason we are living in pain

They told you you were in control
I never wanted to know
No time to give yourself hope
I tell you everythingÂ´s got to go

For what keep on living in pain
So what keep on living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
To that no reason we are living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
So what keep on living in pain
For what keep on living in pain
To that no reason we are living in pain
