[T. Victor]

THE FLAG OF FREE ENTERPRISE, FRONTS AS YOU FEND
IN THE BATTLEFIELD OF BUREAUCRACY, THE TRENCHES YOU SHALL TEND
IN THESE DAYS OF ADVERSITY, THE HASSLE NEVER ENDS.
THE NEMESIS OF FORTITUDE, HOLDS A GUN TO YOUR HEAD!
ON YOUR KNEES! KNEEL! SAY YOUR PRAYERS!
FOR DEAR LIFE! FOR DEAR LIFE! FOR DEAR LIFE! FOR DEAR LIFE!
YOU'RE HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE!
SHOW SOME HUMILITY TO THE POWERS THAT BE.
A GESTURE TO MORTALITY -- YOUR BLIND LIBERTY.
ON YOUR KNEES! KNEEL! SAY YOUR PRAYERS!
FOR DEAR LIFE! FOR DEAR LIFE! FOR DEAR LIFE! FOR DEAR LIFE!
YOU'RE HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE!
LIFE. FOR DEAR LIFE.
