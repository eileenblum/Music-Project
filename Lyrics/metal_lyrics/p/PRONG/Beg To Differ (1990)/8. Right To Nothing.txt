[T. Victor]

COLD SUNS, LOWERING HIGHS.
ACCENTS ON THE DEPRIVED.
SOLVENCY. WELL, IT HURTS LIKE A BITCH.
CLOSE SHAVE, YOU MAY HAVE GROWN RICH.
BLAST OFF, WAITING ON LINE. SALES PITCH MAKES UP YOUR MIND.
YOU GOT THE RIGHT TO NOTHING.
THE RIGHT TO NOTHINGNESS
RIGHT TO SOMETHING.
THE RIGHT TO NOTHINGNESS
WELL, ALL OF YOUR GOALS AND WHAT YOU'VE BECOME --
SURRENDER NOW! YOU'RE THE SATISFIED ONE.
YOU GOT THE RIGHT TO NOTHING.
THE RIGHT TO NOTHINGNESS
RIGHT TO SOMETHING.
THE RIGHT TO NOTHINGNESS.
