[T. Victor-T. Parsons]

SHAKE THE SLAB OF FLESH, TAUNTING FOR A FETCH,
TIME TO RING THE CHIME.
WET THE APPETITE, TEETH ARE GRINDING TIGHT,
REINFORCING LIFE.
DROOLING DOWN THE SIDES, EYES ARE BULGING WIDE
YES THE PRICE IS RIGHT.
THE CUT IS VERY TOUGH, GRISTLES GOOD ENOUGH
THEY ALL NEED A BITE.
NO TOLLING OF THE BELL, JUST THE ONE TO HELL
THERE THEY'LL ALL KNOW.
THIMBLEFUL TO CHANCE, PAY THE LUXURY TAX
DO NOT PASS GO.
TRY AND BRING THE BEEF, SEE WHAT IS TO KEEP
NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.
THE CUT IS VERY TOUGH, YOU BIT THE BIG BLUFF
TAKE ANOTHER BITE.
