[T. Victor-T. Parsons]

YOU MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES, I BEG TO DIFFER
RATHER BE A FOOL AND SEE THINGS CLEARER.
YOU FOUND A QUICK WAY TO FILL YOUR POCKET.
THAT'S THE WAY IN A WORLD THAT'S LOST IT
TO FALL IN LINE
ITS MEANINGLESS, MINDLESSNESS.
I BEG TO DIFFER
DISHARMONY AMONGST ALL OUR BROTHERS.
THAT'S OKAY, BE TRUE TO OUR GRUDGES.
NO DESIRE TO WALK BESIDE YOU.
NOTHING POSITIVE WHEN FORCED UPON YOU.
(SO FALL IN LINE) JUST FALL IN LINE
ITS MEANINGLESS, MINDLESSNESS, I BEG TO DIFFER
