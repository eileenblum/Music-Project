[M. Kirkland-T. Victor]

YOU CHOOSE A PATH
CLOSE TO COLLAPSE
STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT
FALLING APART
THE LIGHT TURNS BACK
WHERE YOU CHOOSE TO PASS
FINALLY INTO OBLIVION
STEADY DECLINE
A QUIRK OF FATE
CAN'T STOP THIS WAIT
BIT IT TOOK
A QUIRK OF FATE
TO IGNITE THE SPARK
INNOCENCE AND YOUTH
YOUTH AND INNOCENCE
TAKES SO LITTLE TO TEAR IT APART
TEAR IT APART
STEADY DECLINE
WITNESS TO THE CRIME
