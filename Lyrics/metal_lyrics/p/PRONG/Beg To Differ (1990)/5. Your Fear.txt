[M. Kirkland-T. Parsons-T. Victor]

HIS HOLY MISUNDERSTOOD
MISDIRECTED, MISCONSTRUED
THIS HOLY ROLL OF THE DICE
TAKE YOUR CHANCES
HOLD ON TIGHT
SILENCE THE SILENT
CONFUSE THE CONFUSED
CONFUSION RUNS RAMPANT
ON A SHIP OF FOOLS
THE CLOCK IS TICKING
THIS SACRED JOKE
LEFT WITHOUT A REASON
TILL REASON TAKES HOLD
SURRENDER YOUR FEAR
CRAWL INTO THE FLAME
HIS HOLY UNCONSCIOUSNESS
ENDLESS DISCUSSION
OF OUR USELESSNESS
ALIVE AND KICKING
THIS SACRED JOKE
LEFT WITHOUT A REASON
TILL REASON TAKES HOLD
SURRENDER YOUR FEAR
CRAWL INTO THE FLAME
