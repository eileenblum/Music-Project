[T. Victor]

EXPOSING ALL THE FRAUDS, THOSE HEROES FOR A CAUSE.
THEY'RE HOLDING SOME KEY, CONFUSING IDENTITIES.
THE LOST AND FOUND
LOST IN A CROWD
LOOK WHAT THEY'VE FOUND
THEY'RE FAKING IN THE BUCK.
PURVEYORS OF SO MUCH LUCK.
UPHOLDING A TRUE SCOPE: FLAG WAVING EGO.
THE LOST AND FOUND
LOST IN A CROWD
LOOK WHAT THEY'VE FOUND
THE LOST AND FOUND!
