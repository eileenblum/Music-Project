[D. Edge H. Creed]

SEEING THEIR CHILDREN, CAUGHT UP IN THE LATEST FAD
THEIR PARENTS ARE WORRIED, THINKING THEY'VE GONE BAD
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME, NOTHING HAS CHANGED
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME
NOTHING HAS CHANGED; CHANGES TOMORROW
TAKING THEIR AXES, THEY'RE TURNING AN AMBER RED
MAKING A NOISE ABLE TO WAKE THE DEAD.
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME, NOTHING HAS CHANGED
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME
NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL, CHANGED IN OUR WORLD
LOOKING THROUGH WINDOWS ONLY TO SEE THE RAIN.
THE WAY THEY ARE MOVING, GROUND ZERO ATTACK MY BRAIN
