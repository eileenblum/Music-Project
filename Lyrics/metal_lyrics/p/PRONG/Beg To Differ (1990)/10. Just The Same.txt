[T. Victor-M. Kirlkland-T. Parsons]

THE RETREADS ON THE GO
THOUGHT IT WAS A HOAX
BUT LOOKED AROUND AND SAW IT
READY TO AGAIN EXPLODE
WHEN WILL IT GO AWAY?
TOO BAD IT'S HERE TO STAY.
RECYCLED, NEW IMPROVED, JUMP ON IT AND GET SAFE!
THEY LIKE IT SHALLOW, THEY LIKE IT FAKE
LIKE IT BORROWED
LIKE IT NARROW, LIKE THEIR BRAIN
THEY'RE GONNA SWALLOW
JUST THE SAME
UNDER THE GUISE OF LATE, FOR THOSE BORN TOO LATE
A CONCEPT BENEFACTING A CULTURE IN A NEEDY STATE.
SO WHAT IF IT'S BEEN USED, AS LONG AS NO ONE SUES
JUST REHASH AND TRASH IT FOR THE FOOLS TO USE AND GET SAFE!
THEY LIKE IT SHALLOW, THEY LIKE IT FAKE
LIKE IT BORROWED
LIKE IT NARROW, LIKE THEIR BRAIN
THEY'RE GONNA SWALLOW
JUST THE SAME
GENRES OVER SOLD, SAMPLED AND STOLE.
REDISCOVERED THEMES SO POORLY OVER TOLD.
THE WAGONS ON THE ROAD, WORN OUT THOUGHT ABODE
TIRED STYLE LOST NOW FINDS A NEW HOME.
