Time for reward
It's been so hard
Just living here

Transcend the self
Remove the sight
Ending the fear

Escape the fault
Widen the gap
Kill off the facts

That are gonna hurt my mind
That are gonna stain my soul
Another worldly device
That may ruin me

That are gonna ruin my goals
That are gonna take its toll
Another worldly device
Another

Worldly release
Take back myself
From this here self

The ones that you do
Must hold some truth
To what you should

I will perceive
The will persists
I must omit

What's gonna hurt my mind
What's gonna stain my soul
Another worldly device
That may ruin me

Not gonna block my goals
Not gonna take its toll
Another worldly device
Another

Worldly device
More wrong advice
Another broken promise

What's gonna hurt my mind
What's gonna stain my soul
Another worldly device
That may ruin me

Not gonna block my goals
Not gonna take its toll
Another worldly device
Another worldly device
Another worldly device
