Playing on the hate team
Shut out
Cut out of the mainstream

If you like to play victim
And play the part so well
That's how we'll treat you
If it suits you so well

Hey now it's all turning
Watch your world burn
Hey now it's all burning
Watch your world turn

Playing on the hate team
Shut out
Cut out of the mainstream
Playing for the hate team
Hate team

Hey now it's all burning
Watch your world turn
Hey now it's all turning
Watch your world burn

If you never felt decent
And you feel rather mean
Don't wear your hurt so pathetic
Let your mind set you free

Play for the hate team
Shut out cut
Out of the mainstream

Hey now it's all burning
Watch your world turn
Hey now it's all turning
Watch your world burn

Who's fist is this anyway?
Who's fist is this anyway?
Who's fist is this anyway?

Who's fist is this anyway?
Who's fist is this anyway?
Who's fist is this anyway?
Who's fist is this anyway?
Who's fist is this anyway?
