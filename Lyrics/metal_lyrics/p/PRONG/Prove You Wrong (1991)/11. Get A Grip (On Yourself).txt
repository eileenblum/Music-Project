Did not have the money round to buy a Moray Thou
Been around and seen a lot to shake me anyhow
Begged and borrowed sometimes I admit I even stole
The worse crime that I ever did was play some rock and roll.

But the money is no good
Just get a grip on yourself
But the money is no good
Just get a grip on yourself
And you should know

Suffering convictions on a two-way stretch inside
The air in here is pretty thin, I think I will go outside
Committed for insanity and crimes against the soul
The worst crime that I ever did was play some rock and roll.

Now I find from week to week the sentence sticking fast
Turn the corner, rub my eyes and hope the world will last
Stranger from another planet welcome to our hole
Just strap on your guitar and we will play some rock and roll
