News of senseless agression
Journalistic sensation, quick reasons to mention
Paraded so soulfully
Stated so righteously
One vision to convey
Nothing more to say

The cause - no way to deny it
Ignore it it won't disappear
No way to deny it
The wrongs - no way to deny them
Ignore them they won't disappear
No way to deny it

News eating the nation
Editorialization (quick reasons to mention)
Concluded too easily
Repeated in history
Someone's got to pay
Nothing more to say

News of constant deception
Censored reception
Quick reasons to mention
Soudbites - all too clear
Left rights!
The end is near!
Someone's got to pay
Nothing more to say

Thanks to nirajpandya for sending track #11 lyrics.
