Cut and dry.
You can't be deceived.
You can't live a lie.
Cut and dried.
Full of self esteem.
Hold your head up high.
Cut and dry.
You can never be deceived.
You still have a life apart from the regime.
Cut and dry.
You can never disbelieve. Part of the machine.
Hold your head up high.
Never mind the questions.
Forget about the answers.
I can't wait to see a tearful revelation.
Just jump to believe.
What is told.
What is sold.
You'll pay to breathe.
The tyranny and oppression.
The daily reprieve.
A fearful situation.
Cut and dry.
You'll remain in need.
You will question life.
Cut and dry.
Victim of a scheme. Hang your head and cry.
Cut and dried.
You will be deceived. You won't have a life.
Apart from your routine.
Cut and dried.
You can never be believed. Slave to the machine.
Hang your head and cry.
Never mind the questions.
Forget about the answers.
I can't wait to see.
The tearful revelations.
Just jump to believe.
What is told. What is sold.
You'll pay to breathe. The tyranny and oppression.
The daily reprieve.
A fearful situation.
Cut and dry.
Cut and dried.
Cut and dry.
Cut and dry.
Cut and dry.
I can't wait to see.
The tearful revelations.
Just jump to believe.
What is told. What is sold.
You'll pay to breathe. The tyranny and oppression.
The daily reprieve.
A fearful situation.
Cut and dry.
You can't be deceived.
You can't live a lie.
Cut and dry.
Part of the machine.
Victim of a scheme.
Cut and dry.
Victim of a scheme.
And you will be deceived.
Cut and dry.
A slave to the machine.
Cut and dry.
