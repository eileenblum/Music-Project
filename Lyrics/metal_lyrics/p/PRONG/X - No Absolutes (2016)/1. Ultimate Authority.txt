The consequences of the will of the right
Disharmony within the law of all life
Deserving everything that you are owed
Severity, a basic moral code

To view humanity with such a disgust
Unescaping the law of honesty and trust
The deluded non acceptance of reality
So unrelenting in your certainty
The Ultimate Authority
No exceptions to the rule

The consequences of the will of the right
Disharmony within the law of all life
The non acceptance of reality
Accept the ultimate authority
The consequences of the will of the right
Disharmony within the law of all life
The non acceptance of reality
Accept the ultimate authority
