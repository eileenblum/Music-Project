The will to survive.
Ever striving.
The will to succeed.
Forever climbing. Never arriving.
To fulfill my need.
There's no defeat.
There's no retreat.

A must to achieve.
No compromising.
Adjust and proceed.
Realigning, keep on thriving.
To fulfill my need.
Exceed, compete.

There's no defeat.
There's no defeat.
Something to believe in.
Something to believe in.
There's no retreat.
There's no retreat.
Something to believe in.

Ever striving.
Never arriving.
Realigning.
No compromising.

There's no defeat.
There's no retreat.
Something to believe in.

[Guitar solo]

The will to survive.
Ever striving.
Never arriving.
There's no defeat.
There's no defeat.
Something to believe in.
Something to believe in.
There's no retreat.
There's no retreat.
Something to believe in.
Something to believe in.
The will to survive.
The will to succeed.
A must to achieve.
Something to believe in.
