Not saddened by the many that can't do their part
Not wanting to have any obligations of any sort
To see it as a blessing never to defrost
Too many thieving and at all costs
Freeze.
I feel the ice run through my veins
And with a pain I can't ignore
I feel my eyes rip through my head
Like a cold black storm

With no compassion.
I feel the ice run through my veins
Unholy passion.
Correctness eventually will wane
With no compassion.
I feel the ice run through my veins
No false companions distracting
Entitled to maintain my claim.

Imagine disrespecting acting like I'm cursed?
Believing, securing what is false
Obliged to take advantage and chasing it all to my own right passage
I'm inclined to create some damage using it all to your disadvantage.
Freeze.
I feel the ice run through my veins
And with a pain I can't ignore
I feel my eyes rip through my head
Like a cold black storm

With no compassion.
I feel the ice run through my veins
Unholy passion.
Correctness eventually will wane.
With no compassion.
I feel the ice run through my veins
No false companions distracting
Entitled to maintain my claim.

Not saddened by the many,
Not wanting to have any
Not any disrespecting,
Not anything distracting
I take it as a blessing,
Not any of the thieving
I take it as a blessing
Not saddened by the many.

With no compassion.
I feel the ice run through my veins
Unholy passion.
Correctness eventually will wane.
With no compassion.
I feel the ice run through my veins
No false companions distracting
Entitled to maintain my claim.

I feel the ice run through my veins
I feel the ice run through my veins
I feel the ice
I feel the ice
I feel the ice run through my veins
