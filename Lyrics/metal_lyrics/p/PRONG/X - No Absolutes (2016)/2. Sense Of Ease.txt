There's never enough, you want more and more
Till everything just turns to dust.
There's nowhere to turn, you cry to the sky.
The earthly realm just turns to rust.
You want to avoid, you want to exploit.
You strive for your own sense of ease.
Try to ignore, the future in doubt.
The others that you want to please
Never, never enough. Your sense of ease you trust.
What did I hear when I was awake?
It turned into uncommon sense.
Somewhere between, hearing and feeling.
A Being that holds no pretense.
No rational thought, no presence of mind.
But I seem to hear it again.
It tells a story without any words.
Of Truth no one can understand.
You've got to admit. You have to decide. Your choice only.
You've got to submit. You have to divide. Your choice only.
Never, never enough. Your sense of ease you trust.
Never, never enough. Never, never, never, never enough.
You've got to admit. You have to decide. Your choice only.
You've got to submit. You have to divide. Your choice only.
Never, never enough. Your sense of ease you trust.
Never, never enough. Never, never, never, never enough.
You want to avoid, you want to exploit.
You strive for your own sense of ease.
Try to ignore, all the future in doubt.
The others that you want to please.
There's never enough, you want more and more.
Till everything just turns to dust.
There's nowhere to turn, you cry to the sky.
The earthly realm just turns to rust.
You've got to admit. You have to decide. Your choice only. Your choice only
You've got to submit. You have to decide. It's your choice only. Your choice only.
You've got to admit it. You have to decide. Your choice only. Your choice only.
