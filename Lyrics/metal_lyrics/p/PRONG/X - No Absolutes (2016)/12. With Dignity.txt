You know your system has its flaws
What you think is real is simply wrong
There's no control when in this realm
Surrender to what overwhelms

Well I know, what I don't see
Is worth pursuing.
Well I know, what I don't see
Can be all renewing
Fate, a perception of your ways
A dimension you can take
I've come to realize.
Fate is in me.
Wait, you can strengthen the display
Fourth dimension to partake.
I come to realize
Faith is in me.
Fate is in me.

You think the distance is too long.
Between the present and the dark
You cannot see into this place
But it's where everything is formed.

Fate, a perception of your ways
A dimension you can take
I've come to realize.
Fate is in me.
Wait, you can strengthen the display
Fourth dimension to partake.
I come to realize
Faith is in me.
Fate is in me.

Well I know what I don't see
Well I know what I don't see
Can be all renewing

[Guitar solo]

Fate, a perception of your ways
A dimension you can take
Faith is in me
Fate, a perception of your ways
A dimension you can take
I've come to realize.
Fate is in me.

Wait, you can strengthen the display
Faith is in me.
Fate is in me.
I've come to realize
Faith is in me.
Fate is in me.
Fate is in me.
Faith is in me.
Fate is in me.
