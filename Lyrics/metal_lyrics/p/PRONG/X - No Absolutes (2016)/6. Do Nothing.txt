Nothing is the answer
Do nothing with your passion.
The search for pleasure is a waste of your time.
If you like to be in danger, if you like the threat of cancer,
and if you want to be caught inside the hell of your mind.
In the search for some kind of happiness
With a quest to replace any loneliness
Be locked into the emptiness, do nothing at all.
Welcome to the world of unhappiness
Denied again, left in distress
Secure within the motionless
Do nothing at all.
Trusting in disaster
Running from surrender
You don't seem to remember, do I need to remind?
If you like to be in anger from all the dissatisfaction
Then you'll always be confined to a prison of fire.
In the search for some kind of happiness
With a quest to replace any loneliness
Be locked into the emptiness, do nothing at all.
Welcome to the world of unhappiness
Denied again, left in distress
Secure within the motionless
Do nothing at all.
Do nothing.

Your needs, disenchanting
The greed, disappointing
Desires will always let you down.
Do nothing!
Do nothing.
Do nothing.
Do nothing.
In the search for some kind of happiness
With a quest to replace any loneliness
Be locked into the emptiness, do nothing at all.
Welcome to the world of unhappiness
Denied again, left in distress
Secure within the motionless
Do nothing at all.
Do nothing.
