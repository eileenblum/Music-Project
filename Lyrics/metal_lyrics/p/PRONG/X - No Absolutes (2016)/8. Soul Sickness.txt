Looking for today, out of my mind.
Looking to repay.
Faking it today, doubting my mind.
Fading it away.

Suffer from my own soul sickness.
Discover that it's self inflicted.
Soul Sickness.

Questioning the day during the night.
Question disobey.
Thinking eats away. Eating me inside.
Things to throw away.

Suffer from my own soul sickness.
Discover that it's self inflicted.
Soul Sickness.
Uncover what always existed.
Losing all hope my business.
Soul Sickness.

Living your way and with false smiles.
Its just the time to cry.
Living your way and with false smiles.
Its just the time to cry.

[Guitar solo]

Looking for today, out of my mind.
Looking to repay.

Suffer from your own soul sickness.
Discover that it's self inflicted.
Soul Sickness.
Losing all hope your business.
Suffer from your own soul sickness.
Soul Sickness.
Soul Sickness.
Soul Sickness.
