You think that we have control all over body and soul.
So much we pretend to know to fill those holes,
Your sense of self to suppose. One more thought to oppose.
Concepts to condone to make us whole.
With all your designs and your dislikes
So self defined.
No absolutes for you to choose,
there is a truth inside of you.
What can you do?
What will you prove?
The answer: there's no absolutes.
You think you have to uphold a reputation alone.
To keep your status afloat. To learn the ropes.
So much shit to unload. So much junk to dispose.
Information to know.
All just for show.
With all your designs and your dislikes
So self defined.
No absolutes for you to choose,
there is a truth inside of you.
What can you do?
What will you prove?
The answers deep inside you.
No absolutes for you to choose,
there is a truth inside of you.
What can you do?
What will you prove?
The answer: there's no absolutes.
Something to stress about
There's nothing to think about
Another thing to lie about,
It's all about what you want
An issue of what you think you are
Placing blame more and more
Identity to rip apart...
No absolutes for you to choose,
there is a truth inside of you.
What can you do?
What will you prove?
The answers deep inside you.
No absolutes for you to choose,
there is a truth inside of you.
What can you do?
What will you prove?
The answers deep inside you.
No absolutes for you to choose,
there is a truth inside of you
What can you do?
What will you prove?
The answer: there's no absolutes.
