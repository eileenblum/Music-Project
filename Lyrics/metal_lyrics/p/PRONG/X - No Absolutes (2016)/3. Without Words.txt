Until the light takes us, when everything collides.
Until the light takes us.
Until the light takes us (until the light takes us)
With all the tension. And wrong intentions.
Consult with me in silence.
Without words, without words and false hope.
Consult with me in silence.
Without words, without words and false hope.
Until the light takes us, when entities combine.
Until the light takes us.
Until the light takes us (until the light takes us).
No apprehension, and no aggression.
Consult with me in silence.
Without words, without words and false hope.
Consult with me in silence.
Without words, without words and false hope.
Without words.
And false hope.
And false hope.
Until the light takes us, when everything collides.
Until the light takes us.
Until the light takes us.
Until the light takes us.
No apprehension, and no aggression.
Consult with me in silence.
Without words, without words and false hope.
Consult with me in silence.
Without words, without words and false hope.
Without words.
Without words.
And false hope.
Without words.
Without words.
And false hope.
Without words.
Without words.
And false hope.
