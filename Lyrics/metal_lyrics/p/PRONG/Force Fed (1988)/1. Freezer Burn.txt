[T. Victor]

FIRE IGNITES
THE COLD, MELTS DOWN TONIGHT
BURNS THE ICE
THE HEAT TURNS WHITE
INSTANT! FLASH FROZEN
NEVER THAWS IN TIME
FEELS SO EVER RIGID
CAN NOT CHOP IT DOWN
THEN STARTS SOME BOILING
POTENTIAL TO EXPIRE
HEATING FROM INSIDE
[REPEAT CHORUS]
SENSES TO BE RIGID
TEMPETURE CONTROLLED
LIMITS THERMAL INCREASE
CONTAINED TO THE MOLD
[REPEAT CHORUS]
CHILLED FOR A REASON
SCALDED BEYOND REASON
NOW YOU BURN WITH FIRE
REBORN FROM THE FIRE
[REPEAT CHORUS]
