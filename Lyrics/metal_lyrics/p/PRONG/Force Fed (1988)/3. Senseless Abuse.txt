[T. Victor-T. Parsons]

SICKENED BY THE ACTION
THE SENSELESS ABUSE
HATRED THE REACTION
NOW PUT IT TO USE!
THE TREATMENTS, THE TESTIMONY OF MOTIVES
STRATEGY, MANIPULATION, TORMENTED MINDS
MANEUVERS CAPITALIZE ON INNOCENCE
POWER WIELDING DEEDS CRUSHING MY HEAD
SICKENED BY THE ACTION
THE SENSELESS ABUSE
HATRED THE REACTION
NOW PUT IT TO USE!
EXPLOITIVE, REVENGEFUL RAGE EMERGING
STRUCK ARE HIDDEN CHORDS, STRICKEN BY THE CRIMES
SELF CONTROL AND CONSCIENCE NOW DORMANT
THE DARK URGE FULFILLED, THE ABUSE IS HERE TO STAY
[REPEAT CHORUS]
