[M. Kirkland-T. Parsons-T.Victor]

LOOK UP AT THE SUN
TURNING
ELEVEN THOUSAND DEGREES
BURNING THERES NO SIREN
NO FIREMEN
IS IT NIGHT OR DAY
NINETY THREE MILLION MILES AWAY
HE'S GOT A GUN
PULLED OUT FROM BEHIND
A THOUSAND MISTAKES
GENERALIZATIONS
HE WAS BEYOND REASON
HE FIRED THREE SHELLS
HE FIRED THREE SHELLS
HE FIRED THREE SHELLS
HE FIRED THREE SHELLS
HE FIRED THREE SHELLS
HE FIRED THREE SHELLS
HE FIRED THREE SHELLS
