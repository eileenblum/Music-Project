Rip your God
Fuck hopeless self
Anti love you hold dear
Douse yourself in evil
Thought repression of your fear
Darkness likes to toy with you
As you walk through the night
Pillage through your conscience mind
The epidural blight
Feeding my anguish
This life is born of pain
Deleted memory
This world's gone mad
Divine infection
