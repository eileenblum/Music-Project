Sanctioning the era of death
Force-fed deception
Still I hold my doubt
At the thought of human rule over earth
Understand impending overthrow assaults
Rebirth on the pawns within our society
The drones created of impurity
Lucidity corrupted by majority
Demanding our lives incessantly
Contradiction to the shrine of mutilation
Predeterminated fate annihilation
Scourge upon our souls irreligion
Malignant populace of visitation
Tyranny designed to immobilize
Subdued in a pit of self
Despite feeble to the throne of genocide
You can do nothing
Just demoralize
