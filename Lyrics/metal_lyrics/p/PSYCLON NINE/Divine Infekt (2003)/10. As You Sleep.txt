Cold
Blue
Lifeless
Deathless
Illuminated by the machines
That hold you on this side
Anger or tear
So calm
Unaffected I cease to live
I fear my infection
Watching over your soul as you sleep
Injecting nightmares as you sleep
All I want is you purity
All I want in this world is your mind
The timeless place tamed by your psyche
Living in the world of dreams
Always sleeping unlike the feigned
Peace brought by morphine
That lay discarded at my feet
I float in blackness
Wrench myself away
Down deserted hallways filled with erie light
The muted screams of the dying
Pierced my soul like a dull and rusted needle
As I stumble in my morphine hase Barely conscience of the predawn light
That filters through steel meshed windows
Keeping out your life
Reigning in your death
I stumble past the coated watchers
Break into a run
Yearning for the air outside
I never stop thinking of you
