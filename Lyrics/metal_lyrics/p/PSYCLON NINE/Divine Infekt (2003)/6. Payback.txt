Raging fury built inside
Hallowed point
Sick suicide
You can't see what dwells
Within these lies
Scripture leading to damnation
God forbidden retribution
Laced with hatred
Soul destruction
Bursting chests with each malfunction
Curved moist flesh
Lay on ground
Rotten your life
Your being now forgotten
Slaughtered for my love
Of bloodshed spattered body dead
Remain dead
