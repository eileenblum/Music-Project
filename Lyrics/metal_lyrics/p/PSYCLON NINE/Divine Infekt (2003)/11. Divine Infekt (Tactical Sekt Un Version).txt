(We all deserve a life in hell...) [4x]

(Hell, hell, hell, hell
We all deserve a life in hell) [4x]

Rip your God
Fuck hopeless self
Anti love you hold dear
Douse yourself in evil
Thought repressions of your fear
Darkness likes to toy with you
As you walk through the night
Pillage through your conscience mind
The epidural blight

Divine infekt
Divine infektion
[2x]
Divine infektion [2x]
Divine, divine,
Infektion, infektion

(Hell, hell, hell, hell
We all deserve a life in hell) [4x]

Rip your God
Fuck hopeless self
Anti love you hold dear
Douse yourself in evil
Thought repressions of your fear
Darkness likes to toy with you
As you walk through the night
Pillage through your conscience mind
The epidural blight
Feeding my anguish
This life is born of pain
Deleted memory
This world's gone mad

(Hell, hell, hell, hell
We all deserve a life in hell) [4x]

Rip your God
Fuck hopeless self
Anti love you hold dear
(We all deserve a life in hell)
Douse yourself in evil
Thought repressions of your fear
(We all deserve a life in hell)
Darkness likes to toy with you
As you walk through the night
Pillage through your conscience mind
The epidural blight
(We all deserve a life in hell)
Feeding my anguish
This life is born of pain
Deleted memory
This world's gone mad

Divine infekt
Divine infektion
Divine, divine
Infektion, infektion

(Hell, hell, hell, hell
We all deserve a life in hell) [5x]

(Life in hell) [to fade]
