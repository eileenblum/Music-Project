Promise brought down to nihil
Due to broken trust
It enrages me to slaughter
Necrophile experiences
What it is to fuck the dead deity
I have seen your end
Your hope was broken
Because of the lies you fed
Promises represent your lust
Ensuing dreams of a sky so red
Deity I have seen your end
Your hope was broken
Because of the lies you fed
