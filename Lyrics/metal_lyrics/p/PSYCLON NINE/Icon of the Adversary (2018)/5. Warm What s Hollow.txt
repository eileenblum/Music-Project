[Music and lyrics: Nero Bellum]

Throw your strings to the side little puppet

Discard all trace of design

Sit. Heel. Lay with me and lie to me

Show me something desperate, compel me with atrocity

Just breathe, breathe into me

And warm what's hollow

I II III IV V VI

I see the black in her eyes

I II III IV V VI

She holds a place

For the flies
