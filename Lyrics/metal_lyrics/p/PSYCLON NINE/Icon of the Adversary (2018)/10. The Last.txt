[Music and lyrics: Nero Bellum]

There must be something wrong with me

I can't seem to stop gnawing to feel like this

Buried beneath the remains of what once was

I can rebuild with the mud of our ashes, tears and blood

Will you lay me down

Will you close my eyes and say a prayer for me

Am I something more than selfish

Do I even deserve serenity

Everything I've touched has withered away

My adversary is inside myself

Press your lips into me

Erase the mistakes that I have made here
