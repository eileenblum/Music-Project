[Music and lyrics: Nero Bellum]

A Devil speaks through his new flesh (an icon)

The dead soul that's standing before you

They wear my eyes and they tell me what to see

They wear my mouth and they tell me just what to say

Let it be born to wear the crown of the worm

What it is, what it fucking shall be

They wear my face and they all scream ha ha heil

They'll put their faith in a new god
