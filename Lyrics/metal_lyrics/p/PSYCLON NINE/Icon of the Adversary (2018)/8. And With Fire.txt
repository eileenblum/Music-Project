[Music and lyrics: Nero Bellum]

I want you to make me sick

Dry up this little soul

I want to throw away everything

That makes me myself

I never asked to be here

Dispel the pageantry

Bury me alive in the

Shadows of your grace

All Hell wash over me

Wipe this slate clean

Bestow me with your emptiness

I want to wear your disease to warm this frailty

To lick the wounds that will never heal

Lay your eggs inside of me
