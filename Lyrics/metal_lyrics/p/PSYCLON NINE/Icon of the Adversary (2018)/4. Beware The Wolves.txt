[Music and lyrics: Nero Bellum]

Some they came to see an atrocity

Some they came to display

Some they came behind a veil of disguise

All seeking way to revelate
Come on the heels of who you'd caste down

As servant. The unwashed. The unworthy

Come on the heels of who serve no purpose to climb a ladder of their destitution

Beware the wolves

Don't you step in shadows where they can smell the fear in your veins

You can look but, you can't touch when it's so close

You can feel it in your fucking skin
