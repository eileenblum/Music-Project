[Music and lyrics: Nero Bellum]

Thy will be done and our Hell shall be on Earth

Like Father, like son: bathed in the light of Armageddon

Why can't you all just pray to me?

Complacency is their new disease

What won't be undone

What's written in their revelation

What salivates salvation

The gift of molestation
