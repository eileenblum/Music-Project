This is the end
The malice sealed with a kiss of bitterness
From the mouths defiled spoiled within the lifeless populace
Poisoning by way of rapturous tongue
The exit sign dressed in blades of razor,
The trigger of a loaded gun

Sanctified through suicide
Through bloodwork their world denied

(through bloodwork their world denied)

Pressing hard the cold steel on the warmness of flesh
Eviscerate match the wrists to your blackened, bloody knees
Bleed the disease 'til the lies are undone
The exit sign dressed in blades of razor,
The trigger of a loaded gun

Put the gun into your mouth and pull the fucking trigger
Press the blade against your throat and bleed the fucking cancer
