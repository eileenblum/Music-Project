We're just like the flowers
When our hearts are eclipsed
We will wilt in the shadow
Watch us blackened our own eyes
So we'll never have to see the truth

Do you have love for me or the devils inside?
Or will I always just be the last one in line?
The world becomes as debris as I've been cast aside
With their eyes fixed upon
The stars that fell from the sky

Cradled in her hands
The world is awaiting her answer
Can we suffer through the abuse the abuse the pain
The pain and affliction?
Or will this be the end of our time?

Do you have love for me or the devils inside?
Or will I always just be the last one in line?
The world becomes as debris as I've been cast aside
With their eyes fixed upon
The stars that fell from the sky

I can end this tonight
I can end this tonight
I can end this fucking life
This fucking life

I gave you my heart, gave you the knife
And this heart still bleeds
