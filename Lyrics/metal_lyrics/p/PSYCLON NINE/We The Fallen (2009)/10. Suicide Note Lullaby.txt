Never again
The smell of smoke it fills your lungs
Never again
Choking on the fear of darkness falls
Never to be held, never to be free
Never hear what they say and never fall for me
One last kiss to satiate
Ten thousand times is not enough
Closing thine eyes
Lost in crimson
Trapped in all I despise
It's fucking broken
I never stop hearing the cries

I found my savior in these shards of shattered glass
I am an exit to the blackness this is my last hymn
To the fallen not again to touch the sky
A suicide not lullaby

Never again
Everyday we drown in agony
Never again
To taste the sickly sweet of decay
When you're laying on the ground just remember to
Breathe, just breathe, just breathe, just breathe

One last kiss to satiate
Ten thousand times is not enough
Closing thine eyes
Lost in crimson
Trapped in all I despise
It's fucking broken
I never stop hearing the cries

I found my savior in these shards of shattered glass
I am an exit to the blackness this is my last hymn
To the fallen not again to touch the sky
A suicide not lullaby

I found my savior in these shards of shattered glass
I am an exit to the blackness this is my last hymn
To the fallen not again to touch the sky
A suicide not lullaby
