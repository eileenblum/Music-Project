Crowned with deception and holocaust eyes
Speaking through fear and exalting the light
Doctrine of blackness becoming as lie
Carnality as disease is denied

I am the one, the fallen angel, the gun
I am the end, the derelict forsaken

The light at the end of the tunnel burnt out
The failure turns heartache in he most devout
Fascism becomes as democracy
The fire, the flame it becomes as debris

I am the one, the fallen angel, the gun
I am the end, the derelict forsaken

God forsaken

(tears into spirals from this mortal coil, the needle as Christ begs us all to be loyal)
