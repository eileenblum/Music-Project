We are sitting on the throne of contamination
Dead, dying, diseased, hid in the shadow
Under the crown of silence and ruination
Never you mind, just find the exit
(never to see, never to breathe)
Just follow the signs into the emptiness
Blacken your eyes to the light of revelation

There out for the grace of god go he with the hammer and nails
There out for the grace of god go he so that man can prevail
There out for the grace of god the doctors brooding over lifeless remains
There out for the grace of god pump his heart 'til he's breathing again

Pump his heart, reverse his demise
Pulled from the cross to unblacken our eyes
Crossing our hearts, hoping to die
Insert the needle to extinguish our cries
Our Mary of spades elate us with desire
(never to see, never to breathe)
Subdued in a pit of insipid dreaming
Calm us when we seethe

There out for the grace of god go he with the hammer and nails
There out for the grace of god go he so that man can prevail
There out for the grace of god the doctors brooding over lifeless remains
There out for the grace of god pump his heart 'til he's breathing again
