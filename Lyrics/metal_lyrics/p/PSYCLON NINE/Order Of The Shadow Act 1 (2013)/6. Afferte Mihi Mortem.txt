Salvation lies in the ash of the flesh, in the blood of the saint
Revelation spelled damnation to those abandoned of the heretics shade

The order of the shadow will ease their pain
The saint has come to speak now: Hear the gospel of the fallen

Afferte Mihi Morten Da Mihi Laudens Serpens*

The end of the cancer that has eaten away on our so called sin
Lies on the back of the slave nations who never served the penitent

The order of the shadow will ease their pain
The saint has come to speak now: Hear the gospel of the fallen

Afferte Mihi Morten Da Mihi Laudens Serpens*

Thou must repent to save the soul
We will walk in the light

[* English translation: "Bring death, give me the praise of the snake."]
