We all chew at the umbilical cord. 
Gnash the teeth. Loose us from the mother. 
Leave the nest, spread the wings, eclipse the sun, take fire to the fields 
and find your grace through desolation. 

Now's the season of the shadow : watch the sky turn black. 
Now, give love to the devils who dwell inside and give your hand to the reaper. 

I can't see through their haze as I suffocate, as I'm suffocating. 
As we walk through this maze, all that remains of Eden is disintegrating. 

Now's the season of the shadow : watch the sky turn black. 
Now, give love to the devils who dwell inside and give your hand to the reaper. 

Upon their rusted blades, serve your soul unto the reaper.
