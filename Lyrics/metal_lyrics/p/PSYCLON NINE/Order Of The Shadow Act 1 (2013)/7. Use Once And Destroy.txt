[2x]
Defile me
She'll say and she'll scream
Defile me
From untouched to unclean

Just a pretty little whore
Fucking used up so dirty, so filthy, so sore
They say discard after use
What's it worth when it's laying in the gutter from the abuse

It's drunken on the blood of the saints
The souls of all your saviours
Surely run through its veins

Shedding skin, giving all 'til it's gone
A feather for a lover 'til it's stripped and left for carrion

[2x]
Defile me
She'll say and she'll scream
Defile me
From untouched to unclean

It looks just like you're praying from so low down on your knees
A kiss from the wretched maw filled to the brim with their impurities
Were their love for the worthless we would only be here just to appease
Praising to the angels call, to the devils fall, to the harlots disease

Just a pretty little whore
Fucking used up so dirty, so filthy, so sore
They say discard after use
What's it worth when it's laying in the gutter from the abuse

It's drunken on the blood of the saints
The souls of all your saviours
Surely run through its veins

Shedding skin, giving all 'til it's gone
A feather for a lover 'til it's stripped and left for carrion

[4x]
Defile me
She'll say and she'll scream
Defile me
From untouched to unclean
