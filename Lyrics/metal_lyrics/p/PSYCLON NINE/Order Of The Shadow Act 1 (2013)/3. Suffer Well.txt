You think you can see into me
But there's nothing here
You think there's more to this life
But there's nothing but fear
Soulless hopeless empty dreams
Of genocide
But, if we can't kill them all
We can settle for suicide

I'll be the first one to see
I'll hold this gun up to me. To me
Cross my heart and close my eyes
Open to see a world gone black of me

Suffer for me
Suffer well
We'll suffer 'til we burn in hell

If we can't stop, we can grace 
Disease with a crown
Slit our throats to have a window 
And watch the pills go down
A halo from the needle
Ashen wings of amphetamine
Grant me the heart, this soul is too dirty

We can play with suicide
We can set our sin aside
Just hold my hand and close those eyes
They'll find the constellations in the mist
Of our blood and our tears

We can watch this world
Burn through
The eyes of the dead
