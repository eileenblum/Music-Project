He said: "I'll take it all
Give me grandeur and the stars as they fall
Give me heaven as, the angels they call
To me from above and they wisper "you're eternal""

We've been marked, we've been chosen by our martyrs
We hide the absence of our halos as they shatter
Ready on the broken wings of our sires
Give up life for glory in the cinders of our blackened wake

They'll hold me close
And wash away the sin
And the soil
Caress my soul with compassion
And light the path to immortality

Hold me close to your flame
I need to feel you pain
And in my absence they'll send an angel your way
As the light fades from my eyes
Don't you cry, they're here for me
Just take my hand while I take my fucking life
