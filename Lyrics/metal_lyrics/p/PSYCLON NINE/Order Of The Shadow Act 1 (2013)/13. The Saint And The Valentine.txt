I can't remember what it means to be alive 
will you show me? will you show me how to get inside? 
I can't remember what it means to sacrifice 
when I can't even feel the pain when I've been so anesthetized. 

No, I don't mean anything 
Nothing to the divine 
As I lay my heart before you 
I burn in the shadow of the saint and the valentine 

Kiss the cold and the dark, 
and say goodnight to the memories 
The ghost of a yesterday 
will hold you close to keep the hurt at bay 

As our time transpired 
we became as effigies 
underneath a veil of grey 
collapsing in on our own decay
