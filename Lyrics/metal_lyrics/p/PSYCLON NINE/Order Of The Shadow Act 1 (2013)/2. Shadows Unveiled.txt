The weight of our sin 
tips the scales of the famine 
Give plague to our our world 
bestow upon us molestation 
As slaves to the anguish 
and bound to our desecration 
We kiss in dark corners 
the mouths of annihilation 

The shadows unveiled as archangel 
Upon us they grace us the words âWe are of perditionâ 
Opening of the seven seals 
Our shadows will call thy name: 
âWe are the fire and flameâ 

Fall into the shadows cast 
by the crown of degradation 
Rise in abandon of the flesh 
that screamed with imperfection 
The furies of this living hell 
still hold us close in adulation 
No more tears from dying eyes 
as the flies descend to consume us from the skies 

We will sing the serpents song 
and dance in their inferno 
Watch the heavens burn 
their angelsâ ash will fall as snow 
The skies will crack 
The earth gives way 
The seas will swallow 
their love and light will be eclipsed by our orders shadow
