The cross that feeds on your mind
I've seen the lies that reflect in your eyes
It's just a matter of time
From holy scriptures unfurl twisted lines
And when you die the cause will be from self infliction
Your pointless life will only lead to crucifixion
He wasn't there
He won't be there to wipe the tears from your eyes
Your wasted breath has betrayed you
The peace you sought
You'll never find through prayer
And through his hatred divine
You left your whole life behind you
