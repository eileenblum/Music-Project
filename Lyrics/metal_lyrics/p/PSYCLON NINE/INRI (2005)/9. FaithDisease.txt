Faith, disease
My right to end your life
We see the lie behind the light
Droves of human waste
Darkened by their own depression
We serve ourselves defy the word of God
Free will is the key to salvation
Look to the heavens to see the sky burnt black
Look to the end where time is turning back
You're left with nothing and your eyes are empty
Your path is death and your faith's a disease
Your faith bleeds on a broken cross
Your faith will only bring you loss
Your faith bears to great a cost
Through his righteousness the earth defiled
