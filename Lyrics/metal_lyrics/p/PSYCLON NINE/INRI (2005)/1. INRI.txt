Why should I believe if God's not here to save me? [4x]

Condemned by our lord and our savior
I know now that I'm the son of no man
Knowing of the traps you've set for me
Why should I even try to save myself?

Oh father, yes father
For you I'll have this world on its knees
Oh father, yes father
For you I'll spread their legs like disease

[Revelation 13 (King James):]
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
