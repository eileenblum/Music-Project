Generations past counting days till the final time
Beaten down now the meek are mighty
The shattered seal ensures the bitter end
Now that the world is gone
My eyes will see that nothings left
But their blood choked cries
Wait for the time to come
The angel ends their feeble lives
Hopeless dreams death unfurls
Watch, you'll see
I'll rape this world
