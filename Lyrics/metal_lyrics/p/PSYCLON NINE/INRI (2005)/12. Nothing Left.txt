As we fall, our descent will be through our darkest dreams
Our reflections, just a memory of our lives past
See the world standing still through blood stained glass
You know that the pain won't subside when you're so weak
Embrace the cold breath of truth
And we won't be in this world
To hear the cries of the feeble or the meek
Inside the nothingness
Floods with insecurity
We're burning from within for something we can't reach
And in the end there's nothing left
This stagnant world is at an end
The mirror questions our worth every day
And we can't live up to it's expectations
Fills us with the hope of dreams that we can't live up to
Inside the nothingness floods with insecurity
And I'm burning from within for something I can't reach
And in the end there's nothing left for me
