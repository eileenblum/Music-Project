I the watchful eye
I am the butterfly
You know you never heard me screaming

I am the question why
I am the butterfly
Mister mojo can you hear me screaming
Hey Jude you look just like your daddy
I know how it feels it makes me sad
He won't sing to me anymore
If you and me shake them
Do you think we could wake them
Do you think we could try
For most of my life I never could thank them
For the purple hazed experience
Of the electric lady's voodoo child
Yes they were bold as love
Just ask the axis

Get me through these tired day
Get me through
I've seen really nothing that your really threw away
I just see it as if you've gone all the way with it
Gone all the way with it

As if to die
So that you may really live on forever
So fly, fly on my little heartbreak
I'm gonna catch the falling feathers from your wing
Ah yes fly on my little heartbreak
Now I am the acid king

Do you think they could look down and see me now
Do you think they would dig the way I sound
Do you think they'd even care

I am forever I
I am the butterfly
Close to the ground brings no further the sky
I am forever
Close to the ground brings no further the sky
I am forever
Close to the ground brings no further the sky
I am the butterfly
