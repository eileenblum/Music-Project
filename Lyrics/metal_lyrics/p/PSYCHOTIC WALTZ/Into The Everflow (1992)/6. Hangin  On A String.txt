Riding on an endless carousel of wishes, hopes and dreams
And it seems that I loose more than I gain
All the same I remain hanging on a string
Is it wrong
Will it save me from the fall
Or will it just be broken by the wind
As it spins
All I save seems to just get taken all away

Well it seems like life is just a game of faith
No mistake
Always try to give more than you take
Always try to make a little more
Out of nothing, if not less
Always better than your best

As you try
Will you fly
Will you sail through the sky
And leave it all behind with yesterday
Will you say I have faith
And that's one thing they'll never take away

If I had a chance, lord one more chance to try
I would start again, nothing to pretend
Without a lie

I would try
I would fly
I would sail through the sky
And leave the misery with yesterday
And I'll say I have faith
And that's one thing they'll never take away
