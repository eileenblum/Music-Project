Yesterday I gazed into the sky
Stared into the sun
The stars up high
Somehow fell into my eye
And then they'd fade away

Father of oblivion
Take me out of this place
This is a world of despair
Their meager grasps at simplicity
Promise a peace that will never be

Somehow the vision faded away
Somehow the decision
Turned and walked the other way
A little taste of glory
A pocket of fame
I guess the song that's in my head
Really don't remain the same

Bring the dawn, bring on
Bring the day
Sing it long, won't you sing on
It's just a state of mind away

Bringer of the bird song
Color the gray
Let the rain onto my head
Let it wash it all away
Sleeping through the darkness
Dreaming of the day
Where purple rain an sugarcane
Let me know I'm on my way

Into a dream I was flying
Feeling like I'd been chased away
I took to the air like an angel in flight
To the sky of another day

I had a dream I was dying
Feeling like I'd been chased away
I took to the air like an angel in flight
To the sky another day

I had a dream I was dying
Shot me in the head I felt no pain
I just remember I was waiting for something
Something that never really came
