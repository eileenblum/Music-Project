Crawling into my head, mosquito, mosquito red
Pieces, diseases, floating in the greases, but they smile instead

Sting of the suckerfly
In the dead of the night
Ride on the wings of a dragonfly
Sleep by the candlelight
Sucking the gutter dry
Taking flight
Now they dance on the open eye
Pushing the needle to the tiny bite

Watching the circling sun, mosquito, mosquito run
Vision of a killing gun
They sing with the voices of the angels son

River is flowing
The bloody wind is blowing
The reaper they are sowing
And I don't believe that they are going

Crawling into my eye, mosquito, mosquito fly
Falling from the scientist slide
Eating at the walls from behind they hide
