Locked down, locked it tight
You better wrap it tight around, you better lock it by midnight
Look down you better hit the ground
You're gonna shake it and move it
'till the world is just a big round city
Look out today, when the bullet flies
You better hide, you better pray
Get out, get out while you can
Better lock it down, better lock it down, lock it man

Cause we're gonna break the chain

Shot down, laying cold to the ground
Just another dead, bang! just another two walk around
This town is burning down with a cold from the inside
The blood of suicide
The word "respect" lets you hide
If you ride your pride you're justified
Time flies by, you'll ride you're high
And the life that you try is just another damn drive by

Locked down, lock it tight
You better wrap it round again
You better lock it before the night
Look down, hit the ground
We're gonna shake it and move it
'till the man has been knocked down
Look out today, when the bullet fly you're gonna die
You're gonna pay
Get out, get out while you can
Better lock it down, better lock it down, lock it man
