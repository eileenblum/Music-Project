Well it's only time
When the sun shines let your bullets fly like rain
Let 'em fly, let 'em fly like rain

Well it's only time
I can?t taste the morning
When the rays of the killing sun won't shine
Blue as the wind, blew it all, blew it all the time

I see the sky burning red
Burning inside of you
So let it rain down hard
Let it break on through

I see your world, I see your sees
And I know what's going to be left
When you leave what you leave for me
You'll be pulling me down

Don't lay down when the sun shines
