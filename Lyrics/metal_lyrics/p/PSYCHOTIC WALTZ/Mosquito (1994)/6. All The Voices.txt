Follow me into the sun
They're calling me into the sun
Flow through the air, will you follow me there
Follow me into the sun

All of my friends will be with me again
Follow me into the sun

Follow me into the day
Won't you follow me into the day
Running our hands through the silica sands
Only a daydream away

All of my friends will be with me again
Follow me into the day

Open the eyes of your mind
Won't you open the eyes of your mind
All of my friends will be with me again
Follow me into the blind

Follow me into the sun
They're calling me into the sun
Flow through the air, will you follow me there
Follow me into the sun

All of my friends will be with me again
No need to live under the gun

I feel so many voices
All the voices
