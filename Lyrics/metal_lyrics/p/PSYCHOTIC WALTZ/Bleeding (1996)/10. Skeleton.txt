digging in through the crypt inside my mind
echoes of a hollow prayer of the unknown
diggin' up the bones
diggin up the bones
we're gonna dig up the bones
ghetto of my soul is a skeleton
chaining down the ghost of my mind

I am a psychedelic gray
a screaming skeleton
I fall into the sinkhole of my grave
we're all bleeding 
you know that we're all bleeding
god come on begin the dawn that we bleed again
diggin' up the bones
diggin up the bones
we're gonna dig up the bones
ghetto of my soul is a skeleton
chaining down the ghost of my mind

locked inside the cage of a skeleton
I'm a wasted mind of space and time
I'm a ghost in chains
float the plains among the living
rise from the remains
to be gone
diggin' up the bones
diggin up the bones
we're gonna dig up the bones
ghetto of my soul is a skeleton
chaining down the ghost of my mind
locked inside the cage of a skeleton
I'm a wasted mind of space and time
ride on . . .
