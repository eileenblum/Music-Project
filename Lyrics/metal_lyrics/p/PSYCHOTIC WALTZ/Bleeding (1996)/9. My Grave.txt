they're cracking the cross where they hammer the nail
pennies they laid on the windows that failed
not really gone, but I'm so far away
all of your prayers cried at once all too late
once you fall down, end the round
end the round

shades of my dark hour light where I lay
someone I don't know is passing my way
don't want to go, but I can't really stay
now I wait for this no one to take me away

given to the ground
end the round
tears are falling down
given to the ground
end the round

drums of the death marchers 
drone through the day
the funeral flowers macabre disarray
fall to the tears and the dirt where they lay
now they've all come at once
and they've all come too late
given to the ground
end the round, end the round
end the round, end the round
end the round, end the round now
end the round, end the round
end the round
