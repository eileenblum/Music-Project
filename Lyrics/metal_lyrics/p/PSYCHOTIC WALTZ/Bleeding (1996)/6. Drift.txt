slow it down, turn around
rain again forever
drift on my way
lift my soul through the overgrow

stone my soul down below
serenade the dying
cold blind grave, midnight shade
death embrace this evening
drift on my way, drift on my way
drift away. . .

bells of dawn turn you on
can you hear them ringing?
birds of song flying on
can you hear them singing?
drift on my way, drift on my way
now I drift on my way, drift on my way
drift away. . .
