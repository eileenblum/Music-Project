needing, feeling alone
light never seems to shine
hiding under a stone
now I understand that deep inside
you need to make me feel

something inside her
she's closing the door
screaming inside her smile
she don't cry anymore

feeling her prayer, breathing her pain
dreaming her tears gone by
now she's out of the rain
now I understand that deep inside
you need to make me feel

words fly like missiles
they're flying on now
. . . rest your mind, rest your mind . . .

your lips destroy like missiles
your whispers fly
your whispers fly like missiles
your lips destroy
words fly like missiles
they're flying on now
