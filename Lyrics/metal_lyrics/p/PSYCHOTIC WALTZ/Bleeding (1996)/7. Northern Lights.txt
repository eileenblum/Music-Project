laughing at the city freaks
a carnival of gimps and tweaks
dogs are hungry for the meat
they drag it screaming through the street
everybody passing by 
afraid to look them in the eye
corner dealer selling while I tell him 
I don't want to buy

one night of calm, through the Netherlands
to northern lights and incense surrounding again
now we are coming, Amsterdam will bring
northern lights and incense again

wait at the corner for a white electric caterpillar ride take us to the
other side
(where the Katsu and the Old Man hide)
flying through the cloudy day 
feeling like I'm far away
nothing like a sky of gray to keep me feeling in my way

one night of calm, through the Netherlands
to northern lights and incense surrounding again
now we are coming, Amsterdam will bring
northern lights and incense again

one night of calm, through the Netherlands
to northern lights and incense surrounding again
now we are coming, Amsterdam will bring
northern lights and incense again

can you see the city lights chase the shadows from the night?
(still the ember burning bright)
now we never pass it to the right
the stars are in the sky another color in my eye
feeling happy, feeling high
(feeling like I'm still alive)
