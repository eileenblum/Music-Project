people can you feel anymore?
look through the keyhole, listen at the door
can you see? can you see?

freedom is blowing away
by the wind that flies your flag
the pride of yesterday
people can you breathe anymore?
do you remember what you're fighting for?
are you free? can you be?
are you free? can you see?

can you feel my soul?
can you feel?
can you feel the quiet cold?

are you free? can you be?
are you free? can you see?

now I drift so far away
will you close the door behind?
we'll fly where the sun will shine
alone and free, to go where we'll never be . . .
