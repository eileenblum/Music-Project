Alone in the dark,
looking out for love,
Geared up to pay the price,
for a breath of life.

With the taste of blood,
in our avid mouth,
Like a repentant sinner,
are crawling on all fours.

Hear the voice of revolution,
We provoke the opposition.

[Chorus (2x):]
We are you nightmare,
With our voices in the night,
And in your bad dreams,
We are the creatures of the night.

Tainted love is our first desire,
For dirty love and dirty games,
we always pay for the game.

Who is the fool and who is it not,
'cause the one with the smiling face,
isn't the absolute winner
when he is losing the race.

Hear the voice of revolution
We provoke the opposition

[Chorus (2x)]
