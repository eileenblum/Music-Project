Hear the voice,
follow the leaning of your heart,
Hold onto yourself.

I feel the power, I trust in myself,
I don't pay attention to the words you say.
Will of iron will lead me to my destination,
It's time to strike out in a new direction.

I realized to pave the way
Don't lead me astray

I believe, I believe in me
You believe, not in me
Your world is not mine

I believe, I believe in me
You believe, not in me
Your world is not mine

I lost many years, my youth is gone.
Dwarfed by you, I miss my identity.
Caught in a freak show, with a monster inside.
It's time to rebel to find my personality.

I realized to pave the way
Don't lead me astray

I believe, I believe in me
You believe, not in me
Your world is not mine
I believe, I believe in me
You believe, not in me
Your world in not mine

Follow the leaning of your heart
Listen ...

I believe, I believe in me
You believe, not in me
Your world is not, not mine
I realized to pave the way
Stand up, for what you believe
I believe in me
