Signs in the sand
Not written forever
On a stony way
Time has come
To let us go

In every minute of our life,
we hold on to what we believe
The past and the future,
the days and the years,
we're not forever!

With every heartbeat we are one,
released from pain
and our spirit will never die.

Signs in the sand
Not written forever
On a stony way
Time has come
To let us go

Sacrificed your days again.
Wasting your time, you're always losing,
Precious moments have gone by,
we are lost in a battle.

With every heartbeat we are one,
released from pain
and our spirit will never die

Signs in the sand
Not written forever
On a stony way
Time has come
To let us go
