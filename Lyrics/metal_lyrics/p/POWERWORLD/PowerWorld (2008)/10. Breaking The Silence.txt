Into the light, we bring this human race,
Out of the darkness, to find the right way.

Every culture and different nations,
we all are God's creation.
For all who think they are different,
it's not true, take care of your treatment,
Don't ignore the variation of our existence.

In the darkness we open the gate.
With leading angels we trust our fate

Breaking the silence,
and show us the way.
Give us a sign
And lead us away

Breaking the silence,
We don't wanna stay.
Send us a message
and lead us one day.

Life is not a sports competition.
Give your surroundings more attention.
During the game, what is more than policy confrontation,
selling war as holy.

Respect other countries and religions,
Don't paint a prophet in a publication,
Otherwise count with their rage and hate,
and hate, and hate, and fury.

Out in the cold, we trust our fate.
With leading angels we open every gate.

Into the light, we bring this human race,
out of the darkness to find the right way.
In afterlife, there is no difference
between colour, religion and our way of life.

Into the light, we bring this human race,
out of the darkness to find the right way
In afterlife, we are only memory,
remembered by our loved ones
and our family.
