Out in the cold,
you stand on your own.
See the danger that surrounds you,
the darkness is all around.

The shadow falls,
it's night in the town,
Freedom for you.

Don't trust anyone,
try to make it on your own,
Heaven for you.

Reach out for the good things,
don't waste your life.

Cry out all your fear,
You're still alive,
Don't trust the evil might.

Feel the fire,
that burns in your soul,
take care of yourself,
Don't walk on broken glass.

Souls for hire,
this is not heaven,
under neon lights,
Don't walk on broken glass.

Help, no one can help,
no one can catch,
when you are falling.

Deep down in the web,
that's made of pain,
With tears of sorrow.

Crawl out of the swamp,
of evil, be free.

Cry out all your fear.
Don't hesitate,
Now kill the evil might.
