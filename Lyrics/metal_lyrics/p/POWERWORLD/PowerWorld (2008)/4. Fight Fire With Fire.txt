I sacrificed my love in an easy drunken night
I lost my way and nothing was right

Head over heels, I fall in love again
Covered by a smoke screen, I forget my name!

Falling in the deep.

Why don't you realize
It's time to pay the price
before the price gets higher
Don't fight fire with fire

Obey the advice
Why don't you realize
You are caught by fire
And the price gets higher and higher

My passion changes my life from white to black
nothing was the same, after this attack.
I know, I did something wrong,
but father forgive me, I know what I have done

We are not in paradise,
Welcome to my shameful vice.

Falling in the deep.

Why don't you realize
It's time to pay the price
Before the price gets higher
Don't fight fire with fire

Obey the advice
Why don't you realize
You are caught by fire
And the price gets higher and higher
