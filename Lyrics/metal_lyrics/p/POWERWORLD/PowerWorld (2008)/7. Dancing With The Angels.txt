My heart broke into pieces
when I heard you were dead.
After a painful life
you left us behind.
But we always keep you in mind.

I remember the last time,
when we talked and we joked.
You showed me your music
and your cat got stroked.
You filled the room with your smile!

There is a place for golden hearts,
I'm sure you are there.
You're dancing with the angels,
and your spirit is always here.

The fight is over, you are free my friend,
You're dancing with the angels
and we will never forget you.

Brave and strong
should we stay when we are living.
No time for mercy,
we don't pray for our ending.

Here we come like the wind and the rain.

Take my hand
and walk through the stars.
Don't be afraid,
don't care about the darkness.

Our love always the way.

There is a place for golden hearts,
I'm sure you are there.
You're dancing with the angels,
and your spirit is always here.
The fight is over, you are free my friend.
You're dancing with the angels
and we love you till the end.

The fight is over, you are free my friend.
You're dancing with the angels
and we will never forget you.

There is a place for golden hearts,
I'm sure you are there.
You're dancing with the angels,
and your spirit is always here.
There fight is over, you are free my friend.
You're dancing with the angels
and we will never forget you.
Always love you,
never forget you, always love you!
