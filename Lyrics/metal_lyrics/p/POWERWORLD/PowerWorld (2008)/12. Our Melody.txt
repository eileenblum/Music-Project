I'm standing alone against the time,
all that we have done was only a try.
I had been thinking about you and me everyday,
and the things we tried to realize.

We are at a turning point,
don't forget the time.

We reach for the stars
please give me your hand
and sing our melody.

Fight our love shall survive,
you're always mine
with our melody.

Dry your eyes and watch your step,
you could lose your feeling,
Don't follow the ghost in your heart,
let me be your healing.

We should start another game,
before you forget my name!

We reach for the stars
please give me your hand
and sing our melody.

Fight our love shall survive,
you're always mine
with our melody.
