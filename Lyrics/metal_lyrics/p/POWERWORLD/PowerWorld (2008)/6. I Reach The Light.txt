The light that I see,
could be real or fantasy
All that I feel is too much,
I cannot breathe.
To find a way,
I look into the darkness,
and I find a light,
that leads me into life.

My tear-filled eyes are wide open
to see the leading sign.
I see a helping hand, that brings me into life.

Mother forgive me,
I free myself.
I'm looking straight ahead
to reach the light.

The power of life,
touched my soul.
With your blood in my veins,
I reach the light.

I'm born into this world,
and I don't know what's coming now.
Should I trust or should I fear,
how long will I stay?

This is a never ending circle,
this gathering has begun,
I take part of this game,
till the end of the day.

I know it's not forever,
my visit on earth,
I see a helping hand, that brings me into life.

Mother forgive me,
I free myself.
I'm looking straight ahead,
I reach the light.

The power of life,
touched my soul,
With your blood in my veins,
I reach the light.
