[Verse 1:]
Feeling cold and bored inside,
there is no meaning got to loosen the ties.
Open heart and open mind,
true believing with no compromise.

[Pre-chorus:]
Iâve been searching, wasting all my time,
just to see.
Iâve been dreaming, walking through the fire,
burning down inside.
This time I know the meaning, emotional healing.

[Chorus:]
Iâm cleansed by fire.
Cleansed by fire.

[Verse 2:]
Blinded by your sweet disguise,
I have lost myself living a lie.
Stuck somewhere I donât belong,
never seen whatâs been going on.

[Pre-chorus:]
Iâve been searching, wasting all my time,
just to see.
Iâve been dreaming, walking through the fire,
burning down inside.
I see my wounds are healing, never stop believing.

[Chorus:]
Iâm cleansed by fire.
Cleansed by fire.

[Repeat]

[Solo]

Cleansed by fire.

[Pre-chorus:]
Iâve been searching, wasting all my time,
just to see.
Iâve been dreaming, walking through the fire,
burning down inside.
This time I know the meaning, emotional healing.

[Chorus:]
Iâm cleansed by fire.
Fire.
Oh, fire.
Iâm cleansed by fire.

Ending:
Iâve been searching â wasting all my time.
Iâve been dreaming.
Oh yes I am.
Iâm cleansed by fire.
