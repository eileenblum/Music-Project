[Verse 1:]
I sit around and know I waste my time,
thinking about life all day long.
Thinking about all the secrets behind,
somehow my mind can't achieve it.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do we live in reality,
or is it just an illusion.
Are we the one we claim to be,
or just a divine confusion.

[Chorus:]
Might of secrets,
the truth lies right behind.
Might of secrets,
beyond the hands of time.

[Verse 2:]
Searching for answers in the circle of life,
with moments of passion and desire.
A lifetime of mystery,
lost in a daily masquerade.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do we follow the right way,
or is it the road to nowhere.
So many answers left untold,
where do we go from here.

[Chorus:]
Might of secrets,
the truth lies right behind.
Might of secrets,
beyond the hands of time.

[Repeat]

[Bridge:]
Something out there, bigger than life,
flaming deep in our hearts.
Waiting down inside to be found.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Do we live in reality,
or is it just an illusion.
Are we the one we claim to be,
or just a divine confusion.

[Chorus:]
Might of secrets,
the truth lies right behind.
Might of secrets,
beyond the hands of time.

[Repeat]
