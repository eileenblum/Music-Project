[Verse 1:]
Standing on the edge of life,
remembering all the days.
I was glad to have you by my side,
you took my sorrows away.

I looked hard into the mirror,
and threw water in my face.
My memories won't fade away,
surround me in this empty space.

[Chorus:]
Lonely angel,
cries for love.
Sweet little angel,
cries the tears of the world.

[Verse 2:]
If love can hurt,
Iâm the bleeding one.
As time goes by,
IÂ´m trapped in the deep.

Heaven knows my disease,
released from a tangled heart.
I never want to hurt you,
I donât know what I have done.

[Pre-chorus:]
Forgive me the fights in our life,
I was not fair to you.

[Chorus:]
Lonely angel,
cries for love.
Sweet little angel,
cries the tears of the world.

[Repeat]

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus:]
Forgive me the fights in our life,
I was not fair to you.

[Chorus:]
Lonely angel,
cries for love.
Sweet little angel,
It hurt so much to hurt you.

Lonely angel,
cries for love.
Sweet little angel.
