[Verse 1:]
One step forward closer to the edge,
hired to find more souls to catch.
Ruthless people trying to find,
easy money with the human kind.

[Verse 2:]
Manipulation rules society,
by people with no identity.
Self-pleased and lost in their head,
they believe in everything they said.

[Pre-chorus:]
Freedom is a lie,
Demons in your mind.

[Chorus:]
Go down in flames.
Nothing but lies.
from the HUMAN PARASITE.
Drives you insane.
Free your mind.
From the HUMAN PARASITE.

[Verse 3:]
Brother killed brother all in vain,
I want to know just whoâs to blame.
Itâs time to try to put out the blaze,
too late to try to clear the haze.

[Pre-chorus:]
Freedom is a lie,
Demons in your mind.

[Chorus:]
Go down in flames.
Nothing but lies.
from the HUMAN PARASITE.
Drives you insane.
Free your mind.
From the HUMAN PARASITE.

[Repeat]

[Bridge:]
We accrete us,
We are ashamed.
We are not dignified.
We bear the blame.

[Solo]

[Verse 4:]
One step forward closer to the edge,
hired to find more souls to catch.
Ruthless people trying to find,
easy money with the human kind.

[Pre-chorus:]
Freedom is a lie,
Demons in your mind.

[Chorus:]
Go down in flames.
Nothing but lies.
from the HUMAN PARASITE.
Drives you insane.
Free your mind.
From the HUMAN PARASITE.

[Repeat]

Nothing but lies.
