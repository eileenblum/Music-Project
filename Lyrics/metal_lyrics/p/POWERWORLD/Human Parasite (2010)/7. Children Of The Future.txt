[Verse 1:]
We rotate in our lost generation.
We never saw the signs above us in the sky.
In a life with public isolation,
we leave the right way in believing all these lies.

[Chorus:]
Die another day,
better think about tomorrow.
The price that we will pay,
for the children of the future.

[Verse 2:]
Break it down like you are working your tuition.
Take the floor, bring changes, donât you hesitate.
In our minds is space for a better education,
we should not only trust in our faith.

[Chorus:]
Die another day,
better think about tomorrow.
The price that we will pay,
for the children of the future.

[Repeat]

[Bridge:]
Children of the future,
of the future.

[Solo]

Die for the future.

[Chorus:]
Die another day,
better think about tomorrow.
The price that we will pay,
for the children of the future.

[Repeat]

Die another day.

Die another day.

Die, die another day.
