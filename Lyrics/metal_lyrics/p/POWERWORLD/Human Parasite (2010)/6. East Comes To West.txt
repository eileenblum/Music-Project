[Verse 1:]
In a world of powerless people,
some things will never change.
We cherish all our illusions,
a dream of an ideal game.

[Pre-chorus:]
In our vision there's no place for anger
and no place for a stupid rage.
Please see the coming danger,
what's demolishing our own age.

[Chorus:]
Remember the day when the wall breaks down,
the world stands still - when East comes to West.
Remember the day when the sorrow is gone,
the world stands still - when East comes to West.

[Verse 2:]
If we mean hope without a fear,
all those words weâve been longing to hear.
With an end starts a new beginning,
a new nation is born and winning.

[Pre-chorus:]
In our vision there's no place for anger
and no place for a stupid rage.
Please see the coming danger,
what's demolishing our own age.

[Chorus:]
Remember the day when the wall breaks down,
the world stands still - when East comes to West.
Remember the day when the sorrow is gone,
the world stands still - when East comes to West.

[Repeat]

[Bridge:]
One nation, one vision.
The end of isolation.

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Remember the day when the wall breaks down,
the world stands still - when East comes to West.
Remember the day when the sorrow was gone,
the world stands still - when East comes to West.

[Repeat]
