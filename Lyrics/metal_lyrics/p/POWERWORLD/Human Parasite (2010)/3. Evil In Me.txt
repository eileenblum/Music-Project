[Verse 1:]
I lived my life like thereâs no tomorrow,
canât deny my deeds.
Never felt any pain or sorrow,
only souls that bleed.

[Pre-chorus:]
End of days, Iâm walking alone my road.
No one prays for my shattered soul,
ohh, what did I do.

[Chorus:]
No way back to loosen the ties,
I am the evil.
No way to recover my crimes,
Iâm bound to the evil in me.

[Verse 2:]
What you see ainât what you get,
I sure do feel regret.
I know it looks like Iâd bide my time,
in truth I suffer and sweat.

[Pre-chorus:]
End of days, I see Iâve lost control.
Final haze, Iâm ready to burn my soul,
ohh, look what I've done.

[Chorus:]
No way back to loosen the ties,
I am the evil.
No way to recover my crimes,
Iâm bound to the evil in me.

[Repeat]

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
No way back to loosen the ties,
I am the evil.
No chance to recover my crimes,
Iâm bound to the evil in me.

[Repeat]

I'm evil.
I'm bound to the evil.
I'm evil, so evil.
