[Verse 1:]
I await the dusk on a silent street.
My mission is clear and Iâm ready to complete.
I'm thunder and lightning, cause I make the change.
I try to place my arms in an apposite range.

[Pre-chorus:]
All I want to do.
All I want to say, to shoot my pain away.

[Chorus:]
To be king for a day, I don't need it.
I don't want to have to make the choice.
To be King for a day my illusion.
To only dream I have the peoples voice.

[Verse 2:]
One guilty man is liable to any other victim.
A single person who is slating his might.
Another man who knows what's good and what's right,
he can deliver with a nation over night.

[Pre-chorus:]
All I want to do.
All I want to say, to shoot my pain away.

[Chorus:]
To be king for a day, I don't need it.
I don't want to have to make the choice.
To be King for a day my illusion.
To only dream I have the peoples voice.

[Bridge]
Stand up and listen, I've got something to say.
We got to do it my way.
Stand up and shout, and open your eyes.
Cos it's no surprise.

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
To be king for a day, I don't need it.
I don't want to have to make the choice.
To be King for a day my illusion.
To only dream I have the peoples voice.

[Repeat]
