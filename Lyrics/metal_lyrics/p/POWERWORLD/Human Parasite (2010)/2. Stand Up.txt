[Verse 1:]
No help, no call.
we rise against the wall.
We fought and lost,
in peace and freedom we trust.

[Pre-chorus:]
Our hearts need to be free,
our souls are bleeding.
Salvation is what we need,
tear down the wall.

[Chorus:]
Stand up.
Stand up itâs time to stop dreaming.
Get up.
Get up for what you believe in.
Stand up.

[Verse 2:]
One night, one dream,
In my mind I keep a silent scream.
Lie awake and sweat,
Iâm afraid to fall asleep.

[Pre-chorus:]
All our dreams need to be free,
our kids are bleeding.
Salvation is what we need,
tear down the wall.

[Chorus:]
Stand up.
Stand up itâs time to stop dreaming.
Get up.
Get up for what you believe in.
Stand up.

[Bridge:]
It's time to stop dreaming, so get up.
Get up, tear down these walls.

[Solo]

Stand up.

[Chorus:]
Stand up.
Stand up itâs time to stop dreaming.
Get up.
Get up for what you believe in.
Stand up.
Stand up for what you believe in.
Stand up.
