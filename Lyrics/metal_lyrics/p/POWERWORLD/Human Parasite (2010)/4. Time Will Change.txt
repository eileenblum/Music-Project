[Verse 1:]
We are in search of many secrets
and sure we don't have the answer.
In a life full of questions we live in deep suspense.

[Pre-chorus:]
Like a child in a lonely desert,
we rise our heads up high, up to the sky.

[Chorus:]
Time - will change our life again,
we have nothing to lose.
Time - will bring my life again,
and back from the road to nowhere.

[Verse 2:]
If one love gets lost in a battle,
there is no reason to give it up.
We have to give our life more chances,
sometimes more than one.
We know itâs no time to go
when things get lost in our life.

[Chorus:]
Time - will change our life again,
we have nothing to lose.
Time - will bring my life again,
from the road to nowhere.

[Chorus:]
Time - will change your life again,
we have nothing to lose.
Time - will bring my life again,
and back from the road to nowhere.

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus:]
Like a child in a lonely desert,
we rise our heads up high, up to the sky.

Time will change your life.

[Chorus:]
Time - will change our life again,
we have nothing to lose.
Time - will bring my life again,
from the road to nowhere.

[Chorus:]
Time - will change your life again,
we have nothing to lose.
Time - will bring my life again,
and back from the road to nowhere.
