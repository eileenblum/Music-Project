[Verse 1:]
Sail across the seven seas of life,
going all the way, but truth is hard to find.
Make believe that wrong is right,
all memories left too far behind.

[Pre-chorus:]
Imperious minds,
twist and turn the wheels of life.
Come and see the pain, donât turn away,
thereâs something on the way.

[Chorus:]
Ashes to dust, stranger in all of us.
Tame your demons down - Tame your demons.
Taking control, affecting your soul.
Tame your demons now - Oh, lord now.

[Verse 2:]
Hidden goals and tangled lies.
Your sins approved behind sweet disguise.
Have you ever thought about the day.
When the curtain falls, your game will fail.

[Pre-chorus:]
Delirious minds,
just spread their crap and blind your eyes.
Go break the rules , donât be a fool,
recall your attitude.

[Chorus:]
Ashes to dust, stranger in all of us.
Tame your demons down - Tame your demons.
Taking control, affecting your soul.
Tame your demons now.

[Solo]

Ah, come on now.

[Pre-chorus:]
Come and see the pain, donât turn away,
thereâs something on the way.

[Chorus:]
Ashes to dust, stranger in all of us.
Tame your demons down.
Taking control, affecting your soul.
Tame your demons now - Oh, lord.

[Chorus:]
Ashes to dust, stranger in all of us.
Tame your demons down -Tame your demons.
Taking control, affecting your soul.
Tame your, tame your demons.
