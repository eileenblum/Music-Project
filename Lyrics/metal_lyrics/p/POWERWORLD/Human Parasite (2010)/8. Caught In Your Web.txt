[Verse 1:]
I run in circles don't look behind,
I hear the echoes in my mind.
Heaven knows I still feel the pain,
voices calling her name in my head.

[Verse 2:]
She knew my weakness, she knew my kind,
she said I'm lonely in the darkest night.
Won't you come to release me from the rain,
she's calling my name.

[Pre-chorus:]
I see the change and I wonder,
all my fears going under and I'm....

[Chorus:]
Caught in your web.
Caught in your web of deep desire.
Caught in your web.
Burning down as the pain grows higher.

[Verse 3:]
Someone told me love is a beautiful thing,
I sit and wonder why the bells don't ring.
I've gone too far, I'm tangled in her wings,
she's calling my name.

[Pre-chorus:]
Divinity in motion,
I get lost in your devotion and I'm....

[Chorus:]
Caught in your web.
Caught in your web of deep desire.
Caught in your web.
Burning down as the pain grows higher.

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus:]
I see the change and I wonder,
all my fears going under and I'm....

[Chorus:]
Caught in your web.
Caught in your web of deep desire.
Caught in your web.
Caught in your web.
Caught in your web.
Caught in your web of deep desire.
Caught in your web.
Caught in your web.

No, caught in your web of deep desire.
Caught in your web.
