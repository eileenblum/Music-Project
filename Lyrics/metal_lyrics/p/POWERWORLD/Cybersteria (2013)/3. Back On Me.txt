I'm back on the streets, I'm back on the line
Try to capture the moment, leave it all behind
Had enough of desperation, of the same old me
I need a new destination, full of energy
I wanna feel the light, take a hold on me
I wanna see the light, enlighten me
Now I'm on the rise, goodbye misery
I will turn the wheel of fortune, bad times are history
I hear voices in the distance, I'm back on my feet
I will turn the wheel of fortune, bad times are history
I wanna see the light, wanna see the sign
I wanna start again, start it all over
Enlighten me

Welcome back, back â I'm back on my feet
I will turn the wheels of fortune, grief is history
Welcome back, back â goodbye misery
No matter how long it takes
I'm back on me

It might be a rocky road
But I can stand the pain
It takes a whole lotta courage
But I can stand the rain
Go two steps back to go one step ahead
Go back
If you wanna win, you gotta play this game
Play this game
You will get burned when you touch the fire
Fire
Be high on the wire to stay alive
I wanna see the light, wanna see the sign
I wanna start again, start it all over
Enlighten me
