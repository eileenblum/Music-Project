Infatuation you're one soul in a million
Your information you trust, believe and reveal Infatuation
Because you're always believing
It's no science fiction
It's not a game, it is real

You think you're safe in the distance
With some fake identity
You're alone in the silence
Man get a grip, it's a fake reality

It's time to reopen the gates
CYBERSTERIA
The time is right, try to get away from the
CYBERSTERIA
There is no way to hide from the
CYBERSTERIA

You're living a dream
In a deadly stream
You're caught in a web
Your life's not what it seems

And now it's time to reopen the gates
CYBERSTERIA
The time is right, try to get away from the
CYBERSTERIA
There is no way to hide from the
CYBERSTERIA
From this place you must get away, get away
CYBERSTERIA
There is no way to hide from the
CYBERSTERIA
CYBERSTERIA
The time is right, try to get away from the
CYBERSTERIA
There is no way to hide
CYBERSTERIA
The time is right, try to get away from the
CYBERSTERIA
There is no way to hide from the
CYBERSTERIA
CYBERSTERIA
