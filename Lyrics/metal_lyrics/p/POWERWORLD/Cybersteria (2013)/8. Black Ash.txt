You wake up at night
You can't wait until tomorrow
You wanna make things right
Because you don't need no sorrow
Black ash all around you
You're standing all alone
You've gotta be tough, gotta be strong
Black ash will surround you
You gotta keep cool
You'll make it, you've been there before
Uh, please realize
This is the price you pay
And all that you'll leave is black ash
Uh, please realize
This is the price you pay
And all that you'll leave is deep black ash

Deep black ash, deep black ash, deep black ash

There's no god in heaven
There's no justice in the world
Your life is slipping away
You hit rock bottom
There's no escape
Black ash is all that remains
Why don't we realize
This is the price you pay
And all that you'll leave is black ash
Why don't we realize
This is the price you pay
And all that you'll leave is deep black ash

Behind the clouds, there is the promised land
Behind the clouds, try to understand

Why don't we realize
This is the price you pay
And all that you'll leave is black ash
And I wanna know, why don't we realize
This is the price you pay
And all that you'll leave is deep black ash
