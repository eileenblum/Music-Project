When the last curtain falls
In the theatre of life
The hope dies at last
We've got the will to survive
I wanna know â it ain't feel right
I can't let go, I'm fed up with fighting

Shadow in the mirror
Can someone tell me why, only one reason why
I feel like a shadow in the mirror
Shadow in the mirror
I just can't realize, come on and tell me why
I feel like a shadow in the mirror
Like a shadow
Shadow in the mirror

While I sit down lonely
With a pile of shards in my hands
A life full of memories
Runs through my fingers like sand
Everything feels so wrong, tell me why
I'm fed up with fighting
