It's a simple game, dreaming your memories
It's not a shame to talk about future
It's not a game to go with your feelings
Here comes the silence
It's a simple game to push friends from side to side
Not a shame to live with your family
Don't think twice, use your chance
Before it's too late

You can't win every battle
You've gotta hold on
Not every battle
You've gotta hold on to your dreams

It's not a shame to educate your children
It's a simple game, torture men to death
It's a simple thing, you can't think twice
Don't make your mother cry

Ignore the voices
Leave nothing undone
You have many choices
It's not a question of time

It's a simple game, dreaming your memories
It's not a shame to talk about future
It's not a game to go with your feelings
Here comes the silence
