I feel like a runaway
Walking the streets of desperation
I live in my own reality
I got my feet on the ground
My soul needs shelter
I can't get no satisfaction
No it feels like love
But it's taking me down
Taking me down

Joystick messiah

Watch out, the cyberboys are coming
We live in a virtual world
Don't know, how to keep it running
I'm just a slave to the powerworld

Need a shot, need a portion
I feel the hunger deep inside
I can watch slow motion
Show me your virtual smile
I need some love
I'm burning, I'm electrified
I am a damn joystick messiah

A night without an end is your desire
You're burning, you set the roof on fire
On fire â Go Higher

Watch out for the cyberboys
Watch out for the cyberboys
Watch out
