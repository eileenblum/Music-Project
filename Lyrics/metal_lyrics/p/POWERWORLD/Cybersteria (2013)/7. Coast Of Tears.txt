End of time, escaping the darkness
Riding high, far away from sadness
All the time, I remember my father saying
There's no guardian angel
Hard to believe, there's no forever
We need to feel, we need to see
We understand things only one way
Sail away

Sail away from the coast of tears
Coast of tears
Flying high like a bird in the sky
Sail away from the coast of tears
Coast of tears, they save your life

Angels of darkness they come without warning
Taking our souls tonight
No time to escape, no chance to hide
We are losing the fight
The land is fluted, our friends are gone
How can we survive
Water captured my soul
Sail away

Sail away from the coast of tears
Coast of tears
Flying high like a bird in the sky
Sail away from the coast of tears
Coast of tears, save your life
