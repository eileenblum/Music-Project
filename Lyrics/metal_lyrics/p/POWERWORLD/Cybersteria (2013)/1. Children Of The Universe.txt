We got a long way to go from here
Wearing the black mask of fear
Our life has turned into one game show
Selling our souls for some stupid career
Small boy is begging on his knees
Asking for food for his family
Some businessman, no sympathy
Is laughing about this boys misery

Is this our life
Is this our way
Is this our kind of living our life

We will run into the fire
We'll go down, this world is going down
We are one, we can save this world
We're the children of the universe

Heaven knows our destination
The destination of the human kind
We can turn the pages over
When will we learn, when will we use our m
The sense of life will stay a mystery
We kill ourselves systematically
We're far away from what we used to be
And no one cares, no one wants to see

Is this our life, Is this our way
We must rearrange â our life
Is this our kind of living our life

We will run into the fire
We'll go down, mother earth goes down
We are one, we can save this world
We're the children of the universe
