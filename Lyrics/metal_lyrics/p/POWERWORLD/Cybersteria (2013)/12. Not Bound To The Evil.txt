Do we cry for the moon
We have wasted a million tears
Are we the shadows of the past
How much more can we take
The years of depression
Leaching out our memories
We obey our tradition
To keep the legacy, insanity

We gotta wake up, because it gets serious
We gotta stop, we're going down
I know that we're not bound to the evil
We gotta stop
Beware the darkness
Beware the darkness
We're not bound to the evil
Not bound to anything

Wars of religion
Millenniums and centuries
Generations of agony
How much more can we take
Of this insanity

We gotta wake up, because it gets serious
We gotta stop, we're going down
I know that we're not bound to the evil
It's getting dangerous
We gotta wake up, because it gets serious
We gotta stop
Beware the darkness,
Beware the darkness
We're not bound to the evil
We're not bound to the evil

Remember there were golden times
When we lived in the temples of gold
In the temples of love

We gotta stop
We gotta wake up, it's getting serious
We gotta stop
We're going down
It's getting dangerous
