Never send your heartbeat around the world
You turn the night into day, without any sleep
You ignore the people around you
You think they stand in your way
You're reaching out for life in your screen all night
You're wasting precious time, for a breath of love

It's not what it looks like, don't lose yourself
the world knows your secrets, virtuality
It's not what it looks like, come back to life
the world knows your secrets, virtuality

The world knows your secrets
You see the glamorous smile of a virtual land
Everything you post is a footprint in virtual sand
You're searching, reach out

The world knows your secrets
Ahaaa, your name is going around
Your name is going around
