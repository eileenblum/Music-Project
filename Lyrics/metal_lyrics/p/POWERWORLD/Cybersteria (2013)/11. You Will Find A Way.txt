Everytime when you feel the fear
You hear the voice screaming, in your head
Scattered thoughts are surrounding you
While you lie in your bed (with open eyes)

With eyes wide open
There is no chance for dreams
Try to trust in yourself

You will find a way
Never surrender, never again
You will find a way
Can you remember, do you?

Real life is in your hands
Go out and shape the human kind
Be the master and not a slave
Of the thoughts running thru your mind
In your bed with open eyes

With eyes wide open
There is no chance for dreams
Try to trust in yourself

So take your chance
And break a lance
To be alright, to be alive
So take your chance
To break a lance
To be alive, to be alive

You will find a way
Send me a little patience
So take your chance
And break a lance
To be alright, to be alive
So take your chance
To break a lance
To be alive, to be alive
