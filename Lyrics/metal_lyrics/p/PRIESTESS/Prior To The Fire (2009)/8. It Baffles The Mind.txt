Three years pass, the tournament's begun.
All the masters of this art have come.
Beast and human from the highest rungs.
Battle hard until we're left with one.

Ohh, it baffles the mind.
Ohh, surpassing us all,
Ohh, it baffles the mind,
I don't find it surpasses me so I'll fight,

Lightning flashes through these final rounds.
Power surges blasts of fire rain down.
Movements so fast, near the speed of sound.
Fight while falling till they hit the ground.
