Last I recall I lost the road
Blind by the night and walking aimless through the cold
Paralyzed with fear, the sound of howling draws near
I wasn't killed but I was mauled
And came to my sense in a hospital
Now I find there's something wrong
I fell down my face grew long
The wolf calls unto me, and I feel it now
Wanting to burst out
I'm being punished by the moon
It pulls me down, I'm a cursed man now
I see a path lit by candlelight
Shadows move through the trees in the night
I'll hide in the forest just off the road
And a violent end, I'll tear your guts out
Blood awash upon the moor, stick to the road
Eyes that never see the light cry no more
Sun in the morning will rise, my conscience cast aside
Back to my wearisome walkabout
Oh, thirty days, I'll have to wait it out
