Wherever you go.
Wherever you come from, our bodies in tow, hearts pound like a kick drum.
We carry a ghost.
We're never alone.
Skin through to our bones, roll hard like the railroad. Stand clear.
One false move, you lose.

We ride tonight, our burning eyes seek the morning light until we die.
We ride tonight, a thousand eyes, all our paths aligned we ride tonight.

Wherever we go.
Wherever we come from.
Rise up from the sand all covered in whale's blood. Latch onto a host.
Now head for the coast.
Drain the carrier's brain now we're in control.
