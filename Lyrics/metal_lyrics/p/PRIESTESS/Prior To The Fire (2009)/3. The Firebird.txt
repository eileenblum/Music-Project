Keep your voices quiet, ears are all around. If we hide each other, no one will be found. I can hear them talking. Lie against the ground. It's almost over. Just don't make a sound. Waiting for the morning. Waiting for the sun to rise. High up in the tower. Chained and bolted down. Looking through the window. Her eyes are on me now. I can't escape it. I can't make a sound. Fly the vulture hunter. Scourge upon the town. On your wings of thunder. Bolting through the clouds. Be drawn together. Lightning strike them down.
