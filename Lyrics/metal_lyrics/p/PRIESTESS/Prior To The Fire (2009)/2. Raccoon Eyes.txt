When I choose my role in the forest of my soul, I would be the mountain, I would erode. I'd block out the sun, get the water in the river to run, and you could climb, a mountain, on which the face that you know, eroded faster. You made it to catch the avalanche that erased it. When I spit my bile in the valley of all time, the forest fells my fire fountain for mile. I'll reshape the earth, the cause of my birth. The future's mine!
