Found the scissors with open blades.
All her garments were burnt.
Recalling pictures of olden days.
All these feelings return.
If you're breathing you better pray, and in the shadows remain.
I'll be stalking you night and day.
Till you've shared all my pain.
Now we step into the fire.
I swear you will pay lady killer.
Bait the killer and lie awake 'till the morning unfolds.
Now he's feeding on my mistakes and the trail has run cold.
All the violence that fills the world.
Leaving nothing for shame.
This is what some are capable of.
Such things I have learned.
Hear my vow and fear my vengeance
