Eleven fold she watched him go, never to see him again.
With countless strides, he'll lead the march, turning mountains to dust.
Why should we waste each others breath on those who choose to run?
If you can't stand to take this heart into your hand, just let it go.
On this moon the flames will rise without her by his side.
Cuts his hand and wipes the blood on the skull of the dead.
There is no line between the weak and those who choose to run.
If you can't stand to take this heart into your hand.
If you can't stand to take this heart into your hand, just let it go.
Pick up the pieces and end what you've started.
