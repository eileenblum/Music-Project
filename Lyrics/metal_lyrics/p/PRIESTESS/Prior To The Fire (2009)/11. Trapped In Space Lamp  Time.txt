I sit alone in a field. It's hard to filter the things I feel. I'm like a skull with no eyes. I'm trapped in space and I'm trapped in time. Every day that you're gone. I drag myself to the street. There's no escaping my own defeat. My bearings all but unknown. I'm in my house but II can't find home. Five long years, I've shut you out, all of these tears falling. Five long years, to end this drought now I can hear you calling. What I can't have I can dream. But theres a tear across every seam. All that was silver is chrome. All that was spirit has turned to stone. Someone led me from the light. I'll regret it all my life. I cut you out of the deal I never thought it would be this real. I'm lost inside this design. I'm trapped in space and I'm trapped in time.
