Back across the ocean. A dark thought that lingers inside you. You left a crack in the doorway. What motivation propels you? If that seal is torn, our fate is certain. Lay waste to all the earth. We disappear. The one who ends all life becomes the hero. Ring down the curtain. No more illusions or lies. Our vile nature for hiding. Has opened up with the skies. The ages are ending. Gone is the passing of time. Watch the angels descending. Gone is the holy divide.
