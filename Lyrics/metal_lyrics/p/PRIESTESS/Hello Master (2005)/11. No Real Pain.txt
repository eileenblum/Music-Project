Waiting on a call to start your day
Waiting for a clever thing to say
I say nothing that I really feel
Work and hope that there's a chance to play
Money's great until it slips away
Well you know that pride's a wheel
And I've been dwelling in the ditch for years
But I can't complain
I can't complain
'Cause there's no real pain
I've known loads of friends who went insane
I've seen many lives go down the drain
I've got buddies who've sold their souls and it hurts
I've even seen death before
But I can't complain
