Lights out in your room
Lights out in your car you gotta hit the ground running
Lights out in the streets where I walked
To carry you home and there's no way ou
I know you fell asleep, pray you don't sleep where you are now you're
all alone
I know you were led by a dark hand
And I'll wait for the morning
I'll trade in all my blood
For everything that you are
What I found is the truth
What I found is enough you gotta keep on running
What I found in the room was my love
All eaten up and you're all alone
I know that you escaped, Cenobites sound the alarm and there's no way out
I know you were led by a dark hand
Lights out in your room
Lights out in the sky you gotta hit the ground running
Lights out in the head that you wore
As a disguise and then you'll die alone
I know they took you back, spitting out chains from the wall you know
there's no way out
I know you were led by a dark hand
