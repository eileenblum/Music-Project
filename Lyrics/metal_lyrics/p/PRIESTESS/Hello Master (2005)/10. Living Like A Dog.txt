When I'm alone I roll in my limited hold
When I'm alone I roll and my limit is gone
Well I've been living like it's high
Do what my heartbeat warns
When my wager is high
Well I've been high before
And you can't stop me on my roll
I was a lonely one, and I'm down on my own
Out in the morning sun and I'm down to the bone
And I've been living like a dog
Do what my heartbeat warns
When my wager is high
Well I've been high before
And you can't stop me on my roll
We did one thing right and we left it alone
We did one thing wrong and it's often at home
And I've been livid, hot and high
I've been a lonely one
Never waited before
But I've been high before
And you can't stop me on my roll
