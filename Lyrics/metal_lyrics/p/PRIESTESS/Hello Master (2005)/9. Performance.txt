Some say happiness is a burden
As I lie here trying to attain
Inside outside I'm nothing
But the more I see through the more I have to gain.
If at first you don't succeed it's normal.
But the second time you're expected to perform.
We perform,
Stand up, listen, I'll tell you where we went wrong.
Give me a reason to stop asking
I know that some things can't be mine
Inside outside I'm nothing
And the layers crumble one piece at a time.
If you expect me to go out there and shine every night
You know there's something about that that just isn't right
We perform
Stand up, listen, I'll tell you where we went wrong
