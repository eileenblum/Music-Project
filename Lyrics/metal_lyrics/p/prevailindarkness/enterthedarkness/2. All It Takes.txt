To war, again
To face both blood and pain
Will name be told? As my bravery unfolds
Through storms of snow and ice, to fight back this demise
Undefeated to the grave, our legacy sealed on this day

[Pre1:]
I promise I'll be fine, this last fight will define
How our proud history, forever speaks of victory

[Chorus:]
With a gun held in my hand I will defend our land
All we love, all that is ours â it is worth to fight and die for

[Spoken:]
Our enemies shall soon behold, the power of the winter's cold

We served and we defended
Our deeds will be remembered
When we are dead and gone, you won't forget all that we've done

[Pre 2:]
Our moral amplified, remember how we died
Let's make the history, tell of our victory

[Chorus:]
With a gun held in my hand I will defend our land
All we love, all that is ours â it is worth to fight and die for

[Spoken:]
Our enemies shall soon behold, the power of the winter's cold
Our vengeance will be furious, cause war is always merciless

[Acoustic:]
With a gun held in my hand I will defend our land
All we love, all that is ours â it is worth to fight and die for
One last stand and soon we're gone, I won't be coming home
Cause our freedom's not for sale, and one day you'll hear our tale

[Stick:]
Our thousand lakes, all it takes
Our legacy, will soon be complete and there will be, no retreat

Thousand lakes, all it takes
So sing, our song! The day, when we are gone

[Pre 3:]
The moral amplified, in the snow we fought and died
Through the ages the history, will speak of victory

[Chorus:]
With a gun held in my hand, sworn to defend our land
All we love, all that is ours, it is worth to fight and die for

[Last Chorus:]
One last stand and soon we're gone, we won't be coming home
Cause our freedom's not for sale and one day you'll hear of our tale
