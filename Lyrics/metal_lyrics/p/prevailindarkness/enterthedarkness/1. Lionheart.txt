Here he comes to claim the throne, the rightful heir, the old king's son
See the warrior arise, victory over demise

[Chorus:]
The lion's blood that runs in me, it's time for you to see
The one who stands the storm alone
The rightful heir to the throne
Hammer high, towards the sky
The world shall hear the battle cry

The time is now, by strength defined, descend the lion's bloodline
It's in my blood, my destiny
No defeat, no retreat
The lionheart shall lead the way
Our new king will arise today

I am here to claim my throne, with all the rights, as the old King's son
Lead the warriors of ice, victorious, immortalized

[Chorus:]
The lion's blood that runs in me, it's time for you to see
The one who stands the storm alone
The rightful heir to the throne
Hammer high, towards the sky
The world shall hear my battle cry

The time is now, by strength defined, descend the lion's bloodline
It's in my blood, my destiny
No defeat, no retreat
My lionheart shall lead the way
A new king will arise today

I have come to prove myself and blaze the trail of my father's name
My charge to keep, by blood I'm bound, to conquer every battleground
Progress made, before excuse, the world is mine to rule

[Chorus:]
The lion's blood that runs in me, it's time for you to see
That I will stand the storm alone
The rightful heir to the throne
The lionheart will lead the way
Your new king will arise today

[Last Chorus:]
The lion's blood that runs in me, it's time for you to see
It's in my blood, my destiny
There's no defeat, no retreat
My lionheart shall lead the way
As new king, see me rise today

I was born, with lion's blood!
I was born, a lionheart!
