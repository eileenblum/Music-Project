Empty and hollow, I've suffered so long
This piece is too tragic, wish I could be strong
But the void inside me grows
With, each, breathe

For everything that must come to an end
For all of you who've been through the same
For the life that we made, then somehow just lost
There is no return.... We're dying

[Chorus:]
There is no point in asking me why
The ghost of your past is here and alive
Still haunting you, until the end of time
Affecting your mind and making you blind

Remember these words, the day when I'm gone
Here's all of my thoughts, I've written them down
Everything that I wanted to say,
But never said, to you

Left of me is an empty shell
A tragic excuse of my former self
I question my own reasons to breath and exist
I'm dying

[Chorus:]
Feeding itself from every lie
The ghost of my past is still alive
Your eyes would bleed before the truth
The dream we shared, were only mine

For the heart that broke and can't be repaired
One final scream for what lies ahead
The ghost is with me all of the time
The dream we shared, were only mine

I want you, to scream my name
Once more, before we both die
This time, I'm your, everything
Come enter the darkness, and see what I see

I am the start and the end
I am your life and your death
I've changed my mind, you'll suffer much more
As the punishment, of life, is yours

Is yours!

[Chorus:]
Feeding itself from every lie
The ghost of my past is still alive
Your eyes would bleed before the truth
The dream we shared, were only mine

For the heart that broke and can't be repaired
One final scream for what lies ahead
The ghost is with me all of the time
The dream we shared, were only mine

I want you, to scream my name
Once more, before we both die
This time, I'm your, everything
Come enter the darkness, and see what I see

I am the start and the end
I am your life and your death
I've changed my mind, you'll suffer much more
As the punishment, of life, is yours!
