[Music: Lars Skjuttorp, lyrics: William Bergbacka]

[Verse 1:]
I shake and tremble, I know this anger will prevail!
I scream out in frustration, because, desperation grants no words!
All that I wished and hoped for, all of it was bound to fail!
My butterfly shall take me high, as I leave this world tonight!

[Chorus:]
This was never meant for me, this was never meant to be!
Once I wanted you to stay, and I remember how you walked away!
Still I denied, refused to see, but the truth just waited to break free!
All you said, all you did, to get your way! You will learn from this pain, was all you'd say!

[Verse 2:]
No sorrow, no mourning, for this broken piece of clay!
Desperate and on my knees, as I beg for you to see things clear!
In your hands, my bleeding heart, I scream out as you walk away!
Cause I fear the knife you hold so tight! Solution: Blood, engaged, tonight!

[Spoken:]
Behold what's coming, the damnation, and the cold winds that will make you fall!
Surrender, to the anger, and the storm that will bury us all!

[Chorus:]
This was never meant for me, this was never meant to be!
Once I wanted you to stay, and I remember how you walked away!
Still I denied, refused to see, but the truth just waited to break free!
All you said, all you did, to get your way! You will learn from this pain, was all you could say!

[Break:]
Drown! In tears! The silence remains!
Die! In your hands! The answer is fading away!

If I rip my heart out for you, will that ever make you understand?
If I should fall, die by your side, will you ever think of me again?

Collected stars to shine for you!
Yet you could never shed a tear!
I see no end, my mind is set!
Here on the shores of no return!

[Chorus:]
This was never meant for me, this was never meant to be!
Once I wanted you to stay, and I remember how you walked away!
Still I denied, refused to see, but the truth just waited to break free!
All you said, all you did, to get your way! You will learn from this pain, was all you could say!

[Last Chorus:]
This was never meant for me, this was never meant to be!
And now as you beg me to stay, I will turn my head and walk away!
This was never meant for me, this was never meant to be!
So go ahead, take your knife and carve this in: "The pain will make you strong with time"
