Abandon me â demand forgivness
Still I might cave in to your sickness
Artificial love â believe in silence
And that you might change a chance for solace

Lie to me â make me believe
I embrace it all as you make me feel
Invincible â I depend on you
But I still know â I should let you go!

[Chorus:]
And now there is a price to pay
And I don't think there is another way!
But I love this nauseating pain
When I crawl through knives, for her again!

You think you are above us all
But do you remember? Do you recall?
How I dragged you up from dust and sand
Your worthless life were in my hands!

[Break:]
Save your heart before it breaks
And blame me for your mistakes
Then finally you've come to see
That you are nothing without me

[Chorus:]
And now there is a price to pay
And I don't think there is another way!
But I love the nauseating pain
When I crawl through knives, for her again!

I know your words could make stay
Cause my heart is never far away!
Oh sweet nauseating pain
I crawl through knives, for her again!

As I open up my eyes
I can only see her lies
All we lost, but never were
Still my heart belongs to her!

Don't go further, stop pretend
I know this night will mark the end!
There is nothing you can do
This is all, because of you!

Don't you shed a tear for me!
It's a relief to be set free!
Oh darling, you're so fine!
But you are no longer mine!

I crave that nauseating pain
I need to be with her again!
Can't you see, there's no repair
Between aggression, and despair!

[Chorus:]
And now there is a price to pay
And I don't think there is another way!
But I need this nauseating pain
When I crawl through knives, for her again!

I know your words could make stay
Cause my heart is never far away!
Oh sweet nauseating pain
I will crawl through knives, for her again!

[Last Chorus:]
Now all is gone, there's no return
And I only wish, to see you burn!
All we had is but a fading lie
In your arms, I bleed and say;
Goodbye!

In your arms, I bleed and say;
Goodbye!
