RECOGNIZE YOUR STEW VIOLENT UNDERTOW
CANÂ´T KEEP THAT BLADE - YOU ARE
YOUR EXTREMITIES CHOPPED WITH AN AXE
COME TO THE FUCKING SLAUGHTER
SHREDDING INTO THE DEATH THE WALL OF DEATH
ONE LAST BREATH - AND NOTHING LEFT
DISTRACT WITH PAIN IN A VIOLENT REIGN
BEING BEYOND THE PALE DECISIONS DROWN
IN A WALLOW FLESH YOU MOURNING OUT
COLLAPSE TO FAINT REDUCED TO A PULP IN A BLOODY WOMB

FOR NO CAUSE YOU FUCKED YOU SHOW NO PAIN
YOU CANÂ´T CRY OUT YOUÂ´RE SOLD
SO TOLD YOURSELF LET ME DIE

YOU REDUCED TO A PULP IN A WOODED BOWL
AND THEY MELT YOUR SOUL MELT YOUR SOUL
FORCED TO OPEN MOUTH
A DENTIST-DRILL INTO YOUR GORGE

YOUR VICTIMIZED SHOCKÂ´N SURPRISED
THEY SHRED YOU ALIVE SAY GOODBYE LAST GOODBYE

I RECOGNIZE NO ONE SURPRISED KILL, KILL THE BRAIN
NO PHILISTINE
NO BREAK FOR GRACE SO BREAK THE AXE
