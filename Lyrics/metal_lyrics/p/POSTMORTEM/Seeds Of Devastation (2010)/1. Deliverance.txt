DREADED DAY HAS COME AT LAST DAY OF DEATH HAS COME TOO FAST
SORROW CRIES ALL HOPE DERAILS GOD IS DEAD ALL LIGHT WILL FAIL
GLORY PASSED A CHILLING FRIGHT A DEVILS RIDE ONTO THE NIGHT
IN SILENCE ALL MY FEARS WIPE AWAY THAT BLOODY TEARS

[Chorus:]
NO HOPE - DELIVERANCE
AND SUSTAIN BEYOND THE VEIL AND CRUELLY ONTO THE NIGHT
A FLESHED GOD AND THEREÂ´S NO HOLD SORROW CRY GOD WILL DIE
NO INNOCENCE WHERE ANGELS MOURN GRIEF AND DIE IN HEAVY STORM
IN AGONY THE FINAL DAWN BLOOD TEARS DEATH MOVES ON

[Chorus:]
NO HOPE - DELIVERANCE
INCEPTION OF YOUR PAIN DROWNING INTO BLACK RAIN FRESH CUT BLOOD DROPS
OUT NO SORROW CRY THERE IS DOUBT FAITHFUL UNTO THE DEATH
BEHOLDS YOUR LAST BREATH CONQUER YOUR WILL TO LIVE SET AND END
AND DEATH WILL GIVE

[Chorus:]
NO HOPE - DELIVERANCE
