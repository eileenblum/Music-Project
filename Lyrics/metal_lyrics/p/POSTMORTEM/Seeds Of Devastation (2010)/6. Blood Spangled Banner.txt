BLOOD SPEAKS HARDLY NOW YOU CAN DIE CLENCHED EACH OTHER OT THE DEATH LETÂ´S BURN WITH THE HOTTEST FLAME BURN
EVERYTHING TO ASH
LAND OF THE FREE BURNED TO ASH UNDER THE SHADOW OF DEATH THEY ROCK, TERRIFY, SPLATTED LOOK

[Chorus:]
BURN BLOOD SPANGLED BANNER
FLAG OF THE BRAVE THEIR BLOOD US GAVE GUARD THE BANNER OF GUILT WARBRINGER OF FREEDOM NO SIGN OF A FUCKINÂ´ HOPE
CATCH THIS WAR AND VENGEANCE GLANCE TO THE BATTLE-SHROUD SHOOTS THE FLAMES STRIKES BELOW TO THE RISE AND FALL

[Chorus:]
BURN BLOOD SPANGLED BANNER
FOREVER TRAPPED YOU CAGED IN FEAR YOU RUN HASTE YOU CANÂ´T ESCAPE

INDOCTRINATION THERE IS NO REVELATION FAST FALLS EVENTIDE OBSOLETE WORDS
JUDGMENT UNCLEAN AND RUDE
