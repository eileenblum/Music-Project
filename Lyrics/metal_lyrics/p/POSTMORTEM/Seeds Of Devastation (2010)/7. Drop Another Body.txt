AS THAT BULLET RIPS
THROUGH THE STILL QUIET AIR
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
AS THE RIFLE RAISED HIGH
TRY TO GET MY CONSCIENCE
TO GET MY CONSCIENCE CLEAR
SLOWLY SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER
AND THE BLOOD RUNS OUT

[Chorus:]
DROP ANOTHER BODY
DROP ANOTHER BODY DOWN
IS THIS, THIS THE BURDEN
WHICH I CHOOSE TO BEAR
WATCHING AND WAITING
FOR FUCKING NEXT PRAY
EMPTY GRAVES AND COFFINS
SURE TO BE FILLED BY ME
IÂ´M ALONE AND FEARLESS
WAITING IN THE PALE MOONLIGHT
KISS MY MAGIC-BULLET
NOTHING REMAINS;
REMAINS FROM YOU
I CAN GET THE BLOOD
AND TO KILL YOU
TRY TO GET MY CONSCIENCE
MY CONSCIENCE CLEAR
SLOWLY SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER
LET THE BLOOD RUNS OUT
