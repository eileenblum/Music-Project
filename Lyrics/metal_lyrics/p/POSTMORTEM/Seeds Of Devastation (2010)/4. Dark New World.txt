SPY ON LIKE WATCHDOGS CANÂ´T YOU FEEL THEIR PROTECTION
CREEPS CLOSER MARTIAL LAWS NEW WORLD TERROR BEING UNLEASHED
LET THE FUTURE FIND US - AND LET US DIE
LEAVE THIS GOD FORSAKEN - THAT CHAOS BEHIND
TRANSFORMED TO SLAVES DUMB AND BLIND READY TO SLAUGHTER
THEIR THUMBS IN OUR SPINES CARROTÂ´N-STICK CALM THE SLAVES
GRACE US WITH LIVES - NOT OURS TO LIVE
AND THE END COMES SLOWLY - BLACK COLORED SKY

[Chorus:]
THIS IS A NEW WORLD - IN A NEW WORLD YOU WILL CRY
THIS IS A NEW WORLD - IN A NEW WORLD YOU WILL DIE
ALL ABUSED Â´N DESECRATED SERVITUDE IN THAT DIRECTION
SECRET STATÂ´S SURVEILLANCE DARK DECEPTION ON THE WAY
AND WE HAVE NOTHING - NOTHING TO PROTECT YOU ARE THE NEXT ONE
NEXT THROUGH THAT DOOR
INDOCTRINATION THERE IS NO REVELATION FAST FALLS EVENTIDE OBSOLETE WORDS
JUDGMENT UNCLEAN AND RUDE
