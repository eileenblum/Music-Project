YOU FEEL LIKE NAKED MORE DESOLATE THEY ACT LIKE DEMONS WILL EAT YOUR FLESH
UPON THE SMOKE OF THE BURNING FREE THEY FEED THE RICH AND EAT THE POOR
EVERYTHING ON FOCUS EVERY STEP YOU MAKE YOU CANÂ´T ESCAPE THEY DESECRATE
THEY GIVE US NUMBERS LIKE SLAVISH PIGS THEY SET THE WORLD ON FIRE AND WE
SHOULD PAY THE PRICE

[Chorus:]
THESE SHALL BE A WAR - A WAR AGAINST THE LAMB - HATE GIVE US HATE

CAN YOU FEEL THE STENCH STENCH OF CORRUPTION THEY GIVE THEIR KINGDOM
UNTO THAT BEASTS THERE IS NO SALVATION NO LIGHT OF GOD THESE SHALL BE A WAR
AGAINST THE LAMB

[Chorus:]
THESE SHALL BE A WAR - A WAR AGAINST THE LAMB - HATE GIVE US HATE
