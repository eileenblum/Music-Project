AND YOU WILL WALK OVER CRUSHED BONES AND BODIES AND YOU WILL
SMELL ROTTEN FLESH OF THE SLAIN DEAD AND FROM THE BLADE THE
BLOOD DROPS DOWN SLOWLY THE SWORD STOOD RED AND YELLING FOR
MORE BLOOD AND YOU WILL SEE INTO THE FACE OF THE UNDEAD
DEMONS OF WAR BRING US ALL UNTO DARKNESS BEYOND THE VEIL LAYS
THE CHANCE TO ESCAPE Â´EM OR YOU MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITH THE
WAR GHOSTS

[Chorus:]
FIGHT BACK - GHOST TO THE WARSHIP - A FUTURE DENIAL
AND THY WILL FEAR DESPERATE ON THE EDGE LINE IS THIS IS THE SHAPE
BLACK SHAPE OF THE WARSHIP IS THIS THE PATH; THE PATH AND THE
HELLROUTE THE WAY IS PAVED; PAVED WITH YOUR OWN BLOOD
