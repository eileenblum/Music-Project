I am the darkness the wicked core no one can stop me I'm everywhere
I despite all your pleading all your words of the wise all that's vain cause I'm the evil

Tick'n, tick'n the end no, no my friend
I epitomize all the horror in the world
I am the fear; the fear inside your head

I am the touch of evil, the sudden death I'm like the howling in a wolfshriek
I'm the one who smelled of horror I'm the one who smelled of death
That's the thing you should remember

Tick'n, tick'n the end no, no my friend
I epitomize all the horror in the world
I am the fear; the fear inside your head

I am the hatred I am the fear dear little victim determined to hide
I have nailed the one called Jesus I have dropped thebombs of war
That's the thing you should remember

Tick'n, tick'n the end no, no my friend
I epitomize all the horror in the world
I am the fear; the fear inside your head
