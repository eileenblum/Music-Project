Darkness dance with me all that time
Out twisted laughter mocking life shrine
All too late now cause I beg for more
For more suffer down in dirt

It's a gutterball welcome down

My existence is filled with hate
Glowing embers against the dark
Well emotion brilliant to behold
Pulsating passions yearning unfold 

It's a gutterball welcome down

Your life is fragile your embrace is cold
It doesn't matter just a spray
Slow motion dying deeds
We dancin gutterballs

It's a gutterball welcome down

In pure darkness be careful on your way
Almost stress come here
Drop by drop, sting by sting
It doesn't worn by the thing

It's a gutterball welcome down
