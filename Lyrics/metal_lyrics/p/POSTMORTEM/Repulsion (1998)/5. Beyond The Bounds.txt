What have you to ignored
Or crushed beside away
What have you turned from hell
Cause the past harried you
Fear beyond the bound
Fear beyond the bound
Fear beyond the bound
And what you suffer

Life a load of fear

Who who don't care about faith
Who may be a little hard
And hopes wish to take wing
Just open the door to hell
Fear beyond the bound
Fear beyond the bound
Fear beyond the bound
And what you suffer

Don't you know the danger beyond
This bound never fear for cause I'm
Here oh my dear never before I felt
Such fear

For when it's over now
When all said and done
You lookin back at you
Who who has won?
Fear beyond the bound
Fear beyond the bound
Fear beyond the bound
And what you suffer
