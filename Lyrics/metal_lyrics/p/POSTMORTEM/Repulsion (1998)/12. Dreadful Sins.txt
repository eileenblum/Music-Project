Along the shore, the cloud waves break
The sun sink behind the haunted lake
The shadows laughten in Carcosa strange
Come, come to the city of dreadful nights

Dreadful sins, dreadful sins
Evil memories spids me like a web
Take me farther back

The old stone-gods will arise forgot
A rub of dust, of thousand years
The gods crush your cathedrals away
They will kill with kindness possed

Dreadful sins, dreadful sins
Evil memories spids me like a web
Take me farther back

The black moon circle through the skies
Strange is the night where black stars rise
Songs of hyades shall sing and praise the one
But strange still is the place-deaddance

Dreadful sins, dreadful sins
Evil memories spids me like a web
Take me farther back
