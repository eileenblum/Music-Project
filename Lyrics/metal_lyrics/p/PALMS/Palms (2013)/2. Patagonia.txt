There's a hole in space
Where the demons wait
They control our sounds
When the silence goes
By the time we awake
The desires go on

There's a queen in place
Would decide our course
While the silence waits
Till the silence comes

We dance across the realm
We dance across space

Does a tree like rain?
Smell the lonely waves
To control our signs
When the silence comes

A hero inside
All over this web
Lying inside
All of his wreath
A hero inside
Over his wreath
Waiting inside
Covered in smiles
Loving your steps

Across the realms
Dance above the plains

There's a hole in space
Where your demons wait
To control our sounds
When the silence goes
When the silence goes
We will see ourselves
When the silence goes
When the silence goes

A hero inside, over this wed
Lying inside, over his wreath
