I slipped into your sight,
but didn't feel anything deep inside.
Then looked out,
through clean eyes,
but didn't see anything that I liked.

The closer I am,
I notice something's wrong with you.
The closer I am,
I know there's something wrong.

You have destroyed it,
destroyed it.

I climbed into your mind.
I didn't find anything there worthwhile.
I switched back to realize,
I notice something is still not right.

The closer I am,
I notice something's wrong with you.
The closer I am,
I know there's something wrong.
I know there's something wrong with you

You have destroyed it,
destroyed it.

We let go tonight.
Let us through tonight.

Let us through.
Let us through.
So we can both remember.
So we can both remember.
