I looked through your frame
and watched death go by.
I move towards her gaze
to catch it by surprise.

It's something new to try
somewhere in the tides.
When we catch our stride,
then you can decide.

Throw me your halo
down the halls of doom.
I'll lead the way
through the combs of time.
Show me your heaven
down the halls of doom.
I'll lead the way
down the combs of time.

Find our way. [Repeated]

Now you know the way
Now you know the way
Now you know you're tied. I expect you to decide.
Now you know you're tied. You can never turn away.
Now you know you're tied. You can never turn around. You can never turn away.
Now you know you're tied. I expect you to decide that you'll never turn away.

It's like heaven in true time, like heaven.

Now you know you're tied.
You will never turn away.
It's your
it's your
time.

Scanning the horizon,
trying to find our bed.
Gliding on the ice,
covered to our heads.
Stranded under ice,
trying to hold our breath.
Scanning the horizon,
covered to our heads.

I watch the dead go by.
I watch the dead get far.
I watch the dead go by.
I watch the dead get far, get far.

Racing against the throes of time.
Try to pretend you know your prize.
Covered in smiles, the lights shine thick ahead.
Hovering in the throes of time.
Hard to resist,
we know it's our time.
Rest your eyes.
Just rest your eyes.
