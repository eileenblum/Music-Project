I kiss you goodbye
then release in the sky
I stare in your core
as you rise from the shore
It goes by.

Over the sand, into the light,
over the sea, the waves go by.
Under the sun, back to the land,
into the night, between your hands.

Relax in the tides.
Feel your breeze going by
over our head
You display with your dance.
It goes by.

Over the sand, into the light,
over the sea, the waves go by.
Under the sun, back to the land,
into the night, between your hands.

You try to contain it.
It shoots out between your hands.

I kiss you goodnight.
Lift your face to the light.
The taste of your cell
lays the key to your spell.
It goes by.

Over the sand, into the light,
over the sea, the waves go by.
Under the sun, back to the land,
into the night, between your hands.

You try to contain it,
but you're in over your head.

I follow in the wake of your tide.
Good enough to come around.
Try to keep the pace of your stride.
Trying to keep the axis straight.
Laying in the wake of your trail.
Good enough to come around.
Caught up in the waves of your spell.
Trying to keep the axis straight.
Laying in the wake of your trail.
Good enough to come around.
Caught up in the waves of your spell.
Trying to keep the axis high.
