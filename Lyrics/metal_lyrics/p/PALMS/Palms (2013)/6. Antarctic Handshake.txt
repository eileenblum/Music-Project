Inside.
Inside of the whale I come to you
and now it's your turn,
your turn to evaluate
all those times you let go.
Outside, I've let you in
through the years, it's time to let go.
The two of us at the end.
Off the grid. Arms first.
Arms first.
Now you know, it's time to let go.
Let go. It's time to let go.
