I don't know what to say,
but I will never leave your side.
How can you think
I could ever say goodbye?

These walls are warm and safe.
You keep my head above the tides,
holy and so right.
Your arms are warm and safe.
They hold my head above the tides,
holy and so right.

I don't know what to say,
I will never say goodbye, for anything.
No I would never say goodbye.

Your arms are warm and safe.
You keep my head up in the sun.
It's always so right.

So forget about the days.
We're almost all the way
Forget about the times we were lonely.
Now hold me, and you hold me.

Ascending into heaven,
while staring into hell.
You're staring into heaven,
descending into hell.
