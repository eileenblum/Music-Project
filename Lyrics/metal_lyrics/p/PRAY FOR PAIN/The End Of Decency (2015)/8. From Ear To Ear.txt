This is my destiny, my last will
When Iâll leave this fucking earth
No denial, no regret, curse my birth
Just make this life something worth

When itâs time, for you to die
Youâll say goodbye with a smile

Blood is everywhere guts flying through the air
In my eyes you stare, my shotgun doesnât care
You will feel my knife inside your wasting flesh
See you dead is all and everything I wish
Organs stopped to work, you suffocate dismal
Bowls of blood will squirt, thatâs what Iâm living for
Soon my work is done, you fucked up piece of scum
Cutting out your tongue and finally I cum

I must confess, deep in my heart
That when men die, my dick gets hard
Fuck you all, I donât give a shit
On all your graves, I will spit
