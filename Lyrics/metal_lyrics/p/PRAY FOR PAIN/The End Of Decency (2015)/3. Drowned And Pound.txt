Itâs always been my desire, to be cleansed
All the filth to transpire, in one breath
I wanted to fuck her, cool and fresh
Candle light romantic tunes, in the bath

How could Iâve known of my fetish           
A passion that I canât confess 

I stroke her genital, massaged the neck, then erected
A sudden urge to end her life, vile infect

Grapped her hair, pulled down the head 
The limbs go stiff, after they splashed 

How I love the graving, when pressure stops the heart
Blood spurts out of ears and nose then, the eyes go blind now the fun will start 
Grief, loath, remorse, self disgust
Hate, pain, despair, but it canât be stopped

Inverting the brain, driving me insane, murder as a gam
ruthlessness is guiding me, stalking through the night
bloodlust as my guide, visions of delight, everyoneâs a target

So many caught but itâs never enough, tied stones to the chest
Thrown in the pool, my underwater love nest

So soft and wet, when they disperse 
Redefinition of perverse
