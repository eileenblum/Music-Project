In my childhood I have been abused
Always excluded, sexually confused
So to bother kids became my fate
Dominate, castigate and mislead
Violate, all the lust I canât take

First it was enough to haze
Then disgust turned to hate
Ambuscade, at schools I wait
Blood, sweat, tears, ejaculate

She lies to my feet, alive I guess
A knife in my hand, my cock in her ass

You think itâs over, but Iâm not done
Donât expect mercy, until I cum

Iâll teach her a lesson for life, today with my knife
Into the darkness fade her cries, I cum as the light leaves her eyes

Life will never be like it was before
There are things out there you canât ignore
You will never forget, I know itâs tough
Broken mind, virginity trashed
Flesh is slashed, adversity makes me laugh
