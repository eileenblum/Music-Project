When my father died he told me son
Never mess around with a breed called women
A filthy excuse of human

Crown the cock, enslave the cunt

What we see in them no man commits, an ass, a cunt, a pair of tits
Beat them up and pierce their clits

No pleasure, just suffer

Useless flesh around a cunt named women

Beat your wife even if you donât know why
She will know it for sure, I tell you try
When you go to your wife donât forget the whip destroy
Her flesh and her fucking will

Fucking is all you are worth for
Just get in the kitchen and clean the floor
Unequal rights is what I stand for

Crown the cock, enslave the cunt

On their knees they all should pray
For hypocrisy they all should pay
Women deserve to be treated that way

No impact, no respect

I know youâre innocent, but i wanna cum
At your execution you shit fucking cunt
Women should serve our dissipation
And if they donât they deserve castigation
This is a fucking menâs world
