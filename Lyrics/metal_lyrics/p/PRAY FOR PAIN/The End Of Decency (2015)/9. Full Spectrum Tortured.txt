Indifference, spread like disease
Stripped of all sense, and morality
All meaning of life, had been destroyed
Replaced by sloth, emotional void

Full spectrum tortured, crippled and blind
Vestige remains, unidentified
This wretched existence, has come to an end
Embrace salvation from my hand

Bound and gagged, stripped and slugged
Eruption inside the head

Sorted tools onto the desk
Drill, saw, knife, nails, pliers, shred

Suffer till your final breath
I give you a slow and pain full death

Break all bones
Eyes, ears, nose mutilated
Arms, legs, tongue, genitals amputated
Eaten to complete the master piece
Rest in vomit, shit and piss

Full spectrum tortured, epiphany
Cleansing through pain and misery
A memorial raised of feces and gore
Wasnât this worth living and dying for
