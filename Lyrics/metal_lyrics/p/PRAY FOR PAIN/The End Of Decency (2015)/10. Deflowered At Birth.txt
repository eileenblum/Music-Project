âNot a single virtue outpaces so many vices. I donât worship any,
I hate them all and itâs not only about doing evil but never do any good.â

Sowing seeds in anguish, in filth rotten flesh and scat
Flourished into a fetus, by the garbage of life itâs been fed
With all might it tried to strangle, itself with the umbilical cord
But destiny wonât be avoided, deprived of its last resort

Pain strives through the womb, promising another rape
Broken, throbbing, embrace misery, as the legs agape

Mouth opens, the uterus vomits
A gush of blood, spat into darkness

Come take a look at the defiled fetus
In disgust you puke and turn your eyes away
Left alone to die, screams resound in darkness
Drawing all the beasts, what an easy prey

Finally you will face the fact, how good your abject live is
Hatred, wealth and poverty, all will be appreciated

Innocence, if there is a god
Lost, he must be a sadist
If there is salvation it will only be in death
What we cannot hate, cannot be loved

Gash rips open, vile penetration
Unheard, screams for salvation
Frantic genital amputation
Cursed to exist, suffocation

The spirit is willing, the flesh so weak
So easy to beat, so tender and sweet

Through pain and blood conceived to earth
Deflowered at birth
