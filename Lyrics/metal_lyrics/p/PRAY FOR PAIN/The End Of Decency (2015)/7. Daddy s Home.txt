Abomination unleashed, you deserve a live thatâs pleased
Every notion to empower, Iâll devour
Every climbs of hope torn to pieces
Violence as a tool to secure total dependency
My will be done, forever slave
Make Albert Fish smile in his grave

Trapped in their minds, the will is broken
Crimes that shall remain unspoken
Branded for life, as my design
You will be forever mine

Perseverance shall abandon me, brutality breaks free

The only purpose of a man is to leave his traces
I will spit your pathetic morals back into your faces
 No reason can be found, make a choice, itâs live or die
Thereâs nothing to regret, nature is cruel and so am I

I need no excuses, Iâm all yours to blame, beat you into the hole from which you once came

The door is broken, shattered glass everywhere, the smell of whiskey is in the air
The stench of sweat and tears, is drawing flies
My knuckles are swollen, blood drips from my hands, like semen from my cock
The scent of misery and fear is what you owe me, you wretched spawn
Daddyâs home

Not passion leads me to the crime, but my nature
My way is clear and Iâll never regret, my pleasure
I will not give up my inclinations and Iâll never hesitate with my decisions

The existence of a god is an outrageous absurdity
Only the social boundaries are against me

Ancient urges of my fathers, will accept this inheritance
Follow in my footsteps when Iâm gone 
Like father, like son
