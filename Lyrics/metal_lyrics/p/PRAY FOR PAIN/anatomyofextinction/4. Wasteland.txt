"In a world filled with so much pain, apathy becomes the only salvation!"

Not a single sound of life illuminates this earth
This place of infertility that now lost all its worth
Roots and seeds have all died off, their leaves have turned to ash
Seas and rivers dried out between rotten piles of trash

No rays of light upon this world, no sun, no tides, no growth
Eternal darkness, endless night, as below so above
The shattered remains will bear witness, for all comes at a cost
Only the silent winds will whisper of the life that's lost

Nothing will be left to fertilize this earth
There's no going back, trapped

I watch humanity drown in chaos,
Misery and suffering
I watch the world burn to the ground
And I feel nothing

Life is suffering. Get fucked!

All this filth, this bile, so sickening. Flood the mind 'til you can't breath.
Force fed misery, responsibility, inherited history, born guilty

Total domination is the constant exploitation for diminishing the mind

Leaving nothing but a wasteland behind.

How in the midst of all this sorrow, could any kind of hope endure
Volition as the last a resort, resistance is the only cure

Within this barren soil of death, a single seed may thrive.
When nurtured by the strength of will and genuine of sacrifice
