Suppression is the premise for the menace to control the mind.
Compunction will not cease this.

Perish all that's cherished, to diminish and then left to die
Abstraction infection

The sickness raids the organism, searching for the precondition
Perforating with precision, procreated demolition

Infested and slowly grown, from mind to blood, from flesh to bone.

Contaminate the organs, disaggregate and wither, with the suffering.

Pressure and ulceration, consume every breath.
Violent deformation, a slow and painful death.

The only way out, is all the way through.
A garden flesh, a maze of tissue.

Cut through pain and violence
Cut through the fear and the silence
Cut from skin to the gut
Cut open your self up

Decomposition with startling precision.

Let the pressure tear the skin, revealing what is held within. Anatomy begins.

Mind, blood, flesh, gut

Slowly digging through the muscle, separating bones from gristle.
Let it splinter, gush and crack. There's no going back.

Lay bare what was concealed, the provenance revealed.

The only way out, is all the way through
The maze of existence, the burden of virtue

Cut the weight of the past
Cut the burden at last
Cut display your innards
Cut inside and outwards

The healing will strain, but it won't be in vain.
Through struggle and pain, only the scars will remain.
