A colossus of flesh and stone
Blood, air and soil, water and bone
Slowly ascends from the undertow
The nothingness, it will bestow

Descend into existence

Impregnated with the seeds of perdition
Sacrificing it self for nutrition
By her own blood she will suffer
The origin, the primordial mother

Giving birth in anguish, the contractions came too soon.
Violent disembowelment, which the infants will consume.

Thrive, jet there is nothing but disdain in their eyes

It's never enough, greed, gluttony and sloth

They drink her milk 'til it's gone, until she's all skin and bone.
Take everything for their own, give nothing back in return.

Pillage the treasures, excise the freedom that they despise
Betraying the sacrifice, rape everything that's life

More, more, insatiable

They've taken it all without any regret, no absolution and no going back
Retaliation for if you cut of the head, their blood runs black

Blood runs black
We're as good as dead
