Seal the fate on your demise, forlorn human species.
Life decays and death shall rise, pain is the salvation.

Spell these words of malice in the blood of those who perish,
For the only truth they cherish is the blissfulness of faith.

Seal the fate on your demise, human generation.

Behold this, for there will be no mercy.
Receive this sacrifice, and let the madness begin.

Everything they've built, destroyed. Torn apart from the inside.
All will fall upon this lie. For each and all of them must die

Show the world evil that it never knew existed.
All sense of mercy will be mutilated.

Chaos ensues, smoke and fire choke up the air
Deafening screams mingle with the gun fire
Endless ammunition, shredding flesh, splinter every bone
Slaughter and disfigure, trembling as they pull the trigger

How many lives does it take to be free
How much pain to face reality
How much more misery
To life in peace, finally.

Everything they've built, destroyed. Trapped by guilt inside this void.
Gratitude turned into greed, the decimation of the weak.

A generation segregated, trapped in fiction
All traces will be left exterminated

Descend into the mouth of the irrational abyss.
Suffocate the opposition, for ignorance is bliss until

The illusion bleeds to death
And then hope will collapse

You're not going to heaven.
No one hears your prayers.
Martyr
We're not going to heaven.
No one hears our prayers.
