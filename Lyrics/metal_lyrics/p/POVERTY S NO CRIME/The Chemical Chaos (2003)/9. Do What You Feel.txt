Nature is poison
Time has no end
The forthcoming danger
Just a part of this game

Can I be wrong with a single decision ?
Can I be wrong when I'm fighting to win ?
Can I be wrong of going this way ?
nothing will change if you do what you feel !

Life is like an engine
Hormons can kill
Chances of a lifetime
Expose the way that we go 

Does it make sense to be ambitious ? 
Should I be proud if I carry the day?
Can I be wrong of going this way ?
Nothing will change if you do what you feel !
