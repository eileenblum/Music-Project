I know the world could be a better place
I know the truth is hiding beneath a moonlit sky
But the lights are shining bright right trough the darkness of the night
Who knows the answers to all that we are longing for ?

I know know the days they stand aside the night
I know the worlds revolving at one thousand miles an hour
Some many things I`ve seen - so many tiles I can`t assign
You always wanted to know before you have to go

All minds in one they can see what is left to find and
Carry the weight of this world for a timeless moment

I know the world could be brighter place 
I know the world moves on an endless track
Some many things I`ve seen - I`m just an ordinary man 
I hope to realize by using erveryone

All minds in one they can see what is left to find and
Carry the waste of this world for a single moment
All things must change - full steam ahead

Let the light shine into the dark of our minds
Let the light shine in to warm up the nights
Let the minds connect to one magic eye
Let the minds control the chaos inside
Oh, it`s bright I can see it alll
Clear in my dreams
Let the light shine into the mysteries of life
Let the light flow into
Nobody knows what we will find

All minds in one they can see what is left to find and
Carry the weight of this world for a timeless moment
All things must change - full steam ahead
