Do you believe in something 
Like the mighty hands of fate
Every life is a mortal thing
And noone knows this plan

Cosmic forces stream as a part of light
Chasing every kind of life 

How can I take my chances?
It's not a question of time
Better you save your files in time
No matter what they say

Some get hunted, some live a single day
Some are just like birds of prey

The more I feel plain
the more life's invain
I'm caught in this place
I'm lost in the space of an endless maze
The small human race
the god that we choose - unfortunaltely gone

Cosmic forces sow an encoded seed
There in every kind of life

The more I feel plain
the more life`s invain
I'm caught in this place
I'm lost in the space of an endless maze
The goal of this chase
we thought that we know - unfortunaltely gone
I'm caught in this place
I'm lost in the space
I thought we know it`s all invain....
