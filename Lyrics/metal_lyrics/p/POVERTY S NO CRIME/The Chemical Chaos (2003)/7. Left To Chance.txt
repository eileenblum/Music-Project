you say you won`t
won`t be a victim of natures unrest
Fuse it into a will
I know I will always be caught in this maze

Don`t count the days
Every moment is like a hole in your time
But life is moving on 
I know will always be caught in my fate

We can`t make it whole again
nothing is left to chance I know
