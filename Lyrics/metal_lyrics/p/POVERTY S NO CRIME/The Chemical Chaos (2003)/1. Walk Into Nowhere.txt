Some say they can light my way
Along the distance of the desert grey
Some say they can ease your pain
Some believe in they are safe and sound

Sunlight keeps me holding on
In compensation for the midnight days
No place I would rather be
Only one thing that is left to say

My hands are tied cause of the mortal life
Don`t close my eyes to see the other ones die
We tremble softly when the fortune smiles
We spin so many wheels to come alive
I fear the momentary walk into nowhere

Moments unreal through lenses of fear
Faces look scary when we turn off the lights
What makes us cling to a small grain of sand ?
Why do we long for a life without end ?

Moments - wasted away
All disappear in the dust of this place
What makes us cling to a small grain of sand ?
I never wanted to feel it this way

See them crawling from here to there
On the surface of the world they share
Defending secrcets they can`t explain
All is still insecure !

My hands are tied cause of the mortal life
Don`t close my eyes to see the other ones die
We tremble softly when the fortune smiles
We spin so many wheels to come alive
I see them hopelessly fall into nowhere
