Lay down your arms and resign
the way back is filled with time
hollows out the years under the ground 
what makes me feel so alone ?

something`s guiding me 
through the valleys of time
something`s blinding me 
I lose the balance inside

the world is too complex to define
If all things must change why do we cry ?
we are what we are just for while

oh, something`s leading me
what goes up must come down

moments get lost in the haze of tomorrow
we all walk the same way to carry the weight of the past

moments get lost in the haze of tomorrow
we don`t have the power to bury the pact with the the past
