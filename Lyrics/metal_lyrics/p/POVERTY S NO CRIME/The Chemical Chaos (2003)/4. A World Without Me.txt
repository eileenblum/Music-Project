Something`s scaring my mind
such a desperate thing
because I always pretend 
to be what I am

I`m following signs 
on the the steps of my life
something`s out of control
what remains when I'm gone

I fear the things I`ve left undone
As much as the things I`ve said and done
To be a part of everyone
Is like to sign your name at the sky
How would this world be without me?

every place where I stay 
every word that I say
I`ve been leaving a trace
for all the moments in time

no need to regret
the lost can be found
I will cover my ways
you won`t see me again

I fear the things I`ve left undone
As much as the things I`ve said and done
To be a part of everyone
Is like to live untill the end of time 
How would this world be without me?
