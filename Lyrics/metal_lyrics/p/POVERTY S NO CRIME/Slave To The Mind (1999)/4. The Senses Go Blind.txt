Take the world - just pay the price
For all the things that we need to be someone
Strange we call it a paradise 
We obey like soldiers in user-military
I believe in what I feel
It tastes like sugar but it`s poison
That is dazing our minds

So you think you are alone
And you need something that pretends
You are someone
Your gold is only painted glass
Your fortune is just another illusion
The secret is to have no choice
It`s no wonder that your senses go blind

The feelings unite - the senses go blind , so blind
Someday you`ll find it`s just waste
What they offered with a shine 

Used but so amused , like a toy in their hands
You believe in what they say , "why should they lie?"
With naked fears if the feeling disappears 
"I just want to satisfy my needs"
With hungry eyes and lack of restraint
Hopeless to refuse it`s much too late

The feelings unite - the senses go blind , so blind
Someday you`ll find it`s just plastic
But they made it shine

Used and so abused and as guilty as a child
No one should control the way we feel
You are buried in gold that`s gonna melt in your hands
"I don`t want my senses go blind , no they won`t ..."
