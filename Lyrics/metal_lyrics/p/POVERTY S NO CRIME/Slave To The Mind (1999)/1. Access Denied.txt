I feel confused by the people around
When I see how they selfishly open their mouth
You are the one who can talk them all down
I might be to shy but I`ve still got the right

We pay attention to the man in the light
I`d rather take my way out of the crowd

Silence is my only friend
but noone seems to understand
How can I talk with a scared pair of eyes
I'm close to explain but I'm still paralyzed

I long for the day when the speechless unite
Mine is the silence so leave me alone

See what I dream - feel what I fear
Watch the shadow `coming over me again
See what I dream tonight I fear when I feel alive
Watch the shadow - it`s coming over me again

The door is closed inside of me 
someone threw away the key
My fear is is deep and cold as ice
Noone really needs to know

Words in my head - somewhere like gold in the night
Access denied - you know you make me say nothing
and refuse for ever more...

See what I dream - feel what I fear
Watch the shadow `coming over me again
See what I dream tonight I fear when I feel alive
Watch the shadow - it`s coming over me again
The voice inside of me is an ancient memory
It keeps all the laughter `till the day i`ll let it out...
