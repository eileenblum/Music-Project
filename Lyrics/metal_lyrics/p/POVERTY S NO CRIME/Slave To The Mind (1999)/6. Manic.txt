Master of mind keep me away from the line 
Master of mind keep me away from the crime
I follow your signs when I fear that I have to decide

He takes my hand `teaching me how to pretend
Always a friend trust in his words till the end
Lead me to heaven I`ll do what you want me to do

Fear in my head - dust in my eys
I feel your intention in times of the night
It`s the strenght that can force to obey
Before I rely on the power you have 
I`ll be gone

Play with my soul - always inside
Defy my religion - a slave to the mind
It`s the fear of the use of your might
But how can offer resistance to you in my head ?
