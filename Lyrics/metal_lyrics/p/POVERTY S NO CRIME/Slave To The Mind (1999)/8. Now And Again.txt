Would you like to be the one 
would you like to be renowend ?
A silent rage can pave the way 
can keep the coldness in your eyes
Weak and chased into the light 
and just a heartless smile away
They all believe in what I seem to be 
so I must keep this face alive

This is a world of anger and hate
We dream of heaven but we live in hell

Now and again - now the feeling is over again - with a lie
You can always pretend it`s alright and fine
Could you help me to fight when danger is high ?
When my honesty fades away
Who`s afraid to be alive again ?
What in me- what is deep in my mind ?
What if the danger makes me feel I could die ?

Still in my head what makes be this way
And what can ease the blame inside
Too much hate too many oppositions
But the order was to win somehow
I believe there is a place to be 
people get along without a trace of baseness

This is a world of anger and hate
We put our faith in hells?array
We dream of heaven but we live in hell

Now the feeling is over again - though I try
Could you help me to find my way out of the ice
That has frozen the dream of a warm summernight
Can I offer myself to you ?
I believe that I can learn to feel 
What is in me - what`s behind my eyes ?
Is it a dream withhin a lost paradise ?

If I could feel - if I could feel ashamed
I lose my faith within a thousand lies
All my life could be the final lie..
