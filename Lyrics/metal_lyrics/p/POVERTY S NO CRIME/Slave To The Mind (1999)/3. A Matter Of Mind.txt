Another lonely night in your head 
This is only a matter of mind
And when you play this game your whole life
How can you say if it is wrong or right ?

You can wait for a change of your mind 
this is only a matter of time
And when you close your eyes overnight
He will awake in the bright moonlight

I don`t know how these feelings change
It must be more than only Jekyll and Hyde

Take the pain lose again 
He is a friend you know
a spotlight there on my own Error again
Different minds in ordinary minds 
fill them up with all that we are willing to want and like
no one is searching but I want to know
To end up my day

Is that how you get into my eyes 
When people lose their way
It`s the opposition of me
But he is strange to everyone
It doesn`t lead me astray

Different minds in ordinary minds
Fill them up with all that you are wiilling to want and like 
No one is searching but I want to know
to end up my day

Oceans flow in my veines
Demons - do we need to fear ?

Sometimes a distant spying sattelite
The put on mascerade is alright
So if you call him the master of your mind
He will show you his world in moonlight
When people lose their way...
It doesn`t lead me astray

Different minds in ordinary minds
Justifys the cause to fail
Different eyes see all that even minds
A spotlight there on all who are not willing to try
