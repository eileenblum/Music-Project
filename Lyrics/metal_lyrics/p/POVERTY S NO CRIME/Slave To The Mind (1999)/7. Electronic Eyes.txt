What is the answer to my hopes and dreams ?
The speed of the progress changes day by day
We`re looking around to find that certain line
But never seem to understand

Thousands of miles on just a single day 
We`re starting ahead to walk the milky way tonight
There`s nothing to win and nothing to find new
Only the mind is still left to know

You will understand when you realize
We help to make an enemy
Can`t you see the line into I should fall
And disappear ?
With electronic eyes
Could we ever find the answer to it all ?

You can see by scanning things at night
You can move controlled while you think twice
But can you feel in a way of humanity ?
When your hypnotic eyes decide to make it real

Still in memory the danger of minority
Can`t you see the line into I should fall
And disappear ?
You`re beside your mind in a mission without aim
There`s no need to feel anymore
Can`t you see my eyes
Electronic eyes - I can read your mind
Do we really need the answer to it all ?
Electronic eyes see all
but they will never read between the lines
