I have seen a thousand dreams 
believe me they were real
I have touched the skys in foreign lands
It seemed as if they were friends of mine
Do they belong to me ?

I made my days with hands embraced 
While shadows cover the way I go 
To get the choice to choose my place
Reminds me of what my father said :
"You don`t belong to me" 
Do I belong somewhere at all ?

How many roads how many dreams
Led into the night ?
It`s getting so hard to find!
End of a mile - the start of a new
No one is immune
To the longing for other lands
It`s an odyssey it`s my own desire
Do I have roots to return to ?

Certain skys and secret ways
All the things we don`t understand
We waste our lives and sell our dreams 
but were we do belong I don`t know
Do they belong to me ?

How many roads how many dreams
Led into the night ?
It`s getting so hard to find!
End of a mile - the start of a new
No one is immune
To the longing for other lands
It`s an odyssey it`s my own desire
Tell me where I do belong ...

How many roads how many dreams
Discover the truth and bury the lies 
It`s not the same to be where your roots are 
Or just anywhere
