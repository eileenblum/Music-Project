Sometimes I feel they all talk me down
"Always do this ! - Don`t go astray
Or move far away from here!"
Can't stand all the million voices
Talking to me on a silent wavelength
What is the answer for me ?
Because I don`t want to be as they want me to
Nobody knows who I am, nobody knows....

We are in disguise tonight - flowing with the tide
There must be a part of me chasing everyone
And your head spins round and round
Some of the people they walk undercover
And there is no-one waiting
I never wanted to be in the frontline
When I see you behind me

Who's inside ?
Take me to the shattered ones we left behind
We all know it`s true - we live a stranger`s life
We are hiding the core like a blame

moonlight in sight - nightmares appear:
I am the only one who can see what`s really going on
What is the answer for me ?
Because I don`t want to be as they want me to
Nobody knows who I am, nobody knows....

We are in disguise tonight - chasing everyone
There must be a part of me flowing with the tide
And your head spins round and round
Some of the people they walk undercover
And there is no-one waiting
I never wanted to be as they want me to
When I see you behind me
