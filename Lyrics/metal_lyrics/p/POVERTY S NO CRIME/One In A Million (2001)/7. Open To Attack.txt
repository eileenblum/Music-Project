You ! - Can I hide behind your face ?
And I won`t appear as I am
Through the coldness in your eyes
I was too shy to speak my name
When I saw the endless crowd.....

You wear that uniform again
Though I don`t agree - let me in
I was naked in the light
So I refuse to be open - no !

If this world is a fair place
We don`t let it show
People hurt each other
Everywhere I go
Exposure as a pastime
This is when I frown
Easy to get under
Won`t you do it again - to me again ?

You cannot hide behind my face
Because a leaf has covered my skin
And no-one is unfaltering
But we don`t know how to show

If this world is a fair place
We don`t let it show
People hurt each other
Everywhere I go
If this world is a diamond
We must let it shine
A gift from one to another
Won`t you do it again - to me again
