I fell into a black hole
The ones I used to know
Had been leaving me alone

When I've got to stop the way we used to see the times we had
I won`t be be the same anymore

You and I were always between
The things I never saw
The stranger isn`t me...

When I've got to stop the way we used to see the times we had
I won`t be be the same anymore

No-one belongs to anyone we have to stand alone !
Moments return to nowhere so what will be the same?
No-one belongs to anyone and no-one is a friend
Ashes return to ashes - I tried until the end

Way to nowhere - we have come so far
For some cold reason we have drifted apart
When your life`s changing don`t believe in what they say!
The streets of sorrow they will end up right here !

Way to nowhere you won`t lead me to
The doors of fortune and things made of gold
Inspiration fills me up again
Though my life is changing - I won`t be a different man

Shout it out when you feel abused
Everything can change
But the stranger will remain

But I've got to keep my faith when they decide to let me down
I`ll be the same as before
I have got to keep my faith when they decide to let me down
I`ll be the same as before

You won`t blind me - I can see this
Though you deceived my mind
I`ll be the same as before...............
