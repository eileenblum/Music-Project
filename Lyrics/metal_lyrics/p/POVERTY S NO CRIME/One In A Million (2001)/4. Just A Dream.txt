Into the distance - far from anywhere
I looked into a fairytale, a place of pleasure
The child inside me `still hungry for the day

A late encounter - I foresee the memories that will appear

I can`t believe it`s over
I can`t believe it`s just a dream
Your life is freezing halfway
You have to learn to be a man

I'm damned to be much older than I feel
And realize the childhood that I leave
Out of my window - a glimpse of what I ?ve been
Somehow they killed the boy I used to be

One magic moment fills my heart with greed
Light in the darkness - see me playing on the fields of summer
I left my childhood sooner than I wanted to
I can`t rewind it and I can`t live forever and a day

I can`t believe it`s over
I can`t believe it`s just a dream
Your life is freezing halfway
You have to learn to be a man
I can`t rewind - stop looking back!
Nothing remains.........
