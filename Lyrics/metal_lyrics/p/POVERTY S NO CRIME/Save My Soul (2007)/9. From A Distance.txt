when I look around now what do I see
the faces around they won't answer me
the bit I know is just a part of entirety
show me a place from where I can see all
take me to places above, take me away

when I look around I stop making a move
people as far as my eyes can see
I feel the world is passing me by
take me to somewhere out in the sky
where I can see all
take me to places above, take me away

The world I know the ways that I go
Won't take me away to a foreign sight
I spread my wings and fly as high as a satellite
Circle around like a bird of prey

Can you see something
Right when you look into the light
Let's take a view from a distance
Right into the mist of the night

See the sunrise - raise your head
Keep your distance - break your window pane

When I look around I stop taking a breath
I'm breaking the seal of secrecy
The people around they just walk on by
Measure the size of an empty space

So tired of feeling something
So tired of the tragical life
Let's take a view from a distance
Right into the mist of the night

Will you follow/ will you care?
Will you sorrow? Will you dare?
