all we get to know
arise out of a source of nowhere
a wounded place to hide
that lives inside your mind
god only knows...
what else could I feat to show

the key to creativity
is not a gift of time
it depends on anyone in the course of time
the sense of harmony - can it ease my mind?

words so alive
like a picture from a dream of someone
songs like a strike
they seem so hard to find

god only knows...

to suffer is the key to creativity
it's not the peace inside
the source of melodies - can it ease my mind?
it depends on anything spinning around my head

when I'm in between trial and failure
when I'm in between false and right
I'm waiting for inspiration from a soul of sanity
another victim of the emptiness?

the key to creativity
is not a gift of time
the source of melodies - can it ease my mind?
it depends on anyone spinning around my head
