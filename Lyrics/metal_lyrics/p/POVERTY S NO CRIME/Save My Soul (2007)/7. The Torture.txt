slow - sorrow has taken control
shadows are approaching me
a torture that no one can tell
is taking possession of me

fight...fight with the strength of your mind
show me the way to hell
touching the skin of my soul
slow down the speed of this game

now and then
the torture seems to never end
go insane
will this torture bring my inner strength?

now a shadow has darken the sun
I'm starting a silent run
measure the power to grow
to hold out for the rest of my life

now and then
the torture seems to never end
go insane
evil can you spell my name?
now and then reach your hand out to the sky
win outright
the suffer ends the day you'll you pass away
