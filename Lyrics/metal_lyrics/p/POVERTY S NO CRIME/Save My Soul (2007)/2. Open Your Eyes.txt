abused by you - can't stand upright
so dead tired - awake in the night
fake my world - state of confusion
waste my time - I'm forced to comply

open your eyes
see through the dust in your sight
something like truth in disguise
the door is open wide
feelings get lost in your mind
the curse of the moment remains

selfish life - only illusive
sense of sight - a man with a child's eye
instant fall away
live my life the way it's meant to be
take my soul
you fake my world and waste my time
you make me wan to die

open your eyes
see through the dust in your sight
memories they melt in your mind
the door is open wide
feelings get lost in your life
the curse of the moment remains

end the fight - stand aside - take me as I am
my hands are tied - I stake my life
to open up my eyes
get me now - make-believe
save me from the fall
you take my soul - you fake my world
and waste my time - won't leave me as I am
