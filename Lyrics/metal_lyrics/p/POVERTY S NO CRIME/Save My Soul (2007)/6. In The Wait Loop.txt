so the days they come and they go
waiting for a moment out of your life

as the day turned into a bow
can't you see time has taken your gold

day follows the day
time without time-waste away
haze-wasted away
follow the trace - I am lazing away

so your chance go round in a wire
there have been a thousand times of goodbye

as the day starts the same as before
so much lazy days I've been wasting away

day follows the day
time without time-wasted away
haze-day after day
going ahead - I am fading away

so you break the fence of the days
looking for a million places to go

every smile will hurt in your face
every little move is like the same as before
