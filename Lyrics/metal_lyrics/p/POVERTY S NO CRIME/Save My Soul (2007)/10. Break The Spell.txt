I know my life is a cynical, logical place
I know the meaning sys hold out to stay in this race
Waiting for someone or something to show me the way
Save me from drowning in something I cannot explain

I know this feeling will likely persist for a while
I know this fever will go down the day that I die
Move in slow motion my hands felt just like two balloons
Waiting for someone or something to take me away

Fear inside - break the spell tonight
Always a moment your run out of time

I know this feeling is momentary state passing by
Sorrow will cover the colour of each others life
Sometimes my life is a journey with no place to hide
One more step closer to something I cannot explain

Fear inside - break the spell tonight
Always a phase where you run out of mind

I close my eyes and I hope that this feeling will change
Walking on thin ice I am crashing into holes of my life
Move in slow motion will help me to balance my day
Silence and tension - I thought that my fight was in vain

Fear inside - break the spell tonight
Facing the moment where you feel the
Fear inside - break the spell tonight
There is always a shelter for you
Fear inside you break the silence
Always one solution you can try
