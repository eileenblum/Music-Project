counting days at night
wasting so much time
I've played all my cards
in a senseless game

so unkind - no way out can be found
I take up time - to make my mind up

drown inside a mess
I wish myself away
while there's life, there's hope,
"can't you see?"

end in sight - the aim to fight for
will you take care? Will you be there?

this time I dare to relieve
to end the days on my own
sunlight won't heal
a heart that won't feel
no one can save me - tomorrow is the end

I'm feeling so unrest
in this breathless chase
life has passed me by
I lock the door
my end in sight - the aim to fight for

this time I dare to relieve
to bring this life to an end
will you take care?
will you be there?
sharing the pain but tomorrow is the end
in sight
