Screaming with the bloodlust
Carnage all around
Laying waste to all who come
Their bodies on the ground
Pounding like a hammer
All those in my way
I crush their bones beneath my heel
I am the war machine

Run in fear, your doom is here
No retreat from the war machine

Saints or sinners fall around me
No one will survive
I smell their blood upon the air
Their fear before they die

Run in fear, your hell is here
Your defeat from the war machine

I was built a thousand years ago
To rage throughout the land
I bring destruction to the world
Created to crush man

Run in fear, your hell is here
Your defeat from the war machine
