I'm not fucking down with you
All the crap from your bullshit crew
Don't wanna be a part of things you do
Fuck you and your point of view

You're telling me you're the master race
Well I believe you're the world's disgrace
Hollow lies, facist salutes
Fuck you and your point of view

Left, right on you march
You're from a bygone age
Ain't you heard the news
There ain't no master race

How many died in World War Two
Fuck you and your point of view

Left, right on you march
Reliving glory days
Ain't you heard the news
There ain't no master race
Sieg heil, hands held high
Wipe you out without a trace
Persecute cunts like you
I hope that hell awaits
Puta
Fuck you

I'm not fucking down with you
All the crap from your bullshit crew
Don't wanna be a part of things you do
Fuck you and your point of view

Left, right on you march
Reliving glory days
Ain't you heard the news
There ain't no master race
Sieg heil, hands held high
Wipe you out without a trace
Persecute cunts like you
I hope that hell awaits
Fuck you
