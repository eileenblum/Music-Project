Everytime I try to do things right
Another fucker's got me in their sights
But here I go, here I go, I'm ready for another round
Everyday I think, ok, today is gonna be the day
Then boom, I feel the blast but I don't hear the sound

It ain't safe to walk my streets
Never trust the people that I meet
Wanna dig myself a hole, hide underground
What the fuck do you want from me
Always give me so much grief
I already hold the cards form hell

I'm dog dead, shot down
My head's up, mutha fucker
I won't stay down
I'm dog dead, shot down
My head's up, mutha fucker
I won't stay down

I believe you're afraid of me
I don't have your lame beliefs
But I won't change mine, just so we are friends
If it's right I'll take it on
It's all about where your heart belongs
So if you piss me off, then it's one to one

I'm dog dead, shot down
My head's up, mutha fucker
I won't stay down
I'm dog dead, shot down
My head's up, mutha fucker
I won't stay down

I'll always do what I believe in
I'll always try to make life change
You always fuck with people's freedom
Try to shoot me down in flames
Fuck you

Everytime I try to do things right
Another fucker's got me in their sights
But here I come, here I go
Everyday I'm ready for another round
Fuck you

Everytime I try to do things right
Another fucker's got me in their sights
But here I go, here I go, I'm ready for another round
Everyday I think, ok, today is gonna be the day
Then boom, I feel the blast but I don't hear the sound

It ain't safe to walk my streets
Never trust the people that I meet
Wanna dig myself a hole, hide underground
What the fuck do you want from me
Always give me so much grief
I already hold the cards form hell

I'm dog dead, shot down
My head's up, mutha fucker
I won't stay down
I'm dog dead, shot down
My head's up, mutha fucker
I won't stay down
Dog dead
Shot down

I believe you're afraid of me
I don't have your lame beliefs
But I won't change mine, just so we are friends
If it's right I'll take it on
It's all about where your heart belongs
So if you piss me off, it's one to one

Everytime I try to do things right
Another fucker's got me in their sights
But here I go, here I go, I'm ready for another round

I'm dog dead, shot down
My head's up, mutha fucker
I won't stay down
I'm dog dead
