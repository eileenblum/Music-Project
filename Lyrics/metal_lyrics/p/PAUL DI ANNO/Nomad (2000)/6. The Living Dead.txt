The night returns, shadows fall
A cold wind blows, I stand alone
A thousand voices, ghosts that call my name

Tears came once, so long ago
Been offered love, my heart was cold
Now in this life, I just don't know how to love

I walk through this hell that I made my own
No flames in the darkness, I have no soul
I have no future but always to roam alone

Don't cry for me, the nightmares I've seen
The pain inside me, I'm the living dead

The cries of the hungry cut deep to the bone
A crucified prophet, dead on his throne
He died for his people
But I have no one, I walk alone

Don't cry for me, the nightmares I've seen
The pain inside me, I'm the living dead

I walk through this hell that I made my own
No flames in the darkness, I have no soul
I have no future but always to roam alone

Don't cry for me, the nightmares I've seen
The pain inside me, I'm the living dead
Don't cry for me, the nightmares I've seen
The pain inside me, I'm the living dead
