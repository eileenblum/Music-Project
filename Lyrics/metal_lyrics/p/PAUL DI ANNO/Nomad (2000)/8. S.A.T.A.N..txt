Satan

I'll poison your mind, fool
I'll spread my disease
I'm the cancer within you
On your fear I feed
I'm the prince of the darkness
Do you know my name
S.A.T.A.N., fall to your knees

In wars I will guide you, in misery I trade
The bullet with your name on, I'll weep at your grave
I'm the keeper of your nightmares, spit in your face
S.A.T.A.N. evil

Beat the wings of hellions
The gateway to my world

I will be your true friend, I'll be with you for life
Cry when your children die, and then I fuck your wife
S.A.T.A.N. or diablo sounds nice
I can give you all you want, all you do is sign

You know my
I'm your worst nightmare, Diablo is my name
Evil
