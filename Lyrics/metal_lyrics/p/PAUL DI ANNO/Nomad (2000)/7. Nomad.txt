I move around the world, seeking peace but finding none
A thousand cries for help but no pity underneath the sun
I have seen a world where nobody gives a damn
Shed your tears of blood children, all join hands to die

Scar upon scar, pain upon pain
Building layers high upon my back
Rage against race, the world becomes my cage
Never finding hope, I'm trapped

Nomad
Searching for a place where I can hide
Nomad
Praying to a god I cannot find

I've seen death after death, nations in fear
Bones of children scattered on the ground
Arrow turns to gun, gun turns to bomb
What has man achieved throughout the years

Nomad
Searching for a place where I can hide
Nomad
Praying to a god I cannot find

How many deaths, when will it end
Religion's now an enemy, it used to be a friend
Burn them for their lies, then we become like them
I turn my back upon the world, another blood millenium

Nomad
Searching for a place where I can hide
Nomad
Praying to a god I cannot find
Nomad
Searching for a place where I can hide
Nomad
Praying to a god I cannot find

Scar upon scar, pain upon pain
Building layers high upon my back
Rage against race, the world becomes my cage
I'm never finding hope, I'm trapped

Death after death, nations in fear
Bones of children scattered on the ground
Arrow turns to gun, gun turns to bomb
What has man achieved throughout the years

Nomad
Searching for a place where I can hide
Nomad
Praying to a god I cannot find

I move around the world, seeking peace but finding none
A thousand cries for help but no pity underneath the sun

Nomad
