I didn't believe this could happen to me
That I'd fall so far and so deep
My hopes all went bust, lying there in the dust
But I'll always get back on my feet

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
A little muscle, lots of pain
Battle hardened, take the strain
I am still the man

In my world I'm king, if you want to get in
You must always believe in the plan

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
A little muscle, lots of pain
Battle hardened, take the strain
El Hombre is the name, motherfucker

I didn't believe this could happen to me
That I'd fall so far and so deep
My hopes all went bust, lying there in the dust
But I'll always get back on my feet

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
A little muscle, lots of pain
Battle hardened, take the strain
I am still the man

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
A little muscle, lots of pain
Battle hardened, take the strain
I am still the man
I am still the man
I am still the man
