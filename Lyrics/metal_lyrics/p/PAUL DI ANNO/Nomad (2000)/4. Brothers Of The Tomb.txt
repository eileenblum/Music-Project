Run to the dark, away from the light
Contorted with anger, ready to fight
Years of oppression, cast off these chains
We strike as one, we die or be slaves

Whipped until bleeding, many have died
Ruled by a tyrant, taken at night
Into his temple, brought to our knees
Begging for mercy, so our children can live

We were born enslaved
From the cradle to the grave
We begin the fight
Brothers of the tomb arise
Tears of blood will fall
Time for us to take control
Our kind must survive
Brothers of the tomb unite

Free from our shacles, free from his pain
Death to the man whose dreams are insane
Torn to the dark, hate in our eyes
His body lies broken, his kingdom destroyed

We were born enslaved
From the cradle to the grave
We begin the fight
Brothers of the tomb arise
Tears of blood will fall
Time for us to take control
Our kind must survive
Brothers of the tomb unite

Run to the dark, away from the light
Contorted with anger, ready to fight
Years of oppression, cast off these chains
We strike as one, die or be slaves

We were born enslaved
From the cradle to the grave
We begin the fight
Brothers of the tomb arise
Tears of blood will fall
Time for us to take control
Our kind must survive
Brothers of the tomb unite

Free from our shacles, free from his pain
Death to the man whose dreams are insane
Torn to the dark, hate in our eyes
His body lies broken, his kingdom destroyed
