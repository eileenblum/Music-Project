I don't want to hear
I don't want to see
I wish I was blind, burn my eyes
I don't to speak
I've no more to say
I can't even scream, struck dumb

All the nightmares I have seen
All the lies I once believed
Now lock me up, hide me away
I'm the mad man in the attic

I've seen children die
I've heard countries lie
I've seen rivers running red
I saw peace leave, I had their disease
I won't ever not forget

I've not seen all this today
For years it's eaten me away
Now my soul's a rotting grave
I'm the mad man in the attic

Look around, see what I see
It's not the way the world's supposed to be
Humanity is now replaced by greed
See the scars upon your knees
Can you taste the shit you have to eat
Eat some more so you can be like them

I don't want to hear
I don't want to see
I wish I was blind, burn my eyes
I don't to speak
I've no more to say
I can't even scream, struck dumb

All the nightmares I have seen
All the lies I once believed
Now lock me up, hide me away
I'm the mad man in the attic

I'm the mad man in the attic
