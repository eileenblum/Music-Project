In blood we trust!
In blood we trust!
In blood we trust - Halleluja!

Blessed are the souls of the dead
For we will drink them tomorrow
Breaker of sorrows and bread
red is the water we borrow

Hail, hail, lifeless and pale
Hey, ho, undead and male

Father, oh father
Come fill up my grail!

In blood we trust!
In blood we trust!
In blood we trust - Halleluja!

Blessed are the hearts of the sad
The sin of the Christian believer
Soon we return from the dead
To still our blood craving fever

Hail, hail, lifeless and pale
Hey, ho, undead and male

In blood we trust!
In blood we trust!
In blood we trust - Halleluja!

Oh - In blood, in blood we trust
Oh - In blood, in blood we trust
