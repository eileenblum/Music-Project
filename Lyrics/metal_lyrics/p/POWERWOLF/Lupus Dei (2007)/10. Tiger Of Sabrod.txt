At night in the forrest of Sabrod
A tiger in search of his prey
I wonder will we be alive by the dawning of day?

Predator of godly creation
In hunger he stops at no child
Obsessed by the fever to follow the call of the wild

Take this life
And you're safe
Say goodbye for today

It's the tiger of Sabrod
And he's fighting from the heart
Will you return?

Tiger of Sabrod
Oh - Tiger of Sabrod

The eyes of the tiger are closed now
And lifeless he lies in the mud
Don't trust in your triumoh and glory
Revenge will bring blood

At night he will raise from the dead ones
And then he will search you all night and day
The wolf will still live on tomorrow - Survivors will pay!

Take this life
And you're safe
Say goodbye for today

It's the tiger of Sabrod
And he's fighting from the heart
Will you return?

Tiger of Sabrod
Oh - Tiger of Sabrod
