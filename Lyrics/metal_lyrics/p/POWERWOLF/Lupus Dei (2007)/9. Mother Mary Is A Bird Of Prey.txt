When your time is over
And we come down to take you away
You better pray to Jesus
May the serpents of god lead your way

And when you find salvation
In revelation
This is the son of the earth

And the you cross the liar.
The devil's fire
Mother as sign of rebirth

Mother mary is a bird of prey
Bird of prey
Bird of prey

When your life is over
And the angels are falling from grace
And in the eyes of Judas
You're born on the darkest of days

An when you find elation
Illumination
You are the son of the earth
And then you kill the liar.
In Satan's fire
Hell is a sign of rebirth

Mother mary is a bird of prey
Bird of prey
Bird of prey

Stand up and pray!
