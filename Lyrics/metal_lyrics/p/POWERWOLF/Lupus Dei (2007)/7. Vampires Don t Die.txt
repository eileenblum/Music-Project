Out in the night, the masters of fright
Pray for our souls are undead

Bodies to feed, your blood's what we need
We come when you're lying in bed

You can't destroy us, can't blind us with light
cursed by the desire to follow the might

You can't escape us, so don't even try
But there's one thing you just can't deny

Vampires don't die - Ohhhh
Vampires don't die - Ohhhh
Vampires don't die

Time for the beast, all hell is unleashed
Cry when we drink of your wine

No drop remains, we open your veins
We leave when the sun starts to shine

You can't erase us, can't move when we bite
Don't dare to fool us, we know if you lie

You can't escape us, so don't even try
But there's one thing you just can't deny

Vampires don't die - Ohhhh
Vampires don't die - Ohhhh
Vampires don't die
