A martyr dies for Jesus Christ
The altar burning as the demons rise

The word defied, the crucified
The sermon spoken on a bloodred night

The holy whore they're fighting for
Like lambs to slaughter in a bible war

Oh - Victims of the night
It's time to say your

Prayer in the dark
Prayer in the dark

Ave Maria, gracia plena
Ave Maria, mother of god

The Preacher's call to tell you all
He saw damnation in his crystal ball

The icon torn, all hope forlorn
When hell is rising and the dark reborn

Oh - Demons of the night
It's time to say your

Prayer in the dark
Prayer in the dark

(Ave Maria, gracia plena
Ave Maria, mother of god)

Benedicta, sancta mater
Amen.

Pray, pray, pray in the dark
pray, pray, pray in the dark
Amen.
