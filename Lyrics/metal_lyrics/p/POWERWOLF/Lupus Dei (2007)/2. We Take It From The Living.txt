We came out of storm and nightmare
Of blood and snow
Are you guided by the bible?
I want to know...

Would you die for Heavy Metal?
Then hear our call
Raise your horns for master Satan
Till the heavens fall

We take it from the living!

We came out of dark and fire
From down below
All we need is merchandisers
I want to know

Will you die for Heavy Metal?
We'd sell you all
Raise your notes for great consume
In our metal mall

We take it from the living!
