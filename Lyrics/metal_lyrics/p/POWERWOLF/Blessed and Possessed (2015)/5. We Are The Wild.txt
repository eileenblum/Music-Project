At the end of our time we stand
hold the cross by the iron hand
holy Christ in your command
we call on the dark
Be the last of the human kind
with no blood in you heart and mind
alone into fire we walk

If we come all before you wake
pray the lord your soul to take
for your blood will build a lake
sing Halleluja
In the night when you rest your head
and we rise up from the dead
unholy and fallen we are

Wild, wild, we are the wild
wild, wild, break out and cry
wild, wild, you are the wild
and till the morning
stand up and fight

We are the wild
and after midnight we're alive
can't stop the wild
forever born to hail the night

In the dark of the night we pray
for the dawn of the final day
for unlight to guide the way
and god take our hand
Overhead where the demons die
and the daylight blinds the eye
alone on the pyre we stand

In the daytime seek to hide
till at sundown we unite
to begin the sacrifice
scream Halleluja
Ride the storm and raise your fist
celebrate the Eucharist
go out in the night for we are

Wild, wild, we are the wild
wild, wild, break out and cry
wild, wild, you are the wild
and till the morning
stand up and fight

We are the wild
and after midnight we're alive
can't stop the wild
forever born to hail the night

We are the wild
until the morning we survive
can't stop the wild
for we are born to win the fight

We are the wild
