In the night we break the sorrow
in the night we come alive
in the night Adrenalin is higher than heaven

In the night with no tomorrow
in the night demons are
in the night when carnal lust is higher than heaven

The cross on your wall, and demons inside
come raise my sword to heaven
The night to be fall the pulse of the tide
the bell did strike eleven

And when the night has come
no, we never will return
where the mortal pray resurrection
When the light has gone
in the sacristy we turn up high... and wake

In the night we break the sorrow
in the night we come alive
in the night Adrenalin is higher than heaven

In the night with no tomorrow
in the night demons are
in the night when carnal lust is higher than heaven

We call on the dark, the lord by our side
take on the cross in heaven
We ride till we fall, unbroken we die
we strike by force of seven

And when the night has come
no, we never will return
where the mortal pray resurrection
When the light has gone
in the sacristy we turn up high... and wake

The sundown we call, in twilight we hide
the night we still remember
We pray for them all, and restless we fight
We never will surrender

And when the night has come
no, we never will return
where the mortal pray resurrection
When the light has gone
in the sacristy we turn up high... and wake

In the night we break the sorrow
in the night we come alive
in the night Adrenalin is higher than heaven

In the night with no tomorrow
in the night demons are
in the night when carnal lust is higher than heaven
