Stand up for God
In the land of the fire
Bring on the madness
You're born to destroy
Beyond the trail
Of tartarean riders
Armata strigoi

Before the morning
Can break we retire
The searing heat
Of the sun we a void
Await the dark
Proud walachian fighters
Armata strigoi

We are the stormbound
The avatar
We are the sons of God and sorrow
We are the ones who see
No tomorrow
Suck up!
Armata de strigoi

We hall the cross
And we kill
By the bible
For seven sins
Are defined to deploy
Along the front
Of moldavian strikes
Armata strigoi

We pray for mercy
Of mater maria
The sacred lie
Who gave birth to the boy
We drink the blood
Of the fallen believer
Armata strigoi

We are the stormbound
The avatar
We are the sons of God and sorrow
We are the ones who see
No tomorrow
Suck up!
Armata de strigoi

We are the stormbound
The avatar
We are the sons of God and sorrow
We are the ones who see
No tomorrow
Suck up!
Armata de strigoi
