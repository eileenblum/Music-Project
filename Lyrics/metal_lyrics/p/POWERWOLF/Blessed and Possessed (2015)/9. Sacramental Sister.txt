Bow down my sister, you've taken the veil
locked up desire and buried your grail
Christ in your heart and the poison in mind
merciful father bring light to the blind
Carry the cross under sacred command
when down your body the priars descend

Sacramental sister, in heaven or hell
when the night is falling, no moral can tell
Sacramental sister, to god you are sworn
when desire are calling, the Bible is torn

Sacramental sister
in the darkest night
Sacramental sister
in the act we saw you alive
Sacramental sister
do the morning star
Sacramental sister
let him take you far
to the light
Sacramental sister!

Inside the order and out of control
corpus for sin and to heaven the soul
fallen for sin by the breaking of bread
lamb on the altar and werewolf in bed

Sacramental sister, in heaven or hell
when the night is falling, no moral can tell
Sacramental sister, impure to the bone
dedicate your body to god all alone

Sacramental sister
in the darkest night
Sacramental sister
in the act we saw you alive
Sacramental sister
do the morning star
Sacramental sister
let him take you far
to the light
Sacramental sister!

Sacramental sister
in the darkest night
Sacramental sister
in the act we saw you alive
Sacramental sister
you were led astray
Sacramental sister
in the light of dawn
you will pray
Sacramental sister!
