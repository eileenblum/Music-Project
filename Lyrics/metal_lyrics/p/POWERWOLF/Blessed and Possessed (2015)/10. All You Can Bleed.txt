All night, fill me up
for the harvest of your veins we seek you
Outright, spill the sap, all alone where we appear
Don't you try to hide
by the sermon of the holy week,
you're born to cast aside, see the final time is near

Ex Christus, Ex corpus
sanguinem malum
Ex sanguis, sanctorum
sacramental greed

All you can bleed
in the sacrament of god we drink up
all you can bleed
no remorse
all you can bleed
in the midnight mass we celebrate you
all you can bleed
Christ by force

Break up, draw the line
to the underworld where we belong, you
can't stop, might divine, we are spineless when you bleed
inflame dynamite
for the mind is weak and lust is strong, all
mores, we override, for we are the undead seed

Ex Christus, Ex corpus
sanguinem malum
Ex sanguis, sanctorum
sacramental greed

All you can bleed
in the sacrament of god we drink up
all you can bleed
no remorse
all you can bleed
in the midnight mass we celebrate you
all you can bleed
Christ by force

All you can bleed
sanguis in dominus
All you can bleed
Halleluja
All you can bleed
sanguis in dominus
All you can bleed
Halleluja

All you can bleed
in the sacrament of god we drink up
all you can bleed
no remorse
all you can bleed
in the midnight mass we celebrate you
all you can bleed
Christ by force
