Bring me pandemonium
Speak the word of God
All we need in life is flesh and blood
Bring me sanctimonium
Armageddon flood
All we care is how to get more blood

Stand up
So latisaro
Stand up
E saro naio
Stand up
So latisaro

Lust for blood
Inside us
Blood
Unite us
Call forever lust for blood

We don't need no pentagram
We don't pray to God
All we need in life is human blood
Man we die for what we have done
Or go down in flood
All we lust and hunger for is blood
All we need is lust for blood
All we need is lust

Stand up
E saro naio
Stand up
So latisaro

Lust for blood
Inside us
Blood
Unite us
Call forever lust for blood
