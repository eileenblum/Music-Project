In nomine veritas
In nomine filii et patris
In nomine veritas
Et sanctus 
Amen and Attack

Stand your ground against the storm
And hail the crucified
Eins zwei amen &amp; attack
Army of the Bible sworn
Defend us through the night
Drei vier - amen &amp; attack

When the night is cold and black
We sing amen &amp; attack
And we lead the storm of the wild
Be the wildest of the pack
Scream it! Amen &amp; attack
And we fight with God on our side
Amen &amp; attack
Amen &amp; attack

Fight the demons of this world
No victims left to hide
Eins zwei amen &amp; attack
Make them pray or make them pay
It's time to stand up right
Drei vier - amen &amp; attack

When the night is cold and black
We sing amen &amp; attack
And we lead the storm of the wild
Be the wildest of the pack
Scream it! Amen &amp; attack
And we fight with god on our side
Amen &amp; attack
Amen &amp; attack
