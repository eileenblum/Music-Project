New blood in our veins and Bible in hand
Haleluja amen
From heaven we are and to hell we are sent
Haleluja amen
The father the son the cross we defend
Haleluja amen
Together we fall and united we stand
Haleluja amen
We hide beneath the sacrament
In nights of holy blood
In light we die
The prophecy of God

And we all die in the night
For the secrets of the sacristy
Hide to survive in the dark

We pray all our lives until we die in the end
Haleluja amen
The weight of the cross when to hell we descend
Haleluja amen
We write our fate in testaments
We sign the words with blood
Unite the sky the requiem of God

And we all die in the night
For the secrets of the sacristy
Hide to survive in the dark
