Peccatum
Cantatum
Extatum et oratum
Peccatum cantatum nomine
Patrum
Nomine partum

Call the sons of Acheron
The leaders of Iesaia
All the hordes of Babylon
The heretics who praise the lier
Brothers of Tiberius
The reign of blood and fire
Sanctify the virgin son
The prophet of the bible choir

Run far from the sun
War has begun
Into the final fire
Run far from the sun
Into the eye of the storm
Saw the rites of Golgotha

The torment of your trial
Crucify the fallen son
The sacrament before denial
Brothers of Samaria
The armaments of true
Sent to burn the holy one
Born to set the world on fire

Run far from the sun
War has begun
Into the final fire
Run far from the sun
Into the eye of the storm
