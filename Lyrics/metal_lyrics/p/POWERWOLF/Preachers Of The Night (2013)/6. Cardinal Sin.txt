Cardinal
In deum
Et sanctus
Cardinal
Descend to hell

The cardinal opens the church in the night
All dressed in his black velvet cape
The sinners will act as religion demands
All sins are confessed in his grace
At midnight he came
Confession his game
And no one could hear when they scream
Believe in the shame and carry the blame
No crime was seen

They call him cardinal sin
In the night
Cardinal Sin
Blind in light
They locked him in for cardinal sin
At midnight he came to kill 
At midnight the trial will begin

The cardinal hides in the dark of the dome
No mortal can witness his name
He died for the lust of the flesh and the bone
The curse of the beast he became
At midnight he killed
Your blood will be spilled
And no one can hear when you cry
Possessed by the game
And blessed in his name before you die

They call him cardinal sin
In the night
Cardinal Sin
Blind in light
They locked him in for cardinal sin
At midnight he came to kill 
At midnight the trial will begin

Cardinal
To hell with cardinal
No mercy
Cardinal
Descend to hell
