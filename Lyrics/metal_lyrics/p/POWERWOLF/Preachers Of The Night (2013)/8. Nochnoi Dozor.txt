Into the Taiga
Deep in the dark
The land of the wild at your hand
Blood in your veins and bible in mind
We conquer the unpromised land
Into the fire
No turning back
Right down from god we are sent
To hell with the sun and to heaven the blade
With no mortal crime to repent

Fire
We came to set the world on fire
We came to get together high upon the dark
Forever die with the sword in your hand

Deep in the wildside
Onward we march
Cursed are the frozen alive
Bearing the frost like the devil the praise
Reborn by the will to survive
Into the darkness onward we ride
The curse of our hunger to still
Longing for blood with mercy in mind
And right after midnight we kill

Fire
We came to set the world on fire
We came to get together high upon the dark
Forever die with the sword in your hand
