The blood-red moon is shining
And outside in the still
Creatures of the night arise
Get ready for the kill

The voices in the darkness
Sirens in the air
Crying and now so can hear
The screams of your despair

Living on a nightmare
Living on a nightmare
Your soul carried on
When we have gone

Living on a nightmare
(Nightmare, nightmare!
Nightmare, nightmare!)

Gruesome steps behind you
Electrify the nerves
Youâre paralyzed, the end is near
Youâll get what you deserve

Your home will be the graveyard
Your crypt my lifeless hand
The end in sight, for hell is near
Youâll see the very end

Nightmare, nightmare!
I saw you take your night and so
Nightmare
Before the dawn

Living on a nightmare
Living on a nightmare
Your soul carried on
When we have gone

Living on a nightmare

Living on a nightmare
Heavy metal nightmare
Your soul they will burn
When you return

Living on a nightmare
(Nightmare, nightmare!)
