The phantom, the phantom,
The phantom, the phantom,
The phantom, the phantom rising

For the cross we all would die
On the way to Golgotha
Raise your fist and don't think twice
Murder Judas in the night
For Jesus Christ, the laws of the underworld
Jesus Christ, have taken all control

Fight your fight
Phantom of funeral
Side by side
Out of the darkest night
Fight your fight
Will you believe today
Your religion, the fortune to pray

Blood was raining from the sky
Seven demons in the light
We storm the gate, the order right
When we pray at night, I told you
Jesus Christ, the lord of the second birth
Jesus Christ, I take you at your word

Fight your fight
Phantom of funeral
Side by side
Out of the darkest night
Fight your fight
Will you believe today
Your religion, the fortune to pray

Mind your head, the phantom of the dead!

Phantom! Phantom! Phantom of the funeral
Phantom! Phantom! Phantom of the funeral
Phantom! Phantom! Phantom of the funeral
Phantom! Phantom! Phantom of the funeral
