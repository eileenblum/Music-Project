When I'm crawling through the night
God and Satan by my side
And I'm haunted in the dark
Sacramentum of the wild
Evil born as human child
Seed of wolf and man we are

You are like the dead alive
And you seal the time you die
Hear the call behind the dark
You can hide and start the run
When the seventh night has come
And you realize the mark
Are you taken all alone
Holy Christ in flesh and bone
Pray, the werewolves left the ark

See it's not a sermon, they can't call me back
And when the moon is high, we call the pack - we attack!

This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive

Like a rebel in the war
We have seen the night before
And we call the morning star
Are you frightened all the more
You can't hide behind a door
Dead and sanctified you are

See I'm not a sacred victim in despair
And when the fever calls, the pack is there - so beware

This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive

This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out alive
This is the night of the werewolves
Run for your life
This is the night
Never get out a-, never get out a-, never get out alive
