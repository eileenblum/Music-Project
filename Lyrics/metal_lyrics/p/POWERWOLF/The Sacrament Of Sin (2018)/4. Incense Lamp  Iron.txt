Follow the dead
In the dark of damnation
Pious in head
And a demon at heart
Sword to the night
An evangelist nation
Born
Under the sign of the dark

Gather the wild
Form the horde of the brave men
Brothers allied
Fight the storm of this curse
Banners up high
As we rise like a legion sworn
All for the light
We inverse

Combat ahead
And the night calls for heroes
Ready for fire command
Revel in red
Come and wake up to bring no remorse
Stand up as force

Rise over the dead
Bring us ahead
Incense &amp; Iron
Fight all of the night
Banners up high to the top of the land

Right into the red
All you can get
Incense &amp; Iron
Stand
Follow the fight
Doing the right as we come to defend

Hollow the damned
In the art of salvation
Fallen and banned
And the angels die first
Servant in life
And elated in eden
Cursed
Slaves in the light from beyond

Bury the night in imperial hunger
Do or die
In this fortress of fear
Cannot deny
All the wonders are sacred
Burst
Under the weight of this world

Remedy sent
And the sky falls in treason
Torn by the liar's intent
Devil in head
Come and break out
And raise up the sword
Stand up as horde

Rise over the dead
Bring us ahead
Incense &amp; Iron
Fight all of the night
Banners up high to the top of the land

Right into the red
All you can get
Incense &amp; Iron
Stand
Follow the fight
Doing the right as we come to defend

When we all stand together

Rise over the dead
Bring us ahead
Incense &amp; Iron
Fight all of the night
Banners up high to the top of the land

Right into the red
All you can get
Incense &amp; Iron
Stand
Follow the fight
Doing the right as we come to defend

When we will last forever
