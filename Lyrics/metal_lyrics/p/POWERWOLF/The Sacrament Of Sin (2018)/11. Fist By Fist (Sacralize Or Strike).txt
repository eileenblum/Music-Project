[Latin]

At night we fight as hundred men
In thousand years of war
Loud, and here for blood we're calling
From light away the sacrament
The bible to the core
Proud and standing there forever

[Latin]

Bastards, saints and sinners
We all await the night
Fist by fist
Sacralize our strike
Hurricanes and blizzards
No storm can make us hide
Fist by fist
Sacralize our strike
Fist by fist
Sacralize our strike

[Latin]

We cried aloud for blood revenge
in times of pain and fear
Crowned, and merciless we wander
Despite the final night we ran
Aware the end was near
Bound to iron, god and thunder

[Latin]

Bastards, saints and sinners
We all await the night
Fist by fist
Sacralize our strike
Hurricanes and blizzards
No storm can make us hide
Fist by fist
Sacralize our strike
Fist by fist
Sacralize our strike

[Latin]

Bastards, saints and sinners
Evangelists and knights
Fist by fist
Sacralize our strike
Heretics and killers
The rats will lead the blind
Fist by fist
Sacralized we strike
Fist by fist
Sacralized we strike
Fist by fist
