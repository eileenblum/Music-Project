Find the trail of war and darkness
In the night when they made us all believe
On the way to fate and Gloria
And we never found retreat
Curse the demons in the fortress
When to fight and to force them on their knees
For the lord we pay euphoria
Lead a life, too late to flee

Fire... before the enemies can see
Fire... before the morning
Fire... without a warning you will bleed
Tonight - we still - our need

Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far
Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far

First we take 'em into moonlight
Then we light up a pyre in the maze
And abord the flight to eschaton
May the father lead our way
Born to suffer life immortal
Caught and damned for a light we'll never see
Led astray beyond euphoria
And betrayed as all who pray

Fire... before the enemies can see
Fire... before the morning
Fire... without a warning you will bleed
Tonight - we still - our need

Fire... before the enemies can see
Fire... before the morning
Fire... without a warning you will bleed
Tonight - we still - our need

Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far
Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far
