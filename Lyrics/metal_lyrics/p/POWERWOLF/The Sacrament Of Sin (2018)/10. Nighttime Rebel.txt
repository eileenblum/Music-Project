In the night of surrender
In the full moonlight and the midnight game
Be the ghost, the defender
And of glory be thy name
In the curse of a nightmare
In the end of time fight a hurricane
Be the lightning and thunder
And ignite the final flame

Seven hells, seven demons
Seven murders in the sky
Take your fate in your hand-a
And the sword we rise up high

Nighttime rebel, stand alone against the wind
Nighttime rebel, break the holy sin
Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and let begin
Nighttime rebel, all we ride against the dark
Nighttime rebel, bear a holy heart
Nighttime rebel, summon in the dawn and let begin

In the ongoing darkness
Where the sky is torn and belief has failed
Be the guide, the pretender
And invoke the dread in rain
By the hand of an outlaw
By the flaming sword and the headless veil
Like a wolf, like a phantom
To the cross bound nail by nail

Seven horns, seven daggers
In apocalyptic raid
By the dawn we are fading
Still tonight it's not too late

Nighttime rebel, stand alone against the wind
Nighttime rebel, break the holy sin
Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and let begin
Nighttime rebel, before the sin

In the curse after midnight
When inferno born and the mask unveiled
Be the last man unbroken
And in light the one to fade

Nighttime rebel, all we ride against the dark
Nighttime rebel, bear a holy heart
Nighttime rebel, summon in the dawn and let begin
Nighttime rebel, pray and fight against the world
Nighttime rebel, make the call be heard
Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and bring the sin
Nighttime rebel
