Fire and forgive
We all
Fire and forgive
We call
Fire and forgive

Sons of god and sacrament
The night we're dying for
By the call of pyromania
Bring fire into war

Rest in flame by testament
At midnight we return
Raise inferno for the living
The grail of life we burn

Rex patrum
In cielis
Peccata mundi delis
Rex patrum
Ignis imperia

And we bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
Forgiven the liar, by fire we live
We bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
The last of our blood we will give

Fundamental armament
The price we all ignore
Bring to fall the last of saviour
To son of god we swore

Once ignited, out of hand
The beast we all can't tame
By the wildest of the holy law
Come praise the lord in flame

Rex patrum
In cielis
Peccata mundi delis
Rex patrum
Ignis imperia

And we bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
Forgiven the liar, by fire we live
We bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
The last of our blood we will give

Fire, fire, fire and forgive
Fire, fire, fire and forgive

Fire and forgive
We all
Fire and forgive
We call
Fire and forgive

And we bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
Forgiven the liar, by fire we live
We bring fire, sing fire
Scream fire and forgive
The last of our blood we will give
