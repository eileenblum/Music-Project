This is the Black Mass Hysteria
This is the Black Mass
I'm crawling you, into your veins
Loving my soul
And so you weigh my problem down

I see you alive until you're stuck
The ... of my throne
And then you say that love was found

Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria

I'm coming out and see your veins
I'm proud of myself
But let it down and see your weight

I'm feeling out, the time has come
The devil in my soul
We are livin' in this town
Weigh down on you

And you're feeling out my'if you know
I'm coming now
I tell you to feel my soul

Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria

See it's just a black
See it's just a black mass
See it's just a Black Mass Hysteria

Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
Black Mass Hysteria
