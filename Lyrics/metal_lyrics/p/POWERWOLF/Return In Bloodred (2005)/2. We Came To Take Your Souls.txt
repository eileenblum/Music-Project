You know when I live on a Saturday night
We came to take your souls
My heart is broken and I leave you to fight
We came to take your souls
I see in a law and I come out to fight
We came to take your souls

You know when I live on a Saturday night
We came to take your souls
My heart is broken and I leave you to fight
We came to take your souls
I see in a law and I come out to fight
We came to take your souls

And you will live on [?]
The time you will [?]
We wanna live long and [?]
You take my soul and I'm feeling each other
[?]

Down on the knees and I come out to take
We came to take your souls
I wanna live and I'm feeling this way
We came to take your souls
We come on a [?] I don't feel it tonight
We came to take your souls

And you will live on
The time you will [?]
We wanna live long and [?]
You take my soul and I'm feeling it each other
[?]
