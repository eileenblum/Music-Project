The evil made me do it all
The evil made me do it
The evil made me do it
The evil made me do it all

Come real closer
Fire fighters in the moon
And when you live like I do
The time is coming out

The evil made me do it
The evil made me go
The evil made me do it all

When the loners are
It's time to break for you to run
And when I see you stuck and bright
And when I feel you out of my sight

The evil made me do it
The evil made me go
The evil made me do it all

The evil made me do it
The evil made me go
The evil made me do it all
