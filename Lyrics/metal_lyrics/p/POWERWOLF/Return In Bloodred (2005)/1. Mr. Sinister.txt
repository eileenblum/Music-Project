You got your hands to raise your fist
See the laughter from its rise
Can you resist me little sister
Can you resist the devil's might

And whatever god may tell you
Every soul will have it's price
One day you'll come to sell me yours my dear
And the time has come to life

Mr. Sinister, Mr. Sinister, Mr. Sinister
Alright

Come hear the whisper for the sinner
Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Free from [?] love in heaven
In the end you'll pay the cost

And wherever you will run to
And wherever you may hide
There will be no escape, my friend
From the evil by your side

Mr. Sinister, Mr. Sinister, Mr. Sinister

It can't be over
You tell me say, you what I know"
The time is over
And now you're waiting [?]
Come hear the whisper Mr. Sinister, Mr. Sinister

Mr. Sinister, Mr. Sinister, Mr. Sinister
Alright
