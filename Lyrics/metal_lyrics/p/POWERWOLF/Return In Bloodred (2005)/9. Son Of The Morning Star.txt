Come to me
Into my arms and see
There is no claw to fear
Lucifer is near

Walk with me
Into the light and see
No way will be to far
Son of the morning star

Oh no I cant believe
I see the lord is born
Oh god the lord is born

Come to me
Into my arms and see
There is no claw to fear
Lucifer is near

Walk with me
Into the light and see
No way will be to far
Son of the morning star

Oh no I cant believe
I see the lord is born
Oh god the lord is born


Thanks to jeanlamim for sending track #9 lyrics.
