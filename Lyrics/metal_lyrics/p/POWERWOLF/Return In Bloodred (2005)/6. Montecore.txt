My baby don't cry
My baby don't fear
Should I have you know

Come follow me into the light
And you will se the fire's eyes
Come follow me into the night
And you will see the spider's eyes
Come follow me into the war
And you can feel the power of montecore

Montecoore, the tiger of doom!

Come follow me into the light
And you will see the afterlife
Come follow me into the night
And you will see tiger's eyes
Come follow me into the war
And you can feel the power of montecore

Montecore, the tiger of doom!

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Montecore, the tiger of doom! [4x]
