Light
I'll never see the light
I'll never see you never hate you down tonight

Oh light
I'll never see the light
I'll never feel you never hate you down tonight

Oh light
I'll never see the light
I'll never feel you never hate

Night
I'll never see the night
When you see me in the darkness down tonight

Oh night
I'll never see the night
For the demons and the diamonds I will fight

Oh night
I'll never see the night
I'll never feel never hate

Demons and diamonds
Demons and diamonds
Demons and diamonds
Demons and diamonds

Demons and diamonds
Demons and diamonds
Demons and diamonds
Demons and diamonds
