In the metal of fight
When we always stand together
In the metal of fight
And the victory is near

In the metal of fight
When we always come together
In the metal of fight
And were always were you fall

Lucifer
Lucifer in starlight

In the metal of fight
When I see thereâs no tomorrow
In the metal of fight
When my heart is open wide

In the metal of fight
In the victory tomorrow
In the metal of fight
When I see this hungry were

Lucifer
Lucifer in starlight

Lucifer
Lucifer in starlight

Lucifer
Lucifer in starlight
