The night dies in the morning
And hell is gone at dawn
He sent no bible warning
Forsaken and forlorn

The night was wild
Black magic has its price
Remember me?
You'll meet the devil twice!

In the morning when I wake
No more souls are left to take
And I wonder why I'm here

The sun is up, it's almost nine
And I'm standing in a sign
I feel a slowly rising fear

In a circle did I sleep?
Had I blasphemies to keep?
The scent of sulphur in the air

Hail, hail pentagram
Hail, hail pentagram
God damnit
What have I done?

Panic... panic in the pentagram
Panic... Satanism ain't no fun
Oh... panic in the pentagram
Oh... panic in the pentagram

I count my cash, it's six six six
Enough to cross the river Styx
I pay to Cerberos the fare

On the altar I could dance
Put your soul in deadly trance
But I better should beware

Hail, hail pentagram
Hail, hail pentagram
God damnit
What have I done?

Panic... panic in the pentagram
Panic... Satanism ain't no fun
Oh... panic in the pentagram
Oh... panic in the pentagram
