Seven
Seven deadly saints
Oh, seven
Seven deadly saints can fight for us

When the devil comes for your soul
And the evil will take control
And when Lord Satan is on your mind
And the demons
Call from behind

No revelation
The darkest night
Incarnation
Crucified at midnight

Congregation
To provocate
Immolation
It's not too late 'cause

Stay, I pray
Help me I'm a slave in Satan's order
Stay, I pray
Call the ancient prophecy
Come to me

Seven
Seven deadly saints
Oh, seven
Seven deadly saints can fight for us

When no prayer can ease your pain
And the sermon is all insane
And when your heaven and hope is gone
They will hunt you
For what you've done to us

Inside the darkness they will wait for you
Seven demons incarnate it's true

Master help me I'm a slave in Satan's order
Break free, call the age of prophecy
Come to me

Seven
Seven deadly saints
Oh, seven
Seven deadly saints can fight for us
