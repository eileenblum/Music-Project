Pestilence, silence, torture and death
When you wake up from your lies
Born into fire, black is thy breath
Your empire

Sacrilege, fire, murder and rape
Nightmare and torment arise
Burn on the pyre, find no escape
Now the time my dominator
All we need today
For hell we pray

St. Satan, St. Satan
When will you come, to welcome your son
St. Satan, St. Satan
Rise for the call
Wait for the bible to fall
Today we celebrate

Lucifer, tempter, lord of the flies
Dark is the blade of your knife
Wait for damnation, downfall of Christ
Roaring lion

Mater of temptation, take them to hell
Demons in darkness unite
Abbadon, serpent, black is your spell
Can't resist you, oh Mephisto, come and take my hand
For your command

St. Satan, St. Satan
When will you come, to welcome your son
St. Satan, St. Satan
Rise for the call
Wait for the bible to fall
Today we celebrate

Sinister, violence, warfare and hate - demons that come for your life
Storming the altar, open the gate
Kill the virgin
Burn in hellfire, now it's too late
Agony after you died

Baphomet, liar, breaker of fate
Fall of brave men
Master Satan
Come and take my hand

St. Satan, St. Satan
St. Satan's day
