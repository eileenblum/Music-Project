[Music and lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

'Rape, murder, suicide..
These thoughts are constantly with me
Of course, this is not mentally 'healthy'
There is no doubt that by present standards
I am mentally ill, a hopeless sociopath

My reason tells me
That I have nothing to live for

Intellectually, sexually..
Occupationally, socially..

Everywhere a dead end
The pain now outweighs the pleasure
And every day adds weight
To the logic of self-destruction..'
