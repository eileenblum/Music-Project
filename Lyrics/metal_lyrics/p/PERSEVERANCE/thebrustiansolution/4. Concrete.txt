[Music by Rhys Mathew, lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

'When you first kill someone, it's like breaking the ice
It's an obstacle in the beginning, but after that..
.. it's nothing.'

People are like maggots
Small, blind and worthless

Mary Ellen Jones, of immaculate skin and fragile bones
Unbroken, tight and clean (and shy of sixteen..)
Note well the year is nineteen seventy-three
And in summate, this righteous fortune, 'Vidi, Vici, Veni..'

Whilst Dahmer court' depravity
Manson's brood and Gacy's violent sexuality
Mine is calm necessity, for needs unmet and social anxieties
Balanced blood, and nature coursed toward it

Though not as easily bound
Nor hidden from the waking sight
Of post-ejaculate catharsis
The gravity of my actions has finally sought me

The trance-like state of passion
Now forever broken, and the flood of realization
for transgressions at the night before
Rushed to my senses
With the weight of a concrete hammer
Shattering completely the chrysalis around me

Within the chamber
A whimpering child, tied
And with dark mascara smeared across her porcelain features
Faith pulverized by the night's atrocities
Begged an end to my advance

And without
A prostrate boy, denied the dawn
And soaked cold through with hues of blood and rage
Day's light forever now beyond sensation
Sought paradise foregone, away

An emptiness far greater than any felt before, arrived
And defined a catalyst for this panorama of destruction
Draining all joy from those things I had done

.. at this, the veil was lifted
And euphoria gave ground completely to evocation
Mary cried maternal..
As salvation lay farther than ever from my grasp
