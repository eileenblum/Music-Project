[Music and lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

Mediocrity's face, no greater the torment
Spared potent duresses and obvious malady
From childhood's lament, through youth's awkward epiphanies
Time ushered apartheid, wisdom bought clarity

For years, nigh on decades, that threshold advanced
Persecuted by virtues reserved for the blessed
As this rage welled within me though, visions grew clearer
Manifesting a project for him that reflected the mirror

The weight of the world and this vile exterior
Forgiven no trespass, resigned and inferior
'Always and never', mine mantra rehearsed
But no longer and never again will this face follow curse

In dream I wander restlessly
A landscape painted fantasy
As paragon and victory
In wildernesses draped eternal dusk

Amiss, that instant whence I lapsed from daydream
And chanced to test the waters of temptation
However, now forever changed, I stagger
Onward towards forbidden pleasures nearer

Designed a tale in detail crafted horror
From whence I might forever sate this hunger
To take and break the will as bread communion
And bind this sacrament in sexual union

Onward, through the endless grey
Trespassing, thus, forbidden ley
Desire's fire, and carnal swey
In wildernesses draped eternal dusk

Simplicity's intricacies, beyond my reach; reality
Conformity, complacency, base urge will out, eventually..
Sadistically, methodically, in finest sculpted fantasy
The chamber awaits and hour draws late, lest will abate..

.. a swansong on the 'morn
