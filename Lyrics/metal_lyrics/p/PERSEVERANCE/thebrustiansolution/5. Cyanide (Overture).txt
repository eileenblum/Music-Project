[Music by Rhys Mathew and Gareth Sansom]

'I have miscalculated
I know I can save the situation
By a lot of disagreeable work
But I see no good reason for going on
What would come next..?
The whole business is not worth it

Life is not worth the trouble, after all'

Gareth Jack Sansom: vocals and lyrics, keyboard, drums and guitars
Rhys Mathew: electric and acoustic guitars
Patrick Horgan: bass guitars
Phil Djukic: lead guitars
