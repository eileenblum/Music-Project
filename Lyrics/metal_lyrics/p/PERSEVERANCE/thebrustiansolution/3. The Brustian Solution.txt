[Music and lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

Stark naked, cold, and in inglorious entire
As an open wound upon the concept flesh of humanity
I now submit my will to body
Forgivenesses as far beyond my grasp
As were near the ironic values of those delusions
Which once claimed day's hours, and fought the warmth from starless nights
Ever more often now to prevail
A warmth that would otherwise attest salvation as still within my reach

Amidst literatures, which once too offered solace
From an otherwise cruel and oft surreal affliction
Tomes now cold to the touch, and which yield naught
Save for distant, confusing familiarities
Which belong only to a simpler man, and thats image persists
As much so as the sickly scent of that cosmetic bouquet
From which every fairer manifest sex I would pass about my musings
And upon my journey into murderous disposition lingers
I sit and give power to this epiphany;

All interpretation is nothing but masturbation
As many words would colour as countless truths would tear asunder
Every monument a satire for reckless self-deception
This world and Earth and all, a curse in shades of colourlessness left behind

So then, I here succumb to lusts attraction
And undertake to task those plans in motion
That I decide by force for satisfaction
And swear to close this monster's evolution

Affections, few and dilute as they lingered
Not ever I these truths will have rescinded
No virtue holds against this dark ablution
Anon arrives the 'Brustian Solution'

Aye, there is a dawning knowledge, after all
And a savior defined in this uncomfortable discovery;
'Self is commandment, without the clay
And all sensation as sacred as that moment in which it is taken'
No document could hope to attain those lofty heights
To which this rebel's ego might still soar
If nothing more is learnt than this; I now clearly see
That the answer which for so long proved elusive
Was only so for fear of castigation

Was I for so long the incarnation of abstention..

So then, I here succumb to lusts attraction
And undertake to task those plans in motion
That I decide by force for satisfaction
And swear to close this monster's evolution

Affections, few and dilute as they lingered
Not ever I these truths will have rescinded
No virtue held against this dark ablution
With dawn arrives the 'Brustian Solution'
