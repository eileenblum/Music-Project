Lines of streetlights blindAnd illuminate the rainBlood washes with the waterAs it trickles from my veinsThis broken bottle begs anotherCigarettes and broken glassI want this night to cross the lineFor this to be my last The fear of destitutionIs destroying my lifeThis spiralling depressionIs tearing me apart Screams into the darknessBloodied hands outstretched in vainBegging for the night to take meJust to fade into the rainA shadow and a memoryA reflection of a dreamAny reason to stop livingAny way to end this pain This hopeless desolationThis emptiness withinI cannot see through darknessI have to make this end
