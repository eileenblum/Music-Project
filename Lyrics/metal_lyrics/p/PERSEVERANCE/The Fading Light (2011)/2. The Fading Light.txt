When each waking momentBegins to feel as though it has already beenAn emotionless repeatOf a failure enduredWhen icicles spread throughoutAnd skin begins to markThe illusion of buoyancy shattersNothing is perfect, beauty a mythDriven like nails through boneA fantasy to veil the truths of this worldTruths which reek of piss and shitAnd the broken bodies of menThe smell is fucking unbearableCold is the blood which flows from meAs cold as the razor I bearGive me the strength to leaveI don't want to live anymore
