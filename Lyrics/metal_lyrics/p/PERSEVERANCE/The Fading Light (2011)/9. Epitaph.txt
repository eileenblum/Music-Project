Recollection of past affectionsFading gradually into obscurity and confusionLeaving only awareness of a dismal presentAnd a hopeless futureIt's dark all the time nowAnd the emptiness within me has become unbearableI can't stand this pain any longerNor the crushing headaches and nauseaI have no sentiment for a worthless worldAnd a meaningless lifeNo trust in faith or salvationOnly a deep bitterness and frustration Above all storms and tormentsDarkness sets beautifullyAcross an endless skyAs the last of light fades away
