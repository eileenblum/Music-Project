Blackouts and depressionEach hangover is longer than the lastI pray to death's releaseThat the next time will be for goodA night without morningA dusk without a dawnSlowly it all falls awayDespite perseveranceDisappointment after bitter failureEventually even stone will crackWith each mouthful of spiritsI hope to kill more of myselfWith each fistful of pillsI hope to dull more of this lifeWith every cut across my fleshI hope I will bleed to deathThere is nothing in this world for meSave a slow spiral towards oblivionHere's to loneliness, failure and miseryThanks for nothing
