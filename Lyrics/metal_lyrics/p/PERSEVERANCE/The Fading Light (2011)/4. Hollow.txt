So it comes to thisSuch promise through eyes of youthA child's blinkered viewThe world that could have beenI've struggled with the truthDenied the filth I've seenA hope for a better tomorrowFor fruit amongst the thornThis life  has long since rottedAll happiness stillbornNo solace 'midst a spreading mistOf helplessness and scornThere waits a new horizonA calm surpassing stormAn emptiness so beautifulA nothingness so sublimeThis Godless void internalEchoes from a soulless cryThe pain of life is killing meJust let me fucking die
