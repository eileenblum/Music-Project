Where is the light in an abyss?Where is the comfort in death?Give me salvation, give me anythingGive me a reason to draw breath The truth of this world is failureThe worth of persistence, despairEverything's cold and so distantPlease take me away from here.. Cover my eyes, bury my fearsSilence my voice, soften this agonyThis emptiness feels like a voidSo cold and alone and so hollow inside My days have turned to melancholyMy soul crippled, lifeless wreckI can no longer feel the world around mePlease lay me down and let me rest
