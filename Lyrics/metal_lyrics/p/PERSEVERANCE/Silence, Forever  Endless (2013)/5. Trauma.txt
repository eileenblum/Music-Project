[Music by Rhys Mathew, Lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

[Tall Man (Act II):]
Through years of lucid trauma
Through tears and sleepless nights have I screamed
Bid terrors, leave this savant!
Get out mine ears, away my sight!

With every waking hour
She calls to me with wanton grace
How can I stay this horror
And the truth of my affliction mirrored in her face?

[Narrator:]
In darkest witching hour
His twisted form closed distance
As he crept towards her dorm
They watched, disfigured, shadows flickered
Darkness clothed the moon
Choked silent and left breathless of splendour
As he descended at her bedside..

Awakened by a whisper rose above the storm without
Two fisted, she resisted as he clasped one hand across her tiny mouth

As fell the pall in silence
So too the fragile veil
In the courtyard outside
A murder of ravens, relieving themselves of sight
Chose their remaining days in darkness
As if the shame would never leave them
