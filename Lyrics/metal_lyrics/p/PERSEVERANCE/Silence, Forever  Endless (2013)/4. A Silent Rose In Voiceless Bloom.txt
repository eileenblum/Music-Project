[Music by Rhys Mathew, Lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

[Doctor:]
Naomi, a child of God's good grace
A testament to patient faith
This fragile orphan life exposed
To patricide and violent overthrow

Such is the modern world's incline
That beauty and adversity are fated meet

We are committed and we are bound
By both virtue and oath
Sworn to pursue a hope, elusive:
Closure for a troubled soul
And peace where only sadness has been known

[Narrator:]
As season wax and yearly wane
So time was passed, our child she grew
From timid youth, through timid years
A silent rose in voiceless bloom

No utterance, no word she spoke
In spite of the gentlest confidence
And when descended winter's snow
Upon her thirteenth year
So August's ghost
Shed softly sheets of frost
Turning tragically aside her vigilance

Let it never be said
That those darkest shades of horror rest
Merely they wait with a tireless composure
For an unchecked window
Through which to visit their wicked wills
Upon the pure

One shadow such, a ghoul, a tempest fierce
With a hateful mind and hollow soul
Oppressed behind eyes of the coldest malevolence
Would stalk the halls of Beechworth with impunity
Twisted through choice; he rots from within
Appearing to the waking world naught
Save a shell to be fleshed
And a beast to be unleashed

So restraint will fail it seems
In the presence of opportunity

And never the twain shall meet
Never the twain shall meet..
