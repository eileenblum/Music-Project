[Part I: Mayday Hills]

[Music and Lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

[Narrator:]
..and so this opus scorned attracts cognition
The cast of faceless patrons
Whose stories as yet remain untold
Manifest
Curtains decrepit, set, stage and scene attended
Demure as starlight stalks
Through cracks in an ageless vanity
Enter disposition!
