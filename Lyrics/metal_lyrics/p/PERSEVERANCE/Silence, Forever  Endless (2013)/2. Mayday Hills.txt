[Music by Rhys Mathew, Lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

[Presenter:]
Bid welcome all, my treasured guests
To that which I present
Six chapters through, two volumes deep
Upon which to obsess
Six tales of darkness, rage and fear
Six horrors of the mind
An unforgiving madness awaits
Ambivalence, the trusting and the blind

Allow me to introduce a collection of borrowed souls
And the stray arcane
From darkest past and yet to pass
Both villain and protagonist are one and the same
Bid venture, join this company
Descend on chaos fair
Through entry pass into descent
And into darkest flair

Our scene arrives at a time and place
Undisclosed, undefined
Amid winter's full-moon tapestry
'Cross moor and mist alike

Through halls enshrined in history
Walls burdened with wicked tales
In which abuse, torment and dark secrets meet
Softly to share their tears
In shadowed corners
Meet fair Naomi
Skin as pale as the purest moonlight
Filtered softly through curtains of fine lace
Hair the colour of darkest Ebony
Eyes the depth of human suffering
Reflecting all..
