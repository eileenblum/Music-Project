[Music and Lyrics by Gareth Sansom]

[Naomi (Act I):]
As ashes gently lain to rest
Upon a quiet soil
Unmoved by winds of turbulence
Unbroken by the fall
Such captivating beauty lies
In that which holds its truth
The unadulterated preservation of its youth

Where angels fell from skies above
From heights of gilded grace
Towards an Earth of faded hopes
And self-inflicted fates
While blows a gale of discontent
Here breathes a sigh of hope
For that which holds its love of life
In the face of such affliction
Thrives alone

I am the final Adeline
The last of a lineage
A child of loss and tragedy
Orphaned through an horrific misfortune
And witness to horrors and deeds transpired
The likes of which would turn the boldest stride
And bleed black the stronger heart

Through corridors of madness
Virgin soil strewn with the fractured shards
Of a fragile youth's shattered mind
I have wandered lost for such a time
As for all hope to others fade
My body bound to Mayday Hills
Where treatment, ill and symptom collide
Distinction often compromised
In a desperate, dire gnosis
(To which you shall bear witness)
