To be your selfgod you need to surrender
To your own will
Question all your convictions and fears
Reborn in yourself

The birth of faith
Is the fear that the mortals
Have for what their minds don't know
Nobody wants salvation
They just runaway from an ironic love

That condemn their children
To a prison of pain
And gnashing of teeth
Subduing them to a short miserable life
Under what they try to call love

To be your selfgod you need to surrender
To your own will
Spit out your convictions and fears
Reborn in yourself

Dear father, today I am leaving you
And in a scream of freedom that echoes in the emptiness I can say:
My will be done!

The birth of faith
Is the fear that the mortals
Have for what their minds don't know
Nobody wants salvation
They just runaway from an ironic love

That condemn their children
To a prison of pain
And gnashing of teeth
Subduing them to a short miserable life
Under what they try to call love

The church put away the guns and the lions
Exchanged for lies and promises
The witch of the new era
