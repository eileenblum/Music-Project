They ripped out your eyes, promising you love
Painted all the walls with the word: Faith
They made you sick, to sell you the cure
Fear the eternity
Fuck the salvation!

Where's your faith?
You know just what they want
Saying it's your turn to scribble
Those words of pain

But they killed you somehow, I can see
What you call faith, take a piece if you want
It's different for me: I call disgrace

They're taking my blood, they're taking my flesh
My faith is gone, I've nothing left

Sucked all you had, promising you peace
Spotted all the white screen with fake blood
Invited me to enjoy the holy bread
But it was my own fucking flesh

They're taking my blood, they're taking my flesh
My faith is gone, I've nothing left
They're taking my blood, they're taking my flesh
My faith is gone, I've nothing left

Where's your faith?

Those words of pain
