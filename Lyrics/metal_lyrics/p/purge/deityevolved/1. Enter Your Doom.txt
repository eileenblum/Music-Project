Cackling!

Standing
On your remains
Licking the blood
Staining my hands
Barons and knights
I take an oath:
None will survive
For you brought this war upon
Me and my kind!

To tear and to rip
To kill and to maim
Until it is done
Knee-deep in the dead
You think you know pain,
You've not seen your fate
You think you know hell,
Trust me when I say:
You may bring your weapons
I'll only bring your doom

Bring your doom!
