No one survives (destruction)
Creatures and makers (corruption)
Failed perfection

No one survives (destruction)
Creatures and makers (corruption)
Failed perfection

Abomination evolved
Surviving in eternal
Conflict (it brought upon itself)
Bred like cattle
Living in fear of hell
Hell is here and now!

They can pray to their gods
There will be no answer
They will be the first to fall

No one survives
Creatures and makers
Failed perfection!

Is a man corrupted by himself?
Or does he follow steps left by the creator?
Is a man corrupted by himself?
For every single inch of his was molded after god

The future is your non-existence
The new gospel will rule this earth
Free from all the disgraceful filth
Inherent to the human

Brains, eyes, tongue, heart
Lungs, kidneys, liver, bowels
Skin, muscle, nerve, bone
Blood, semen, womb of:

Lying, cheating, stealing, greedy
Judging, killing, raping, ignorant
Selfish, hollow, shallow, jealous
Sons of god!

No one survives!
