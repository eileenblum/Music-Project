Hope and glory!

I can't be a blind witness
While they play with our laws
Believe me until you see it
The nation will cry and fall in disgrace

Fucking cowards, they don't see
Thieves wearing suits, motherfuckers using the throne
Until when? They can't see
Pigs wearing suits, motherfuckers ruining our lives

Don't fuck with my country!

Don't fuck with my country!

You don't belong in here, you are not welcome
Lead them all with your speech
Get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me

The country is in chaos (and the media hides)
But I can see... I can see it
There's blood on the streets (and the media hides)
But they will see... They will see you!

Filha da puta!

I've watched you laugh in your brand ties
I've seen you bathe in your blood money
You've built your putrid empire
Starving others for your glory

Hang yourself in your brand ties
Drown yourself in your blood money
Take the easy way out, lose your hope
Your punishment is coming!

Don't fuck with my country!

Don't fuck with my country!

You don't belong in here, you are not welcome
Lead them all with your speech
Get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me

Lose your hope and glory!
