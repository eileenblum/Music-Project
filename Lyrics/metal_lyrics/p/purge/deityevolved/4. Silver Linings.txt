How can I lose my way to you?
And dive into this sea of disgrace
Am I to lose the eyes and ears?
To be reborn

No!
Spare me from your brain poisoning
I don't see the point of bearing
Witness to your crime

Smell the putrefaction
Structures crumbling down
Amidst the proliferation
If it was up to me I'd burn it down

Fire!

Witness the deconstruction
Of individual thought formation
I don't see the point of twisting
Wind into belief

Drown with me
In human consciousness

When will you realize that
I lack your faith
To swallow the filth you dwell in

Embrace the hate!
My closest friend

Deny the sun!
Brightness turns your wary eyes blind
Don't try to redefine justice
Concepts break before they bend

Don't try to show me the silver linings
Please allow me to express the acrimony
Brewing from within these tired aging bones
Twisting hopes and dreams alike into the bitterness of death

Deny the sun!
Brightness leaves your wary eyes blind
Decline the truth!
Look away from the steel eating at your flesh

Judgement finds us all

Descend with me

Red skies turning black
