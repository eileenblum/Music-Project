Storm-brought-at most spheres-
Only an answer to find
Head in hands
And Eyes so high
No God above (No Fate)
Storm. Brought. At most fearsâ¦
Life. Search. Incomplete.
Who am I Who am I Who am I?

Me above all MY
Bridge from the sound until the silence left behind
Free again!
Be a wolf and a child and a root
Keep denying your rules
Real beliefs arenât proved
So deny
There canât be walls
When thereâs no ground
Life stands in I
Death starts with Things
Rule?
Just deny it.

Me above all My
Me above this Everything that cannot be my pride
Me above all My own
Iâll recognize myself when Iâm able to hear my birth
This means that I will find my All
This means that I will find my All
