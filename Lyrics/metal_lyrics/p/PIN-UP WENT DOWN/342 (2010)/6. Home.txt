Home
I disappeared
my room
My souvenirs
Cold
And blur inside (the free world)
You know how hard I tried
All that time I realized
I was alone without Her mind
And I was not beautiful with that No-Child
Home
I disappeared
because
The Â« A Â» -I was lost-
Rains on your windows
Sometimes I deeply know Iâve to free my own
Self

I only feed a world at your feet
But I ainât a sun lying between
A closed door and the ground
A closed door and the ground
