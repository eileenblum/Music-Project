Didnât need no heavenly powerâ¦
Didnât need no heavenly guide!
My Daddy is mould with terror.
Fucking Hatred Style!

Â« Alone alone in his world,
Daddy Daddy lonely is he Â»

Shades on Daddy Daddyâ¦
Daddy says BURIALYET
Wake up daily daily with that fear on our head
Shades on Daddy Daddyâ¦
Daddy says BURIAL YET
Free me from our void

Kabhod of my aba

Weâre all looking for a way to survive
Weâre all trying to fly away from our past
And I do the same
I do the same.
Weâre all looking for errors to ignite
Weâre all the child of a father
Weâre all the child of a child of a father.
Sometimes help meâ¦ sometimes Iâm scared.

Look away as I look you daggers
over and
Hoover and
over and
hoover
once more.
Such a strange way my Dad
To free yourself from your ownâ¦
Forgive yourself for not being God.
