When you were born Chiara
My burial veil returned to the dead
I woke up one morning
And snails were dancing in my brain
I opened my eyes on earth
And my heart left a room where I used to wander
Sleeping like a question in the guts of a ghost
When you were born Chiara
My void became a stair and they were up
Iâm still a wound in time
But snails are dancing in my brain
I open my arms today and
You are running all around my days and Iâm
Covering yours like a mother Iâm not
