Every piece of
this cold truth
knowing all
from shit to shit
knowing nothing at all
fear of the lies
fear of the lights

The truth
Around
Iâd rather be blind
Iâd rather seize that porcelain hours
But I know
Fear of the light as youâre seeking deep
Fear of the ground as youâre losing it
Wake up wake up
what you seek indeed
Every piece of a cold truth is a grave to remind
Every piece of this cold truth
Knowing all from shit to shit
Iâd rather be blind
Never know nothing at all
Fear of the light as youâre seeking deep
Fear of the ground as youâre losing it
Wake up wake up what you seek indeed
What you seek is a grave to remind.
