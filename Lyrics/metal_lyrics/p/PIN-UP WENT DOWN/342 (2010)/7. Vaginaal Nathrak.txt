hey hey
Thatâs whatâs they say : youâll have to prove who you are
And I know
The secret of the greatest stars
Letâs go! Mais câest pas possible!
But now Iâm ready for my show
Iâm ready to be your great Mistress
And worldwide guys if you donât let me go
Iâll make you taste the flavour of my whole inside!
Â« But youâre thirteen years oldâ¦ girl?! Â»
What you seek
What you do
What you look for
Is not what I am nor what I want them to see
Seek your freedom in the haze of Cyprine Army!
Und Colonel! Du bist keine kÃ¶nigin and youâre losing the ring of respect!
Canât imagine a world without my *** (your tadada)
Not a hole to every key
Not the answer toâ¦ ohâ¦ everybody

Just like a snake in time for the rest of all her lifeâ¦
How Iâm afraid it will never stop hophophop!
She melts her tits with pride to make the Â« coo coo Â» alive
And iâm afraid it wonât stop hophop-nope!
I wish a snake in my *** and iâm reigning on my life!
Why are you afraid?
(Afraidâ¦)
Thatâs the wrong word! I wish I could stand up!
Imagine my world without my *** â¦

I pray for the reign of my tits on the world
