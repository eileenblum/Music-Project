Here
Lina and her guy
Sophia and her child
A table, a house, my kitchenâ¦
Here
My hand on my breast
My eyes asking why theyâre still so so far
And people feet
Clac clac Clac
On the floor
And people here far in my head
Already dead.

Shall I choose how this one should
Be petrified at his age
Perfect age to perfect hour
Going higher would be wrong to stop
For your immortality
I must embrace and crucify all the beauty
In my head

Gone

Theyâre all gone

Thereâs a smell of death all around
