What side will it be?
Oh what oh what side will it be?
The buttered side if bread agrees
Oh what oh what side will it be?
Brain upside down the law on knees
And marmalade on my Leviâsâ¦
Oh what a pretty awaited happy day of shit !

Hello every happy bird
Iâm starting my day
And I realize
I realize
Câest dâjÃ  la merde
Et comme il faut!
Iâm sick of the winks
Of the Evil Eye; hope he will
Et comme il faut!

Here is the law of lonely days!
And you try to understand but thereâs something more to seeâ¦

Glad to live this fucking stuff
Shit! My socks are already wet
Damned! Tell meâ¦
What? Everythingâs ok! (Just wait for more!)
Shit! My keys in da drain hole and a hole where it tanglesâ¦.
Pire!
Tell me what? Everythingâs ok! (That could be worstâ¦)

And then it rains and you feel
And then it fails and you feel like fate has disobeyed
And then you think that youâre born
Under a star full of scorn and it was not your day
And now you fail and you feel
And now it rains and you feel like youâre in the wrong way
Beware of the law! Beware of the law!
Câest la loi des sÃ©ries!
Damned! My wife wetter than my socksâ¦ In my bed with my friend!
Pire! Tell meâ¦what? Everythingâs ok! (Could have been your dad!)

Though you donât believe youâre a chosen one
You feel like you were followed by a never ending April Foolâs day

A slice of bread choosing to fallâ¦ the buttered side against the floor
And the story is knownâ¦ (Let the saw sings right now..!)

What side will it be on this pretty day of shit?
Wrong side for wrong mind with this acrid taste of curse above your head
As an uncertain list of endsâ¦Cheer up! There will be only one.
