Youâre the bad bad boy Youâre the shitty liar
Youâre the bad bad girl Youâre the nasty one
But the bad bad ones have no great great wall to hide behind in silence
Cause the floor knows how to speak.
Deedadeedadee Oh!
You make your worst show
But youâre as foreseeable as the melt of the snow
Dadeedadeeda Ouh! Ouh!
Youâll have to pay your dueâ¦
But in this Sarabanda what youâve lost isâ¦
YOU.
Heyâ¦
Estravanganza lied and betrayed
E Caccia Caccia Time without a prey
E la maschera that falls
And no answerâ¦ non câÃ¨

Deedadeedadee Oh!
You make your worst show
But youâre as foreseeable as the melt of the snow
Dadeedadeeda Ouh! Ouh!
Youâll have to pay your dueâ¦
But in this Sarabanda what youâve lost isâ¦
YOU.

Show us again what you were and not what you areâ¦
Every time I hear you saying youâre right
And I know what you are is not what you say at all.

Here I shall fall
