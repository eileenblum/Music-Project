See them hide under my bed
Hear them laugh and speak and plot!
I donât want to disappoint them,
I donât want to grief their joke, they seem so busyâ¦
Little monsters under my bed
But my bed is so empty
You know
I should keep on hiding the truth
I should keep on letting them play

Heeey! See them hide here under my bed!
I donât want to disappoint them
They are so wicked numb!

Little monsters under my bed
But me bed is so empty
You have to know
I died so many years ago.
