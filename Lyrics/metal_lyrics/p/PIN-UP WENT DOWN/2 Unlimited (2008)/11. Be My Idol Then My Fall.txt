She could have wanted to puke her guts out
To hate you, deny you, to blame you
To blame you for all
Remember! (the Piggieâs)
Remember (still rising)
Remember that you made her fall
She will forget nothing, but you make her grow
You made her crawl down and sheâs sick of it all! 
Sick! Sick! Sick! Sick of it all!

No, no choice to have,
Be my idol, then my fall

Here I am
And I rise, and I spit and I donât even care
There you were
And you roots are my leaves
And your hell has been mine
Sorry, but I just won

(Not a Â«fuck youÂ», just a Â«thank youÂ», I am still alive/ I still clap clap clap )

Blame you for all?
Why? Why? Why? â¦. âYouâre nothing!â

Owanapipiouanahahahaouh, owanapipiouana haha 

A twist in my convictionâ¦
Blame me if you dare. 
A twist in my conviction
âNo you canât goâ¦
No you canât go onâ
