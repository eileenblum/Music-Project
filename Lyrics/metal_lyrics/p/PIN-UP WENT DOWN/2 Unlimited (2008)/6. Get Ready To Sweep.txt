"What you lived, what you felt is worse than treason
I have wasted what you gave and you've lost your faith
What I've done has no sense, though it fed the pain
But my pain, in a way, was nearly the same"

Judging facts is just a silly thing when you don't know why they've been committed, so get ready to sweep

Do you really think it's time to blame an enemy that 's born from your own vision of life
From wonderful rules you may betray?
Don't you really think you could be what you denounce? 
Indeed, our laws can choose the other side, and who would be right?

I slept, you see, now I know, 
Truth is never the same
Seeds you fed were scornful 
And your lies
And my lies
Are nothing but a jail to survive.

-And the world will be clean... â

"Let everyone sweep in front of his own door and the whole world will be clean." 
-and clean the world you live in- 
Instead of choosing if you want to forgive, cross your own doors and get ready to sweep.

Scorn, Sick-
-ness In what you say
âNow, angels, go to hellâ
But did you see
How lost we were?
And will you never
Forgive this slaugh-
-ter we just made?
Coz we were
Lonely Flesh.

All the actions youâd like to explain canât always be what they seem
You know, weâre made of questions without answers
Flesh without reason
With/without
Will you be kind enough to listen to what I have to say
Right now
Donât try to create another truth
This one you see should have been
Yours
