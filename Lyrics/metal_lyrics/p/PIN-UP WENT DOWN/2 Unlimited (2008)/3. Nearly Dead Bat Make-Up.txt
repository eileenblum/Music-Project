Be obscene, be, be aggressive.
Be obscene, be, be aggressive.
Be obscene, be, be aggressive.
Be obscene, be, be aggressive.

It's time to figure out
You have been too numb
Probably blinded by a so called morality
Oh Jesus, who are these men
With their nearly dead bat make-up?
We won't try
We don't want to try to understand!

Tonight we belong to me (you goddamn fuckers!)
Wouldn't you like to know me (goddamn fuckers!)
Love Gun and Love Theme For Kiss (goddamn fuckers!)
Holy frigid society! (goddamn fuckers!)

For the rights you wait!
For the laws you break!
Be obscene, be, be aggressive.

For the rights you wait!
For the laws you break!
Be obscene, be, be aggressive.

For the rights we wait?
For the laws we break?
Nevermind!

Tonight we belong to me and other stuff like that
No extermination needs nor other hailing hand
Beware all the different meanings you can understand
When the bat is more than grey, even their mind just play dead

For the rights you wait?
For the laws you break?
Be obscene, be, be aggressive.

For the rights you wait?
For the laws you break?
Be obscene, be, be aggressive.

It's time to see what's behind
A burning cross and a blast beat,
Not again, not a-motherfucking-gain
None other than Gene Simmons
Who sings love better than anyone else.

It's time to see what's behind
A burning cross and a blast beat,
Not again, not a-motherfucking-gain
None other than Gene Simmons
Who sings love better than anyone!

For the laws you breakâ¦ just nevermind!
For the laws you breakâ¦ just nevermind!
For the laws you breakâ¦ just nevermind!
For the laws you breakâ¦ just nevermind!

For the rights we wait?
For the laws we break?
Nevermind!

Beware all the different meanings you can understand through that
