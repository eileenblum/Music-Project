Solia was like this, and you should agree with me
She was a yoyo maid
Sometimes âyeahyeah!â sometimes âshit!â
Haha 
Her mind like a trash bin in the middle of a wonderland
Strawberry shortcake haunted by a million voices
Saying youâre the dirty one you are 
The other oneâ¦ 
A nightmare-Nightmare-nightmare of your own

Thatâs how I feel
But you can figure out
What being my own labyrinth can mean
Thatâs how I feel
But you canât figure out
That I didnât find a place between 

Just easy as OCD
And a bit of borderline
Iâm not the one you see
But I swear I am fine

So and soâ¦ up and down my mind will go

Thatâs a grave-
Thatâs so calm!â!
Thatâs a dwell, Hee Haa!

10 oâclock say hurray
12 oâclock say tired
2 pm say maybe tomorrow it will get better
4 oâclock sheâs falling
9 oâclock sheâs thinking
11 pm say maybe itâs easier with closed eyes
