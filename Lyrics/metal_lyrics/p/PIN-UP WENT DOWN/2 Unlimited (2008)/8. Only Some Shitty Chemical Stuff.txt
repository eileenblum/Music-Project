Oh my love, will you will you be 
Oh you, will you ever be mine?
Oh my love, will you will you be 
Oh you, will you ever be mine?

Depends on your shaker, on your shaker
Depends on your apocrine 
If youâre able to survive the PEA lost 

Always the same stuff
Always the same words
An only pleasant scent.
If youâre not the one,
I only have to waitâ¦

Oh my love, will you will you be 
Oh you, will you ever be mine?
Oh my love, will you will you be 
Oh you, will you ever be mine?

Depends on your shaker, on your shaker
Depends on your apocrine 
If youâre able to survive the PEA lost!

That ainât no soulmate
Nor mawkishness like that
Nor a bunch of violets. 

Always the same stuff
Always the same words
An only pleasant scent.
If youâre not the one,
I only have to waitâ¦

âOh, go, go, go! Make your peacock and sing
with your honeyed voice
Donât be surprised if I spit on your feathers
And what they imply...
You should stop now
Oh, birdy asshole... you just walked on shit... â
