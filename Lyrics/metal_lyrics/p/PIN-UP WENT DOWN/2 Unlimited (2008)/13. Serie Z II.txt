Why do I hear you
Laugh as sheâs rotting?
Parody of Death
Just Theatre of Horror,
Feed your brain
And then ask yourself
Why 
Itâs blur now

Hey, face 
your needs
But pay
the bill

Applause 
murder
Free 
disorder
JusquâoÃ¹, dis, lâextrÃªme ?

Letâs gore 
and see
How mind 
can beâ¦
Applause!

Letâs âcash
for gutsâ
Letâs âwe 
want moreâ

We want more!
