Iâm awayâ¦ 
Iâll do the sameâ¦ 
A dumb death apotheosis 
Impaled âwhy not? -on an iron gate 
Fight with a chainsaw, 
Fight with a lawn mower against a zombie army, 
Rotten from teeth to knees 
I just see 
And Iâll do the same 
I just follow 
I just see 
-I just break down !!!- 
My guts over the floor 
Over the floor 
It smells like âBrain deadâ âand âHill have Eyesâ
Ketchup cum on vomited pies 
Anal Holocaust with reindeers horns 
Or take five lost teens lost in a lost house 
And vow them to fame and royaltiesâ¦ 
Right to the depths of gore 
âbut why?- 
everybody wants more 
Iâll do the same! 
Itâs just grand guignol 

Itâs just grand guignol!
