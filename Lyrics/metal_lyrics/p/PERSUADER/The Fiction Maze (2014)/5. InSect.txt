What you know, what you see, whatever you believe I disagree
From the mold, senses cold, selling everything to philosophy
What can you tell me about my own demise
Beyond the gate, hiding in the shadows
My afterlife

The end of the world awaits me

Someone will save me if I fall
No I am not the only
Never be alone in my monstrosity
They come to hunt me
They'll never catch me
Gateway of time
Your world is mine

You are a miracle, the only one, connected to the father and the son
Self-proclaimed holy men emitting and receiving, they will be done
Bring forth the image that you read in me
Appearance of a solidary savior
Snake underneath

The journey might lead us to war
Never the same, never again
