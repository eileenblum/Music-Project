Torn, divided, deliverance or pain
Master or slave, this endless game
My will ain't stronger than hope
No one weaker than I
A malevolent addiction, born from flesh to sin
A call inside
My blinded mind now in control
I hear the master in my mind
Are you the hellbound one
The demon of mine

All I see, people defiled
Always hiding behind false smiles
Now I am stronger than all
A fearful creature
And when tomorrow comes the emptiness is gone
My journey's just begun

Another tempting of the soul, I can't deny it
Inverted pleasures grow a worm inside

Call for eternal night
Angels and demons
Another nightmare await for us all
With the wind on my back I make my way down to Hell
As we march we will learn not to fear the flame

Like a storm, the rage in us all
Keeping inside a vision clear
There's only vengeance and doom
No mercy, no fear
Rid them of resistance
Designed to fail
My last chapter wrote itself

I hear the master in my mind
Are you the hellbound one
I am God's evil bastard son

The demon is now inside
No use for prayers as shadows fall
Without remorse I shall conquer them all

Falling, leaving all the troubles behind
Bleeding, burning, facing the light
Some things will never change
Just give me a reason to follow the trail of the one

Another tempting of the souls
