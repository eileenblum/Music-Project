[Bonus Track]Belief, all hope behind
Spiritual beings with tormented souls
Are memories frozen in time

There was no warning
Just one with illusion
For the queen of all nature
And the king of it all

Where did it all begin
Screaming inside us
Whisper in the dark
Welcome to the end of the line

When the north wind is coming
No one will ever know
Surrounded by fire
Eight demons align
Down and into free fall

We enter darker dominions
Abundance of ashes cover the land
Devour the sanctuary of man
Deep water and flames

These forces will never change
It's there to fulfillment
Our nucleus fate

Never again will I ever see the sun rise
No one to save me
And nobody knows who I am

When the north wind is coming
No one will ever know
Surrounded by fire
Eight demons align
Turning into dust

We'll return to the to the age of the gods
Never quenching our thirst for decay
We lost our chance in paradise
