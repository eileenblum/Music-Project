Are you the chosen and strong, do you know just where and when
Your own believes surpass those of ordinary men
No room for hesitation, how could I care
Surrender, reform, one promise not granted

You will never be like a fallen
Distorted world perception
The tide is rising, you're losing control
Struggle to reach the other side

Fallen calling up to Heaven's hall
For you and me, a thing that could not be
Come full circle, never return my way
You fail day by day

You are the blinded and weak, far beyond with clouded mind
The praying and preaching made you miss the sign
No time for hesitation
This endless game will perish in flames
A promise I'll grant you

You will never be like a fallen
Distorted world perception
The tide is rising, you're losing control of your own thoughts
Solar scorched
You own being will soon cease to exist
Struggle to reach the other side

You will bleed again from your open scars
A razor to your skin, from this world depart
Freedom gained, in darkness, in pain
Forever trapped, lost inside the night
