All hail the king of madmen, ruler of this void
Befall us now your final word, for aeons come to last
Behold the kingdom of lies, baptized by holy fire
Evolution's end, fanned by the flames of retribution purgatory

Nevermore ceremonial redemption
Reborn by the word of a sad man's song

War, all against all, man versus man
Nothing remains, all hope is gone
To this our darkened fate we're bound forevermore
The darkness of man

Untrue false believers following the light
Redeem yourself in shaded flesh
And what becomes of night
Untold are still the stories that echo through the past
Revolutions wrath
Banned by the lies of the ones of former glory

Destroy, deny
An addiction for our own demise
Foretold, foreseen
A prophecy of an evil dream

Washed away by the hands of time
No sign of hope in sight
