So what's left when all is said and done 
Who would deprive us our light to be
Lunacy unbound
But in the shadows eyes still lure
Awaiting every chance to set us free
Free us from our sanity 

Trapped again 
Haywire jaws
Lashing at us sinners 
With broken fangs and claws 

Fragments of pain will return 
My life's so precious to sacrifice 
To this darkened world
You're my nameless God
Earth you walked for infinity
Shattering my everything

Trapped again 
Haywire jaws
Lashing at us sinners 
With broken fangs and claws 

You know it ain`t right, you know it ain`t so
There's gotta be more to life than you know
Break the chains and see the light again
Maybe you'll beg, maybe you'll pray 
Maybe there's more to life than decay
Trade your soul for one more day 

Finally, my swarming soul is free 
But every time you set on me
You'll be afraid to die
Sends shivers up my spine

[Solo]

Trapped again 
Haywire jaws
Lashing at us sinners 
With broken fangs and claws 

You know it ain`t right, you know it ain`t so
There's gotta be more to life than you know
Break the chains and see the light again
Maybe you'll beg, maybe you'll pray 
Maybe there's more to life than decay
Trade your soul for one more day 

Humanity
A feeling weaker
Then your need to control

So much is asked in silence
My hands are soiled with blood
Your world spawned through violence
EVOLUTION PURGATORY

Trapped again 
Haywire jaws
Lashing at us sinners 
With broken fangs and claws
