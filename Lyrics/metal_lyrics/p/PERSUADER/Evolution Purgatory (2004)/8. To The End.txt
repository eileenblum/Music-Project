To be, to see
What lies beneath the service
It dwells within your heart 
A marriage made in flesh
Welcome damnation

The passion in your eyes
An angel hiding within
So hard to realize
Sensations carved in stone
Are matters now postponed

Desire brings you down
I'm not your saint, nor your sinner
I'm just your devil

To late I awake There's nothing left for me
So flash before me now
A sign of true belief

Awaiting the dreadful dead
The scoundals and the hounds
Nothing stays the same
Your world is coming down 
Closer to the end

Desire brings you down
I'm not your saint, nor your sinner
One more step and you're in hell
Facing the fire
It's not the last goodbye

Life is fading 
Sorrows waiting 
But there isn't only you 
In the kingdom of the dead

Desire brings you down
I'm not your saint, nor your sinner
I push you off the edge 
With two outstretched fingers
And my soul remains free
To the end...
