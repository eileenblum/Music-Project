Mesmerize my existence 
No one knows and never will
Ignorance brought me pleasure 
So the seven deadly sins

Hear me and my calling
Receive my prophecy 
Know the pure face of evil
The truth will set me free

It dwells within your heart 
A dark desire
Your love turns to hate
Now follow me forever 

I m the persuader 
I serve not the human race
Unleash the final fire
And crucify the lie

Cast down, onto earth
Our wings from us they stole
Though deceit feeds on both sides
We will crawl for him no more

Fear thee, one and only
Not held by leash and chain
Skies will burn and mark our return 
You'll die in vain

It dwells within your heart 
A dark desire
Your love turns to hate
Now follow me forever 

I m the persuader 
I serve not the human race
Unleash the final fire
And crucify the lie

Unleash the final fire
And crucify the lie

Shadows
Reflect on the fallen
An assembly of hate
I'm your reaper
Godfather of evil 

I m the persuader 
I serve not the human race
Unleash the final fire
And crucify the lie

Unleash the final fire
And crucify the lie
