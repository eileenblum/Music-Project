Firelit stares takes me deep beneath
The overworld I no longer miss
Choice between the fist of a demon
And the seduction of an angels kiss

In sickness 
In health
Shooting up the stealth 
Wrath and desire of the ancients

Carnage, be done that lit the sun
Behold the black star rising

Wearer of horns
Bringer of pain
Tearing up my soul
A passionate provider
My heart is where the pain grow 

[Chorus:]
You turn your face away 
Another sleepless night
Dark clouds descending
With them a precious sight 

Another place fortold
A palace for the frozen
Pray for the trust 
True to the soil
Believers turn to dust

Cold dry veins, your eyes open wide
Pleasance of light is gone
Always lack of persistence 
The never ending chase is on

The fury 
The rage locked up in a cage 
Breaking the boundaries of existence

Terror and screams 
Don't know what it means 
"Your ignorant virtues, haunt me now"

Final deal set
The end of the line
Inject the paradise 
No longer in control 
Your life flash before your eyes
You're sanctified

[Chorus:]
You turn your face away 
Another sleepless night
Dark clouds descending
With them a precious sight 

Another place fortold
A palace for the frozen
Pray for the trust 
True to the soil

Blinded and drained by the fantasies and lies 
The spark in your eye forever gone
Once strong but challenged by darkness and grief
The flame flickers weak and dies

[Chorus:]
You turn your face away 
Another sleepless night
Dark clouds descending
With them a precious sight 

Another place fortold
A palace for the frozen
Don't share your lust
