I don't care for the riddles unspoken 
March to the cross and believe
My faith is never ending
Now assail the creation of life

No one there to welcome 
A bright light, on a deserted plain 
Your God is absent 
And Heaven abandoned 

We'll find a place, where we're no strangers
Past revelation 
My true dominion

[Chorus:]
Strike down, this fierceful entity
They stand on their ground or they run
Won't cease the morning sun
`cause we stole heaven from the Earth

Harsh, demeaning, endless seaming
This was all I was given
One fatal last mistake
The word of remorse came too late

No one there to welcome 
A bright light, on a deserted plain 
Your God is absent 
And Heaven abandoned 

[Chorus:]
Strike down, this fierceful entity
They stand on their ground or they run
Won't cease the morning sun
`cause we stole heaven from the Earth

[Stick:]
We'll find our way there
And then return
We'll bring the storms

[Chorus:]
Strike down, this fierceful entity
They stand on their ground or they run
Won't cease the morning sun
`cause we stole heaven from the Earth
