Another evening 
Another night closes in
The young ones fall asleep
It won't be long
'till your minds cease to be

Time for the final round
The walls are closing on me
The sights won't go away
It won't be long
Your flesh will be ours

Set my desire free
It's hard to see
When you're watching through misty eyes

We're searching for the cure 
From time to time submit
No one is left untouched
And no one can escape
Our passion

Climbing higher now
Plain of distortion secured 
The scene of our decay
Why interfere 
Let the madness begin 

Master
You know I am been waiting
There's someone here with me
The pain won't go away
Set me free
