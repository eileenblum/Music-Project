Run Away
Together at heart, but weak in spirits
Formation facing, what's left behind
Taking turns in surrendering
To the faceless world
Turn out the light

Realize, visualize
Cause your feelings aren't sober
Turn out the night

You have been sentenced so run for you life
A sick addiction, beware the hunter

I stood there breathless, the clouds faded away
And a new dawn brought the sun

Summoning the dark, with no intentions
The trail is waiting, not laid to rest
For how long can you fight them
Courage running low, turned out for life

I'm facing my paradise forgotten
But restless here I stand, forever
Awaiting a life without shadows
All is lost, but I see a new beginning

Interfere, scratch the surface
And the beauty is rotten and dead
The sense is gone, release your curses
A scene of fire and lead
