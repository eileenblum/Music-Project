All, built upon a meaning
A sentence that was drained with horror
You've dreamed about the dreaming
The images of lies and sorrow

So where do you go
You might wonder how
And how did it show
Your time is here, now

Our own creation
Welcome to the promised land above
This is the yearning
Of the land where no one ever walks alone

From, the chaos you created
Experiment annihilation
With all around related
A mixture of dark sensations

Blessed be, your sins will be forgiven
Face me, your demons will be driven

Destroyed at all cost
