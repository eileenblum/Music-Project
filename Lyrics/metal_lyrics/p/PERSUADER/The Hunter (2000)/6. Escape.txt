I can't get away from the past of my life
I must look forward, kill the pain, deny the past
But when I'm alone in the dark
My thoughts start running through my mind
And the sweat on my forehead begins to drip
I've seen it in my dreams

I will not fall, but the edge is close enough now
I hope tomorrow I will see the dawn again
I will not fall, but the edge is closer now
I hope tomorrow I will see the dawn again

Voices are calling from somewhere beyond
Now I'm out there, all alone
Voices are calling, but nothing remains
My paradise is stained

Don't be afraid, it will guide you through the night
Bright eyes are watching you now
It gives you strength now to carry on, the past is alive

Now I'm facing it, the past of my life
Breathing down my neck, I can't escape my own demise
Its staring back at me, dark, beauty, truth
The thought I lost has now been found

Don't be afraid, it will guide you through the night
The flame in the torch will never pass out
Unless, I find my way to paradise
Please let me go, I wanna live my life alone
You can't stand before me, this is my last chance to survive
The blackened sky will take me away
