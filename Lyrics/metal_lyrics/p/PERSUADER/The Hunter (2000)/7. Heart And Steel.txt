Out of chaos born
In a time when glory lost control
A fallen angel long forgotten
Found its way to conquer your life and soul

We gather our forces, protecting our lands
The demon is calling, your blood it demands
Raise your hands

Heart and steel, forever we will fight with
Heart and steel, we will prevail

Morning comes as shadows fall
Now the time has come to fight them all
When the night awaits, clutch at straws
That was the picture that I thought I saw

He'd watched and waited for so many years
Holding alone the desolate shore
Lonely but faithful to his trust
Forever holding those days of joy
