There was no sympathy
No way to escape
And nothing mattered
Behold the final day
Confusion and fear
The few were gathered

How many steps are there left to go
How many miles to the land

The bringer of light walks among us
Trading a promise
Betrayal is your gift
My life for you

And so they wandered
Their journey began
A search not granted
But eyes did watch them
A none human shape
Flew 'cross the mountains

Chaos
Burning
Meltdown
Nightfall
Fusion
Breakdown
