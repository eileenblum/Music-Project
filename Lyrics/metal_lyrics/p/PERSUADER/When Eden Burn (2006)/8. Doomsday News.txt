For some time I looked at the world
Through the eyes of damnation
Dark sights, they hide away from the sun
In the doomsday city I run

In a stream of cruel diminishing thoughts
Darkness shadows the light inside
People not convinced, laughing
End of mankind, wither and die

In denial the fools will carry on
A face unseen will show you what I mean
When the legions arise to destroy

Another day has come to end
No one heard my prophecy
And if tomorrow brings decay
Then it's only my price to pay

Now look, ripping divine serpent
Slither into their minds
Destined to be, eternally
But you are the filth, and death is my God

From the grave black, rise and follow
The strong will remain
All there is left, this eternal horror
Now blood falls like rain
