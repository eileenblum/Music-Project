Alone under the sun, just an animated ghost
This prison is unbreakable
I am passing through the dreamridden sequence
Leave of absence denied

Time is here, time has come, there's no denial
I call for the fallen ones
A voice going insane

Reaching out, close the circle or finish your bottle
You're weak in dream, in life supreme
I'm colored by the things that we love

Excited eyes of few, and the glares of the untrue
Freak breathing down my neck
May the sweet relief divine seduce me
Possessed once again

Lost all sense of reality
Wanna see the inside of you
Watch the shadow reflecting mirror
Undress the unpure
Let justice be done
