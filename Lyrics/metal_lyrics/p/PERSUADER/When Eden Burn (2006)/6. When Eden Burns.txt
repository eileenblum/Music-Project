Every morning, every night
Every hour of the day you pray
Your life's flawless
You find comfort in your faith
Without truth there's no turning back
Your passing might seem right
And here is your maker
You will be reborn a million ways

You're here but your mind is dreaming
Illusions

So it's written
Daylight and freedom will never be
When Eden burns
And stars shine no more
The end of your fantasy

Revived and awake
What is this place, what am I doing here
Expected heaven but found the gates of hell
Save me from this nightmare
Where's the promised land
You are complete now
Rejoice a million years

Flames high, the ground is burning
Rain whipping my skin
Forever lost therein
