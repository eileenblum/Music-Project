There's no need for your prayers
As you catch your final breath
The figure before me couldn't matter any less

Through my life guilt and terror fed
My conviction was not to end
I long for the revolution
Made to be the servant of the black

One mind tied to my heart
Fallen angels wait, your kingdom will come

We were led astray
Life passed away
When the slave becomes the master
We will all be remembered
I know what tomorrow brings to me
Justice, black desire
Insanity spinning faster
Sending you back to hell!

You're in my world now, look at me
No one but us in this gathering
Salvation for you will never be
I am your master, kneel for me

Your prayers couldn't save you
Power shifted to me
Superior empire rise
