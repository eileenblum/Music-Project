Used to walk among thee
Like a stranger to the dominant
Do you ever feel it, like a cancer in your mind
Crave for more, it's always there
Distrust is pulling me back

I'm sacred, unholy, I am faithful and false
It all comes together as one

Remove the silence and give birth to my demise
Fast I fall away from heaven
With God as my witness, one day I will return
With hell on my shoulders

I will let it all go now and be free from my burden
Hear my final warning
It is time - Annihilate
In their eyes I'm always there
But my heart is wearing a mask

You are not there just yet
Good things they come to an end
One pure true belief
