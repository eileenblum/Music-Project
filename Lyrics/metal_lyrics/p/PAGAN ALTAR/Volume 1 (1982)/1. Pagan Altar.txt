Dawning of a brand new day,
lighting up the way,
with something new to say,
From beyond the stars.

A warning of the times gone by,
No tears left to cry,
Just a mournful sigh.
From beyond the stars.

Spawning from an Astral grave,
No souls left to save,
Floating on a wave ,
From beyond the stars.

Burning life's eternal fire,
Dictated by desire,
A Pagan Altar high,
From beyond the stars.

Morning of a Pagan reign,
Nothing is the same,
Scream out Satan's name,
From beyond the stars.

Dawning of a brand new day,
Lighting up the way,
Something new to say,
From beyond the stars.
