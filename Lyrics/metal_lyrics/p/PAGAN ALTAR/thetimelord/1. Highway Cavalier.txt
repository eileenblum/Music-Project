I ride the highway of life
Living carefree
Going down life's back streets
Being what I want to be
And I'm meeting people
People like me
Everyone who feels the need to be free

No authority can check me
On my crash course to Hell
Nobody needs to save me
Don't wanna hear that bell
Living free and easy
That's how it's gonna be
Yeah free - free to be me!

I am moving so fast
You'll never catch me
I'm just a blur before your eyes
Sailing on the breeze
Living free and easy
That's how it's gonna be
Yeah free - free to be me!
