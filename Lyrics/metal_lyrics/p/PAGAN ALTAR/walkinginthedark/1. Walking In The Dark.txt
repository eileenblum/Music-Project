Demons in my brain, lighting fires
Driving me insane.
I can't stand the pain, of my existence
I can't live again
'Cos I'm walking, walking, walking in the dark.

I can't see no light
No point of reference, I'm giving up the fight.
I've tried with all my might, I've been persistent,
But it's hopeless without sight.
I've been walking, walking, oh walking,
Walking in the dark.

Death's an open door, eternal sleep
I couldn't ask for more.
My spirits on the floor, I've no resistance
Can't take any more
I'm walking, walking,
Walking in the dark.
