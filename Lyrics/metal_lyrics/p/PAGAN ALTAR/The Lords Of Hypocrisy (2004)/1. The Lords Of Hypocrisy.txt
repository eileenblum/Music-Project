Figures of Religion that preach to society, standing upright and tall
Screaming from the pulpit on Sunday morning
To save you from the fall
Can you hear them?
Can you see them?
Don't believe them; don't believe what they say!

Tales of heaven and life everlasting fear of the eternal fire,
Preaching lies of death and damnation,
Whilst lifting themselves ever higher.
Can you hear them?
Can you see them?
Don't believe them; don't believe what they say!

Death will come to even the righteous only the good die young.
So live your life the way that you want to,
Don't let them think they've won!
Can you hear them?
Can you see them?
Don't believe them don't believe what they say!

Unlock their minds and read their desires,
See them in a different light.
Pious figures reverently mumbling
But where did they spend last night?

They're creatures of the night,
They're creatures of the shadows,
That haunts the dark recesses of your mind,
They turn you from the light to live in a nightmare
Into souls that are mentally blind!
