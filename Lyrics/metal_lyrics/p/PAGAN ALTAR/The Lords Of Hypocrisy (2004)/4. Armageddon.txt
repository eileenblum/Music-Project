"It has been predicted there will be three world wars, two have already past".
"The third is to be the end of life on this planet as we know it".
"The place or battle site for the final conflict between good and evil is called,
ARMAGEDDON"!

People are coming from all over the World heading for Armageddon,
Building themselves a 'man made Hell' starting at Armageddon.
They don't know that their time is running out'
Can't they see it's the Worlds lifeblood that's coming out!

Warlords are plotting all over the world, planning for Armageddon,
Waiting in trenches for the opening bell, rung out at Armageddon.
They don't know that their time is running out'
Can't they see it's the Worlds lifeblood that's coming out!

Good and evil all over the World meeting at Armageddon,
But you won't need heaven and you won't need hell after Armageddon.
They don't know that their time is running out'
Can't they see it's the Worlds lifeblood that's coming out!

I can see the fire of hate in their eyes,
The Sunset of this World is drawing near.
The Erl king doffs his hat in mock affection,
The moment he has prayed for is now here!

It's no good you hiding in the subways,
The end of mankind has just begun.
The hand of death will reach you where you're hiding,
Perhaps in a million years we'll live again!

"Down through the centuries man has had his warnings, but still he took no heed"!
