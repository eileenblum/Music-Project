Dark riders with flowing robes, the power of death within them flows.
Riding out across the sky
Satan's henchmen flying by.

Black stallions with silent hooves glide gracefully across the roofs.
Flared nostrils and fiery eyes,
Satan's henchmen ride the skies.

Spread out to all four winds, to leave their curse wherever they've been.
Night riders hunting souls,
Satan's henchman, Witches dolls.

Horse and rider appear as one, to disappear before the rising sun.
Fading shadows in the morning light,
Satan's henchmen rule the night
