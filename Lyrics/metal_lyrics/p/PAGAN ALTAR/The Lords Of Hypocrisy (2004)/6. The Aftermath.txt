Screaming, awful screaming the smell of carnage fills the air.
Then silence, complete silence, death and destruction everywhere.

Nothing, there is nothing, nothing at all left alive.
Annihilation, complete annihilation, the angel of death has arrived.

Cities turned to ashes whole Continents have died.
The mushroom clouds still linger on
Blackening the skies!

Charred trees, reaching skywards, like hands held limply in the air.
Scorched fields, barren landscape, no one left alive to care.
Now that the fires have gone
There's no one to right all the wrong,
No one to right all the wrong!

Warning after warning but still they took no heed.
Thoughts only of the power, Ideology and greed.
