From a Castle high on the top of a hill
I can hear the Witch Queen laughing still.
As midnight chimes and the moon is high
The Witch Queen prepares herself to fly.

She stands on top of a tower of stone
And sneers at the sleeping earth below.
Unsuspecting in their beds
Of the gathering of Witches above their heads.

In silent flight across the sky
All ranks of Witches flying by.
Paying homage to their Queen
At their yearly meeting on Halloween.

I can see her.
I can see her standing there
I can see her she's poised and ready
Moonlight on long black hair.

Her laughter breaks the still of night
Music to match the awesome sight.
In ghostly silence they follow their Queen
Like dead leafs blowing in the wind.

I can see her.
I can see her standing there
I can see her she's poised and ready
Moonlight on long black hair.

I can see her.
I can see her standing there
I can see her as she gracefully rises
A death like hush as she takes the air.
