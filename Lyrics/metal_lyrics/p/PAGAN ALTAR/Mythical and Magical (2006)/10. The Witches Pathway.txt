Fire- burn in Hell,
It's a cry that we know so well
Fire- to cleanse your soul
But you know that's the way you've gotta go.
Passing through the barriers of time
Forget the pain think only of your line.

Fire-opens the door
It's a gateway to life forever more.
Fire- burning bright
Wont you show me the pathway with your light.
Passing through the barriers of time
Forget the pain think only of your line
Showing me the way to live another day
In a future that soon will be mine.

Fire- cast your spell
You were spawned in the very bowels of Hell.
Fire- Witches bane.
They don't know they're starting it again.
Passing through the barriers of time
Forget the pain think only of your line
Showing me the way to live another day
In a future that soon will be mine!
