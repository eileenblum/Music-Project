The child's laughter ceased
As he tiptoed by
That dreaded open door
With a cursory glance into its depths,
as if to reassure
He never really understood,
what first made him hate that room
But childish intuition knew,
something lurked within its gloom
He knew the room held many things,
that came from long ago
But why they were kept within that room,
a child of eight wouldn't know

He sensed a dark force that dwelt within,
that watched his every move
Hidden deep within the shadowy bowels,
of that accursed room
It took every bit of courage,
to retrieve that bouncing ball
That always rolled into that room,
when he was playing in the hall
Sheer terror would grip the child's heart,
if he found himself alone
And a glimpse of a fleeting figure,
would turn his legs to stone

He would lay a salt trail all around the room,
for why he never knew
But a voice from deep within him,
told him exactly what to do
Adults seem quite unaware,
of the demon that waits inside
And laugh at his reluctance,
to cross that threshold line

The adults lost their perception of,
the truth only a child can see
The price we pay for material gain,
the price for material greed

The years have passed and the memories dim
The child is now full grown
Still living in the family house
With young children of his own
His sights are now firmly set upon
The furthering of his life
Aided and abetted, by a materialistic wife
But his eldest son, has a morbid fear
Of the antiques room off the hall
And eh keeps leaving a trail of salt along
The room's permeter wall
