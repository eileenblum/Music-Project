An eerie silence descends upon,
every graveyard and burial ground
A distant church striking midnight,
Is the only living sound
The stillness of the nighttime air,
slowly fills with impending doom
As a mask of cloud rolls across the sky,
to blot out the blood red moon.

A cloak of mist creeps through crumbling walls,
to carpet the graveyard floor
To encircle the disused chapels,
and block up their rotting doors
It swirls around forgotten tombs,
with obliterated names
While night shadows flit and dance between,
the unattended graves

Cold chill of death is all around,
carried on the wings of hate
As an unseen hand forces open
the rusty cemetery gates
Burning resentment of the living,
that's aimed at all mankind
Feeds the anguish of the long dead souls,
lying in the ground

The time has come, the time is here,
the entire world will see
The gates of hell have opened,
Satan now walks free
The forgotten army lie beneath the earth,
Await his siren call
The voice from within the deepest realm,
heard by one and all

Gravestones tilt and shudder,
And slip below the ground
Marble pillars that have stood for years,
topple and come crashing down
Sealed tombs gape wide open,
to lay bare the corpse inside
At the order of their master,
they open their sightless eyes

The time has come, the time is here,
the entire world will see
The gates of hell have opened,
Satan now walks free
Forgotten army lie beneath the earth,
have answered the Clarion call
The being from within the deepest realm,
he leads them one and all.

As one they strive to move dead limbs,
to walk the earth once more
Soldiers of the past are called to arms,
awakens them as before
Driven on by fake memory,
of injustice and the pain
A rotting hand breaks through the earth,
To clutch the sky again
