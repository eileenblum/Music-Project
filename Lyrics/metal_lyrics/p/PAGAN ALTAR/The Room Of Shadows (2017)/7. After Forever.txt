Cascading leaves of gold and russet brown
Like my life's descending spiral floating down
The sylvan setting mirror in my soul
Passion only for the silver and gold

It seems like a thousand years
Since I let you go
In a world so full of greed I didn't know
But now I'm on death's door we'll e together
And I'll be with you then and after forever
