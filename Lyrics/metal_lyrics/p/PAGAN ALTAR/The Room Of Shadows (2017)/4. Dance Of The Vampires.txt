Lengthening shadows, mark the end of another day
And then enters into a twilight world,
where the Vampire hold sway
Dusk falls like a curtain, to welcome in the night
And the rising moon beckons them again
To join in the dance of death

Awakening figures, in answer to the call
Resplendent in all their finery,
as they file into the hall
The mirror holds no reflection,
of this entourage of dead
And the dust lays undisturbed, on the floor
To bear no witness to the dance of death

Crinoline dresses and brocade coats of gold
Minuet in the candle light, as the grandeur unfolds
Down through many centuries,
they've learned their steps so well
To move and sway so gracefully,
to the orchestra from hell
To the strains of the dance of death

To feed upon the living,
is their object and desire
And they care not
for the material things of life
The dance is just a prelude,
a matinee before the morn
As they scatter to the four winds,
to return before the dawn

They don't see the cobweb portals,
where time has passed them by
Or the rat-infested catacombs,
of the vaults where they lie
The dance is just a prelude,
a matinee before the morn
As they scatter to the four winds,
to return before the dawn
