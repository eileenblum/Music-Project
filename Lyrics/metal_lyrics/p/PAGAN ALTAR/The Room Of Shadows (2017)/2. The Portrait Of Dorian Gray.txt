If you would sit within a darkened room
With a candle to one side
Look hard into the mirror
And just focus on your eyes
As you sink deeper into your soul
Your outline will slowly fade
To be replaced by a devils mask
Or the portrait of Dorian Gray

As you stare into the parallel world
What do you really see?
The reflection looking back at you
Is not the face that used to be?
The years have passed so swiftly
Like a flash across the skies
The countenance of youth has gone
Or perhaps the mirror lies?

What demon lurks within its depths?
Or just a face you wish to hide
Maybe you've passed beyond the glass
To view from the other side

Don't wait till the clock strikes midnight
Or you will open up a door
And loose the demons that what lies within
That could touch your very soul
Don't wait until the witching hour
Marks the end of another day
Or you will unleash the dark forces
And the curse of Dorian Gray

Are you seeing what lies in store?
When time has had its way
Or are you seeing what really is
Like the portrait of Dorian Gray
