A ricochet, from the heart, my blood is rising enough to blow apart, a circulation of satisfaction, a bloodbath
like the Victorians falls...FREEDOM, to rip your heart out - FREEDOM, to play the god
it doesn't matter which side you're gonna take, WE'RE EQUAL HERE!!
and you play the role (you play it all alone), and your flavour... RAW!!
THIS TIME I WON'T FAKE INSANITY, MY NEVERENDING RACE 'TIL I LOSE MY GRIP
SO FORGET, FORGIVE WHATEVER IS THAT I'M LONGING FOR, I DRIVE FOR...
ADRENALINE, ADRENALINE, ADRENALINE, ADRENALINE....
RED! STREAM! FLOWS! DOWN BELOW! Where your emotions deep rejected.
I am the growing seed of pain, THE PUNISHMENT OF ALL!
six cuts in a blink of an eye...I've waited for a lifetime...
To come inside and get what's mine, AND RISE UP!!
and you play the role (you can't get enough of it), and your flavour... RAW!!
THIS TIME I WON'T FAKE INSANITY, MY NEVERENDING RACE 'TIL I LOSE MY GRIP
SO FORGET, FORGIVE WHATEVER IS THAT I'M LONGING FOR, I DRIVE FOR...
THIS TIME I WON'T FAKE MY SINCERITY, YEAH, I'VE WALKED THE LINE SO FAR WITH A TRUTH SO THIN SO FULLFILL
THE WILL TO KILL WITH EVERYTHING, IVE BEEN DEAD WAY TOO LONG SO FEED ME, FEED ME...
ADRENALINE, ADRENALINE, ADRENALINE, ADRENALINE....
