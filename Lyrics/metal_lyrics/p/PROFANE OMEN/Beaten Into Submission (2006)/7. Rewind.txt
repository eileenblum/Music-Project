Open your ears now!

Worn out from all your bullshit
And I won't kill my pride and let you rule inside me (no!)
Know this, you're good for nothing
And your opinions make zero effect

Rewind! You're all out of time
Before I start antagonizing my kind
Rewind! I'll piss on your pride
The lies, the smiles, you fed me all this time...

How many times must I try, before you open your ears?

Your name, another quitter on my list
And your lack of faith amuses us all
(Now!) Face this - you cannot beat me
And my back is already full of your knives,
So stab me again!

How many fists will I raise for you to hear what I say?
Nothing will ever change this - the fact you gave up on me

One, incoming two
I told you three times
Four, straight I kicked your ass!

How many fists will I raise for you to hear what I say?
Nothing will ever change this: the fact you gave up on me
I refuse to go weak and insecure,
I refuse to inherit that from you

Rewind! You're all out of time
Before I start antagonizing my kind
Rewind! I'll piss on your pride
The lies, the smiles, you fed me all this time...
