Don't waste my time, soul repairer...
For the blood that's gone dry, drained out from those who believed not.
Changing, changing my second skin....
Placing, placing my disbeliefs...

I'm all let open, was not closed all times.
Things we shared - hopeless, would you beat me blind...

Hold on to the pain that's never changing,
you will feel it when all your love is gone...
Hail to the king baby! HAIL HAIL!
You will love it when all your love is wrong...
I'M DONE WITH YOU ALL!

Tearing myself into pieces, all the characters I've shown,
I destroy them all by leaving one, the tired, through and done.
Innocence creeping, don't wanna know your name...
On one thing we agree: purity's in vain...

Hold on to the pain that's never changing,
you will feel when all your love is gone...
Hail to the King baby! HAIL HAIL!
You will love it when all your love is wrong...
I'M DONE WITH YOU...

WOULD YOU FUCK ME HOLLOW? SENSELESS?
WILL YOU TOUCH ME WHEN ALL YOUR LOVE IS WRONG???
