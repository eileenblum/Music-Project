[spoken]
From now on it's... total fucking darkness.

RESTORE IT!

Fall from grace, can we keep up the pace while desperately trying to adjust,
One mistake after millions made, for your sake it doesn't make any fucking difference

In it's name we all die, all vanished, proven the blame by scars
and this scheme of mankind lives within through the eyes of a child.

How can we tolerate all this, I think we've swallowed enough to ignore it,
In this chase for immortality, the air runs out from those who built resistance

Nobody owns this land, this soil is for none of us to fight (for), THEN WE DIE!
We born and die misunderstood, wasting our lives.

This thing that really scares me is that you're not able to GET THIS:
Take, take, take, everything you take until it's all drained.

[chorus]
FREEDOM! They all talk about it. But it never gets more crucial than now
FREEDOM! They all choke on it. Our lives are now and the now goes to waste...

Under the same sun, we born and die
Misunderstood and wasting our lives

This picture's getting dark and the victim's pile up and this picture's getting dark and the victims pile up and the currency is blood and the victims pile up and this picture's getting dark and the currency is blood, WE PAY!

This thing that really scares me is that you're not able to GET THIS:
Take, take, take, everything you take, it's the way of the world these days.

The only way to survive is to shut down and turn off our minds,
The new generations born without humanity,
There is no cure for the greed, this type of green never sets us free,
we don't communicate (oh no, no...), we're overdosed and DISCONNECTED!

FREEDOM! They all talk about it. But it never gets more crucial than now
FREEDOM! They all choke on it. After generations their empires are burning, burning...
