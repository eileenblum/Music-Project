[music: Kurki / lyrics: Kurki]

Most of my deeds have not fed my pride and some of them could make me choke in shame.
Even if my heart (for what it's worth) is to grow, the end, the end remains the same.
Regret is for fools, to me remorse holds no relief, what if the meaning of all this is
Learning to die in peace

[chorus]
The meaning of all this is to learning to die in peace,
The meaning of everything is learning to die...

Today my blood runs cold and there's no light left in my eyes.
Have I cared enough for the ones I love?
Did my hatred cause enough pain? Was I worthy to reach that day?
What is the goddamn difference if we're all here just learning to die in peace.

The meaning of all this is to learning to die in peace,
The meaning of everything is learning to die...

Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Don't save your breath...
