[music: Kurki, Profane Omen / lyrics: NÃ¤veri]

Break this circle, the one that keeps me captured in this shell,
Once lost, but not forsaken, I'm wandering through this citadel.
I've shed myself to these shadows which amplify my sins and
Forever they will lead me to this glory of the fallen,
once again the step's been taken
And I keep on gaining on the gates of ruin

[chorus]
Breed suffocation
The final remedy,
Breed extinction
Reborn to breed again

Times, how many times do I get to find my way out?
This pattern is repeated by every man preceding me.
It's blackening, the walls speak out their thoughts,
and I close the gate of suffering, completing the shape of round,
our monument of trust torn down.

Breed suffocation
The final remedy,
Breed extinction
Reborn to breed again

LET THE GUILT FULFILL ME, LET THE GUILT FULFILL ME

Stuck in this circle with you and a gun,
This situation's gone worse than we feared,
Don't you dare to put your trust in me...
I'm way more than you want me to be...
Unleashed, hurting and unleashed, hurting myself again...

LET THE GUILT FULFILL ME, LET THE GUILT FULFILL ME

Breed suffocation
The final remedy,
Breed extinction
Reborn to breed again

In this circle, blames forgotten, tools of passion smothered...
