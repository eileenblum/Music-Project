I keep my base...
I watched our common wealth go down with your preaching, dead empty words like those belong to the self-righteous...
Do you have a clue what it means to breath in hell?
I don't, but I know the have-not's who constantly are wearing the pain.
Hate-bred, youth outraged, my arrival violated, you better repent this!
Systematized oppression in the heart of our community, now that's lobotomy.
I refuse to be one-sided 'cause the world is so divided; no, that's not a part of me.
Staring at the lunacy, the art of man's morality, in this society,
I choose the way of battle, scream my voice until it shatters (shatters).
ARE YOU WITH ME?
I KEEP MY BASE...
These evil minds that only criticise are the ones to blame.
By dividing our stand, they leave us begging from hands, from hands, that don't give a fuckin' damn...
Hate-bred, youth outraged, my arrival violated, you better repent this!
Your threats, out of range, sure as hell I'm dedicated, to transform your words into a death wish...
...In this golden age of desperate need, why we stand still?
...And before they know, they can see us from their backyards while we bring the war to their doorsteps...
