Information, let the freedom flow!
Transformation, let this demon go!
Let the light shine on all of our restraints, the ones that always keep us in place.
We start this debate on who's the master and the chief; I'm sure you always wanted to be...
You're twisting, commanding, manipulating me.
The nonexistent you're making me to see.
I'M TURNING into two, the mad and the sane. This battle tears the virtues within.
The bullet's inside and penetrates my mind.
I'm trapped in you and the horror comes alive...
Let me stay alive for the wave that begins to rise...
Fight, fight, fight for my sanity.
INFORMATION!
The more resistance grows, the more I'm free.
LET THE FREEDOM FLOW!
Fight, fight for the change to be.
TRANSFORMATION!
It all starts with the trigger and me.
LET THIS DEMON GO!
Break the shadows and the darkness deep within, losing all the thoughts of defeat.
Start your engine; become the chaos machine, with mayhem in your every heartbeat.
Embracing the righteous, the fight that you're in, weakness is a mortal sin, OUR EVERY SIN!
Live to the fullest, pure heart the final keep. Join me now, or join the flock of sheep...
The bullet's inside and penetrates my mind.
I'm trapped in you and the horror comes alive... ALIVE!
The bullet's inside and penetrates my mind;
I'm trapped in you and the horror comes alive...
Let me stay alive for the wave that begins to rise...
Behind these insane eyes, no one is your guide...
Information, let the freedom flow!
Transformation, let this demon go! ALIVE!
