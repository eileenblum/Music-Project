Keep your mouth shut 'cause there is nothing wrong.
Just hold it back for some social peace.
Don't think twice about unpleasant thoughts 'cause there might be something nice on TV.
Commercial breaks -- telling what you want, information harnessed -- supporting the fraud,
boneheads in the limelight -- pig shit to transcend, cash for a prize -- want to be one of them?
Fill in the blanks in your un-aimed mind, plastic for you to spend your time on marching invasion overtakes us all and the seconds are running out.
Tools of misleading! Keeping the sheep in use, you're denying that comfort is your excuse.
You have to realize that you are being had; computer games just caught you -- too bad.
No reset, no restart, no defence, no game saved, only an artificial frame.
So damn many easy ways to dodge, products made of money replacing a cause.
No real challenge, hey it might be hard.
The easy way out brought us this far. (And it will take us all the way to the end)
Fill in the blanks in your un-aimed mind, plastic for you to spend your time on marching invasion overtakes us all, and the seconds are running out.
THE END:
What the fuck did you expect?
How did you think it was going to end?
Life is not a movie with a Hollywood ending to watch or a video game that you can practise over and over again.
Life is not a competition of buying piles of shit we don't need.
We can't choose the beginnings of our lives, we have way too little time to figure the middles out and the endings just don't matter.
So why should we spend any part of our lives in the void that is so easily inherited from one generation to another?
Just because everyone else does?
If we paid a bit more attention to the things that we really want to be our legacy, we might understand the one that was passed on to us.
Or, we can spend our time dodging the thoughts too heavy to bear with someone else's way to escape.
It's just that we don't have too much time left to break the chain...
