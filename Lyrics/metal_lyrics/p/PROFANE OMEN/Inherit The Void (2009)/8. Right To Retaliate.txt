Replacing a life of choice with emptiness, I didn't want to be spoken for.
Walking in a world of fear, one thought in my mind I hold so dear; you gotta suffer, you gotta pay!
Rest in pieces; rest in your shame. Rest in pieces, in pieces of pain.
Demanding difference to replace the hate I feel, to walk among the wolves you have to carry the darkness in your veins.
To eliminate the enemy I have to become one.
I wear your skin and curse your gods as I greet the blood red sun.
Far too late to feel remorse, so bend your knees as I lay you rest in...
Rest in pieces; rest in your shame. Rest in pieces, in pieces of pain.
You built me a world made of things I've grown to hate, but this world also gives me the right, the right to retaliate.
I rise outnumbered. Shatter your beliefs onto the floor, no barriers no more.
Waste the waste for one good cause, for everything that's lost, for everything that's loved.
You built me a world made of things I've grown to hate, but this world also gives me the right, the right to retaliate.
With a loveless caress as my prize, fight to my death I rise outnumbered as I am to retaliate.
I rise outnumbered, my deeds justified; outnumbered I rise, my deeds very just.
Like a razor slashing through my bones, I reconcile.
