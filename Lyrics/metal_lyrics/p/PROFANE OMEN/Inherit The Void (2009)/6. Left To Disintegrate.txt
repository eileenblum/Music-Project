How will you feel, how will your mind adjust when you get the fact that will change it all?
Wanna be a better man?
Just leave it all to a higher hand and watch it all go down.
Your time is nigh. Your time has passed so fast, on a pointless purpose that ain't yours.
You wander on, fall through the rest of your days, all the way to your fuckin' grave...
Now beginning the struggle to be swallowed, within these flames you've woken, will broken.
You're swallowed, swallowed...
You don't want to burn down and still you embrace these flames.
THAT'S YOUR DISGRACE!
That's, your, disgrace!
LEFT TO DISINTEGRATE!
We don't want to burn down, and still we embrace these flames.
THAT'S OUR DISGRACE!
Changing beliefs but still everything stays the same.
We're left to, left to,
DISINTEGRATE!
You don't want to burn down, and still you embrace these flames.
THAT'S YOUR DISGRACE!
Changing beliefs but still everything stays the same.
You're left to, left to, DISINTEGRATE!
And you should know about the need that lies way underneath; it's crooked and wrong and shows you're weak, but you don't believe that.
All that you have, having it won't save your ass from the useless days that have passed.
No higher purpose for some shared good cause, no salvation at the end of the story you have willingly bought.
Still you keep on resisting to be swallowed, but within these flames you've woken, will broken, you're swallowed, swallowed...
