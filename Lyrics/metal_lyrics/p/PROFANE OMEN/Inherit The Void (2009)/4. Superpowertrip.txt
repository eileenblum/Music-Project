And I have not witnessed justice; therefore I have no reasons to play it fair.
All these wrong-turn exits turning to right ones, it's up to me, it's up to me. Now I decide...
...how I should live, by the day, and create...
Start believing me; there is no one else you see.
I'm a riot of one man and I won't trade my soul.
I know this in my heart; you won't bring me to my knees.
You better criticise exactly who you are.
WHO ARE YOU!?
It's not about the skills or your abilities.
You don't learn this life by copy-paste; no, you decide.
Now free yourself from from self restraints; don't belong.
It's in your head, all in your head. Now you decide...
...how you should live, by this day, and create...
I DECIDE how I should live, by the day, and create...
Start believing me; there is no one else you see.
I'm a riot of one man and I won't trade my soul.
I know this in my heart; you won't bring me to my knees.
You better criticise exactly who you are.
Start believing me; I know this in my heart and you won't find me on my knees.
You better criticise exactly who you are.
WHO ARE YOU!?
