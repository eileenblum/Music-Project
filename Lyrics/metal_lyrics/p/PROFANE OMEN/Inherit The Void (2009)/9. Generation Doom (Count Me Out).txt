HE-RI-TACE!
What is left from yesterday?
Only violence and the sense of greed -- I gag!
A shallow world where crises are solved with a sum of all our fears...
There's too many problems now; we're at the point of no return (dead end now).
We're forced to look the other away, while all this decays...
Poisoned by this need to kneel...
I wash my face with filth, confession incomplete,
And I leave this place in fires, hoping it'll learn someday.
A future where handguns are leading the way is something I can't take, bang bang!
Traditions of a culture buried under the agony of men...
It's a race of self-destruction -- who can beat the odds?
And we can read our names in today's obituary...
Poisoned by this need to kneel...
I wash my face with filth, confession incomplete,
And I leave this place in fires, hoping it'll learn someday.
COUNT, ME, OUT (from this abomination).
Drained out...
I keep on washing my face with filth this confession's left incomplete.
And I leave this place in fires, in fires...
and hope you will learn someday...
