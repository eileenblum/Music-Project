Screaming for freedom!

From this house of Hades
I'm bound to flee!
Driven by the horrors I have seen
Screaming for freedom!
Running 'til I'm safe
No matter how it ends as long as I am brave

Like birds of fire in my dreams
I leave this land of fear and greed
Like birds of fire in my dreams
My heart is free

The devil is on my trail
Giving up means going down in flames
The devil wants us all
Glorious the flight before the fall

Out of the woods of intended ignorance
I storm armed with the truth
Spiral through ashes and the bloodred dust
Just above the evil that men do

Screaming for freedom!
Like birds of fire in my dreams
I leave this land of fear and greed
Like birds of fire in my dreams
My heart is free

[2x]
Screaming for freedom!
Perpetrated wisdom

[2x]
The devil is on my trail
Giving up means going down in flames
The devil wants us all
Glorious the flight before the fall
