Storm inside
The bottle
Flames sustain
Our liberty

Board sealed canvas
Nailed up to the grey
Concrete barriers
Walls have been raised

Smoldering ashes
Ignited by rage
Burning embers
Constellations of sky

Freedom
Another half of the coin
Illusion
Utter and perspective

Scavengers
Lurking among the prey
Pack of hunters
Wolves among men

Flash of light
Snipers without clip
Social disorder
Pressure as it hits

Truth inked on paper
Bread and circuses
Flickering screens
Visions of the blinded

Freedom
Another half of the coin
Illusion
Utter and perspective

Spreading disease
Visions of the blinded
Buried beneath
Surface of ill-minded
