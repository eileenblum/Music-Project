So you think
You'we got it all figured out
Are you sure!

Piece of heaven
Everyday dream
Shine on! Shine on!

White picket fence
Freshly fuck'd bride moans inside
Hand's of the postman!

So your lazy effort
To cope with this life
Useless's tool what you are

Twisted red
Mesmerizing your heart
Fuck it and get high

No need for remission
For what I'we done
Never decline for a chance
