Violate,
Existing matter
In order
For all creation

Before
Construct of time
Mother of life
And death shrive

Spiraling down
Consume to contaminate
It's not the end, of the cycle

Delusion
That we are bind
Comforting silence, surround

One with the fire
Rebirth of knowledge
Dark matter collides
Dance of Shiva

Delusion
Our sense's fail
Behind the shade's
Destruction remains

Through unknown
We all shall go
(is there) darkness in the grace?

One with the fire
Rebirth of life
Dark matter collides
In dance of Shiva

Infinite cycle
We return
