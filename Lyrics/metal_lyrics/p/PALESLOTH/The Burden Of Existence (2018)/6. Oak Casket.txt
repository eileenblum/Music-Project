Would you guide me
If I lose my way

Embrace the void

Beauty of the sea
Held in cold air and despair

An oath by blood

High sails
Straight line
Forward
Oak casket

High sails
Straight line
Forward
Mary Celest

Countless times
Sun has sunken into the sea

Embrace the void

Sickness among us
Price of our greed

Line's getting shorter

High sails
Straight line
Forward
Oak casket

High sails
Straight line
Forward to the death

Mary Celest

Death of the wind
Storm inside
Of the motionless sea
Attraction to fall
Through the mirror of sky
And beyond

Swallowâ¦
Breatheâ¦

Attractionâ¦
To fallâ¦
