Cut the head
Slithering snake
Never forget
Where you came from

Crawl under
Tear up the skin
Deception
Marrow of love

Burn it down
Devour our remains
Reclaim the vengeance

Beast's among us
Rotten ground
Silver tongue
Blood remains

The golden heart's
Crushing the spirit
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
