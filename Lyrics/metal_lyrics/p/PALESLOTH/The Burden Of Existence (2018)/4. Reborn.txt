Cursed to wonder
Slaves of our time
Endless search for
Sense for our cause

First sight burns my eyes
White flash distant light
Memories from the past life

One of my own
No need for shine and glow
Safe in deep silence
Feels more like home
Now more than ever
I maintain everything but control

Glad I don't know
Road's to contempt
Heavy as thousand stones
Feather light step
