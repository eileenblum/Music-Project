Beyond the skyline black stars are rising
Death of light in city of silence

Insight of absence in dim Carcosa
Heart of the mountain
Nine is divided

For what we lose is what we live for
Among the shadows you get what you deserve

Silent voices struggle to be heard
Eyes sewn shut for those who seek

Sinister mist where kings lay to die
Red and white is here aligned

Request denied for absolution
Inside the nine no place to hide

Abandon all hope you who enter here
Among the lost
Forever
And ever
