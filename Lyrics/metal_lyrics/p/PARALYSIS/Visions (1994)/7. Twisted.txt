Twisted...

Feel the sharp point of steel
Break the skin
Pearce into dark blue vain
Enters exposing body
Taste of sweat, feel the surge
Rush through blood
Out of control, opens the mind
Forced soul experience...

No way out intensity
Beneath the flesh
Mind leaves body
A moving journey through endlessness
Released Inside
Escaped reality, zones of fiction
Twist and claw, the face, the fall
Downwards motion misery...

[Chorus:]
Twisted beyond all recognition
Twisted beyond all known belief
Twisted by the drugs addiction
Twisted, how many more must grief?
Twist, twist, twist... Twisted!
Twist, twist, twist... Twisted!
Twist, twist, twist... Twisted!
Twist, twist, twist... Twisted!

Float around come crashing donor
Thoughts dissolve
Discharge of shape, fear and hope
Ferocious color bright
Depressions, pain of sorrows past
Blind the sight
A choice was made, took a path
Darkness exchanged for light...

[Chorus]
