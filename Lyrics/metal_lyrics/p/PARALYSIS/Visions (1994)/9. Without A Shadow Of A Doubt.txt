Without... without a shadow of a doubt
Feelings still remain
Without a shadow of a doubt

Silence surrounds my every move
Lonely hours return to haunt me
Will I ever cast away this presence
That embraces, constricts my body
The endless void within my soul
Grows deeper day by day
Visions come unto me
Bearing witness of any faults
The mind is strong
But the flesh is weak
This has been proved time after time
Will I ever learn from my mistakes?

Seasons shall come, seasons shall go
Passing by without a whisper, without goodbye
And time will tell time beholds the answer
To all the questions that we ask

Without... without a shadow of a doubt
Feelings still remain
Without a shadow of a doubt

Can dreams and wishes become reality?
Memories twist and turn within my mind
The voice of conscience bears down on me (yeah!)
Regrets of chances, decisions made
Blind in emotion, bringer of sorrow
Broke a trust and splintered a heart
Brought so much pain to someone so precious
Wish I could change all whatâs happened
But forgiveness is such a difficult word (oh...!)
Only time can heal the wounds
So forget the past, leave it behind
Look to the future, there lies hope

Seasons shall come, seasons shall go
Passing by without a whisper, without goodbyes
And time will tell time, beholds the answer
To all the questions that we ask

Ask... Your... Self...

Without... without a shadow of a doubt... regrets

Without... without a shadow of a doubt
Feelings still remain
Without a shadow of a doubt

Feelings still remain...
Feelings still remain...

Doubt!
