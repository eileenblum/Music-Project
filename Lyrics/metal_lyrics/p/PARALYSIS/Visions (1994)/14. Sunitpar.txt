[Bonus Track]This songâs dedicated to a friend of ours
Who wears womenâs clothes and goes to gay bars
Oh sorry! Right person, wrong song... Letâs start again

Heâs small compact and not so pretty
Not a good dresser, itâs such a pity
But heâs got a heart, a heart of goad
Still heâs our roady when heâs a hundred years old

By the way thatâs next week
Heâs much older than he looks you know

He drives our bus to all our shows
Carries our gear wherever we go
Sometimes we forget to show appreciation
Our faithful roady, what dedication!

Heâs so dedicated in everything he does
He even irons his Y fronts, ask his mum!

Heâs a builder, a welder, a driver, a seller
Has strange little habits, but is a bloody nice fellow
Not just our roady, but heâs our friend
In spite of his snoring that drives us round the bend

Give us a T! (T!)
Give us an I! (I!)
Give us an N! (N!)
Give us a U! (U!)
Give us an S! (S!)

What does it spell backwards? SUNIT!

Tinus, we thank you
Itâs a funky sunit rap
(Until the end)
