I lost a friend today of many ages old
A great comfort to us all
Throughout our youthful years
Gave us guidance, taught us truth
Gave us treasures from so deep
Look at the âwayâ we have repaid her

And she cries
And she cries - she cries to me
Tears of sadness - tears of pain
And she cries - she cries to me
Tears they fall so desperately

I see it with my eyes
Colors changing day by day
Itâs not fiction slipping
Slowly fades away

[Chorus:]
Shades of grey
Fade to black
Darkness surrounds me
Shades of grey
Fade to black
Darkness engulfs me

I lost a friend today of many ages old
A great comfort to us all
Throughout our youthful years
Weâve shown no guidance
Weâve shown no truth
Lost all treasures from so deep
Look at the âwayâ we have repaid her

[Chorus]

And she cries
And she cries - she cries to me
Tears of sadness - tears of pain
And she cries - she cries to me
Tears they fall so desperately

Shades of grey...
Shades of grey...
