She comes from a home of instability
Shrouded by abuse and misery
Plays a game, a masquerade
Always running, always so... afraid
Admits to nothing
Committed no crimes
To be punished for the rest of her life
So afraid to face herself
So afraid to face the truth

Point... of no return [4x]

Run from the past
Run from the present
Run from the future
Escape the truth

[Chorus:]
A past buried deep within
Locked away inside her mind
Look at this false thing youâve become
Can you be true? Reveal yourself

Always running but you donât know from who
Insecure without feelings, without love
Misleading people into your web of deceit
Playing the innocent role

[Chorus]

Will you ever learn from mistakes youâve made?
Open up inside, let your feelings go
Stop the lies and deceitfulness
End the masquerade, close the show

Point... of no return [4x]

Run from the past
Run from the present
Run from the future
Escape the truth

Always running but you donât know from who
Insecure without feelings, without love
Misleading people into your web of deceit
Playing the innocent role

[Chorus 2x]
