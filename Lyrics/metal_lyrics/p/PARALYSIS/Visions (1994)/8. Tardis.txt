Far beyond our wisdom beyond distant horizons
Lie worlds forgotten, cast away in time
Pasts filled with lords, kings and rulers
Stories of ancient legends untold
What a sight that must have been to experience

How I wish I could have been there
Watching history evolve before my very own eyes
How I wish I could have the power
Changing all the wrong things to the right
To the right

Take a chance step into the time machine
Travel through ages, see things you wonât believe
Mysteries of past and present shall reveal
Enter a brand new age, a brand new day
Conquer new dimensions, seek out the truth
Awakening spirits from centuries passed on
Analyze past history where did we, where did we go wrong?
Millions of years gone by, times to change
Time to change our song
Time to change our song

Now I have arrived
Travelled backwards in time
Stand upon these ancient shores
Have the power, the control
Inside my mind what are my thoughts
To change for better or for worse
Inside my mind what are my thoughts
Has this all gone to my head?

[Chorus:]
How I have wished all of this time
Now I am here, the judgment is mine
How I have hoped all of this time
Now I am here, the power is mine
The power is mine, I have control
The power is mine, the power is mine!

Far beyond our wisdom beyond distant horizons
Lie worlds forgotten, cast away in time
Pasts filled with lords, kings and rulers
What a sight that must have been to experience

How I have wished all of this time
Now I am here, the judgment is mine
How I have hoped for wrong or for right
Now I am here, the choice is mine
For wrong or for right I have the choice
The power is mine!
