The evidence surrounds our every move
Destroyed our world, what have we proved
We are so blind that we canât see
Killing our planet, yes, you and me
Why have we let it come to this?
We must change and start working for the future

Can we still survive?
Have we reached the end?
Look at what weâve done
Only time will tell
Can we stop the clock?
Is our planet lost?
We have gone too far
Only time will tell

Aggression, destruction, all around us
Inhumane suffering, a continuing story
How long must this go on?
How long before this shall end?

Drastic progression...shift of balances
Altered states...mindless destruction

[Chorus:]
We are living in our filth
And we make it worse every day
We canât go on like this
We must change our ways of living

You have been tortured since time began
Have always taken it very well
Back then there was chance for recovery
Now itâs too late thatâs a long time ago

Can we still survive?
Have we reached the end?
Look at what weâve done
Only time will tell
Can we stop the clock?
Is our planet lost?
We have gone too far
Only time will tell

[Chorus 2x]

A leakage of a secret government report to the press today, revealed horrific details of a cover-up at several of our major nuclear powerplants throughout our country. The report showed that unacceptable levels of highly radio-active substances had been freely escaping into the atmosphere, over a period of six months. It was discovered that reports of these occurrences were somehow mysteriously lost in the computer network within the powerplantsâ system. Supervisors from the plant have been reprimanded and will be appearing before a tribunal later this week. However the question still remains, as to how safe we really are by placing so much trust in the hands of the so-called nuclear power experts.
