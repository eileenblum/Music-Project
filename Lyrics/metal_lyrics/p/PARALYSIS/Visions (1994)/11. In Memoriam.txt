Wheels on the war-machine
Shall always keep on turning
Warmongers making money
Will always keep on earning
As one battle comes to an end
Another oneâs just begun
The apocalypse it still remains
Goes on and on and on
When the lighting finally ceases hey!
Tell me who has really won

Manâs created this monster
Causing mass destruction worldwide
Taking millions of innocent lives each year
No safe place for them to hide
Lust for war has been in our blood
Since evolution this can he found
Our race evolves, learns, builds, creates
Conflicts smash it to the ground
Power greed thatâs on our minds
Weâve closed our eyes, we are so blind

[Chorus:]
When will we learn?
See all the wrong things that we do
When will we learn?
Then itâs too late for me and for you
Thatâs when weâll learn
Reaching our fatal final truth
Fatal final truth

When will we learn?
See all the wrong things that we do
When will we learn?
Then itâs too late for me and for you

Look back in time across the years
Nothing gained from the fighting and the tears
Whatâs been achieved, what does war bring
Refugees, pain, terror, suffering
When will we learn?... Never!

[Chorus]

Have we really listened to the moral of this song?
Continuing along these lines man wonât exist for long
Technology was for the future, supposed to be our friend
The only thing progress has brought is closer to the end
We will never ever learn, weâll self-destruct
Our fuse it burns

[Chorus]
