(Dedicated to two special friends)

Emptiness, the only thing I feel inside
Trying to recall if anything was real
Reflecting on past memories of times lost long ago
Prepare myself to greet the coldness I shall embrace
Help me escape from yesterday... yesterday

Sifting through the damage, my life shattered all around
No confidence or feelings, things just wonât work out
How can I bare inside the hurt I know is true
Explain to me, help me understand the reason why youâve gone
Left me alone, by myself... yesterday

Frightening so quiet, questions still surround
Waiting by that special place, gazing from my eyes
Searching for your presence but it cannot be found
I cried upon that night a when they called out your name
Took you away, Iâm so alone...

Escape from yesterday
Iâm so alone
Escape from yesterday
Took you away
Escape from yesterday
Iâm so alone... Iâm so alone
I wish I could leave yesterday
