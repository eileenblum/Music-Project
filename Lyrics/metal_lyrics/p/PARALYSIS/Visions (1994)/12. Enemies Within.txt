Who are we? Why are we here?
Is this fate or insanity?
Sometimes I lie awake at night
And think this all is a game

I am not ready for this world
Not ready to face humanity

We play our parts as the almighty watches
Our every move from birth till death
So carefully planned but among us so few
Who use this knowledge to rebel

I thought it was all for one not one for all
Cries from the silent who cannot speak
Tears shall be shed for now and forevermore
Are these our fears, our enemies within?

Illusions constantly surround searching for ourselves
Unable, sometimes impossible to find
But the search goes on and on and on
Seems so close but so far apart... so far apart... unreality

I ant not ready for this world
Not ready to face humanity

What have I done?
What have I seen?
What have I learnt?
Whatâs to become?

I thought it was all for one not one for all
Cries from the silent who cannot speak
Are these our fears, our enemies within?
