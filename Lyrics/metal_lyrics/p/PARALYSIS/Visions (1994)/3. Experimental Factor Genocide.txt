A chosen few true to their cause
Special group set up for research
Testing, planning accidental discoveries
Top secret files, no access, no limits
Fundamental basic laws of science

Found the key...exploring new fields
Facts or fiction...problems to solve
A scientific cause...laboratory madness
Is this the answer to it all...?

Experimental factor...
Experimental factor genocide
Scientific madness beyond control
Experimental factor genocide
For the knowledge sold their souls

[Chorus:]
Experimental factor...genocide
Experimental factor...genocide

A chosen few true to their cause
Special group set up for research
Testing, planning accidental discoveries
Top secret files, no access, no limits
Fundamental basic laws of science

Explored the new fields
Discovered new limits
Did you solve the problems?
Yes but new questions arise
Was the knowledge worth the price?
That we all must pay
Is this the answer to it all?
Is this the answer to it all?

[Chorus]
