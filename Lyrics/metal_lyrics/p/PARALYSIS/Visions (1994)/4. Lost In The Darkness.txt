I do not remember anything
Is this a dream or reality?
Blind fate has brought me to this place
An outcast of the human race
Inside the screams no one can hear
Torment, frustration, pain and fear
Doctorsâ reports say I am alive
Medical science prolongs my survive

[Chorus:]
Man or machine tell me who I am
Why must they keep me alive?
Man or machine whatâs the reason why
Give me peace of mind, please, release me, let me die

Man or machine... Am I man or machine?
Man or machine... Am I man or machine?

Hideous Iâve become a freak, a novelty
Ludicrous cries invested in me
Motionless inside my lean, you canât see
Helplessness, end my life, release me

Blind, deaf, dumb, canât communicate
Motionless, never to participate
Held in suspended animation
No care, no help, hopeless situation
Mindâs thoughts live, still exist
Just a statistic on a list
Cables tubes pump in the life
No analysis for the pain I feel inside

[Chorus 2x]

Man or machine... Am I man or machine?
Man or machine... Am I man or machine?

Trapped In this strange place...
No one can help me...
Canât find my way home...
From darkness to light...
Lost in the darkness...
Lost In the darkness...
Canât find my way home...
