[Recorded 1995]

Remove my eyes, so I can no longer see
See what's going on
Take away my heart, so I can't feel anymore
No passion, no love
At the end of the day, tell me what remains
At the end of the day when I'm stripped naked to the bone
At the end of the day what remains
When my spirits broken, shattered to pieces

Walked with you a while
Shared words of conversation
Looked deep into your eyes
Let all resistance slip away
Illusion, temptation, persuasion
Took me to places beyond my wildest dreams you said
Let me take you by the hand
Show you beauty, show you evil
Preservation, desire reaching out for you
Give me your hand I will take you to Wonderland
To Wonderland

Oh now, you have taken my soul
I have no morals left
No boundaries, no limits
You've taken my mind
Brainwashed me to nothing
No resistance, no restraint
At the end of the day, what remains
At the end of the day
When I'm stripped naked to the bone
At the end of the day tell me what remains
When my spirits broken, shattered to pieces
Shattered to pieces

To Wonderland

Wonderland is just a step away
If you let it rule your life
And your mind
