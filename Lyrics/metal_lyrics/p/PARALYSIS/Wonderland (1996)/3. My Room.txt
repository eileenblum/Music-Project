[Recorded 1994]

Watch the news worldwide on your TVs
Religions, wars, destruction for names sake
Politicians promise a world that is unreal
Greed, money, sex, influence play their part
Society has touched and twisted us all
Read the centre pages look through publicâs eye
The famous addicted psycho killers ruin free
Blind leading the blind along a path of discontent
Young generations brainwashed by systems gone wrong

Who am I...what have I become
Slave to my own addiction
An obsession but master to none
Obsession but master to none...

Voices tell me what to do
I hear the voices in my head
They tell me what I have to do
Play this game, a masquerade
Spread disease on all of you
Lust to kill to bring pain

Voices call me, guide me to my room
Who knows the reasons tell me why
I must commit these awful crimes
Inflicting love as you die
Sexual pleasure my delight
Another victim falls tonight
Voices call me, guide me to my room

Frustrations, emotions, sometimes bad or good
Problems, reasons, misplaced childhood
I live behind a mask, never use the same face twice
Enter my darkness, reality disappears

Every day you may see my face
As we pass upon the street
No one knows who I really am
One eye shall seldom meet
Madness concealed, locked deep within
Unnoticeable in the crowd
So many things I wish to say
But the voices do not, do not, do not allow...

Every day you may see my face
As we pass upon the street
No one knows who I really am
Our eyes shall seldom meet
Madness concealed locked deep within
Unnoticeable in the crowd
So many things I wish to say
But the voices do not allow
How can I ever break free

Voices whisper, tell me what to do
Voices whisper, call one to my room
Frustrations, emotions, sometimes bad or good
Problems, reasons, misplaced childhood
