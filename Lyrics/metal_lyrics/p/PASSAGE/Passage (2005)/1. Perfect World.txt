All birds fly in silence today
As if the end of all is near
Grass so lifeless, the trees are dying fast
Pain is present, in this perfect world
Take my hand, we'll walk together
To wash away the tears, to push away your pain
Dreams are over, void fills my heart

And I like trying to prove you
That hope can't be forgotten
That love can erase the truth
Nothing will be broken
And it killed me when I found you
On your bed, in your own blood
That night I really lost myself
The only glimmer that still was

We live in a perfect world
I ever thought we could live in a different world
But I believe, I'm still living in your dreams
Now it's time for me to run away
My dreaming mind, will never be the same again
But a candle will burn eternally
