Darkness again, darkness forever
Ice, cold
No! The sun has turned to black
No! My heart is black

Doomy landscape of frozen pride
Your river is so cold ...
I forgot your visage so pure
When you fell ...

Would you blame my sympathy ?
Would you seek my misery ?
Neverending scorn for that glance
My candle has been blown up

Darkness again, darkness forever
My heart is black, black forever
I will agonize in everlasting dreams
Until eternity will end ...
