Do you hope for something more?
More than what you see around you
Don't let your last dream die in you
I'm the one who want to laugh with you!
I see the tears falling from your eyes
And the darkness inside your soul
But do you still know there is only a little chance
For me to get a grip in life again
My dear, I think we're the last prisoners
Of time that is running out
If there's only a small piece of a dream
For me to believe it will come true

And for the last time in my life
I'll look outside through my window
What I see is you trying to go away
Please, please I want you to stay!
Stay with me and die with me
I know joy is elsewhere than here
I know joy is in death

Please stay, I'll change my way of life
Please stay, I'll change my destiny

In my last broken dream
You were there with me
