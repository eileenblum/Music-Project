Saying sorry
With all these excuses
Is another stab in my flesh
You told me not to come
So I should better take my own way

Our dreams became nightmares
In time of a fingers clap
Fire dies inside of me
The voice of reason is calling
Why are you so wicked?
You lied to me since the first time
Why are you so wicked?

Our dreams of joy where are they?
Drowned inside your sorrow?
They kept our flame alive

I tried but now it's gone
It is (only) a murmur in the wind
Your mind is hard to understand
(We should) leave our souls alone

Please stop this now
Cause it's gone too far,
It's gone too far
If the world is nothing more than this
I'd better kill myself right away
