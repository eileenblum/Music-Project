Darkness within
Feeble light

See through my eyes
All the shame I have inside
How sorry I am
So much tears because of me

My cold winter pain
Has kept me away from your soul
A sombre smile of innocence
Is lost forever in the snow

I was the one who tried to feel warmth again
You were the one who made me believe again
Remember the hours passed with passion
You (only) remember your darkest sorrow

Prey for life again
Just a little sign of faith
To believe the truth in me

Give me a grip in life again
Let me see the sun one last time
Forget the past, it's only pale souvenirs
Filled with tears and shameful darkness
