Why? Only tell me why
And I'll forgive you one day
Why did you left me alone
When I passed away
No angels came to welcome me
I was afraid
I saw no white lights we were told
No warmth, nothing
However I knew I left the earth
My skin was cold and lifeless
I couldn't say any last words
Cause I was alone and not in peace

Why? Only tell me why
And I'll forgive you one day
You never let me the chance
To prove you that love was not dead
Even in the end, when all was gloomy and dark
When I was very feeble but still alive
I knew that somewhere, love existed
Without tears and intense suffering
I'm hoping desperately now
That my new world will be better
I hope that I'll be alright

I miss the time passed with you, with everyone
The good times now very far away
Everything is so sad here

Why? Only tell me why
And I'll forgive you one day
Why are you crying now that I'm gone?
Are you really sad, or rather hypocrite?
My coma was long and hard
I couldn't stand it anymore
Without no one goodbyes it was like death already
It is death already

Goodbye
