I wish I could be a shadow
To challenge the world myself alone
And then avoid my memory
(To) come back in a time when there was light
On me
Can you believe it is possible
To dream without never be awakened?
Dream eternally in peace
A burden too heavy to support
A secret too big to keep
Forget my name, my face
I have never existed

I watch the stars and hope
That this burden will disappear
But I know it will never be gone
Cause sorrow is my life
Forget all about me
I have never lived at all

Abandoned, wasted
Hurt me again as a final answer
I'll drive away to nowhere
The only place where my soul can survive
Damnation
