Everyone turning their backs on me
I become a very close man
With a soul deeper than infinity
Darker than your heart
I wander through this night
Alone like never before
I've lost everything, forever

In this cold autumn night
I cannot erase my memory
It seems like all days look the same
For me, the end is near
Sorrow took all over my life
I've never been able to breath again
Since our world collapsed
You killed me with your lies

Could I trust you again?
In a warm and sincere manner?
But I'm old now
Everything has been so rough

I disappear from your world now dead
It means nothing more to me
Nothing but the worst you could imagine

Now I can't trust again
Never try to solace me
An echo beyond the walls
Of a prison deeper than infinity
