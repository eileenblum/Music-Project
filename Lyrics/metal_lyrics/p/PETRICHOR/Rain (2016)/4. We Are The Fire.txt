Turn over the altar
Cast the crosses out
A ceremonial cremation
For the devout

Your insipid children
The smoke will fill their lungs
We'll reclaim the past
By tearing out their tongues.

O great redeemer!
We call the flame
Payback the shepherd
For millennia of pain
We are the fire
We'll burn you down
Turn churches to cinders
Kick the ashes to the ground

Their cursed temples
Made of stolen wood
They raped our forests
And disrespect our gods

Your churches lay aflame and in ruin
Your bastard Nazarene in the mud
The price for slaughtering pagans
Will be paid in Christian blood

O great redeemer!
We call the flame
Payback the shepherd
For millennia of pain
We are the fire
We'll burn you down
Turn churches to cinders
Kick the ashes to the ground

Nothing Burns
Nothing Burns
Nothing Burns
Quite like a bible burns

O great redeemer
We call the flame
Payback the shepherd
For millennia of pain
We are the fire
We'll burn you down
Turn churches to cinders
Kick the ashes to the ground
