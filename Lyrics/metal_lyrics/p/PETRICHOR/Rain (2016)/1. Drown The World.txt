Bring me the stormâ¯
Wash us cleanâ¯
Bring me warâ¯
Bring me screamsâ¯
Bring me the rainâ¯
Drown the worldâ¯
Petrichorâ¯
Make us cleanâ¯

I'm in love with the rain
The way it feels on my skin
How it smothers the streets
The way it washes us clean
And I know deep in my heart
I want to see the world choke
Between the tempest above
And rising waters below

Rend the seasâ¯
Drag us downâ¯
Rip the clothâ¯
We will drownâ¯
Fill your lungsâ¯
With deathâ¯
Claw your eyesâ¯
Stolen breathâ¯
Your god has abandoned youâ¯
No angels will come for youâ¯

Endless nightâ¯
Dark skiesâ¯
Quench the sunâ¯
Crush the lightâ¯
I will watch you dieâ¯
I will see you scratched out from this lifeâ¯

I see clouds on your horizonâ¯
Black clouds, no silver liningâ¯
The world drowns with meâ¯

I smell dirt after rain
Total absence of pain
taste of blood in your mouth
Water in. Water out.

Endlessly flowing riversâ¯
Condemn this world to die
Ravens leave home forever
And circle in the sky

I will drag your bloated corpseâ¯
To hell with meâ¯
As the light above you fadesâ¯

Your god is dead
I know. He drowned.
Your old world washed away
The new king in black is crowned

Drown the worldâ¯
Drown the worldâ¯
Drown the worldâ¯
Drown the world
