When you lose faith in everything,
You are capable of anything
Nothing can be known
Except that we can never know

Reality is just a construct
And all your gods are dead
I buried them myself
With the books above my bed

No masters
No loyalty
No gods - only beasts
No faith
No life
Just destruction - nihilists rise

The scales fall from our eyes
So finally we see
Your gods turned away, long ago
Shame on them. Shame on me.

Morality is a construct
An ivory shroud to wear
And I don't care
I don't care

No masters
No loyalty
No gods - only beasts
No faith
No life
Just destruction - nihilists rise

A stillness like death,
In which everything is forlorn
A grey line in a sunset
The ever-approaching storm
Obsessed with our destruction
We try to make it mean
And spend our twilight hours
On what might have been
Rise, nihilists rise
Tear the veil that covers your eyes
Stand on the cliff's edge
And bravely, face the sunset
Rise, nihilists rise
Tear the veil that covers your eyes
Stand on the cliff's edge
And bravely, face the sunset
