Unspoken utterance at the back of your throat.
A braid of lilies that becomes a noose
You dream to contract the human curse
A demonic presence to grow inside of you
This cannot be, this too must die
Words I cannot speak to you

So here we are again my love
At the precipice of choice and change
Reflecting on the roads we took
To be here, cold, alone and in pain
This cannot be, this too must die
Words I cannot speak to you

This cannot be
This must die
This cannot be
This too must die

Yes we have lost so many friends
To the traps of a painful life
Along the way they lost themselves
United by our grief, we cry
This cannot be, this too must die
Words I cannot speak to you

This cannot be
This must die
This cannot be
This too must die
