When summer lays down
Her breath heavy, breast heaving
Sickly and scoured
By the chill of the evening
Her children once green
Now withered and weaker
Enter young Autumn
Our entropic reaper

From the fire
Of the day
Came the march
Of decay
In the twilight
Of the years
Winter
Winter
Is here

As the dark steals the light
Unleash the waves of frost
All that was good as died
Absolute holocaust

From the fire
Of the day
Came the march
Of decay
In the twilight
Of the years
Winter
Winter
Is here

Die
