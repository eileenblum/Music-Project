Lying on a distant hill
Watching the night
Watching our universes
Fifty billion lights

Space,
The Final Frontier

An infinite life force
I can't comprehend
Perpetual thoughts
With no universal end

Space,
Final Frontier
Call out to no one

You know there's something out there
Something you can feel
Something you can't see at night
But you know inside it's real
