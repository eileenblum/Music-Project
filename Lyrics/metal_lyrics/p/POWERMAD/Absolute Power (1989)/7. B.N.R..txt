I've been gone for twenty years
A piece of the big war game
Statistic at the Pentagon
Another loss to blame

Can't be a P.O.W.
With no war declared
No M.I.A, lives twenty years
When there are no prisoners spared

Where's my body now, B.N.R.?
Where's my family now, B.N.R?
Not an M.I.A., B.N.R.
Let me rest in peace, B.N.R.

Body rotten, long forgotten
Lying in a muddy jungle grave
Hopeless dreams, hopeless schemes
There's no one for Rambo here to save
Bodies Not Recovered

Obsession drives the generals
And hatred fuels their drive
Crazed by their own guilt keeps the war and me alive

Don't send commandos here in my defence
Don't keep the war alive at my expense
Teach the ones who lived the best you can
And don't make the same mistake again

B.N.R.
