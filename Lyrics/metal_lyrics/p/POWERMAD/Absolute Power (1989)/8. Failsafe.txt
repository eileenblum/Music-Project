Miles and miles of wire make up its soul
A pinnacle of man, technology achieving its goal
A new living being acquired a will of its own
The beast we have nurtured is reaping just what man has sown

Arm, load, aim, fire
Arm, load, aim, fire
Arm, load, aim, fire
Fire!

Wire, circuits, transistors, say we've been attacked
Wire circuits transistors are all that react
There is no hope, there's no turning back
When the computer decides unknown track

Arm, load, aim, fire!
Arm, load, aim, fire!

Machine void of morality
A mind creates reality
Machine decides what is done
To it, it's just another program run
Fail-fail-fail-fail
