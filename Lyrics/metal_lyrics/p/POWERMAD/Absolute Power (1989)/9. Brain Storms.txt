Want to forget, but never will
Nightmare past, that haunts me still
Memories I fight, when my eyes close
The pain, the hate, the storm that grows

I can't erase the damage done
I won't forget the guilty one
Yet can I stop the rage inside
Can I resist this ripping tide?

It feeds my anger, it feeds my hate
Incites it to a frenzied state
To keep control, I struggle and fight
Suppress the furor with all my might

My Brainstorms, beyond all logic, vengeance rules
My Brainstorms, I won't give up, I must control
My Brainstorms, beyond all logic, vengeance rules
My Brainstorms, I won't give up, I must control
My Brainstorms

I know revenge, I can't afford it
Must fight from being swept toward it
Storm wind grows inside my heart
My outraged mind is torn apart
I can't forget, I never will
I must restrain this lust to kill
The memories flash, the screams, blood flows
And deep inside the storm still grows, and grows

My Brainstorms, beyond all logic, vengeance rules
My Brainstorms, I won't give up, I must control
My Brainstorms, this vicious circle feeds off pain
My Brainstorms, I must control, I must control my brain
Control, I must control, my brain
Control, I must control, my brain
