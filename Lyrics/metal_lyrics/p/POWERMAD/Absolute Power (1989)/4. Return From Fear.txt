World is changing, rearranging
The weak are left behind
Fear itself, the only fear
Still that is in your mind

Sickening state of greed and hate
Our world is gone astray
Their right is wrong, they don't belong
They just will have their day

No more fears, avenge the years
Its wisdom can't be bought
We must return, we must relearn
Wise lessons we've forgot

Past stagnation, intimidation
The time for fear is gone
The strong must rise with fearless eyes
It's time to carry on

World is changing
Rearranging
World is changing
Rearranging
