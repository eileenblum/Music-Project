Two nights ago they came from hell
Inventing lies that made my cell
World of deceit has raped my soul
For 19 years I've paid the toll

Seek out these people and together
Armed with flames of truth forever
We melt the plastic people down
Then we melt their Plastic Town

The flame that sheared my bars asunder
It left no time to think or wonder
It seeks out those with plastic hearts
And rips their plastic world apart

Nineteen years ago I came
Into a world that knows no shame
Snatched me from my rightful place
Revenge is mine, I'll leave no trace
