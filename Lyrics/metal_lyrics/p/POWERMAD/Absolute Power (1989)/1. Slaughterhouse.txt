Caught by justice, killed a criminal
Self-defense, your plan
Tried to honor, could not obey
Time to feel their wrath

Put in prison, set on Death Row
Awaiting hell's black door
Pondering death, wishing for life
You will feel no more

Ripping and tearing
Into your flesh
Feeling the needles from hell
Strapped in the chair
Hood over your head
Sniffing no cyanide smell
Struggle and struggle
There is nowhere to turn
Bowing your head for the kill
Tasting your life as it slips by
If you don't, the Slaughterhouse will

Slaughterhouse

Can you see me, I'm invisible
Can you feel my wrath
I can conquer, I can hold you
In the Slaughterhouse

House, Slaughterhouse
