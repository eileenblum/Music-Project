Territories, ripe for the picking 
A sovereign people in decline 
Puppets dance while people die 
and men in their Towers look away 

Categories, dying conditions 
Death and Hatred to Mankind 
The "truth" is always, your imposition 
Men in the desert left to fry 

You can't find a doorway 
when you're terrified 
even if the bloodstains aren't your own 

Ashamed to show your face but 
you want your piece of this place 
surviving in your head 
Immigrant; by a thread 

Erecting walls, now build a doorway 
To bring your Tired and your Poor 
Our own diversity, we roar in unity 
and we young patriots are pure 

You can't find a doorway
when you're terrified 
even if the blood aren't your own 

Ashamed to show your face but, 
you want your piece of this place 
surviving in your head 
Immigrant; by a thread
