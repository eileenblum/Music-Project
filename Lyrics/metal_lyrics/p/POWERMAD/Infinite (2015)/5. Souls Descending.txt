All the rage is gone
Apathetic thoughts

Slowly descending to what I'm defending
The outcome is dire, my feet to the fire

In vain I decide to pull ahead
Living to die, and soon I'll be dead
Slowly descend into life's bitter ending
Inside my fire, it fuels my desire

Souls are now descending
Minds are black and bending
Souls are now descending
Minds are black and bending

Lost in my own mind
Dead is my future kind
Slowly descending to my fatal end
No more desire, my will in the mire

Souls are now descending
Minds are black and bending
Souls are now descending
Minds are black and bending
