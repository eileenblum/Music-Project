When the circle starts to form, 
a unity of black is born 
disconnected from myself, 
my constitution screams for help 

Reconnect me, make life clear 
numbness now replaces fear 
attempt to rise brings scream of pain 
and my day of demons begins again 

Walking in this white and grey, 
I can't feel or concentrate 
crying out but silent, still 
zombified by little pills 

Faces that once recognized, 
Me, my soul, my dying eyes 
now contort with despair 
'til I am just a shell of fear 

When the circle is reborn, 
the contents of my life are torn 
lift me out and set me free 
erase the black that burdens me
