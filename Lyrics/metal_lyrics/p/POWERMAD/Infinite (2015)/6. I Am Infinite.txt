Barren-cold and endless time
Out of reach for those denying
That we just might not be here alone

Space will form and break apart
No matter where it ends or starts
Just deeper and expanding
Endlessly

Water through the firmament
Separating lights and comets
Onward through the colored gas of time

Space will form and break apart
No matter where it ends or starts
Just deeper and expanding endlessly

I am infinite

Barren-cold and endless time
Out of reach for those denying
That we just might not be here alone

Lest we never realize
The life that almost surely lies
Beyond the grasp of our
Mortality

Water through the hearts of men
Always searching, nearly drowning
Onward through the colored gas of time

Space will form and break apart
No matter where it ends or starts
Just deeper and expanding endlessly

I am infinite
I am infinite
