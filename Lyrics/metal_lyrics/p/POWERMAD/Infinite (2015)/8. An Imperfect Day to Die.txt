(as I)
Walk through the cold
There is death to behold
Shadows of monsters,
Of fear and oppression

Left on your own,
You'll be burned; flesh and bone.
At last you can see it,
And warm to be near it

(it's an imperfect day to die)

Walk through the cold
There is death to behold

(it's an imperfect day to die)

Shadows of monsters,
Of fear and depression

(it's an imperfect day to die)

Left on your own,
You'll be burned; flesh and bone.

(it's an imperfect day to die)

At last you can see it,
You want to be near it

(it's an imperfect day)

Silent eyes, without lies
Will I see you again when I open my eyes?
