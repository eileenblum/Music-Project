Blow a hole inside your mind
Bury deep the scars you hide
Seal it with laughs and smiles

Wander through this wicked world
Gathering your pain in pearls
Of silence

Tortured days that never come
With simple endings, or like some
That just end

It's a pity you won't let it in
For you are not a broken man

Right now, the Earth is turning without you
There's only time for us to free ourselves

Painful are the dreams you've saved,
They keep you reaching for the grave
Terrified there'll be a day, when you will not
Be shown the way,
And there will be a day

Leave this future for the past,
Living lies that never last
Let the future, let the future come!
You are what has always been
And part of what will never end

Right now, the Earth is turning without you
There's only time for us to free ourselves
