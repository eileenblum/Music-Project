World-wide disaster
With barely a man alive
His sword of decision
Buries the un-crucified

He flies through the forest,
Over ocean, desert and sea
No matter his hatred
With Odin inside him, he's free

Uncommon wars, build us a son
To destroy the world, an army of one

Uncommon wars, build us a son
To destroy the world, an army of one

Uncommon wars, build us a son
To destroy the world, an army of one
