Look at me, my life has been defiled
My life of dreams and will of steel is dying

A clouded heart and tempered will
Cannot feel the blood you spill
It's bringing me down
All the lives you soil and waste
Cannot feel the blood you taste
You're bringing me down

I know this enemy can't possibly turn inside
There's no more taking from my heart,

Degenerate, articulate that chaos
When you see my noble try
To bring my own death

Look at you, and free your silent child
Sullen wings that scream at your denial
Force your fate, and you'll never escape
You're pushing me, and pushing me and pushing me...

Down

I know this enemy can't possibly turn inside
There's no more taking from my heart,

Degenerate, articulate that chaos
When you see my...

But I know... when evil dies, you'll die.
