Running through
the darkened forest of my mind 
Murdered faces burned on every tree 
Silent screams 
from broken dreams so loud with pain 
Gotta find a doorway back to me 

Burn it down 
before the torment breaks you 
Burn it down 
before the violence takes you 

Flying through, 
I chase the demons from my mind, 
die but then they rise again in me, 
apologies are gone from me 
so leave this place 
and burn the Forest for the Human race 

Burn it down 
before the torment takes you 
Burn it down 
before the violence breaks you 

Running through 
the final forest of my mind 
Medicated, nebulous and free 
apologies are gone from me 
they're gone - from me, 
and I'll never find that doorway back to me 

Burn it down - slowly dim the light of Angels 

Burn it down... 

Burn it down - slowly dim the light of Angels 

When I hear you laughing in my head, 
the silence screams so loud
