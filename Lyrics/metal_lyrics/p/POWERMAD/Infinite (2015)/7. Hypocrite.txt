Poison and turmoil
No blood for "war" oil,
Flooding, and death and despair

Warming and changes
Destroying the pages of truth
From a hypocrite's chair

You should feel the shame,
The shame of suicide in your name

You say I must change my life
Or face "imminent strife"
While you're taxing the same power grid,
But you're no different fool
And we won't follow you
While you burn the same things you forbid

Where's the shame in your dead conscience?
Now where's the shaming?

Where's the shame in your dead conscience?
Now where's the shame?

Poison and turmoil
No blood for "war" oil,
Flooding, and death and despair

Warming and changes
Destroying the pages of truth
From a hypocrite's chair
