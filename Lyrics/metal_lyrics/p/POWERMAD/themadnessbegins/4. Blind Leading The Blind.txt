[Lyrics are by Bill Hill]

Born in a wasteland of concrete and steel
Taught how to react but not how to feel
Cant find the answers to questions inside
Lost and confused and in need of a guide

Not knowing truth in the things that I hear
Praying some hope will just magically appear
Commercial religion, with saviors to sell?
Bribe you with heaven and threatened with hell

Sheisters and charlatans are stealing our sight
Con men and leaches are sucking you dry
World politicians are twisting the knife
TV evangelists are running our lives

Blind men are leading the blind

Your hands are tied by the fat politicians
Grinding you down into abject submission
Your vote means nothing, it doesnât mean trash
It doesn't mean shit if its not backed by cash

Communist and capitalist, what does it matter
The poor just get poorer and the rich just get fatter
Corrupt world leaders are building their tower
Cracking the whip while the mute masses cower

Sheisters and charlatans are stealing our sight
Con men and leaches are sucking you dry
World politicians are twisting the knife
TV evangelists are running our lives
Blind men are leading the blind
Blind men are leading the blind

Dangling the key to the heavens door
Amassing the riches of the sickly and poor
Taking more money than theyâll ever need
Reaping the harvest with God given right

Apocalypse coming but they donât know when
Theyâll try and make one as soon as they can
Dealing with problems that donât spare the rod
Nuclear arsenals, man's gift from God

Sheisters and charlatans are stealing our sight
Con men and leaches are sucking you dry
World politicians are twisting the knife
TV evangelists are running our lives

Blind men are leading the blind
