Dare to embrace this wrongful healing
I've tried to change cause life has it's ways
Bent with I'm bent with this feeling thoughts start to
drain me bury the reasons why
Restless my mind seems so restless torn from the strain
confused and deranged
Sick with I'm sick from this pleading reflection's weight
with great frustration

Trapped inside myself
Caught again, ,never ending
Please take this all away

Countless attempts to push forward
Hell lives within me death seems to haunt me
Fear of losing this handle
I'll always hate this I'll never shake this cursed
