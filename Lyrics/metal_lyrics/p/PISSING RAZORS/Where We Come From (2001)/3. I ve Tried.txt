Sometimes I ask myself why my thoughts are so insecure
These people who love will elave me and drain me until I'm un-pure
I try to hold onto my thoughts buried in the past
But they come back and haunt me they pick at my brain
Peeling back all the wounds exposed

I've tried-to put these past me
I've tried-ignored all the facts
I've tried-inject fuel in my veins
I've tried-this truce will not stand

I search and I look for excuses reasons just to see your face
These feelings we had for each other have vanished without a trace
One day we'll meet again when my conscience is clean of the filth
Accusation made me this devil inside me it grips me and won't let me go

Denied-the chance to say sorry
Denied-the love that I give
Denied-combust fuel in my veins
Denied-mutual feelings are gone
