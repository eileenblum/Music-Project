To do to die to live to cry
Is there a reason why I have to die?
To know the pain is to go insane
A free man I once was I live with the guilt that is not my own

My cries for life all go in vain
I'm caught in the system of no remorse
Dead in the eyes of my peers
Now my life will not end in years
Only to really be denied

[chorus]
Life.... Does anyone care for my life?
Denied.... Justice is served but denied
Die.... In due time you will die
Truth.... Only then you will know the truth

To do to die to live to cry
Is there a reason why I have to die?
To know the pain is to go insane
A free man I once was I live with the guild that is not my own
