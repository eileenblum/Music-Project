Hold on strong never fear their void
Never fear their void
Been denied for so long
All my faith keeps true pace
You all said that I would soon fail
But I always knew where I belonged
Keep to myself

[chorus]
Now you want to hear me
I hear you want to sense me
Since you want to know me
I know you want to regret me

Eyes of life vision strength
Now complete, what's it like to feed on beliefs
Cause when I look in your eyes now I know why I
Keep to myself
Keep to myself

[chorus]

Keep to myself
Keep to myself
