Loss...I so badly want you to feel
Pain...the lack there of is so unfair
Blind...vengeful thoughts consume inside
Hate...I never knew I could hate this way
Rage...so for real I could kill you myself
Die...for you to die is what keeps me alive
Fear...the fear that you feel is very for real
Why...can't I be the one behind the gun?

[chorus]
Justice is served why do I still feel all the rage, the
hate, ,the loss, the pain
All this whole time your death was to heal my rage,  my
hate my loss, my pain

Loss...I so badly want you to feel
Pain...the lack there of is so unfair
Blind...vengeful thoughts consume inside
Hate...I never knew I could hate this way

May you rest in un-peace and feel all the wrath the
wrath of Satan himself as your sould slowly burns and
burns and burns I wish I could be there to see it myself

Vengence is Mine

[chorus]

Vengeance is Mine
