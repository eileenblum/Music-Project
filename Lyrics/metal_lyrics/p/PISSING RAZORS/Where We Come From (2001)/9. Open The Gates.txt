Build me up with empty promise just to watch me fail
You'll keep this deep inside of you cause you never really knew me at all
Must I suffer through and through with all the doubt that fills this room
Drown the questions in my mind blind myself with endless time

You said you'd always be there you neglect the way I feel
Should I plunge into my dark hole is this what makes you heal
Lifeless heart which tears and pours
Reminded scarres can't you see I rip myself from you

[chorus]
Open the gates let Hell find a way
Open the gates let Hell find it's way

Underneath I can't escape the numbness spreads in me
Can you sense the end is so near?
When you take me to that blacked place
All my demons keep me locked beneath

Rip myself from you

I knew I'd slowly vanish between two worlds and here
Will you ever wonder when I'm dead and gone?
Fading light, close my eyes, I've been waiting, take me away
