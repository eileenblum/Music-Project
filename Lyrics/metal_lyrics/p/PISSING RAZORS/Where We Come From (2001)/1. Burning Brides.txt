The dreams are so real and the lies are so real
To be naive to the almight dollar
In our own minds could be our demise if we did not
believe in our mind and our power we see all the greed
and our progress denied
Our belief is Benin onto you
Faith within us adversity seen before
Now with the strength with our people we burn

[chorus]
Burning the bridges down
Burn them down to the ground

Do you believe in the death of a dream how could you
even allow it
We won't be denied by our own pride so leave us in peace
rather than war this war will be fought with hearts and
our minds you will not win so don't even try
Now this known so you leave us alone and all we can say
is we burn

[chorus]
