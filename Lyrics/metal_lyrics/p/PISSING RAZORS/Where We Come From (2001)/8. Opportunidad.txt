An open hand to an open heart
A new beginning to an ended start
A time for passion a time for lust
You challenge your lies with my trust
An endless battle to say the worst
My turn to get the last word in first
I've proven myself time and again
Your walls come crumbling down, down

[chorus]
Opportunidad I gave
Opportunidad you took away from
Opportunidad I gave
Opportunidad you took away from me
