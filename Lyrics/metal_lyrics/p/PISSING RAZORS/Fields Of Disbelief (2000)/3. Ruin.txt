I gave you my trust
You spread all the lies
Your evil tongue is social destruction
That is the form I despise
You hold yourself so discreet
Only the world you entice
Never seem to fathom
All the damage that you create

Ruin - ruin - ruin - ruin - yeah 

Your fingers do all the talking
All the lives that you destroy
Your mind has many problems
Just leave me the fuck alone
Modern day advances
Taken over by the weak
Self esteem diminished
Not always do you succeed

Anger - My trust - My hate
Anger - My trust - My hate 
taken over by the weak
