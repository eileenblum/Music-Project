Didn't think the day would come
December 20th the ties were cut
It doesn't matter where you are
Minutes and seconds robbing us blind
Your face and memory - carved into stone
One day we'll meet again
Believe in time you'll understand

Put to a brutal test
Adolescent at an early age
I feel your anger - family is torn apart
Endless suffering - condemn this evil
The comfort in this - oh fuckin' sweet revenge

I'm thinking - I'm dreaming - 
I'm thinking - I'm drowning

Without a warning - I severed the ties
Deep regret - done for the good
Circumstance you'll understand

Take a look in the mirror
What do you see?
One day questions answered
As time is passing by

Put to a brutal test
Adolescent at an early age
I feel your anger - family is torn apart
Endless suffering - condemn this evil
The comfort in this - oh fuckin' sweet revenge

I'm thinking - I'm dreaming - 
I'm thinking - I'm drowning
