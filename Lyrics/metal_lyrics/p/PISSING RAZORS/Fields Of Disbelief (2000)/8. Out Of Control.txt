Time and time the story goes
How quick and easy it can slip away
Survived it all for this long
Is it really worth all the pain?
I keep chasing a dream
Without any thought of what I leave behind
You struggle to keep it together
No compassion or respect is given

I can't get it down right
One way all the time
Out of control 
Too much to lose
All these thoughts implanted

Born to play the part from the start
This tragic cycle continues
I sense your backbone breaking
It's time to take a look at this fuckin' picture
I hold my fate and make the choice
Believe me I know what you're thinking
Less than perfect I know I am
You better believe I'm willing to make the change

I can't get it down right
One way all the time
Out of control
Too much to lose
All the thoughts implanted
