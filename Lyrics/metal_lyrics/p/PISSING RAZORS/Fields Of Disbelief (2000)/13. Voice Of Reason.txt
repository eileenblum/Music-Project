Low down - high tide
Come crashing down inside
We know - the way
Try to bring you up today
Needle drops without a stain
Never hurts to dig a vein
Only way to free your mind
Lying down the world is blind

Low down - high tide
Separate the weak from wise
We know - the way
Try to bring you up today
Never falling down again
Never showing what we've said
Only way to free your mind
Lying down the world is blind

Voices ring in my head
Telling me I'm far from dead
No one sees the burning life
No one knows it flows inside
