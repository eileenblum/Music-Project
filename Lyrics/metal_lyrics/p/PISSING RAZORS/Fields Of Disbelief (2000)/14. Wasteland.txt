In a lonesome wasteland
With a worried mind
Looking for some answers
Mankind left behind
A land laid out before me
hardened to the core
I wish that I could go back
to the place I was before
sometimes listening so loud and clear
Seems to fade away
I don't lie to look at you
please just stay away
My vision tends to fray so fast
I don't even care
Wasteland Wasteland
Double up cross in this wasteland 
Double up cross in this wasteland 
Double up cross in this wasteland
