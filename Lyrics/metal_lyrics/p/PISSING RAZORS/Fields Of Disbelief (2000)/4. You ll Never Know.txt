You never know if your friend - standing right next to you
Will see you in the following day
You'll never know if the family who loves you
Regret the things they wanted to say
You never know if your lifetime of existence
Will betray you in the blink of an eye
We'll never know the answer
And still the question remains - why must it take us?

I saw your life building up with promise
Your memory is all that is left
I tried to forget by covering up reality
In hopes that you were really somewhere else
We'll never know how much your life affected us
If today would have never come
We'll never know the answer
And still the question remains - why must it take us?

Yeah
I sense my brain collecting all the moments
Your face and your laughter roaming free
We tend to take everything for granted
You never know when it's gonna end
Your soul at rest - put yourself at peace
Cuz we'll see you in the following day
Your soul at rest - put yourself at peace
Cuz we'll see you in the following day - 
God rest your soul

You never know ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
