They can't trust your word
No way to believe the lies
The only one that hurts is you
Everyone sees addiction inside
I know your face - it makes me sick
I've heard your cry - I fail to understand
The pity you seek intensifies
The word is out - the word is out

One by one your victims fall
Can't remember when 
Can't forget them all
The only one that hurts is you
Everyone sees the sickness inside
I know your face - it makes me sick
I've heard your cry - I fail to understand
The pity you seek intensifies
The word is out - the word is selfish
