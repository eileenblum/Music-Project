Silver spoon in mouth 
Not by his own choice
Passion in his heart
Lives by family ways
Wished he could have changed
Now it's just too late
The choices that are made - how could he have known?
Regret in his heart

Yeah ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Lived it, loved it, left it, want it, gave it ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

To live the way I do 
Is not the way for most
To love the way I love
Is a fantasy to most
Ignorance to sacrifice
Is the common way to go
Everyone thinking - everyone saying
Gotta get it the easy way

Lived it, loved it, left it, want it, gave it ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Yeah ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
