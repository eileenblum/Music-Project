Standing on the devil's tower
Talking to the gods
Looking for an answer
To help me with my cause
Scorched by the blazing sun
Molded by the wind
Faced with no life just the pain
Listen to my future - tell me why I'm here

Condemned-Reject-Punishment ï¿½ï¿½

I leave it up to one man
Sometimes I don't believe
Awaiting on my punishment
Between the good and bad
I never meant to exonerate
The fact that you exist
The price now - I lay in state
Between heaven and hell

Condemned-Reject-Punishment ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

In between the good and bad ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

The sound of extinction
Ringing loud and clear
Appearance of no life
Disfigured to the end
