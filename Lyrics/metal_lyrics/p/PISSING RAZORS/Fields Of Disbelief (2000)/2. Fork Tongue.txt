Fork Tongue ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

He lost his mind every single day
No visitations while his eyes turned gray
No need for sorrow now he's laid to rest
The wounds will heal a new life begins
Yeah - your eyes tell a thousand stories
That no one wants to see
Your half blood through my body
Never meant a damn to me

You sat there for years and years
Insisted you cared but turned away
Right through the words of deceit and false promise
You really think I believe
If you could get it, you'd prove it today
Your cancer, no answer to God you must pray
But now he's gone I'm left to wonder
Only brothers and sisters remain

You sat there for years and years
Insisted you cared - but turned away
Why - must you ask for forgiveness?
Forgiveness is all you've received
Why - must you ask for forgiveness?
Our father's the one you've deceived
