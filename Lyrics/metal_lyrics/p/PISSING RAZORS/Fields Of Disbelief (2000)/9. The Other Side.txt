The book falls down begins its story
My life of living hell
Your eyes are red and glowing
Held captive by the feat

Enhance my curiosity
No escape the end is near
Trapped inside this dark room
Anxiety begins to boil
No power for light
No key to unlock
Never waking up - hands around my neck 
Prepare for my death

I can feel you coming closer
Your breath full of stench
Every movement etched in fear
You're slowly - taking over

Energy drained is energy taken
I don't recommend you play
Power given to this evil
A victim I have - forsaken

Let me go - This weight I want no longer
Let me go - Awaken from this trance
Let me go - Fear of my life
Let me go - Is this a dream or reality

Why! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
