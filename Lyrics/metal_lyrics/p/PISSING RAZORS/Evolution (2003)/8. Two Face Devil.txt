living in the depths of what you cant see before you
do what you need to succeed
stab and kill at will
rise inside and find i will be waiting
I want to kill you, I want to kill you

trusting you is like a disease
my fists will cure you
no sympathy as you live and breathe
you cant bring me down
die right now your time is running
this bind your burning, your soul is turning

your a two faced devil cant trust you
try to bring me down 
I hate you

dead you are in my eyes
my pain thoroughs 
truth behind your lies
consumes your innocent cries
run and hide, I will find you, I will deny you
