Take hold live and feel
the threshold, the will to build and restore
the dying old insane my role is lame
now the game is name your price
your soul pretends to stand the vise
lessons be learned, tis time to give in
the torture is cold, the threshold wins

suffering torturing

before you die again, make sure your life is sin
these blessings wont take away
the life your doomed today
the threshold wins again
expressions reveal your wounds
your visions are now entombed
deciding your fate is soon

hide forever pain
time is killing me
try to live again
dive to death my friend
this is the end, the end of your time
you had your turn, watch your live pass by
