I don't understand why
you could lose faith so soon
we will persevere through
feed the line twisted untrue
see and realize how high
be the existence to fly
climb the infinite unwind
how can you be so blind
to the things before you

perseverance is my way of life, i don't 
question my road when i see the light a light
once dim is now shining right, bright
enough to keep up the fight to give up now
is so absurd, we've come so far farther than
most lack of vision fucking open your eyes,
only then you will realize
