seeking redemption for loss in the past
defining my structure, my strength to surpass
something is taking over me
losing my sight, I cannot see

I'm gonna beat you down
if you dont turn away
I'm gonna take you back
and replace the first day

Instant aggression, this shade you know
cursed by appearance,
then the feelings will grow
something is taking over me
losing your sight you still can't see

this is haunting me, this cannot be
this is not me, just let it be

who gives a fuck
