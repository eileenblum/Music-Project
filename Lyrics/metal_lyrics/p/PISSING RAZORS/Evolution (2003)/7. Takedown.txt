another twisted end, shut out let me in take
down break within hold fast the deal begins
objection, rejection past off unvalued claim
deception, the morals name takedown

everything i've owned, you've lost
breaking every bone, you laugh
embarrassed by the tone, un rest
closing ties that fold, mistrust
since my brides been sold

I'm in the seat, what you want to be
grow with me feel free, I'm flying free
