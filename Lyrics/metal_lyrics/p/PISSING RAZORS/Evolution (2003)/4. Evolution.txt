Count on the blessings received
eluding past fate in deceit
as I breathe inside tomorrow

I've been waiting all these days, to capture the flight
riding up, i'm closing on these gates
victory is nearing our fate

can't you see me rise, you cant stop the climb
living sacrifice, so we've paid the price
Never, be your own enemy
Hold on, remain in yourself
always
