Trapped battled within
embrace the sin
on the brink of death, this is a war
fought in my mind
locked in my lonely cell

there's no way out
i've gone blind
can i scream

your broken back is playing me
living your live without a spine
cant breathe, wont live
without any voice

what's holding you back your killing me
blood in my eyes is turning black
