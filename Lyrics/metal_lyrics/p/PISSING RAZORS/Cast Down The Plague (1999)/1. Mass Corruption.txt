Corrupted by the promise of words
The hopeful lured by instinct unscathed
Suffering revealed innocence lost
opened the mind to illusions not gained

Subjected addicted to control
Stabbing backs to get your way
Strength is defense for the future and past
voice of a thousand soldiers- born to fight

Killed or be Killed that's what is taught
human guinea pig - greed that motivates
pissed off and confused - still they laugh
tools of the trade - product of mass corruption

The weak are ripped and torn away
Battered down nothing to say
Reflections of that mirrored stare
Heading in deep into the domination

You don't know what it's like
Enduring the pain of a senseless crime

Corrupted by the promise of words
The hopeful lured by instinct unscattered
Suffering revealed innocence lost
opened the mind to illusions not gained

The weak are ripped and torn away
Battered down nothing to say
Reflections of that mirrored stare
Heading in deep into the domination
Domination [X3]
