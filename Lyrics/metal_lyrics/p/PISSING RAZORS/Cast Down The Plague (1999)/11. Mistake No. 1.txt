Many times in my life
I've tried to end it all
To many problems to overcome
it was the easy way out
look into saddened eyes
because of certain death
I stop and start to wonder
why I tried to take my fucking life

Mistake number one

Took the weapon to my arms
My life is slowly fading
take me to salvation
I need your help to live
Reality proves me wrong
I'll never do it again
I understand why people hate me
I'll never preplan my death

Did I think it was the way
Suicide not the answer
So much life to look forward to
The truth remains to be seen
Realized Damage Done
Senses never gained
I stop and start to wonder
Why I tried to take my fucking life
