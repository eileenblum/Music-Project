Rage - overcome, let it bleed
Crazed - never stop only need
Hate - Slowly grows till it snaps
Pain - slipping thru then you crack

It breaks you down

Wrath - crushing down overwhelm
Scorn - Conquers you at the helm
Hurt - searching thru inner fear
Blame - self destruct slowly clear

it breaks you down
