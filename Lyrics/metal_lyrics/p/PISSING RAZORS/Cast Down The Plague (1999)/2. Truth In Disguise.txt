You realize and compromise
the ways of life
Your selfish lies
And true disguise
are ment for greed

Telling me we will survive
it's hard to believe
Confide before demise
And then you will see

Your truth in disguise [X2]

hide before your vision
of longevity
Face the consequence
of what is not real

Do you realize the sincerity
this life holds balance
You can't control me

Your truth in disguise [X2]

Everything is for yourself
you need not reveal
Disguise the truth - changing the deal
it's time to think twice
before you steal
two faced bastard
I will bring you down
