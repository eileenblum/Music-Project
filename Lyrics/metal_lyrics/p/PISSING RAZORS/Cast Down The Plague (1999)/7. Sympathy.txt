I had no fear
I just disappeared
I held no friends out
I just reappeared

Surving Devastation
Coping with the pain

Born to die for you
Given to the truth
inception of our friendship
it's what I hold so real

Surviving Devastation
Coping with the pain

Years go by so fast
with all the things I do hide
do you think you can carry out
with no disrespect in my mind
