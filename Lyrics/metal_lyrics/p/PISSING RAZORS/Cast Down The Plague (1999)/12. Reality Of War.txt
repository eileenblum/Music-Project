Death toll rises
A horrible vision in sight
fighting a war inside my head
for no apparent reason
Endless Killing
is a way of life
mentally scarred inside my brain
no time for healing

Don't fear me - never knowing if we survive
Don't fear me - never knowing if we will die
Don't fear me - Just to wonder if we go home
Don't fear me - man's fault they invented war

Reality of War [X3]
