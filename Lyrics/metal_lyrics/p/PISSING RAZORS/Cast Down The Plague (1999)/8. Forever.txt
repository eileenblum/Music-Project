Stop and take a look
Stop and Reminisce
About the time we both went thru
into the never

Never Again
the love lost
Respect desired

The time comes
to hurt yourself
to hurt one another
until the end

All for the better
As you fear the worst
So you go into
the never this time

it may be forever
the love lost
Maybe forever
