Understand in my hand lies a force you withstand
Understand in my hand hold the key to demise

Understand draw the line thoughts of you hold in mind
I will stand for what's real for all we are that you feel
Breakdown the Walls
Kept inside
Feed the pain
that you know
Understand
I am Real
Hypocrisy
I will Prevail
