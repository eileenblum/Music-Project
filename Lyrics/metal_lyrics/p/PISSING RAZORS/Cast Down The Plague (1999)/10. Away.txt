One month separation
Several lifelines of pain
haven't seen your eyes
cuz I haven't seen your
cuz I haven't seen your face

I feel you sleeping, I feel you sigh
I'am your father
it's tearing me apart inside

How could I have done this
I hope you can forgive
I'm living with the anguish
Maybe one day
Maybe one day you'll understand

I feel you breathing, I feel you cry
I'am your father
Your heart I carry with me inside

8 days remain
8 days of pain
I live with the anguish
my head retains strength

Feeling I have failed
So much I have to gain
Nothing could compare
to the life I put in
to the life I put in place
