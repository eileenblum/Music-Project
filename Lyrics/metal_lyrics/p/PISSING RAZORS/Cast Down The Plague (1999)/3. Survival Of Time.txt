One day - one night
it's all it took
to fuck my life
in the swipe of the blade
You feel the Rage, You feel the steel
it's what I live with for years &amp; years

Sink in the skin - don't know where it ends
it's do or die - I'd rather not die
taken a life - didn't have a choice
I pay the price with these fucken chains

I do my time live with the crime
Free at last to wonder just for how long
I a game over hate and lies
the people don't see me with their own eyes

A name on paper is what I'am
for the crime I committed years ago
Yesterday to them - here I'am once again
in a cage over hated and lies

You feel the rage - you feel the steel
it's what I live with for years and years
