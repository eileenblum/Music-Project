People ask for wellness ask for property and fame but what's the price that  they are willing to pay?
Trampling under foot all the human ways of life controlled by greed no thought of compromise
Go! Waste yourself to live just be the one you wanna be Waste yourself! The time will come for you to pay
Did you ever ask yourself why snakes have poisoned bites you turn around drown in an endless sleep
Is it just in nature is it instinct is it pride? give me an answer take a look inside
Hey you bastard, just come inside, let me lead you to your own sacrifice
Hey you bastard, just take your chance, the serpents waiting to begin a new romance
