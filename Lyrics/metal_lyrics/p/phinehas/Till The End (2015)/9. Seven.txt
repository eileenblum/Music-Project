I awoke in silence to broken glass
Blood stains the floor where I lay in separate halves
Trapped inside my mind my head welcomed the ground
Cursing in vain but my words offer no sound

I am lost in the spiral
My shame is stronger than desire for survival
An angel pushed me when I was pulling away
Despite my best attempts she decided to stay
Trapped in the cracks of an empty shell
On borrowed time that was spent in hell
The sum of all my fears strung out over seven long, long years

Drugs traverse my veins and leave me clutching the numb
My voice flies away further from my useless tongue
I sit quiet and still and hear worms eating the church
Maybe I believe them but Iâm drunk from drinking my words

I am lost in the spiral
My shame is stronger than desire for survival
An angel pushed me when I was pulling away
Despite my best attempts she decided to stay
Trapped in the cracks of an empty shell
On borrowed time that was spent in hell
The sum of all my fears strung out over seven long, long years

Speak the words tonight, span the void inside
Let loose the words youâre free, come back, come back to me
Speak the words tonight, span the void inside
Let loose the words youâre free, come back, come back to me

Seven years without a voice seven months away from my side
Seven spirals into the void but it ends now, it ends tonight

I wonât drag you down anymore
I am more than dead weight floating adrift
But I could never feel it brush my lips
You ask me to span the void inside
But I believe my borrowed timeâs run dry
I wonât drag your down anymore
Speak!

I wear my past as the scars on my feet
Seven years without a voice seven months away from my side
Seven spirals into the void but it ends now, it ends tonight
Seven years without a voice seven months away from my side
Seven spirals into the void but it ends now, it ends tonight
