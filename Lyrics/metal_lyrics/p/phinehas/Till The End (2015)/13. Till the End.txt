Till the end

To those freedom ensnared
A dying breed to the true heir
Resurrect and testify
I was born to live free or die
Why consult the grave about the breathing
When I feel your heart still beating
Itâs a counter intuitive love
You are not indentured servants to lust

This is not a prayer to be blessed
This is a prayer to be broken
I do not fear what they fear
Till the end Iâm singing

From shadows valley low we march into the mend
Through hollows I wonât stop singing till the end
From shadows valley low we march into the mend
Through hollows I wonât stop singing till the end

You were writhing in shackles
Tripping on plot holes
I can hear your voice begin to shake
You were birthing in my dreams
Hellâs newborn nightmare asleep

From shadows valley low we march into the mend
Through hollows I wonât stop singing till the end
From shadows valley low we march into the mend
Through hollows I wonât stop singing till the end

To those freedom ensnared
A dying breed to the true heir
Resurrect and testify
I was born to live free or die

Till the end
Live free or die
Till the end
Live free or die
Till the end
