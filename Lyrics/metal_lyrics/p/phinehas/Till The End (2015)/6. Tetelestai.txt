Oh how i long to see the end of every ending
To breathe before my last and begin beginning
Would you catch the wind with your arm
Or lift my oceans with a heave
All hell sound your sirens
Hold your breath for three words conceived:
It is finished
Walking down the streets i watch you turn your face from me
They ripped the skin from my back dissecting eternity
You clothed me in darkness given a rose but wearing the thorns instead
My last breath
I watch god hang his robes over the sun
To hide a child becoming corruption
Clean hands
Eternity nailed to a tree how tired you must have been
Clean hands
From a garden to misery bearing the weight of men
Yet you raise yourself higher to take your last breath
Demons pause with terror
I am blood enough to never run dry still you despise me
Sinking the spear in my side when you hung beside me on that day
Cursing at the wind will not stop the message i send

Clean hands
Eternity nailed to a tree how tired You must have been
Clean hands
From a garden to misery bearing the weight of men
Yet You raise yourself higher to take Your last breath

Bear witness once and for all
It is finished

Would you catch the wind with your arm
Or lift my oceans with a heave
All hell sound your sirens
Hold your breath for three words conceived
