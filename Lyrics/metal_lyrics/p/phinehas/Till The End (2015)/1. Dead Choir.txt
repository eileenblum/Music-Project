Dead choir
The moment i heard your footsteps shake upon the ground
It betrayed every hint of truth that fumbled out your mouth
The song you sang moved mountains silenced by fear
The unnerving complacency you wash down with your years

Dead choir
Does it help you sleep at night
Dead choir
To judge those youâve put out of sight
Youâre no man of faith
You are incapable of change
And youâve never been awake

Sing me a song not with empty words
But with feet that follow
Sing me a song so sweet to hear
But long since forgotten
Grace come my way
How can you love a god that you cannot see
When you hate your fellow man standing in front of me
When will you remember that love first made you sing
The words that jumped off the pages to comfort suffering

Dead choir
You think youâre serving someone else
Dead choir
But youâre only fooling yourself
Youâre no man of faith
Youâre a liar and a fake
You refuse to ever change
Without grace we would all be dead
We would all be dead
We would all be dead

Sing me a song not with empty words
But with feet that follow
Awaken a verse
Oh grace, come my way

Sing me a song not with empty words
But with feet that follow
Sing me a song so sweet to hear
But long since forgotten
Grace come my way
