Fate: What mere men define as the end
Fate: What Iâve seen as just the beginning
I am more than just a man
I walk in promise as an eternal soul
I am not afraid to die

I may bleed but my soul is well
I may fall but I will live to tell
If you should strike me down I return tenfold
I may be dressed in skin but itâs only a threshold

Oh, I was called the moment that you opened my eyes
To bring retribution to those who would steal your lives

I tip the scale of the world (I tip the scale of the world)
With the weight of all compassion on my back
I tip the scale of the world (I tip the scale of the world)
But itâs my burden to bear (burden to bear)
If you should strike me down, I return tenfold
I may be dressed in skin but itâs only a threshold

I may bleed but my soul is well
I may fall but I will live to tell
If you should strike me down I return tenfold
I may be dressed in skin but itâs only a threshold

I tip the scale of the world
I am more than just a man

I was called the moment that you opened my eyes
To bring retribution to those who would steal your lives
