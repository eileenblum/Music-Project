[feat. Dominic Dickinson]I trusted you with my life and you made it my hell

I would carve away at your skin to peel back your face
Searching for who you used to be if I knew it wasnât a waste

I trusted you with my life and you made it my hell
To the cold blooded deceiver
What do you have to say for yourself
To the cold blooded deceiver
I trusted you with my life and you made it my hell

Too white livered to even offer explanation
Betrayer and a thief
Too white livered to even offer explanation
You smeared poison in our sheets

Lying while lying in a wedding bed
You brought this into our home you played your games with my head
Deeper trace the wound across my neck
Deeper I was a promise you never kept

I trusted you with my life and you made it my hell
To the cold blooded deceiver
What do you have to say for yourself
To the cold blooded deceiver
I trusted you with my life and you made it my hell

Your skin is a casket because the man I once knew died
Next time you look in a mirror I hope your eyes go blind
I hope your eyes go blind
Next time you look in a mirror I hope your eyes go blind
I hope your eyes go blind
