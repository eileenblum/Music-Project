Teach me how to be brave in my last day
You grew up in a broken home and your mother said the porch was your bed
Manipulating your father into confinement
Just so they could cut the hairs from your head
They tried to steal your strength and beauty away
Forcing betrayal of a man i barely knew
Abandoned and thrown between white walls
But they could never, they will never break you
When they put the gun to your head
An angel stood between you and the trigger
When they said your breath was worth nothing
You made them listen to the voice of a leader
Teach me how to be brave in my last day
You awoke to empty hands so you worked them to the barest of bones
You were found knocked out with blood on the floor
But they could never, they will never break you

When they put the gun to your head
An angel stood between you and the trigger
When they said your breath was worth nothing
You made them listen to the voice of a leader
Teach me how to be brave even in my dying day
The truth could never be taken from your lips
The shortness of breath you were clutching your chest
The world went black but for only a moment
You opened your eyes and they locked to mine
Never afraid you were never broken
I see now as youâre reaching out you never let a second pass away
Unbreakable reflection of grace teach me how to be brave in my last day

Teach me how to be brave in my last day
Teach me how to be brave in my last day
Teach me how to be brave in my last day
