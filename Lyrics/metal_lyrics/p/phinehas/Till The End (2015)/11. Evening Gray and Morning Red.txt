Wading in dark waters, a shovel at my side
Digging a grave for the depths to fill with defeat that I would hide
Hearing grace kiss the waves but afraid of the breakers roar
Who would set sail to hold a candle amidst a thunderstorm?

Like a hand grasping to sand I am filled and emptied constantly
How could I quiet the ocean thatâs in front of me?
Toil and sweat and aspiration is but wringing rags into the deep
Tell me how I would ever stay the swarming seas

Am I chasing the wind?
Am I drowning in the shallow end?

Counting every step I take and boundaries youâve assigned
But Davy Jones he beckons me back to die amongst the brine
Feet still sinking further, my bodyâs run a shore
Only in my nightmares have I seen this once before

Drowning in the shallow under the weight of the undertow
Drowning in the shallow under the weight of the undertow

Like a hand grasping to sand I am filled and emptied constantly
How could I quiet the ocean thatâs in front of me?
Toil and sweat and aspiration is but wringing rags into the deep
Tell me how I would ever stay the swarming seas

Am I chasing the wind?
Am I drowning in the shallow end?
Am I chasing the wind?
Am I drowning in the shallow end?
