Dead end - prove yourself

Motives lost in translation to nullification
You lied your way into fame
Scheming and slaying were perks for the taking
Stars in your eyes but you were playing a game

Hear suspicion proving itself

Dead end - jester and faker
Before your maker, wish a truce between you two
Dead end - take a bow for your act
âCause the curtain will fall on your neck like a noose
(Yeah)

Hail marys arenât enough
Your bodyâs ripe with rust
Hearing your scales scraping the ground
That disgusting and piercing sound

Hear suspicion proving itself

Fire - make sure to do your worst
Hail marys arenât enough because youâll still be cursed
Fire - make sure to do your worst
I hear suspicion proving itself

The curtain will fall on your neck like a noose
Fire - hail marys arenât enough âcause youâll still be cursed
Fire - make sure to do your worst
I hear suspicion proving itself

Dead end - jester and faker
Before your maker, wish a truce between you two
Dead end - the whole crowd will applaud
When the curtain falls on your neck like a noose
