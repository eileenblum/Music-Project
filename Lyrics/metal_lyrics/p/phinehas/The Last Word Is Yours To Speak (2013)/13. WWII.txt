Dear father I must first confess
that from the stone inside my chest
I have nothing to offer you

I'm shaken by your righteousness
at a loss of words to do justice
so grant me grace in silence

I will learn to love you
and abandon the rest

If your children lost their voice to sing
and fled the shadow of your wing
would you reveal yourself to us?

Crashing waves calm at your feet
but further still my body sinks
I am a man of little faith

But I will learn to love you
and abandon the rest

Not abandoned
Bound by grace we sing
You are my everything

My last breath is yours
My last breath is yours to breathe

My last word is yours
My last word is yours to speak

To love you and abandon the rest
