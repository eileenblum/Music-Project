Every time my eyes fall to the stare of the unknown
You take the night and replace it with your dawn
When my path is unclear and my courage starts to fade
You sow life in the deepest of graves

Somewhere between bearing my shame
and wearing my pain
You still find it in you to love me
for who I am

When I fall prey to the snares of distrust
You're reaching out or I'd be crushed
Break my fears and shatter my guilt
An eternity of weight is gone

Bearing my shame
and wearing my pain
You still find it in you to love me
Somewhere between bearing my shame
and wearing my pain
You still find it in you to love me
for who I am

I never cease to fail you
But you still love me past my debt

You sow life in the deepest of graves

(For miles) I see no end to your flowing grace
You sow life in the deepest of graves

Bearing my shame
and wearing my pain
You still find it in you to love me
Somewhere between bearing my shame
and wearing my pain
You still find it in you to love me
for who I am
