The confines of my eyes but allow a sliver of light
Upon a pale blue sphere what purpose could I have
Climb with me to the top of the clouds
But I find that I am truly alone

Can you hear my cicada's song
droning through the darkness?
Blurring the words and fading the meaning
until only static is left
Climb with me to the top of the clouds
But I find that I am truly alone

'I am who contains the universe
who makes the ocean floor a road
I am who cranes the stars in place
I am who your mind cannot encase
Can you even think of me without reducing me?'

I want to see you in all your glory
Clothed in clouds too big of a story
I wanna see you in all of your glory
I want to see you in all your glory
Prove it to me
I want to see you in all your glory
Clothed in clouds too big of a story
I want to see you in all of your glory
Prove it to me

'You'd be lost to madness...

Can you even think of me without reducing me?
I piece together dislocated limbs of the galaxy

I'm looking down from the clouds all over creation
while you cling to the filthy means but it's my blood that you're washed in
Look up to the stars that I've set out like lanterns
to illuminate my child superseding your ransom
You live your life in the cracks of an infinite canvas
A mere fraction of a note in eternal stanzas

The beginning, the end and what comes after
They point to me: I am their master'
