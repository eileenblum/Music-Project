To think of all the lives they've taken
Thrown in an endless void
Worth is not assigned by a man on a screen
Nor love by where we sleep
We conceal who we truly are
In hopes to thrill an audience
But there's not enough make up in this world
To cover all our scars

A coward said that you'll never amount to anything
You've still got the breath in your lungs enough to fight the apathy

Raise your voices loud and clear
They will tremble when they hear
We are not abandoned anymore
We're aiming to find you now
This is the last time you sell us out
We will not be silent anymore

Desensitizing every truth we hold
A dystopic nightmare
Worth is not assigned by a man on a screen
Nor love by where we sleep

Raise your voices loud and clear
They will tremble when they hear
We are not abandoned anymore
We are aiming to find you now
This is the last time you sell us out
We will not be silent anymore

Reveal yourself for who you are
Apathy is dead

A coward said that you'll never amount to anything
You've still got the breath in your lungs enough to fight the apathy
So walk out from behind those gates and feel the sun burn upon your face
You will be bestowed a new name etched in stone
Born in flame

We are born from a burning sun
We are more than what's inside the gates we're from
Apathy is dead
Reveal yourself for who you are
