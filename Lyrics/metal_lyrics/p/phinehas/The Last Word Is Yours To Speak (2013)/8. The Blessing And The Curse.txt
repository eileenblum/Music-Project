Get me back to the days when I felt young
When love was beautiful
Not just a touch to con
Over these years I've deadened my nerves
Friction for validation
Take me back

You are the blessing
and I am the curse
I'm ready to run like a child
away from the hell I deserve

Waiting in this darkened room
You're still fresh on my lungs
Hoping for a sign to prove I'm over the edge
Cut me from what's burnt on my eyes
Cut me away
I still wear you branded on my skin

You are the blessing
and I am the curse
I'm ready to run like a child
away from the hell I deserve
You are the garden
and I am the drought
I'm emptied over the weeks away
Too fond of this bed to see it out

Are my roots too low?
Am I drying up too fast to follow?
Have my veins run dry?
Will I ever hear your voice again
or feel your healing hand?

(Even in the storm, I can hear you now)
Cut me away from the lies that this world has fed me
(You're still there, you call be back)
Give me a sign, I still wear her branded on my skin
(Even in the storm, I can hear you now)
Show me love for what you mean't it to be
(You're still there, you call me back)
Take me back
(Even in the storm, I can hear you now)
Lest I run headfirst into my lust
(You're still there, you call me back)
and further away from any future trust
