Ignite my veins with your blood to inspire new verses
I'm drained to my dregs
Replace my eyes with your fire to burn through the curses
Leave nothing that could hinder your blinding light

Test me in the furnace of affliction
Refine me as you wish
When the die is cast
Breathe in me your animating spark

I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So take me now
It's not my blood to bleed
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So I cry out:
The last word is yours to speak

Sharpen my tongue with precision only your words convey
I've kept waiting too long
Breathe in my lungs a passion that strangles corruption
Till there's nothing left

Fleshkiller
We're engraved on your hand

Test me in the furnace of affliction
Refine me as you wish
When the die is cast
Breathe in me your animating spark

I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So take me now
It's not my blood to bleed
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So I cry out:
The last word is yours to speak

Fleshkiller
Disease has no grasp on your reign
Fleshkiller
Prison cells won't contain your light

With every crushing blow
we are engraved upon your hand

I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So take me now
It's not my blood to bleed
I won't flinch when the Earth gives way
So I cry out:
The last word is yours to speak
