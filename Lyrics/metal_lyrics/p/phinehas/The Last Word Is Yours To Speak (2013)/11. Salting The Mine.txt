We're only looking back to see the miles we've left behind
What we thought was finished has only marked the beginning
I'm done with wasting my time to pay for your trend
You've been played out for years and it makes me so sick to watch

We walk a tight rope to stay alive
You repeat yourself over and over
It's another day, another lie
They will chew you up just to spit you out

We're only looking back to see the miles we've left behind
What we thought was finished has only marked the beginning

The more you talk the less your words hold weight
A herd of cattle led to the butcher's block and put to sleep

A wise man once told me that "the only originality left is honesty." - Seth Webster

We walk a tight rope to stay alive
You repeat yourself over and over
It's another day, another lie
They will chew you up just to spit you out

So don't buy in, you're just another ticket sold

We walk a tight rope to stay alive
You repeat yourself over and over
It's another day, another lie
They will chew you up just to spit you out

We walk a tight rope to stay alive
It's getting old
It's another day, another lie
Don't buy in you're just another ticket sold

They'll chew you up just to spit you out
So don't buy in
I'm not gonna pay for your trend
