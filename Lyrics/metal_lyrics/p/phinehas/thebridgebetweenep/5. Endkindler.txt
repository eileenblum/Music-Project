I've seen you change with the season's wind
Watch you fall before the spell's end
Unlocked and waiting was the door
A teasing sight then the rain begins to pour

But I can't see past the clouds
To your plan beyond my eyes
Past the winter
If the world gets cold then why don't I build a fire

Unhindered ending of unanswered love
I shot an arrow through your stainless dove
My hesitation keeps me stuck at port
Your grace upon the waves means nothing stayed ashore

But I can't see past the clouds
To your plan beyond my eyes
Past the winter
If the world gets cold then why don't I build a fire

But I can't see past the clouds
To your plan beyond my eyes
Past the winter
If the world gets cold then why don't I build a fire

So let loose the words to break these chains to meet you halfway
In a dead-cold world I'll strike flame

But I can't see past the clouds
To your plan beyond my eyes
Past the winter
If the world gets cold then why don't I build a fire

But I can't see past the clouds
To your plan beyond my eyes
Past the winter
If the world gets cold then why don't we build a fire
