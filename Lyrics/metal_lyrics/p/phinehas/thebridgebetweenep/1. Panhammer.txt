Come on come on, are you a dead man?
Pull up your skirt, we're on a mission.
WHO SAID WE'VE WON?
We need a hero not a politician.

Don't you know our legs will never carry us far enough
When we've put our faith in a map a blind man drew for us
The attrition of this nation will seal it's fate
Light of the world illuminate

POW
Oh yeah
Won't you blind us all?
Oh yeah
Show us your scars.

My hounds were bred of the golden kind, so flew'd, so sanded
Follow the march to the end of the world two by two

DEAD MAN what are you waiting for?
DEAD MAN get ahold of yourself and pull some swagger! 

Come on come on, are you a dead man?
Pull up your skirt, we're on a mission.
WHO SAID WE'VE WON?
We need a hero not a politician.
