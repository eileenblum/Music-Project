This is what it's like to be on fire
Burning through the coals
What a way to release this fury
And be consumed
A false prophet and a terrible liar
Trading money for souls
Abomination of a broad horizon
You sold them for a frail mansion

It's nothing but dust
Your recompense and tongue
Will be fed down your throat
Oh youâd topple the pillars of a church
To make yourself a god

When you speak, itâs a dead language
When you speak, itâs a dead language

Forfeit (the grace you never...) preach
Forfeit
The grace you never preach
The grace you never preach
The grace you never preach
The grace you never preach

Limb for limb
Youâll be torn to shreds
Eye for an eye
You'll be torn to shreds

Throw it down like you never want to see it again
Come on!
If this is a slippery slope
Youâre at the bottom of the ditch
Take advantage of the children
Yet you call yourself a man
If this is a slippery slope
Youâre at the bottom of the ditch
Headlong
Headlong
Come on!
