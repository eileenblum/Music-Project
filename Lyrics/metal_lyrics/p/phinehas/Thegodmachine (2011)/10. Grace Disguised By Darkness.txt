I've felt their lives slip through my fingers
Now I watch them circle the drain
With breath like the torrent
They sink to the bottom
I've wasted so many chances
My efforts not a drop in the barrel
With a body like a boulder
I sink to the bottom

Where is your mercy?
Where is your mercy now?
Where is your mercy?
Cause I've shown my teeth and have had them kicked in one too many times
(Where is your mercy? Where is your mercy?)
And in my yearning He split the rock, and the water gushed forth

A voice keeps yelling, a voice keeps yelling
"This is where your proud waves end"
My fingers trace lines
On the surface I'm consumed
The sinking feeling, sinking feeling
"This is where your proud waves end"
I take my first step
And I'm thrown over the edge

I tried to walk on the water
But now I just swim
They slip through my fingers
Now I watch them circle the drain
With breath like the torrent
They sink to the bottom
I've wasted so many chances
My efforts not a drop in the barrel
With a body like a boulder
I sink to the bottom

Where is your mercy?
Where is your mercy now?
Where is your mercy?
Where is your mercy?
Where is your mercy now?
Where is your mercy?
What grace is this that saves me
(Where is your mercy? Where is your mercy now?)
What grace is this that saves me
(Where is your mercy? Where is your mercy now?)
What grace is this that saves me
(Where is your mercy? Where is your mercy now?)
What grace is this that saves me
(Where is your mercy? Where is your mercy now?)
Where is your mercy now? Where?
Are you listening, oh God?

I scream Your name, Your name, Your name
Are You outside of Your wrath, oh God?
Your name
And amongst the pile of dead
I see a light split the water from the heavens
And I feel God glowing inside me
My heart shakes with the music of the spheres
I no longer tremble in fear
For Redemption has found me
And in Redemption comes the overflow of peace
