Son of mine!
Can you hear the sound
Hear the sound of this repetition as clockwork
I'm always peeling back your skin
To rip the legions from your heart
Every scar you leave yourself
Is a jewel in the making
I would give new passion
Yet you've turned your back

Like a devil of details
(Cut your throat)
You're so addicted
You'll swing the hammer
I'll turn your nails to gold

Like a devil of details
You're so addicted
You'll swing the hammer
I'll turn your nails to gold

You will know My voice
When the hair on your neck stands up
I opened this door
And I will bring the end

All gives way and all will fall
To their knees and beg for grace
Son of Mine, these letters
I swear have not been burnt

My heart, a child
Trembling in sight of his wake
(Trembling in sight of his wake)
Is longing to rest in the hollow
Hollow of Your hand
I know now what it is to be helpless
Like a foot on my neck to the ground
I'm longing to rest in the hollow
Hollow of Your hand
Here I am
I await you

You will know My voice
Here I am

My heart, a child
Trembling in sight of his wake
(Trembling in sight of his wake)
Is longing to rest in the hollow
Hollow of Your hand
I know now what it is to be helpless
Like a foot on my neck to the ground
I'm longing to rest in the hollow
Hollow of Your hand
Hollow (hollow) of Your hand

I am the Lion!

Clear the path
I am the Lion
You brood of snakes
I am the Lion
