Draw your depiction
Stars become scars in the palm of Your hand
Bridged by blood
Your blood paints the paragon of unrequited love (unrequited love)
Do you remember pain followed by reassurance
And the light shining through
Bearing the poise of a Redeemer
Choking the shadows defeating death

Providence:
Laid out before us
Fatherâs arms
Reaching as
The nations will hear a new song
As weâre lead to the water
The nations will hear a new song
As weâre lead to the water

Give us discernment
Doors that glow at the sound
Of forerunnersâ words (forerunners' words)
We are empty
Until you sit at the throne of our hearts
Break us free
Unshackled from our dire condition
We have hope

Kings of earth, bow down
Lose your crowns
Kings of earth, bow down
Lose your crowns
Bow!

The nations will hear a new song
As weâre lead to the water
The nations will hear a new song
Of rebirth
Of rebirth

The nations will hear...
The nations will hear...
The nations will hear a new song
The nations will hear a new song
As we're lead to the water
A new song...
A new song...
