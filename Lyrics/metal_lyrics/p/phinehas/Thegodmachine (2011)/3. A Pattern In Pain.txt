As I charge the bloody fields
Waiting for your hands to pierce the depths
The world is stirring
Yet you keep silent to me

This battle shakes the ground
But your voice could split the earth
The world is stirring
Yet you keep silent to me

Eternity will never be long enough with you
When every step I take feels so worn
If heralds of glory sing
The minute life begins to fade
Then death is just a bridge between us

See the enemy line the hills
So hide my fears from me
The world is stirring
Yet you keep silent to me

Like a burning wound it kills me
That I haven't heard you in years
The world is stirring
Yet you keep silent

Eternity will never be long enough with you
When every step I take feels so worn
If heralds of glory sing
The minute life begins to fade
Then death is just a bridge between us

All I am is a scar-laden body
&gt;From those years you were gone
Now You appear to me
Faced with suffering death
You restore this porous heart that bleeds
Tvery time it beats
Your suture lives in me
There must be something You wished me to see
A pattern in this pain

I see a pattern
I see You in this pain
I've waited for years
For what a brush with death has shown me
I will trust in Your grace
That speaks of the end
As my life begins to fade
I know Your blood was the bridge
The bridge between us

Your blood was the bridge between us
Your blood
(Your blood was the bridge between us)
Your blood
(Your blood was the bridge between us)
Your blood
(Your blood was the bridge between us)
Your blood
