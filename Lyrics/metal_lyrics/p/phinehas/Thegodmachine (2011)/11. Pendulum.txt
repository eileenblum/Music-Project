Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from your feet
The seas and valleys all run dry
Reach through the sky and capture me

Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from your feet
The seas and valleys all run dry
Reach through the sky and capture me

Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from your feet
The seas and valleys all run dry
Reach through the sky and capture me

Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from your feet
The seas and valleys all run dry
Reach through the sky and capture me

Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from your feet
The seas and valleys all run dry
Reach through the sky and capture me

My heart a child trembling in sight of his wake
(Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from your feet)
Your blood was the bridge between us
(The seas and valleys all run dry
Reach through the sky and capture me)
(A new song)

My heart a child trembling in sight of his wake
(Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from your feet)
Your blood was the bridge between us
(The seas and valleys all run dry
Reach through the sky and capture me)
(A new song)

Reach through the sky and capture me
