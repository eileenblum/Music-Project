A thunderstorm a distant shore
Iâve witnessed this before
Patience was fleeting
If a thousand coins on the ocean floor would bring back love to me
Iâll wait forever

Fill the sea with dreams of a wishing well
Waves bring back my coins to me
Drain the deep that teems with my empty shells
Slaves of sand still call for me

I once had love to give
I once had hoped to live
The rarest stones will break my bones
And golden salt stops my lungs
The perfect limbs and haunting eyes
Begs the seas: begin to rise

Fill the sea with dreams of a wishing well
Waves bring back my coins to me
Drain the deep that teems with my empty shells
Slaves of sand still call for me

[Man:]
And when these delusions come to fruition
Believe you me
I'll strangle my self into nothingness, nothingness
And be reborn from the dream of a blasphemous fool
In my sordid pelt of mold
Iâll earn back years to me
The god of a nightmare will fall
As I take back what isâ¦

[Devil:]
Mine!
Worthless swine
Enraptured by my vanity
Your soul sank under the weight
Of gold you offered me

[Man:]
A waste of a life, squandered my heart until it rests
On the ocean floor, barren
Watching the light descend
Deeper and deeper
A deadening feeling starts to grow in my ribs
From where I lie

([Devil:] From where I hide)
[Man:] The waves overflow
([Devil:] The snakes overgrown)
[Man:] With my blood
([Devil:] With your blood)

[Man:]
Where are my years?
Iâll bleed dry by myself
I wish I was someone

[Devil:]
You wish you were someone else
You wish you were someone else
You wish you were someone else...
