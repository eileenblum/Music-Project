Part the dark sky
That keeps me from Your eyes
Even as the darkness descends
My cry came to Your ears
As my heroes fail me
They leave me to fend on my own
My cry came to Your ears

The earth withers beneath me
I'm always looking towards the clouds
I know we are not alone
Can't help but feel You in my bones

When all is dead and gone
Your love will still remain
From one end of the sky to the other
You burn your banner
Cords of the grave
Snares of death
Cannot take me from You
I see the eyes of the empty
They form an eclipse above me
Until I find
Safety in Your memory
Safety in Your memory
Safety in Your memory
Safety in the memory
Of Your faithfulness

Bright lights are breaking through the sky
Dark clouds are pouring from Your feet
The seas and valleys all run dry
So reach through the sky and capture me
My cry came to Your ears
(Bright lights are breaking through the sky)
Dark clouds are pouring from Your feet
Your love saved no mercy for Yourself
Reach through the sky and capture me!

The earth withers beneath me
I'm always looking towards the clouds
I know we are not alone
Can't help but feel You in my bones

When all is dead and gone
Your love will still remain
From one end of the sky to the other
You burn your banner

The earth withers beneath me
I'm always looking towards the clouds
I know we are not alone
Can't help but feel You in my...
Bones
