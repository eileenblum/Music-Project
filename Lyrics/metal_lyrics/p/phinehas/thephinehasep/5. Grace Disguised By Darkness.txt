Iâve felt their lives slip through my fingers.
Now I watch them circle the drain.
With breath like the torrent (THEY SINK SINK)
To the bottom.
Iâve wasted so many chances,
My effortsâ not a drop in the barrel.
With a body like a boulder (I SINK SINK)
To the bottom.

Iâve shown my teeth and have had them kicked in one too many times.
In my yearning He split the rock, and the water gushed forth.

A voice keeps yelling, a voice keeps yelling
âThis is where your proud waves endâ
My fingers trace lines, on the surface Iâm consumed.
The sinking feeling, the sinking feeling
âThis is where your proud waves endâ
I take my first step, Iâm thrown over the edge.

I TRIED TO WALK ON THE WATER, BUT NOW I JUST SWIM

They slipped through my fingers.
Now I watch them circle the drain.
With breath like the torrent (THEY SINK SINK)
To the bottom.
Iâve wasted so many chances,
My effortsâ not a drop in the barrel.
With a body like a boulder (I SINK SINK)
To the bottom.

I scream your name.
Are you outside of your wrath?
Oh God, I scream your name.

And amongst the pile of deadâ¦

I see a light split the water from the heavens,
And I feel God glowing inside me,
My heart SHAKES with the music of the spheres.
I no longer tremble in fear,
For Redemption has found me,
And in Redemption comes the overflowâ¦
