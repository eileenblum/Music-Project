Come on come on, are you a dead man?
Pull up your skirt, weâre on a mission.
WHO SAID WEâVE WON?
We need a hero not a politician.

Donât you know our legs will never carry us far enough
When weâve put our faith in a map a blind man drew for us
The attrition of this nation will seal its fate
Light of the world illuminate

POW
Oh yeah
Wonât you blind us all?
Oh yeah
Show us your scars.

My hounds were bred of the golden kind, so flewâd, so sanded
Follow the march to the end of the world two by two

DEAD MAN what are you waiting for?
DEAD MAN get a hold of yourself and pull some swagger!

Come on come on, are you a dead man?
Pull up your skirt, weâre on a mission.
WHO SAID WEâVE WON?
We need a hero not a politician.
