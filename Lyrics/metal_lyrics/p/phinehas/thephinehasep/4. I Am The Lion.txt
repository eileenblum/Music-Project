Son of Mine, can you hear the Sound of this repetition as clockwork?
Iâm always peeling back your skin to rip these legions from your heart.
Every scar you leave yourself is a Jewel in the making.
I would give new Passion, yet youâve turned your back.
A devil of details cut your throat.
Youâre so addicted.
Youâll swing the hammer and Iâll turn your nails to Gold.
You will know My voice when the hair on your neck stands up.
I opened this Door, and I will bring the End.
All gives way, and all will fall to their knees and beg for Grace.
Son of Mine these letters, I swear, have not been burnt.
My heart, a child trembling at the sight of his wake,
Is longing to rest in the hollow of Your hand.
I know now what it is to be helpless,
Like a foot on my neck to the ground,
I'm longing to rest in the hollow of Your hand.
Here I am.
I await you.
You will know My voice.
Here I am.
I AM THE LION.
Clear the path. I am the Lion.
You brood of snakes.
I am the Lion.
