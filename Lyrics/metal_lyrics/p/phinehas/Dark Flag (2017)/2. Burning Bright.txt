They stole you far away
To the end of the sea
From rib and clay
My lantern and key

Home is the narrow and wide reaches of our shared scars
On tomorrow's horizon I want
To believe I choose to see

When the sun is down
Show me how to reflect like the moon
The key is in my hands and I choose to burn bright
Safe years behind me burn bright

I know now I am not alone
You've always found me in the deep of night
I could die well here, before morning comes
Because I can see all the lights of the sun in your eyes

We spoke of lovely things
With guards not listening
We made plans to escape
Like in the movies

Confiding in scripts
Kindling in secret
Our home discrete
In captors' keep

In quiet still small moments

Wait till they leave us alone
And don't look back,
Cross with me over the threshold
My inimitable half

In quiet still small moments
I hear you breathe and I remember
I am alive

I found you under distant stars
You saw me through my deepest dark

I know now I am not alone
You've always found me in the deep of night
I could die well here, before morning comes
Because I can see all the lights of the sun in your eyes

Home is the narrow and wide reaches of our shared scars
On tomorrow's horizon
I can see all the lights of the sun in your eyes

The key in my hands and I choose to burn bright
Safe years behind me burn bright
