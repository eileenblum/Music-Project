I looked into darkness too long
Now it stares back

Welcome to the inside
The world's largest prison
Where the only way out
Is six feet deep

Forced to fear
By burden of indoctrination
A weight upon their eyelids
Asleep to the outside
The apotheosis of madness
Paints red a nation
Free will is a death sentence
There's no salvation

Mourn when I say mourn
Or make your graves with the resistance
Bow when I say bow
Or fade in a vacuum of nonexistence
Dark flag: the insurmountable curtain
Dark flag: how can we be found?

When light can't reach into shadow
How can we be found?
When light can't speak into me
It's trapped in-between hell and myself

With the teachings of the great leader: we pledge
We oath to hold our guns to defend the state: we pledge

Mourn when I say mourn
Or make your graves with the resistance
Bow when I say bow
Or fade in a vacuum of nonexistence
Dark flag: the insurmountable curtain
Dark flag: how can we be found?

Where paranoia runs rampant as hunger
Welcome to the inside
Drowning articulation
It feels like madness
With no end in sight
How can we be found?

When light can't reach into shadow
How can we be found?
When light can't speak into me
It's trapped in-between hell and myself

Shrouded in shadow
They threw away the key
I looked into darkness
Now it stares back at me

The only way out is six feet deep
Dark flag: how can we be found?
Dark flag: burn it to the ground
