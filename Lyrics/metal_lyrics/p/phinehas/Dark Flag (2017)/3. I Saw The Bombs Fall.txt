I awoke from a nightmare
In a fit consciousness slow
Cold sweat and colder air
Blinding flashes cast a shadow
Before the sound hit the square
The end of it all

They kept in from your TV screens
A slight of hand
But I dreamt of a lifeless rock
A cratered wasteland

It's not just an alternate reality
I saw the bombs fall
It's not just overseas
I saw the bombs fall

Are we really that far away?
Am I naÃ¯ve to think?
That this I only a dream
Is it really that hard to recall
What brought the end of it all?
We lost our chance to rewrite history

A path void of heroes
The abysmal waste of what could have been
Discerning only ones and zeroes
There's no space between for them
Peel back what covers your ears
Hear that a nation is crying out for mercy
Before it's too late for them to raise a sound
Mercy

Are we really that far away?
Am I naÃ¯ve to think?
That this is only a dream
Is it really that hard to recall?
What brought the end of it all?
We lost our chance to rewrite history

Between the bodies in trenches and the blistering sky
It's not just overseas: I saw the bombs fall
