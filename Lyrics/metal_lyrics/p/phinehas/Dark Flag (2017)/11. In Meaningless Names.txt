Counting days with each cell door creak
I know the number of every chain link
Grieving walls draw near to mind
The deafening hush of waiting to die

Hold fast to hope of another day
Hold fast it can't last forever
The meaningless names of far off places
I have to believe something better awaits

I sense a waste in every exhale
Breath escapes iron bar and nail
Forgotten silence condemned
Darkness as my only friend

But hold fast to hope of another day
Hold fast it can't last forever
The meaningless names of far off places
I have to believe something better awaits

I am waiting to die among a swarm of flies
Every day is a lifetime in chains
Every day

Hold fast to hope of another day
Hold fast it can't last forever
The meaningless names of far off places
I have to believe something better awaits

I have to believe. I have to believe
