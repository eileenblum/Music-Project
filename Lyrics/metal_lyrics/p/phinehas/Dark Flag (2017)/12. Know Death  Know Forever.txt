I had to be broken to be pieced back together
I had to know death to know forever

An angel hiding in the hearts of a stone
And the sculptor's patient means
Cutting through rubble to the bone
To carve her into being
The unsung and lonely orphan
And the namer of names
A refuge and father given
Granting title, will, and claim

Broken; pieced back together
Know death; know forever

When sorrows rise
The thorns in my side
Make me alive
I wear my scars like a crown
I had to be lost to be found

Oh captive wearer of chains
And the holder of keys
Deliver ankles and wrists from pain
To abound as eternally free

Broken to be pieced back together
I had to know death to know forever

When sorrows rise
The thorns in my side
Make me alive
I wear my scars like a crown
I had to be lost to be found

Broken before the maker
All death will know forever

I wear my scars like a crown
I had to be lost to be found
