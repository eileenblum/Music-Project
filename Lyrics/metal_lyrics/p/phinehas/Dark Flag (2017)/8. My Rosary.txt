Is there a power without or within?
Hope isn't grown, hope is awakened
The threat of law can't outweigh conviction
Hope isn't grown, hope is awakened

Where are you now?
Are you present of an accident?
My rosary
Where are you now?
Will my faith meet sight or bayonet?
My rosary

My first free choice was lying to the state
Given context to what lies past the gate
The fog surrounding my camp began to disperse
We took our chance for the fence but I wasn't first

I've found that running away isn't the same as being free
I'm paralyzed in my sleep
Running away isn't the same as being free
You were my compass
My rosary

Hope isn't grown, hope is awakened

I slipped on ice and watched your hands reach out
Shaking as coils sent current throughout
Grounding the brunt of what should have been my fate
Opening the wires sending fire through your veins
Like a bridge I crawled over you to the outside
My first breath of freedom was your last breath of life

I've found that running away isn't the same as being free
I'm paralyzed in my sleep
Running away isn't the same as being free
You were my compass
My rosary

Is there a power without or within?
Hope isn't grown, hope is awakened
The threat of law can't outweigh conviction
Hope isn't grown, hope is awakened

Where are you now? Are you present?
Where are you now? Are you an accident?
