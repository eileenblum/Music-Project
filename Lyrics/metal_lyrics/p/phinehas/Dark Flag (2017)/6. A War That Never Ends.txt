First light under quiet clouded cloak
All hell broke the ridge
Wry trees up a narrow trail
A wordless story a war that never ends

Brothers and sisters sleep in a bed hollowed by staves
Like discarded shells from guns of powerful men
Last one lays in red under swinging single light
No pulse: a war that never ends

How clever you lie
How many ways you kill
Your cure is worse than the disease
Your sated shrine
Your cup overfilled
Your cure is worse than the disease

Our proudest legacy is how unendingly we scheme
Of new ways to kill than condemn
A war that never ends

It became our greatest prize to keenly wield skill to devise
More ways to cut than to mend
A war that never ends

How clever you lie
How many ways you kill
Your cure is worse than the disease
Your sated shrine
Your cup overfilled
Your cure is worse than the disease
A war that never ends
