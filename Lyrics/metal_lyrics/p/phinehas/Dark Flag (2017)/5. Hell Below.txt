I sowed the salt but the bitter weeds still grow
I fear a heaven above for the hell below

I wept when guilt by association stared in irony
Avoiding its eyes bowing three times
I watched as hopes expire under the weight
Of standards I create and betray

One day they sunk hungry fangs into the hand that feeds
A hand that bleeds
In trying to stifle their voices
I bowed their limbs, they bowed my knees

Struck to silence by the gavel
Make him bleed for playing God
I sowed the salt but the bitter weeds still grow
I fear a heaven above for the hell below

Lost in the waves of a sea of fire
One million portraits to fan the flame
Burned in effigy
A fitting end to a cult of personality

Struck to silence by the gavel
Make him bleed for playing God
I sowed the salt but the bitter weeds still grow
I fear a heaven above for the hell below

Called to the judgement seat
Eye for an eye watch a man playing God bleed

Struck to silence by the gavel
Make him bleed for playing God
I sowed the salt but the bitter weeds still grow
I fear a heaven above for the hell below

Turn to the last page to see just how this ends

I fear a heaven above for the hell below
