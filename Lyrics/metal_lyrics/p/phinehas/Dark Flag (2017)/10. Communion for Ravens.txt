[feat. Jimmy Ryan]The smell of wine turned
Bread beneath the gallows tree
Ode to the nameless; a hooded child
Communion for ravens

No hope to lose; no past to mourn
Born a slave deep in the earth
A famine stricken cursed womb
Nothing is sacred
The only escape is death
You would torture my family
To litter my tomb

I refuse to live dead any longer

Hooks in the wall over open flame
Silence escape
Bowing heads into the earth
No hope; no name

I refuse to live dead any longer

The smell of wine turned
Bread beneath the gallows tree
Ode to the nameless; a hooded child
Communion for ravens

I saw the stone walls fall
Crushing their will to dust
Swept away with the river's current
But still I see every face

In blood or famine
Silence escape
Grow old to die here
No hope; no name

I refuse to live dead any longer

The smell of wine turned
Bread beneath the gallows tree
Ode to the nameless; a hooded child
Communion for ravens

I refuse to live dead any longer
