If all it takes is a voice to lead,
Rise up Moses and teach me to speak
If all it takes is a mustard seed,
I'll trade my heart to move a mountain in me

Struck me like lightning and called me by thunder

To raise an army underground
I hear the trumpet, the final sound
We will rise from barren lowly dirt
First to strike the stone, break the earth

Taunt the jaws of lions
And you will suffer teeth
Lash the backs of my people
You'll be scarred to bone underneath

Oh I pray for the day my words unleash the rain

If all it takes is a voice to lead
Rise up Moses and teach me to speak
If all it takes is a mustard seed
I'll trade my heart to move a mountain in me

Move a mountain in me
Break the earth

Heels to the throat of liberty
Always withdraw broken
Forbidden words of prophets
In time will be spoken
Rise up, from barren lowly dirt
Rise up, strike the stone, break the earth

If you reap what you've sown, why has nothing grown
Oh I pray for the day my words unleash the rain

If all it takes is a voice to lead
Rise up Moses and teach me to speak
If all it takes is a mustard seed
I'll trade my heart to move a mountain in me

Struck me like lightning and called me by thunder

To raise an army underground
I hear the trumpet, the final sound
We will rise from barren lowly dirt
First to strike the stone, break the earth
