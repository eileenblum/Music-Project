[feat. Garrett Russell of Silent Planet]When I was sick the blind looked down through their nose to me
When I a stranger has turned back at the photo of your wall between
I was naked faceless shame became my chains you deserve to let me rot
You replace me with tall trees the privacy that you sought well I was the cause

A book of names
But every page is empty
A neighborhood lacking other faces
I'd rather be left behind

You can go to heaven on your own
But it wouldn't be hell inside the gates all alone all alone
If god looks like you then I'd rather be left behind

Did you depart from me
Set anchor and walk along down the narrow seas
Stepping to shores
Piously removed from my incessant floorboard
Do you dream your chest can fill all the weight of our exhale
Sick sail so you might climb become the vine of sin
24 and a half score away from me how intellectually we shrunk
God to fit my needs slowly it occurs to me amidst this blissful apostasy
I'm less ensnared by heresy than the trenches I dug between them and me

A book of names
But every page is empty
A neighborhood lacking other faces
I'd rather be left behind

You can go to heaven on your own
But it wouldn't be hell inside the gates all alone all alone
If god looks like you then I'd rather be left behind

Amazing grace how sweet the sound of silence
Where you prepare the home to lock the doors and throw the key away

You can go to heaven on your own
But it wouldn't be hell inside the gates all alone all alone
If god looks like you then I'd rather be left behind
