Forever west follow the sunset
Leave the past in the darkness behind you
Forever west don't let the sun set
Don't look back never look back

If you should find yourself all alone
Remembering the cold the night air brought
Its sting like salt biting the knives in our backs
We were waiting for a glint of light preceding dawn
When the hills bled paint like fire on the horizon
Upon a golden canvas sky

Forever west follow the sunset
Leave the past in the darkness behind you
Forever west don't let the sun set
Don't look back never look back

If you should find yourself alone my stars will point you back to me
You'll have to fight through the night for what's at stake
You'll have to fight through the night until morning breaks
Fight through the night

The shadows grew as the light fell dim
To remind me of my struggle within
A contrast sharp enough to piece my heart
But I'll run until my legs go numb away away from the dark

Forever west follow the sunset
Leave the past in the darkness behind you
Forever west don't let the sun set
Don't look back never look back

Forever west
Follow the sunset
Forever west
Forever forever

You'll have to fight through the night
You'll have to fight through the night
