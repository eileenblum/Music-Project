The moment I heard your footsteps shake upon the ground
It betrayed every hint of truth that fumbled out your mouth
The song you sang moved mountains silence by fear
The unnerving complacency you wash down with your years

Dead choir
Does it help you sleep at night
Dead choir
To judge those you've put out of sight
You're no man of faith you are incapable of change
And you've never been awake

Sing me a song not with empty words but with feet that follow
Sing me a song so sweet to hear but long since forgotten
Grace come my way

How can you love a god you cannot see
When you hate your fellow man standing in front of me
When will you remember that love first made you sing
The words that jumped off the pages to comfort suffering

Dead choir
You think you're serving someone else
Dead choir
But you're only fooling yourself
You're no man of faith you're a liar and a fake
You refuse to ever change

Without grace we would all be dead
Without grace we would all be dead
Without grace we would all be dead
Without grace we would all be dead
Without grace we would all be dead
Without grace we would all be

Sing me a song not with empty words but with feet that follow
Sing me a song so sweet to hear but long since forgotten
Grace come my way

Without grace we would all be dead
Without grace we would all be
