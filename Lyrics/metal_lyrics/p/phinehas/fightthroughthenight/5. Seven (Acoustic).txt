I awoke in silence to broken glass
Blood stains the floor where I lay in separate halves
Trapped inside my mind my head welcomed the ground
Cursing in vain but my words offer no sound

I am lost in the spiral
My shame is stronger than desire for survival
An angel pushed me when I was pulling away
Despite my best attempts she decided to stay
Trapped in the cracks of an empty shell
On borrowed time that was spent in hell
The sum of all my fears
Strung out over seven long long years

Drugs traverse my veins and leave me clutching the numb
My voice flies away further from my useless tongue
I sit quiet and still and hear worms eating the church
Maybe I believe them but I'm drunk from drinking my words

I am lost in the spiral
My shame is stronger than desire for survival
An angel pushed me when I was pulling away
Despite my best attempts she decided to stay
Trapped in the cracks of an empty shell
On borrowed time that was spent in hell
The sum of all my fears
Strung out over seven long long years

I am more than dead weight floating adrift
But I could never feel it brush my lips
You ask me to span the void inside
But I believe my borrowed time's run dry

I won't drag you down anymore
