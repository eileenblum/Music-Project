Fighting for balance, control of my life
A healing, a peace of solace in a world that can be so unkind
Forgiving, no one can see when cycles are complete
Our world of decay crumbles away, look at our fall from grace

Our world in confusion we live in dilutions
Start grasping to hold what little control

Fighting for balance, control of my life
A healing, a peace of solace in a world that can be so unkind
Forgiving, no one can see when cycles are complete
Our world of decay crumbles away, look at our fall from grace

Our world in confusion we live in dilutions
Start grasping to hold what little control
The mortal revisions of global division
Our world of confusion has no real solutions now

No real solutions now
In a world that can be so unkind
Look at our fall from grace

Our world in confusion we live in dilutions
Start grasping to hold what little control
The mortal revisions of global division
Our world of confusion has no real solutions now, now

Ssh, yeah
