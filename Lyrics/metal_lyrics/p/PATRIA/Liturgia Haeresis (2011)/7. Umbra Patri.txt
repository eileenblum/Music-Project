Creatures of mist
Supremacy of spiritual mysteries
Thirsty by the ancestral pain
That consumes the mortal beings.

Free of human feelings
They attack corpses, shatter minds
Implanting nightmares through chaos.

Sentenced to madness
They look for redemption
In the limbonic pleasure
Where inhabit their darkest desires
Sorrounded by old souls,
Forsalen by the own time.

Cold mortuary, temple of misery
Suffering that corrodes dead hearts
Conquering the end of deception era
In the darkness we find the truth
That guide us to the gates of eternity
Rusted and sealed up!
Smelling blood and death!
Taking out the hope to
The complex immortality.

Creatures of mist
Supremacy of spiritual mysteries.
