Voices whisper in my subconscious
Storms haunt this cold land
Everything I hear are winds blowing.

Blood freezing veins
Pain terrorizing souls.

Captor in hell
Condemned to suffer eternally
Take this pain
Silence all the voices.

Carrying me from this land
To the Death's empire.

Dark clouds nearing the horizon

Death's empire conqueror
Death's empire conqueror.

Let the age of darkness come
Undo what the believers did
Our battle must be conquered.

Captor in hell
Condemned to suffer eternally
Take this pain
Silence all the voices.

Death's empire conqueror.
