Accept your shaded heritage
Feeding your soul
Procreating impure dreams
While the absolution bells tolls.

This is the underworld temple
Your real fatherland
Stronger than death
Destroyer of lies.

Underworld temple.

Be proud for the end
Anxious for the reborn
Your desires are blind
And will be realized
Through the spiritual healing
From a failed humanity.

On knees and expect for your death
This is your liberation
Profane rites of vengeance
Singing chorus in the valley of shadows.
