[originally by Amorphis]This is how the lucky feel 
How the blessed think 
Like daybreak in spring 
The sun on a spring morning. 

But how do I feel 
In my gloomy depths? 

Like the flat brink of a cloud 
Like a dark night in autumn 
A black winter day 
No, darker than that 
Gloomier than an autumn night.
