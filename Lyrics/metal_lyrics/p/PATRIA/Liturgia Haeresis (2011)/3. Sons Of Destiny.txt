Reincarnated feelings
Adopted soul
In solitude
Beyond a somber world.

Darkness conquering my wishes
Sadness bringing solutions.

A spirit passenger
Paying for its own sins
Seeking the forgiveness of evolution.

Fear me you inexistent master
You can't command me
Death based on death
Puppets of the universe.

Sons of destiny.

Alone, you can feel my death
Through the sons of destiny.
