The shadows dancers 
Soldiers of darkness
Rising swords eternally.

Sadness and fear
So cold in the soul's liturgy.

Darker than hatred 
Living in a death palace
Morbid solitude
Consumed by the anguish.

Feed the vultures
With the hearts of religions
Spirits of the immortal oath
Unleashing pain and suffering.

Setting fire in the altars
Devastated by the flames of vengeance
Burning crosses, carrying souls
To the dark desert dimension.

The shadows dancers 
Soldiers of darkness
Rising swords eternally
On behalf of the heresy.
