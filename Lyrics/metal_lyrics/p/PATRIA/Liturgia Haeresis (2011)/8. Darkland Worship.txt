Extinct in the monochrome life 
From the patria that sorrounds me
Attractive, inspiring fear 
Leading me to despair.

I even can't feel my soul destruction
Taken to the suicide,
With no escape preintention
That's my revolt to an apocalyptic world 
Devastated by the human irrationality.

I beg for the beginning of dark kingdom
Flames rising the purest beauty of death
That blinds the eyes of liars.

The moon bright unveiled the paths
In the middle of intense darkness
We're not immortal shades
Abandoned, with no blood, with no pain!

Feel the mist domain 
And reign this palace of destruction!
