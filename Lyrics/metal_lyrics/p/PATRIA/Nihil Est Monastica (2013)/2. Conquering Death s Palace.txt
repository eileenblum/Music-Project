Darkness affinity
Temple of disturbing minds
Upcoming nightmares
Surrounded by souls in pain
In scourge redemption

Priests of the strife
Illusions and death
Building the underworld
Into an iconographic fear
Impurity hearts feeds
By anguish thoughts

Architecture of pleasure
Raped chapels smelling
Like rotten blood

No life...
Faith based on misery
Forsaken spirits
Worshiping
The new dark era

Father of Sun
Take us
To the palace of death
Where the shadows
Inhabit the light

Darkness affinity
Temple of disturbing minds
Upcoming nightmares

Through the mist...
Pagan ceremonies
Rising the sword of truth

In my veinsruns no mercy
To dethrone the god of lies
Let's make him taste
Defeat consuming his light

No life!
