Devastated knees
Worshiping false gods
Nature is the real power
Becoming us the true immortals

Becoming us the true immortals!!!

The black forests are surrounding us
Blowing the winds of tragedy
Endless pagan reigns
The ascension of fire and death... Death!!!

Devastated knees
Worshiping false gods
Nature is the real power
Becoming us the true immortals

Becoming us the true immortals!!!

Swords on the fields
Smelling like old blood

Dust into your grave
Cold evil domain
Feel the intense winter
Fog everywhere

Darkness forever
An ode to the black death... Death!!!

Devastated knees
Worshiping false gods
Nature is the real power
Becoming us the true immortals

Choir of damnation!!!
