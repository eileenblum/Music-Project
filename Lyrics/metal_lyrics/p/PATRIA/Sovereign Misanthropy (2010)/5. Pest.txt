Agony...

At the forest
The moon shines the eternal night

I hear the war barrels echoing
Through the valley of death

Sword songs
Announcing the grand sacrifice
Evil and pain
Total darkness

Pest...
Pest...

Hate blood runs
Drenching the earth as a pest

Pagan crushing bastards
Sadness everywhere

At the forest
The moon shines the eternal night

Agony...
Agony...
