[originally by Songe D'enfer]Come oh triple Bombo, Infernal Goddess,
from earth and Celestial skies
Goddess of the paths and crossroads!
Eternal opposes (enemy) of the light who brings us light, 
awanderer of the night!...

A mist over shadows and sepulchres, 
enjoys the baying of wolves
and with the vapor of dripping blood
brings fear to the mortals ....

Oh! Gorgon! Mormo! Multifaced moon!
with lightning, comes a sacrifice in your honour!
Oh Gorgon! My Lady Princess of Hell...
