From the dark woods
The screams of despair
Supremacy and incantations
Coldest than evil spirits

Pagan night oracle
Stars crossing the skies
So supreme, mysterious
Beyond the throne of mist

The legend of salvation
Fuel the wicked hearts
New dark age is coming

Victory and blood
Carved inside my body
Circles of insanity
Feeding my lost spirit

From the dark woods
The screams of despair
Supremacy and incantations
Coldest than evil spirits

Pagan night oracle
Stars crossing the skies
So supreme, mysterious
Beyond the throne of mist
