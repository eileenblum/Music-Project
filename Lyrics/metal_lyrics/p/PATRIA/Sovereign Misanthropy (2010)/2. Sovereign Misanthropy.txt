Gates of madness
Evil inside me
Eternity of blasphemy
Time to pain and steel

There's no peace here
We came to make war
Marching on the death camp
Devastating corpses

Silence is my home
Time after time
Flying away from here
The suffocation starts

Misanthrope Cult
Alone in the dark night
Carrying souls
To supreme suicide

There's no peace here
We came to make war
Marching on the death camp
Devastating corpses
