Winds blows
Tearing the skin
Corrupting minds
With an inhuman feeling

Shadows into the dark night
The majesty winter moon

Winds that bring us memory
Of forgotten warriors
That battled at the old wars
Corpses disappeared beyond the shrubs

Reaching the master wish
The hearts don't stop to pulse
As the winds blows
As the mist hangs

Shadows into the dark night
The majesty winter moon
