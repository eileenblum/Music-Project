Corrosion of life
Fatality - a legend
Battles on the ground
Bleeding as your fault

Hate is your illusion
Love darker than death
Destroying pure hearts
Bring darkness to the end

Die, this is your fate
Crying rivers of blood
Rising the banner of insurrection

Redemption in your mind
Rot, blood, knife
Spreading pest and chaos
From the death I came to shine

In solitude and darkness
Paths to damnation
All evil shall prevail
Breaking bones tales
