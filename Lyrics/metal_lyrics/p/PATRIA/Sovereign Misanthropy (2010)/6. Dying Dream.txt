Pain eyes
Seeing old paths
Covered by darkness
Shinning only by the moonlight

Forgotten sanctuary
House of pagan spirits
Abandoned man

Trees so old
Smelling like the ancient times

Stones covered by blood
Drenched in the darkest battles
The mist cover souls as a mantle
Resting in middle of the frozen forests
