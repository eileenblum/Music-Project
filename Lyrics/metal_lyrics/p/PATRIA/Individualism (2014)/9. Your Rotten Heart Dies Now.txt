You should try my somber destiny
To see through the eyes of death
Beyond the gates of illusion

Even the dead can suffer
Surrounded by a deep grief
You are rotting as the faithâ¦ as the faith!!!

The night calls you
Freezing your bones
In an eternal winter
An innocent spirit, pale, shattered
Like a trophy made of ice

I spit on your white grave
While you pray for eternal life
Your tears are ignored
No beliefs, no gods
Just miseryâ¦ misery!!!

Thousand demons laughing so loud,
Deafening your soul
Your rotten heart dies now
