My soul is in flames
The essence of evil spirits
As a curse in thy name

Shadows moving slowly
Reaching the corners of life
Burning full moon
Almighty forces...
Hiding the twilight

Uncrowned god of light

Moments of affliction, eternal wrath!!!
Darkness brings peace to the pain
Building a constellation of agony

Shadows moving slowly
Reaching the corners of life
Burning full moon
Almighty forces...
Hiding the twilight

Uncrowned god of light

Drowned in the deepest sadness
Opening paths for a parallel dimension...
The dark night spectres are flying around
Tearing the decayed heaven
Piercing the angels hearts

The second sun
Ritualistic altar
Uncrowned god of light
