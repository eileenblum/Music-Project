Beyond the moonlight
Pale unholy beauty
Empty aura and heart pierced by anguish
Misery of life, consumed by the cosmic dust

The mirrors reflect the pain in my eyes
An abyss of suffering and solitude
A journey to the endless chaos

Blood storm prophecy

Darkness heals my soul
Taking me into the arms of death
When I listen a blood storm tearing the sky
It's my funeral, my own prophecy!

In the darkness I finally found my home
Where numbness yearning
For my already forgotten spirit

Blood storm prophecy

The mirrors reflect the pain in my eyes
An abyss of suffering and solitude
A journey to the endless chaos
