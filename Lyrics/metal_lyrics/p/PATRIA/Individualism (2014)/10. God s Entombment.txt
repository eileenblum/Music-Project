Hear the trumpets
That's the end
Vast darkness
Swallowing life
Consuming souls

Destroyed sacred symbols
Ruining the sacristy
While demons fly around the sun
Usurping all light

Winds blow
Inhabited by ancient shadows
Carrying dementia
Rage and murder

Gushing christian blood
Godâs entombment

Unexpected death
Surrounded by lost spirits
Painting the horizon in black
Antichrist's storm
Universal damnation

Destroyed sacred symbols
Ruining the sacristy
While demons fly around the sun
Usurping all light

Oh the fervor of victory
My real throne
All condemned
To an endless solitude
