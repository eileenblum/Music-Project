Absolute inexistence
Walking through the edge of madness
Followed by the shadows of a troubled mind
Dragging chains through the dark paths

Inhabited by old trees... Dry and grey...
The icy winds blow
Making hearts freeze

The fog hangs...
Bringing the endless grief
To a life destined to suffering

Catharsis
Taking them to the death
Catharsis
Purifying souls

Walking through the edge of madness
Followed by the shadows of a troubled mind

Catharsis
Taking them to the death
Catharsis
Purifying souls

Lights out
Lost, walking in circles
In silence, decoding darkness
Whispering delusion hymns
Like wolves crawling to the abyss
