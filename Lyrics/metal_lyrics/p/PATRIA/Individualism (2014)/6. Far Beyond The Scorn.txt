Red clouds painting the sky
Prelude to the suicide
Agonizing cries
Where the light dims the subconscious
In a mental purgatory
Unholy forest
Bringing voices from the past
Guiding me to the ceremonial circle

Duality, inversion
Blasphemy, desireâ¦

Faith, the enemy of reason
Wasted by false moral
In a social alienation
Sarcastic illusion

There is not a kingdom of heaven
Not even in your dreams
You are all stunned
Still doped by your own failure

There is no truth
Just cosmic dust wandering randomly
Instinct, savagery

Glory to the night of the nights
Queen of despair
Anthem of individuality
Forged by the mighty mist

I am far beyond the scorn
I am devouring heartsâ¦ hearts!!!

Faith, the enemy of reason
Wasted by false moral
I am far beyond the scornâ¦scorn!!!
