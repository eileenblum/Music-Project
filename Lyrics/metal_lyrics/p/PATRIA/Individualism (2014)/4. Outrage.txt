No one witnessed
What was going to happen
Time and space simply doesn't exist
Immeasurable, intertwined

Suddenly a tremor
A new order was born
Darkness, the past has now turned
Starting a powerful march of fire

Matter, the universe
The first cause, anti-genesis
Asymmetry, the mystery of light
The beautiful imperfection, hiding the code of nature

The dance of the universe
Outrage, spreading destruction and revolt
Insulting the monotheistic reign
Empty words and thoughts
Making room to the doomsday of heaven and earth

Matter, the universe
The first cause, anti-genesis
Asymmetry, the mystery of light
The beautiful imperfectionâ¦

No one witnessed
What was going to happen
Time and space simply doesn't exist
