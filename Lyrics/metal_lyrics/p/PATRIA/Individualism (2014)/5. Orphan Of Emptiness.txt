A pair of alive bright eyes
Are the windows of a huge and desert world
A king alone in an empty empire
Little soul of loneliness and madness

Being surrounded but living alone.
Don't see anyone and be watched by all.
It's a twisted and meaningless smile.
That hide your fears and obsessions.

Orphan of emptiness

Each whisper is a storm in my mind
Each touch is like a razors in the flesh
Each point of light is like the death
Of a thousand stars
And every tear I shed
Have the taste of thousand deaths
Mandatory misanthropy
Or sick individualism?

Where the creation has failed
Or where the will triumphed?

A prison without walls
Or a hermetic world?
To give wings to madness
Or to give madness to senses?
