The Darkness Of Night
Falls like Tears
Red Spotting The Sky

The Majestic Moon
Bring Us The Mysteries
From the past conquests
Memorable Remembrance

The Winds blow on the bodies
Surrounded by the Pagan Souls
The Valleys show
The forgotten darkness by time

Misanthrope Spirits
Round the mountains
Over their lands

In the middle of the forests
Forgotten Warriors
Dancing their War Hymns

Misanthrope Spirits
