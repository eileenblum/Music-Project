In front of darkness legion,
I kneel myself in honor to the ancient
I compel to be free without fear

I hold the knife of the inequality,
Ready to attack and destroy
Defending my throne,
Dirty, dark and shady.

Blood sneezing on behalf of god
Flesh cut in sacrifice to him

Rise the Supremacy of Darkness
Where your blood will reign eternally
Hold the steel and believe in Death
Then I introduce you, your real Patria!!!

Carrying the slaves to the suicide
No peace, Emptiness!
I fight for becomes me immortal
Glory of which never I will forget

I am who command the nature
I am who spread the terror
Powerful Hatred against empty Love
Humiliation, Shame! Destruction!

Rise the Supremacy of Darkness
Where your blood will reign eternally
Hold the steel and believe in Death
Then I introduce you, your real Patria!!!
