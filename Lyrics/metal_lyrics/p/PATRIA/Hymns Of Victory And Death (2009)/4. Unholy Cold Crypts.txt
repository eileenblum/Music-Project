Into the dark skies
Secret rites and Mysticism
Burning the stupid holy cross
I see the unholy cold crypts

Sorrow grim of Black storms
Darkness marches through the coldest night
The mist surrounding the empire's horizon
This is the call of death plague
Call Of Death

Sacrifice the earth
Red rivers are passing
Through the soul divine
burning all sheep
Everything In flames and chaos!!!

Winds smells like old blood
Voices guides you to a final command
The iron magnetizing everything
Swords we rise, Swords we down

Surrounding by old nature
We acclaim for the battle
Death! The empire of the third circle
is now complete in honor

We'll die stand before any god
Living in Darkness
Our souls are condemned
To the end
