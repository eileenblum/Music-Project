In the realm of divinity
Insignificant existences
A secret sanctuary
Stained in pure blood

Older than immortality
I feel the veil of darkness
In ruins
Upside down

I can not touch
The eternal sorrow
Through the eyes filled with honor
An abysmal paradise

Immortal Hate

Everlasting Death Circle
Monument of nature sonority
Battle forest grow
Sons of the moon

Vein of eternity
Comprehensive darkness
The Somber Supreme
Awakening at the night

Forgotten tales
Darkness treasures
Revival
Falling eternally

Immortal Hate
