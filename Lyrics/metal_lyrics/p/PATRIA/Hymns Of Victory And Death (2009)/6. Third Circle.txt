Sinister Visions
Obscure origins of humanity
Reign of the magicians
Pagan Old Legends

Silence!
The mortal poison goes from before
the rising of macabre dawn
Strong arms will soon throw down the chains

I'm the Darkness!
Winds bring the black clouds
Engraved ancient signs
I will protect this land

With hammers and swords
For you I shall slay!
Grayness in my eyes
The days shall be endless

Listen the ode of Hatred
Blood from the scars
Spell of the damned ones!
Incantations written in blood

The silence, fog, ritual
Spirits hidden in the forest
Worshipping the darkness
Under the sign of three circles
