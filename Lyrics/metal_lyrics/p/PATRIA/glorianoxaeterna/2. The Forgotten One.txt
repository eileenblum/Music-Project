Unleash the ancient paths
Eternally through a nightmare
A quiet place... Dirty! Unknown!

Hidden in the woods
Forgotten by life spirit
The pain of liberation!
Ingratitude!

Obscure Flames
Whispers of Death
Domination and Agony!

Thoughts to the winds
Reaching the meaning of the end
Remembering the chaos
Spreading hate

Under the grey sky
Hunger eyes, flying crows
Empty, with no feeling

The Forgotten One
Enchanted by the beauty of Darkness
Surrounded by the eternal misanthropy
