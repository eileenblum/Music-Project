Dream with the darkness
Whispering cold, breaking the silence
Anger invades the pestilence inside me
Worshiping the cult of shadows

My eyes see the death's scythe
A frozen horror surviving in my mind

The eyes of anguish
Suffering through my dark face
Creeping through the hole in my heart

Aloneness, Evil, cold
Shattered my soul

There's no return
The seeds of the miserable god
Winter Desert Night
Reigning terror

Mantus â Guitars, Bass, Drums
