In my veins runs passion
For a lot of things
Without it I canât wake up every morning

My hobbies are simple,
I like to fuck, I like to smoke
But my passion is music
Thanks to her we meet real bands, real people
Weâre on the road with them

Living human adventures
Feeling the power of the pits
Sharing feelings with people 
Together weâre alive

In my veins, in my veins

Smile at women, enjoy life
Enjoy it to the full!
Donât want to feel regret, 
Itâs in our veins

In my veins, itâs in my veins
In my veins, itâs in my veins
In my veins, itâs in my veins
In my veins, itâs in

In my heart it feels like that
In my veins runs this passion
Run to your destiny
Sheâll take you as a, as her son, as her son, run, run!

Living human adventures
Feeling the power of the pits
Sharing feelings with people 
Together weâre alive

IN MY VEINS
