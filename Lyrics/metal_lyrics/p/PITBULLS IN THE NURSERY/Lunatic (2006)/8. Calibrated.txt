Youâre young, ambitious, ready to be,
Sacrificed cos they need profits and audience

You want to be a star!
To dance, to sing, and be cute
You want to see everyone singing this song
Thatâs so easy to remember

Calibratedâ¦Is your music!

And now youâre a star, so famous, idolized, itâs groovy for you!

Youâre part of show business
The star system, your family, until your fall!

You realize one day!
They donât care about you!
The time has come for their next glove puppet star
To replace you!

Calibratedâ¦Is your fate!

And now youâre a star, so famous, idolized, itâs groovy for you!

Youâre part of the show business
The star system, your family, until your fall!
Justify our expense

One year later youâre anonymous
A new chance for you to live your life!
