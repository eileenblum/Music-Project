It's the story of a man who seeks for
Some kind of weapons
He knows that,
We know that,
He wants to justify his war

A new kind of war was born
To make it you don't need any reasons
Just make some accusations
Without proof

You say he has many massive destruction weapons
But where are they? Cos you don't find them!
We don't need more blood for oil!

Hey you, we don't need no more blood for oil
Hey you, we don't need that at all
We don't need no more blood for oil
We don't need that at all

Don't need more blood for oil
Your dream to create your own world will be our future nightmare

A new kind of war was born
To make it you don't need any reasons
Just make some accusations
Without proof
You think, you think
You are the cop of the world
I think you are just a bouncer

Don't need more blood for oil
Your dream to create your own world will be our future nightmare

I hope your nation sees you as you are:
"At the polling day, guy, watch the countdown!"

We don't need no more blood for oil
We don't need no more
We don't need no more blood for oil
We don't need that!
