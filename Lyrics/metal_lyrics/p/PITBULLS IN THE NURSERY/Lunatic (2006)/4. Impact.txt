Your velocity is nothing compared to my ferocity
I will crush you
I will crush you, I hate you thatâs why I do that
Let the impact come in your face
Let the impact come!

It will come with us cos youâre the one we overthrow,
You, dictator are defeated cos  masses must lead,

Impact

Donât look for friends, now there is no rest for you
Iâm disgusted with the thing youâre able to do!

It will come with us cos youâre the one we overthrow,
You, dictator are defeated cos  masses must lead,

Impact

Iâm sick cos you live
Youâd better commit suicide
Come and see the impact
That leads you to death

I fuck you, I want you to die
It will free our minds
Come and see the impact
That leads us to death
