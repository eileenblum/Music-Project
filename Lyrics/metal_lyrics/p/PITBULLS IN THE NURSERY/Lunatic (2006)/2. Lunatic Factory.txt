Tryin' to understand - what do
They expect from me?
To feel better?
Or do they want to spy on me?

Yes I'm sick
Take care of me!
I eat the pills
They bring to me!

I am a bit paranoid:
"It's all in your mind," says the doctor
But I don't feel so good yet,
Just a product of the factory

When I look at the world,
I think I'm similar
Deranged, deranged, deranged, Why?

Too much pollution, too many political lies
Not enough food for everybody, too many fanatics

I spend my days in my dreams
I'm waiting for you to wake up!

I am a bit pessimistic
Not so severe say humans
But I feel treated so badly
Just a victim of the factory
