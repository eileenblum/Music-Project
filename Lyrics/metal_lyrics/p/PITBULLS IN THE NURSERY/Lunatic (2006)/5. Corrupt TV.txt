What is this mess?
Everyday we can see the same shows

Insecurity
Drug-addicts
Oppress you
When you watch TV you see them
Revolted, stoned

Theyâre all around you! They want you guy!
Theyâre all around you, they want you
TV said: âAt the elections make the right choiceâ
Theyâre all around you, they want you

I am insane do you know who I am?
I am the one, who makes the day
I am insane do you know who I am?
I am the one who plays with the truth
