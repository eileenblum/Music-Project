[Solo: Gunsen]

Come, let me feel Your breath,
Whatever stars will sayâ¦
Whatever happens thenâ¦

Come, I wish to taste Your tears,
In one untouchable kiss,
Devoid of any sins.

Never try to touch my shiny skin,
Never wish to uncover my dreams!!

A stone of Your heart seeks revenge,
I feel it very wellâ¦
Whatever Iâd like to changeâ¦

My hate, I fed it everyday,
You share with me my way and my painâ¦

Iâm the flame and You are my shining star,
Iâm so close, but You are still so far!!

Undiscovered dreams, undiscovered feelingsâ land,
Thousands nights from here we still crave for love and hateâ¦

You are my star!!
Iâm priestess of the moon.
And I owe You my life forever!!
Someday we will find this word, that they called the love.

In another space, in another time â somewhere!!

Undiscovered dreams, undiscovered feelingsâ land,
Someday our dreams will come true and will be free.

[Solo: Gunsen]

Thousands miles from here we still believe in love without hate,
But not yetâ¦

[Violin: M. Jelonek]
