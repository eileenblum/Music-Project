[Solo: K.Mania/Gunsen]

Beyond the real world of pain-filled screams,
A chant of wolves, that calls my name
In a depth of black abyss, where I follow my dreams,
Little spark falls downâ¦ and itâs closer nowâ¦

Earthquake and starlight have shrouded this land,
Until I open my eyes.
Itâs time for an alliance letâs find our star
We are running ahead, we are passing the death,
We will rule as forever again and againâ¦

Stardust raised by the wind, guides the way through the silver flames!
Salvation from heaven, destiny from the stars!
Weâre rising our force of will for the fight which lasts forever.
Searching the way to the promised gatesâ¦

The earth became a cradle for the dust from this star,
Did you hear the almighty now?
Light is so blinding, this star used to shine.
Now I am running ahead, I am cheating the death,
No one will ever stop the ancient curse of this land!

Stardust raised by the wind, guides the way through the silver flames!
Salvation from heaven, destiny from the stars!
Weâre rising our force of will for the fight which lasts forever.
Searching the way to the promised gatesâ¦

And now Iâm standing without any fear,
The stardust raised with my power of will.
Iâm here to know the sense of transcendental fight,
Beyond the space, beyond the time,
Beyond the unexplored brink of my mind!

Beyond the real world of pain-filled screams,
A chant of wolves, that calls my name
In a depth of black abyss, where I follow my dreams,
Little spark falls downâ¦ and itâs closer nowâ¦
