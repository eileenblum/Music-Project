Somewhere amid boundless seas,
A lament of wind spreads the sails higher and higher.
Through the all sleepless nights, our hearts strain to find,
The Guardians of Immortal Fire.
The fury of storm, the thundercloudâs war,
Threw our ship into the battle.
The dolphinâs escort and their magic song,
Will take us to the line of the shore!

Flames â elements of fire,
Burn on my hand in never ending dance of blaze,
Fight â eternal desire,
Burns in my veins to the end of my days!

Demons of night call my name,
Through the storms,
By the thunders and roars of the wind
The bright shining star at night
Guide the course, where nobody returns,
Where The Legend of Immortal Fire burns!!

On the horizon so far, at sunrise so dark,
A fog reveals land from the shadows.
If the lore isnât a lie, demons there never die,
But they test the spells of my sword.
Forever weâll be free, forever weâll live,
The one who touches the immortal flame.
Weâll reach the goal, with rage of the shore
With the power to fighting the guardians of

Flames â elements of fire,
Burn on my hand in never ending dance of blaze,
Fight â eternal desire,
Burns in my veins to the end of my days!

Demons of night call my name,
Through the storms,
By the thunders and roars of the wind
The bright shining star at night
Guide the course, where nobody returns,
Where The Legend of Immortal Fire burns!!
