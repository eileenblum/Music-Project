Dead silence in my court, contrasts with dead screams
In my mind and soul.
Life is too short, so let us love people now, they leave so fast!!

Over all the Mornings of the World,
In silence, deep inside my heart Iâll remember You,
And every sunrise that awakens a new day,
Makes me closer to Your heaven far away.

Only tears of goodbyeâ¦ in the stream of fading
Memories it play my last requiem,
Not asking why, I swear to turn my judgement day
Into a bloody revenge!!

Over all the Mornings of the World,
In silence, deep inside my heart Iâll remember You,
And every sunrise that awakens a new day,
Makes me closer to Your heaven far away.

Over all the Mornings of the World,
In silence, deep inside my heart Iâll remember You,
And every sunrise that awakens a new day,
Makes me closer to Your heaven far away.
