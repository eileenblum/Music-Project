Your life belongs to me! â Whose voice speak inside me?
Iâm your destination! â Tell it to your bastards!
Demon! Back to the hell! Godforsaken Angel!
Youâll never taste the freedom! Try to kill me a second timeâ¦

I will follow my way, where the starlight
Of heaven sweetens my eternal dreamâ¦
â¦so aloneâ¦ but I donât need an escape â Iâm starting the journey,
which appeared to me in an oracleâs prophecy!!

ââ¦Find the name of god, who lets you die,
([Choir:] Find the name of god, Find the truth of life)
Burn unholy signs, a temple of lie!
([Choir:] Find the name of god, burn unholy signs)
Fly on wings of destination,
Where the shadows from the past recall your mortality!â

Your Kingdom will be mine now! â I will return and find you!
A thousand flames from heaven burn my land!

The journey of the marshland where the oracleâs eye,
Itâs knowledge of immortal wisdom tells me what I am!

My life? What has happened to it?? I remember my death,
But am I a human still??
â¦But my fateâ¦ Iâll never see them again!
My brothers and sisters Iâll revenge your suffering, cries and death!

ââ¦Find the name of god, who lets you die,
([Choir:] Find the name of god, Find the truth of life)
Burn unholy signs, a temple of lie!
([Choir:] Find the name of god, burn unholy signs)
Fly on wings of destination,
Where the shadows from the past recall your mortality!â

The question of Your life is carved down on Your hand.
The answer deep inside Your heart needs time.
Beware!!
I will follow my way! Where the eye of oracle will show me
The direction of my destiny!

ââ¦Find the name of god, who lets you die,
([Choir:] Find the name of god, Find the truth of life)
Burn unholy signs, a temple of lie!
([Choir:] Find the name of god, burn unholy signs)
Fly on wings of destination,
Where the shadows from the past recall your mortality!â
