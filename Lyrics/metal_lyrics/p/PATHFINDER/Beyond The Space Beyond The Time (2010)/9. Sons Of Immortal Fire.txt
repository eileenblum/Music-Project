A smell of blood and stench of burning is rising over the fields...
A blood-red fog on the battle's landscape is an afterglow paint by the wind

I wanna die! This second time in a fatal fervor of fighting!
In the name of god, who changes the brightness of peace into repugnant nightmare of war!

Look at the sky and never give up the chance of fight!
Cause sons of fire disperse the clouds of night!
The enemy of mourning sunrise shall to know the green dragon's might!

Sons of Immortal Fire come flying
With hope of saving whole world!
The call of the wind spreads dragon's wings...
To the fiery battlecry!

Side by side and arm in arm we force the way through the pain...
The monsters of abyss charged by army of death, so scream to the gods if you can... yet!

It can be I'll die, but never give upâ¦
With the fight against the plagues of satan's horde!
With the fight against the evil brings a pain!
We will rise again!

Sons of Immortal Fire come flying
With hope of saving whole world!
The call of the wind spreads dragon's wings...
To the fiery battlecry!

Sons of Immortal Fire come flyingâ¦

Sons of Immortal Fire are coming
Our will is stronger than fear!
The dragonheart's rhythm resounds in our hearts,
For the harmony and peace of the world!
