With the speed of the light and the wind in my hair I ride,
Across the world of the night where an eternal darkness abducted and holds my lady-friend,
A troglodytes head rolled downâ¦
The lust of fight and the echo of cry kept me on this pathway of dark.

Celestial beauty of the sky above, not cooling down my rage,
A fearsome grim, not leaving my face. Fall in my disgrace!
The cave dwellers shall pay and revenge shall be mine,
No price is to high, for this what has been done â my fury leads my sword!

Fighting with forces of chaos, the sacrifice of blood has been never forget...

When an angel on a battlefield dies,
When a hero surrenders and cries,
The horde of wolves will be fighting for the freedom of all,
Who deserved eternal friendship of Lord Of Wolves.

The darkness of infernal cave stifled the fire of my torch,
Like a blind man I searched the path, the eyes of a wolf were my eyes.
The jaws crushed a slimy limbs, effectively cleaned the way,
ââ¦I believe itâs not too late, weâll not go astray!!â

When an angel on a battlefield dies,
When a hero surrenders and cries,
The horde of wolves will be fighting for the freedom of all,
Who deserved eternal friendship of Lord Of Wolves.

Fighting with forces of chaos, the sacrifice of blood has been never forget...
Fortune let find her, I don't believe!! A tattoo like my stopped to shine!!

When an angel on a battlefield dies,
When a hero surrenders and cries,
The horde of wolves will be fighting for the freedom of all,
Who deserved eternal friendship of Lord Of Wolves.
