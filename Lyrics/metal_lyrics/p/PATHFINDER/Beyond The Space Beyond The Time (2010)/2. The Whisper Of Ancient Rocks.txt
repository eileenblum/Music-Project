Across the ancient rocks, where the wind of Winter's Heart whispers:
âYou' ll be lost, you will die...â
The Winterstorm is here a landscape, that you'll never see
It's my kingdom, here's my fatherland

The waterfalls in the frozen embrace shows the power of winter,
Take the breath and relish the frost!
My father The King claimed that all around someday will be mine.
For the might of the Winter, Iâll be brave!!

People, dwarves and elves establish here the united kingdom,
Mountains, lakes and sky - the force of land where the freedom rules.
The nature is ally, is the power of cosmic creation,
The key to every life, the sun in day and the light in night.

Here's no cry!
Here's no pain,
But only the pride of nature and life,
Do you feel the touch of icy rainbow on your skin?
Here's no crime,
Here's no agony!
A wild pegasus flies there high on the sky.
Do you see? The nature is the master even beyond me.

But sometimes, when the stars are falling down, in my heart grow strange fillings...
Even, when the moon is fool I close my eyes and the nightmare is a beginning.
Demons of abyss disturb my mind!
Red eyes leak the blood... Iâm running behind!

Through the seven years on The Agareth â the highest mountain
Something evil brings a thawing snow!
An eternal frostland crossing by the streams of boiling lava!
Something evil killed the Holy Gryphs!

People, dwarves and elves establish here the united kingdom
Mountains, lakes and sky - the force of land where the freedom rules.
The nature is ally, is the power of cosmic creation!
The key to every life, the sun in day and the light in night...

Here's no cry!
Here's no pain,
But only the pride of nature and life,
Do you feel the touch of icy rainbow on your skin?
Here's no crime,
Here's no agony!
A wild pegasus flies there high on the sky.
Do you see? The nature is the master even beyond me.
