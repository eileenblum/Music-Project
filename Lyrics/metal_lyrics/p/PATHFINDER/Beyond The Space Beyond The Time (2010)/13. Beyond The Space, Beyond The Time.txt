Deep inside Iâm burning, sheâs flying with me,
Fly, fly to the dark horizon of my dreams,
The army of light is fighting together,
Fight, fight for the astral kingdom to the end.

[Solo: K.Mania/Gunsen]

My claws are tearing, my tusks are crashing,
The flames embraced the skies.
And there are no swords, that could force the huge scales of my armor.
I spit with sulfur, my fire is everywhere,
I know, thatâs the gift from the stars.
Now we are the six, the guardians of peace and the only Dragonlords!

Beware, my brave Dragonlord of the Yearnig Star!!
We can win, but the glory is so far!!
We have to fight for all astral planes and the dream is your domain.

Even in the far skies, I will cover you,
Even in your dark dreams, when you fight in, my magic be with you.
Even in the far land, I will cover you,
By the drawings on our hands, my magic be with you.

Two secrets in two hearts, one fire and one blood,
Two drawings on two hands, one reason for the fight.
One dream began the war, against the Shadow Lord,
One dream will end the gore and take the evil horde.
Sheâs singing to the stars, her voice rise many spells,
Sheâs speaking to the moon, her magic be with you,
Two secrets in two hearts, one fire and one blood,
Two drawings on two hands, one reason for the fight.

I got the power for repress my infinite hate, behind his eyes,
Under a white dragon shape.
My mental forces belong to an dreamâs astral plane,
But my claws and flames have the real name!!

We are beyond the space, beyond the time.
Where the dreams still meet a reality.
We are beyond the light, beyond the dark,
Where the space-time continuum has its end.

Dark shadows are fading and falling to abyss,
I know, the Black Lord rules them all.
And nothing is lost, as long as we gain an air supremacy.
The victory is coming! I feel it in my heart!
Weâre back to reconquer my land.
Now we are the six, the guardians of peace and the only Dragonlords!!

Fall into your darkest dreams,
Into your darkest nightmare find this god,
Which screams inside your mind!
And when youâll stand with him eye to eye,
Calm the heart and leave your rage behind!!

I got the power for repress my infinite hate, behind his eyes,
Under a white dragon shape.
My mental forces belong to an dreamâs astral plane,
But my claws and flames have the real name!!

- With every transcedental while, my astral dragons die!!
- Here nobody can help you!!
- My priestess calls a magic spell, the army flies ahead!!
- Ars magica ignis aeterni!!

We are beyond the space, beyond the time.
Where the dreams still meet a reality.
We are beyond the light, beyond the dark,
Where the space-time continuum and the wonder of life has its end.

I was the witness of your birth and deathâ¦
â¦and strictly speaking I was the reason of both!!
You will never escape from your destiny and that what you were.
Come my son, stop to dream and face the cruel reality!!

How could we grow stronger to ease endless grief,
How could we still wonder, weâre asking what ifâ¦

Beyond the space, beyond the time we are flying away,
Where the dreams still meet reality.
Weâre asking how could we grow stronger to ease endless grief.

We are guardians of all astral planes,
We are ighting to the end of all days.
Fight forever, even the sun is gone.
Might moonlight will not leave you alone!! Fight forever!!

- Ars magica ignis aeterni!!

Beyond the space, we beyond the time,
We are beyond the light and the dark.

We are beyond the space, beyond the time we are flying away,
Where the dreams still meet a reality.
We are beyond the light, beyond the dark,
Where the space-time continuum and the wonder of life has its end.
