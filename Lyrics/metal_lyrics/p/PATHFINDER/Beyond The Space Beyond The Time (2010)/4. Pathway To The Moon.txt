My heart bled out and pain set in,
When a lethal arrow hits me in the back...
The sorrow of leaving without farewell,
Draws bloody tears all down on my face...

Assassin's shadow approached me...
...I didn't feel anything... only the fall,
And there was someone, some divine being...
The mysterious guide of my leaving soul.

[Solo: K. Mania/Gunsen]

I've seen my life, through the eyes of the gods,
And visions of a black river running deep...
The Styx was cold as a vortex of sins,
The pentagram's circle depicted by rapid creek...

Suddenly I woke up!! I felt a wound!!
Mantra is calling me!!
Who has revived me?! Who gave me that brand?!

The darkness turned into light, when the revival spell went by
Her whisper to the nightly sun...
Secret wisdom, secret might
Of magic secrets signs.

Save our King!! The Master of our holy realm!
Give him Your light! The wonderful gift of life...
By the moonlight the magic glow surrounds my hand,
Mystical drawings entwines my arm, for the return of my land...
Now, the goddess of nightly sky becomes my life-giving sun!

I know what is your destiny, I know what is your life...
