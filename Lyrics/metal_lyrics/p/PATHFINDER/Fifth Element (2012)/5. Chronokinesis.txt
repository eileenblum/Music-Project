Upcoming vengeance is my nemesis,
Time stopped by chronokinesis,
The space in stillness is the slave of my will,
Fifth Element increased all mypsycho skills.

The line of foe is stopped and motionless,
The Vortex of abyss is the battlefield,
My mind's screams are fortified by metal!
But only waves of sadness always makes me weak.

Dragonlords scream for metal!
Dragonloards are calling metal!
The Black Lord knows our Achilles' heel.
Reject the sadness! Pessimism kills!

The left flank screaming for metal!
The right flank is calling metal!
A millionth army of soul thirsty demons,
Again is stopped in time.

...in silence surrounded by death and life,
The battle has stopped in space and time.

But our swords dance fast in chase of demon's hearts.
The dragon's blast down the evil's crowd.

ONCE AGAIN LET'S STOP WHEELS OF TIME
TO GET CLOSER TO VICTORY
ENERGY GROWS INSIDE OUR MINDS, SHAPED BY OUR WILL.
TIME SLOWS DOWN AND WE KEEP THE FIGHT ON THIS
FALLEN ASTRAL PLANE.
ENERGY EXPLODED STOPPING ALL AROUND, KILLING EVERYONE

The time has stopped for death and life!

Our astral dragons spit fireballs.
Metal unites my thoughts with their thoughts.
Demons die turned into demonic dust.
By our swords and the dragon's blast.

The Black Lord sends tragic visions from the past,
He tried to disturbed the order in my mind.
I know one day we'll have to move this war.
From this fallen dimension to the realtime world.

...in silence surrounded by death and life,
The battle has stopped in space and time.

But our swords dance fast in chase of demon's hearts.
The dragon's blast down the evil's crowd.

ONCE AGAIN LET'S STOP WHEELS OF TIME
TO GET CLOSER TO VICTORY
ENERGY GROWS INSIDE OUR MINDS, SHAPED BY OUR WILL.
TIME SLOWS DOWN AND WE KEEP THE FIGHT ON THIS
FALLEN ASTRAL PLANE.
ENERGY EXPLODED STOPPING ALL AROUND, KILLING EVERYONE.
EVERYONE!
