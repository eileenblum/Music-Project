Final attack!! With the furious warcry,
Every man, every dwarf, every elf fast charge!
Overwhelming demons chaotically start to strike,
Lets show them the evil of the light!

Lost in the fight I started the massacre,
My dragon's fire came down to the ground.
Legion of orcs die in the flames,
This is the evil! The evil is my name!

This rage inside me is constantly growing,
Every killed demon laugh in agony.
I know these words and remember that view.
When you look into an abyss, the abyss looks at you.

That was enough! I stopped the time!
Waves of mental strokes attackes my will.
Black Lord appeared in his demonic incarnation.
I heard him before only in my mind.

Ad futuram rei memoriam...
When I stopped the time, the wind still blew softly,
He dissappeared and left his army alone...

RUN AWAY ACROSS ALL FALLEN ASTRAL PLAINS,
WE BELIEVE IN METAL AS FIFTH ELEMENT.
WE'LL FIND YOU! RUN AWAY YOU COWARD! RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!
FLY MIGHTY CORPS OF DRAGONLORDS,
CONTROL TIME! REACH THE STAR OF UNICORN!
I LEAD THEM! FOLLOW ME! FOLLOW ME! FOLLOW ME!

Lost in the fight I started the massacre,
My dragon's fire came down to the ground.
Legion of orcish mutants die in the flames,
This is the evil! The evil is my name!

This rage inside me is constantly growing,
Every killed demon laugh in agony.
I know these words and remember that view.
When you look into an abyss, the abyss looks at you.
