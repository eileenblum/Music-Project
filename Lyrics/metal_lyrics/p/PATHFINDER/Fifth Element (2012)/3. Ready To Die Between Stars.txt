Find us in the darkness,
We're running rage and madness,,
Swords like sonic shadows,
We fight, we crash, we rule!

Falling into abyss
We found here what we promised,
The last hope for the kingdom,
Fifth Element for the world.

Metal is that power,
The victory will be ours,
When the sunrise lights the hell,
We'll rise! We'll rise to attack! We'll rise!

Metal is forever,
And unite us here together,
Metal is the pathway!
Let's rise, let's live this way!

We give you mental power,
Pure elemental wisdom,
Energy of destruction everywhere.

DEEP INSIDE OF OUR HEARTS BEAT SOUNDS OF HEAVY METAL
WE ARE READY TO DIE BETWEEN STARS.
JOIN THE ARMY OF LIGHT AND NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.
WE ARE READY TO STRIKE.

Cast the spell of water,
Cast the spell of earth,
Be ready for slaughter,
Metal to the death!

Burn with spells of fire,
Fly with spells of wind,
And you only will admire,
When the metal glain your will.

We give you mental power,
Pure elemental wisdom,
Energy of destruction everywhere.

DEEP INSIDE OF OUR HEARTS BEAT SOUNDS OF HEAVY METAL
WE ARE READY TO DIE BETWEEN STARS.
JOIN THE ARMY OF LIGHT AND NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.
WE ARE READY TO STRIKE.

Even in the far skies I will cover you,
By the drawings on our handy my magic be with you!

So you look into the darkness, 
You'll find the rage and madness.

We'll bring the light for the kingdom of lies with pure metal in our hearts.

I'll possess your mental power,
Taking the last breath in your final hour!

You'll fight you'll die! You will never touch the light,
Fifth Element brings the sun!

Join the army of light and never be forgotten!

DEEP INSIDE OF OUR HEARTS BEAT SOUNDS OF HEAVY METAL
WE ARE READY TO DIE BETWEEN STARS.
JOIN THE ARMY OF LIGHT AND NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.
WE ARE READY TO STRIKE.

METAL IS ETERNAL
LIKE EARTH, FIRE, WIND AND WATER
FIFTH ELEMENT IN THE SPACE-TIME
ULTRA POWER FOR MY BRAIN
