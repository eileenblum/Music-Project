You're lost! Beyond your fucking mind, beyond your fucking dreams your soul and world are mine. No! I'll crash you very soon forever by the call of Fifth Element.

The world is waiting for the rise, we're stronger every day by the blood of all battlefields. The flame of hope will never die until we will keep the might of Fifth Element in our hearts.

I call the wind!
By the whisper wild speels of the storm.
A tornado has come with the mighty dragon's roar.

I call the water!
By the magic dance of the rain.
I divide ocean's sees by the hydrokinetic scream.

I call the fire of hell!
By the power of immortal flame.
Which will burn in my veins till the end of all days.

I call the quake of earth,
By geokinetic waves.
An armaggedon is near, cause metal is calling my will!

METAL IS ETERNAL
LIKE EARTH, FIRE, WIND AND WATER
FIFTH ELEMENT IN THE SPACE-TIME
ULTRA POWER FOR MY BRAIN

METAL FEEDS MY FANTASY.
MAKES ME MASTER OF MY WILD DREAMS
LIKE EARTH, FIRE, WIND AND WATER
SUPER METAL ARMS MY WILL

You fool! I live inside your head. I live inside your mind.
My death will be your end!
Die! You lost beyond the space! You lost beyond the time!
Let's fight in the reality!

Metal shines on our steel,
we keep the metal all the time deep inside our hearts.
The art of metal brings the hope and glory,
like the sunshine brings the promise of new day.

I call the fire of hell!
By the power of immortal flame.
Which will burn in my veins till the end of all days.

I call the metal!
By the sacred spells of my will.
I'll never give up! I'll be always ready to fight!

Soon we'll cross the sphere of last pain,
Immortal life on dragon's spine.
And then we fall forever and once again.
Beyond the space, beyond the time.

Fly my army of stral planes.
To highest spheres of consciousness.
That's what you dream about,
that's what you're fighting till the death.
It will be soon crowned with success.

METAL IS ETERNAL
LIKE EARTH, FIRE, WIND AND WATER
FIFTH ELEMENT IN THE SPACE-TIME

LIKE EARTH, FIRE, WIND AND WATER

...and when we'll cross the sphere of last pain,
Beyond the space, beyond the time...we'll get back life...
