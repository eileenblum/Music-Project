There will be no more days like this one,
No simple kiss!
All the moments already gone now,
Will remind you art of this myst!

Sands of time are unstoppable. Let river flow!
Fifth Element in our hearts,
It will not leave you alone!

Greetings and welcome to the other side of mirror...
Stand up you fool! Keep your head up high!
One day Iâll catch you on the other side of mirror...
Itâs not your way! You will never die!

AS THE WIND OF COSMOS WEâRE EXPLORING ALL DIMENSIONS,
AS THE FIRE WE SPREAD DESTRUCTION,
AS THE EARTH AND METAL OUR WILL PERSIST FOREVER,
AS THE WATER WE KEEP THE LIFE!

Our days are like old good times,
They come and go!
Thereâs no way to stop the curse.
In last moments we are all alone!

There are no more stars on sky!
Thatâs just bright light...
It was sent million years ago,
From beyond the space, beyond the time!

Greetings and welcome to the other side of mirror...
Stand up you fool! Keep your head up high!
One day Iâll catch you on the other side of mirror...
Itâs not your way! You will never die!

AS THE WIND OF COSMOS WEâRE EXPLORING ALL DIMENSIONS,
AS THE FIRE WE SPREAD DESTRUCTION,
AS THE EARTH AND METAL OUR WILL PERSIST FOREVER,
AS THE WATER WE KEEP THE LIFE!
