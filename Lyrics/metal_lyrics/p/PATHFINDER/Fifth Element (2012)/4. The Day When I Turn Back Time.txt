We are the storm,
We fight to the end.
We bring the light to forgotten dreams.
So come and join the army of lights,
We have to turn back time!

The day when I turn back time...

We crossed the gate,
We touched the light,
We saw the nothingness,
So many times!

We felt the space,
All astral planes,
We stopped the time.

Iâm leaving the hell,
And holy metal guids my sword.
My army appears from the storm!
Fly there with me,
Iâll show you how we keep on fighting.
Iâll show you how wide is the dream on dragonâs wings!

IN THE DAY WHEN YOU LOST MY SMILE,
I CROSSED IN SORROW GATES OF SPACE AND TIME.
TO CHANGE ALL THOSE THINGS WEâVE DONE,
THAT WAS LAST DAY WHEN I SAW THE LAST RAY OF SUN.

CRY FOR MY ANGER,
THR PRIDE IS YOUR SHELTER.
WE CHOSE OUR DAYS IN WRONG SPACE, AT WRONG TIME.
AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH EVERYTHING IS BEHIND,
WHEN YOUR LIFE IS LIKE YOUR BATTLEFIELD.

We still believe,
We keep the fight,
We are the gods of our life.

Iâm leaving the hell,
And holy metal guids my sword.
My army appears from the storm!
Fly there with me,
Iâll show you how we keep on fighting.
Iâll show you how wide is the dream on dragonâs wings!

IN THE DAY WHEN YOU LOST MY SMILE,
I CROSSED IN SORROW GATES OF SPACE AND TIME.
TO CHANGE ALL THOSE THINGS WEâVE DONE,
THAT WAS LAST DAY WHEN I SAW THE LAST RAY OF SUN.

CRY FOR MY ANGER,
THR PRIDE IS YOUR SHELTER.
WE CHOSE OUR DAYS IN WRONG SPACE, AT WRONG TIME.
AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH EVERYTHING IS BEHIND,
WHEN YOUR LIFE IS LIKE YOUR BATTLEFIELD.

We are the storm,
We fight to the end.
We bring the light to forgotten dreams.
So come and join the army of lights,
We have to turn back time!

IN THE DAY WHEN YOU LOST MY SMILE,
I CROSSED IN SORROW GATES OF SPACE AND TIME.
TO CHANGE ALL THOSE THINGS WEâVE DONE,
THAT WAS LAST DAY WHEN I SAW THE LAST RAY OF SUN.
