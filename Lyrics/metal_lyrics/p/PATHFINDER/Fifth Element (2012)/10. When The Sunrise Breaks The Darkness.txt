Through the storm of dust we're flying,
Magic waves of wind and the crashed enemies far behind.
Nothing can stop us now, cause we lust for the final fight.
High above the the infernal ground the night turns into a dawn.

The snow starts falling in abyss as the triumph of magic storm,
Our army of dragons in abyssal skies spreads the terror in enemy lines.
Run away you cowards!! Demons die by our flames,
We'll return with our glory, but another battle is straight ahead.

In Bellonae hortis nascunter semina mortis!
By the power of death I leave your mind, but we will meet soon in another time!
Vita since libertate nihil est!
I lost this battle, but the war will be my!
The same like you I'm immortal one!

WHEN THE SUNRISE BREAKS THE DARKNESS,
WE RISE OUR DRAGONS FOR FLIGHT TO THE SUN!
THE SUNRISE TOOK ALL SHADOWS
AND WE FLY FAR AWAY FIGHTING FOR THE REALITY!
SOON WE'LL REACH OUR DIMENSION,
WE KNOW NOTHING WILL BE THE SAME ANYMORE,
BUT SOMEDAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO BRING
THE PEACE FOR THE WORLD,
FOR THE WORLD OF HUMANS, ELVES AND DWARVES!

I'm watching a planet named Earth,
Million dimensions far from me,
Through my black raven eyes.
The stupid human race lives there so greedy for gold.
So I conquer with ease that world.

They will worship me, fuck and reproduce mutants for me.
My army will grow so fast.
Illnes and plagues, torture and blight.
These will be my tools of reign.

We will find you wherever you hide.
In every macro or micro worlds.
We will comb through every dimensions,
Whatever you do, you will be stopped.

In Bellonae hortis nascunter semina mortis!
By the power of death I leave your mind,
But we will meet soon in another time!
Vita since libertate nihil est!
I lost this battle, but the war will be my!
The same like you I'm immortal one!

WHEN THE SUNRISE BREAKS THE DARKNESS,
WE RISE OUR DRAGONS FOR FLIGHT TO THE SUN!
THE SUNRISE TOOK ALL SHADOWS
AND WE FLY FAR AWAY FIGHTING FOR THE REALITY!
AND METAL IS ETERNAL!
WE SING HOLY ANTHEMS FOR FIFTH ELEMENT!
YES, METAL IS ETERNAL!
LIKE THE SPACE-TIME BETWEEN STARS!
LIKE EARTH, FIRE, WATER AND WIND!
FIFTH ELEMENT!
