FORWARD MARCH! MARCH TO THE DARKEST HORIZON,
WE WILL START THE REBEL THE UNIVERSE,
IS WAITING FOR STORM!
FIGHT! FIGHT FOR THE DREAMS OF IMMORTALS,
WE WILL CRUSH TOGETHER THE INFERNAL
HORDES OF BLOODY LORD!

FORWARD MARCH! MARCH TO
THE PORTAL OF DARKNESS,
WE DENY THE HEAVENS â THE GODS STILL
ASK FOR MORE BLOOD.
FIGHT! FIGHT WITH YOUR SWORD AND PURE MAGIC,
NEVER SHOW YOUR MERCY ! NO PITY,
NO TEARS ON BATTLEFIELDS.

In this ominous moment of silence, I cast the last spell on my sword...
Kill them for me!
The bloody spell of berserker's dance!
March to the gate of hell where the fight is the chance.

They'll appear from dark mists and the fear helps them fast to resists.
So let's march there side by sidewith metal which flow from our hearts.

Follow me, the army of immortal fire! Ride with the dragonlords and gryphon riders!
Follow me now!
March to the infernal gate!
Every creature, every man be ready with your magic, claws and swords,
The battle has begun!

That what you hear when they die, is the last fucking breath of his lie!
A demon's dust on my sword bringts the relief for my soul!

And the wind brought the storm,
The water heals all wounds.
The enemy burns from the magic of fire!
An earthquake's spell shakes the ground and the lava plunged the foes.
And metal united us all to win this war!

FORWARD MARCH! MARCH TO THE DARKEST HORIZON,
