Haunting the black with our echoes
Waiting to show the unseen
Our world is dying, so sooner or later
Answers must come from the sky

Sending out lies to the darkness
Stories of peace all around
Why don't we know that the hate we bestow
On ourselves, its what's keeping us down

Dive down in the unknown
Find just how close we are
To worlds we'd like to know
Up between the stars

Out of the blue there are coming
Species from our dreams beyond
Not uninvited. So why are you crying
Knowledge is taking its all

Dive down in the unknown
Find just how close we are
To worlds we'd like to know
Up between the stars

[solo]

Dive down in the unknown,
find just how close we are
To worlds we'd like to know,
up between the stars..
Dive down in the unknown,
find just how close we are
Don't you want to know
Time for me to show
