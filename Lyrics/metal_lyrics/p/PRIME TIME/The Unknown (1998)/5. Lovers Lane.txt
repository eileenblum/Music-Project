Face down heading south rock 'n' roll has knocked me out
Don't you want a piece of it
Freedom in my sight having money overnight
I don't need a medal

I want the truth from you 'cause you don't want to live like this
Ain't got no lies for you 'cause you're not gonna get it
When the night time comes my way

Stay down the monster's out
Cruisin' down lovers lane
First light, non to gain
It's had it's taste of lovin'

Next town, wedding gown, so you think you'll break me down
Tears ain't gonna steal my way
Freedom in my sight, other cities, other nights
I don't need to medal

Ain't gonna cry for you, you're not gonna live like this
Ain't gonna cry for you, so baby you can kiss it
When the night time comes my way

Stay down the monster's out
Cruisin' down lovers lane
First light, non to gain
It's had it's taste of lovin'
Face down, over and out
Heading down lovers lane
First out till the morning comes
I've had my taste of lovin'

[solo]

Stay down the monster's out
Cruisin' down lovers lane...
