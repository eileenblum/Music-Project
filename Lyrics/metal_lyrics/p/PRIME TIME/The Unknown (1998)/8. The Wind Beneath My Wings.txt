Not one thing can seem to brake it
This emptiness I'm in, so deep
Find a key to open stairways
To long forgotten dreams
Straight to where I gaze

Light the fire we use to share
Melt our hearts to one, I dare take the step we use to fear
Spread your wings and come my way
Like a distant other day
Sense the love and joy it brings

Lifelessly awake
I wonder if shadows use to wear your face
Hand on heart I make this promise:
"Before the daylight comes, I'll be on my way"

Light the fire we use to share
Melt our hearts to one, I dare take the step we use to fear
Spread your wings and come my way
Like a distant other day
Sense the love and joy it brings

[solo]

Light the fire we use to share...
