You see shadows up ahead
I know darkness grows in the hearts of the sad
Take hold, light up all days you're still to have
By then you're on the way

Don't you feel the rush
Life, a line to cross
Don't you see it shine
Living on a borrowed time

Hesitation in your soul
Loose it, greatness lives in the ones that want it all
Express happiness when trouble comes your way
Better live it day by day

Don't you feel the rush
Life, a line to cross
Don't you see it shine
Living on a borrowed time

Time to love or leave it
There's a bad moon up tonight
You better live it up:

[solo]

Don't you feel the rush
