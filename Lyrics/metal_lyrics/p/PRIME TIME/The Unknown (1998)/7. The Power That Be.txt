I walked a road I never walked before
Like dancing down a straight road down the spiral
Walk the rope
Faithless and tired by blind denial

I use to wire pride on to my name
But recently I found I'm not that shiny
Smell the rain
Seasons are changing, time of the brave

Is this my faith I'm finding
Unleashed, no silver lining
We spent a life time praying
Until the darkness sets us free... To powers that be

So here it is, you suckers final stand
The dice about to roll, the bullet's flying
Chances die
Stood the decision, scenes fade away

Is it my faith I'm finding
Unleashed, no silver lining
We spent a life time praying
Until the darkness sets us free: To powers that be

[solo]

Seasons are changing
