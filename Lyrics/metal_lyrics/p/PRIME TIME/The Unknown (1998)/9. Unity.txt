I have these dreams, they tell me all
I need to... I need to know, if I can call on you for
Compassion, discretion, financial thrill

So it seems that I understand your sins and needs

So put your trust I me
Desperation makes your soul scream out
Silence comes to me
How your hearts all bleed for unity

Sunrise, woke with total view
So it would be wise to have some faith in me
For your wishing, submitting, equality

So my face, it reflects all your lies
Well just in case

So put your trust I me
Desperation makes your soul scream out
Silence comes to me
How your hearts all bleed for unity

[solo]

Play the game, I'm holding the cards
I live in pain

So put your trust in me...
