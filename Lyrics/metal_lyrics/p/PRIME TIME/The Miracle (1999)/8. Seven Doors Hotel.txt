Fourhundred years back in this time
Seven doors hotel
A massacre took place and a young man died
Opened on gate to hell

The Eibon is open use your eyes
To read and learn
In the end it could be your turn

1981 traces were found
That could not exist in one's mind
A woman could lead you totally deceive you
Without your knowing she's blind

Seven doors hotel
One of seven gates to hell
Seven doors hotel
One of seven gates to hell

Do always watch out for things
That you see but don't understand
The devil is there always somewhere
Ready to command
