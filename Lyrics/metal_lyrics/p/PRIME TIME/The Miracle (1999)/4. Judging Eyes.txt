Cold desserts burn like swallowed rats
Face down in irony
Inventive horror binding lust to vanity
My judging eyes...

Like thrown off branches, crumbled, dry,
So lie the penalized
Like freaks of nature cornered by our judging eyes
My judging eyes...

How can we break through
See the things like we suppose to
Are we afraid to look with our heart opened wide

The pounding of a different drum
Slides in and out of you
The holy virus, forced and fed by violent thrusts
My judging eyes...

How can we break through
See the things like we suppose to
Are we afraid to look with our heart opened wide
My judging eyes; closing door
Your judging eyes; close it some more on me...
Our judging eyes; block out all rights
Judging eyes
