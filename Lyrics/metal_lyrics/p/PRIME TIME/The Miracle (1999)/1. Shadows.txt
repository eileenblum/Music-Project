Roaming the nation, freedom ringing in my head
My celebration will be in a strangers bed

Slaving at night time, life is such a bitch
It seems that loving is my crime
That's the way it's got to be...

When your shadows wears my name
When the darkness falls, the silence grows
within a heartbeat
When your shadows wears my name
On my isle of emptiness

Leaving it my way, seems so long since I've been here
Running the circle
Counter clockwise, chased by fear

When your shadows wears my name
When the darkness falls, the silence grows
within a heartbeat
When your shadows wears my name
On my isle of emptiness

[Solo: Henrik/Tony]

When your shadows wears my name
When the darkness falls, the silence grows
within a heartbeat
When your shadows wears my name
On my isle of emptiness
