[Solo: Henrik]

No way to analyse, how much you there's left inside
No heart to call your own Are you pulled under?

Are we pulled under?
Are you alone?
Far beyond the dreams of shattered minds

Denied a second glance, focused on your self defence
Too many demons to block out Can you surrender?

Can we surrender?
Are we so proud, too proud to see?
Love can he a turning point

Golden years - look into your past and let it shine
Golden tears - let'em reach your heart then
wake up mind

Now from a stepping stone, be the person you've been
shown
So the inner you prevail

When there's tomorrow
Then live today
Drinking from the finest wine

[Solo: Tony]

Are you pulled under?
Are you alone?
Far beyond the dreams...

Golden years - look into your past and let it shine
Golden tears - let'em reach your heart then
wake up mind

No way to analyse, how much you there's left inside
No heart to call your own Can you surrender?

Can we surrender?
Are we so proud, too proud to see?
Love can he...

When there's tomorrow
Then live today
Drinking from the finest wine
