[Solo: Henrik]

My river cries a thousand tears
The more it cries, the more I fear
Am I to relief again, am I to die

A world worth dying in
Is a world worth dying for
But should the world by dying
Due to the human hands of sin
Shouldn't we be strong?
Shouldn't we jump in?
Leave the game to drown in Lake Silver

My mountain chokes on troubled skies
The more it gasps, the more I sigh
Am I to relief again, am I to die

A world worth dying in
Is a world worth dying for
But should the world by dying
Due to the human hands of sin
Shouldn't we be strong?
Shouldn't we jump in?
Leave the game to drown in Lake Silver

[Solo: Tony]

The sea of life is way to black
The life it gave, it wants it back
Am I to relief again, am I to die

A world worth dying in
Is a world worth dying for
But should the world by dying
Due to the human hands of sin
Shouldn't we be strong?
Shouldn't we jump in?
Leave the game to drown in Lake Silver
