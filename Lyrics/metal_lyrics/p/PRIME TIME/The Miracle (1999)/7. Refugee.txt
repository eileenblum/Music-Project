Take a good look inside of me...
Season of night took hold of me...
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide away
The damage is done, the chaos' dissolving me

What am I to do
Where am I to go
How can I be strong and find the strength to carry on

Misery comes, but doesn't go, don't want to reach
tomorrow
Don't want to be a refugee of love

Found a new way to the future...
Created a past to remember...
No ties attached, no one to hold you down
Am I the stone that made you dislike the crown

How am I to say, what I have to lose
When your mind's made up and it's your
happiness you chose

Misery comes, but doesn't go, don't want to reach
tomorrow
Don't want to be a refugee of love

[Solo: Henrik]

Take a good look inside of me...
Hatred and pain controlling me...
Holding the cards fearless in front of me
The sun on your face, the coldness it's freezing me

What am I to do
Where am I to go
How can I be strong and find the strength to carry on

Misery comes, but doesn't go, don't want to reach
tomorrow
Don't want to be a refugee of love
