"Such an awkward afternoon", you say:
"All necessities, they fade"
After all we're on the move again
And we're come to taste the light

All we do and all we say, touched by light
All I need to know today
All my doubt and all my pain, touched by you
Fly like feathers on the wind

"Open up your eyes", I say
"I am hopelessly confused"
After all it a bound to be this way
And I've come to taste the light

All we do and all we say, touched by light
All I need to know today
All my doubt and all my pain, touched by you
Fly like feathers on the wind

[Solo: Tony/Henrik]

After all we're on the move again
And we're come to taste the light

All we do and all we say, touched by light
All I need to know today
All my doubt and all my pain, touched by you
Fly like feathers on the wind
