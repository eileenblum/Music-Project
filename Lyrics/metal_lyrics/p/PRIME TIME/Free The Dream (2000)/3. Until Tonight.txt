The wind in my hair, a song in my heart
The road in the mirror is falling apart

[Chorus]

And itâs all I ever wanted
And that was all Iâd ever need
Until tonight

Living a lie, so cold and silent
Ending the war inside
I know I have make you stay

Your gentle forceâ¦ I must surrender
Here I am
This is love, I am yours
Other faces, other nightsâ¦ I canât remember
Here I am
This is me, I am yours

Building a wall inside
I know I have to make you stay

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Living a lie, so cold and silent
Ending the war inside
I know I have make you stay

[Chorus]

Living a life so free and careless
Building a wall inside
I know I have to make you stay

Your gentle forceâ¦ I must surrender
Here I am
This is love, I am yours
Other faces, other nightsâ¦ I canât remember
Here I am
This is me, I am yours
