Another morning cracks
Another test of hours lies ahead
The day has come to haunt meâ¦ again

And yet a sleepless night has passed
And pushed the memories on ahead
But I have ways of finding

I just close my eyesâ¦ I donât want to realise

You still belong
Right here in my arms

[Chorus]

You still belong â oh yeah yeah
You still belong
To me, right or wrong
You still belong

How can you live, my loveâ¦
Knowing that my heart has been betrayed
For you were there to scar meâ¦

I just close my eyesâ¦ I donât want to realize

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Another morning cracks
Another night just passed
Another day and youâre not here with me

I just close my eyesâ¦ you donât seem to realize

You still belong
Right here in my arms

You still belong â oh yeah yeah
You still belong
To me, right or wrong
You still belong
