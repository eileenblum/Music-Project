Inside your darkened room
Paralysed, traumatized
A ray of light appears, fire in the hole
Brakes your defences, heals up the senses

Itâs gonna be the air you breathe
Itâs gonna take forever and a dayâ¦ at least

Let it move you- listen to the voice inside

[Chorus]

Be the one that you decide
Let it move you- hold on tight and donât let go
This is the new you

Inside your blackened heart, agonized, hypnotized
A ray of light appears, fire in the hole
Breaks down the fences, heats up the soul

Itâs gonna be the air you breathe
Itâs gonna take forever and a dayâ¦ at least

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Iâll be by your side, right here by your side
Donât make me waitâ¦

Let it move you- listen to the voice inside

[Chorus]

Be the one that you decide
Let it move you- hold on tight and donât let go
This is the new you
