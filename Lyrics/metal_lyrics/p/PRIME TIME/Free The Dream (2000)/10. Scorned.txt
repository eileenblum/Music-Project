You could be so wrong
You could be my only friend
You could be my rise, you could be my fall
You could be my everything or anything at all

Itâs getting stronger everyday

[Chorus]

Here, in my wasteland, scorned and tainted
(Calling you in my shameless way)
World of shameless ways
In my independent, words transcended
World to stay
(Calling you all night long to stay)

You could be my bride
You could be my deepest fear
You could be my loss, you could be me win
You could heal my darkest side
Before the night kicks in

Itâs getting darker everyday

[Chorus]

[Solo]

You could be my friend, wonât you be my friend
You could make me rise
You could mean my end
You could spend the night
You can spend my days
You could free me of my hurting ways

Here, in my wasteland, scorned and tainted
(Calling you in my shameless way)
World of shameless ways
In my independent, words transcended
World to stay
(Calling you all night long to stay)
