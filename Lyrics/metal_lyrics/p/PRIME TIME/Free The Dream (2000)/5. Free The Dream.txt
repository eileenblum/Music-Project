I buried the truth, so scared I tried
To wash off the filth
The part of me that dies
Tomorrow comes another way, a better day to
fill the void inside

So what is your truth and what is mine
The presence of things could be a state of mind
Tomorrow is a long, long wayâ¦ it takes a day
I could be purified

So free your mind and fly away
Like a phoenix rising

Freedom, dream unbroken
Spirit world coming down tonight

[Chorus]

Free the dream and hope that
We can be one on the other side
Let us be one with the ones that tried

I buried the truth, so scared I tried
To wash off the filth
The part of me that dies
Tomorrow comes another way, a better day to
fill the void inside

So free your mind and fly away
Like a phoenix rising

[Chorus]

[Solo]

We buried the truth, so sacred we tried
To wash off the filth
Another angel dies
Tomorrow is a long, long wayâ¦ it takes a day
We could be purified

Freedom, dream unbroken
Spirit world coming down tonight

[Chorus]

Free the dream and hope that
We can be one on the other side
Let us be one with the ones that tried

[Solo]
