Used to think that I was special
So on top of life, you see
Miles ahead of what was meant to be

Chasing lyrics from a song
I tired killing all the love inside
Heading for a life of ecstasy

I always thought that I could make it
Far away from home

Heard your verdict on the street
Touched my soul and raised my heartbeat

[Chorus]

Iâm coming home
Showed your beauty from within
Tossed a line and pulled me back in
Iâm coming home

After rocking every boat I felt
Satisfaction kept withheld
No one in the world feel like me

Every couple in the street
It seemed they had stolen all me dreams
Living up their lives the way I should

I always thought that I could make it
Far away from home

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Heard your verdict on the street
Touched my soul and raised my heartbeat

[Chorus]

Iâm coming home
Showed your beauty from within
Toseed a line and pulled me back in
Iâm coming home
