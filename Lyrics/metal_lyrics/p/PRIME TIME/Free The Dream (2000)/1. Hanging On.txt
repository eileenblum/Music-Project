You need to be aloneâ¦ just for a little while
Your face to me is an open book
When you fake the look
Like a little child
You turn to crack a smile and pull me in

I need to be confined, more than anything
A hungry look to the other side
But the time is wrong when the place is right
I know you draw the line
Hoping Iâll be back in time

Iâll be on my way, to be by your side
Iâll be by your side, I am on my way

[Chorus]

Iâll be on my way, to be by your side
Iâll be by your side, baby, everyday
Countless nights and countless days

I need some solid ground, before I sink away
I need a rest from this nasty ride
Spin me round and round
With this game you play
I barely hold the lineâ¦ hope you pull me in time

[Chorus]

You want the things I canât let goâ¦
One thing I think you ought to know
Youâre like a monkey on my backâ¦
It keeps me hanging on

[Solo]

Iâll be on my way, to be by your side
Iâll be by your side, I am on my way

[Chorus]

Iâll be on my way, to be by your side
Iâll be by your side, baby, everyday
Countless nights and countless days
