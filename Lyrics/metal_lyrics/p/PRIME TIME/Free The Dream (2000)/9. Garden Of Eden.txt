Iâm in this crazy situation
I need an angel in my life to set me free
From head to toe build for temptation
She is the one thing in my life
That makes me go on
Right until the end, girl

Sheâs way too dangerous
I donât mind as long as sheâs here

[Chorus]

Green eyed predicament
I donât mind to be a number
All I need is her in my Garden of Eden

Iâm too deep, thereâs no salvation
âCause if she granted me a wish
Iâd make her stay
Right at the core of the sensation
She is the centre of the universe to me
Right until the end, girl

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Green eyed teaser, right until the end girl

Sheâs way too dangerous
I donât mind as long as sheâs here

[Chorus]

Green eyed predicament
I donât mind to be a number
All I need is her in my Garden of Eden
