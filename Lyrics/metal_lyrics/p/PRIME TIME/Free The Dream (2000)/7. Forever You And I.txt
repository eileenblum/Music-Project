Iâm in a state of love shock
Stuck in this win/lose situation
Youâre on a ride and I want to get on
Trapped in this show-mo animation

One lookâ¦ Iâm hooked
One touchâ¦ Iâm booked
I need to feel like I want you to feel
Got to hold onâ¦ got to hold on

Your angel eyes and demon smile
This stunning sigh donât need explanation
You carry goods which I want to hold
Got to hold onâ¦ need to hold on

(what do I have to say?)

We could make it if we tried
We could step into the light

[Chorus]

Baby, we could be together
We could reach the sky above
We could be so much in love
Baby we could be forever, you and I

Iâm in this state of love stock
Stuck in this win/lose situation
Your angel smile like you wrote the book
Best of the female population

(What do I have to say?)

[Chorus]

[Solo]

We could have a future in a way
We could have a season in a day
Thatâs why I need you

We could make it if we tried
We could step into the light

[Chorus]

Baby, we could be together
We could reach the sky above
We could be so much in love
Baby we could be forever, you and I
