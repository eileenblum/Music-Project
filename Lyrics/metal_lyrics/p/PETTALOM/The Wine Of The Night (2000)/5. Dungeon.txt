"Amen, Cristian priest!" 

Listen these shadows words 
Lost in the darkest way 
Where the strides are only distant 
Dreams and memories of realities 
That lies without name 
In the Portals 
On this silent madness 

Behind the ancient door of dark 
The beating of my heart is crying 
Each second like a dumb bell 
Your tears are distorted scenes of dream 

Into the dungeon, oh, someone 
Can you hear me away? 
Awake the insane 
Set me free 'cause I burn in this hell 

"Witch, kneel! In the name of the church I kill!" 

The sun out there is waiting for me 
I will take in my hands the light of 
Your heat running wild in the mind 
Out darkness to a place where there no chains...
