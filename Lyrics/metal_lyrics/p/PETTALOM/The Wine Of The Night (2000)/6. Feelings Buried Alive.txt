Lost dreams left to the way 
Snow served to the loneliness 
In sun cup shine the tears 
The dawn in the trays of smiles 

Scarlet midnight wrapped wine 
Haunted by love and ice 
Sheding the cold in dying promises 
Soul of snow from the ancient abbeys 

Entrails receive me 
White flesh, oh altar 
Sleeping in your temple 
Where the pain is so far... 
Little fairy kiss my tears 
Wine pray to the night 
Burial of my feelings 
In the silent exile 

Challenging your shadows where the death call in ecstasy 
And rest where the promises sing in fall your face in the wind 
Your face extends over where the nymphs and magicians sleeps 
Loving the deep enchantments and your pain inside me 
In desires, of set thorn in time, and time and rain, Oh pain! 
Give me back feelings, they are buried alive into your veins 

The song of the winds 
In the forest smell 
Silence burning in the fairy spell 

Bewitched, deep 
Rise up my wings 
On the desert of my dead dreams 

"Quadros nas sombras 
HÃ¡ uma luz ancestral 
Onde a memÃ³ria sonha o abraÃ§o dos tempos 
O presente, seu nome 
Talvez silÃªncio 
Onde as horas erguem as suas asas 
Aprisionadas ao fio das palavras"
