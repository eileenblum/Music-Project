"Oh goddess of golden hair 
your smile to me is the dawn 
Woman from the ancient lands 
Bless the earth, in the voices of the north winds! 
I drink the wine from her lips 
I drink the blood of the stars in the cup of the skull!" 

We are the songs 
Gods of the sea 
Pray for me 
Sailing in my sins 

Oh, pale queen 
Bless the wine 
Siren from doom 
Blood divine 

Solvet saeculum in favilla 
Per sepulcra regionum 
Quidquid latet apparebit 
Et lux perpetua luceateis 

Liber scriptus proferetus 
Unde mundus judicetur 
Ad et omnis caro veniet 
Exaudi orationem meam 

[Latin]

Ride with me 
On night winds 
Dreaming in lust 
Old rites kiss 

North winds 
Bless the sky 
Sister of my soul 
We are sons of the light 

[Repeat Latin]

"The glory of the ancient gods 
Forgotten by the dark ages 
But our pagan souls are stars that ever return 
Blessed by the mother Earth, dancing over skull!..."
