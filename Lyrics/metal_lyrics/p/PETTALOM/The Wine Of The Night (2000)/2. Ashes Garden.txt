The unknown is only for some 
And only the shadows know 
Know your face and keep it warm 
One of the candles of the soul 

The sky is dark 
Lighted in glory on the ashes wind 
Shading the castles garden... 
soul of my soul 

Who deserve my tears? 
In the cry of the time 
Of my confused mind 

The eternal night 
Slowly blind my eyes 
With the flames of the truths 

So quiet... is the deaf wind 
So silent... silent is the kingdom of the night 
Oh, the time... Burning so cold 
Eternal eyes so... empty! 

Portraits in front my eyes are like a flame 
Ashen pictures... kissing the sky on the moon 
Of the shame 

Listen my heart now 
In the ashes garden I hear your call 
For the lust and spell 
The treason laces... the thorns are cells
