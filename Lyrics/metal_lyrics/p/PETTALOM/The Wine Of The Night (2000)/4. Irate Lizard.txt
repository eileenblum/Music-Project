The irate lizard 
Creep by the dunes 
Of a idea's desert, the lizard take on 
Among the cold and the misery 
By the skin and realities 
Of your heroes, killers and strangers 
Feeling the taste of mazes 
And the colors and the leaved pains 
Over the infinite trails 
Of the lost and the conquered dreams 

Walking by the sun light 
When finish in the evening end 
Your rays in my face 
Big memories, of times that no more return 

Oh, sensations, my forgotten rage 
Is the place where the sun ends 
Over my old secrets words 
My body cry at the touch of old dreams 

The lizard take on by sweat 
By the fever of the burning heat 
Where the dreams doors of realities 
Of the life and death are confunded 

Eyes of the lizard 
Tears of the moon 
Songs of the insane 
Storms before the sun 

The irate lizard 
Devour my mazes then rest in peace 
Of the times that cross 
That cross streets and lanes 

Like a crowd without control 
Your memories photograph the floor 
In each dream that breathe 
Drinking the perspiration of thoughts that move 
And end 

Moving to the end.
