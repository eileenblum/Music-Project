Nights and nights I lose my reason 
Oh, my bride... who am I in these 
Nightmares of a dream land burning? 
Oh, her teeth... her teeth are 
Brightness of insane reasons 
Haunted... Flying by the 
Gold of walls in black wings 
Silent wings 
I scream your name 

Oh, cypress night, sweet child 
Dying ivory smile 
You shade the winter... oh-oh 
Oh, Silfide on that fountains 

Oh, NÃ¡iade! 
In the bushes of Arnheim 
Steps cross the mist 

Keep away this mourning from me 
Where the sun is dead and cold 
In cold night her heart still is beating 
On this grave

You can't fell my pain 
Dying alone 
Race of visionary! The blood of them run 
Throught our veins 
Blood of dreams of disquiet minds! 
We... grown so much different 
Disease destroy her smile 
But her teeth shine like ideas! 

Now the silent in black wings 
Reveal the horror, oh sad queen 
The grave's doors are violated 
A lapse of reason, blood on me 

Higher night, the moon so mad 
In despair sweating so sad 
Her teeth was ideas 
Are on the floor with my sanity 

With my sanity... Oh, Berenice... forgive me!!!
