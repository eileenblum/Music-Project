Celibate, denying the keys of fire 
Cause' the heavens are fall in the hell of flames 
Among the ash and water, the sacred love of the soul 
Redemption of the flesh cell, imprisioned in the space and time 
In the space and time 

You dream, you, lonely 
Like a song of fire 
Dreaming holy ghost in this pain so higher 
Sacred crying in nightmares in lonely bridges 
Oh, Saturn's sing in the abysses of their mind 

Don't die in fire 
Don't lie in your wait 
No more god bless you 
Oh, kiss to late 

Oh, burn the snake 
That feed you with fire 
Send your dance to the sky 
Making love with forces 
Of the day and the night 

Insane and scares loneliness 
Leave your heart to the tears of gods 
Resurrection in the monk cell 
Consuming the godness and the evil 
And the reason, the sentinel 
Of the sun to be worth shiped 
Purificate the dreams of the claws of beasts 
Of the ego' legions 
Oh, please I burn in violet 
?? I burn in violet flames 

Celibate, the bitches pray in the light of your tears 
Every hearts are chained 
By the death and flesh pain 

Celibate, don't shed the sacred seed 
Of the heavens and hells are free 
Don't perpetuate this valley of tears 

Celibate, oh... celibate 
Don't shed the sacred seed 
Heavens and hells are free 
Celibate, oh... celibate 
Don't perpetuate this valley of tears 
Celibate, oh... celibate
