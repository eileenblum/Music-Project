[WORDS &amp; MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Here we stand, the chosen ones together
Will the Quest go on forever; will we reach the Promised Land
We will find the gold beneath the rainbo
Oh can you still hear the echo in the caverns of your mind ?

Hear the call, leading us to freedo
Will you join us in the kingdom and forever fight or fal
Can it be, that fate is in our favou
We will be each other's saviour as we're tearing down the walls

So many battlefields, we've seen so many di
Carry me by starlight flying high above the sky

Neverworld, beyond the blue horizo
Neverworld, is where we long to b
Across the mountains and before the setting su
Neverworld,

Shadows fall, united true believer
Where the prophecy did lead us, we have reached the hallowed lan
Heart of steel, it will not rest foreve
We are all in this together as we wait the true command.
