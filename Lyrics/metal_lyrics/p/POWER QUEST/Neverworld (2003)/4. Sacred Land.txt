[WORDS &amp; MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Memories of childhood, a place so far away
Growing up together, it was where I thought we'd stay
Then one day soldiers came, told us of the wars
They told us we should join them and defend the holy cause

Adventures that would lead far across the land and sea
Sounded so amazing to an innocent like me
Made it seem so easy like nothing could go wrong
We thought we'd be away some time but never for so long

Joined together wrote our names upon the page
Seven times alliance our loyalty we gave
Sworn to be united not divided for the King
Who will ever know the honour that it brings ?

So farewell to the Sacred Land that we call forever home
Time will tell if we understand that we never walk alone
Side by side to the east we ride with our purpose clear and true
On we go, won't you join us too ?

Had no way of knowing if we ever would return
Would we see our loved ones or see more cities burn ?
Holy land will fall if we don't stand our ground
Jerusalem for evermore in darkness be adorned.
