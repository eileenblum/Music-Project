[WORDS - WILLIAMS, NOLAN / MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Time after time still not over
There is no ending in sight
Day after day the same old feelings
Surely all this isn't right

There will be sadness in these eyes forever
Lift my head towards the sky
And I know that this will happen more and more
As I watch the spirits drifting through the door of life

I can see angels in the sky
I can see demons down below
I can see everything that you will ever know
If I should live for evermore
And never see another dawn
You will see everything that I have seen before

Living my life am I really alive ?
No one should stay here long
How can it be will you tell me why ?
Talking the right from the wrong

I only hope the day will come
The day when I can close my eyes forever
A life oblivious to time
It feels like waiting for the end of never

Falling from grace the crosses I bear now
Carry them on to the end
Nowhere to turn not a soul even cares now
Only the memory of friends

You will see everything that I ... have seen ... before.
