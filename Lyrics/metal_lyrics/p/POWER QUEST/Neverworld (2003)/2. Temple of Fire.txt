[WORDS - WILLIAMS, WALKER / MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Seeing is believing so believe in what you see
feel the flame of desire burning deep in the fire
Can this be illusion or deluded fantasy ?
Can you see what is true, for me and for you ?

The people gathered all around us
Their voices raised aloud in honour
The spell forever will be broken
See a vision of the past

Day of Old - so the story goes
Travel far - everybody knows
Pilgrim come see your hearts desire
Before the Temple of Fire

I am not hero just an ordinary man
With the will to survive to be free and alive
Come and stand beside us, see the wonder of it all
In the light of the sun, in the shade of the moon

Can you find the answers in the visions that you see ?
Can you still remember what went wrong ?
Stand before the altar in the temple you have dreamt of for so long.
