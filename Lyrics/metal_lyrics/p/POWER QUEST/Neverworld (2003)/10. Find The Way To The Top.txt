[WORDS &amp; MUSIC - Martongelli, Garavello]

I am walking in the street
And I'm shouting at this world of confusion
There is no way for me to turn back

Silence in the air seems to be an illusion
I only want to satisfy my soul

They tell me I am wrong but I don't mind their lies
And only with my pride I'll never die

Now I look for more
I look for more
And I wanna have some more so I will fly

I'm gonna find the way to the top
And fly to reach for the Land of the Sun
Where the fire burns and never, never stops
I'm gonna find the way to the top
You know I'll try 'cause I can't get enough
Want live, won't die, want run away, won't stop

I'm gonna find the way to the top
And fly to reach for the Land of the Sun
Where the fire burns and never, never stops
I'm gonna find the way to the top
You know I'll try 'cause I can't get enough
Want live, won't die, want run away, won't stop.
