[WORDS - WILLIAMS / MUSIC - SCOTT]

There was a time and place we would always go
We will meet there once again
Darkness had descended all around our home
Now we begin the journey there

Walk in the path of our fathers before
Wisdom and guidance will carry us through
Walk with the prophet who always did say
Spirits will lead us the rest of the way

Out of the darkness and into the light
Heaven beside us on this sacred night
Out of nightmare and into the dream
Returning together
The light always shines over me

Living isn't easy when you're far away from home
Seven years since we were there before
Many things have happened since we set eyes on you
Citadel in fallout from the war

City home is free again just like it was before
What will happen when we are gone ?
We hear the echoes of the time when we were young ?
Will we see darkness once again ?
