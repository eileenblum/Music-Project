[WORDS &amp; MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I search the ruins of the world I call my own
In hopeless desperation now I make the journey home
I find that everything is not the way it was
You cannot fight the future; no you can't turn back the clock

The rain upon the mountains
The eagle in the sky
And the wolf and raven prowling all around
A broken cross will mark the holy ground

And when I'm gone, the world carries on
And you must carry on too
When I'm not around, time won't stand still
Your memories will always be true

You've got hold onto the dreams we once shared
Always be together even when I am not there
I'll be beside you every step of every day
Though you cannot see me, feel my presence on the way
