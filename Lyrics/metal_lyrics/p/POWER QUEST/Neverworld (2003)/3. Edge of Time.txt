[WORDS &amp; MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I told you once, told you a thousand times
It's not easy living this way
We chose a path, said it's the only one
The only path that will lead us away

(Find a way) you're not the only one
(Living a life) on a wing and prayer
(Turn around) face another day
You and I have nothing to lose

Stone cold, waiting for night to fall
Waiting for answers we need
Where will it end ? Heavenly requiem,
Can it be that only true hearts will bleed ?

Send a sign, we're standing on the edge of time
Heart divine, a future that once was mine
I can hardly recognize what's right before my eyes
Time dissolves into well below
Time dissolves into the well below

Light has gone, burning oblivion
Unholy silence invading my mind
What does this mean ? Where do we go from here ?
You and I will have to follow the blind.
