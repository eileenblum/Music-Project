[WORDS - WILLIAMS / MUSIC - WILLIAMS, SCOTT]

Million voices call to me,
there's nowhere left to run
Souls cry out in torment,
pain and anguish has begun
Trapped for all eternity
no hope of breaking free
Calling out for vengeance,
now they're calling out to me

Will this be our true salvation ?
Can there be a brighter day ?
Will there be a new horizon ?
Will this be the price we pay ?

Chaos and damnation
For the victims of the well
Mortal life of agony,
immortal life of hell
A spell that can't be broken,
see the writing on the wall
Souls in black are silent;
wait to hear the judgement call

Deep inside the well of souls
where time is lost forever
Can you hear me call your name ?
Deep inside the well of souls a
thousand hearts are gathered
There must be someone to blame
