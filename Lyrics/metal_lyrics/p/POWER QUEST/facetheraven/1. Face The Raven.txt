When you're searching for an alibi
Who can you trust, on who can you rely?
You're searching for salvation

When you're looking for an easy out
Hesitation or a fleeting doubt
More in hope than expectation

You can run from the reaper man
But you'll never get away
You can hide in the shadowlands
But he'll find you all the same

In our lives
We face the raven
Then it's time to die
And he's coming for us all
Can't deny
Time's gone by
Reflected in his eye
There is no escape for you... tonight

Don't go looking for another way
Doors are locked and there's a price to pay
Your mind's in deep confusion

Don't you think about the coward's way
Face the pain, get on your knees and pray
Here's Mister Retribution

You can run from the reaper man
But you'll never get away
You can hide in the shadowlands
But he'll find you all the same

In our lives
We face the raven
Then it's time to die
And he's coming for us all
Can't deny
Time's gone by
Reflected in his eye
There is no escape for you

In our lives
We face the raven
Then it's time to die
And he's coming for us all
Can't deny
Time's gone by
Reflected in his eye
There is no escape for you... tonight
Tonight!
