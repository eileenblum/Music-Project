Another time and space
A place where magic can die
Killing the dreamers, hate in their eyes
I only hope I live til tomorrow

A thousand days and nights
And all that time on my own
Knowing that I must journey home
Back to the sacred land of my fathers

I know I cannot be the saviour of the world
But I'll do everything that I can to be free

[Chorus:]
Coming home to Neverworld
Over the mountains and so far away
Time has come to stand as one
Follow your Heart and you'll find better days

The road is long we carry on
Forever hope in our hearts
Sworn in communion, can't tear us apart
We are the chosen ones the alliance

We have returned, darkness failed
Heading into the light
Finding my heaven, Glory tonight
Back to the sacred land of our fathers

I know I cannot be the saviour of the world
But I'll do everything that I can to be free

[Chorus:]
Coming home to Neverworld
Over the mountains and so far away
Time has come to stand as one
Follow your Heart and you'll find better days

[Interlude]

I know I cannot be the saviour of the world
But I'll do everything that I can to be free

[Chorus:]
Coming home to Neverworld
Over the mountains and so far away
Time has come to stand as one
Follow your Heart and you'll find better days

Coming home to Neverworld
Over the mountains and so far away
Time has come to stand as one
Follow your Heart and you'll find better days
I'm Coming Home!ï»¿
