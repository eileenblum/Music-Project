Gonna be the longest night all the angels take to flight
(No-one left to save you, darkness will enslave you)
There are many twists and turns, many lessons to be learned
(Do you yearn for daylight, can you feel the madness?)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

I can feel them closing in and the nightmares now begin
(But you have to fight them, only don't believe them)
Tell you black is really white and that day is really night
(They will try to turn you, fingers poised to burn you!)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
