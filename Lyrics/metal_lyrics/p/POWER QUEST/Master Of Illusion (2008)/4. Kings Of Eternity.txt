A crash of thunder, lightning starts to glow
Standing in the rainstorm you feel so alone
And in the distance can you hear the sound of something new
The sun is hidden now, no rainbows can arise
All across the land the people look up to the skies
Can you see what's coming, do you understand what's gonna be?

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

We stand among you, this dark and fateful night
Dispel the darkness in a blazing flash of light
We have all the answers; do you doubt that we can save you now?

We walk among you, we walk on higher ground
All of us together let us gather all around
Look into the future; see the way that things are gonna be

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, we are the Kings.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.
