I always had a dream, pictures in the magazines
Want to be like all my hero's are
Will I die before I'm old; live the life of rock n' roll
Travel all the highways of the world.

I took the easy way
Turned my back and walked away
Didn't have the courage or the will
Sometimes it's hard to say
Question what I did that day
Now I know I'll hide away no more.

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

And now I'm standing here, metal anthems fill the air
Playing through the songs you all wanted to hear
Without you we will fall, you're the ones who heed the call
You're the ones who make the dream come true.

I took the easy way
Turned my back and walked away
Didn't have the courage or the will
Sometimes it's hard to say
Question what I did that day
Now I know I'll hide away no more.

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

Sometimes it seems another chance won't come my way
Won't stop believing that it might just be my day

[Solo]

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.
