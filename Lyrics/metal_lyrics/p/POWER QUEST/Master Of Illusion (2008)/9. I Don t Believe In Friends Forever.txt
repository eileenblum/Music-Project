You never know who you can trust
You never know who's gonna stab you in the back
Sometimes you just don't know your friends
Sometimes you gotta sleep with one eye open.

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

Some people only think of them
Their deeds remind me what I never want to be
They have no reason to exist
All they do in life is count their money

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.
