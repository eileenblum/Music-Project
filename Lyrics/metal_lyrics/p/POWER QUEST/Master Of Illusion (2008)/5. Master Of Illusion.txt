You paint a picture of what you want us to see
Masking the wreckage of our own reality
Ignoring genocide in corners of the world
You're only interested if there's some oil or gold.

Why don't you just reach out your hand
To people of your land?
You turn a blind eye to their plight
How can this be right?

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

Ignore the warning signs that come from mother earth
Evolving climate change, there cannot be rebirth
I read it in the news, I see it on TV
Forgotten faces could so easily be me.

You want to send them all to hell
You're going there as well (There as well)
What makes you act the way you do
I see right through you.

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

[Solo Monstruoso]

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?
