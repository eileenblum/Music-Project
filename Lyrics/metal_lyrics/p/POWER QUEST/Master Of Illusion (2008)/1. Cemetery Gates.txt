I never walked a lonely road
When I was young
You were always there to guide me
And if I stand up should fall
Along the way
You would pick up all the pieces.

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

And now I turn and face the truth
I'm older now
With your spirit watching over me
I hope you're in a better place
I have no doubt
Sacred hearts, sacred memories.

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?
