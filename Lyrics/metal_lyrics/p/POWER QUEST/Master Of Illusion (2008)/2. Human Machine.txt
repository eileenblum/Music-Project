I'm trapped inside this life
The same thing every day
Too afraid to change
Is there another way?
I have no confidence
To try and break the chains
We only get one life
And only half remains.

Time slips away
Software corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

Another chance to change
Another exit gone
I didn't have the faith
How could I be so wrong?
Forever unaware
How quickly time goes by
Maybe it's not too late
I still control my fate

Time slips away
Hardware corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

Time slips away
Mankind corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

(Every day, carry out the same routine
9 to 5, cogs in the human machine
40 years, doing what they tell you to
Now you're old, is this what you waited for?)

(Can't you see, not the way it has to be
Make a choice, beauty of humanity
No regrets, I did what I wanted to
Time to die: you did what they told you to.)
