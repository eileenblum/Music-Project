In a time of restlessness.
We live in hate and fear
Fighting for religion.
As we face another year
Murder breeding murder, a new morality
Killing in the name of some immortal mystery.

For all eternity, we will stand as one
Coming from the corners of the world

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

Can you see the justice, the reason for this crime?
Ain't no fight for freedom.
Can we really be so blind?
Brother stands with brother, don't need to be afraid
We are all the children and we must not fade away

For all eternity, we will stand as one
Coming from the corners of the world

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

And we will find a way to stay together now
And send a message cross the stars.

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)
