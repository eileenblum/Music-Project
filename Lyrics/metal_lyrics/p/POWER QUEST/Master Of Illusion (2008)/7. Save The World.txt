This world ain't what it used to be
I'm fighting things I cannot see
I think there's something going on tonight
The future melted with the past
I don't know how long this can last
There's something out there but it don't feel right

Some things I recognise but others seem so strange
Can't believe I fully understand
How things can be one way and
Then suddenly they're turned upon their head.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

Our leaders just don't seem to care
They sanction fighting everywhere
But what the hell is all this fighting for?
Then politicians take their leave
Leave the rest of us to grieve
And shed a tear for those who went to war.

Some things I recognise but others seem so strange
Can't believe I fully understand
How things can be one way and
Then suddenly they're turned upon their head.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

So can't we all just live our lives?
So many people need not die
Why can't they see we are all flesh and blood?
There has to be another way
I don't care what our leaders say
I know that we can find a brighter day.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.
