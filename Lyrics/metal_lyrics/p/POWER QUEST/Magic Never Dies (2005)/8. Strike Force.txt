When you feel in danger
Everyone's a stranger now
What more can you do?
When you feel uncertain
Behind a twitching curtain, yeah
Where else can you go?

All alone, there's no one left for you
Fear unknown, they're coming for you too.
Close to tears, the ending of the years
Who is gonna come and save you now?

Send for the Strike Force to come and deliver you now
Call on the Strike Force we'll come and put right what went wrong
It won't take us long !

If you feel like lying
Gonna end up dying soon
They will hunt you down
Don't you know the answer?
Will you take a chance right now?
There's nothing left to lose.
