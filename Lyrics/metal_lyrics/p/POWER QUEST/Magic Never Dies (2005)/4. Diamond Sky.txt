I'm searching for glory and truth
You know it's not gonna be easy
Maybe I'm dreaming, but life is so cruel
The power is leading my heart.

Draw in your mind a utopian world
I want to break free and escape here
Don't wanna hide in the shadows no more
Follow me, it's not too late.

Now try to believe me
From now on you've all got to listen to me
We never will fall
Forever we'll be free

Fly over the sun, find a way out
Higher and higher
We'll ride together as one
Back to the Diamond Sky.

Show me the way that you try to survive
What is your only desire?
See the destruction around us tonight
Spread all our faith through the fire.

Fly over the sun, find a way out
Higher and higher
We'll ride together as one
Back to the Diamond Sky.
Fly over the sun, follow the light
Holding your life
We'll ride together as one
Straight to the Diamond Sky

We'll climb all the hills and the mountains
Right now through the clouds we will find
The saviour that keeps all our lives
Leading us to the sky.

We are the ones that will save human kind
Fight for a place we can stay in
Send me a sign if you still wanna try
Look for the truth once again
