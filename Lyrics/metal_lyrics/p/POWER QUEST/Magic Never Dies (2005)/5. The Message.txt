I saw you turn and walk away
I never thought that day would be the last day
We would ever meet.
Looking back on all we had
We had each other and that was enough for us
Didn't need any more.

Now it's time to leave again
Time to travel many miles
I will think of you tonight.

And I wake up all alone
A message on my phone
Saying you've left me - for another guy
And you say I'm never home
I'm always on the road
But I still love you more that you'll ever know.

I guess we never really knew
How things would change for the and for you
Couldn't see it at all
Said you wanted me to stay
I heard your words but there was no way
I could give up my dream.
