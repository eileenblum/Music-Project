The light around me turns to grey
I'm falling
Memories of yesterday
Recalling

Something's changed but I don't know why
And I don't know where I should turn
Re-arranged all the sands of time
Blood in my veins stars to burn.

Soulfire, burning forever
Soulfire, a flame in the night
Guiding the way like a lamp in the darkness
Soulfire always burns in sacred light.

See the remnants of forgotten dreams
Evolving
Places I was sure that I had been
Dissolving
