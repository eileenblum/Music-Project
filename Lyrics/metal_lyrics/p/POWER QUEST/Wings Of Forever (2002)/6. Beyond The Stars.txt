[Music - Totman / Words - Williams, Totman]

Walking through shadows down the night of memory lane
Think of the past I'm reminded once again
A place where the people had gathered as one
Their spirit provided a haven for all

Darkness may cover the land far away
Visions uncover the past once again
My soul feels the echo of yesterdays dream
And our purpose discovered at last.

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
And for ever the quest must go on

The ancient village is destroyed, the people all are gone
Bodies are buried and marked with a stone
The voice of our father still rides on the wind
Brings hope for the ones that are still yet to come

Darkness may cover the land far away
Visions uncover the past once again
My soul feels the echo of yesterdays dream
And our purpose discovered at last.

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
and for ever the quest must go on.

[Solo (Williams) / Solo (Totman) / Solo (Bickers)]

Black Knights together demons they send
We fight the evil on to the end
On the march for ever after, standing by the King forever
Bound to live for now and evermore

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven with glory we die

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
And for ever the quest must go on.
And for ever the quest must go on.
