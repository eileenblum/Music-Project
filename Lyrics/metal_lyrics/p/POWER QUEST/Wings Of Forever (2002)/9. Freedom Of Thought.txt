[Words and Music - Adam Bickers]

[Verse 1.]
I look around and what do I see ?
Imprisoned minds in a sick society
I watch as the cycle goes on
Does no one else see that this is wrong ?
Spoon fed ignorant lies whilst imagination dies
Ready to accept (whatever offered next) without question or insight.

[Verse 2.]
I see, but I can't believe
My eyes grow black at this obscenity
Young lives compressed in the mould
Factory pre-set, dead before they're old.
Regurgitating filth, so typical of their ilk
Xenophobic breed, incredulous creed, deprived of all free will.

So fight - Defend your integrity
Be strong - Don't accept mediocrity
Preserve - The individual within
Believe - You never have to give in.

Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

[Verse 3.]
It's time to make a stand
The future sits rooted in our hands
Break out of this cycle you are in
Uncharted paths is were true life begins.
No need to be alone, to make it on your own
We'll all be there to face the glare of uncertainty (and the) unknown.

So fight - Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find
