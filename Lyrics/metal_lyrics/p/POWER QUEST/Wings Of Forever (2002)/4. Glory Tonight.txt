[Words and Music - Williams]

An echo on the wind tells a distant warning
Time has come for us to make the journey home
We followed all our lives tales of beasts and valour
And heroes who have walked this road before

If there was another way
If the light can pierce the dark
It seems there's nowhere left to turn
We stand up as one now that our time has come.

Twilight surrounds us the night closes in
Darkness has fallen we stand for our King
An empire in shadows the candle burns low
We'll all find some glory tonight

The chaos in our minds tells a different story
If the light can pierce the dark
Now world will see... see what we are made of
And how we'll conquer all to save the crown

Twilight surrounds us the night closes in
Darkness has fallen we stand for our King
An empire in shadows the candle burns low
We'll all find some glory tonight

[Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Williams) / Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Totman)]

If there was another way
If the light can pierce the dark
It seems there's nowhere left to turn
We stand up as one now that our time has come.

We'll all find some glory....... tonight.
