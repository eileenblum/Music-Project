[Words and Music - Williams]

[Solo (Martongelli)]

A feeling deep within
A memory of how we used to be
I see it in your eyes
And I know you feel the same way too

The seeds of doubt were sown
When confidence has been betrayed
What am I doing here ?
But do you feel the same way too ?

The signs were there but we decided not to look
A premonition of the last page of the book
When we get down to it there's no-one else to blame
Questions may change but the answer's the same

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

An opportunity
A chance to make amends for what went wrong
Another twist of fate
Conspires to leave me here alone once more

The signs were there but we decided not to look
A premonition of the last page of the book
When we get down to it there's no-one else blame
Questions may change but the answers' the same

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

[Solo (Williams) / Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Totman) / Solo (Martongelli)]

My spirit will never be broken
The quest will go on to the end
This time is forever
The promise we held deep inside

Thought rivers and mountains between us
Together as one we will be
I'll never stop searching
To find you my friend once again

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue
