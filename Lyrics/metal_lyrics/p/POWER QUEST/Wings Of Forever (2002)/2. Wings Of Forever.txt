[Words and Music - Williams]

The kingdom lies in shadows, now the sun is burning grey
will we even live to see tomorrow?
The echoes of the battlefield still ringing in our cars
Now our future dark and stained with tears of sorrow

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind.
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our to the stars far beyond

We cross the distant mountains, riding on through wind and rain
Beneath us in the valley lie the warriors so brave
A place for them is grand by the wisdom of the kings
And we'll join them when they toll the judgement bell

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our to the stars far beyond

[Solo (Totman) / Solo (Bickers)]

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our eyes to the stars far beyond
Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And our wings all raise to the stars far beyond
