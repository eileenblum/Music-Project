[Words and Music - Williams]

I dream of strange illusions and the legacy of old
But can I really trust the visions that I see ?
Take me to the temple, I desire to see the truth
And to discover what the future holds for me

The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

I stand and wait in silence for the one who will arrive
To help me understand exactly what to do
Guiding me with wisdom that I'll need to stay alive
Is what I'll need if I'm to see the journey through

The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

[P.] The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

[C.] Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day
