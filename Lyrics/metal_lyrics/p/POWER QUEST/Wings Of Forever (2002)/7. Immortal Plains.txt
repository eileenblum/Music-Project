[Words and Music - Williams]

What about everything that happened long ago
What about plans we made together
What about comrades stood beside us way back when
It seemed times would last forever

With sword in hand we will make a stand
Eternity would not see us divided
In the darkest night though there was no light
We see the way before us clear as day

If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Through the wind and the rain we'll meet again
On immortal plains.

What about all the things that still are yet to come
What about all the things we dreamed of
Can we be certain now just what lies far beyond
Can we feel safe without the answers.

With sword in hand we would make a stand
Eternity would not see us divided
In the darkest night though there was no light
We see the way before us clear as day

[Ch.] If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Though the wind and the rain we'll meet again
On immortal plains
