We are the chosen ones, marching out to distant lands
I don't know when we will return
So many miles from home, lonely road we travel on
We have a mission to fulfill

[Chorus I:]
Over rainbows and stars
You can be sure I'll be there
When you're feeling alone
These are the words that will lift up your heart

[Chorus II:]
Glorious
Sunrise in Eden, the will to go on
Glorious
Never surrender, our lives will be glorious

Forever we are free, standing here in unity
No one can ever bring us down
Beyond the fires of hell, deep inside a wishing well
You'll find the answers that you seek

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]
