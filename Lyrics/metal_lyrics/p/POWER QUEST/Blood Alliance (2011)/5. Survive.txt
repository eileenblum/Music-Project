World of confusion
Face oblivion
Veil of illusion
Everything is wrong

Leaders they fail us
Just don't have a prayer
Serving self interest
No one really cares

[Chorus I:]

After all is said and done
There's nothing left to lose
Has the story finally ended tonight?
Have you made your final move?
The sands are running low
Can you see a new horizon tonight?

[Chorus II:]

We can run, we can hide
We can say our last goodbye
Heaven knows, we're all too young to die
We can fight, we can try
Living under the same sky
Be aware, don't be scared
We'll survive

Power of deception
Growing every day
Communication
Nothing left to say

Heart of a lion
To fight their evil ways
We're only human
We must not be afraid

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

Looking back on better days
Can't believe that we have fallen so far
Who can help us find our way?
Who can take away their power and set us all free?

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]
