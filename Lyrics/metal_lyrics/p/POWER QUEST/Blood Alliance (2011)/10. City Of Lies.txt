They thought the streets were paved with gold
And riches still untold
They didn't realise the truth
I heard the stories long ago
How young men went alone
Searching for fortune and for fame

A final chance to make amends
The phoenix from the flames
Evolving tales from history
Carry our hope for all these years
And letting go your fears
To leave the mark on Neverworld

[Chorus I:]
And when the daylight fades, it's dangerous outside
Don't walk the streets alone, you just might not survive
Out there in the shadows they are waiting there for you
Waiting for the moment to arrive

[Chorus II:]
Nowhere to hide in the city of lies
No one to turn to, life's on the line
Nothing to save you from what you'll become
Caught in a web, trapped in the city of lies

I see the truth with my own eyes
There's nothing to disguise
A city now consumed by crime
There are no rainbows and no gold
Just nightmares to be sold
To desperate souls on borrowed time

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

Nothing to save you from what you'll become
Caught in a web, trapped in the city of lies
