I've seen the writing on the wall, believe me
I know they wanted us to fall away
They criticised our every move, deceivers
They never wanted us to break their chains

[Chorus I:]
They sit in judgement and they think they know it all
They act like gods but they are human after all
I don't care what they say
They just want to shoot us down in flames

[Chorus II:]
Rising anew, in from the cold
Ready to strike, never grow old
No one can ever hold us down
Rising again, back on the streets
We have the power to believe
No one on earth can stop us now

The words they write are not the truth, I've seen them
Refuse to open up their eyes and ears
For you my friends we carry on, believers
The Quest will always be what makes us strong

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus II]
