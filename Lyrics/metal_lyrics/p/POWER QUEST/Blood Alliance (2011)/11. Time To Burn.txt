[Bonus track]

We are responsible, we cannot shake the blame
We have the scientific knowledge to remain
United Nations, do they really stand as one?
Subversive politics, but surely this is wrong

[Chorus I:]
It's safe to say that it won't happen in our lifetime
But that's no reason to ignore the warning signs

[Chorus II:]
Time - there'll be no long goodbyes
There's no way to survive
This world is lost forever
Burn - there's no air left to breathe
There's no one here to grieve
Life is finally over

It's time to burn

We have the evidence, we cannot turn and leave
We are the generation haunted by disease
Some day when we are gone, our planet on its knees
Maybe they'll question why we flattered to deceive

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

It's time to burn

Across the universe, an echo far away
Another planet dies, another born today
After millennia when others take our place
I hope they learn from our mistakes

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

It's time to burn
