She's an angel, running all night through the badlands
Trying to find her way home
Hiding her eyes from the sandman
Till morning breaks through she's alone
Searching the dark like a radar
Trying so hard to believe
Avoiding the glare of the hangman
She reaches for someone to hold

[Chorus I:]
If she only knew, I'll be right there with her forever
How can I explain the feelings that I know are true?

She's in danger, hearing her voice in the silence
Trying to find a way through
Feeling the eyes of a stranger
Burning so deep in her soul
Look at her now she's surrounded
Searching so hard for the light
Memories of heartbreak, confusion
I won't let her out of my sight

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]
Hold me now and stay forever
Till the sky comes crashing down
Save me now, I can't remember
If you're only in my dreams

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]
