Locked in our hearts are secrets
Never to be told
Deep in our minds are wishes
Never to unfold
We are the small communion
Hide behind closed doors
Born of a blood alliance
Beyond the realms of law

[Chorus I:]
Promise of truth passed to us all
Father to son, heritage calls
Follow the path, follow the sign
Keepers of faith as long as we stay alive

[Chorus II:]
Forever we will be guardians of the flame
Creating history, we don't reveal our name
We're not so innocent, we call for mercy
We are the ones who will remain unheard of

We are the sworn protectors
Legacy of old
We are the isolated
Condemned to walk alone
Code of the esoteric
Buried deep in time
We hold the only cipher
Ministry of crime

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

Where are the new messiahs?
Prophets of the age
We are the true disciples
Shadow renegades
We hear the distant echo
Calling down the years
We are the lonely angels
Hidden but always near

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
