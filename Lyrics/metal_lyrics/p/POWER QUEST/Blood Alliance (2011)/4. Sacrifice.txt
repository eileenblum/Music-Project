I saw it in your eyes
You left me paralysed
Now I can't remember how I felt before
Was it all in vain?
Another losing game
I can feel the fire that rages in my heart

This ain't the time to be afraid
You're not the only one who feels this way

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice - sacrifice my life
To be with you tonight
Sacrifice - nowhere left to hide
I need you by my side
Sacrifice - all the wrongs seem right
Don't leave me here alone
Sacrifice - steal away my soul
I want you to know

[Solo / Interlude]

It's only you and me
The way it's meant to be
It was written long ago before we walked the earth
I will depend on you
For you to pull me through
Climb the highest mountain to be right by your side

[Chorus]

[Solo / Interlude]

This ain't the time to be afraid
You're not the only one who feels this way

[Chorus]
