I am the spectre at the feast
I am your nemesis released
Flying âneath your radar
I am the uninvited guest
I am the ghost that never rests
Maybe I can save ya

You got to listen to the voice inside your head
You need to take a little time
You have to pay attention, soon youâll end up dead
Your life is on the line

Revolution Fighters on the road to victory
Weâre crashing through the barricades
Revolution Fighters weâll go down in history
Why donât you join our great crusade

I am the flicker in your eye
I am the light before you die
Thoughts of resurrection
Am I the devil in disguise?
Am I the cause of all the lies?
Final destination
