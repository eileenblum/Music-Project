I see a world consumed by anger
Where people look the other way
What have we done to our beloved pleasant land, yeah
Instead of fighting, can't we just reach out a hand

We can't go on believing everything's alright
Now the sandman comes to bring perpetual night

There are no heroes anymore
Now the sun has set forever
And the ships have left the shore,
No more tales of ever after
There is no-one to remember,
Only echoes of who we are
Wrote our names across the stars

We look with hope into the future
Tomorrow brings a wind of change
I pray with all my heart we find a brighter day, yeah
For all our children who are still to walk this way
