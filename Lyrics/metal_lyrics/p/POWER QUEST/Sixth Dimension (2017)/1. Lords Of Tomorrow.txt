I know the feeling
You think all hope is gone
There is no one to turn to
Nowhere to run

You're hearing voices that I heard so long ago
Saying nothing you can do is feeling worthy

I dodged the bullets and I watched the arrows fly
I got your back because I know that you got mine
Honesty, integrity may be the only hope
All I know is the way I must go

Calling the lords of tomorrow
Hold your head high, you have nothing to lose
Don't hide the light in the shadows
You can be anything
It's up to only you, only you

I know the power that lives insisted us all
If you follow your heart and believe in your dreams
Can you be the saviour? Can you be the one?
Make a stand here tonight and forever

I dodged the bullets and I watched the arrows fly
I got your back because I know that you got mine
Honesty, integrity may be the only hope
All I know is the way I must go

Calling the lords of tomorrow
Hold your head high, you have nothing to lose
Don't hide the light in the shadows
You can be anything
It's up to only you

Calling the lords of tomorrow
Hold your head high, you have nothing to lose
Don't hide the light in the shadows
You can be anything
It's up to only you

Calling the lords of tomorrow
Hold your head high, you have nothing to lose
Don't hide the light in the shadows
You can be anything
Proud of the...
We all believe that it's true
