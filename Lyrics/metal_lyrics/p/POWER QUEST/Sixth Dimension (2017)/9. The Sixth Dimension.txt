Shadows fall at the ending of the day
Darkest time is just before the dawn
Seems to me Iâm trapped behind the veil
Maybe I am the one whoâs being torn.

Now itâs time to break away, from the chains of misery
And itâs getting hard to breathe, fading voice of liberty
See it in their eyes, turn around and say goodbye

Cross my heart and hope to die
I donât know any reason why
Iâve been left behind by a world thatâs changing
Break the night and crack the sky
Take me on to another time
Show me how to fly, to the Sixth Dimension

Hopeless land where the one eyed man is King
Shifting sands that hide how things should be
Seems to me weâre blinder every day
Maybe I am the one that truly sees.

It could never be me, I could never be free
Living here with my own reflection
If it comes from the heart, so I know I should start
Heading into the Sixth Dimension

In a world of wonder
So many paths to choose
There are roads that lead to nowhere
You must refuse
Live your life your own way
Donât let them drag you down
Hold your head up high
Your chains no longer bound
