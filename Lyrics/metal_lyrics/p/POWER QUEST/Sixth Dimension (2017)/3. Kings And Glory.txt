When the call of king and country reaches across the land
You know it's something we all understand

Riding up to defend the crown we look up to the skies
To see if there's an early warning sign

We march forever onward through the darkest night
We never will surrender, ready to fight

For the kings and the glory
Our land we will defend
Fighting 'til the very end
The power is at our command

For the guardians beside me
Loyal to a man
Side by side
Forever stand
Surrounded by glorious light

We will look for a new tomorrow for our sacred land
The battle ground is where we will be found
Never know if we will return, not even on our minds
Our mission clear, freedom for mankind

We march forever onward through the darkest night
We never will surrender, ready to fight

For the kings and the glory
Our land we will defend
Fighting 'til the very end
The power is at our command

For the guardians beside me
Loyal to a man
Side by side
Forever stand
Surrounded by glorious light

The guardians of Neverworld
Forever protecting the flame
Believe and you'll never be lonely again

We march forever onward through the darkest night
We never will surrender, ready to fight

For the kings and the glory
Our land we will defend
Fighting 'til the very end
The power is at our command

For the guardians beside me
Loyal to a man
Side by side
Forever stand
Surrounded by glorious light

Kings and the glory tonight
Kings and glory tonight
