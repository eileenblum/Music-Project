The cold is here
I can feel it all around
Even more in this trail of red
That follows me
But I'll be going on

And I'll be going strong

My kind gave me warmth
That's all they ever were to me
They cease to be as of now
I alone, I am the avatar of vital force itself

But I'll be going on
And I'll be going strong
