A nocturnal reflection of an outcast
And his shadow beneath the cracking ice
I had trusted my nature, and slipped
Into the emptiness
Drowned within myself â familiar depths....


An ancient darkness
The tomb of a forgotten void
Immersing towards this nothingness
Yet I fear it more than my own demise

The understructure of our will
A fathomless pit of no hope
I have seen how our race descends

Far across these frozen waters
A safe harbour for sanity
The shore obscured by emptiness
The trail lost in time

Far across these frozen waters
Can't let go the sight of a better future
They all crave the same
The brethren will never cross the ice

And the pressure finally rips me apart
Disheartened by the fate of our kind
Soiled water pollutes my soul
Complete dream of the future just lost
Fragments, inside me
