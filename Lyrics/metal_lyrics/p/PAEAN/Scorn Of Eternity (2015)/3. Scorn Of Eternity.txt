Unburdened, the parasite within me deprived of control
A new dimension revealed
Holding harmony within itself
Through roots implanted a vision -
Entwined in endless fractals and spirals
The infinite nature of the system
Anchoring me to the earth
Is this infinity? Timelessness?
The withering of everything
A beginning and an end
Encapsulating existence
In these confines
Set your mind
The tool to guide your arms
And break the bonds
The roots that hold you down
Fog surrounds the great hill
Through the white you walk
No sight of what's ahead
You are lost
My grave will not stand
Amidst dead trees
Long forgotten
Left in a thick haze
My ideas
will not survive
The erosion
Of time
Encased nowhere
No one will live by them
Nor will I be
For ever in their minds
Roots in the mire
Shall rot as my bones
No relic will remain
A carrion dawn for vultures
Rays cut through ivory curtains
Light burning, the lens of deceit
Through the mirror, sterile vision
The revelation, of mind and body
One
The mind that I possess
The will within my flesh
Built to be the core
Of my own reality
