Take your first breath, deep
Let in the scent of winter
Listen to the tweeting finches
And the soughing evergreen

Trust your bed of snow and dirt
Shelter under the coat of frost
Be blessed by the radiant moon
Under which you were born

Don't be blinded by the promises
That your life will ever be more
Nothingness is in front of you
All you create, comes from the depths of despair

Already the shade is forming
Obscure faces everywhere
Without knowing they walk the same line
Burdened by the curse of existence

Lifeâs system
Comes on
Bright colours
Embrace me
