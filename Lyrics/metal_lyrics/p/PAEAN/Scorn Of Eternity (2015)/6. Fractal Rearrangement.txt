Ashes on barren soil
Residue of annihilation
Consciousness reduced to null
A subject to deprivation
A narrow pathway
To forming the cornerstone
Led by will of materialization
Through carnal destruction
Ashes fill lacerations
Foundation for reformation
Order rises anew
And breathes once more
Embers reanimated
Holding the power of life
The core awakens
The essence of creation
Waves clash on lifeless shores
Endless fields of sorrow
Roots roam across cracks
Blood flowing in their veins
Spores of corruption preserved in grit
Obscured, forgotten reminder of seasons past
Futile suffocation of renewal
The waking hand, outlasting the gift bestowed upon it
Web of amanÃ­tis spreading into vascular roots
Twisted symbiosis giving birth to deformation
No supply of blood, the ground turns putrid black
Cracks torn agape in a violent burst

This illness, rooted deep within
Incurable syndrome of the species
Reconstruction all for naught
Inescapable path towards demise

Let rivers dry
Soil bleed its last
Flames die
Winds howl of pain
