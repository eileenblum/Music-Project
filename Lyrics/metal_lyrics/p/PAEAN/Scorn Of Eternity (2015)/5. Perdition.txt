The eye of light
Shutting its lids
An ancient mass of flesh
The force that rids....

In thick black
Illumination knelt
To her brother, dark
Only tremors can be felt

A stench-ridden body
Hauling itself across
Once perfect purity
Now infested by vermin
Inhuman forms
Rise from murky depths
Manifestation of ancient gloom
Possessing the force of death

Mind degraded to a structure
The long-lived mass of life
Body affected by the rapture
Reduced to human waste
No glimmer of hope to be seen
To save primordiality
The savage beast within me
Eternally feeding on chaos

Weakening legs under pressure
Sinews tear, evoking stillness
Unearthly heat, cracking the skin
Bones revealed, a blinding reflection
Bound to embrace the harsh soil
Become a part of its system
To feed a ravaging plague
Nourish the source of my demise

Ages pass
Static form
Impulse for motion
The last exertion

Endless odyssey
Towards rejuvenation
Destructive prodigy
The eater of worlds

Left blind to scour oblivion
Lost in the void of time
Inescapable spiral
Erosion of existence

-The elements stand still
All life wiped away
-Deafening silence ensues
Immersed in eerie stillness
-In the deep unknown
The ground begins to shift
-The cloak of darkness tears
A pulsing core revealed

Lacerated
Covered in ash
A lifeless sphere
Of madness

Merciless
Cold and true
The transcendence
Into infinity

The ground weeps
For her next of kin
A dying wish
To be revived with no sin

The dust spreads
Long lost lives
And memories fade
To the abyss

I died for their lives
I live in their minds
And I am their stone
Their weight to carry
