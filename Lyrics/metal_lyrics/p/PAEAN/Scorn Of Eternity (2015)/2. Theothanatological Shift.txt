Sarx eternal, the invulnerable cask
Gift of omnipresence, endless being
Infinite nous of origin, divine
Vessel for the astral spirit
Spear strikes to rend a river of life
Aorta pours crimson fuel for flesh
Mindâs comprehension of reality
The primal meaning bestowed upon
Omnipresent being of lies
Finite sarx and deceptive nous
Unfit to be the vessel
Not all-knowing as promised in devotion
Separate from this union
The source of seeming immortality
Let be one being, the vessel of itself
Nous guiding to the end, transmitting reality
Extricated from the sacred dissension
Wisdom attained through mortifying lust
Nothing divine to the hereditary legacy
as the refinement forgets the immortal art
