Theyâve come to ruin my palace
To torch my ethereal kingdom
I am the king in this castle
The king in solitude

The red sea is closing in
A melting tide
A glowing horizon
A blackened sky

The wind carries
A thousand burning embers
A thousand screams of agony
A smell of ruin

In flames, this endless living hall
Becomes a torture chamber
The asphyxiating poison replacing air
I'm breathing death

The deadly red tongue
Licking on my throne
Stinging through my coat
Stopping all my senses

In this pain, my pride, my vigor
Become just empty words
As I'm coming to and end, I realize
I never was the king of anything

So long it has been
That time has twisted
Itself around my center

So far I have traveled
Centuries of knowledge
I have gained

Trees of millennium
I've seen wither

I have no home, no legacy
And no way to justify
That my life's work was
Just myself growing old.

A red collage of death
Burned into my eyes
A vivid image of reality
Until the end will torture me

This end, that I've yearned for, turns vicious
When recalling the past
My throne of dirt, a finite monument

This final breath, that Iâve waited for long
Carried away by a familiar cold
Let the flames consume me

No witness
To my frailness
Buried in the ashes
