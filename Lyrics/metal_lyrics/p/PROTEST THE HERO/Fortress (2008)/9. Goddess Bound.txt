Take everything your parents taught you, throw it to the dogs
It's the forgotten flesh of something dead, its blood drips from your jaws.

Take everything your school has taught you, throw it to the dogs.
It's the meat that dries in summer heat and reeks now of its rot.
It speaks now of the fate that we await, to be forgot.

Just as mountains live outside of rocks 
And time itself outside of clocks.

We hope this life exists beyond our lonely bones in the pine box.
From the bottom of my heart, at the top of my lungs
From the corner of my eye at the tip of my tongue

Take everything your parents taught you, throw it to the dogs
It's the forgotten flesh of something dead, from the bottom of my heart

Take everything your fucking school has taught you, throw it to the dogs.
It's the meat that dries in summer heat and reeks now of its rot.

It's everywhere, it's everywhere, it's everything, it's everyone
It's anywhere, it's anywhere, it's anything, it's anyone

It's the neighbor saving face by saying grace 
Today for yesterday's behavior
It's the neighbor saving face by saying grace 
Today for yesterday's behavior 

Oh my God

Live to fuck and fuck til death
Drink to sorrow and regrets
Live to fuck and fuck til death
Drink to sorrow and regrets
