Did you come here to kill, or did you come here to die?
Did we really think that spaceships would descend from the sky?

Bending light and beaming forth across space-time 
to see us scared in the reflection of their oil black eyes?

And stalk us as a predator like our movies imply

They're not the ones who come to kill us
Come to fill us full of lead
They're not the ones who hate us
And they are not the ones who mutilate our animals
Or travel through the stars.
They're not the ones who cause us harm - we are!
We are, we are, we are

We are still-life in cold blood and we feel nothing.
We are still-life in cold blood and we feel nothing.

Hell-bent on heaven 
Hell-bent on heaven 
Hell-bent on heaven 
Hell-bent on heaven 

While our righteous men are stuffing corpses full of shit and faith, 

We are, we are, we are still-life
We are, we are, we are still-life
We are, we are, we are
Still-life

They're not the ones who cause us harm
We are, we are 
(Did you come here to kill, or did you come here to die?)
We are still-life in cold blood 
We are still-life in cold blood 
And we feel
We feel

Stuffing corpses full of shit and faith, 
They bloviate about a future beyond the moon.
To bring about another planet's doom
To discover peaceful life and beat our war-drum to its tune
Unless my prayers are answered 
Our end is coming soon.
