Awake, unfazed
Morning light tells of the dawning day
Just like any other day
Brush off sleepâs touch
Clear midnight's haze
Thereâs nothing extraordinary here
A flaccid world, unfit, unclear
Desperate for something more
Something more than getting by

Empty faces on the sidewalk
Listless and limping to a lie
Of a bright and pleasant future
Of a blue and cloudless sky
A phantom whisper sounds deceiving
It brings with it the question âwhy?â
We work until we are unable
Then locked away until we die

But then it happened
Everything changed in but an instant
A violent burst of brilliant colour
Somehow close and somehow distant

From a whisper
To a scream
To a hoarse, distorted laugh
There is no hope of restitution
There is no ever going back

In dreamless sleep
One ponders death
Hold back the fleeting final breath
Knuckle white, slipping grip
Jaw clenched tight, and quivering lip
This cannot happen
This cannot be
Escape a life of anonymity
To be a drop into the sea, a drop into the sea

Whose ripple turns to tidal wave
That sweeps the shores it once forgave
But crashing down upon the shore
The sea is silent evermore

Awake, unfazed
Morning light tells of the dawning day
Just like any day.
Brush off sleepâs touch
Clear midnight's haze
Thereâs nothing extraordinary here
A flaccid world, unfit, unclear
Desperate for something more
Something more than getting by

Thereâs got to be something more than this
It sounds so deceiving
Begging the question âwhy?â
Begging the question âwhy?â
Why do we work until we are unable?
Why do we work until we die?
Why do we work until we are unable?
Why, why, why do we work, why do we work until we die?

(A drop into the sea
Whose ripple turns to tidal wave,
And sweeps the shores it once forgave)

The Sun, the Moon, the Earth
Conversed and agreed
The people of the world must pay for its atrophy
But crashing down upon the shore
The sea is silenced evermore

Evermoreâ¦

But then it happened
Everything changed in but an instance
A violent burst of brilliant color

Somehow close and somehow distance [4x]

The sun, the moon, the Earth
Conversed and agreed
The people of the world must pay for its atrophy

(What unknown face now breaks the silence?)

(What tipping force disturbs the balance?)

(Swift and sober, comes a voice, offering a bitter choice)
