Here's lookin' at you, kid
It was gonna leak eventually, so eventually it did
And bad new, travels fast I think
In a moment the country will be stiff, stiff inside their pants

All the editors are hard, all the journalists are wet
All the boys are jerking off in private on the internet

The manager is sweating
The parents smoking cigarettes
And it doesn't matter if the vision flatters
It's the nudity, and that much is understood
(And that much is understood, that much is understood)
And it better be
It fucking better be
It better be good

'Cause she looks hungry on that tape
Yeah, she looks so fine in the limelight
In the sickly green she might have been
A girl I know, a place I've seen

Now all the editors are hard, and all the journalists are wet
And all the boys are jerking off in private on the internet
Now all the editors are hard, and all the journalists are wet
And all the boys are jerking off in private on the internet

Between the sweat and the silhouette
Between the drink and the regret
Have your fill, but don't forget...
Everyone's naked!

Somewhere out there in-ter-net
Somewhere out there in-ter-net

The Jonas generation's got rings wrapped 'round their dicks
The whole world waits with patience for one them boys to slip

Reflected, directed, by one simple fact
Be careful what you're looking at because it might be looking back
Reflected, directed, by one simple fact
Be careful what you're looking at because it might be looking back

In the sickly green she might have been
A girl I know, a place I've seen
In the sickly green she might have been
A fantasy that I foreseen

Yeah!
Get if off, get it off online
Get it off get if off get it off online

Innocently green she might have been
A girl I know or a place I've seen
A girl I know or a place I've seen
