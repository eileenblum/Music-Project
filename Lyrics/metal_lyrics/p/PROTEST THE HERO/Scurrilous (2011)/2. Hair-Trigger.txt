That sweet little redhead's got her hooks in my back
she points her finger and she shows me what i lack
her pale skin, it burns so hot in the midnight air
She paints the streets a shade of gray around my chair so come on in

Her hot breath on my skin
Her scent on my fingers
Her taste is on my mind
It constantly lingers

'Till I can breathe her
'Till I can believe her
'Till I can breathe her
'Till I can leave her

every kiss is a little sickening
i can feel death's fingers quickening
tightening my passage ways
If you can't count the years
Start counting days

Try to remember that she hates you
And though she might elate you
She tries to kill the great that's in you now
She's hand picked the fate that awaits you now
And despite her words, it's not too late

I wrote a Goddamn love song to praise everything I hate
And kids were wanting the chorus line
And they sealed my picture's frame
She might run shit for right now but I'll be damned if it's forever and always

As the chorus-line fades away like friends in high-school hallways

Oh, I got this feeling
That things will never, ever, ever be the same
Things will never be the same

What about those rainy nights in London?
What about the crippling desert heat?
What about all those times you swore you'd never leave me?
What about the hospital in L.A.?
You took me back after that night
What about that blackened image in my mind?
I swear I burn with a new light
What about that frozen, dripping, holiday bird that's cold
She's cold as ice!
