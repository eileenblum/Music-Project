Stepped off a chair so he could learn to let loose, 
learn to let loose before the pendulum wore off
His final sound a gurgle and a cough
And his final words âthe pendulum wore offâ
Stepped off a building to find concrete evidence, 
concrete evidence that heâd ever make an impact
Fiction splattered into fact
And his fiction splattered into another sidewalk painting on display
Stepped off a bridge so he could make a splash, 
to make a splash he had to flounder like a fish out of water
Another lamb that chose the slaughter
Stepped off a chair so he could learn to let loose, 
learn to let loose before the pendulum wore off
His final sound a gurgle and a cough
Stepped off a platform and briefly made the news, 
made the news and made the trains run fifteen minutes late
Oh what a price to pay to be the author of your fate
The trains were fifteen minutes late (to be the author of your fate)
Câest la vie! A drooling old bitch and a house full of lies
Câest la vie! The little things that kill you make you glad to be alive
Câest la vie! Disease in your genes and ocean levels on the rise
Câest la vie! Sing a song of living before everybody dies
