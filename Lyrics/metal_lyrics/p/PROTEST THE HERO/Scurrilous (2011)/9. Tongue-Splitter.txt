Psychotherapist once claimed I had acute neurosis
Well, I only said a couple words and he made his diagnosis
He said I could say whatever I want because I never chose this
So I spat, grinned and I looked at him and blew him a Glasgow kiss, look out now

I close just one eye, and let a part of me die
Never too sure if it's the truth or a lie

I'm not asking for your pity "Oh woe is me" sarcastically
I'm not losing sleep pathetically while waxing so poetically

But I'm waning, waning alphabetically
As I keep dropping bombs
Dropping bombs
Dropping bombs apologetically

It was a wicked whimpering Winnipeg night
when my tongue grew wings and took to flight
the thought had never crossed my mind before that moment
is the truth so bent it can't be broken?

my jealousy got the best of me
and had a conference with the rest of me
it said, "If this is all that's left for me
then there's a little room for regret."
Little voice
Little voice
Little voice inside my head said,
"If you don't regret nothing then you might as well be dead, might as well be dead."

So I apologize,
mostly to the four or five guys
Who stand behind me on the stage every night

as the mic starts to whisper
and the words start to blister
in my mouth that I know aren't right

I gotta get back to who I was before my last ten years on autopilot
It's the mask that quite often starts to eat into your face
So wear it lightly like a cap that can quickly be replaced

I gotta get back to who I was before my last ten years on autopilot

So tell me again how my life should have been before I was spineless
before I gave in
because everybody thinks it's timeless... Well time's running out
One thing I'll never regret is I never shed my face
