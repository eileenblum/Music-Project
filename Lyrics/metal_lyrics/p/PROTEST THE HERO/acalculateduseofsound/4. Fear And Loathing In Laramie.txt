Compassion is shit. Soft-spoken words and a look of concern. The fire is lit. Emotion will never extinguish these flames that inaction has built. What makes it burn? A nation so straight that deviationâs a crime. When will we learn that sexuality is not a punishable offense? On a cold October night, a gentle soul was crucified and what remains of his blood still stains our idle hands that soft-spoken words wonât justify. Culprits are we. Letâs talk about rights. Letâs talk about sexual orientation. Letâs talk about you and an entire homophobic nation. Will you follow me down? Can we not separate ourselves from such hate? Letâs sever the head of the beast with the crown, letâs no longer participate. Will you follow me down? Why wonât anyone stand up?
