I declare a war
a fight for freedom against any system that's built 
to consume our power and maintained to divide our energy. 
A system where an honest person can sweat for hours 
and then play slave to the man in the television tower. 
A system where private ownership erases public health care 
because dollars are worth more than people; dollars are worth more than sense. 
Oh what force on Earth is greater than the mighty strength of one.
it's a one-way street through a faceless crowd; 
barcodes and backlit billboards show us, guide us, 
teach us how to earn our rank, divide the rich and poor, 
pit us against ourselves, compiling and burning corpses of class war.
Yes, I want to topple this system held in place by financial greed 
where wealth is made through ownership and social hierarchy. 
Dollars are worth more than a worker in need,
more than John and Jane Doe with a family to feed.
we are the workers, the majority, and this system fears solidarity. 
So I declare a war on everything they're for
Oh what force on Earth is greater than the mighty strength of one.
it's a one-way street through a faceless crowd; 
barcodes and backlit billboards show us, guide us, 
teach us how to earn our rank, divide the rich and poor, 
pit us against ourselves, compiling and burning corpses of class war. 
Just someone to topple the system.
I want to topple the system
Just someone to topple the system.
