Well place your justice in my palm 
and then I'll make a fist
And punch your grimaced face 
until every knuckle breaks
And bleeds in resistance to my sidewalk painting

A mangled body twitching and regaining consciousness and closure
Attempting composure before a bullet 
in the mouth answers the questions of exposure
And God of Sunday School faÃ§ades 
and paycheques to validate the time I served abroad
(We will say it all means nothing) if I forget why I'm here
To serve and protect my fist over fist 
mind under matter career

That's why this sounds kind of funny 
when he falls to his knees
With his hand on his throat while he begs you to please (spare his life)
Falls to his knees (when he falls to his knees)
Falls to his knees (With his hand on his throat while he begs you to please)

Oh all of this ask for change (change)
While I explain the hardest of bodies dulls the softest of knives

When I hold up his head and carve X's in his eyes
When I hold up his head and carve X's in his eyes
and carve X's in his eyes

I swear I have compassion 
I've just been trained to disregard the prisoner's life
Because I am the prison guard

I swear I have compassion 
I've just been trained to disregard the prisoner's life
Because I am the prison guard
