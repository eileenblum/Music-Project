I better think of my answers now 
because I know the questions will be asked
Like if I brought the joy I found 
in the confessions of a mask
The tip of my tongue's already 
touching the top of my mouth
It's meaning manifest in mercy 
burning down, burning down, 
burning down, burning down, 
burning down, burning down, 
burning down the house

It's true that tactless teem totem-poles 
turn tolerance to tired taboos
It's true that a bullet never knocks on the door, 
it's about to come crashing through

I walking one last mile in big steps as your alter-wine
I'm doing it in tattered shoes that aren't even mine
Because my own are in a box locked up with possessions I can't have
Like the gunman with his future and the prison priest's golden calf

Walking one last mile 
Walking one last mile...

Blindfolds aside I'd probably still close my eyes
And try to feel a trembling fetal life inside 
that shotgun barrel that's about to make me bleed
Like an ulcer in the stomach of the beast

Like a little girl on a bed that was years ago deceased
Resurrected last night with a letter she can't trace

Resurrected to be killed then maybe born again
I'll always be Kezia as long as any hope remains

Resurrected to be killed then maybe born again
I'll always be Kezia as long as any hope remains

Resurrected to be killed and then maybe born again
I'll always be Kezia so long as any hope remains
