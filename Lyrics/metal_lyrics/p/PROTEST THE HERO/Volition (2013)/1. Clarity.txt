Without a word uttered
A comparison is drawn.
A distant future, a cluttered past
Amid the stars.
Vague yet persistent,Â 
Thought lacking consistency.
Unwilling victim of farce.
The loudest voices scream uninspired.
Their numbers vast, their spirits strong.
Quiet choices sing against the choir
The majority is almost never wrong...
Never wrong... Ever... Never wrong.

A laughable assertion
That there might be some connection
(smoke-filled halls)
Adorn the walls with mirrors and misdirection,
Or let it go. [4x]

No common thread,Â 
No ties that bind.
Just grasping at threads and keep in mind.
Historical analysis
They play a separate role,
But one contributes more to the whole!

Like a saucer sep...
Let's separate and shuffle off this conflict.
My armament will suffocate (will suffocate),
And leave you feeling useless.

We are your beginningÂ 
And we will be your end.
Affluence permitting, a mutual annihilation.

A laughable assertion
That there might be some connection
(smoke-filled halls)
Adorn the walls with mirrors and misdirection,
Or let it go. [4x]

Discussion moot
Argument ended
An aggressive mute
Strumbling defendant
Fiction versus fantasy
One fact remains unclear
How you pretend both franchises stand soley on one tier?!

We are your beginningÂ 
And we will be your end.
Affluence permitting, a mutual annihilation.

I don't care who shot first
Or for the song and dance you've rehearsed.
(a mutual annihilation)
I don't care who shot first,
Or for the song and dance that you've rehearsed.

The maps are divided
And each are traversed.
Aligment in flux for better or worse.
Is the drain finally swirlingÂ or are we swirling the drain?
This drought is relieved with acid rain.

This drought is relieved with acid rain. [3x]

(we are) We are your beginning (and the end)
And we will be your end (we will be your end) [2x]

Affluence permitting a mutual annihilation
