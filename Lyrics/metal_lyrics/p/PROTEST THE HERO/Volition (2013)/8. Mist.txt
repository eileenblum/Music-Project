Â Â 
About a gunshot away thereâs a place that I long to be -
tippinâ bottles with me old cock.Â 
When the shitâs all said and sorted, I plan to settle down and stay -Â 
one middle finger to the landlocked.Â 
From the first time boatinâ or thereâs not too much I can recall.Â 
I kissed a plastic cod and drank rum till I was friggered.Â 
I decided then and there that Iâd return, even if I had to crawl.Â 
Something outside was broken and something inside me, triggered.Â 

Itâs a long ride home, but itâs always my destination.
Itâs a long ride home.Â 

If the sun bursts apart at the end of the world, I donât think I will give a damnÂ 
as long as Iâm surrounded by friends and pints in goddamned Newfoundland.Â 
So hereâs to Newfoundland.Â 

I breathed a sigh of relief the next time steppinâ off the plane.Â 
Itâd been a long, hard, vapid winter.Â 
Johnny and the boys were waiting there ready to explain,Â 
they werenât there to drive us, just a welcome back to the Island.Â 
So we taxied to the venue to prepare for the night to sweep.
Slept in the back room until the India showed up.Â 
When we finally took the stage, it shifted beneath our feet.Â 
We stood on the shoulders of proud Newfoundlanders.

I think it bears repeating
I think it bears repeatingÂ 
I think it bears repeating that no one buckled under.Â 
We all got bit by the cod that we all kissed.Â 
It left an infection in our lips and a longing in the mist.Â 

Youâre as deep as the grave, and youâre marching to the heartbeat of the land.
Youâre as deep as the grave, and youâre marching to the heartbeat of the land.
Yes, I be a Newfoundlander Bây. Not by birth, but in my heart. Yes, I be a Newfoundlander Bây.
Yes, I be a Newfoundlander Bây. Not by birth, but in my heart. Yes, I be a Newfoundlander Bây.
Youâre as deep as the grave, and youâre marching to the heartbeat of the land.
Youâre as deep as the grave, and youâre marching to the heartbeat of the land.
