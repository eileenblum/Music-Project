So how you fuckinâ feeling tonight?Â 
Weâre (insert name here) from unimportant,Â 
and Iâm about to mimic some image of a rock and roll singer I have under lock and key.Â 
Without the faintest hint of ironyÂ 
that Iâm flashing my pearly whites to sustain my mediocrity.Â 
So is everyone having a good time tonight?Â 
Good, Iâm glad (I couldnât actually care less).Â 
You guys are the best crowd that weâve ever seen,Â 
seen with these old dead eyes.Â 
Blind to the stage or even my own lies.Â 

So hey ho, letâs go. Letâs start this contemptible ârockâ show.Â 
Blinding lights to hide the hand up our ass in this puppet-sock show.Â 
Two sewn on eyes, repurposed and made new,Â 
torn from an aging suit for a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu.Â 
Thumb underbite. I bite my fucking thumb,Â 
and hope you catch a thread, and slowly come undone.Â 

An illusion seldom spoken. An understanding between you and IÂ 
that the ground that you stand on is somehow less than mine.Â 
An allusion to a broken home,Â 
left on the street and chilled to the bone.Â 
So hey, we still feeling good?Â 
Now you comprehend our complex relationshipâconsumer/consumed.Â 
Youâre just some stupid kid and Iâm a megalomaniac.Â 

Shedding defenses for an honest creation.Â 
Placing yourself in the stocks on the strap.Â 
Youâre disgracing your effort by conforming to textbookÂ 
performance of music to fill in the gaps,Â 
and itâs bullshit.Â 
Itâs bullshit. Be honest, this canât be what you wanted,Â 
if what you write about means anything to you.Â 
Rather than pure vanity, people might connect with sincerity.Â 
Donât just pray the next generation learns from our mistakes.Â 
Letâs not repackage the same old performance.Â 
Original content is so much more rewarding.Â 
Letâs not repackage the same old performance.Â 
Original content is so much more rewarding.Â 
I know that it might be quite clichÃ©,Â 
but if all the world is in fact a stage,Â 
then this stageâthis here goddamn stageâÂ 
might just be all the world.
