why don't we see?
we're enslaving ourselves while drowning in our luxury.
Is it just me?
Or do we take advantage or our privilaged society?
why?
it isn't fucking right.
it's our choice,
the wrong one leads us to regression and despondancy.
Take what you need
and leave the rest for those in need who live and die in poverty.

what have we become?
a consuming machine in a useless regime.
and what did we expect
a generation raised by tv and taught to neglect
