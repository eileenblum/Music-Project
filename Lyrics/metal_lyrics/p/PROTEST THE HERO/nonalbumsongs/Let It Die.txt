6 billion minds, controlled by one
10,000 more, stare down the barrel of a gun
annihilation by a system of our own design
your definition of freedom, my friend, needs to be redefined

a quality, or a state of being free
your absense of necessity brings a country to its knees
and your slavedrivin way of government wears the mask of democracy
and the way you abuse your leadership my friend, doesn't make much sense to me

Watch, watch it die, let it burn, watch your empires crumble

Watch your empires
watch them die
die by the hands of you
