Without diversity, in our society
where the hell would we stand?
we whine and complain, about things we will never explain
instead of dealing with the problems at hand
I strongly believe, that the fight has begun
its hard to repair the damage we've done
if you haven't yet guess, I'm speaking of yes
this ignorance that we ignore

and this lack of respect,
if enough to make me sick
and no I won't get over it
until you stop treating me like shit
