Blood stained faces bodies torn apart.
Tear stained eyes and fists clenched longing for revenge. 
Bearded men gun - toting men 
chanting praises to their god,
screaming "Martyrs never Die." 

Is it true that a picture says a thousand words?
or in our case is it a thousand lies? 

Our eyes, Our Ears 
in the Foreign world are just a source of Glowing facades
more deaf and dumb then us ourselves. 

I'd rather blame the oppressor, 
than blame the oppressed. 

Darkness cloaks the Holy Land 
sprinkled with asperity of sin 
now tell me when will they be free? 

Our eyes, Our ears 
in the foreign world are just a source of glowing facades 
more deaf and dumb then us ourselves. 

Everyday we flip through the channels expecting the truth, 
but what do we see? 
the vilified become the victims 
and the oppressors become the oppressed. 

How can we live our lives? 
How can we sleep at night? 
Knowing that our brothers and sisters in humanity
are being stripped of their homes. 
I'm asking you to stand up and make a difference, 
cause it's pretty clear that the only solution is liberation. 

Our eyes our ears 
in the foreign world are just a source of glowing facades 
more deaf and dumb than us ourselves. 

"Martyrs never DIE!"
