religion is killing all over the place
everyone is striving to be the master race
you fight for your freedom and you kill for peace
but your whole damn cause is hypocrisy.

how many more must die
how long until we realize
why must we all take sides
what are we fighting for we've lost all reason why

can't take your holy war
tired of your bullshit
I can't take it anymore

FUCK YOU!

I Hate You Hate We Hate War
What the hell are we fighting for

Thou shalt not kill
can't even abide by your own rules
