lives will be lost, and children will die.
but in response our nation does nothing but lie.
a silent genocide with a country at stake,
how many more innocent lives will we take.
Until we realize who exactly is to blame,
should we bomb ourselves for the economic sanctions that we've made?
stripping them of essentials and their primary basic needs,
just to get to one man and we wonder who's destroying the peace.

and this counties indigence, is no fault but our own
and the people are dying, to see one man overthrown

it wasn't how many bombs we dropped it was the places we targeted
their healthcare, their water, their power their food,...
their livelihood.
stripping them of essentials and their primary basic needs,
just to get to one man and we wonder who's destroying the peace.

and this countries indigence, is no fault but our own
and the people are dying, to see one man overthrown
and the media spins us, a tangled web of lies
while we search for the truth
another child dies.

another child dies, adds to your death toll,
how many more, children must die
another child dies adds to your death toll,
how many more, bodies will lie
another child dies adds to your death toll,
how many more, children must die
another child dies adds to your death toll,
how long until......
we take away they're lives
