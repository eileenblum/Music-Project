[Intro]
With an edge that cuts more than any knife,
Here to pass any trend or a shelf life.
Giving up is easy to do,
But easy wonât show we have something to prove.

[Verse 1]
Your sticks, your stone, your words are all useless,
My flesh and bone, my focus is ruthless.
Wasting your breath, Iâm ready to die for,
Something that puts it all on the line.
Iâm not gonna stay the same,
The whole damn world is stuck in a phase.
Iâd rather fail standing out of the crowd,
At least I did it myself.

[Chorus]
Afraid of your shadow when no one is there.
Dare to be someone different, never blending in.
You set us up just to watch us fall,
The look on your face really says it all.
They can call it what they want,
Iâm gonna prove them wrong.

[Verse 2]
Thrown out like trash, deserted like outcasts.
No trust, no hope, no faith, they want me in the ground.
But I clawed my way out,
Dug through the dirt, all you did was doubt.
So whatchya gotta say, gotta say now,
The cards were stacked and I knocked them down.

[Chorus]
Afraid of your shadow when no one is there.
Dare to be someone different, never blending in.
You set us up just to watch us fall,
The look on your face really says it all.
They can call it what they want,
Iâm gonna prove them wrong.

[Bridge]
You left me when I needed you most,
Now Iâm gonna shove it right down your throat.
You left me when I needed you most,
Now Iâm gonna shove it right down your throat.
Choke on this!
Cho-cho-cho-cho-cho-oke on this!
Choke on this!
Cho-cho-cho-cho-cho-oke on this!

[Chorus]
Afraid of your shadow when no one is there.
Dare to be someone different, never blending in.
You set us up just to watch us fall,
The look on your face really says it all.
They can call it what they want,
Iâm gonna prove them wrong.

[Outro]
Call it what they want,
Iâm gonna prove them wrong.
Call it what they want,
Iâm gonna prove them wrong!
