[feat. Champs][Verse 1]
There was a time I wouldâve given my life
For another day with your touch.
Never quite added up,
The way you made such a fuss
About nothing at all.

[Chorus]
I thought you were crazy in love,
But you were just crazy, oh, oh.
I was pushed to the edge,
Cleaning somebodyâs mess,
Well never again will I let you
Fuck with my head (my head, head, head, head, head, head,
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head)
Will I let you fuck with my head
Will I let you fuck with my head

I thought you were crazy in love,
But you were just crazy, oh, oh.
I was pushed to the edge,
Cleaning somebodyâs mess,
Well never again will I let you fuck with my head.

[Verse 1: Champs]
From the girls to the government,
Your boy Champs see the world on some other shit.
Scotty gotta beam me up to the mother ship,
I'm runninâ undercover but I'm one of them runninâ it.
And I'm wonderinâ if this is not
Just another fake slumber from which I will arise.
I am a problem, a threat and a virus
In the eyes of your government, eyes of your god.
In the eyes of your god.
In the eyes of your, god.
I am a problem, a threat and a virus
In the eyes of your government, eyes of your god.

[Hook]
You could say what you really want, no.
You could say but you really won't know.
You could say what you really want,
But you really won't,
Cause you really don't know, no
You could say what you really want, no.
You could say but you really won't know.
You could say what you really want,
But you really won't,
Cause you really don't know, no

[Bridge]
You had me going,
Without a warning,
You turned into someone else.
Maybe I was blind,
Couldnât see all the signs,
But now I see so damn clear.

[Chorus]
I thought you were crazy in love,
But you were just crazy, oh, oh.
I was pushed to the edge,
Cleaning somebodyâs mess,
Well never again will I let you
Fuck with my head (my head, head, head, head, head, head,
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head)
Will I let you fuck with my head
Will I let you fuck with my head

I thought you were crazy in love,
But you were just crazy, oh, oh.
I was pushed to the edge,
Cleaning somebodyâs mess,
Well never again will I let you fuck with my head.

[Outro]
Fuck with my, fuck with my, fuck with my head
Fuck with my, fuck with my, fuck with my head
Fuck with my, fuck with my, fuck with my head
Fuck with my, fuck with my, fuck with my head
