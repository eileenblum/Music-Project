[feat. Garret Rapp][Verse 1]
Do you remember the first time that we met?
You were cold as a ghost in a basement,
You wanted nothing to do with me or the world around you.

[Pre-Chorus]
You said Iâm not someone you wanna waste your time on,
I said youâre not someone I wanna say goodbye to.

[Chorus]
Funny feeling how it all can flip,
Picking you up really picks me up.
Look at how we turned a spark into a flame,
Lighting you up really lights me up.
And all the pills and sympathy
Wonât replace what you know you need.
I know it feels like youâve got nothing,
Bet you didnât know you were all I see.

[Verse 2]
You said youâre damaged merchandise and Iâll pay the price,
If I let you in,
You can go and try to push it off all you want,
But Iâm never giving up,
Iâll show you what youâre worth!

[Pre-Chorus]
You said Iâm not someone you wanna waste your time on,
I said youâre not someone I wanna say goodbye to.
If youâre a fire then I wanna burn!

[Chorus]
Funny feeling how it all can flip,
Picking you up really picks me up.
Look at how we turned a spark into a flame,
Lighting you up really lights me up.
And all the pills and sympathy
Wonât replace what you know you need.
I know it feels like youâve got nothing,
Bet you didnât know you were all I see.

[Hook: Garret Rapp]
Have I accepted that I will never trust again,
When I can't even seem to trust myself?
How am I ever gonna trust again?
Why do I stay on the roads that keep leading me right back through the hell I've been?
Thereâs a difference between giving up,
And knowing when you've had enough,
Maybe I'm addicted to you because the best kinds of drugs are other people like us

[Bridge]
I found out the best kinds of drugs are people just like us!

[Chorus]
Funny feeling how it all can flip,
Picking you up really picks me up.
Look at how we turned a spark into a flame,
Lighting you up really lights me up.
And all the pills and sympathy
Wonât replace what you know you need.
I know it feels like youâve got nothing,
Bet you didnât know you were all I see.
