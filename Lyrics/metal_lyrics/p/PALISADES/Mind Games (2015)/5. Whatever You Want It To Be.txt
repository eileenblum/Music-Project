[Intro]
Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.
Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.
Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.

[Verse 1]
I, knew always,
Iâd be the taste on your lips,
Thatâd make you sick to death.
You, knew always,
Iâd be the mark on your chest
That youâd never forget.

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately youâve been killing me, killing me.
We were, we were meant to be, meant to be.
You were the breath I would take in my lungs,
And now you think that weâre better alone.

[Chorus]
I thought we had it all,
Somewhere we lost control.
Well we all make mistakes and this oneâs on me,
I became what you hate, what you feared Iâd be.
Now Iâm in the dark,
Since we fell apart.
Now Iâm caught in between every memory,
I have done all I can, but you still wonât let me in.

Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.
Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.
Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.

[Verse 2]
Smoke in your lungs,
Couldnât care less if I light you up.
Selfish motivationâs what tore us up,
And now youâve seen enough.

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately youâve been killing me, killing me.
We were, we were meant to be, meant to be.
You were the breath I would take in my lungs,
And now you think that weâre better alone.

[Chorus]
I thought we had it all,
Somewhere we lost control.
Well we all make mistakes and this oneâs on me,
I became what you hate, what you feared Iâd be.
Now Iâm in the dark,
Since we fell apart.
Now Iâm caught in between every memory,
I have done all I can, but you still wonât let me in.

Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.
Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.

[Bridge]
Itâs like a foreign tongue, we donât speak the same
Boys talking down, Iâve got them diamonds in my mouth.
Itâs like a different story on a different page.

[Chorus]
I thought we had it all,
Somewhere we lost control.
Well we all make mistakes and this oneâs on me,
I became what you hate, what you feared Iâd be.
Now Iâm in the dark,
Since we fell apart.
Now Iâm caught in between every memory,
I have done all I can, but you still wonât let me in.
