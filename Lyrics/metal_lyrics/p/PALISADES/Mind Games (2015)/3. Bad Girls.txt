[Intro]
Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga
Got âem all wet, shakin' what they mama gave âem

[Verse 1]
Make no mistake about it; she is dangerous.
Iâm ready for the punishment; she ties me up.
Cause sheâs got the hottest vibe and the body to ride.
[Pre-Chorus]
Workinâ the floor like itâs her nine to five.
Sheâs the type of girl who knows just what she wants,
All the dudes are tryna pick their mouths off the floor.

Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga...
Got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga
Got âem all wet

[Chorus]
Let âem sweat it all they want, give it all they got,
We got a good thing,
They donât know itâs a good thing.
Let âem sweat it all they want, give it all they got,
Cause I canât wait to get you home,
No I canât wait to get you all alone.

Got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet,
Got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet, g-got âem all wet,
Shakin' what they mama gave âem.

[Verse 2]
Iâll say the things that they wonât say,
And Iâll do the things that make your legs shake.
[Pre-Chorus]
Workinâ the floor like itâs her nine to five.
Sheâs the type of girl who knows just what she wants,
All the dudes are tryna pick their mouths off the floor.

[Chorus]
Let âem sweat it all they want, give it all they got,
We got a good thing,
They donât know itâs a good thing.
Let âem sweat it all they want, give it all they got,
Cause I canât wait to get you home,
No I canât wait to get you all alone.

Let âem sweat it all they want, give it all they got,
We got a good thing,
They donât know itâs a good thing.
Let âem sweat it all they want, give it all they got,
Cause I canât wait to get you home,
No I canât wait to get you all alone.

[Outro]
To get you all alone.
Sheâs going home with me,
Sheâs going home with me,
Sheâs going home with me.
Theyâll never believe so Iâm making them see!
Sheâs going home with me,
Theyâll never believe so Iâm making them see!
Sheâs going home with me,
Theyâll never believe so Iâm making them see!

Got âem all wet!
