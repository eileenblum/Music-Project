[feat. blackbear]A lot of people need a lot of attention
They say some shit like it has an effect on me
Youâre so obsessed with looking down
You eat sleep breathe my name in your mouth
Expectations low but I feel high
Never fit the mold, fuck getting by
I wanna hear how much you hate me
How my existence drives you crazy
Iâd rather be a fucking thorn in your side
Than listen to you tell me how to live my life
I bet youâre so proud
Talk is cheap and I donât hear a sound

Letâ em talk talk talk
While I walk walk walk
The more you speak the less I listen
Talk talk talk
While I walk walk walk away
Youâve got nothing on me
Why waste your breath
Why waste your words
They mean nothing to me
Talk talk talk
While I walk walk walk away
While I walk away

What do you have to say
While youâre sitting alone
Iâve been building a throne
So confident in what you donât know
The only truth is that youâre still unknown

[blackbear:]
If this walls could speak
Would they mention your name
The attention you seek
So blind and alone you are
I think you see to believe
Itâs like drowning to breathe
At least Iâm breathing in something but smoke
From the burning debris
Of a faint memory
Watch the flames take the place of a home

So think again when you try to speak
Wolves donât lose sleep on the thoughts of sheep
