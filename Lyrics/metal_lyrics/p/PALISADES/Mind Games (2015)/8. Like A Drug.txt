[Intro]
I, I know deep down that this isnât good for me.
I, I know your love is a battlefield!
(Like a drug, I just canât get enough.
Like a drug, I just canât give you up.)
(Like a drug, I just canât get enough.
Like a drug, I just canât give you up.)

[Verse 1]
Lately all these situations,
Keep getting me in every confrontation.
I feel the tension in your body rising up again,
We always end up saying that weâre better off as friends.
Lately every time you wanna change,
We keep getting twisted up in wicked games.

[Pre-Chorus]
But maybe if I try to close my eyes,
Itâll bring me back when we were more alive!

[Chorus]
But I know, deep down that this isnât good for me.
I, I know, deep down that Iâm scared Iâll never leave.
Cause youâve been using me when you know that Iâm weak,
Well Iâve had enough of these wounds,
I, I know your love is a battlefield!

Run that shit back.
(Like a drug, I just canât get enough.
Like a drug, I just canât give you up.)
(Like a drug, I just canât get enough.
Like a drug, I just canât give you up.)

[Verse 2]
Save me from this temptation,
Itâs killing me and I donât wanna face it.
Time after time we find ourselves on a different page,
Look at the signs and draw the line and go our separate ways.

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone turned out all the lights,
Thereâs no bringing us back to life!
But maybe if I try to close my eyes,
Itâll bring me back when we were more alive!

[Chorus]
But I know, deep down that this isnât good for me.
I, I know, deep down that Iâm scared Iâll never leave.
Cause youâve been using me when you know that Iâm weak,
Well Iâve had enough of these wounds,
I, I know your love is a battlefield!

[Hook]
I think Iâm better off alone.
Iâm doing better on my own.
So let it be!
I think Iâm better off alone.
Iâm doing better on my own.
So let it be!

[Chorus]
But I know, deep down that this isnât good for me.
I, I know, deep down that Iâm scared Iâll never leave.
Cause youâve been using me when you know that Iâm weak,
Well Iâve had enough of these wounds.
I, I know your love is a battlefield!

[Outro]
Run that shit back.
(Like a drug, I just canât get enough.
Like a drug, I just canât give you up.)
(Like a drug, I just canât get enough.
Like a drug, I just canât give you up.)
