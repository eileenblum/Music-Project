[Verse 1]
The one thing
We canât ever change is free will,
We canât dwell on it.
Even though
it gets hard to breathe
It feels heavy on me, it feels heavy

[Pre-Chorus]
But Iâll sleep tonight, I will sleep tonight,
A dark cloud hangs over things that you said.
Sleep tonight, I will sleep tonight,
Knowing I canât let it get in my head.

[Chorus]
Ohh, whateverâs gonna be, let it happen.
Ohh, canât control what cannot be contained!
Ohh, and when youâre left for dead, show âem whatâs left.
Ohh, when itâs dark you cannot be afraid!

[Verse 2]
Canât explain
How people change,
From so close to so far away.
It's so fast
How it can go from a
Dream to a nightmare.

[Pre-Chorus]
But Iâll sleep tonight, I will sleep tonight,
Knowing that I can depend on myself.
sleep tonight, I will sleep tonight,
Knowing that I wonât be anyone else.

[Chorus]
Ohh, whateverâs gonna be, let it happen.
Ohh, canât control what cannot be contained!
Ohh, and when youâre left for dead, show âem whatâs left.
Ohh, when itâs dark you cannot be afraid!

[Pre-Chorus]
But Iâll sleep tonight, I will sleep tonight,
Knowing that I can depend on myself.
sleep tonight, I will sleep tonight,
Knowing that I wonât be anyone else.

[Chorus]
Ohh, whateverâs gonna be, let it happen.
Ohh, canât control what cannot be contained!
Ohh, and when youâre left for dead, show âem whatâs left.
Ohh, when itâs dark you cannot be afraid!

[Outro]
When itâs dark you cannot be afraid!
