[Verse 1]
You caught the light from my eyes,
I must be losing my mind.
You take my breath away and I donât do this normally,
Iâll take a chance and show you everything that we could be.
Iâm not the one to chase,
I might never see you again.
Iâll take the leap if I can,
Canât let you go without my hand.

[Pre-Chorus]
So Iâm doing something that I never do,
Working up the nerve to go and talk to you.
Down a couple shots before they kick us out,
Itâs too late to turn around,
So Iâll tell her like.

[Chorus]
Ohh!
Cause you know Iâm just a little too drunk,
To be talking like this.
If I donât then Iâll regret it,
With someone like you, so amazing.
Ohh!
Cause you know Iâm just a little fucked up,
To be acting like this.
Ditch your friends and who you came with,
Let me show you some things that I canât explain.
(I canât explain)

[Verse 2]
Let me whisper into your ear and tell ya,
How you put other girls to shame.
Come with me after this,
To an after party, miss.
Where nobody is invited except you and your hips.
I think weâve got the chemistry,
To make this thing take shape.
Donât you?

[Pre-Chorus]
So Iâm doing something that I never do,
Working up the nerve to go and talk to you.
Down a couple shots before they kick us out,
Itâs too late to turn around,
So Iâll tell her like.

[Chorus]
Ohh!
Cause you know Iâm just a little too drunk,
To be talking like this.
If I donât then Iâll regret it,
With someone like you, so amazing.
Ohh!
Cause you know Iâm just a little fucked up,
To be acting like this.
Ditch your friends and who you came with,
Let me show you some things that I canât explain.

[Hook]
Iâm sure you get this all the time,
I donât mean to be out of line,
Donât walk away, donât walk away.
I wanna finish what we start,
I wanna take all of your heart,
Donât walk away, donât walk away.
I wanna feel your touch,
I wanna know youâre mine,
I wonât ask too much!

[Bridge]
Cause you know Iâm just a little too drunk,
To be talking like this.
If I donât then Iâll regret it,
Won't forget a night like this!

[Chorus]
Ohh!
Cause you know Iâm just a little too drunk,
To be talking like this.
If I donât then Iâll regret it,
With someone like you, so amazing.
Ohh!
Cause you know Iâm just a little fucked up,
To be acting like this.
Ditch your friends and who you came with,
Let me show you some things that I canât explain.
