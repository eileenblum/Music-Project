[Verse 1]
I woke up in the city,
Where the streets have chains
And the nights have fangs.
They wanna keep you,
Suck you into the dark,
Leaving marks on your heart.

[Pre-Chorus]
Home,
Itâs the only place I can ever go.
Home,
Itâs the only place I can feel my soul.

[Chorus]
Youâre all I need, youâre everything,
The piece of me thatâs leaving me.
Take us back so we can see
The perfect scenes,
Take me back.

Take me back..
Take me back...

[Verse 2]
You think Iâm crazy,
But if I stay awhile,
Would you replace me?
Place donât erase me.
Donât hang me up on the wall
Like some kind of painting.

[Pre-Chorus]
Home,
Itâs the only place I can ever go.
Home,
Itâs the only place I can feel my soul.

[Chorus]
Youâre all I need, youâre everything,
The piece of me thatâs leaving me.
Take us back so we can see
The perfect scenes,
Take me back.

Take me back...
Take me back home.
[?]
Home

[Chorus]
Youâre all I need, youâre everything,
The piece of me thatâs leaving me.
Take us back so we can see
The perfect scenes,
Take me back.
