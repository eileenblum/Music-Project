[featuring Tyler "Telle" Smith of The Word Alive]Stand up for something worth fighting for!
We're not going down without a fight!
Stand up!
You're never gonna take us alive!

Well excuse me while I catch my breath,
I never thought that this could happen.
I would've guessed that our own death
would have come from our own actions.
Oh the urgency.
The emergency.

Oh my God, look at what's become.
It's them or us or it's over, it's them or us my brother.
God, look at what they've done.
It's them or us or it's over, it's them or us my brother.

Pardon me while I begin to process this information.
Tyrants reigning from the sky,
destroying all our nations.
"Where is your God now?"
They said to "Bow down"
I guess it's time for us to rise up and raise arms!

Nowhere to run to,
no point in hiding.
Our existence has been misguided.
Now we must try to defend all our lives.

[Telle Smith:]
It's now or never stand up for something worth fighting for.
We're not going down without a fight
Stand up!
You're never gonna take us alive!
