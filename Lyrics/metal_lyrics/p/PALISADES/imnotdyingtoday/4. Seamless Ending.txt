Yeah Iâve got some demons
That Iâve gotta cast out
And thereâs a preacher standing beside me
Looking at me with his doubt
because I know when I go
to meet my fate
Iâll be staring down God
at the pearly gates
and when he sees me
will He see me?
cause Iâve made some bad decisions
Iâve made some grim mistakes
and all Iâm asking 
and all Iâm praying
is to bless me with your grace
Cause Iâve been waiting on a dream
Iâve been waiting for something more
Iâve been waiting on a seamless ending
Yeah I need an angel
To stop me from going down
Donât wanna be stuck underground
cause when the devilâs on your shoulder
you learn as you get older
whispers in your ear
the things you want to hear
and even though you know itâs not a cure
youâll say âkeep em comingâ more and more
I was young
I didnât have a care
Thought Iâd get out of here
Oh, how wrong I was
I didnât have a care
and now Iâm stuck in here
Now Iâm stuck in this nightmare
That I canât wake up
Every day is just another rut
Iâm stuck in here
But my dreamâs out there
