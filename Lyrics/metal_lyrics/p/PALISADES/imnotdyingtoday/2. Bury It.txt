There goes another one 
I never wanted it to be this way
But you know that I'll never change 
And I will always stay the same
Red lips pushing all across my fingertips
My hands on your back they begin to grip 
And I will always stay the same I'll never change

Well baby it's a curse that I'm damned 
To forever hold the hand 
Of lust and greed, it's too tempting for me 
And that's all I'll let you know 
For right now

Your sweet skin I feel you shaking as you pull me in 
I lock the door and then we begin
And you're all I want for now 
But don't mistake me 
I don't want to be your everything
You should know that you're just a routine 
And you're all I want for now

Well baby it's a curse that I'm damned 
To forever hold the hand 
Of lust and greed, it's too tempting for me 
And that's all I'll let you know 
For right now

I'll keep you tongue tied 
So the words won't have to fail you
I'll keep your lips locked 
So the words won't have to leave your mouth

I never wanted it to be this way 
I thought that I could change

Well baby it's a curse that I'm damned 
To forever hold the hand 
Of lust and greed, it's too tempting for me 
And that's all I'll let you know 

Well baby it's a curse that I'm damned 
To forever hold the hand 
Of lust and greed, it's too tempting for me 
And that's all I'll let you know 
For right now
