Damn it all to hell
I lost the map 
From last time that I took this trip
And I forgot just where I fell
And now I can just never tell
Where it is I stand
I lost myself from the first time that I took you in
And you forgot how hard you fell
And now youâre just starting to sell your self short of the

Mistakes that I never wanted you to make
Youâve become what they crave
Wolves will eat your skin
If you let them in
Youâre a child in the corner
So Iâm setting up some borders
To keep in my sanity
Iâm escaping from your fantasy

Here I go again
I find me standing
In the same place just where I began
Never knowing up from down
Only that Iâll hit the ground
Damn it wheres my head?
I find me fast awake laying in my bed
And even in my sleep
Iâm grinding at my teeth

So whatâs the point?
So prove your point

Just like the current
Of the ocean
Pulling ourselves back and forth
A compass that has no direction
Never knowing what is north
I need to be
The remedy
Before itâs just too late
Iâm wondering
If theres a cure
And how much weâll have to take

I never wanted to be this lonely
I never thought about what was at stake
You never thought about molding yourself
Now Iâm left with my hands of clay
