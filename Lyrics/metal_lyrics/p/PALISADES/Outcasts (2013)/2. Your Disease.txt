I never seem to catch me right before I hit the floor
I never seem to get me, and I'm coming back for more

I can't get it right, self medicated
Dive down the bottle of the substance I've created
Bag of excuses, and I feel useless
Do you know how it feels to be hollowed out?
Cause I'm drowning, just to catch my breath
I'm drowning till there's nothing left,
There's nothing left, and I'm about to drown here
Do you hear me yet?
Drowning, just to catch my breath

I'm at the starting line when I've been left behind,
You all keep going and going until I'm out of time

Is this Medicine enough to cure?
Bring me to be your disease
and I won't be cured
Bring me to be your disease

I never seem to catch me right before I hit the floor
I never seem to get me, and I'm coming back for more
Drowning just to catch my breath
I'm drowning till there's nothing left, there's nothing left

Get up, get up, get up

When you're down to nothing you always look for something
Even if it means you become your own disease

So hold me closer, I need something to make me feel, to make me feel again
