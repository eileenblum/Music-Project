I can feel your heart as it's racing
It's me rearranging
And all the times that you said you'd stay with me
I should've known that you'd just get up and leave

I kept myself bound to a cancer that only ate up my soul
and all the years in that I gave her only did singe my skin with holes
cigarette burns to my brain are the last impression that you gave
and it's a shame that your only claim to fame is that you're listed with my name

I can feel your heart as it's racing
It's me rearranging
And all the times that you said you'd stay with me
I should've known that you'd just get up and leave
So now it's me that I'm changing, I'm not going to take it
C'mon and taste this, go on get wasted
You're using me so I'll burn away

The truth I found out keeps me up all night, it's not right, it's not right.
Go back where you belong
So get back on your knees
Get back on your knees
like you've always done

So we can never be a couple hun,
Fuck love, all I've got for you is two fingers pointed up!
