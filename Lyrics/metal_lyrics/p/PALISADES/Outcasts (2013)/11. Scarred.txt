And I crept through your head
Just to settle the score
Thought you were done but you wanted more
The satisfaction that I'll get my mind
Is knowing that you couldn't ever really leave me behind
Payback is always best served cold,
I took a page from your book just to torture your soul
Payback is always best served cold,
So take a step back and watch your fate unfold

Cause I don't wanna stop control
And I don't wanna loose my hold
You'll never find a way, never find a way,
You wont escape the mess you've made
Cause I don't wanna stop control
And I don't wanna loose my hold
You'll never get away, never getaway,
From the choices that you've made

Whoa, look into my eyes
Can't you see the damage done
Where will you run when you have no one left to love?

You don't know the person you are
What you have done
I'll make my mark
I'll scar
