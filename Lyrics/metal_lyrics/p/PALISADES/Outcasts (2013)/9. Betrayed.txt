And I'm as empty as they come
a remnant of a ship that once sailed
never ever finding shore
welcomed the water in and then I begged for more
I feel nothing, I don't wanna feel a damn thing
A ghost of who I used to be
Forever haunting halls only to remind you of me

No matter how you spin this, I keep looking for myself
In the dark with no lantern, the only flames I found were hell

Whoa
Torturing myself
Whoa
Looking to find
Whoa
A little bit of remedy, remember when you were mine? You were mine

You know that you kill me, in every way
Whoa
I gave up everything. Is wrong to want you to stay?

I've got nothing left to give
You took advantage of me when I just took you in
and now I'm standing alone and I can finally see
You're the fucking enemy!

Please I'm begging you
I'm begging you to stay

The love, the lies, the sex, the pain
the life you left, the hate in me
