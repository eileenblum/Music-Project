I tend to think about the worst of outcomes
What you feel is fake what you feel is fake
My mind makes up so many problems
Just get over it
You just don't get it cause my past is haunting
And I'm obsessed with all kinds of ugly
Looked down on by society
Does anyone get me

To be heard is all that I want
Like a message in a bottle
Will I ever be caught?
When is it enough

Whoa
What's wrong with me?
Am I over reacting?
No-oh there has to be
A consequence for me

It's a fact that I'm going crazy
Searching for solitude just to getaway
Do we deserve to live this way?
Constantly ridiculed by those that say
We are the outcasts

Cause we, we are the outcasts, yeah!

Whoa
What's wrong with me?
Am I over reacting?
No-oh there has to be
A consequence for me
And I'm afraid that I just won't fit in
It's a battle that I've always had within
No-oh there has to be
A consequence for me

Sometimes, I can't help feeling like I'm the one in the wrong
So lost, I can't find my place in this crowded room
But I, I know in the end I'm not alone
And I, I know in the end I'll find my way back home.
