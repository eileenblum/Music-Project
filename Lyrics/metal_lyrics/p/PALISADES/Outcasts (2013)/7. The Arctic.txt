And I walked a thin line
Just get away from me, get away from me
And I can not define
The meaning of what I did this time
I'm nothing but an endless joke
And everything goes up in smoke
I'm dancing with the devil
I'm broken in pieces
A sad excuse for a man
Hope that you can understand
The guilt I've felt inside
Eats me alive
It eats me alive!

Sometimes the worst faults are the ones we make
Once you've made the mistake
Temptation blurs the things I wanna say
Myself got the best of me

You can be the judge
Juror, executioner
I deserve a sentence
To fuel all your vengeance
And it's full remorse for what I have done
If I'm locked away
Don't forget there's two sides to the story
If I'm condemned to a cell
To sit with my sins in hell
Then you better take notice
To the only notion
If I'm in here, she should be as well

Sometimes the worst faults are the ones we make
Once you've made the mistake
Temptation blurs the things I wanna say
Myself got the best of me
Can't you see
That it's not what I wanted
These streets are still haunted
You see, can't you see
That it's not what i wanted
Myself got the best of me

I could point a finger, but you'd cut it off
I could tell you outright it'd still be my fault
Can't you see, can't you see
That you mean more to me
When I say I'm sorry
I know that I'm wrong
I wanna say more
But I'll keep my mouth shut
Can't you see, can't you see
That you mean more to me
