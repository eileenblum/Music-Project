Yo hit em with the high and the low

quickly always escaping me
making it hard to breath
as you're moving through my mind
I need to talk to you
I need to know you
and words can not describe
you're paralyzing
it's hypnotizing
the way you move
and I can't get enough
so captivating
it drives me crazy
you're what I need
and I cant get enough

won't you take
me away to a better place
where my hearts
skips a beat
when I see your face
so take me, take me
and rearrange me
got me feeling high and low
so won't you take me, take me
and rearrange me
got me feeling high and low
so take me away

You're finally staring at me
your eyes on mine
time is standing still
for you and I

[Tyler Carter:]
You're paralyzing
and hypnotizing
The sight of you
I can't get enough
oh, baby I'm thinking of you
and I know I got you thinking of me too
but I'm all choked up
so I guess it's safe to say I'm blue
take me away to a better place

Where my heart skips a beat
when I see your face
so take me, take me
and rearrange me
got me feeling high and low
so won't you take me, take me
and rearrange me
got me feeling high and low
so take me away
take me away

Yo hit em with the high and the low
