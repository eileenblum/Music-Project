Array of fortunate life
But could you live through the fight
No you couldn't...
All the years of sheltered emotion
All these years I've seen no devotion

From you I could I offer honesty
If everyday offered something real

Decay of fortune and might
But would you stand up and fight
No you wouldn't
All these years without any notion
All the years I've seen no devotion from you

[Chorus]
