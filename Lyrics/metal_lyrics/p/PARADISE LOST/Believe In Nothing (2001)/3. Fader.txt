It's in my heart; it's in your soul,
You choose to judge,
Is that your role?
Don't analyse or complicate,
You'll critisise, you can't relate...

And now you want some understanding.
What's my point of view?

[Chorus:]
Then I'll just fade away
When I hear all your lies I choke
Then I'll just fade away
Suffering from the times you spoke I fade

Regarding more? just seems much less.
So cynical you must confess.
I'm dying here, completely blind
Your will to live - just dampens mine,

And now you want some understanding...
What's my point of view?

[Chorus]
