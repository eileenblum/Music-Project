Murder more or less
The anger rages
Blame your loneliness
Blame your situation

The essence is how
Much pleasure allowed
Solution is stealing

The times that you try
So many must die
Their loss so appealing

Murder more or less
The sense engages
Blame unwillingness
Blame your complications

The essence is how
Much pleasure allowed
Solution is stealing
Times that you try
So many must die
Their loss appealing

Is it too much to say?
Never again, never again

Is it too much to say?
Never again, never again
