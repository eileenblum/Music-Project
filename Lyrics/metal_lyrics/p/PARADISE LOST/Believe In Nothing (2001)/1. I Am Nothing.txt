Aware of some, aware of nothing more,
I have no faith I cannot settle scores,
You hope some day, I'll move out of the dark,
Your wishes fail 'cause I am nothing...

[Chorus:]
Slave to it all once again I fear,
Slave to it all are the ones most dear,
Thrilling you all with my tales not real,
You believe in them time after time...

On hopeless days I sit and justify,
A wholesome life, of which I'm so deprived,
I hope and pray, that I won't stay around,
Too long to stain, 'cause I am nothing...

[Chorus]

Hope someday?
I could be wrong...
