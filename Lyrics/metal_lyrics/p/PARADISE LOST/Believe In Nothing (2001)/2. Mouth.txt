Feel so low some days
And only I can taste
Resent security
Obscuring all I see

In my mind
In my mouth
In my soul
Only you provide these symptoms that I show

I could go out in style
Go back from where I came
But luck sees to us all
And rarely plays the game

We've seen it all through many years of lonesome hell
Back to a place where we all terminate
