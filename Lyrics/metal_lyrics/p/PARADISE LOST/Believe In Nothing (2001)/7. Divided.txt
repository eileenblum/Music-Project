This your only grace
The art of conversation
Regarding common sense
As merely an infliction

Divided we stand
Divided we stand

Maybe you're content
Relying on religion
You steal without consent
Just consummates my theory

Divided we stand
Divided we stand

Divided we'll stand
Regardless we'll fall
How subtle the words we've come to know
Divided we stand
Determined to fall
Just like this hollow world that sleeps inside of me...

Divided we stand
Divided we stand
