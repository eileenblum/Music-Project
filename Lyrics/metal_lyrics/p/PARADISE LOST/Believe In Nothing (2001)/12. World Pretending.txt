Washed out your simple world
But it seems to reappear
Without, your simple words
You cannot interfere

And now its so absurd what you're saying to me now
Your worlds pretending
You're saying to me now
Your worlds pretending
You're saying to me now
Your worlds pretending

And for your "so called" friends
They always seemed so dear
But when it all got worse
They seemed to disappear

And now its so absurd what you're saying to me now
Your worlds pretending
You're saying to me now
Your worlds pretending
You're saying to me now
Your worlds pretending
