Unleashed upon man
Their poisoning breains
An empty grasp - A threat to all those sane

The daggers poised
For shallow minds
Unheard laughs...
Disrupting all mankind

This rotting misery

The beggars are all gathered...
No others rule supreme...
Rotting misery

Clouded reality's
Brought before us
Their pointless lives
As all their faith is lost

Morbid existence
Of these poor souls
Now must die to exist no more
