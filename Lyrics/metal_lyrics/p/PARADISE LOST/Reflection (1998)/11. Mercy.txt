You live for times of solace
Within a sign there's a promise
Don't lose all faith cause you shake at night
It's in the art of the process

In another rhyme, beyond this place
The healing's fast enough...
Done a thousand times, a thousands ways
Until you're had enough

It's mercy you're asking for, Cheting life by taking more
It's mercy you're asking for, take my life or give me more...

The loss of prize possessions
To cure the mind's obsession
Could trade your soul for that normal life
Elite to all objections...

See beyond all tears, and broken years
Your senses giving up
Lost all confidence at your expense
Your courage swallowed up
