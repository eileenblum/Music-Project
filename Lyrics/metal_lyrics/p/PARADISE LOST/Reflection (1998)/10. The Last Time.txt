It's a struggle with a failures fronw
And it crashed in front of me
I see the clouds divide
Will you stay or try to leave

The time you're looking at through the door
And think to walk right through
I want to ignore
I only wish that it passes soon

I raise a sunken smile
As I serve the ones who served
What can I achieve
As you steal the air I breathe

it's a cruel misfortune
Forbidding us to see
When storied may collide
It's a sad state of mind

Hearts beating for the last time
Hearts beating it is a state of mind

Hearts beating for the last time
The peace you cannot find
