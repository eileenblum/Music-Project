Wretched will, host of pleasure surreal
Closed the room where the last is buried

Rise or fall at your master's request
You're unable to accept redemption

I don't know about a true belife here
With the 'Lost' it's the same as always

All I want is the same, a true belife

You can't wait to become a memory
With the 'Weak' it's the same as always

Stand confused lack of comprehension,
Re-Aroused by a thought of madness

And I know that the truth is always right
But it's time to search for lies
You're the one I try to save
But the blood spills from your veins

Call counting  time till the end
Death's wicked smile never fails
The curse is cast, and you're lost the past
Forevermore, a candle burns here no more

I don't know about a century of life
When the love of generations die

I can see no good in taking you own life
When any moment death calls...

All I want is the same, a true belife
