You get high, with your destructive instinct
You ger high, with your corrosive instinct
Where can I go, to escape your foul mind tricks
You're trying it more, but you will never break me

Cause you presume the winner is you, but that's not true, so say just a 
words to me

Unreal what your hates providing, say just words to me
Your talk is always contradiction, say just words to me
Won't feel warmth of friends around you, say just words to me
Is it rtue that is worth inside, so say just words to me

Your designs, all thhe worse from power craving
Your desires, only where there's fire burning
I'll show you the way, a pleasure that's for the talking
You're trying it more, you woun't get satisfaction

Cause you presume the winner is you, but that's not true, so say just the 
words to me
