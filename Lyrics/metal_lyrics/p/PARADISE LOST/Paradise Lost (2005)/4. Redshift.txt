There's something in the air that greets me
There's something in the air
I don't know where I belong, or where does it go from here

See my dreams; they're not like anyone's

There's something in your stare that greets me
There's something in your stare that tells me where I belong
And where it all goes from here

I don't know where I belong or where it all goes from here

See my dreams; they're not like anyone's, anyone's

There's something in the air that greets me
There's something in the air
I don't know where I went wrong or where does it go from here

See my dreams; they're not like anyone's, anyone's
