Too easy to explain...

Too easy to explain
What you'll never talk about
Too easy to explain
But you'll never see the light behind an open door

Some days already all over for me...
Some days already all over for me

Too easy to refrain
What you'll never talk about
Too easy to refrain
But you'll never see the light behind an open door

See the light behind an open door

Some days already all over for me
Some days already all over for me

On these nights we shine
Love ain't all the time we learn
I'd never want it so

Too easy to explain
But you'll never...

Some days already all over for me
Some days already all over for me

On these nights we shine
Love ain't all the time we learn
I'd never want it so

See the light behind an open door...
