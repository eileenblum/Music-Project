Got a right to show you how I feel
Got a right the truth I can't conceal
Gotta lie to show you some appeal
Gotta lie to cherish all that's real

Sun fades in some way
Enter tragedy
Some where there's some way
Like all you ever dreamed

Got a mind to show you how I feel
Criticise the smallest of ordeals
Gotta try to show you how to fear
Gotta try to make you disappear

Sun fades in some way
Enter tragedy
Some where there's some way
Like all you ever dreamed

Sun fading
Sun fading
