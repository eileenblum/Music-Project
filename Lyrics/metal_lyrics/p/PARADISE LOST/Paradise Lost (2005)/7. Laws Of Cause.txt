All this was the cause
All this was because you rose
All that's moved across
Was meaningless you show

All this was towards
All this was towards your goal
All the laws of cause
Are meaningless you showed me

We account for cost
As we wander through the lows
Learn we live with loss
And feelings we don't show

All this was towards
All this was towards your goal
All the laws of cause
Are meaningless you showed me

Said you could
Believe you could
I'd wandered far astray
Forever yield the doorway to my pain

All this was towards
All this was towards your goal
All the laws of cause
Are meaningless you showed me
