They say spirit always stays
They're all the same
These days experience decays
They all became

They're all the same

Agonising together
Like you know me
You must know me
All the tears I've endeavoured
You must owe me
You must owe me

They say will it all away
They're all the same
These days certainty is pain
They all became

They're all the same

Agonising together
Like you know me
You must know me
All the tears I've endeavoured
You must owe me

Sympathising together
Like you know me
You must know me
Live a life of surrender
You must owe me
