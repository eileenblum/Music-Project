The end untold desire

Night reveals unearthly ways I felt
failing lives abruptive games I felt
Gripped to life, you must resign all pride
Saved from this and use your darker side

Is your trust in god abandoned now
Silently, we're doomed
Silently, we're doomed

The end untold desire

Rage of fear inside and not fear you
They show my faith expire the truth
Waiting for the darker side to greet me
Pale my face until you're bleeding for me
