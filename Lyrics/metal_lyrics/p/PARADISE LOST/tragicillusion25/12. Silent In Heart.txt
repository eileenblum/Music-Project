And all the time I've wasted searching, you pretend
You never realised how close we're to the end

I'm here like sunshine
I'm here just sometimes

I never dreamed of life so jaded through contempt
As all deception ceases progress through resent

I'm here like sunshine,
I'm here just sometimes,

Let all the hatred go, silent in heart.
