Centuries, born to break my weary soul
Sanctioning, scorn to break my dearest foes
To rip the face off this
Reaching out I lost control

This soul in shame
All I can take
Who holds the blame
All that I've wasted

Sent to rest, scorn to break my weary soul
Sufferance, force to break my dearest goals
To rid disgrace from this
A loss of mind is lost control

To raise the gate, ever so elated
Erase the day ever so disdained

This soul in shame
All I can take
Who holds the blame
All that I've wasted

Descent awaits never you'll restrain this
Regret awaits forever your embrace
