[originally by Everything But The Girl]I step off the train
I'm walkin' down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
But now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run

I look up at your house
I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to be

I step off the train
I'm walkin' down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
But now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you
(Like the deserts miss the rain)
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
(Like the deserts miss the rain)
Like the deserts miss the rain
