Feel the will to try
Adapting all the time
Feel the wealth inside
For the last one...
For the last one...

Hear my last words
this my last regret

Kill the will to die
in a sense it all seemed right
Dreaming darkness lies
oh the last ones...
Freedom is dennied
for the last ones...

Hear my last words
this my last regret
