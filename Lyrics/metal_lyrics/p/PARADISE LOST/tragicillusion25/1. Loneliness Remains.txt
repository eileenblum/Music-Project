A Mother's shame
The Struggle For Intent
Another's blame
Life's troubled story ends

Show No Pretence
Youth has faded away
Show No Pretence
Beneath the mask that falls away

No Sudden faith
The Struggle For revenge
This sullen face
Only a loneliness remains

Show No Pretence
Youth has faded away
Show No Pretence
Beneath the mask that falls away

The past is calling
Free from dreams that show surrender
The last is falling
Flee from dreams that don't compare
Stalking the millions
A face unseen that won't repair
Stalling the millions
Embrace the dreams that show despair

Show no pretence
Beneath the mask that falls away
The past is calling
Free from dreams that show surrender
The last is falling
Flee from dreams that don't compare
Stalking the millions
A face unseen that won't repair
Stalling the millions
Embrace the dreams that show despair
