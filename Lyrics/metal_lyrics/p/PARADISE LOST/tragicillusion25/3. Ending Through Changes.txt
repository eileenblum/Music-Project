It's the same again. The truth is not too plain
No matter where you start
It's the same again. Refusal not to blame
For anything you are
An insane attempt a dire loser's discontent
Like arrows in the dark
Ending through changes everything changes
In the shade again, a truce too much to take
Endeavour night &amp; day
It's the same again, a truth's too much to take.
Innocent, no matter what they say
All the blame again the truth is not too plain
What matters falls apart impart
Ending through changes, everything changes
In the shade again, a truce too much to take
Endeavour night &amp; day
So ashamed again, until my dying day
