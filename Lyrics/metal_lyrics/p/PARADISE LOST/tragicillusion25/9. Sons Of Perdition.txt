And all I ever want is never
And though I struggle with the pain
And all I ever want is severed
So that you...
So you must respect the shamed

Saviour above never came

Regarding all the pain a pleasure
And though the struggle seems inane
There is no worth in your endeavour
So that you...
So you must accept the rage

Saviour above never came

And I'm saddened the way you go
Sad in the way, beneath.
