It's all I want
Clear my mistakes
All adhere to the first disgrace
Caress all with this agony

In dreams I have tried
Don't look back on disaster
Ask your questions in time

Despite the hate are you afraid
All consumed by a surging grace

I've buried all with this agony tears I have cried

Don't look back on disaster
Is there a place and a time

When all your dreams that just break apart you fall apart it seems
Another ending you'd make the start embrace the heart be free

Hail to the bitterness
