[Holmes/Mackintosh]

I don't owe anything 
I don't owe anyone 
Shoot pride for all its worth 
I don't belong 

In a situation now 
That I could not repair 
I assert myself to sleep 
Show others that I've cared 
How cold is this poor life 
Lay ashes at my grave 

If it takes me away from you 
A subtle gesture 

I don't know anyone (cherish my religion) 
I don't know anyone (faith is only fiction) 
I don't know anyone (cherish my religion) 
I don't know anyone (faith is only fiction) 

This is erased I promise not a trace 
This is erased I promise no delay not a trace
