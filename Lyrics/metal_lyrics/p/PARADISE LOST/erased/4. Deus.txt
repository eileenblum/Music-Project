[Holmes/Mackintosh]

Like I am, in awe who makes
Like I am, in awe who saves?

Life's golden themes unmade
Life's golden dreams where I live for the hour
And sentimental rage

And all these things are made
Will all these things remain?

Blind hours we all embrace
Blind hours were all replaced
Life's golden years abstained
Life's golden years where
I lived for a passion
The melancholic days

And all these things are made
Will all these things remain?
