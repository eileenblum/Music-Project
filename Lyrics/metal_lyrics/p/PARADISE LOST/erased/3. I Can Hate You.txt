[Holmes/Mackintosh]

There's no provocation
There's no sense of fear
There's no adaptation
There's no sorrow

But, maybe when you're dead I can hate you
Maybe when you're dead I can hate you

Without limitations
Without bitter years
Without annihilation
There's no result

But, maybe when you're dead I can hate you
Maybe when you're dead I can hate you

There's no provocation
There's no sense in tears
There's no litigation
There's no product

But, maybe when you're dead I can hate you
Maybe when you're dead I can hate you
