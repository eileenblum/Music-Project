I need time I know
I need time I know
but it's too late
your time I don't need
I've the mission for you
can you see it through
resist what I say
accept what I do...

you'll see
mourning the loss is just pain to one self

numbered days are few
the lies promised to you
are a good way
of keeping it all
collapsed is our bond
I pretend to respond
no love for the lost...
no love for the lost...

you'll see
mourning the loss is just pain to one self
