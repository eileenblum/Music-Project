Wish it all away; it's all the same to you
Living eternally is all you wish to do

And if I said that you'll come down
You'll remain...
And if I said you must come down
You'll remain...

Villain or a saint its all a game to me
Laughing in the face of it all
I swear you've always been

And if I said that you'll come down
You'll remain....
And if I said you must come down
You'll remain....

And if I said that you seem lonely again
Cause your speaking too much, but your efforts in vein
And I think that you'll lose your mind someday
Why don't you leave this alone?
Why don't you leave this alone?

Wish it all away; it's all the same to you
Laughing eternally is all you seem to do

And if I said that you'll come down
You'll remain....
And if I said you must come down
You'll remain....
