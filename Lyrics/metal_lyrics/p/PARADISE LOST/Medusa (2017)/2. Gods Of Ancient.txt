As Gods creations fail through honesty
One last salvation returns again decayed

Scorn through desperation
Searing devastation

The strong collapsing in my wake
Heed the Gods of ancient begin their reign
The Gods of ancient begin their reign

Evolved damnation, pains insanity
Our lost salvation we spurn, condemn, we slay

Scorn through deprivation
Free the condemnation

The strong collapsing in my wake
Heed the Gods of ancient begin their reign
The Gods of ancient begin their reign

Crawling through fire

Fear the others, fear the others that rise
Fear among us, until the end you're despised

Learning the order to kill, heeding the stars constellations
Feeding on blood that is spilled
Fearing the stars as we're ordered to rise

Fear the others, fear the others that rise
Fear among us, until the end you're despised

The strong, collapsing in my wake
Heed the Gods of ancient begin their reign
The strong, collapsing in my wake
Heed the Gods of ancient begin their reign
