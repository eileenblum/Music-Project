With God, in chaos, with sorrow to tame us
Reach for the symbol of your world
The shroud, of pathos, each symptom inflames us
Preaching the symbol of the scourge

To a fearless sky
Gold until death, theory lies in our distress
To a fearless sky
Gold until death, bleary eyes from our regrets
To a fearless sky

We're fraught with danger, defiance our saviour
Redeeming principles on mass
This shrine impales us, each traitor regales us
Preaching a sentimental dirge

To a fearless sky
Gold until death, endearing die from all regrets
To a fearless sky
Gold until death, theory lies in our distress
To the fearless sky

With God, in chaos, will sorrow long to tame us?
Reach for the symbol of your world

We hail true belief as life's unveiled!
To receive repentance, as the choir laments us

We'll slay non-believers night and day
To receive the sentence with a fire of vengeance

(Crawling hypocrisy will fade away)
We rise again
(The dawning of honesty will fade away)
We ride against the frail
(Crawling hypocrisy will fade away)
We rise again
(The dawning of honesty will fade away)
We ride against the frail

Life's contempt, a life of trial to unrest, vilified
I resent, morbid times so oppressed, soul divine
Lies torment, as I try to confess to a fearless sky

With God, in chaos, with sorrow to tame us
Reach for the symbol of your world
The shroud, of pathos, each symptom inflames us
Preaching the symbol of the scourge

To a fearless sky
Gold until death, theory lies in our distress
To a fearless sky
