Born in duress
Timeless the snare
Reading the speeches of ancient
Blood on their hands

Speaking the words of long dead
Armistice is made
Sing from the gallows in shame
Honour is stained

Born into life
Glory in death
Upon the gallows you swing
Timeless the end

Born into life
Glory in death
Upon the gallows you swing
A timeless lament

They fear us, the fallen fear our pride
Come fear us, the dead are destined to remind
