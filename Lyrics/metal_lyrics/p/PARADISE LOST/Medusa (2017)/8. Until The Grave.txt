A million die
Crowded tombs where once we laid
The deadest eyes
Still engaged, as one afraid

The thrall obey
Return the ashes the widow enraged
The walls enslaved
Return the ending, a veil of dismay

The night follows day
Save your prayers, divided 'til the grave
(Divided 'til the grave)

The dreaded sky
Abandoned rooms where one remains
A shredded cry
Blood ingrained where once, we prayed

The walls enslaved
Return the ashes the widow enraged
The thrall obey
Return the ending, a veil of decay

The night follows day
Save your prayers, divided 'til the grave
(Divided 'til the grave)

Control, obey
Return the ashes the widow enraged
The walls enslaved
Return the ending, a veil of dismay

The night follows day
Save your prayers, divided 'til the grave
(Divided 'til the grave)

Divided 'til the grave
