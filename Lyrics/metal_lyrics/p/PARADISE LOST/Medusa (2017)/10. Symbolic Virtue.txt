I cannot sleep through endless hours
I cannot breathe the thoughts devour
I cannot weep through lost desire
An image burns into the fire

We're hollowed, through sorrow
We follow, yearn tomorrow
To death's symbolic virtue

We're hollowed, through sorrow

We follow down that long road
To death's symbolic virtue

With fingers clenched the dread empowers
In our lament, the menace towers
Into fragments the bridge has fallen
Gods orders breached, a will is calling

We're hollowed, through sorrow
We follow yearn tomorrow
To death's symbolic virtue

We're hollowed, through sorrow

We follow down that long road
To death's symbolic virtue
(To death's symbolic virtue)

We're hollowed, through sorrow
We follow yearn tomorrow
To death's symbolic virtue

We're hollowed, through sorrow

We follow down that long road
To death's symbolic virtue
