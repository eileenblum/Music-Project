Fearless ones, wash away the years
Fearless ones, wash away the pain, the tears
Canât unload the lows
In the shadow of a dying light
Canât unload the lows
In the fear of a dying light

Dread through centuries shrines
A cold descent of our minds
In abject misery, aligning stars fall
Dread through the centuries shrines

A coldness spreading through time
In abject misery, enduring scars form

Healing sun shelter from release

Grieving, none, crushing waves of long deceit

Canât unload the lows
In the shadow of a dying light
Canât unload the lows
In the fear of a dying light

Dread through centuries shrines
A slow descent of our lives
In abject misery, aligning stars fall
Dread through the centuries shrines
A coldness spreading through time
In abject misery, enduring scars form
(Enduring scars form)

Dread through centuries shrines
A cold descent of our lives
In abject misery, aligning stars fall
Dread through the centuries shrines

A coldness spreading through time
In abject misery, enduring scars form

In abject misery, enduring scars form
In abject misery, enduring scars form
