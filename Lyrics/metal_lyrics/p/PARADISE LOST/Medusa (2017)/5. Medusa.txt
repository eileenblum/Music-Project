Agony, inside desire that yearns no longer
Memories, burning the fire that made you stronger

The life that blinded me divided me forever bleeds
Divisive blinded deed the spineless we can never reach

Heresy, into a wilderness they wander
Tragedy, a perished heart that aches you conquered

The life that I must lead the heartless one that never sleeps
Endeavour to receive the strong, the brave, the empathy

Pretenders to the throne
Their willing turns to stone

This life â the last, the principle has lapsed
This life â the last, a yearning to relapse

This life â the last, the principle has passed
This life â the last, a yearning to relapse

Pretenders to the throne
Their willing turns to stone

This life â the last, the principle has lapsed
This life â the last, a yearning to relapse

This life â the last, the principle has passed
This life â the last, a yearning to relapse
