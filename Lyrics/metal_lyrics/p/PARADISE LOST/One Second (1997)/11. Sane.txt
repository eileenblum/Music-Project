Seasons of sun won't suffice,
But for you my guarding light, I'd walk around this earth.
Though the streets are paved with gold I'd collect it to be sold,
I'm bringing this on myself

But I feel for you,
Will you show you're sane.

In your mouth a loaded gun,
Pull the trigger have you won
Let's see how you can do, it's the darker days you dread,
All the hurtful things I said, it seems I'm nothing,

But I feel for you,
Will you show you're sane.
