I could not care less for oh, so many things tales
Of your distress and what tomorrow brings
Alluring you on sight I'd harbour my delight.
You could not care for what tune sorrow sings.

In this battle of ages
Abreath of fire would light your pilot.
Are you soul courageous?
A breath of life would make
You maybe see... you bring me to the ground
You bring me to the ground

Victory's in vain unless one knows the score
Inner peace reclines, in a place the bitter scorn
Spirit maketh man always at hand
But spirit fails to save the ones worth waiting for.
