I find when I'm all alone that I feel so ashamed, cause all my pride is gone
Say what you never can resist
Say what you never would believe
Give what you never want to show.
Give what you never would receive.
A time when I'm all alone &amp; I'm breathing afraid, cause all my pride is gone
Elate the tears I create, how completely inane, cause all my pride is gone.

Collapse at my sorry stance but I need to surpass cause...
My only thrill alone in my own hell
