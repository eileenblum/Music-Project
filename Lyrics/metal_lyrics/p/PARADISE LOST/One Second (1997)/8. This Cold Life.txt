I can take one day to achieve my goal, then it starts again.
In this circumstance that I call my own dreams just don't deliver.
I never needed foes forever feeling low cause they breake me down cannot fake
this frown.
I never took offence I never swore in advance but I'll breake you down with my
poison mouth again.

I cannot deny bittersweet recline to a sole religion
It's a certain way that I'm feeling host to a new deception...
