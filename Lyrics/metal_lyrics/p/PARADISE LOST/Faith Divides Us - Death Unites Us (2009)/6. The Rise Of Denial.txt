Ascending from your fallen past
Life it's the same
Attending to a loneliness
For you, never

Through channels of uncertainty
A rise of denial
This sadness is positioning
As fortunes snares lay me down

In a dream despite
The air we breathe, serenity

Grip the dead hands of the last
Detritus invades
Indefinite the consequence
For you endeavour to
Aggravate uncertainty
A rise of denial
This passion wont forgive
And ill fortune tears you down

All that's been ignites
Suppressing me, serenity
