Nature
I've never shown so much redemption
I've never shown

Crawl through the mist to the masses
Born through sadness
Endeavoured far too long with this
I'm past this now

Your reach is far too long

Drawn to the freedom of action
Sworn compassion
Been severed far too long from this
I'm past this now

Failure,
I've never shown so much intention
I've never known

Scorn a resist that surpasses
Fortunes absence
Been severed far too long from this
It's fractured now

And all I've got is frailty to release
time waits for no one

Your show won't save me from the past
Dissolved dreaming it could last
