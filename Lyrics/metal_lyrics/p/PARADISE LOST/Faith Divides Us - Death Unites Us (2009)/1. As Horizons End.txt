To remain pessimistic found, in this hour of distress
Till decayed, derelict down
In this shower of pretence

Desire profane
You never see again

As horizons end
Ever to descend
As horizons end
Ever to descend

You retain a desolated frown
In this hour of distress
You invade the decadent crowd
In a shadow of pretence

Desire profane
You never see again
The light of day it seems to be enslaved
