We spend a lifetime
In death we trade
Until it's over manipulate the ones who stay

Guarded and secret
Stalking a world in which I'm new
Sorely deceitful
In all that is so abused

For the universal dream, born to understand
For the universal need, born to understand

Repenting lifestyles
In death we train
Until it's over
Eliminate the ones who stay

Guarded and secret
Another world in which I grew
Sorely deceitful
In all that is so abused

For the universal dream, born to understand
For the universal need, born to understand

Manipulate the ones who say
Save me
Manipulate the ones who stay
Incriminate me
