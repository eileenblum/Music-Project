I'm, I'm in a picture with you
You just seem to know
I am a liar, I am a fake
In truth
You don't need to know

I turn at the laughter
As you proceed to show
I am a dead man, I'm a mistake
It's true
Do I need to know?

In all I've shown
Cross me again, all hope defeated again

Hold on we all strive
We ascend from a world we all try
