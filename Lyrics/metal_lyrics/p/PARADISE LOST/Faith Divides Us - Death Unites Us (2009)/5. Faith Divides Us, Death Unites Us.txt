Refrain from the way we were
Slain the invincible
Changed are the the ways of man
Fortitude to face the path

[Chorus:]
Vanquish the pain don't want to see it fail
Faith divides us death unites us
Vanquish the pain don't want to seek despair
Faith divides us death unites us

Tears for a hopeless case
Outside is still so vague
Frayed the landscapes of old
Cleared the indelible

[Chorus]

Cannot sleep through darkened skies
Cannot dream until it's over
Cannot sleep through darkened skies
Cannot dream until it's over

[Chorus]
