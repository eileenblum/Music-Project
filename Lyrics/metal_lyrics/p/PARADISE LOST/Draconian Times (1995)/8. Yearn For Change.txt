Approaching a silence, a blur of subsidence

Time may heal all troubles, is that what I've found?
Joy entices all, until death's lonely shroud
But I know it's forever......

Praying for a change

Our lives leading onwards, the essence is stronger

Memories of life drifting further away I must doubt that where
There's a will there's a way......
But I know, it's forever

Life is all the pain we endeavour
