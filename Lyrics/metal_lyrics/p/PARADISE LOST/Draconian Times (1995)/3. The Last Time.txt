It's a struggle with a failure's frown
And it crashes in front of me
I see the clouds divide
Will you stay or try to leave?

The time you're looking at the door
And you're thinking to walk right through
I want to ignore
I only wish that it passes soon

Heart's beating [6x]

I raise a sunken smile
As I serve the ones who served
What can I achieve
As you steal the air I breathe?

It's a cruel misfortune
Forbidding us to see
When stories may collide
It's a saddened state of mind

Heart's beating [6x]
For the last time

Heart's beating for the last time
Heart's beating it's still a state of mind
Heart's beating
Heart's beating for the last time
Heart's beating
The peace you cannot find
