Opaque the dissident establishment
That we all suffer
Refill the porous shell with words that mean so many things

Words mean so many things

The feeling can't avoid you

Stoking the fires of absence
Loss and anguish long departed
Adjust to changes re-arranging, burns in many ways

Pain burns in many ways

The feeling can't avoid you
