Lost faith in others
Lost faith in all

Fading trust evermore
Ashamed of what we endure

Into the grave, the heartless
Consoled in darkness
A lack of faith

No one can save you now
Thorns you wear as a shroud

Born to save, the night has fallen
Born to save, just save us from the past

No-one can save you now
Fortune tears as you drown

Sworn disdain, the knife has fallen
Sworn to save, the victims of the past

The others
The guiding flame

Lost faith in others

Lost faith in all

Fading trust evermore
Ashamed of what we endure
Into a veil of darkness
Console the heartless
A lack of faith

Born to save the night has fallen
Born to save just save us from the past

No-one can save you now
Thorns you wear as a shroud all victims of the past
