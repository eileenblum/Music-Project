Neglect afraid to say
Repentance awaits
Rejected jaded decayed
A vengeance awaits

Behold the darkness true the light
The flame upon us soon ignites
The depth of solemn ones disdain
A yearning dread forever slaves

Punishment through Time

Unfold the righteous soon ordained
Inside a tomb of souls disgraced
The depths of solemn tears disdain
Returning death into the grey

Punishment through Time

You perceive your life &amp; goals depressed
You conceal a crisis, souls repressed

Reaching out untied for sudden death

Neglect afraid to say
Repentance awaits
Rejected jaded decayed
A vengeance awaits
