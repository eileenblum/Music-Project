No hope in sight
daylight before them dies
enshrined the horrified
no hope in sight

Have I prayed
as a slave of lasting cry's
to obey
to sedate as humour dies

Cold embrace
is the saviour in disguise
through old age
only danger never dies
never dies

It's a battle
as the years start to fade
it's a battle
as the years start to fade

No hope in sight
a light before us dies
alligned the horrified
no hope in sight

You'll face your fears
through faded years
it's a battle
as the years start to fade
it's a battle 
as the years start to fade

No hope in sight
daylight before them dies
enshrined the horrified
no hope in sight
