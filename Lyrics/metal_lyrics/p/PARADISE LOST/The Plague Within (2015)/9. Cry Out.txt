Too ashamed to lie and so betray
Too afraid denials slow intake

Cry out as you flee disaster

Doomed a failure, life is sold and played
Universals spineless cause is frayed

Cry out as you flee disaster

A spear impaled in settled dust
Tortured, drained, the fire crushed
Lost in vein no others trust
Reaching the death of innocence
You cry out as sinners against the world
You the break the chain you feed reaction
Too ashamed you lie and so betray
Too afraid denials slow intake

Cry out as you flee disaster

You cry out as sinners against the world
You the break the chain you feed reaction
