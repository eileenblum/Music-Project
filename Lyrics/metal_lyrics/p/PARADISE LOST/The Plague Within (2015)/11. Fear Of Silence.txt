In this nightmare that you and I know best
You and all the rest

In this nightmare that you and I confess
You and I regret

The face in the dark cloud haunts me
The safety in silence taunts me

All that I share, indifference at best
You damaged all intent

For all the sins Iâve done, I still belong
