Fortunes jaws embrace
At failures loss throughout the days

Deploring scorn we face
My pain is loss through disarray

Return To the sun

Face to look inside my mind
A place youâve never been
Face to look inside my mind
A place youâve never dreamed

Vermilion the sands
The gallant slain

Your fallen Godâs afraid
Eternal dying night &amp; day

All folded laws are frayed
A sullen tragic masquerade

Return to the sun

Face to look inside my mind
A place youâve never been
Face to look inside my mind
A place youâve never dreamed

Return to the sun
