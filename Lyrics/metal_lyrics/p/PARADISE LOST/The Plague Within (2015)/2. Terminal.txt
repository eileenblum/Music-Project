A frail form surrounds
Infection, sorrow, screams aloud
Trade your soul connect to fear
Feeding death, tormented downed

Forget the past, are you still believing tonightâs denial dominates the dreaming

A veiled mournerâs frown
Tomorrows dreams confound
Trade the souls you hold most dear

Into darkness youâre the last

Forget the past, are you still believing
Tonightâs denial dominates the dreaming

I can hope as silence and torture grows
The violence we now condemn infests our inner souls

Regret the past, are you still believing, tonightâs denial dominates the dreaming

I can hope as silence and torture grows

A frail form surrounds
Infection, sorrow, screams aloud
Trade your soul connect to fear
Feeding death, tormented downed
