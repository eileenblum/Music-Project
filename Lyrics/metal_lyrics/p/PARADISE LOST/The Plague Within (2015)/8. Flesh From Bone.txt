My reality, flawed you oppress me
Immortality whored by God as the claws are left in me

My insanity, fallen dignity
Whored by God as weâre drenched in slavery

Peeling skin flesh from bone
Dealing sin, none shall roam

See the righteous fall at the rise of the damned, denied
See others crawl in the hour demand and fight

Unto deadly sin I fall
Praise to deadly sin!

My reality, flawed you oppress me
Immortality, whored by God as the claws are left in me

Peeling skin flesh from bone
Dealing sin, none shall roam

See the righteous fall as the rise of the damned, denied.
See others crawl to the towers of rancid spite

To the deadly king I fall
To the deadly king!
