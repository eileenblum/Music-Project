The darkest past
Forever could last
Beneath the sanctity I pray
For honestyâs sake

Never sail the lie
When its scorn is brought to life
Forever sacrifice the flame

The die is cast
The circle one less
Through brief insanity I pray
For honestyâs sake

Never say deny
When its scorn is brought to life
Forever Sacrifice the flame

So heartless so
Careless dreams torment the soul

So dark the souls
Spare us dreams torment the soul
