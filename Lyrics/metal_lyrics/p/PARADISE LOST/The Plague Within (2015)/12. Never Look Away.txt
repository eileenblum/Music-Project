Domination reigns
Born again life ascends
The sullen see the shame

Termination fails
Sworn intent I repent
As deprivation rains

Devastations rage
Torn again, I resent
This sudden seal of fate

Acquisitions fail
I repent my descent
In sullen grief and shame

Life is to compare
Suffering at the hands of darkness
All sink to despair
Suffering at the hands of darkness

Anticipation it feeds
A son of faith to offer life
Aggravation it feeds
To honour pain, dishonour life

Domination reigns
Born again life ascends
The sullen see the shame

Afraid to look around
High as death surrounds
Afraid look away

Afraid of looking down
Never look away
