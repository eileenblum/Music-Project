Lies divided me I wonder
Cries enlighten me I wonder
Light has guided me I'm stronger
To escape to where dearly intended dwell
Never seen the light, I don't know where to escape
From that fear of impending hell
Now I've seen the light, my soul laid bare
To forsake that fear of impending hell
Life denying needs my hunger
Paralysing dreams I wander
Life has binded me I'm stronger
To escape from the tears of a last farewell
The party's over you never could believe
Now it's over you never would believe
