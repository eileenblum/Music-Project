So determined to enslave
A pain we long disdained
Seem determined to embrace
We are all the same
So conceal the night &amp; day
Afraid of what's portrayed
Breathing deprivations wake
We're all inane
Until the dawn lifts
Only stare into the darkness
The days will blur
The darkest days, days will seem so clear
Announce your turn
Today we turn to the deceased
So determined to explain
Those tortured steps invade
Your sole integrity betrayed
We're all the same
Until the dawn lifts
Only stare into the Darkness
