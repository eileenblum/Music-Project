It's worth fighting for
Failing now I wonder, turn the other way
Fading down to under
Don't let me dream at all, don't let me sleep
Don't let me dream at all, there's something that's a part of me
Must never be revealed, a rushing that just starts in me
It's never to be seen
It's worth fighting for
Fading down to under, turn the other way
Afraid and down I wander, damned &amp; disobeyed
There's something that just starts in me,
It never can redeem
There's something that's regarding me, you never would believe
