In amidst the madness
That only tears into myself
The mist of sadness
It turns into my hell

Burns into the frail
All this speak of death

My honesty in death
Modesty until the end
Honesty in death

In amidst the anguish
My only prayers are to myself
Resistance crashes
As clemency compels

Turning not to face
Only speak of death

My honesty in death
Honesty adorns the end
Modesty's intent

My honesty in death
Modesty until the end
Honesty in death

My honesty in death
Honesty adorns the end
Modesty's intent
