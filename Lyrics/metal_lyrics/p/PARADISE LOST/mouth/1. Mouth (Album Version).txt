FEEL SO LOW SOME DAYS
AND ONLY I CAN TASTE
RESENT SECURITY
OBSCURING ALL I SEE

IN MY MIND
IN MY MOUTH
IN MY SOUL
ONLY YOU PROVIDE THESE SYMPTOMS THAT I SHOW

I COULD GO OUT IN STYLE
GO BACK FROM WHERE I CAME
BUT LUCK SEES TO US ALL
AND RARELY PLAYS THE GAME

WE'VE SEEN IT ALL THROUGH MANY YEARS OF LONESOME HELL
BACK TO A PLACE WHERE WE ALL TERMINATE
