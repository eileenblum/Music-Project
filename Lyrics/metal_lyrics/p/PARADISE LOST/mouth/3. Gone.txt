ACCEPT THIS BITTER PAIN
ACCEPT THIS BITTER PAIN
THERE'S TOO MANY SEASONS HAVE CHANGED
THERE'S TOO MANY REASONS TO CHANGE

AND WHEN DID YOU DECIDE 
WHEN ID GONE?
AND WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO BREAKDOWN
WHEN ID GONE?

YOUR WRATH HAS BEING UNCHAINED
YOUR WRATH HAS BEING UNCHAINED

THERE'S TOO MANY FEELING ESTRANGED
THERE'S TOO MANY LEAVING THE STAGE

AND WHEN DID YOU DECIDE 
WHEN ID GONE?
AND WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO BREAKDOWN
WHEN ID GONE?
