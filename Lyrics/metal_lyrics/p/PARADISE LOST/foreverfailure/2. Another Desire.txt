leaving as the wind blows, i recall, i needed control
pain leaves harsh remains, throughout the day.
leaving as our lives close, i recall, i needed control 
learning from the sorrow, i confess, i need some control
laughter heals the spirt for a while
life may seem of interest, for a while

learning from the sorrow
