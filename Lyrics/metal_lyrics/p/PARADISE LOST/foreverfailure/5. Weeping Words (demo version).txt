Fear this more (the more) than the hands of man's (disgrace)
It crushes forth (resenting) conquest its plan

Don't look back, will I ever see you face again?

The domination (is in all) Imagination (space)
Caress endlessly (until we) inflame the soul...

Fading to return what's borrowed, devoting rights to me
I see a summer of winters merging gracefully

Don't look back, will we ever see you face again
Don't look back, will I hear the weeping words again
