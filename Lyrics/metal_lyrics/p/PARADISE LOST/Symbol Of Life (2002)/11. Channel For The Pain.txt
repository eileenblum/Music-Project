I live all alone, I wonder why?
I live all alone, I wonder why?

See me shaking never making
All my life and there is no other way
'til I'm old enough and hit the ground,

Never choose, because I'm here just to lose,
Besides a win would just release,
And just maybe solve my minor problems

Don't wanna seek, I won't make a demand,
Cause I'm taking all the things
That prevent me from knowing the truth
Don't wanna seek, I won't make a demand,
Cause although my mind is breaking
My existence makes a channel for the pain

I live all alone, I wonder why?
I live all alone, I wonder why?

See me taking never giving all my life
And there is no other way
Till I'm old enough and hit the ground
I only lose cause I never did choose and all the loneliness
That's there is just the core of all my problems

Don't wanna seek, I won't make a demand,
Cause I'm taking all the things
That prevent me from knowing the truth
Don't wanna seek, I won't make a demand,
Because although my mind is breaking
My existence makes a channel for the pain

I live all alone, I wonder why?
I live all alone, I wonder why?
