i'm sent for elimination
to where i cannot know, but i'm lost without a chance in hell
and i'm lost with doubts i can avoid this come feel the fire burn i'll slowly drift away
a victim of the future my mind and soul decayed

isolate

i'm sent for eradication
by whom i cannot know, but i'm lost without a chance in hell
i'm the last one out i can't avoid this

exposed to fire but i'll burn another way
a victim of the future i embrace the tourniquet

isolate

lead us all to pastures green
to search and learn
from ones i cannot be

lead us all to harmony
to search and learn
the one i cannot be
