i don't owe anything
i don't owe anyone
shoot pride for all its worth
i don't belong

in a situation now
that i could not repair
i assert myself to sleep
show others that i've cared
how cold is this poor life
lay ashes at my grave

if it takes me away from you
a subtle gesture

i don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
i don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)
i don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
i don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)

this is erased i promise not a trace
this is erased i promise no delay not a trace
