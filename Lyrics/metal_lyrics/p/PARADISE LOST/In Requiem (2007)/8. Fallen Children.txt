As creation reaches high,
Generations we deny,

Never again believe me...

Faded questioning remorse
Eases suffering and loss

Never again believe me...

We alone, the fallen children...

Contemplating this resent
Understanding this contempt
Sorry to say it's easy

Frail the essence of denial
I return to face this trial
Never again believe me...

We alone, the fallen children...

Can't save me like the others tried
Don't fail me as the others die

We alone, the fallen children...

Can't save me, like the others tried
Don't fail me, as the others die
