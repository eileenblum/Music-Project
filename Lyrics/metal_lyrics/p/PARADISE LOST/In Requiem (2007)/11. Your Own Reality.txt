All that's lost never found, remains of all this...
Never crossed are the ones that see
Taken to the ground, because you're honest
Stripped and bound for your honesty

It's in your heart, it's in your soul

Never disguise all the tears that I've cried

I took a trip inside I'm weary,
Lay injustice on your head

It's in your heart, it's in my soul in your own reality
It's in my heart it's in your soul...

You believe that control has freed
Never disguise all the tears that are cried

We all betray despite the theories
But I'm not conscious of the things I did

It's in your heart, it's in my soul, in your own reality
It's in my heart it's in your soul...

You believe that control has freed
Never disguise all the tears that are cried
