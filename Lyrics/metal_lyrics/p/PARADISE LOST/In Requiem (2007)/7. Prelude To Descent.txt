Set me down, Oh set me down
On hallowed ground again
Wear me down in prayer confounded
Shadow my torment

It's dead it's over all too slow
Can't you see youâre my worst enemy?
It's over, overthrown
All I see is just faithless decree

Set me down, Oh lay me down
On ravaged ground again
Lay me down, embrace me now,
My prelude to descent

We never run the same way...
We never run the same...
