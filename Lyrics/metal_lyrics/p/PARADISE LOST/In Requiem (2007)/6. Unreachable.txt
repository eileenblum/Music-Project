More than this
A certain divide ask yourself why,
More than this
Turn back in time wondering why

Then you'll see, tears won't wash this away
Memories of the years that started the pain

All of this
Thoughts that unite long been denied
All of this
Anger ignites a lasting goodbye

Then you'll see, tears won't wash this away
Memories of the years that started the pain

Can't you see tears won't wash out the rage?
Memories fallen years that started the hate
