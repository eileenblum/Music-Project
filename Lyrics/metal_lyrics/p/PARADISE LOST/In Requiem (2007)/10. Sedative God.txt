You belong, don't look back,
No excuses...
When you're down, face the crowd,
So illusive...

To be the same is always there for me
To feel constrained is always there for me

Can you see the light?
Can you question why?
I wonder how, eternally Iâm blind

When you're strong, have no doubts
So elusive...
When your thoughts face the shroud
Unobtrusive...

To be the same is always there for me
To feel constrained is always there for me

The seeds we never sow
Sedative god

Right way, there's a wrong way
And there's no way
