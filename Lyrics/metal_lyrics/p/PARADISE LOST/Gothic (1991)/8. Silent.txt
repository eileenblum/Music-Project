After all wars
We lie, as shelter falls
The world is but hell
A place darkened out by time
Submit to the fall

Live in peace for years
Turn back the hands of time

Light shines before
As lives are torn
Morals slow decline
We'll live in cold fear
Until we lay dead
Silent our pleas
Search for the end
