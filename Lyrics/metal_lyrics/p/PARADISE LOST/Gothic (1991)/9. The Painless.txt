Locked inside this peaceful tomb
Entwined on seas of endless bliss

The painless...
Strength is released
The horror passes through our eyes

Diversions cast upon our souls
The meek shall inherit our fears

Stray from this tranquil place
Guarded by all fear
Submit now to this curse
In out plight for existence
Reach the sky not falling down
Sunlight shines in heaven
Stray from this tranquil place
