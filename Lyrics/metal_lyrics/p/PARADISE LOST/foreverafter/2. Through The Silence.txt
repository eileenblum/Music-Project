Drifting out of sight
Fade into the night
Drifting out of sight
Lure me from the light

These are the things that you can't receive
This and all things you cant achieve
Through the silence you'll be deceived
In this your hour of make believe

Tripping out excites
Lonely is my life

Hate is out of sight
Waiting to ignite

These are the things that you can't receive
This and all things you cant achieve
Through the silence you'll be deceived
In this your hour of make believe

We've got the things that you wanna see
We are the things that you wanna be
