You'll never know the pain that I fear
You'll never known the pain that I fear

You've never felt the shame
And so inside of me
You'll never know the pain

Sanctimonious you
You're who I really want to be
Sanctimonious you
You're who I really want to be

You never seem ashamed, of what I see
You've never been afraid, without me
You've never been afraid
You're who I want to be
You've never been afraid

Sanctimonious you
You're who I really want to be
Sanctimonious you
You're who I really want to be

Another day
I'm lifeless, ordinary
Another day
I'm lifeless, ordinary

You'll never know the pain that I fear
You'll never known the pain
