[Limited Edition Digipak Bonus Track]

How many times can I pass this by?
On and on regardless
How many times must I gratify?
On and on regardless
How many times must I have this trial?
On and on in darkness

It's the question of life
It's a quest for a sign
A side you'll never know
It's a question of life
It's a quest for a sign
A side you'll never know

How many times must I pacify
On and on regardless
How many times, how sullen the smile
All consuming sadness
Open your eyes for the last time
Find a way in darkness

It's the question of life
It's a quest for a sign
A side you'll never know
It's a question of life
It's a quest for a sign
A side you'll never know

How many times can I pass this by?
On and on regardless
How many times can I multiply?
On and on regardless

It's the question of life
It's a quest for a sign
A side you'll never know
It's a question of life
It's a quest for a sign
A side you'll never know
