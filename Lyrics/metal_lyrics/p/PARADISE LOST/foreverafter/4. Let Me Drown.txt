[Limited Edition Digipak Bonus Track]

You don't trust anything
Anything at all you know this
You won't love anything
Anything at all you know this

Can you save me?
Can you save me?

Let me drown
I'm in no order
Let me drown
I'm in no order

True you're not anyone that almost knows
So shrewd it's almost staggering

Can you save me?
Can you save me?

Let me drown
I'm in no order
Let me drown
I'm in no order

You don't trust anything
Anything at all you know this
You won't love anything
Anything at all you know this
