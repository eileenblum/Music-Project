[1] Claws of death, grips my life
Empty my mind and my knowledge is deceased
Mindless and dumb, instinct gone.

[2] Running in circles
Not knowing where my fate lies...

[3] Blinding, running through the eternal maze
Surrounded by people the same
Not knowing this place as the darkness falls above...
Will we ever see the sun deteriorate away?

[4] Feelings disappear
Your eyes stare blank
Another world to greet
Life now ends......

[Repeat verses 2 + 3]
