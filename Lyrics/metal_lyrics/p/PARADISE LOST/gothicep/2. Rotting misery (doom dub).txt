Unleashed upon man
Their poisoning brains
An empty grasp - a threat to all those sane.

The daggers poised
For shallow minds
Unheard laughs...
Disrupting all mankind

This rotting misery

[Chorus]
The beggars are all gathered
No others rule supreme...
Rotting misery

Clouded realities
Brought before us
Their pointless lives
As all their faith is lost

Morbid existence
Of these poor souls
Now must die to exist no more

[Chorus]
