into what should not be done, into what was left undone
the way you fall onto your knees

into what should not be done, into what was left undone revealing
the fortune from your pleas

but I can't take it back, cos his soul keeps searching for more
but I can't take it back, any soul would cry out for more
but I can't take it back, no way no more

1997 Music For Nations
