A fallen time that's bygone 
A crude elite that's from a distant zone 
You turn a blind eye on what's "brave"
You don't know if it's the truth you told 

Anger looks on the quiet dreaming
Seals the sense incandescent ones 

Hold back desire for danger 
A bet you lose, you'll have no way to turn 
I see the man who lives and breathes corruption 
Into a circle that you call your own 

Don't run away, from the pain. A claim that you deal with 
A power game, from within. Impossible for you to see this 

Laid down the laws of deceit 
The ones who cherish are the ones who'll go 
Into the ashes of a tortured world 
Only in mind's eye can you see a light 

Harmony breaks, dark awakes, in old eyes - the trouble, feel it 
Here to stay, mark the way, improvise the judgement hearing 

Don't run away, from the pain. A claim that you deal with 
A power game, from within. Impossible for you to see this 

Anger looks on the quiet dreaming 
Seals the sense incandescent ones 

All remains of the glowing embers 
Is a bleak cold irrelevance
