Burning ideals light my way
Through the darkness of reality

Firepower for the soul
I don't doubt it when I have a goal

Don't count on me the day
When time will change my mind!
Don't count on me to say
"I will stay on your side"

You never cared
Nor did you ever strive to try
I don't forget and won't forgive
The day I say goodbye!

All the years that bound felt tight
Burning ideals: what is wrong or right?

Maybe I'm trapped in suspense
But keep crawlingâ 'til the end

The end

Don't count on me the day
When time will change my mind!
Don't count on me to say
"I will stay on your side"

You never cared
Nor did you ever strive to try
I don't forget and won't forgive
The day I say goodbye!
