Bow down for the great and the wise
Incoming fuck from the face to the fife
Lockjaw, how much more can you take
Of all those shit heads ego ejaculate
Swallow all that dogmatism
And be impressed of some "smartassism"
Remind the point of revenge is right
When you're all down then it is time to bite, bitch.

Shut up, one more round take your time
Wrathful patience hidden in the compline
Head down, keep it low, keep it tight
And keep the friction 'til the point of ignite
Swallow all that dogmatism
And be impressed of some "smartassism"
Remind the point of revenge is right
When you're all down then it is time to fight.

Up and down it goes
Countdown with the blows
Bang! Bang! In your head
Feels like fucking dead
Up and down and smile
Into their load of rile

We know where it goes
We know where it goes

Headfuck roller-coaster
Headfuck roller-coaster
Headfuck roller-coaster
Headfuck roller-coaster
Headfuck roller-coaster
Headfuck roller-coaster

Time to go postal

Up and down it goes
Countdown with the blows
Bang! Bang! In your head
Feels like fucking dead
Get up, raise your voice
You always have the choice

And down it goes
And down it goes
And down it goes
And down it goes

Roller-coaster
