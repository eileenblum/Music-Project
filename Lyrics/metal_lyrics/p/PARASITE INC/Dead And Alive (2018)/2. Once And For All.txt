Get up! Get up again! Hell you can make it!
Let's smile a while! We know: "Hell, you can feign it!"

The sweat, the work - you're far beyond every limit
Let's keep it up! Yet you're alive! Can you feel it?

So let's stand fast, to last and pass all the doubt and the restraint
There is no time to faint! There is no time to... fail

Their rules, your fears - that push beyond every limit
Let's keep it up! Yet you're alive!

And still I walk the line - stand fast and don't recline
Still waiting for the call to end it once and for all
And still I walk the line - to kill the void inside
Just waiting for the call to end it once and for all

Hell, to the limit!

Restart...restart again! Hell I can make it!
Let's smile a while - I know: "Hell, I can feign it!"

The love, the hate - I'm far beyond every limit!
Let's keep it up! Yet I'm alive!

How can stop this cycle,
How can I stop this world

Maybe I'm just meant to fail
'Til my live tears apart

There's no goal for those who wander
With that burning void inside

With the middle finger upward
I will keep up the fight

And still I walk the line - stand fast and don't recline
Still waiting for the call to end it once and for all
And still I walk the line - to kill the void inside
Just waiting for the call to end it once and for all

...to end it once and for all
