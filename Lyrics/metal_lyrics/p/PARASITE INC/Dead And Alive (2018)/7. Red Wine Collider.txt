That thoughts â chaos and esperance
Heavy but without any substance:
Some kind of limerence
A song of inner dissonance

I want, I want a little more
I want, I want to end that...
War â is what I try to implore
I am your innocent whore

Breakdown â dwelling in self-defense
Afraid of the ambivalence
Another painful glance
Red is the ignorance

So, I want, I want a little more
I want, I want to end that...
War â is what I try to implore
I am your innocent whore

And again I try to break through
On the bloodstream of the night
With the search for a solution
Where the sun controls the tide
Far beyond imagination
Far beyond of every time
Without any destination
Can you hear me? I'm here for you!

There is a plague, a crack in the mindset
One step ahead and 5 more to be free

No turning back when it's time to accept that
Everything will end in sanity

And again I try to break through
On the bloodstream of the night
With the search for a solution
Where the sun controls the tide
Far beyond imagination
Far beyond of every time
Without any destination
Can you hear me? I'm here for you!
