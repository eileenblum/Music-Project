Hey life what's going on?
Another day in another week is gone
And I'm out, straying through this empty night alone
On the way through the clubs
Bring the self-destruction on!

Hey waiter! Get your ass over here!

My mind and I desperately need some beer
And some strong shots
And just everything that's rad
To erase that mind
Like a bullet through the head

Hey life what's going on?
Too many situations that are going wrong
All the fails and the throwbacks are driving me insane

...And why the stupid fuck is my drink empty again?

...Get your ass over here!
My mind and I desperately need more beer
And some strong shots and just everything that's rad
To erase that mind...

C2h6o â come fuck me tight
I wanna drown in apathy tonight
The only way to end all my strife
And keeps me going â dead and alive

C2h6o â come fuck me tight
I wanna drown in apathy, alright
I leave it all on the top of the tide
I'm drowning deeper â dead and alive
