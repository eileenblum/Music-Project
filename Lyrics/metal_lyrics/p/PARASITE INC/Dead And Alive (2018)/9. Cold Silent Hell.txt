Here comes the anatomy
Of the inner me â isolated
Break down into agony
Silent casualty â fucked it up

Here screams raging apathy
Voiceless energy â correlated
Hate it but you cannot see
What's inside of me â it's all stuck

It petrifies the voice and the body
When everything is trapped under concrete skin
The feelings stuck inside without clarity
An anechoic struggle and no chance to win

Mindfuck 60 1

I am cold! I am hell! I am cold! I am hell!
I am the cold silent hell
