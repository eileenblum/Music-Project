Drown... again it's all drowning in blood
The creation's crown is back at its work

Our gods, our lies justify all our deeds
Yet we still call ourselves "homo sapiens"

Eye for an eye to the utmost
No remorse and no repent
Lie for a lie â never disclose
It goes on towards the bitter end

Hey! We are the creation's crown!
We kill and bring ourselves down!
At that time like today: eye for an eye!

Hey, let's celebrate that success
By our human progress!
At that time like today, we destroy... this world!

And we spread and we rise and devour this world
Like a cancerous cell â we destroyâ 'til we fall

Our business is death and we're doing it well
We are one, we are mankind and
We're heading for Hell

Hey! We are the creation's crown!
We kill and bring ourselves down!
At that time like today: eye for an eye!

Hey, let's celebrate that success
By our human progress!
At that time like today, we destroy... this world!
