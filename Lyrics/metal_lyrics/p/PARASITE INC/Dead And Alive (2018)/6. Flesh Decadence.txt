Heavenly is the taste of death
Shove it in! Shove it in! That piece of flesh!

Delicate, masticate, masturbate
To the taste of agony without a face
Gulp down all the ignorance
And insist on your flesh decadence

Because it tastes you presume to consume
Day by day â ignore the facts and just resume

Respect for life ends with our appetite
Incarnate double standard hypocrite

...Can't keep calm anymore ...a hunger cry
I treat you equally and make you die

And then your blood spills by the knife
When I slice you up alive
I'm fine, OK with your dying
I prefer you dead before frying

Don't cry! Later on the toilet bowl
I will give a shit on you
I'm fine, OK with your dying
Shut your mouth! Keep on dying now!

Empathy ends with our appetite
Incarnate double standard hypocrite

... Can't keep calm anymore ...a hunger cry
I bleed you out and feel delight

And then your blood spills by the knife
When I slice you up alive
I'm fine, OK with your dying
I prefer you dead before frying

Don't cry! Later on the toilet bowl
I will give a shit on you
I'm fine, OK with your dying
Shut your mouth! Keep on dying now!
