Life is a sinister one way
Blacktop made out of pain
Don't wait, don't ever regret
You stop? End of the game

Red tape on every heart
Our rules of life try to tear us apart
We made us kings and slaves
Measure the worth of all only by its sales

I'm on that road â motor to the max!
The life's dust coat â straight behind my back!
I'm on that road â leave it all behind!
Escape that life ...sunset overdrive!

Hey, just criticize! Yes, try to hurt me
But you can't fuck my mind!
So, choke on the dust when I keep smiling
And just step on the gas!

I'm on that road â motor to the max!
The life's dust coat â straight behind my back!
I'm on that road â leave it all behind!
Escape that life ...sunset overdrive!

I'm on that road â motor to the max!
The life's dust coat â straight behind my back!
I'm on that road â leave it all behind!
Escape that life ...sunset overdrive!
