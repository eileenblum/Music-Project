we are forced by rules and worth
transformed to spineless whores

blinded from consume and media
outwardness and greed

a nightmare, nicely wrapped in gold
stuffed in our heads
and are we just accept 
in our human density

bread and games modern
i call it enslavement,.. 
a mental enslavement and you call it life 

we crawl, lick asses all the day
we steal and we betray

we work and creep for more succsess
panting for wastely richness

envious... 
envious of the one, whoâs got the biggest car
whoâs got the biggest gun 
and of course the biggest one

we rush behind all trends
there is no time to spend!
we would buy a heap of shit if some trend demands it 

at expense of all others we suck up through this life
that is how we learned to be, that is all... all we can see

run... run for your life
in a world cold and insane - totally insane
carve out your life in a world where only the 
bastards survive 

choke on your lies
in a world so insensate - damn insensate 
accept the truth - cause it is just like it is: 
function or perish 

we have to function or perish
weâre slaves of their world
and to stay alive
we sold our souls
