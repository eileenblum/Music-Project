everything is a truly mad rush from the first step to the last
and i stare at empty pictures of this sick life in the past
everything i tried to reach was the illusion of a sense
to allay this futility that is pounding in my mind

but i woke up of silence 
woke up of this dream 
I am back in this bunch of shit 
in this world i never liked

and my dreams are died down in the cold of this life
burned to paltry cinders... pale and grey
and i take a last breath 
and bring it to the end
cuzâ rather i would die than crawl on knees

all hope is lost
this time forever
shattered and burned is what i loved 
all hope is lost
now more than ever
i leave and fade in the darkness

everything is a truly mad rush and i donât care of the past
i go on, walk the wicked way
that will throw my live apart
and i live in silence
shattered by my dreams
here i am in this bunch of shit
in this world i never liked
