here i am - batter me a bit deeper
tear up my life and destroy all my hopes
once again throw your unfounded wrath on me
punch harder in my pale bloodrunk face

i bear... resign... accept... decline
but be warned: iâll become your worst nightmare
so carry on heave me higher on my hate stair
remember my words, asshole
remember it every day
hear what i say:

and you run out of time: 
a night will come for the scapegoatâs revenge
around the corner iâll wait
and with a knife and a smile i am ready to commit a fair crime

and you run out of time: 
a night will come for the scapeoatâs revenge
around the corner iâll wait
and when the clock strikes midnight i will stab...
stab you to death 

here i am 
batter me a bit deeper
every further hit increases my hate

once again i feel the pain creeping through my flesh
puke blood, scream and resort in shame 

...and you weigh in secure
wallow in your reeking pride
denounce me in front of the world
despite and demean me over and over again
