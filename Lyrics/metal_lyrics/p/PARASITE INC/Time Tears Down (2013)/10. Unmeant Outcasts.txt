these strange days weâre live in are getting darker  
theyâre passing by without any change
and these dark nights we try to drown us in 
make those days more bearable for us

look out of your ideal world at us
never understanding our wrath
weâre not you and youâre not us
thus donât try to change us
go care about your own shit

we donât care about a new dawn
we need no amnesty
weâre restless selfdestructive
without a spark of dignity
we live straight for the moment
our souls already lost
cause we are unmeant outcasts 
and in -nothing- we trust

derisive laughter and scornful looks
the only thing you have spared on us
nothing more and nothing less
just because we do not fit in with your beliefs

despise us in every way you want
call us garbage or debracled scum
weâre not you and youâre not us
thus donât try to change us
go care about your shit

we donât care about a new dawn
we need no amnesty
weâre restless selfdestructive
without a spark of dignity
we live straight for the moment
our souls already lost
and if you try to fuck us...

shut up! you square! you will never understand the way that we live!
pegged out! you all! go and choke on your hypocrisy!
