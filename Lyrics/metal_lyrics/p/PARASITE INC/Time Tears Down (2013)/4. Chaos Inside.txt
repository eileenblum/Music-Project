darkness... silence - itâs so sombre here... 
no matter where or who i am
captived... condemned... to live in this shell
in my own personal hell

retreated... occlusive - what has brought me there 
and, damn...how can i return?
anguish... confusedness - am i daft in the head? 
am i here or am i dead? 
...am i dead?

slightly it drives me insane... it makes me feeling so lame 

darkness... silence - creeping through my soul
why am i like what i am?
captived and condemned to live in this place 
of blankness, hate and pungent ache

forgotten... despised - shut out of this life
wihtout a future anymore
chaos... panic - the apathy inside 
has merged and grown to endless fear

i rot down in madness
no cureâs there to expect
no future to defeate
without the past - i canât forget
it slowly drives me insane and every day itâs the same
it strangles all my feelings... 
of pleasure, teariness and shame

and i hold you to me tight
turn your days into night
there is no place you can hide
already lost is this fight
i lacerate your mind
paint your world black and white
one day iâll blow off your light
iâm your chaos inside
