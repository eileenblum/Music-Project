so you think that you know me? 
so you think that you are right?
do you really... really know me?
are you free of prejudice and sin?

wrath...hatred... who gave you the right to judge me
be...aware... of the waywardness that controls me

between heaven and hell
i am ring the death bell
filled with pure hate against this damn world
and i feel black and white
embody darkness and light
just enough for this hellride called life

so you think that you know me?
so you think that youâre right?
do you really... really know me?
how i live, what i live, what i feel?
wrath... hatred... who gave you the right to judge me?
be... aware... of the waywardness that controls me

between heaven and hell i am lost in this spell 
filled with pure hate against this damn world
and i feel black and white
embody darkness and light
fair enough for this hellride called life

beyond good and evil i am condemned in this spell
cause i am what i am - donât you know? 
and i feel black and white, embody darkness and light
just enough to destroy all my life
