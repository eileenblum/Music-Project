ânever... never againâ, 
i thought and i forgot: 
that youâre a part of me 'til the day iâm gonna rot 

i hate... i hate you but i need you to survive
cause inâ¦ in this times you make me feel alive

again you make me crawling
why donât you end it now?
this endless nights are hurting 
and the agony is on to break me down

give me a dream of reasons - inside I live apart
with you beside me... once again I am the last one in the dark 

so you... you stay with me and the days are going on
i tried and i refused but I know that you have won

how can i bear it?
how shall i spin?
this life seems so much better with the fog you drown me in 

hold... kiss... kill... me 

and in the end iâm falling
finally it ends now
this endless nights are over
in this life where you have always caught me down
you gave me dreams of reasons
inside i lived apart
with you beside me... 
finally i am last one in the dark

...in the dark
