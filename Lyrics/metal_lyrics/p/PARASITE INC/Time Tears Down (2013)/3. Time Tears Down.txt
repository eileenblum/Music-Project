endless longing
sadly burning
hided under pale gaunt skin
caged the dreams in little moments...
time will kill it all

wasted thoughts are endless turning
scars are bleeding deep inside
chains of time 
slowly lace and suffocate our hearts

with the future crossed in oceans
vaporize the efforts of our grown
never-ending ways to nowhere
thereâs no way to go
...and time tears down

endless longing 
sadly burning
wordless under asking eyes
unrequited dreams are fading...
time will kill them all

efforts used to cover yearning
dying alone with the hope
of a time never will be real

feel the heart getting cold 
in the gears of time
shining souls vaporize 
like the stars in the sky
