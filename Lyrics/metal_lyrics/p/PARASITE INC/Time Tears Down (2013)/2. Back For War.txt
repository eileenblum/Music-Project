no god damn rock stars
no image at all
too cold for their sick industry

but hey as the phrase goes: âbad weeds grow tallâ 
and we are back again!

[4x] we are back
back for... 

war is the hole
 suffering is the key
the earache will still going on
consistent, annoying, suicide in your vains
the inc is back again

no god damn rock stars
no image at all
too cold for their sick industry
but hey as the phrase goes: âbad weeds grow tallâ
and we are back again!

[4x] we are back

[5x] back for war
