heartbeat, can you be faking? 
dead inside - Iâm waking

beat me! I feel a little sick! 
where is the trick? 

your lies are on to kill meâ¦ 
kill the pulse inside me 

canât you show me a bit more? 
cut me a sore

slightly mad - slightly deadâ¦ 
where is the beat for survive? 

drive me sad - drive me dead

fuck it - I stop complaining 
no more beats remaining 
tired
coz lies can tell no trickâ¦ so sick

fuck you - I live that hellride 
with the pulse of dead inside

there is nothing to showâ¦ than empty life

and I was never alive
slightly mad - slightly dead 
there was no way for survive

drive me sad - drive...drive me dead
and there is nothing alive
all I have... all I had... 
is just the pulse of the dead 

...bequeathed: the pulse of the dead
