Ooh - when it comes to violence
I think the world will crash any day, anyway - sad to say.
Ooh - when it comes to hatred
I feel the hope is gone, sad to say - but I think that it's true.

Look around you can't you see the signs?
Open your eyes, cant you see the lies?
Hand in hand, together, violence and bigotry
Together, forever in perfect harmony...

Borrowed time - precious time - living on borrowed time
Precious time - you're living on - borrowed time
Can't you read between the lines?
Borrowed time, is this the end?
Living on borrowed time, you got to read between the lines?

Ooh - when it comes to the truth, yeah
Do you really think that they would tell you, oh no...
Ooh - you're slowly fading away
Remember what I say; remember who's claiming to be your friend...

Borrowed time - precious time - living on borrowed time
Precious time - you're living on borrowed time
Can't you read between the lines?
Ooh - when it comes to the truth, yeah
Do you really think that they would tell you - oh no...
They will tell you all is fine, everything is gonna be alright
Just close your eyes, swallow the lies and fly away - just fly away...

Try to understand - you common man
Try to understand - the world is insane
Read between the lines - you common man
You're trapped again...
