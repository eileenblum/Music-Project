Rage, it's not easy to be left behind
Let love flow, let it flush, let it take control
Take control, you got to...

Inhale - let your spirit go now
Inhale - open up your mind now
Breathe in - set your body free now
Inhale - open up your arms now

Time, only time can tell the truth you seek
And brick by brick, tear it down - uninstall
Take control, take control...

Lost in your anger
Unable to let life
Inside you
Let joy come inside
Fill you up...

Inhale, breathe in and feel god...

Heart you're in my heart
Life is a gift from god
Don't let it slip away
Don't throw it all away
Soul, you're in my soul
I'll never walk alone
I'll never let you slip away
I'll never let you go...

Inhale - breathe in
Reload and take control, control...
