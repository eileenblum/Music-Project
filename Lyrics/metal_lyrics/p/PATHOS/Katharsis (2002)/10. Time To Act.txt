Thinking about what to do
Thinking about what to say
Silence is killing our weak and repulsive youth
Can't you see what I mean?

Self-deception holds you down
Crush the illusions and make your demand
Time to act and time to be
Nothing will come out of nothing my friend.

Afraid of the struggle and the pain
Seems easier to sit down and wait
Ignorance is killing our weak and repulsive youth
Can't you see what I mean?

There is no time to waste
You got to keep the faith
Stand up, grow up.

What will you do when the end is near?
Sneer at the people who opened your eyes?
Ignorance is killing our weak and repulsive race
Can't you hear what I say?

Something is holding you down
What can it be? Can't you see?
Dishonesty is killing our wild and rejecting youth
Face the facts, make it clear.
