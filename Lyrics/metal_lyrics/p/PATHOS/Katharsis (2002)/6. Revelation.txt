Declining down the depths, down the depths of despair
Gathered in the masses, in the masses of neglect...

Amend your life - empathize - concede
Improve your life - comprehend - take control
Feel the breeze, feel the touch of god and see
How it all will end, your fate is in his hands...

Coming
A revelation
In denial...

Gathered in the masses, in the masses of neglect
Elude the facts, the facts of your life
Gathered in the masses, in the masses of neglect
Evade the facts, the facts of your life...

Coming
A revelation
In denial...(coming closer)
Coming
A revelation
In denial...(take control)

Gathered in the masses, in the masses of neglect and hate
Amend your life, concede, improve, your fate is in your father's hands
So take control, proffer your soul, the truth lays open, take control...

Feel the breeze, feel the touch of god and see
How it all will end, your fate is in his hands...
