Forever, trapped in this inner maze
Forever, trapped in this endless game...

What you see is what you get
So take your chance, fulfil yourself
What you want you'll have to catch
Be a winner outcast the rest
But don't dig your own hole...

Listen to the - lust is screaming
Listen to the - heat is rising
Listen to the - greed is calling
Listen to the - inner ego...

Forever, trapped in this endless circle
Forever, attached to this ball and chain...

Inside your chamber, inside yourself
Deep down in sleep a need unfilled
Let indolence take its place
Obey your thirst just take your turn
But don't dig your own hole...

I'm not the kind of person, that makes the world go 'round
I'm just looking for some pleasure; I need to rest my worried mind
Anxiety is my mother and my father is the lies
There's nothing unusual, we're millions by now...

Listen to the inner ego...
