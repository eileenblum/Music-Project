My heart is screaming and my vision is blurred
My soul is screaming and my eyes are darkened
Now take me away, let me breathe, let me sleep
Take me away, let me feel joy again...

My life is lonely and my future is bleak
This time I've lost it and I cant find the way out
Give me a day, give me a night, without pain
Take me away, let me feel joy again...

Born to laughter, grown up with tears
When will the pressure end?
When will it all descend?

The tide is high now and it's time to leave
This ship is ready but I'm lost, lost at sea
Now take me away, let me breathe, let me sleep
Take me away, let me feel joy again...

Born to laughter, grown up with tears
Distorted, jaded, uncontrolled

But the suicidal saviour lies...

Born to laughter, grown up with tears
When will the pressure end?

But the suicidal saviour lies...
