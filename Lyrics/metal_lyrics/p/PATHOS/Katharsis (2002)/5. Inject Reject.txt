You and me try to keep our sanity
One day we live and the other we try to runaway
Lost, lost in the passion of love
Chained to the passion of self destruction
Rise; rise as we feel it inside
Inject the fluid, it's time.

Let's hide away...

Blinded, blinded by light
What we feel is not what we get
Blinded, blinded by light
Inject the fluid it's time
Let's runaway
Push the needle, it's time to
Runaway
And leave this day behind...

Inject - Reject - Inject...

You and me want to touch the eternity
We keep on searching but nothing seems to come in our way
Lost, lost in the warmth of it's love
Chained to the passion of self destruction
Forget; reject the pain we don't want
Inject the passion, it's time.

Let's hide away...

Blinded by the light
Blinded by the light
Fill me up with your deadly love
Blinded by the light
Let's runaway
Push the needle, it's time to
Runaway
Don't want to face another day...

Inject - Reject - Inject...
