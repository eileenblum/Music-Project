Comprimated state of minds, filling up your soul
Gene's determined right or wrong, ancient times ago
The battlefield war goes on, right inside your soul
Systematic mind reclusion, disorder in control...

The pressure is building up, detonations counting down
Self destructing acts are planning, futures now in soiled
Burning karma haunt your soul, euphoria take's control
Warhead power burns your veins, filling up your soul...

Cleanse your mind
Cleanse your soul...

Destination place unknown, history's coming close
Twisted thoughts reveals the pain, discovering the legacy
Shadows from a distant time, blocks the sun away
The pressure is slowly building up, detonation's counting down...
