Instant replay, flashing scenes
Your mind is full of grief
What's your problem, give it a try
Let's step into the night
You and me and everything
You wish you could delete
You might find something inside
Katharsis deep within...

Don't hesitate, embrace what is fake
You might find something inside
You might find something that's real in the end
Somewhere inside, katharsis insight...

Precious memories, day's of old
His heart is still with you
Loneliness is eating you
Your lust has gone astray
Sleeping with the enemy
Your time has come today
You might find something inside
Katharsis deep within...

An open mind...

Mind overload - out in the cold
Spiritual deception is taking its toll
Don't hesitate - embrace what is fake
You might find something that's real in the end...

Grief don't show no mercy - time will tell the truth
You don't need no pity - depth is what you need...

Contemplating, digging deep
Inside there's something more
Throw yourself into the pit
Stripped down to the core
Pain and suffering, holds you down
Crying for relief
Examine your innerself
Katharsis deep within...

An open mind - heals your soul...
