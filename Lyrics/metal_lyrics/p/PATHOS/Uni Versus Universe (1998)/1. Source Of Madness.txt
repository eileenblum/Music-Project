Sweet sister now it's time to break away
Turn the tables, focus on your life
Dear brother, break your chains to mass so grey
Well inside you, all the answers lay

Flesh that wants
Greed to feed
Cells that split, a new breed

Source of madness
Spring of death is in your thoughts
Grand illusions we believe is true

Flesh that wants
Greed to feed
Cells that split, a new breed

Inject your thinking, into other human's minds
Spread the message, spread the seed
Elect a leader, grow the man that's worth to live
Mutate from human, into our new breed

Flesh that wants
Greed to feed
Cells that split, a new breed

Disorders change the way of man
Change the path but no one can
Elect a leader grow a man
Inject your thinking into man
