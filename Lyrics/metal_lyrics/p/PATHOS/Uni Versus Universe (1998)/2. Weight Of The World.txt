I start to wonder most everyday
Why all great moments slip away
I sense a feeling in every way
My human body starts to fade

Feel the weight of the world
On my shoulders as I kneel
From the weight of the world

What do I do for human kind
Feed the hungry lead the blind
Inside it's growing a changing scape
An inner power rules my faith

Feel the weight of the world
On my shoulders as I kneel
From the weight of the world

Try to save the world from human kind
Try to fight oppression of the mind
Use the power and the will to live
Overload aggression starts to give
I start to travel within myself
Re-discover feelings felt
The center of me my universe
Evolve yourselves and break this curse

Feel the weight of the world
On my shoulders as I kneel
From the weight of the world

Try to save the world from human kind
Try to fight oppression of the mind
Use the power and the will to live
Overload aggression starts to give

Feel the weight of the world
On my shoulders as I kneel
From the weight of the world
