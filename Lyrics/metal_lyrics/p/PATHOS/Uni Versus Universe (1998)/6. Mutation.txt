We summon our inner powers
We call on our hidden deeds
Mutation of mind in order
To muster the strength we need

We travel our inner void
A journey within our brain
Projection of thoughts inside us
The answer is still the same

To live for the moment
To live for one day
To live for the moment
This is the way

Facing our own extinction
We breed under sterile slides
Perfection of race disorders
The madman the crazy rides

To live for the moment
To live for one day
To live for the moment
This is the way

Choose to live
Evolution
The way of life
Revolution

The will to fight
Universe
Recombinate
Then emerge
