A spring of life deep within our own soul
A force we would like to control
Under the veil of the conscious mind
Way back programmed into our spine
Nothing can fill this ongoing void
The meaning of life lies within our own cells
Under the structure a beast dwells

It's in you, it's in me
It's in you, for you to see

As knowledge will be misused
And power will be abused
We try to handle truth
Ending up seeking youth

Lost in the innerspace
We try to survive the human race
Lost in our innerspace

Crying and helpless you start to slip
Under the surface you lose your grip
Into the darkness within our own mind
There's no return for the human kind
Nothing can fill this ongoing void
Lost and consumed you're destroyed
The meaning of life lies within our own cells
Under the surface a beast dwells

It's in you, it's in me
It's in you, for you to see
