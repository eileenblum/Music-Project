All that's mine, owned by time
My inner void will die, come to an end
In the fall of the human race
We will kill our god that will descend

We wish to be eternal, never see the end
Our deeds they are infernal
The given laws we bend

Universe a void to fill
To tap our souls we need to drill
Inside us the answer will live
Inside us the riddle that gives
The life as we know it will end
And the gods that we know and depend on

Uni versus universe
Uni versus us all
Uni versus universe
Uni versus us all

DNA is the way
To control human race, live to last
In between man and machine
We will kill the spirits of our past
We wish to be eternal, never see the end
Our deeds they are infernal
The given laws we bend

Universe a void to fill
To tap our souls we need to drill
Inside us the answer will live
Inside us the riddle that gives
The life as we know it will end
And the gods that we know and depend on

Uni versus universe
Uni versus us all
Uni versus universe
Uni versus us all
