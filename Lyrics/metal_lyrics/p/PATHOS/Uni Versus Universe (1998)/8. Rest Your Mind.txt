Something hides beneath our skin
Speaks to us in dreams
Destructive when we need support
Letting out it's steam
Demoralize our inner will
Nursing all the hate
In conflict with ourselves
We try to open up the gate

This time you will find
Patience, rest your worried mind

Turning loose the beast inside
Use all mortal tricks
Fulfill the dreams of instant death
Feel all senses mix

This time you will find
Patience, rest your worried mind

Lose track of time in yourself
Find yourself under a spell
You want to, you got to
You need to make it live
You will not, you can not
You must not try to give

Lose track of time in yourself
Find yourself under a spell
You want to, you got to
You need to make it live
