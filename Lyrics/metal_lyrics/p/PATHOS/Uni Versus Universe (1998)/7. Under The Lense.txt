We're building pressure, and take apart
Reproduce the lifeless heart
Explore the limits, we twist our will
In time we live to kill
Star formations cease to be

Under the lens, we will evolve
And try to all the problems solve
Inside a world, that does not fit
It will bring us to our fall

Star formations cease to be
Fragments of a race will see
Extinction of a planet small
We must change and try to
