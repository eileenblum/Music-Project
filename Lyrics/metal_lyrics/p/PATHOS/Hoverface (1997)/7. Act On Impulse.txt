A life divides in two to never be apart
A mirror who looks like you one separated heart
No one but still the same a normal reflection
Two pictures in one frame natures deception

Friend or foe the same Abel and Cain
The cut runs deep sorrow will reap
Wants to stand tall just like a wall
Build to protect a mind that's defect

[Ref:]
Act on impulse
Half way there
Into action
You're there

The left hand doesn't know what the right hand will do
Spirits return to dust you're driven by lust
Fail to see the truth distorted by youth
Facts are on your blindside as your eyes are getting wide

Friend or foe the same Abel and Cain
The cut runs deep sorrow will reap
Wants to stand tall just like a wall
Build to protect a mind that's defect

[Ref:]
Act on impulse
Half way there
Into action
You're there
