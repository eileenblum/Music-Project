Scream into the void that eats a way in you
The void that digs a hole in you
Fill it up with life

And the visions they will turn you blind
If you seek the truth behind the lie
Try to figure out the reasons why
Then you'll find the truth you can't deny

The edge is sneaking upon you
No matter what you try to do
Scared to fall into the chasm
To afraid now you will:

Turn, you'll turn away
Dare not face another day
So you'll turn, you'll turn away
Dare not face another day

[Ref:]
Show your mask, the mask of fear
You will know
Show your mask, the mask of fear
This time
Show your mask, the mask of fear
You will know
Show your mask, the mask of fear
This time

A dream seethrough, analyze the failures you do
Analyze your dreams hold on to facts within your mind

And the visions they will turn you blind
If you seek the truth behind the lie
Try to figure out the reasons why
Then you'll find the truth you can't deny

The edge is sneaking upon you
No matter what you try to doth appears
Scared to fall into the chasm
To afraid now you will:
