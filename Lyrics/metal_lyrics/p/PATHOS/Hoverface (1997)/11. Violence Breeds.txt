Red light districts breed younger victims
That pay with life to survive
Asphalt children play by their own laws
And suburbs give into crime

A new plague is running our streets and stunning
Our world that once were alive
Panic's spreading in ruins laying
The homes of the hardworking man

Weapons needed protect and feed it
Act normal and under control
Shotgun justice and we have lost it
As the child shoots the gun

[Ref:]
Our fear it feeds
Violence breeds

Drive by shootings puts the neighbourhood
Into war that spreads like a fire
Three strikes then out the system can't fail
Policemen fighting their doubts

Red light districts breed younger victims
That pay with life to survive
Asphalt children play by their own laws
And suburbs give into crime

A new plague is running our streets and stunning
Our world that once were alive
Panics spreading in ruins laying
The homes of the hardworking man

[Ref:]
Our fear it feeds
Violence breeds
