Somewhere life is moving along in its pace
A clock is still timing the race
You're caught in an empty space
Another grey day

Die with me my friends
Die with me my friends

[Ref:]
I used to trust in faith but now I know
Something will change they just will transform

Still we're moving and still improving
Our hope is glowing our faces showing
Nothing outwards a smile but still bored
Truth hits like a sword inner peace ignored

A part of you will die
And still you wonder why
A part of you will die
And still you keep on deny

Holding on of visions of good things to come
But your hope is not as strong
And your reach is not as long
And your memories gone

Somewhere life is moving along in its pace
A clock is still timing the race
You're caught in an empty space
Another grey day

Die with me my friends
Die with me my friends

[Ref:]
I used to trust in faith but now I know
Something will change they just will transform
