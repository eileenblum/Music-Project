Crack apart and slip away
Reality turns grey
Impression turns to pain, transforms
Into dreams of thorns

Into dreams of thorns
The mind it feels like scorned

Fade into a blur so dim
Fate can be so grim
Grasping for a helping hand
But alone you stand

[Ref:]
You can hear yourself say
I'm alive

Friends you lose as time goes by
Everyone stops asking why
Try to find some inner peace
Not to awake the beast

Do not awake the beast
The mind it feels like scorned

Corridors painted green, tiles on the floor
Tucked away never join reality no more
Misfit to society
Safe and sound mind is drowned
In a chemical haze
Empty eyes now your life trapped in a maze
No reliability

[Ref:]
You can hear yourself say
I'm alive

Fade into a blur so dim
Fate can be so grim
