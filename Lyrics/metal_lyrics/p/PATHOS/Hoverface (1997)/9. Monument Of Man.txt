Making it work with forced control
Pushing ones luck will take its toll
Playing a part can't change his role
Eating a way into his soul

You cannot challenge faith stop trying
You cannot sell the life you're buying
A broken spirit will not heal under pressure you will kneel
A monument of man's true nature an artifact of human traitors
A monument of man

[Ref:]
It's true the shape will change
But the mind will always stay the same
It's true the shape will change
But the mind will always stay the same

Forced to accept ones actions real
From fantasy to mortal deeds
A living lie hypocrisy
Shock to the system a life to steal

You cannot challenge faith stop trying
You cannot sell the life you're buying
A broken spirit will not heal under pressure you will kneel
A monument of man's true nature an artifact of human traitors
A monument of man (rep.)

[Ref:]
It's true the shape will change
But the mind will always stay the same
It's true the shape will change
But the mind will always stay the same
