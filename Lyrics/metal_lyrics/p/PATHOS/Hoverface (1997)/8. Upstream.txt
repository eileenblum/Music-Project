I watch the illusions parade floating down the upstream bay
Laughing at my life as they float by
I have been more accepted and less avoided
Now my feelings been misled just for fun

A garden filled with everything that suits your mind
A place to rest your head to sleep
You know that you will find
The things you need the mystic fumes
Exploring dreams in foreign tunes
The atmosphere around you are no dreams no more, so

[Ref:]
Get alive, make it real, realize because I do believe
Follow the upstream

Lost in a buzz you're afraid maybe you will have to stay
Laughing at your life as it passes by
Ascend with the fumes you inhale, just to find
That the world won't wait for you to come down

A garden filled with everything that suits your mind
A place to rest your head to sleep
You know that you will find
The things you need the mystic fumes
Exploring dreams in foreign tunes
The atmosphere around you are no dreams no more, so

[Ref:]
