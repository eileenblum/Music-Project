[Ref:]
Too much for one man to
Take and try to live through
The edge is turning to
Freedom and new life too

What now
Peoples expectations do exceed beyond the limits of reason
What if
Pressure is too much for one man to handle on his own
Cry out
Then give up and let the lethal fall do all the work they say
Strike out
No enemies are natural to humans but themselves OK
Accept
You're out and left alone in the cold for no reason

[Ref:]
Too much for one man to
Take and try to live through
The edge is turning to
Freedom and new life too
