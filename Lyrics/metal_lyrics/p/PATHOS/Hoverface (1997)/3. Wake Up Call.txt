Behind secret doors with multiple looks
In dungeons so deep a secret that shocks
One person decides distinction or not
With shaking hands and nerves disrupt

The key to the future the key to despair
Lies in his hand and this ain't fair
Cut through the silence red tape and law
A shock to the system cutting its claws

[Ref:]
A wave that shocked us all from little shack to building tall
Some kind of wake up call

A fire is breathing feed it with fear
The horsemen of darkness will appear
Sent from the heavens at the last day
The apocalypse will show us the way

Cut through the silence red tape and law
A shock to the system cutting its claws
Searching for justice finding a way
But revolution will turn the world grey

[Ref:]
A wave that shocked us all from little shack to building tall
Some kind of wake up call

Feed it with fear the end is coming feel it's near

The key to the future the key to despair
Lies in his hand and this ain't fair

[Ref:]
A wave that shocked us all from little shack to building tall
Some kind of wake up call
