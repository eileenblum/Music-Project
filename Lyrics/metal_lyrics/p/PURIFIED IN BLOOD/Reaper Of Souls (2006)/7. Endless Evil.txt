Demons dwelling in the depths of consciousness
Ready to strike my inner weakness
Seizing the chance to exploit temptations
Campaign of elimination drains my strength

Mislead into darkness- actions controlled
Mind and body slowly decay
Unable to separate right from wrong

Serpent lies embrace my thoughts
Mind tortured with inner chaos
Scarred by endless evil

Once again I stand alone to face the demons

Separate reality from fiction- ensemble the truth
Annihilate the weakness- the captor of sanity
