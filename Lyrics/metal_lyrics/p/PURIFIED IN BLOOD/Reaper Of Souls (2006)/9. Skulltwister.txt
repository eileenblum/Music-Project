Slaughter impurity
For evil hides in its depths
Exorcise and cleanse- the crushing of Satan

His wrath will freeze your blood
Burn your soul with the flames of hell
Guiding you into the storm in moments of weakness

Weapon of purity
Seal my soul with the hate for my enemies
Arm my mind with the lust to kill

Here lies the weapon
The sword that divides us from the rest
Kept close in times of war- forged in the fire of vengeance
Salvation disguised as steel- with death in every strike

Break the bones- rip the flesh
Of those who awoke your hatred
Blistering evil- behold this weapon of purity
Fractured corpses will be left to rot
Guilty blood will drip into a burning sea of torture
