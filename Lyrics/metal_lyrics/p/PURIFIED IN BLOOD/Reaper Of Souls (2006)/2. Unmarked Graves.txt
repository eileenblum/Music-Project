Suffering-makes my eyes bleed
Clear out habitat- creatures pushed towards extinction
The screams are hidden behind walls of silence
And the facts are covered so the truth wonât be seen
Subverted lies show the decay of sense and reason
A facade prepared to hide the truth

Behold a graveyard filled with unmarked graves
Dead victims without names

The water we drink is contaminated
The air we breathe polluted
My hands hold dead soil in which nothing will ever grow
And when I reach for the sky itâs already burning
The blind lead the blind towards a forsaken horizon

Behold a graveyard filled with unmarked graves
Dead victims without names

Angels will tell about this day of glory
Of this culture decline
When they have no longer to suffer in silence

Force this degraded culture out of the shadows
Shove the malice back down this throat
As it kills- so shall it be killed
This is were your selfishness ends
This is were you die
