Blood dripping from an open sky
Hailing down on burning landscape
Feeding the fire- breeding desperation
Shadows follow the storms

This must be the day when angles destroy
With flaming swords in their hands
Forging our damnation that will be earthâs liberation
Striking in despair as laments from the tongues fill the air

Insanity- the end is near
Humanity- the devil you fear

Time of descend is upon us
Justice will be received as justice has been given
Oblivious to our childrenâs heritage

Apathy came with a price
So let this be our sentence
The ultimate price
