Flaming fields-reflection of hell
Still winter reigns our hearts
The presence of death
Broken skulls beneath your feet
Vital violence- eliminate the enemy
Savage the survivor- blood flows from torture
Wasteland running red with war

Battlefield- the breeding ground of slayers
Freedom- the state of security no longer exists
Thunder- the sound of the apocalypse
Revenge and destruction
A season in total darkness and confusion

Intrunding territory- execution and extermination
Roaring guns-seeking weakness- visions of the end
Humanity falls in ruins
Burning flesh- bleeding body
Empty veins-the ruining of hearts
No one dies alone
