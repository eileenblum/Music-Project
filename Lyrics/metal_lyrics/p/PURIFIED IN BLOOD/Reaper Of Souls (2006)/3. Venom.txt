The reaper of souls- harvested by evil
Phantom freedom- the rapist of truth
Embody stupidity as sanity is burnt to ashes
Reality torn to pieces- the ruin of mortality
Death bound with damnation written in blood

Venom rushing through a body of downfall
Servant of addiction exploits your weakness
Blinded the infected- insanity will arise
Minds of decay followed by demise

Symptoms of suffocation kept silent
Enslaved mind- polluted heart-fanished brain
