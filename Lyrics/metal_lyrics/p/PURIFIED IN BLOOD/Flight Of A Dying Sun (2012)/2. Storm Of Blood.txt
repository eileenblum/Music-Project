EEEEEEEEEEAH
Born under a lunar eclipse
Rising of a new hell
Priests take their lives
one by one
Chiming bells from empty churches
Hope is gone in a destructive swell

Mountainous waves blocking the sun
Wasted and forlorn
This world is pure once again
Cleansed and reborn

Encircled by a dead dawn
I bleed the truth
Encircled by a dead dawn
I bleed the answer
Turning into the darkest ocean
Turning into the darkest ocean

Born under a lunar eclipse
Rising of a new hell
Priests take their lives
one by one
Chiming bells from empty churches
Hope is gone in a destructive swell
Mountainous waves blocking the sun

Mountainous waves blocking the sun
Ravendous clouds cover the sky
Bringing the blood that will wash the earth
Drowning the altar
Mountainous waves blocking the sun
Wasted and forlorn
This world is pure once again
Cleansed and reborn
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah
Watch the human become the beast
Watch the human become the beast
Watch the human become the beast
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah
