The world we wanted to create
Became our own isolate
Death of forests
Birth of steel
Digging into earth
With these iron hands
A thousand beasts unleashed
Unholy rituals

This iron world will rust
These iron hands will crush
Earth is no longer our domain
This iron world will rust
These iron hands will crush
What lived here were slain

Fractured nature
Clining to existence
At the mercy of machines
Profit prevails
Nothing but abhorrence
A concrete world building itself
right before our eyes

We are the locusts that plague the earth
We are the locusts that plague the earth

This iron world will rust
These iron hands will crush
Inhaling industrial smoke
This iron world will rust
These iron hands will crush
I see it all choke
This iron world will rust
These iron hands will crush
Earth is no longer our domain
This iron world will rust
These iron hands will crush
What lived here were slain

Were slain
