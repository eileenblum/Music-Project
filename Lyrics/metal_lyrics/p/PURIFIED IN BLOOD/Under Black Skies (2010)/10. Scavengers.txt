The shepherd has turned on its horde
Consumed and disposed
Scavengers
Dripping with blood

Bodies rotting in the sun
Decapitated
Speared on a pole
Iniquity beyond comprehension
Starvation
Skeletons covered with skin
Humanity
The blackest plague

The shepherd has turned on its horde
Consumed and disposed
Scavengers
Dripping with blood

The forest laid to waste
The earth is drained
Overpopulation will never be sustained
The great slaughter
Screams to the deaf

Bodies rotting in the sun
Decapitated
Speared on a pole
Iniquity beyond comprehension
Starvation
Skeletons covered with skin
Humanity
The blackest plague

The sun has set
The end is here
The sun has set
