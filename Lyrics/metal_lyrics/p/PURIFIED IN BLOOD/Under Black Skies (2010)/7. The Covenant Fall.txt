Standing in the shadow of flames
I breathe the smoke from this inferno
All of our blood sinks into the ground
The last fire on earth torch our history
Bringing shadow to all
The Covenant fall
Bringing shadow to all
The Covenant fall

Blood drenched soil
Grow into life
Forging the new breed
Bringing the new leaf
Built upon our failure

I fought the beast with all my strength
Tried to put the giant to rest
Greek fire burning
No one can end this venomous breath
Our violence was righteous
Our hatred was real
Our violence was righteous
Our hatred was real

Standing in the shadow of flames
I breathe the smoke from this inferno
All of our blood sinks into the ground
The last fire on earth torch our history
Bringing shadow to all
The Covenant fall
Bringing shadow to all

I fought the beast with all my strength
Tried to put the giant to rest
Greek fire burning
No one can end this venomous breath
Our violence was righteous
Our hatred was real
Our violence was righteous
Our hatred was real
