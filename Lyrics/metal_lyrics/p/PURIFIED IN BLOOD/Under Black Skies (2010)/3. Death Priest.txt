The cancer of this world spreading in our veins
I hear the filth paving its way
Seeking the heart
Pounding the poison
Acid rains from the sky
Ripping skin
Crushing life
The stench of death
Boundless cruelty
Roaring machines that never rest
Man-made massacre
The bringer of chaos
Man-made massacre
We're diving into nothingness

The cancer of this world spreading in our veins
I hear the filth paving its way
Seeking the heart
Pounding the poison
Acid rains from the sky
Ripping skin
Crushing life
The stench of death

The mother of all wars
An enemy without a face
One mask over another
Echoes lead the troops
A creator no one can trace
No one can trace

Be my eyes
I see what you want me to see
Innocent blood across the land
I kill what you need me to kill
Fill our hearts with war
Fill our lungs with blood
We are servants of destruction
With the death priest behind me
