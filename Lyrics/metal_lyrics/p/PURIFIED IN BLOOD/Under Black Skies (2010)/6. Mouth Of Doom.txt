Fighting the iron jaw of a hasted progress
Constructing the new life
Designed future for a hopeless path
Torn apart from nature
Dawn of a new age
Our earth changes face
Abandoned by light
Sun swallowed by darkness

Embraced by bleeding hands
Death dressed in the skin of salvation
Marching towards a burning breed
Thousand years of culture
Cut down and murdered
The collapse of everything
I erase my memories
Let humankind be undone
Living in the mouth of doom
We bury our children
Living in the mouth of doom
We bury our children
Bury our children
We bury our children

Embraced by bleeding hands
Death dressed in the skin of salvation
Marching towards a burning breed
Thousand years of culture
Embraced by bleeding hands
