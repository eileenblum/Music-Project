I swallow the sun to return with fire
I harvest this moon to feed the flames
Turn the wind
Force it higher
Turn the wind
Force it higher

We drank the ocean dry
We crushed the mountains
Creatures became mute
Rivers of blood flow beneath the pyre
Set it ablaze
Constructions collapse
Nothing lasts
What will rise from our bones
We failed to defend
This is the time to repent

I swallowed the sun to return with fire
I harvest this moon to feed the flames
Set it ablaze
Constructions collapse
Nothing lasts
What will rise from our bones
We failed to defend
This is the time to repent
Earth caught fire
Earth caught fire

We drank the oceans dry
We crushed the mountains
Creatures became mute
Rivers of blood flow beneath the pyre
