Tortured soul
Severed tongues
Blinded eyes will not behold
Jagged blade
Lacerate
Pushing forth the flood of death

Trough flesh and frost
Life is lost
Amongst sin and steel
Holocaust
Deliver me
Let me die
For nothingâs left
Terminate

Death march
I am deaf to the screams
Death march
Grinding on the weak

Tortured soul
Amongst sin and steel
Holocaust
Blinded eyes will not behold
Deliver me
Let me die
Pushing forth the flood of death

Defaced in the winters cold
Amid the darkness
Piercing through
Bleeding my sanity
Draining pains poison
Locked in
Annihilation

Through a life of persecution
Through a lifetime of pain
Like lambs lead to slaughter
