Trapped in a world plagued
Serpents,
Forked tongue rage
A vile state sovereign
Like leaches suck blood drained

Baptised in a pool of blood
Born dead
Vanished hope
From horseman's hands
Pestilence and disease

Behind my eyes planets collide
Soul torn apart
My vision blind
Rotting flesh
Earth black ash
Harvest whatâs been prophesied

Trapped in a world plagued
Serpents,
Forked tongue rage
A vile state sovereign
Like leaches suck blood drained

Baptised in a pool of blood
Born dead
Vanished hope
From horseman's hands
Pestilence and disease

Behind my eyes planets collide
Soul torn apart
My vision blind
Rotting flesh
Earth black ash
Harvest whatâs been prophesied

An echo returns cold
Between the mountains old
Along the mountainside, black skies glide
Where time stands still
Steadfast against the blizzard winds
Thunderheads
