Capitalist supremacy
Forced fed conformity
Troops collide
Cities burn
My fate is sealed
My fate is sealed
At war with reality

Spearhead to the soul of man
Invade and dominate
Social stratification shackle hands
Industrialised madness
Distort the mind

The sins of fathers
Witness
The blood of our children
Drench the sand
The sins of fathers
Witness
The blood of our children
Drench the sand

We are the slaves of this world
Captivated by our ignorance
Living in deaths embrace
Hands raised to the sky

We are the slaves of this world
Captivated by our ignorance
