Stare into the sun
The sky burns
Blinding light
Everythingâs white
Geocentric orbit
Closing in
A perfect form
Total eclipse
Erasing the flames
Erasing

The core is black
The deepest part of the mind
Twisted with despair and deceit
Core is black
The deepest part of the mind
Twisted with despair and deceit
Core is black
The tempest in my mind
Twisted with despair and deceit

The world burns
Waiting in vain
Vanishing
End is now
End is now

Darkness embraces me now
My eyes turned blind
The world burns
Waiting in vain
Vanishing
End is now
End is now
End is now

Darkness embraces me now
My eyes turned blind
The world burns
Waiting in vain
Vanishing
End is now
End is now
