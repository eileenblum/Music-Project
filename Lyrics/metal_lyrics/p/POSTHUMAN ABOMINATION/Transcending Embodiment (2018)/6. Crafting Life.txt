Initialization activity
Diagnostics of built-in sensor network
Checksum complete
Multi stage startup sequence

The first step
Of an incontrovertible breakthrough
The primitive form
To a post-anthropocentric stage
Surpassing the flesh and blood

Full body prosthetics
Replace a derelict limbless torso
Perfectly intertwined
Integrated with spinal cord and brain tissues
All processes are running
The wait is finally over

Artificial awakening become reality
Before my very eyes
Transcending the enfleshed self

Life chewed you up and spit you out
Disposable cannon fodder
Suddenly become an essential resource
A rare genetical compatibility
That makes his remains so valuable
Involuntarily sacrificed
Involuntarily sacrificed

Crafting life
An involuntary donor
Reborn as a biomimetics prototype
