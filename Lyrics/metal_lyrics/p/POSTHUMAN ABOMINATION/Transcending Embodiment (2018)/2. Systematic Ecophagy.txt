Uncontrolled mass reproduction
Assembler-based thinking machines
Spreading like pollen
Carried by the wind
Air waters and soil pollution
Airborne and waterborne transmission
Countless replicators
Unseen omen of life obliteration
Incessant overconsumption

Unrelenting replication
Mimetic evolution of living synthetic organism
Prevailing in evolutionary competition

Unmanageable by defenceless humans
Groping in the dark for a way to face the contamination

Systematic ecophagy
Unstoppable engines of destruction

Invisible army with artificial intelligence
Outnumbering endemic species
Lethal marvel of molecular nanotechnology
Advancing overpowering the survivors

Systematic ecophagy
Unstoppable engines of destruction
Increasingly hungry

Biovorous nanoreplicator
Consume voraciously human flesh
To build more copies of themselves

Systematic ecophagy
Unstoppable engines of destruction
Absorbing mutating evolving

Devouring huge quantities of biomass
Consuming the entire planet surface
Replacing it with a shapeless nanomass
Every attempt to counterattack miserably failed - nipped in the bud
Forms of life annihilated completely blindsided
Inexorable overwhelming horde
All the resources
Which allowed the exponential growth are exhausted
Remains of chaotic unformed matter
Covering the surface
Atmosphere is unbreathable
The heat is unbearable
Ecophagic nanorobots
Inexorably cease to exist
