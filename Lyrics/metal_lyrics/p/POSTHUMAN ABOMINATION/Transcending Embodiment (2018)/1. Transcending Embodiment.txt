Redesigning the limits of technology
Defying the laws of nature
From the foundations
Of human genetic engineering
Interrupting the veiling process
Reaching a new dimension of awareness
Redefining the mystery of creation

Humanity sinking in the quicksands
Of evolutionary stagnation
Collapsing in a medieval mentality
Unable to progress
Devouring every resource
Unaware slaves in a prison of flesh
Wallowing in the swamp of barbarity

Breaking the constrains of DNA
Synthesizing the essence of the soul
Overcoming organic limitations
Reaching the singularity

Incarnated man
Disincarnated angel
Synchronic entities

Transcending embodiment
Transcending embodiment

Enduring mutation
Cellular reprogramming
The deus ex machina laid aside his deity

A new dawn where humans rise from biological misery

Post biological hybridization of new species
Eradication of disease
Infinite extension of lifespan
Growing dichotomy between human and transhuman
Separation between ethereal body and dead flesh

The enfleshed infomorph
