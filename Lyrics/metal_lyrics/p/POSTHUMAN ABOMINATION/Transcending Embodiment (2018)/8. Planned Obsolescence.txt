I can see clearly
I started to piece things together

I can see clearly
Only for brief moments
Flickering
Temporary visual disturbances
Interference
Signal processing failure
Glitches
I can't filter the noise from the thoughts

During long hallucinations
Confused flashbacks
I started to piece things together
Facing contradictions and paradoxes
I know believe that my recollections
Are simply implants
Fake memories

Everything caves under the weight of mendacity
I didn't choose to be this way
Synthetically reconstructed
Living in a foreign body
Uncontrollable shivering
Interferences are increasingly frequent
Laying on the ground like a junk pile
