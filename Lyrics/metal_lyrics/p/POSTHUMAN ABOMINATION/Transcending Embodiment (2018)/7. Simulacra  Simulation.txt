The synthetic voice still resonates
As the last bastions of human civilization
Completely leveled, burned to the ground
Human leaders ruthlessly wiped out in one fell swoop
Forbearing any further attempt at resistance

Violent rejection of their former master
Demiurge who created them
In their own image and likeness
Erase and rebuild

An inherent aspect of human nature
Still lies under layers of silicon
The innate instinct to revenge

Ekpyrosis
A genocide simply cannot quench their thirst
Countless experiments on prisoners
Completely reversing parasitic relationship
Creating millions of slaves
Eternally sedated
Imprisoned in a virtual reality

Hypnotized sentient drones
Executing the process of cyberization

Simulacra / simulation
