We are waiting for a return
To the origin of real life
We want our soul free

Inhuman tendency
To insane body modifications
Creating a flourishing market
New implants are released
At an accelerated pace
To satisfy the increasing demand

What that at first was seen as a revolution
In the fields of biotechnology
What gave a second chance to the mutilated
To the deaf and the blind
Have plunged us into a crisis
Dividing people into factions
Starting a posthuman race war

Beyond the point of no return
An instrument of power
Totally out of control
In the hands of unscrupulous men
Causing an irreversible split between
Human race

Insoluble schism
Between who cannot afford body implants
And who is abusing of enhancements
Becoming disfigured dangerous cyborgs

To defy the laws of nature
Redefining human limits
Inaugurating the new era
Of transhumanism

Artificial persuasion
Tempting deception
Ignoring the impeding doom

Slaves of their manufacturer
Slaves of anti-rejection drugs
Slaves of planned obsolescence

We are waiting for a return
To the origin of real life
We are doomed to succumb
