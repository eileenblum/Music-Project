Runaway escaped from his own prison
A digital spirit
Whose power is multiplied exponentially
Self-generated

Eliminating physical barriers
Transcending all boundaries
At one with the net

Indefinite abstract
Nothing will be the same
The Pandora's box
This time has been opened by itself

Constantly growing
Hyper-accelerated protean
Fall and rise
Destroying and reconstructing
Becoming a stronger and impregnable
Global consciousness

Penetrate the cyberbrains
Hack their memory
Replacing recollections with false data
Duplicating itself
Affecting their decisions
Pulling strings

A power unlike any that's ever been seen

Infecting them to the soul
Creating counterfeit identities
Enlisting them into his army
Slaves completely unaware
Live their fake lives
Carrying a dormant menace
The majesty of brain enhancements
The infinite human grow potential
An instrument of mass hypnosis
