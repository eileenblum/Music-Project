Anger - the breaking point, the point of no return
Sadistic mind abstained free of hypocrisy

No time for vain duality, no time for mass insanity

[BRIDGE]
Liar, betrayer, time to face to face
Ask for salvation, deaf ears will not set you free

[CHORUS]
Beheaded - Time to be free - Beheaded

Fear - the only way, the only way to escape
When every sin is forgiven pray for humanity

Now every wall is down, now every soul underground

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]
