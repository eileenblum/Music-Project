I will conquer I am war
Devastate, Eliminate

I am free

Hope of freedom, mind rejected
Improved death technology

[CHORUS (x4):]
I am Divine Not Human

Darkness falls deep into me
Destruction, confusion controlling my fear

I am free

Pointless lives beg for salvation
Inhuman thrash killing machine

[CHORUS x8]
