Ever and ever I open my eyes
Searching for something, found only pain
Something I could not control
Breaking, holding my thoughts

[BRIDGE (x2):]
Faceless agony - Playing with my sanity

[CHORUS (x2):]
Break Point - Break

Searching for a new kind of hope
A new way to find serenity
Between two worlds of hope and chaos
Salvation and demise

[BRIDGE x2]

[SOLO]

Dark silhouettes fly over my soul
With broken wings leave nothing but hate
Surrender, try to understand
Play dead, dead before my eyes

[BRIDGE x2]

[CHORUS x3]
