I try so many different ways
I fight the pain that holds inside
The wall that bears the agony
Too deep to justify my sanity

[BRIDGE]
I hold the darkness in me... I hold my own salvation

[CHORUS]
Join the new world
Gather a new breed

Too blind to see the truth within
Now what? Bow to the ones who stand
In line a fucking seed of power
Behold the slavery that hides beneath

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

I pray for no one but my self
I seek for nothing to be found
But why? I die, I resurrect
Inside, inside no one can hear my screams

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
