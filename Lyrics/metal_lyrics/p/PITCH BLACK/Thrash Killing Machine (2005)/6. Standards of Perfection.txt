Inner activity processing the pain
Honour, pride creates agony
Injecting the strain (faithless) and senseless minds
Will soon gather to witness a new perception

Why did they choose me? Why did I fall?
Hate, delusion brings nothing but fear
Conquer the throne, release my deepest anger
Let war lead us to doom and find peace among the dead

Salvation - Demise - Inflicting the pain among the sinners

[SOLO: Ana Prestes]
[SOLO: SÃ©rgio Vilas]

Summon the demons crawling inside me
Ripping, leaving my body's remains
Cover your eyes (faithless) open your mind to them
Fear me! Hate me! Feed me! I am God!

[CHORUS]
