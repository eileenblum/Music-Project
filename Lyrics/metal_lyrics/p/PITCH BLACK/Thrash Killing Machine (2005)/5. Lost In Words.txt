So deep, hollow emotions
No end, the truth - take it away
I see darkness in me
Deep in I fall - empty illusions

Alone, pain disappears
Be free to feel - manipulate
Follow and then you fall
Create inside - trapping your fears

[CHORUS]
Lost in my pain
I feel I die
Lost in my words
I believe

I pray, bleeding away
Dying inside - sense of demise
Too late, time to create
One dream, one night - one final hour

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

Believe the fear that hides
Beneath without conclusions
Of what, what to expect
Of life, of emptiness

[CHORUS]
