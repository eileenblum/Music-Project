"Far away from imagination
Somewhere beyond shades of time
A land of dreams of an ancient belief
An old knowledge of freedom and peace
Sin and fear created by man
Created minds of man of no stand
No time for human compassion
No time for human forgiveness"

REMAINS OF THE PAST!!!

Inside human breed, a life of sin
Disgusting truth, see nothing
Conceiving a temptation
The loss of inner sense

I see the tears, the blood
No way, No mercy!!!
Wake up hear the silence
It will embrace your mind...

[CHORUS]
Suicide..
Dead remains...
Suicide...

Look out, the final night
The final prayer, the final sight
Old book's a contradiction
A dream, an infliction

[CHORUS]

Free-Another human sin
Future-In any man's dream
Bring-The final conflict to
Another life, another time
Any time...

[Solo]

Free-Another human sin
Future-In any man's dream
Bring-The final conflict to
Another life, another time
Any time...

REMAINS OF THE PAST!!!
