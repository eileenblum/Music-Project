Falling from out of nowhere
Wings of freedom make you swear
Devil's son let us believe
The sinner flies somewhere

Stormy seas of destruction
Blowing winds of man's rejection
Angel's breeze over the sky
Flies in high perfection

[CHORUS]
Deceptive sinner
Human sense of pain

Where deceit enrages fear
Hands of justice coming near
Time to turn it into tale
End now is clear

He will change destiny
Future of humanity
Cross the inner gates of time
To reality

[CHORUS]

No one left to see another silent dawn
No one left to hear another silent scream
I will sacrifice my sight
I will burn until I fight
Find my destiny in life

[CHORUS]

...OF PAIN!!!
