I see innocence
Silence without sense
Man who once believed in faith
I fight to believe
For what you deceive
Every night I watch the sky

[CHORUS]
No Justice - No Peace

Order of Disgrace
Blackened nights I face
Spill the blood of those who sin
He who lies betrays
Those who spent the days
Fighting for long waited dreams

[CHORUS]

[Solo]

[Repeat 3rd and 4th]

[CHORUS]
