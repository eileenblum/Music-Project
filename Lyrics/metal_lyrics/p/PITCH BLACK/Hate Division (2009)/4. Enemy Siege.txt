Now the last man has left the trenches
Forsaken hope and mind resigned
Last breath and plunged in darkness
Glory awaits in the head of a bullet

[CHORUS:]
Enemy Siege
Bring forward death no human defense

Machine gun nests are set and waiting
For the swarm of lost souls arising
One shot, one kill, one loss
Glory awaits in the head of a bullet

[CHORUS:]
Enemy Siege
Bring forward death no human defense
Enemy Siege
Bring forward death no human defense

[SOLO]

I saw demise upon the week
I will remain relentless to attain
The killing, the thrilling begins
Unleashing hell defenseless to the pain

[CHORUS:]
Enemy Siege
Bring forward death no human defense
Enemy Siege
Bring forward death no human defense

Bring forward HATE no human defense
Bring forward death
Bring forward HATE no human defense
Bring forward death
