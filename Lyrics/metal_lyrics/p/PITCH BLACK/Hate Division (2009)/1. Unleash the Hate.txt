I have been written within these walls
The anger in myself for years to come
With no compassion, without forgiveness
Forever dead and forever dreaming!

So why try so much to fit in?
There's nothing that can fill this gap
Like every time you think it's over
I will comeback, my HATE will be heard

[CHORUS:]
Slay! Unleash the human rage within
I'm every men, I'm every soul
Face! Unleash the HATE that grows inside
Kill! Unleash the new fucking HATE!!!

GO!

[SOLO]

They say I'm dead but my world prevails
Behind these thoughts you may object
Before you can see the truth in yourself
Will come the time, to unleash my HATE

[CHORUS:]
Slay! Unleash the human rage within
I'm every men, I'm every soul
Face! Unleash the HATE that grows inside
Kill! Unleash the HATE
Slay! Unleash the human rage within
Unleash the HATE!!! The true, the new fucking rage!!!
