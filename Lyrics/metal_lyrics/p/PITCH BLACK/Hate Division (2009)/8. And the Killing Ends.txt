Now is the time to raise the HATE inside
To be reborn and face this truth with courage
I will be near when all your dreams are lost
With raging violence, I'll break the strength in you

[CHORUS:]
And the killing ends!

Prepare to see what you have done to others
For the time will come when I surpass these feelings
From deep inside from deep my inner self
With raging violence, I'll break the strength in you

[CHORUS:]
And the killing ends!
You will break!

Memories passing by
We bleed... mercy!!!

Mercy!!!

Memories passing by
We bleed...

Now is the time to shred your hopes apart
To see within your deep, sick, human pleasure
This is the chance to make it all worth
With raging violence, I'll break the strength in you

[CHORUS:]
And the killing ends!
You will break!
And the killing ends!
You will break!

You will break!
Break!
