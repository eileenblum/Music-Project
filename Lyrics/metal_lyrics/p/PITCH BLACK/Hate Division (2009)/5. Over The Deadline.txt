Step forward now! I will not hold my anger
Step forward! Revenge comes in between
Revealing the truth about yourself
Revealing the HATE within

The HATE within!

[CHORUS:]
One step over the deadline
One step over!

Bring down the pain! Life washing all intentions
Bring down! Forget what we have learned
Believing in some place out of reach
Believing the truth inside

The truth inside!

[CHORUS:]
One step over the deadline
One step over!
One step over the deadline
One step over!

[SOLO]

What have I done? To make you feel it coming?
What have i become in this illusion?
Releasing the stream of my emotions
Releasing the hatred in you!

The hatred in you!

[CHORUS:]
One step over the deadline
One step over!
One step over the deadline
One step over!
