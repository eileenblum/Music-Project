When everything looks wrong in your eyes
Remember pain will always be near
For you to judge all your primary instincts
A day will come, a new hope will rise

[CHORUS:]
Now I'm different to the ones who betrayed me
Now I'm rising but nothing will change
Nothing will ever change!

To every time you look at yourself
With all your lies and you think you can judge me?
Your prison life is one step behind
Become the pain and the HATE of the living

[CHORUS:]
Now I'm different to the ones who betrayed me
Now I'm rising but nothing will change
Now I'm different to your eyes
Now I'm rising but nothing...
Nothing will ever change!

[SOLO]

As I rise from the ground
I feel the HATE inside me
It makes me stronger than ever!
But for you, the weak, nothing will change!

Protect the truth and become restrained
To your reprisal that won't be the last
I become one with the fallen betrayers
Death will remain a scar in my soul

[CHORUS:]
Now I'm different to the ones who betrayed me
Now I'm rising but nothing will change
Now I'm different to your eyes
Now I'm rising but nothing...
Nothing will ever change!
