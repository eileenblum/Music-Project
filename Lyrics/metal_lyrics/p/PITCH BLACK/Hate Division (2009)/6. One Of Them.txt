Walk over! The path of oblivion
Wake up! Last second survival

HATE will not hold
Faith will not stand

One! One of Them! One!

Survive! Look deep around you
Uncover! The bodies stench of death

HATE will not hold
Faith will not stand

[CHORUS:]
Control! Resist! Last chance!
Become one of them!
Control! Resist! Last Chance!
Become!

............

I can not breathe
I can not wait
I can not see
I can not be dead

Dead! Dead! Dead!

One look! You face your destruction!
Life ends! Life begins

HATE will not hold
Faith will not stand

[CHORUS:]
Control! Resist! Last chance!
Become one of them!
Control! Resist! Last Chance!
Become!
