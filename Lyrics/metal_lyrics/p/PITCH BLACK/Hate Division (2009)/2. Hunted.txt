One thousand Ambitions
You dig your way out
The lowest form of lies
How does it feel? How does it feel?

Repent your denial
My gun remains overloaded
Look up to me and see
How does it feel? How does it fell
To bear the last mark of HATE

[CHORUS:]
HATE inside!
I will hunt you
HATE inside!
I'm the hunter
I will nail you down!

[SOLO]

Inside pain will grow
Into abomination
With open mind I see
How does it feel? How does it feel
To bear the last mark of HATE

[CHORUS:]
HATE inside!
I will hunt you
HATE inside!
I will hunt you
HATE inside!
I'm the hunter
I will nail you down!
