No retreat - This way leads to the weak
No refuse - A taste of good old news

Sense this feeling - There is no way of healing
Every pain - Becomes our own domain

[CHORUS:]
Walk on Main Street
Thrash Metal elite
Blood heal, dead meat

Look behind - No HATE left for the blind
Time to fight - This union's back in sight

No way out - Stand proud and shout!!!
We control - Breathtaking Rock N' Roll!

[CHORUS:]
Walk on Main Street
Thrash Metal elite
Blood heal, dead meat - Welcome!
Walk on Main Street
Thrash Metal elite
Blood heal, dead meat
This is the feast!

NO retreat - This way leads for the weak
No refuse - A taste of good old news

No way out - Stand proud and shout!!!
We control - Breathtaking Rock N' Roll

[CHORUS:]
Walk on Main Street
Thrash Metal elite
Blood heal, dead meat - Welcome!
Walk on Main Street
Thrash Metal elite
Blood heal, dead meat
This is the feast!

For us all, we'll strike with no remorse!!
