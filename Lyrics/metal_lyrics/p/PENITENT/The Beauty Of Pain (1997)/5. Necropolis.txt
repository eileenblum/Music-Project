Many have walked upon this path before me.
Many have been tricked, but I was not.
Here many spirits are haunting me.
I feel the untouchable fear.
It is empty but my eyes still see,
although they are covered by tears.

I still hear the screams of sorrow.
This is the beauty that fills my soul.
In our hands we carry the ancient flame.
The most powerful weapon of all times it is.
We walk in the footsteps of our ancestors.
They who once proudly came here to die.

We are at the same place, but yet another age.
Certain things will always remain the same.
We are now falling into other souls.
They are so many but yet alone.
Everything we pass are scary piles of pain.
That who has been will be burned into our brains.
Unbreakable are the chains of our memories.

Never will I be the one who denies to see.
Still I am able to touch the fear.
Screaming are the thoughts who call upon my soul.
Love is not all and will not come to you here.
Here the silent sorrow tells the whole story.
Now I can see that very spot to myself.
Nothing about this sacred place have I forgotten.
