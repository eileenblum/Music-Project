Intense pain.
Deep is the pain of hope.
A feeling you wish for.
You are waiting for a new era.
Impossibility is the name of your hopes.
On the lap of the missing you are carried away.
A thought it is not.
Only your own desires.

"In the night you can hear my voice.
In some you hear my painful screams.
When we are apart I have no choice.
Then I listen to your voice of sadness.
In the night you can see my wounded heart die.
At dawn you can hear me call your name.
When I return I wish to find you there."

One do not wish to die but to rest eternally.
To rest for ever and ever is again a seed.
A place where I decide who stays or not.
Where there is death there is life.
A life beyond the understandable.
A world you can not imagine.
Here I feel complete.
