There is a passage.
A sparkling gate to a world unknown.
Many paths to walk upon.
Roads that are not for humans.

Visions of a long forgotten land.
A world untouched by man.
Below is the pit of cold winds.
A place where hollow anxiety reigns.

Cold is the universe of intense wishes.
An eternal emptiness.
Infinite is the longing.
The wish to enter this passage.

Intense is the wish that won`t fade away.
Longing for the ultimate fire.
The suffering in the valley of death.
For ever the flames will eat your flesh.

I need no suffering flames.
That I have experienced here on earth.
Send me into the great inferno.
For it is there my soul belongs.
