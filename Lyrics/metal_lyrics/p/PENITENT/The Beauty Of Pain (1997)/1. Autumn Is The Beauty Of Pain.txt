Surrounded by septemberstorm and frosty rain.
Outside I am walking in my own loneliness.
Around me people walk with bended heads.
We all have many thoughts to sort out.

I am outside to touch and to feel the coldness.
Every single person in this town is depressed.
Wind and clouds make me wonder.
What kind of lives do these slaves live?

Rain keeps falling down this evening.
A storm comes in from the North.
Nothing is comparable to the autumn rain.
Dark and sullen, but a beauty to me.

There is nothing more beautiful than this.
Grey and depressing this time of year is.
It has always been my best company.
Different grades of loneliness it holds.

This is the seed of life.
Its sadness only makes me stronger.
Hour after hour I can spend in the rain.
Just to experience the beauty of pain.
