The sun is going down.
Night is closing in.
Darkness falls upon the land.

Nobody knows when the day will come.

The sun has gone down.
The wolfs supremacy rules.
Show weakness and it will tear you apart.

The plague kills the children of light,
who are wandering in the dark.
A new era has just begun.

Now I can see it.
Black is the sun shining.
There will be no more dawn.
