"The painful screams of the body,
that is what you can hear...

...before you meet your own shadow."

The path of sorrow I walk upon.
Getting more sad for every step I take.
Darkness cover my eyes.

The roads obstacles I have met.
No light is present on my path.
The end of the road is near.

Kindness is a lie.
Sorrow is my friend.
My way is walked.
