In the mist of the night you faded away.
Like a star you fell from heaven.

The dead life vanished into nothing
when angels sang songs of painful beauty.
You were filled with the joy from your tears.

Like an arrow from the bow
you shot yourself into the universe.
You stranded somewhere in the infinitely.
