You will give me your heart.
That`s what I deserve.
Forever mine to keep.

That`s your gift to me.
It`s your own life,
but you sacrifice it.

You live for happiness.
Such a thing does not exist.
Just one of your illusions.

Happiness does not exist.
Only the beauty of pain.
Your life is mine to keep.

Farewell to you.
Now that your flesh is mine,
I`ll take your soul too.
