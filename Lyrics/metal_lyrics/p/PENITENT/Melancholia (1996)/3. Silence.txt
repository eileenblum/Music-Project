Quietly we are sitting there.
Touched by silence.
Everything else has disappeared.
Time goes by,
but still everything is silent.

Suddenly you can hear the rustling.
The flames stands high.
You can hear the beams fall
when they hit the floor,
but still everything is silent.

The silence is unbroken.
Strengthened by the silent puff of wind
we sit there all by ourselves.
Nothing trembles us from our trance.
The satisfaction consist of other peoples pain.
