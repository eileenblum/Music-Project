A pale shadow I am.
The shadow of my early existence.
A depressed being...
Filled with the joy of sorrow.

I am not of their kind.
Of sorrow I was born.
Gloomy are the feelings carried inside.
Dark is the core of my soul.

Feel the grief of an empty heart.
My heart is shattered.
Silent is my tears.
Quietly they sweep my face.
