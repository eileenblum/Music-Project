Death kills the flame of life.
Ends our present existence.

A transformation to come.
Death of the former self.
The total destruction of form.

We turn loose the old,
and face our own renewal.
The recognition of ones true being.

Death and birth.
None will be avoided.
Both part of a never-ending cycle.

All roads unite in dark decay.
Eternal is the deep depression.
