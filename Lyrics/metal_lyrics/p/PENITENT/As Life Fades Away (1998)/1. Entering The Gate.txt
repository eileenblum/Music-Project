I sat under the arrow of mourning...
Washing my mind in the rain,
while counting the drops as they fell down.

I found the key to my soul.
Hidden in the garden of memories it was.

I listened to the voice of silence,
and moved into the unknown with a calm soul.

Away I rode on waves of pain.
I vanished into the realms of sorrow.
