My excentrifying impulse
Tell me.. Please
Brothers rip the wings off
The sky in flames

The stargates crumbles
Into my fields of misery
Betrayal of the gates
(famous explorer in head)
Drink the serum to explore
Drink... drink at me

Skull smashing anaesthetic surgeon in mind
So they closes my passage to freedom

Anaesthetic? Me live!
Sky purple... colour dead
Dead puppets

I refuse to believe
My manifest... My madness

The stargates crumbles
Into my fields of misery
Drink the serum to explore
Drink at me

My manifest... My madness
