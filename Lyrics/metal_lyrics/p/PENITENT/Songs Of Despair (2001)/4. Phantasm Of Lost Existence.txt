In a long wrathless reverie
Spectacular displays of human suffering
Wrapped in endless cycles
Understanding life and death
To suffer all its torments
For a few moments of glory

Eternal fire and torment
Everlasting torment
Until time is no more

I felt life burning
Through the coldness of myself
Invading every particle of me
I felt pain in my heart
I was too miserable
To take much consolation from feeling good

Eternal fire and torment
Everlasting torment
Until time is no more

I felt that profound release
Of the utterly grief-stricken
I was perishing from exhaustion
I was worn and miserable
Like mortals who tumble through life
From cradle to grave in oblivious slumber
