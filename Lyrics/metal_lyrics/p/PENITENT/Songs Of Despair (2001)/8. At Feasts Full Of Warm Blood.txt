Good and high.
The sky darkened. 
The sweet blood coming on. 
Dark and deep. 
A grey anvil of clouds.
Thoughts spinning away.
Broken by a hollow whistling sound. 

The life on blood.
I was back in the woods again.
An awesome piece of work. 
Sparkling like frosted flakes.
A delicate one.
Sugar to my vampire eyes.
Sparkling like a spider web. 
I stop on the path sprinkled with dew. 

Alive on blood a grey shadow drops.
Like a stone. Rises with beating wings. 
Over a thin chattering sound. 
Flickering torches. 
A graveyard at dusk. 

The soft glow of a cavern.
The lore of vampires.
Other things are good in their ways...
...but give me blood. 
Darkness in latitudes falls swiftly. 
At feasts full of warm blood.
