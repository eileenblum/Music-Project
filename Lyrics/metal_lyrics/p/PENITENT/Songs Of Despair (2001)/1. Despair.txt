A deadly suffering filled with pleasure. 
A necessity giving you the breath of life.
Behind the black mask... 
Beyond the night. 
In silent solitude one dwells in sadness.
Death smiles to me... laughs at me. 

A millennium of nights shall be mine. 
Desperate is the senselessness of time. 
An ocean of darkness. 
Unbearable is the pain of doom.
A wretched beast of remarkable dreariness. 

The feeling of being abandoned caught me.
A loneliness calmer than any emotion. 
The deadly silence. 
A suffering expressing the most exquisite beauty.
I felt lost... Almost desperate.
