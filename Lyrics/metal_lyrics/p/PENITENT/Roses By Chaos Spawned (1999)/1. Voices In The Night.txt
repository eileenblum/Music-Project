A whisper along the edge of dawn.
The darkness of night holding its breath.
Suffering a cosmic loneliness.
My constant shadow touched me.

Blessing the whispers of the night.
The voice of the underworld.
Suffering in a lonesome wilderness.
Night took on a deathly look.

Dancing into the unknown.
Now I see... I see their faces.
Their eyes glowing in the night.
Becoming one... Becoming Eternity.

I listened to the voice of silence.
Voices in the night...
Sing your songs of despair.
Mournful... Yet filled with joy.
