In utter oblivion
In the pale moonlight
Beyond the bounds of eternity
I longed for death

A blur of misty blue
A trick of blinking
Relapsed into deep thoughts
Into silence

Silence blossom into embrace
Of the sorrows of pain and regret
I grasped the scourge
I felt such a craving for pain

The concubine of my desires
For love and beauty
Shrouds on a night-blue sky
The splendour of hidden glories

A veiled... Starry sky
A dawn of chaos
I wanted to die so fiercely
In an avalanche of crimson light
