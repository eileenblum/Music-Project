I dream, streets pathed with gold
I dream, comforts when I grow old
now its daybreak, cruelly I wake
alone and cold with hunger stored
for another day.

Treated like Pariah,
no saving grace
no bell around my neck, but I'm a leper
to the human race
just like Pariah, I have no name
living in a blaze of obscurity
need courage to survive the day

Every hour is dark, life is scarred
with degradation and scathing remarks
pride just chose to hide
leaving you alone with no strength
to carry on, but you carry on

Treated like Pariah,
no saving grace
no bell around my neck, but I'm a leper
to the human race
just like Pariah, I have no name
living in a blaze of obscurity
need courage to survive the day

The future is in decay,
no leaf for losers on the status tree
on your knees you'll live and die
for the eyes of society
always bring you down
see you as a clown

Treated like Pariah,
no saving grace,
no bell around my neck
but I'm a leper all the same
just like Pariah, I have no name
living my life in obscurity
needing courage to survive the day
