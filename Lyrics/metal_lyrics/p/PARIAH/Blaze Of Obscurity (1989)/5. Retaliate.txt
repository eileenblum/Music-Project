I believe, nothing in life,
comes with its price
to stay alive in a world of contempt
you better learn to fight.
don't show weakness
they'll walk all over you
learn to be a bastard too

I believe in freedom
the right to live in peace.
but remember when you're struck in the face
never show defeat.

Retaliate, don't turn, don't turn,
don't ever, turn the other cheek
Retaliate, don't turn, don't turn,
don't ever, turn the other cheek

Don't starve, don't deprive your pride
of virility
Strength will gain respect, not civility.
don't show weakness
they'll walk all over you
learn to be a bastard too

I believe in violence
but not for violence sake
defend, when it comes to pain
give it don't take.

Retaliate, don't turn, don't turn,
don't ever, turn the other cheek
Retaliate, don't turn, don't turn,
don't ever, turn the other cheek

I believe, nothing in life,
comes without its price
to stay alive in a world of contempt
you better learn to fight.

Retaliate, don't turn, don't turn,
don't ever, turn the other cheek
Retaliate, don't turn, don't turn,
don't ever, turn the other cheek
