Is it an act of compassion, or a crime?
to end the life of a friend who wants to die
once sound of body and sound of mind
now plastic tubes to stay alive
he finds the strength to look me in the eye
(and say)

Take this life from me
don't make me live (please let me die)
if you're my friend you'll let me die

Take this pain from me
don't make me live
Missionary of mercy
help me die
Missionary of mercy

How can I be convicted for killing pain?
I'm being crucified, the law provides the nails
the jury must decide -- wrong or right?
the book spells it out in black and white
you'd never understand unless you heard the cry

Take this life from me
don't make me live (please let me die)
if you're my friend you'll let me die

Take this pain from me
don't make me live
Missionary of mercy
help me die
Missionary of mercy

Please! sever the veins of my agony.
Please! let tranquillity cover me.

One vision, you'll sentence me
cripple me with a lecture on my ideals
but nothing you do, nothing you say
will make me repent the decision I made

It was an act of compassion not a crime
to end the life of my friend
who begged to die
once sound of body and sound of mind
then plastic tubes to stay alive
finding the strength to look me in the eye

Take this life from me
don't make me live (please let me die)
if you're my friend you'll let me die

Take this pain from me
don't make me live
Missionary of mercy
help me die
Missionary of mercy
