We strike a blow for justice after
years and years of suffering
at the hands of an organization bent on
butchering
yet enemies in our midst
won't let the matter rest
demanding attention as they stir the
hornets nest.
yes anything goes -- political profiting.

Are you with or against us?
whose side are you on
don't try to tell me you're a friend
you're not your mother's son

With friends like you, who needs an enemy
gouging from within
With friends like you - who needs an enemy
enemy within

It's people like you undermine a nations security
wallowing in a cesspit of false morality
perfidious, feeble, weak
they slap your face and you'll turn
the other cheek
preaching from afar while our best
men die for your liberty

Are you with or against us?
whose side are you on
don't try to tell me you're a friend
you're not your mother's son

With friends like you, who needs an enemy
gouging from within
With friends like you - who needs an enemy
enemy within

All our so called friends seem to criticise
blessed in ignorance,
atrocities rarely publicised
we've got to shoot to kill
retaliate at will
fight for freedom and democracy
but still
we find our motives questions by the
ones on our side

Are you with or against us?
whose side are you on
don't try to tell me you're a friend
you're not your mother's son

With friends like you, who needs an enemy
gouging from within
With friends like you - who needs an enemy
enemy within
