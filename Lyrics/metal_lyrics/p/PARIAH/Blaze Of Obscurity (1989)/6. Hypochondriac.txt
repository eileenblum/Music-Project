Take a look at yourself,
you're wallowing in self pity
drowning in your minds morbidity
concern for your health
will lead to your death
a victim of your own anxiety

Hypochondriac, morbid anxiety
Hypochondriac, the way that you think,
is not the way that you feel
No medicine prescribed by any doctor
can cure you of
your pessimistic melancholy views
there is no remedy for your mortality
treatment for your ailment a fallacy

Hypochondriac, morbid anxiety
Hypochondriac, the way that you think,
is not the way that you feel

Tranquilisers act as your solution
relief is found, but not recovery
not thinking they can kill
you gorge yourself with pills
death by overdose, fatality

Take a look at yourself,
you're wallowing in self pity
drowning in your minds morbidity
concern for your health
will lead to your death
a victim of your own anxiety

Hypochondriac, morbid anxiety
Hypochondriac, the way that you think,
is not the way that you feel
