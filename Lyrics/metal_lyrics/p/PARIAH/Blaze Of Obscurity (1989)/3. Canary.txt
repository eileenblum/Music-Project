You've sold out the family
abused our generosity
now you repay our loyalty
by singing to the enemy, treachery!

a cosa nostra boss as meat
give us your statement so we might feed
we'll give contractual guarantee
a new identity -- for the face of the enemy

(you won't) sing canary, won't you sing for us
(you've got to help yourself, consider no-one else)
Sing! Canary, won't you sing for us
(we'd like to be your friends, protect you
to the end)
Sing! Canary, won't you sing for us.

They've broke him, we've lost a trusted man
we must strike back, here is the plan.
through the grapevine we will make it clear
let all canaries live in fear, treachery!
(must never breathe the air again)

a cosa nostra boss as meat
give us your statement so we might feed
we'll give contractual guarantee
a new identity -- for the face of the enemy.
(won't you) Sing! Canary, won't you sing for us
(you've got to testify your truth you can't deny)
Sing! Canary, won't you sing for us
(let your secrets bleed your safety guaranteed)
Sing! Canary, won't you sing for us.

You have bitten the hand that feeds -- Judas!
once a brother, now an enemy
thought we'd forgotten, thought you were safe?
it's taken years but now we've found you
and you will never sing again

a cosa nostra boss as meat
you gave your statement so they could feed
you signed your own death warranty
and slow your death shall be.

(won't you) die Canary, won't you die for us
(sold out the family, die for your treachery)
Die! Canary, won't you die for us
(betrayed the brotherhood, now you pay in blood)
Die! Canary, won't you die for us
