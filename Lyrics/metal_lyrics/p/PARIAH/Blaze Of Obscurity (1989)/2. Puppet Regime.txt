From this moment on we own your soul
we'll manipulate your future
we'll tell you how to look -- what to do and say
you get fame -- we get power

Don't worry about a thing
don't even try to sing
your talent's just a stumbling block
(when you're)
subjects! in our puppet regime
(in our puppet regime)
subjects! in our puppet regime
(in our puppet regime)

Blaze of publicity -- we'll galvanize your name.
with manufactured illusions
we'll make you fit the scene -- then serve
you on a plate
syphen the public's conclusions

Don't worry about a thing
don't even try to sing
your talent's just a stumbling block
(when you're)
subjects! in our puppet regime
(in our puppet regime)
subjects! in our puppet regime
(in our puppet regime)

From this moment on we own your soul
we'll manipulate your future
we'll tell you how to look -- what to do and say
you get fame -- we get power

Don't worry about a thing
don't even try to sing
your talent's just a stumbling block
(when you're)
subjects! in our puppet regime
(in our puppet regime)
subjects! in our puppet regime
(in our puppet regime)
