Why do you try to be
Something that you're not?
Always insinuate
You've got more than you've got
We disassociate ourselves from the likes of you
If you want in don't tell us what you are but who

You try so hard but always fail
You might be something but to no avail
'Cos unless you're one of us
You'll never make the grade
And if you're one of us
You've got it made

Pose striking and dropping names won't get you anywhere
No chance to prove yourself
We don't even care
Don't forget on your way out of here
To send the next one through
It's nothing personal
Just you're not on our who's who

You try so hard but always fail
You might be something but to no avail
'Cos unless you're one of us
You'll never make the grade
And if you're one of us
You've got it made

Why do you try to be
Something that you're not?
Always insinuate
You've got more than you've got
Don't waste time tryin' to make rhyme
Gotta make the best of what you are
This social status thing has really gone too far
