Do you remember when the wall came down
Some people said that it was just the start
Of new relations and world unity
Now years down the line we've yet to see

We still haven't seen the future to be
Thirty years from now
Are yesterday's dreams tomorrow's reality?

One small step for a man
One giant leap for mankind
A step towards new frontiers
Leaving the cold war behind

One small step for a man
One foot each side of the wall
A step towards who knows where
We're still learning to crawl
