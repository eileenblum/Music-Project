Time for the last goodbyes
To the place you once called home
Running from the genocide
People together, yet a people alone

Kicked from one camp to another
Hellholes riddled with disease
Not enough food to share amongst your brothers
So many dying on their knees
Refugees

Another mile until you reach your goal
You walk in circles lost without a home
Another border another danger zone
Walking wounded, on your own
Refugees

Another mile until you reach your goal
You walk in circles, far from home
Fire and bullets fly from every side
And the world watches
Only a camera away

Forced into evacuation
To escape these killing fields
Better to die than face repatriation
At the hands of the latest tyranny

Another mile until you reach your goal
You walk in circles lost without a home
Another border another danger zone
Walking wounded, on your own
Refugees
