I don't want to invade your thoughts
I know it's strange
But I can't help wondering why
We seem to share this space internally

How does it feel?
On the other side of the line
Do you share the same emotions as me?
And how would it be
If we both crossed over the line
Is this hell or Mutual Street?

I don't want to reveal my deepest thoughts
Not to anyone
Now we can see things through each other's minds
Just to find we're all the same beneath it all

How does it feel?
On the other side of the line
Do you share the same emotions as me?
And how would it be
If we both crossed over the line
Is this hell or Mutual Street?

Man to man, communion of the mind
As out thoughts collide
Breaching the armour that cages the soul
Where secrets can no longer hide
