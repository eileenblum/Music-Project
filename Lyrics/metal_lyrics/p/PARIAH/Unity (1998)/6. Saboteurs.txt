It beats me how you sleep at night yet still ignore
The child that's dying at your door
Your country's on it's knees
Starvation runs amok
Yet still you concentrate on war

Seen through my eyes, I must despise
Your non-conscience, your disregard for life

You're saboteurs
You think you're saviours
Mindless saboteurs
Madmen saboteurs

Throughout so many years of conflict
What have you bred except unhappiness and pain?
Exporting your own brand of terror to us all
All for one and death to all

Seen through my eyes, I must despise
Your non-conscience, your disregard for life

You're saboteurs
You think you're saviours
Mindless saboteurs
Madmen saboteurs
