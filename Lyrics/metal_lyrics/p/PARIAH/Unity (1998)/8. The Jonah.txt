Blinding vision in my mind's eye
I dream a perfect world where nobody dies
Where tragedy and calamity don't plague me
No hurricanes devastate my skies

All I touch turns to dust
Know me at your own risk
But don't get too close
What am I? (I breed disaster)
Who am I?
So recognize that you're in danger
The jonah in me will snatch
You life away stay away

Bequeathed this trait down through untold lifetimes
A chaperone that's smothered me from birth
No family, no confidantes, no love to speak of
All have fallen prey to this wretched curse

My time spent in cold isolation
This warning obscures no deception
Can you tell me
What am I?
I breed disaster
Who am I?
So recognize that you're in danger
The jonah in me will snatch your life away

Incurring wrath at my mixed emotions
Disconsolate at living out this lie
I yearn to lead a life of inconsequence
But reality makes me kiss this life goodbye
