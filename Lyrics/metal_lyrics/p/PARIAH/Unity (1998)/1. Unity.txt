There was a time when we could not rely
On detente to remain intact
Now looking back it all seems so absurd
The balance, counter threats instead of words

If we could've seen the future to be
Thirty years ago
Yesterday's dreams are today's reality

One small step for a man
One giant leap for mankind
A step towards new frontiers
Leaving the cold war behind

You say you don't believe this unity will last
Nobody said it would be perfect
Co-operate, initiate a new world police
To crush any single threat to peace

If we could've seen the future to be
Thirty years ago
Yesterday's dreams are today's reality

One small step for a man
One giant leap for mankind
A step towards new frontiers
Leaving the cold war behind
