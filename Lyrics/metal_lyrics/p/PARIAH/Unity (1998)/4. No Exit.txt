In aid of peace and restoration
Calling on help from afar
Resumption of a noble deed
We've seen before
No matter how much or how often
No matter who it's for
You can take it guaranteed
They'll be back for more

It's cynical
Someone's always cap in hand
Wouldn't want you to misunderstand

No way out, of the annual fast
No way out, how long can the reasons
And excuses last

A plea for help and for salvation
Has now become demand
So once again the world combines
Provides the cash in hand
Your head appears above the water
Left alone with warnings you never heard

No way out, of the annual fast
No way out
Looking back to the time when it first came to light
An insight of what was to be
Now it appears all that toil was in vain
It's in your hands
We'll leave it up to you
Where do we go from here?
