I know your kind
You oppose everything and everyone
You love to sit and criticize
Arm chair bravado, easier said than done

Not happy unless you're unhappy
You play the martyr game
You ain't got nothing
So we should have nothing
Your only pleasure is in someone else's pain

So the world owes you a living
While you sit back and dream
Of success you envy in others
You won't lift a finger
You're so reactionary
So reactionary

I know your kind
You resent authority
Argue til you're blue in the face
Won't let others state their case
(you talk)

You talk but you never listen
And then you wonder why people don't
See things the way that you do
But then, everyone's wrong and you're right

So the world owes you a living
While you sit back and dream
Of success you envy in others
You won't lift a finger
You're so reactionary
So reactionary
