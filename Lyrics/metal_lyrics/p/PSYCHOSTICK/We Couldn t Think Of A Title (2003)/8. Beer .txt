I like beer 'cos it is good
I drink beer because I should
If there is a song to sing
I sing it and beer you bring
I drink beer when I am sad
'Cuz the beer it makes me glad
Now there's nothing left to say
So let's go drink beer

Beer is good
Beer is good
Beer is good
... and Stuff

Beer is good

Let's go drink some BEER

BEER

When it's warm it taste's real crappy
But cold beer will make me happy
When I throw up on the floor
I can go and drink some more
They say beer will make me dumb
It are go good with pizza
Now that we have drunk some beer
Lets go drive a car

Beer is good
