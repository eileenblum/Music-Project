I'm depressed
So I wrote this song
To express
Everything that's wrong

Like my mother
Wouldn't let me go to a rated R
Cool movie
At the theater with my friends

And I know
That you may not think that it's a big deal
But you don't understand.
You would never understand.
You could never understand.
You will never understand.

Cuz I'm singing this melody
And I don't know the words
And my life's just so pitiful(and will always be)
Like one big, smelly turd

I'm so fat
And I'm ugly
And I'm dumb
And I boring

I'm a loser and that's all that I'm ever gonna be
No use trying; I could never get anywhere

And I know
That you may not think that it's a big deal
But you don't understand.
You would never understand.
You could never understand.
You will never ever, never ever, never understand.

Cuz I'm singing this melody
And I don't know the words
And my life's just so pitiful(and will always be)
Like one big, smelly turd

Die, die, BITCH, DIE!
(and stuff.)
Die, die, SLUT, DIE!
(At random.)
Die, die, WHORE, DIE!
(Who farted?)
Die, die, French FRY!
(I'm hungry.)

Ooh you would never understand,
No, you would never understand

Cuz I'm singing this melody
And I don't know the words
And my life's just so pitiful (and will always be)
Like one big, smelly turd

You would never understand!
You would never understand!
You would never understand!
You would never understand!
You would never understand!
You would never understand!
You would never understand!
You would NEVER!, UNDERSTAND!
