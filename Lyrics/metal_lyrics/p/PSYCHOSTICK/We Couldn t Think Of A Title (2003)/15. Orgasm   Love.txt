I can feel you in my heart
Even though we drift apart
With those words you spoke to me
Though I always disagree

And I listen
To the sound of
Your sweet voice cause you won't shut up.

Now I'm finished
Let me call you
A taxi.

(woah o yeah, woah oh)

[Chorus]
I don't feel
That I'm feeling
Your feelings,

About these feelings that you feel
(woah romance)

And you know that I love you
when were FUCKIN'
Cause orgasm equals love.

All my friends smile and they chuckle
At pictures of your bear moose knuckle.
Please don't feel like you're a slut
When I'm peeing in your butt.

And I love to donkey punch you
After I poop on your sheets.
And I do it cause you love me,
And I love you (awwww)

(woah oh yeah, woah some more)

I don't feel
That I'm feeling
Your feelings,

About these feelings that you feel
(woa hack weeze)

And I love you
When you show me
Your sweet boobies
Cause orgasm equals love

I don't feel
That I'm feeling
Your feelings,

About these feelings that you feel
Lets get married
And have babies
Just kidding

Cause orgasm equals love,
Cause erections equals love,
Cause ejaculation equals love,
Cause deep throating blowjobs equal love,
Cause salad tossing equals love,
Double penetration equals love,
Anal kidney punching equals love,
Cause dirty sanchez's equal love,
Cause Cleveland steamers equal love,
Cause tying you up to my bed
And gagging you with your own panties
And sticking my wiener in between your boobies
And cumming all over your chin equals love.
