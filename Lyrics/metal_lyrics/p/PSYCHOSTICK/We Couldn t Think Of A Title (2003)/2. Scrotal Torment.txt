In a crowd
With no escape
is when I feel
My privates wake!

Got to find
some privacy
or they will see
me scratching me!

[Pre-Chorus]
My balls itch!
They're itching, I gotta scratch 'em
Way down low!
My balls are a ball of fire
My balls itch!
They're itching, I gotta scratch 'em
Way down low!
My balls are a ball of fire

[Chorus]
Irritation
Toleration
Scrotum itching
Leaves me bitching
Can't endure this
Epidermis
Scrotum itching
Leave me buh...

Tension builds
There's got to be
a way to end
my agony
pockets deep
where no one sees
I find the keys
to my relief!

My balls itch!
They're itching, I gotta scratch 'em
Way down low!
My balls are a ball of fire
My balls itch!
They're itching, I gotta scratch 'em
Way down low!
My balls are a ball of fire

Irritation
Toleration
Scrotum itching
Leaves me bitching
Can't endure this
Epidermis
Scrotum itching
Leave me buh...
