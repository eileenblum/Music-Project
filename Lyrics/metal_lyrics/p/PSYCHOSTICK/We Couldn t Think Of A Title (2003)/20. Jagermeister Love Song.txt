I know I promised I'd write you a love song
But instead I just wrote you a drunk song
Because love is pathetic
But seventy proof is no less than poetic

You look your best when my vision is blurry
That's not what I meant I can't keep from slurring
Because love is emetic
But not if you bought me a shot and I hit it

Drink 'till you're crazy
Dance 'till you're sick
Take off your bra
Give it to the 'stick

Drink 'till you're crazy
Dance 'till you're sick
Acknowledge the dumb
Give in to the 'stick

I can't see, now I have to pee
And I can't count to three
But I can count to JAGERMEISTER!

YEAH!

Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug my Jagermeister!

Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug my Jagermeister!

Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug my JAGERMEISTER!!!

WHEW!

Drink 'till you're crazy
Dance 'till you're sick
Take off your bra
Give it to the 'stick

Drink 'till you're crazy
Dance 'till you're sick
Acknowledge the dumb
Give in to the 'stick
