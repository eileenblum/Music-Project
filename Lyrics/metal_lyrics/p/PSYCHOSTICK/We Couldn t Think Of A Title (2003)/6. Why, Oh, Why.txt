I'm looking at you
It's all over
I don't feel quite the same
That look in the eyes
That you don't want me anymore
Even through you are too blame

Why Oh Why
Did this had to happen?
Why do you do me this way

(Tell me why) You had to lead me on so long
(Tell me why) I had to end it all in song
(Tell me why) You ran away with my best friend
(Tell me why) I still love you

I came across an old letter
Here what you had to say:
Would you please pick up a gallon of milk while your shopping at the store...
Wha?.....thats not it
There it is..you said....

I love you so
Your everything to me
I can love no other one
Yeah Right!

Except for maybe like I said:
My best friend
And my brother
And my dad,
And my younger brother,
And his best friend,
And that guys brother as well,
And that one guy that came over....

(Tell me why) You slept with everyone but me
(Tell me why) I'm out of words that rhyme with "me"
(Tell me why) You still owe three bucks for that milk
(Tell me why) I still love you

(Why?) did you leave me alone
(Why?) in the cold in the darkness
(Why?) so I can talk to the wall in the basement (Hey, who turned out the lights?)
Did you hurt me so bad
Did you feel no remorse?
(Why?) when you broke all of my shit with a crowbar?(Ow, my pinball)

Tell me why [8x]

I still love you [2x] (even through your a bitch)
I still love you [2x] (even through your a psycho
I still love you [2x] (even through you should DIE!)
I still love you [2x]
