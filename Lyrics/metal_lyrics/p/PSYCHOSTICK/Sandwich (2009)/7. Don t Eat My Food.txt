All day i was working
A shitty job with shitty pay
My only motivation was leftovers
From yesterday

I go home and find that
My lasagna is all gone
Your the only culprit
Now the line must be drawn

I hate you, You ate my food
I hate you, You killed my mood
I hate you, That was so rude
I hate you, Don't eat my Food!!!

Those are my taquitos
Those cupcakes belong to me
Don't you fucking eat them
Or death will find you in your sleep

That's my frozen pizza
Those are my burritos too
Don't you fucking touch them
Or you'll be eating through a tube

I hate you, You ate my food
I hate you, You killed my mood
I hate you, That was so rude
I hate you, You ate my food
I hate you, You killed my mood
I hate you, That was so rude
How would you like it if I ate all your shit?

You get what you payed for, I have no food
You get what you payed for, You ate my food
You get what you payed for, I get repaid
You get what you payed for, By eating you!!!

(Dude chill it was just a burrito)
DON'T!
EAT!
MY!
FOOD!
