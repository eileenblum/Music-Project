I wish I had a taco
With plenty of hot sauce
But all that I've got is a
Box of crackers

I wish I had a pizza
With mushrooms and sausage
But all that I've got is a
Jar of mayonnaise.

The fridge is so empty!
Good food is so tempting!
I've got three more days
till I get paid!

Take away my suffering
I can't go on with things this way
There's only so much that I can take
of eating ramen noodles.

I wish I had a waffle all yummy and covered with syrup and butter and
fresh strawberries

I wish I had an omlette,
the kind that you stop just to get at IHOP with some
hashbrowns and coffee.

The fridge is so empty!
Good food is so tempting!
I've got two more days
till I get paid!

Take away my suffering
I can't go on with things this way.
There's only so much that I can take
of eating dry Cheerios

(Okay there's gotta be something to eat here. Let's see. A bag of spaghetti, no tomato sauce.
A box of taco shells, no ground beef.
A box of baking soda. I cannot eat that.
Or can I?)

SPOT ME FOR LUNCH!
SPOT ME FOR LUNCH!
SPOT ME FOR LUNCH! I'll pay you back on Friday!
SPOT ME FOR LUNCH!
SPOT ME FOR LUNCH!
SPOT ME FOR LUNCH! I'll pay you back real soon!

I wish I had some ice cream
with plenty of chocolate syrup on top of it
maybe whipped cream.

Oh, man that sounds so good right now.
