For all you out there
Who are dirty and weary
For all those out there
Smelling stinky and sour
For all you out there
Who are in need of cleansing
I hope you're prepared
'Cause it's time... to shower

Take off your clothes
Pick up the soap
Get in the tub
Turn on the water and check on the temperature
CURTAIN FACADE!
Pull on the knob
Water on face
This is the place to be
Time to get nice and clean
SHOWER!

[CHORUS]
Water washes all of the parts
Of you in need of a good washing
Killing bacteria buildup on your body
Leaving you feeling great
Increasing your odds that night of getting laid
When you're getting your scrub on
You can practice on your singing
Having a blast the water
That you're flinging
Making your fingers wrinkled
If you stay in too long

The water's warm and so inviting
And it's cold outside
I want to stay in here forever
Where the steam doth rise

SHOWER! Better wash behind your ears
SHOWER! Better get between your toes
SHOWER! Don't forget your belly button
IT'S SHOWER TIME YOU BITCHES!
SHOWER! Do your best to get your back
SHOWER! Let the soap run down your crack
SHOWER! Private parts need your attention
IT'S SHOWER TIME YOU BITCHES!

Get everywhere
Shampoo your hair
Rinse it all out
Cleaning is done today
Time to procrastinate
STAY IN THE SHOWER!
Another half hour
Hot water hog
Pounding on door beings
Time for the fun to end
SHOWER!

[CHORUS]

SCRUB! [x15]

[pounding on door] Hey! Hurry up in there! I've gotta go number two!
