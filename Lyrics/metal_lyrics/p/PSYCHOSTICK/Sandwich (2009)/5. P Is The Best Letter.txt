P is the best letter in the whole alphabet,
because it starts the name of the greatest band ever.
The greatest band ever happens to be the one you are now listening to.

We're the greatest band ever.
GOD WE FUCKIN' RULE!

We should have like, 12 solid gold tour buses, each with a warp drive so we can tour the universe, and yachts made out of the bones of endangered species. Oh, we should have our band name carved into the moon, so that fans can always see our band name, and we should have guarddogs made out of diamonds to protect our ruby-encrusted palaces!

R is the second best letter of those mentioned,
because it starts the name of the best singer ever.
The greatest singer ever happens to be the one you are now listening to.

I'm your favorite singer, ever.
GOD I FUCKIN' RULE!

You see, I'm not just an average guy, I'm the singer from Psychostick! I shouldn't just have one chick, I should have a whole harem, and I shouldn't just have one harem, I should have 2, in every state! And each chick should be able to fly to Starbucks to get my mocha frappucino, and my chicks have Wi-Fi preinstalled!  Really fast Wi-Fi!

J is a better letter than the ones that you've heard,
because it starts the names of the guys playing stringed instruments.
We are the ones that destroy your faces off, because we break it down.

Feel it...

Just kidding!

[Alex:] "Hey, let's do A.  A is a good letter too, right?"

P-S-Y-C-H-O-S-T-I-C-K
P-S-Y-C-H-O-S-T-I-C-K

That's how you spell our name, get it fuckin' right, or we'll burn down your club.
