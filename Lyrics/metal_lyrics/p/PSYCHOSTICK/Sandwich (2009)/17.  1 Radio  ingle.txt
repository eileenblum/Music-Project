Woah, yeah...
Woah-oh...
Woah yeah, oh woah yeah...
Woah, yeah...

Well this is the part of the song
Where I talk about emotions
And this is the part of the song
Where I sing about how I feel so cold inside

And this is where my producer told me
To say "Yeah"

This chorus is so freakin' catchy
You will never be able to get this song
Out of your head
Out of your he-ead!
For the rest of your life

Well this little verse sounded
Just like the verse you heard before
Yeah!
But if you please take note
That the lyrics are slightly different than last time

We're killin' time
Until we're at the chorus
Again

This chorus is so freakin' catchy
You will never be able to get this song
Out of your head
Out of your he-ead!
For the rest of your life

Love every night
Love every day-yah!
Love is everywhere
And it's here to stay-yah!
I will be with you
You will be with me
For all eternity

Let's sell a million albums!

Ooh!
Yeah!
Rock!

This pretty bridge has no distortion
(Drum fill!)

And here we are back at the chorus
Don't you remember the one that is
So freakin' catchy it's stuck... In your head
For the rest of your life

And once again repeat the chorus
For dramatic effect to remind you
That it will be stuck... In your head
For the rest of your life
