I've been stuck
At this stupid job for far too long
And I just don't know
How much more of it I can take before I lose it

How can people that you see every day
Turn so evil when they come in and pay?
For a burger and some fries then they yell
I swear I must be in a living..

May I help you?

Tell me how you're doing on this very lovely day
Would you like to try a double bacon burger with a shake?
I can fake a smile of a kind that you've never seen
'Cause my manager is a bigger douche than you could ever be

Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do

That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other

That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other

I don't think
That I can take another day
But I have to pay
The rent or I am gonna get evicted

I don't wanna go to work but I must
Might as pay, turn away in disgust
Deal with people that just like to complain
Their sane is dead, they long to dish out..

Let me get the manager.

Tell me what's the problem, is there something I can do?
Do you have yourself a boggle here that I can help you through?
I am very sorry that we got your order wrong
If you give me just a second I can fix it in a jiffy

Moron

Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do

That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other

That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other

(Aaahhhh)

That's when they come
And they come and they come
And then they come and they come
Then one after the other

(AAAAAAHHHH)

That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other

One right after the other

And here comes another

Oh, heh, how considerate of you to come in and order five minutes before we close.
We already shut everything down, and cleaned it all up
But we'll go right ahead and fire those grills back up, just for you, champ.

No, no, it's cool.
I don't even wanna go home.
Especially not after a twelve hour shift with no lunch break
My reason for living is to serve YOU.

You know why?
Because the customers always right, right?
The customers always right.

I'll kill you!
I'll kill all you!
Hey? Where you going?
You forgot your fries!

You know what? I quit.
