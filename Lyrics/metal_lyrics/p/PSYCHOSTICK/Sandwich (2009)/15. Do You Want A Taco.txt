Do you find that every thought you haves about it?
Do you wake every second your without it?
Do you feel like your very souls on fire?
A burning desire!

Do you hate anyone that keeps you from it?
Would you do what it did until you got it?
Would you slay a thousand zombies?
And then you run and get one!

Do you feel inner peace because you hold it?
Would you fall in despair if you had dropped it?
Does it meet every need you have inside?
You feel so alive!

Do you crave all the simple pleasures of it?
Does the taste qualify in it?
Can you claim that the taste is to know the mind of God?

What can I get you?
I would like 4,000 tacos and 1 diet coke
How many tacos?

Four THOUSAND tacos and 1 diet coke?

Do you consume it or does it consume
Does it consume YOU?
Do you consume it or does it consume
Do you consume it or does it consume
Does it consume?
