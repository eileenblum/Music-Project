In a world where danger's everywhere.
Where the only currency is fear
Only one band can save us
Pyschostick
(you're a band!)
But now...
(No! Alex! Avenge me!)
They took their drummer
(No one kills my drummer but me!)
They took their revenge
(They're getting away with our revenge!)
But they forgot about...
Their vengeance!
Coming in about eight seconds
Psychostick is...
Revenge of the Vengeance.
