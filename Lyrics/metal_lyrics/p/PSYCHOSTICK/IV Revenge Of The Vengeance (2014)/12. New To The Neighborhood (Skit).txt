And now Bill Manspeaker of Green JellÃ¿ gets a visit from his new neighbors.

"I can't wait to meet our new neighbors"
"I'm sure they're delightful."
[doorbell rings]
"Hey!"
"Hi, we're your new neighbors."
"I gotta joke for you, alright?"
"Sure."
"Knock knock"
"Who's there?"
"Fucking get out of my fucking house you fuck!"
"Hey, we just came over here to introduce ourselves."
"Probably because you're a fucking moron!"
"We don't need to take this abuse!"
"I got another one for you,
Why'd the chicken cross the road?"
"Listen sir!"
"Get the fuck outta here!"
"You can't talk to her like that."
"He's taking his clothes off!"
"Ahhh, look out, here comes Snakey!"
"Oh my god, let's get outta here. "
"That guy's crazy"
"I'll fuck a dog but I won't fuck my cousin!"
"I think we should move."
"You piece of fucking shit."
