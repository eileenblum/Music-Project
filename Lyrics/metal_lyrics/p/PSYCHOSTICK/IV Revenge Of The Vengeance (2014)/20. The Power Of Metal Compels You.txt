Slap and pop to make them panties drop
Guitar slides to slip 'em down the thighs
Drum fills gonna make you squeal!
Brutal screams gonna make you....scream!
We release the power of brutal breakdowns

The power of metal compels you
To return to your place of origin
Or the nearest parallel dimension now
"Look, it's working!"
Go back to the hell from whence you came

"They did it!" "I wanna have sex again."
"Yeahhhh, we did it."
"Good work fellas."
"Hey, you know what? This calls for VICTORY BREAKDOWN"

"Pyschostork has done it, they've closed the rift with the power of their music. Way to go guys."
"We did it! We saved the world. This is gonna be great for our careers."
[Sirens wail]
"What is that?
[bombs dropping]
[explosion]
