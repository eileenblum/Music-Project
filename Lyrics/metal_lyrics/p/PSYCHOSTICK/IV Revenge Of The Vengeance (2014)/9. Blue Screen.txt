I can't believe it went down this way
I had so much left to save
I thought that we would last forever
But now I'm taking it day by day

Oh, what I'd give to have you again
But there's no way I can get in
You shut me out of my whole world now
My heart is in the recycle bin

And I don't know why
Backups weren't on my mind
'Till the day my computer died
My hard drive fried and I cried
I was too careless, now it's repairless
I know that's not a word
But I don't give a f__less
And now that you won't load
Not even in safe mode
I gotta check E-MAIL ON MY PHONE!

I feel as blue as my screen
Your error message is true
You formatted my heart
And partitioned it in two

I'm trying so hard to be strong
To be a man who can take a fall
I guess I had to learn the hard way
The price of making you hold it all

Now fate has forced me to interact
With human beings who talk and laugh
I'm in a hell of social functions
Fresh air and sun have turned my heart black

And I know I tried, for the data you had inside
Disk Utilities couldn't find
Why my access was denied

Now it's all over, I'll never recover
The memories you stored
Must have been a bad sector
And now you're so empty
You boot up to nothing
And now I gotta look up stuff in books

I feel as blue as my screen
Your error message is true
You formatted my heart
And partitioned it in two

"Ah, come on. Really? REALLY? "

I saw you wouldn't get started
I tried running GParted
Through the night just to find you couldn't be revived
I had to lose all my shit to learn to
Never forget that you can never depend on just a single drive

The saves to my games and all my porn
I miss you, I miss you. (PORN!)
I'll heal with time, but for now, I miss you, miss you [repeats]

I feel as blue as my screen
Your error message is true
You formatted my heart
And partitioned it in two

I hit Control+Alt+Delete
I guess there's no other way
Now I'm formatting C colon
But you come up blank, come up blank...
