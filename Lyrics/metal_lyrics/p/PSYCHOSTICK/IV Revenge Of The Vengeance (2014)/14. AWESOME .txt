Monster trucks are fucking awesome
Running shit over, that's fuckin' awesome!
Mowing the lawn, that isn't awesome!
Monster trucks that mow the lawn,
Now THAT'D be awesome

All that shit that's fuckin' awesome,
Give it to me, give it to me
All that shit that isn't awesome, you can keep it!

Blow-jobs are fucking awesome!
Bubble wrap is sort of awesome!
Staplers, I guess they're awesome...
(Yeah, they can be awesome, right?)
Clipping shit together, that's productive!

All that shit that's fuckin' awesome,
Give it to me, give it to me
All that shit that's sort of awesome, I'm indifferent

Trampolines, direct deposit, fighter jets, and nachos
All AWE-SOME. AWE-SOME.
Acid rain and moldy cheese
And waiting in line at the DMV
All NOT AWESOME. NOT AWESOME.
Frozen pizza, Styrofoam, and clothes hangers
And soap, I could take it or leave it
Awesome things are awesome
And the things that aren't, are not
And that's the way of the land

That's just the way the world is, man
Burning alive is NOT awesome
But waking up to a puppy
That's CUTE and awesome!
Finding a dollar, that's pretty awesome!
Supplemental income YEAH
Now we're talking! WINDFALL!

I can't wait to spend my dollar...
What should I get? What should I get?
99 cent store, menu cheeseburger
All that stuff, that's fucking awesome
GIVE IT TO ME, GIVE IT TO ME
I'm totally serious
I'm not asking but I'm demanding
GIVE IT TO ME, GIVE IT TO ME
How'd you like it if I strapped you down
And pulled your fingernails out?
GIVE IT TO ME, GIVE IT TO ME
All you gotta do to end the pain
Is give me awesome stuff so
GIVE IT TO ME (please!) GIVE IT TO ME (I don't have any stuff)
Gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie

...Thanks.
