This song is so heavy
It makes you want to headbutt a mountain
This song is so heavy
It makes razor-blades taste like candy
This song is so heavy
It makes you want to punch a tornado
This song is so heavy
This chorus is nothing but growling

Ooooh aaah uuuuh!

You scream high, I scream low
Doesn't this sound fucking amazing?
Those vocals were so heavy
It makes your grandma have a baby
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Cookie cookie, want a cookie!
This song is so heavy
It's actually kind of exhausting

Ooooh aaah uuuuh!

I'm playing this rhythm with my right arm
While I'm flexing my bicep on the other arm
And then I give it a kiss because I love my guns
And I don't think you've had enough
Let's break it down!

A little bit softer now, a little less brutal now
A little bit softer now, a little bit lower gain
A little bit softer now, a little less brutal now
A little bit softer now, a little less in your face
A little bit louder now, a little more brutal now
A little bit louder now, a little bit higher gain
A little bit louder now, a little more brutal now
A little more louder now, a little more in your face

Double bass (in your face!)
Double bass (in your face!)
Jog in place (jog in place!)
Jog in place (jog in place!)
Teabag the stage
Teabag the stage
This song was so heavy
My eyes and eardums are now bleeding
It reached the point of nauseating
This song was so heavy
Somebody get me a barf bucket, please!
This song was so heavy
Dude, somebody get him a bucket before...
The End.
