[Lyrics: Key, Jimmy Grant]

One, two, five, four, me count so poor. (gonna count, gonna count, gonna count now)

One, I can count to one.
Two, I can count to two.
Three, I can count to three.
Four, I can't count no more.

One, what comes after one?
Two. What comes after two?
Three. What comes after three?
FOUR.

I can only count to four.

One, two, nine, ten.
Lost count again. (gonna, count, gonna count, gonna count now).

The numbers have all beaten you.
You never made it through middle school.
Your edu-ma-cation failed your mind.
Now the numbers have left your brain behind.

You can only count to four.
We can only count to four.
Math and numbers
Lots of numbers
