(I wanna get an iPhone.) [x2]

I wanna get an iPhone app
That will help me out with remembering names.
I wanna get an iPhone app
That will get me a job making video games.

I want it,
I need it,
Go make it.
I want it,
I need it,
Where is it?

I wanna have an app
That calls in sick for me.
I want an app
That gives me iPhone apps for free.

My brain should be connected directly,
Downloading books and learning stuff while I sleep.

I wanna get an iPhone app
That Bill could be a steak,
Make it medium rare.
I wanna get an iPhone app
That will brush my teeth
While it's combing my hair.

I want it,
I need it,
Go make it.
I want it,
I need it,
Where is it?

I want an app
That will call and bail me out of jail.
I want an app
That fill find and bring hot chicks to nail.

When will they make an application
That makes peace between neighboring nations
While it's ending world hunger
At the same time it's finding a cure for cancer?

[Spoken]
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get on it.
What do you mean it's impossible?
Nothing's impossible!
I think somebody needs a little work on their attitude.

Why can't I get an iPhone app
That will live my life for me?
Why can't I get an app
That grants me immortality?

I want an app that will let me update Facebook.
(There is! Oh...)
I want an app that will let me check my email.
(It comes with the phone...)
I want an app that will tell Josh he should go to Hell.
(Dude, not cool.)
I want an app that will finish out the song for me
'Cause I'm outta here!

[Spoken]
Okay...bye!
Jerk.
