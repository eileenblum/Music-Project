Hey, you dickhole,
She was flirting with me.
Hey, you fuckface,
I just bought her a drink.

Here you swoop in while I'm taking a leak,
Ruining the evening.
She was the one that you wanted, douchebag, right?

I can't figure out,
If you're an overprotective brother
Or a friend of a friend's or,
Or a dumbass, bitterass father.

I really don't have time for this,
And now you stand in my way,
I got a feeling that you're here,
That you're here to stay.

One two, fuck you!

You're a cockblock,
Ruining my game.
You're a cockblock,
Pathetic and lame.

Hey, you dumb bitch,
Can't you leave us alone?
What's your problem,
Can't you throw me a bone?

Staring at me like I'm Satan himself,
Trying to steal her soul.
Go get a drink and take a break from fun patrol.

I can't figure out
If you're an overprotective sister
A jealous best friend,
(Or a lesbian wanting to kiss her?)

I really don't have time for this,
And now you stand in my way,
Can't take a hint and take a hike,
So you're here to stay.

One two, fuck you!

You're a cockblock,
Ruining my game.
You're a cockblock,
Pathetic and lame.

You're a cockblock,
That's what you do.
You're a cockblock,
Obstructing the poon.

[x2]
Don't you have something better to do?
(Go away and die in human pain.)

Congratulations!
You're an asshole!
I hope you're happy,
'Cause you're an asshole!
You ruined the whole night!
You're an asshole!
Why don't you go eat shit and die?
You're an asshole!

Cockblock! [x2]
