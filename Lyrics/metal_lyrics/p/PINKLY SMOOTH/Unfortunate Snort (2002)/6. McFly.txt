Why is this happening to me?
I've been back in time
And feeling ties are much too strong,
and theres a wolf inside.

[Chorus]
And lately he's been shaking all night,
and I wonder how he could have let you die.
Hold on strong and behold from the life you leave behind.
This could be catastrophic mind pollution,
what you had was real to me, ooh yeah.

Why is this happening again?
I've been ostracized.
And I cant seem to calm you down
Im still your father child, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
And lately he's been shaking all night,
and I wonder how he could have let you die.
Hold on strong and behold from the life you leave behind.
This could be catastrophic mind pollution,
what you had was real to me, ooh yeah.

And oh not again,
this is not my memory,
taken from my friends.

And lately hes been shaking all night.
I wonder how he could have let you die
