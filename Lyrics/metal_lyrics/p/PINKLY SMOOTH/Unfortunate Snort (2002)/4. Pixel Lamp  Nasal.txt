Around!
Around!

Fuck!

Slash him!
Chop him up!
Killing more
Killing the poor

Slash him!
Chop him up!
Killing more
Killing the poor

Sick of this
MURDER!

Got to help, all of my friends
Slow death, a part of me can't wait to reach the end

Let's go!

Come on up and dance around inside
Finish tonight
Would you listen to me?

We need to be by your lovers someday
Don't you recognize my face?
I know you!
Yes we know you very well

Sick of waiting for one thing
And we're all sick of waiting for one thing

Come on and dance around and slide
And you don't even shrill
Oh this is murder

We need to be by your lovers someday
Don't you recognize my face?
I know you!
Yes we know you very well

Got to help, all of my friends
Slow death, a part of me can't wait to reach the end

Fuck, talk, stay!
Please stay motherfucker
We're all sick of waiting for one thing

And we're all sick of waiting for one thing
When everyone loves to be fine

But it's there chasing us
Walking back behind!
And we're all tired of straining for one day
When everyone loves to be fine
It's just one day behind
