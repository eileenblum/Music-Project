Deep inside of the mind of the damned
Lies a dark memory of a man
Once moved in sight
Swing on in light
Now in the darkness, spills black,
Spills the blood of life

And on and on my little one sleeps
I don't know happiness

Centuries loved
Lifetimes behind
Solitude, sanity slowly unwinds
Moves become thoughts
Thought become dream
If only in life I'd been it could've been

And on and on my little on sleeps
I don't know happiness

Falling, falling and falling and falling
Falling apart

Falling, falling and falling and falling

Six things wrong and six things right
So he holds himself from the town, even the light
The voyage holds cryptic thoughts of a terrible light
He would never tell

Spends a moment, as through pleasure
Rather, when he slaves away
And I can only blame forever
Kneeling on your knees for me!
I took you down and spit my blood out
(But when they freeze me I may scream)
Never leave never leave

Now he's just one simple step away
Now he's just one simple step away

We'll bathe in my blood tonight
Murals
(Don't know how long)
Yes, you will
See all my sins to life
Profit from pain

What do we do with him?
Shut him!
(I can't feel me!)
Tie him up!
(Oh my god!)
That's it boy
(Latch on!)
Come to me
(Fucking leech!)
He's my prey!
(You're not the fucking balmist!)
Stop the pleading
(Embalm me!)
Insert it!
(Tell me, I don't know where!)
Right here! Numb us of all!
(We already broke it's law!)
You are around
(Fuck!)

The power, and teachings,
A slave to, once you steal
(Want him opened)
Nothing
(Once you've got a taste)
We feel
(Of cold punch)
Can ever
(The more punch you need)
Be real
(I should give it up)

The power to be real
A slave to, once you steal
(Want him opened)
Nothing
(Once you've got a taste)
We feel
(Of cold punch)
Can ever
(The more punch you need)
Be real
(I should give it up!)
