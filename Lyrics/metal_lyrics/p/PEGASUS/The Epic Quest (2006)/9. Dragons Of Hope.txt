The sun is rising, a new day begins
In my heart I feel the emptiness
An unbearable pain, to live without my queen
I need a chance to get her free

Now you see that we're stronger than before
Cause we've found the dragons of hope
Together we fight against the dark
And we're friends till the end of all times

The moon is rising a new night begins
In every dream she is calling my name
As long as I'll be alone I'm too weak to rescue her
My only hope is that my brother will return

Now you see that we're stronger than before
Cause we've found the dragons of hope
Together we fight against the dark
And we're friends till the end of all times

At the dawn I cannot trust my eyes
A horde of dragons is coming with the end
From their mighty leader I can hear my brothers voice
He has felt my pain and returned from his quest

Now you see that we're stronger than before
Cause we've found the dragons of hope
Together we fight against the dark
And we're friends till the end of all times

Now you see that we're stronger than before
Cause we've found the dragons of hope
Together we fight against the dark
And we're friends till the end of all times
