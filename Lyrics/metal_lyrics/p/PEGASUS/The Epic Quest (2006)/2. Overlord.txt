Look at this man, there is no one like him
A wizard of krynn, with an iron will

Without fear he destroys the evil's slaves
His name is in everyone's thought

He carries a staff, with the power of light
And his mighty voice, he can conquer the gods

Without fear he destroys the evil's slaves
His name is in everyone's thought

He is the overlord
The mightiest sorcerer
He is the overlord
The master of all worlds

With stormwind, black fire
The circle of magic
Together, wherever
We're gonna stay with him

In his clear eyes, you can see that he knows
As long as evil exists, his fate will be war

Without fear he destroys the evil's slaves
His name is in everyone's thought

He is the overlord
The mightiest sorcerer
He is the overlord
The master of all worlds

With stormwind, black fire
The circle of magic
Together, wherever
We're gonna stay with him
