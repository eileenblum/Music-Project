Somewhere in krynn in the hall of the dark
Imprisoned in chains with pain in her eyes

The guardians of hell watch over her
Merciless slaves, no pity, no heart

Whenever he comes, the lord of the dark
She closes her eyes, suffers the pain

An insensible hand strokes over her face
A horrible night is waiting for her

After this pain she takes all her strength
To look in his face and begins to talk

I'm the Queen of the Elves I will never be yours
I belong to my friends so listen to me...
