We are back from hell with bloody hands
This final fight was a challenge so bloody and cruel
A lot of knights have lost their lives
We'll never forget what they did for our task

Together we stand united as friends
The fire in our hearts will always burn

It's the end of the quest but not of our tale
The adventure is still going on

It's time for a little break in the Inn of the Last Home
With wine and roast we celebrate our victory
Dwarves and elves also knights and sorcerers
You can see it in their eyes: relief, joy and life

Together we stand united as friends
The fire in our hearts will always burn

It's the end of the quest but not of our tale
The adventure is still going on

We enjoy the peace all day and night
Like an idyllic spring what a wonderful time
But the mask of death won't leave us here alone
A new demon will surely come and then it will start again

Together we stand united as friends
The fire in our hearts will always burn

It's the end of the quest but not of our tale
The adventure is still going on

Together we stand united as friends
The fire in our hearts will always burn

It's the end of the quest but not of our tale
The adventure is still going on

Together we stand united as friends
The fire in our hearts will always burn

It's the end of the quest but not of our tale
The adventure is still going on
