In a stormy night they start their long way
Thousands of warriors riding towards the day
Over their heads in the darkened sky
Fly their dragon guardians hope for tomorrow gone by

Time to march, time to fight
No escape for the evil might

He leads this final fight
The Dungeon Master
Against the evil force
The Dungeon Master
With mighty spells of force
The Dungeon Master
To save the world tonight
The Dungeon Master

A night filled of fear, expectations and hope
You can smell the hordes, you can smell the smoke
Swords being sharpened, plans to be drawn
The battle is near in the early dawn

Time to march, time to fight
No escape for the evil might

He leads this final fight
The Dungeon Master
Against the evil force
The Dungeon Master
With mighty spells of force
The Dungeon Master
To save the world tonight
The Dungeon Master

The creatures of evil darken the horizon
The horror approaches, lead by worms, orks and iron
Blood is being shed like fire being spread
By dragons of hope that win over the dead

Time to march, time to fight
No escape for the evil might

He leads this final fight
The Dungeon Master
Against the evil force
The Dungeon Master
With mighty spells of force
The Dungeon Master
To save the world tonight
The Dungeon Master

The Dungeonmaster's spell has lightened the sky
The evil ones flee those who are still alive
The battle is won over dark, hell and the night
Peace is regained after a cruel fight
