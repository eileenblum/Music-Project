Iâm starting a new quest
because my knowledge is not enough
I must leave you here alone
but I surely will return

itâs only for a year
Iâll be waiting here for you
you are always in my heart
and Iâll love you for all time

my brother is informed
heâll keep an eye on you
his heart is strong and pure
and his sword will protect you

with him I have no fear
but it doesnât comfort me
my heart belongs to you
for you Iâll save my tears

...donât take this farewell so hard [2x]

when the evil will awake
donât make a fatal mistake
you canât defeat them all
send me a sign to come

Iâll reach you everywhere
my heart will find the way
but now itâs time to go
For the last time I feel you

...donât take this farewell so hard [2x]
