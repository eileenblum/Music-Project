A mighty warrior and the twin brother
Of Raistlin the legendary wizard
Long black hair, a giant sword
And the power of two horses

Without fear and a heart of steel

His mind is clear his will so strong
There is no challenge that he can't master
Everytime and everywhere
He is ready for his next battle

For justice and law a paladins oath
For freedom and peace he'll fight
Support all the weak and rescue the lost
His duty to fulfil his task

His heart belongs to his wife
She is the one who gives him power
And he knows she will be lost
If he fails this dangerous mission

For justice and law a paladins oath
For freedom and peace he'll fight
Support all the weak and rescue the lost
His duty to fulfil his task
