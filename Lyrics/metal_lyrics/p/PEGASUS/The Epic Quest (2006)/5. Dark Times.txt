My name is hate, I'm the lord of hell
Now it's time to pay the price for Lord Soth's death
In the depth of the night a dark figure has arrived
He desires a new princess to take revenge on me

His eyes glow red and with a breath of ice
He requires his tribute to spread new pain
He enslaves the Queen of Elves, my brothers wife
And with a scornfull laughter he strides away

A new pain has overrun our land
We have failed but this is not the end
There is always hope in our hearts
So stand up and fight against the dark

Together we're strong and we will strike back
There is only one aim that the dark times will end

With his hordes he left our peaceful land
From afar we can hear his evil voice
I have won, I've got my new princess
She will be my slave for the rest of her life

A new pain has overrun our land
We have failed but this is not the end
There is always hope in our hearts
So stand up and fight against the dark

Together we're strong and we will strike back
There is only one aim that the dark times will end
