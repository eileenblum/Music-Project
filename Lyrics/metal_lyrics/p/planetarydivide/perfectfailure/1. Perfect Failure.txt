Perfectly manufactured
Time slowly passes through the substrate
It boils down to nothing
This universal conundrum
Will never have its answers revealed

Step outside and take on the lunar energies presented to us all
The midnight air refreshes your soul for the journey you've been eluding
The poison you hold in your mouth opens the gates
And it begins to spill
A flood of suppressed emotions, neglected but never forgotten

Time is a constant we wish we could avoid
Breathe in the last shred of humanity
Stop what you're doing
And leave your body behind
Venture forth into habitual fantasy

We are not alone
Not alone

Spreading lies to raise the quality of our own lives
With clarity aside, we're denying the signs
A claim to sobriety will end this new found existence
But can you really go back to this perfect failure?

Perfectly manufactured
Time slowly passes through the substrate
It boils down to nothing
This universal conundrum
Will never have its answers revealed

The poison you hold in your mouth opens the gates
And it begins to spill
A flood of suppressed emotions, neglected but never forgotten
