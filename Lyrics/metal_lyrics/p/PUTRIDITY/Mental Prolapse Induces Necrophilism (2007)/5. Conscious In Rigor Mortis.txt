Dead but you can feel my knife slicing your skin
I denied your eternal rest
I'm trying to cut your breasts but my hacksaw has broken against your body
Fucken rigor mortis
Feces flood out

Feed you with your excrements
And my semen I keep you undead
Rigid corpse doesn't bleed

Snatch your legs then your pussy lips

Disembowel
Feast or rape dual abuse on your body somehow you'll feel
I'm entangled in your gory cavity but I
Go on with your necrotomy
You're in infinite suffering
I see in your conscious terrorized eyes

No one can hear your laments
Rigor mortis
Broke your peace
Thoughts of eternal suffering
Festering out of your head
As I try to dissect
Your decayed organs
