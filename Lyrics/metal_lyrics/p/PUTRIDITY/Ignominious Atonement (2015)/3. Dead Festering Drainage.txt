Prominent epicarnal veins are the macabre labyrinth
Subtly devise by an insane demiurge
Beneath tense and thin membrane
Festering fluid flourishes

His bregma is streched and doesn't pulse
Protrunding frontal bones

Days marked by the abnormal growth of head circumference

Weird congenite phocomelia

Emphasizes knees anomalies
Wich suddendly ends in tiny deformed feet
Palmate hand are waving behind elbows

Macabre deviation of eyeballs
Transbregmatic ecographia
Brain tomography shows bunches of arachnoid cysts
Emispheres are small and there's no cerebral worm
In this hideous and degenerated version of human being

After inducing sleep
The head is completely shaved and latter wrapped in a sterile blanket
The peritoneal chateter is being inserted with strength
Into a jellish fat layer

Cranium trephining violates the dura mater
Expert hands dip into viscid pool
Tiny tube inserted with methodical precision
Between ventricles belinging to that submerged microcosm
