Dominating and mastering death
Manipulating suffering

Segregating an host into presumption
Ignorance chase after an illegal technically
Can take horror upon violence subjected childhood
It's a crime 
A murder

Murder against a pitiful lament

From ashes an anguished convalescence
New victim of overbearing opulence of demon's metamorphic skills

Begins to wonder despondently
During his days wounded by sorrow
Inhuman pain of a plain death rattle
It puts ignominy of purity

Bone sclupture comes out
From the shocking reunion of deviated flux of organic fluids
Youth modelled on crushed bones
Futile medical care brought by an abusive technicality

Martyrize a body already plagued by deformity
Drolls like rivers of ink
Flowing on the aware grimace

The enduring of this vain treatment
Leads birth to a rough deontology
That shapes social outcasts
It's a pointless martyr planned with cruelty

Hiding behind deceiving tears
Just to feed primordial immortality cravings
