Ignominious atonement

A rabid bad omen takes its form
Through the commitment of a sadistic abuse
An authentic evil spell
That aims at creating pain
Mother alienated by paroxystic form of overprotection
Delegates to doctors the dismemberment of her progeny

Ignominious atonement
Unfathomable exhibition
Of human foolishness
Ignominious atonement

Hasty omnipotence
Megalomania

A father gazes at vivisection
Of his intimate sexual intercourse

Ignominious atonement
Unfathomable exhibition
Of human foolishness
Ignominious atonement

The remodelling of a son
It's a sadistic ceremony supported by a nihilist science
Which is fatally over whelmed by all that is incurable
But tries to get back at what's treatable

A man observes mercilless vicious reality
Through a cataractic veil
In the jungle of mental illness
The eternal sentece to vegetate
Among the reject triumph

It's an abusive tecnicality
Intilled with infernal insight
Savagery that doesn't allow to independently commit suicide

Expiation
Ignominious atonement

Tears are now turning into scorching ink drops
Flowing on the disfigured face of a raving man
Who's now rottening standing

While the poison injection carried him to oblivion
He understood what they were feeling
And he didn't hate them

While the eternal rest was already crawling up to his guts
