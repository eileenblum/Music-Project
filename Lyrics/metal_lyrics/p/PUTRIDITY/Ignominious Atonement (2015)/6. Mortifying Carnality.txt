The time of disdain
Has done its will

I was destroyed and ruined
And it's devastated me
Even though it didn't finish me

I was left mutilated humiliated
I've been mocked in front of an impetuous virility

Scorn
Disgust alongside a cheerful youth
Those eyes filled with monumetal shame
Turned excitement in compassion

Violent and insatiable lust
Obsessed with sublimation of flesh
An opprobrious dark monstrosity
Turned perversion into pathology
While masturbating

Caressing genitals
I started squeezing out the juice
So ashame that I felt
As the first came out
I was buried in a rough display
Of subliminal existence

Intellectual vanity aroused by a chronic
Narcissistic neuropathy
