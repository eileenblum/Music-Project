Swinging changes of endocranial hypertensions
Mark out first week after surgery
Continous supervision of bregma
And cranial circumferences it's needed
Awakening binds him into a terrific agony

Even the smallest contraction
Mean as natural and desperate call for help
Is trapped by an infernal mechanism
Composed by pipes and gauze's ropes
Wich repress each movement
Even the smallest in order to aid the drainage of fluids

Sometimes men thinks they know how to chase evil away

The helplessness of a creature
Monstrous goatish mass
So fragile so innocent

Facing such a deep pain 
Make him feel alone
Hurt and scared

And where you're feeling scared and hurt for a long time
Fear and pain turn into hate
Under that mask full of frills
Wich where organized with care and methodical hypocrisy
Cruel tiranny of cosmic laws reigns supreme

A rare form of syndromic craniosynostosis
Discloses a fruit that smells like evil

Out of a white curtain
That's hanging to hide that awkward theatre
Stands a shape with grim and clovering features
Which ominous shadow is underlined by feeble half light
He's got triangular shape
The cheekbones are flat the palate is narrow
The forehead is high and towers above the face
Until it reaches the nose

The blasphemous king reigns with supreme composure
During that disparaging sabbath
