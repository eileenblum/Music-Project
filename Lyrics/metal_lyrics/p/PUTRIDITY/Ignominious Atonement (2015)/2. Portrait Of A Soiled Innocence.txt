A mad hustle of swine like things
Resound all along the impressive hospital tower
They're swollen by greyish sections that come out in spurts

Gurgling from the womb just been mangled unto hideous form
But the spotless couch will soon vanish and sow is roped
In a sickening humour bath
It clumsily wriggless

The air is foul the heat is unbearable
Frantic and thumping hoofs noise
Procession of white coats

A sudden rip
Universe emerges from the livid orifice abyss
In a smelly placenta bed
Hybrid poison necrotic love beyond good and evil
There's only the flesh and the pleasure it give us

In a smelly placenta bed
An enormous hydrocephalus mass flounders
In his guano-soaked purity 

Dismay rules petrified faces
Echos of agonizing wailings
Are coming out of a monstrous goatish cephalopathy
That clutter of stumps is a gross outrage of embriology

Consequence of bestial disturbance

Hybrid innate abnormality romantically
Know as love that induced
Cranial deformity
Fleshy mass induces lower limbs phocomelia

Defacing upper lip contorsion back bone distortion

Unnatural simmetry of eye sockets widely
Covered by malignant infestation
Tumoral excrescenses

In a smell placenta bed
An enormous phocomelicus mass flounders
In his guano-soaked purity
