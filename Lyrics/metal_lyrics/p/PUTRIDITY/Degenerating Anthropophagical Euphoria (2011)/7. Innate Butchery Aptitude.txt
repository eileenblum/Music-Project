Innate butchery aptitude 

Suffering my only need is for devouring
it make me sick
indulgence in bloody acts intoxicate me like a drug
I feel sick
primal instincts forced to occur
I can't control my own thoughts
I must please it
Murder is my infatuation 

So I need to purse my compulsions to kill
consuming fresh human meat

Tearing flesh with my bare hands derives pleasure 
wrenching chunks
Omophagic innate fucking depraved fervor for the carrion
I cannot command

Forbidden lust for gutting consumes my upset mind
remains and discarded with not go to waste for worms

I must get them to gorge 

I'm love with dead body
Raping still warm flesh of the recently deceased
sends myself in ecstasy 
Shredding in cannibalistic violence to sedate my mental obscene privation
