Sentenced to a motionless existence 
grieving on a comatose state endlessly 

Revolting and pathetic being without any perception
but my mind is still lucid
paralyzed languishing in complete atrophy
I have mouth but I cannot scream

Bodily covered with decubitus plagues 
abandoned to degrade 

Surrounded in disgust with insects and flies
they crawl on me
I can feel then, my wounds are pulsating
whole invade by grubs

Devouring from within
consumed rupturing innards
in bloated organ lacerations breeding

Limbs are crashing and releasing all the body fluids
gastric juices're erupting from my stomach
gastric juices're erupting!
I'm self-digesting from within
agonizing but still breathing I will wait my end

Wallowing in my grief
my last hope is to get killed rapidly

My mortal blow is so
so extremely close death is well accepted 
breaking up my pitable existence
