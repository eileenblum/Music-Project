My mistakes are on display
I am a living breathing example of the way things
Of the way things shouldn't be
I've watched my life play on repeat
Its cycles ever lasting
My insanity has been defined by my gullible reactions
To situations I have already known
I grow tired of this
How must I change this world I've built for myself

I used to believe in you, as you were my fresh start on a world I was dying to escape

Yet I allowed the cycle to continue
And my insanity has drove us apart
I will make this promise to myself
To better my perception
Better my perception, better my choices
Better my perception, better my choices

For these tattered hands are worn from the friction of the earth
Pushing myself back up each time I have failed to do the right thing
For these tattered hands are worn from the friction of the earth
I just wish I had another moment to change course

Awaken, awaken
Breathe deep
Reverse course

Believe for a moment I tell myself that there may be no tomorrow
Believe for a moment I tell myself that there may be no tomorrow
No chance to change what you have destroyed
No chance to change

For these tattered hands are worn from the friction of the earth
Pushing myself back up each time I have failed to do the right thing
For these tattered hands are worn from the friction of the earth
I just wish I had another moment to change course
