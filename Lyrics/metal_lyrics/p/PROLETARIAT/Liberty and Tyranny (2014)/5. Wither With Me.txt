Like the withering summer leaves in the autumn breeze I stand here clinging to life
Drained of motivation, devoid of all emotion
I have become a mere shadow of my self

We all lose our selves sometimes in the tiring days and dreary nights
We are left stuck searching for answers to questions we have created for ourselves

Regretful revelations dictate choices now
My hands have formed a callous from failing to grasp hold of the ones I've loved
Slipping through I've lost touch with you
I forgot to love you
Slipping through I've lost touch
I forgot to love you
Has this made me a better man
Having failed myself and those who put there trust in me

Like the withering summer leaf in the autumn breeze I stand here clinging to life
Drained of motivation, devoid of all emotion
I have become a mere shadow of myself

My misery is mine to keep and I won't let just anyone take that from me
I won't let you tell me how to feel
I've placed myself here and I will find my way
And I will find my way

I'll take these fractured pieces of what I call my life
I'll piece back together something stronger than before

And I will find my way
And I will find my way back to you
I'll find my way back to you if you would just wither with me
