Will you stand with me against all that is unjust
Protecting those who can not protect themselves
Will you be the sight for those who are blind
Guiding them to the light of all that is true

We must not allow the crimes of a ruling class
Define a culture set on liberty and justice
Will the world always look upon us as tyrants
Corruption runs deep as propaganda finds its way

Be vigilant in the face of such lies
Know the difference between liberty and tyranny

I will not be a slave

Be vigilant in the face of such lies
Know the difference between liberty and tyranny

Will you stand with me against all that is unjust
Protecting those who can not protect themselves
Will you be the sight for those who are blind
Those who are blind
