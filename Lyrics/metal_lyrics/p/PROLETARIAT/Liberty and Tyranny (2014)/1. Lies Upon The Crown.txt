Your words are unjust

Your words are unjust
Your actions cowardice
Spare me the lies of a serpents tongue
For it is poison to a sane man will
And I unlike those before you understand
I understand what is going on
I understand what is going on

Your words will not poison me
My stance shall be unwavering
