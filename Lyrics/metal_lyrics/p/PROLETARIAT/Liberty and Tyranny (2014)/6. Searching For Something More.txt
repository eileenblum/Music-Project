I will hide away burying myself in
My idea of the world
For reality and all it has offered
Has only lead me astray
It has destroyed me

Turning me against my better judgement
Leaving me alone
Must I rely on the image of such a deceitful place

I just want to be something more
I just want to be something more

In the ridges of my tattered fingers
And the creases of my tired palms lies
The history of my life
I've seen the path that I have chosen
And the road that has been set before me
I just want to change this all
I just want change

I can not allow myself to settle for selfish interactions
And regretful decisions, decisions

I just want to be something more
I just want to be something more

I will garner the strength to lift the pain from my back
No longer counting my scars while trying to find my blessings
