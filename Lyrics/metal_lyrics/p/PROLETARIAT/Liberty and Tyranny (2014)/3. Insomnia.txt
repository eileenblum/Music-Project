Dream for me for I can not find sleep
I can not find sleep
My eyes burning with anticipation, anticipation
Is this what you call insomnia
Insomnia

Or has my insanity over taken my dreams
What is the plot
Where is the punch line
Was there ever one when it came to madness
What is the plot
Where is the punch line
Was there ever one

I've lost my mind and I've lost my love, Insomnia
My body is ragged, I feel so weathered and so cold
My body is ragged, I feel so weathered and so cold

I've turned off the lights within my heart
And let the darkness soak in from my brain
Breathe in breathe out
Let the oxygen fill my collapsed lungs

Has my insanity over taken my dreams
What is the plot
Where is the punch line
Was there ever one

When it came to madness

I can't sleep I've been up for fucking days
I've dreamt of hell while staring straight at that wall
I'm dreaming while awake this is all a game
My hallucinations have become my friends
And we are all gathered here today

Waiting, yes, waiting on what comes next
Will my mind collapse
What is the plot
Where is the punch line
Was there ever one when it came to madness
This is insomnia devouring my dreams
