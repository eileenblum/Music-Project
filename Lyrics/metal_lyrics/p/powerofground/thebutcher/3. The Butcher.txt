Born in a Catholic family,
I've always surrendered myself
In the service of my lord.
To cleanse this world from evil.

A critic of social norm
At birth, I've created, my own ways
For His Holiness to prevail.
For evil to surrender itself.

Murder!

Severed penis from the rapist,
Hands n tongue from the abuser,
Head from the then minister,
Brain and body of the Satan worshiper.

Taking the severed body parts
Preserved in the pursuit of my dark virtues
I sew them
With the art of my murder
The ultimate offering!

Murder â perceived as evil in
The context of the social judgment,
Is the weapon in my moral paradox.
Assembling the most evil human parts to offer
The perfect sinner.

To my master in the heavens.

My sermon and chants are ready
To celebrate His Greatness.
The perfect sinner is ready for the offering,
The time I'd been waiting for the song to be chanted to the heavens.

May the lord of Holiness
Rise above all,
Hail my master,
Hail my father,
His glory.
May you accept my offering
To grant me salvation.
Amen
