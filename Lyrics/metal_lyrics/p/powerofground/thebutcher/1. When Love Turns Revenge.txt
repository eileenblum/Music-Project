I was a fool to think
This was a different love story,
The dimwit gazing the sky
Like some fascinating fairy-tale.

I knew I was a bloody spineless asshole,
But she was also a siren with her allure,
So there wasn't actually something I could've done,
Like Cleopatra, crafted with irresistible desire.

Not the game of childish love,
It's her art of seduction,
Ripping open layers of my wall,
Defenseless and desperate.
The only thing on my frigging mind
Was to fuck her like a beast (all the time).

I was played like a plastic toy with screw attaching different joints of my body,
Sex was the only bid that you played,
And played it with maddening grace,
You thought you were a courtesan as you were fuckin' rich,
But I opened my eyes to see nothing more than a cheap
Bangladeshi whore.

When love turns revenge,
I don't tame you in my hell,
When love turn revenge,
I don't feast on your body,
When love turn revenge,
I cage you in my hell,
When love turn revenge,
I let the maggots in my hell feast on you.
