Referred as "long pig",
Human's not bred for its meat.
Like animals raised for slaughter,
In a controlled environment.

Pickle
Soup
With hands
And feet.
Skin
Made
Into
Fried rinds.

Water for its feed to flush its system,
Purge the stored toxins and wastes.
No animal's allowed to age for thirty years.
But I picked this "ripe" Caucasian female
In twenties.

Pickle
Soup
With hands
And feet.
Skin
Made
Into fried rinds.

My butchers block's been waiting
For ritual of angel fire sacrifice

Dig my long-bladed knife deep,
Cut through the neck-larynx.
Sever internal external carotid arteries,
The major blood vessels.

I slice away the muscle and ligament
From the jawline
Twisting it off from the spinal chord
I flay the carcass get rid of the hair and
The tiny glands which produce sweat and oil.

And my angel bleeds fire!

Gutting!
Remove the arms!

Carried blood from the heart to the head, face, and brain
Allow for the blood to drain.
I boil the strips
And peel the layers,
Then cut into pieces
And fat fry in oil.

I am the butcher
Sent for the holiness
Serving for the gods and
The cannibal community
