The end,
Searching out from the grave
For in the surface to end this war
You are out talking to the whore,
Blood in her guts, in her face

Virgin rape them. Deliver to hell
Take the glass pour the greenish puke
And feed her as the last drink before
Remember the end,
The one has said
Corpse defaced, in the end,
Fucked and betrayed

Virgin in its extreme bluff work
Or just a failed promise to regret on
But there's no time for tears but for blood
And I thus urinate on your body
In thousand pieces
Conflagration has engulfed the everything

Feast for the beast!
Feast for the beast!
Feast for the beast!
Feast for the beast!

I release the beast of destruction
Feasting human extinction
I sentence you for a lifetime death
And put my fingers inside your womb

Cursed, go, fucker! Soon a seize will break again into you
And a big iron ball will crush the
Rib cage that holds
Your fucking heart,
And slay it like shaping a cake

Fuck you motherfucking whore die die die.
Fuck you motherfucking whore die die die.
Fuck you motherfucking whore die die die.
Fuck you motherfucking whore die die die.
