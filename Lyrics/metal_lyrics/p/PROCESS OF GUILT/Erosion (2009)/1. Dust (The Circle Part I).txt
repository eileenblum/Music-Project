Life's austerity, of failures that will come and fade.
(The harshness of) breathing a cycle's rebirth,
With no end nor beginning,
Like a circle of life and death.
(Achievements) made of light and misery,
Of joy and pain,
Of you and me.

And still the pain is always the same,
Like a circle of life and death.
Words like dust, dust like blood.
Dust like blood and blood like death.
Words like death, death like blood.
Your blood.

The blood is always the same,
Always mine, my blood.

An image's sterility, one moment without regret.
Carved in time, in myself.
(The harshness of) breathing,
A cycle's rebirth, with no end nor beginning,
Like a circle...
A dead circle.
