From where it all takes form and all returns.
Where all daemons breath and all die.
From where it all takes form and all returns.
Where daemons breath and they die.

Like lava (coming) from within, I spit my world.
Like lava (coming) form within I spit my world.
Lies come and grow, detracting the outside.
Like lava flowing from inside.

A circle of fire, lies and blood, burning inside.
Ruin comes from within.
