From silence to silence
Release
From pain to oblivion
Release
From silence to your silence
Release
From my defeat to your oblivion
Release
As you walk you burn
As you fade I disappear
From silence to silence
Your guilt is mine mine
A spirit to forget
To forget
Your burden to forgive
Forgive
Your silence dies in me
In me
From pain to oblivion
From my defeat to your oblivion
Release
Your burden
As you walk you burn
As you fade I disappear
Disappear
