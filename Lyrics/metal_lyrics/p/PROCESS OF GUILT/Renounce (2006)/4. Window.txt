Here I can witness
This image in your window
From here I can see
The collapsing colors of your empire
Draining my perception
In this instant of your grief
Closing my eyes
Fading out in my believe
Why can't I breathe?
Why should I even consider?
Am I a renounce?
Why can't I breathe?
Why should I even consider?
Am I a renounce?
Or maybe a faded image
From this window
I can reach you
Still I stood still in here
Drawing an end to your world
In a single smile
In this illusion of life
A symbol of pain
A symbol of my pain
