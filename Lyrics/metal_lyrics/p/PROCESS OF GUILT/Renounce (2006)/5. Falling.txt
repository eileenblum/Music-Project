Trying to see what makes this difference
From when I used to feel nothing
Trying to believe
In nothing
Attempting to leave
To disappear
When I tried to believe
In nothing
Attempting to leave
Trying to fall
Words flowing down
An attempt to regret
Something or someone
Not here
When I tried to believe
In nothing
Attempting to leave
To disappear
My fall, my fall
Burning these wings
I will fall
This time I fall
I will fall
My fall, my fall
Lying to someone
Watching my decline
This vision of someone
Of me burning
My fall, my fall
Deceiving my words
I will fall
This time I fall
I will fall
Lying to someone
Watching my decline
This vision of someone
Of me
Falling
