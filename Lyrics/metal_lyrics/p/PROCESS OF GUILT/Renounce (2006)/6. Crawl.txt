Crawl (and fade your reflection)
Crawl (and burn your resemblance)
Like a beast in my mind
Like a fragment of my pain
Crawl like a fragment of my pain
Crawl with your eyes
And burn your resemblance
To what I've felt
Crawl and burn
And cry for all you lived wanting
And hate for all you lived needing
Regret (and seek deep in you)
Deceive (and laugh of you)
Lay down on me
The lie that you became
Crawl like a fragment of my pain
Crawl with your eyes
And burn your resemblance
To what I've felt
Crawl and burn
Lay down on earth this placed you've earned
With your misery
Lay down me the lie that you've became
Now crumble
Crumble
Regretting shame
Regretting blame
And crumble for pain
And crawl for pain
Regret and crumble
Deceive crawl and crumble
