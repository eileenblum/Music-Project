Fragments
Death of time
One more day consuming devouring
Another moment
A refrained attempt to another defeat
Staring to this pale dead wall
Trembling dawn this shapeless existence
Staring to this pale dead wall
No angle no sight just a spark of light
Fragments of reason
Unable to complete this instant
Expressions of remorse
The death of time
A spiral of scenes
Crumbling out of reach
To the outburst grey
Grey
The death of time
A spiral of scenes
Crumbling out of reach
To the outburst grey
Fragments of reason
Unable to complete this instant
Expressions of remorse
