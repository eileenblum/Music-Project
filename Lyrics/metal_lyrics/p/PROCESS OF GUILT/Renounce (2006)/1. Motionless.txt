Decaying slow in one thought
The guidance of our need for an end
Decaying slow in one judgment
The growing pain of our need for a conclusion
The rising despair of our need for pain
Of your distress for life
Your intent for loss
End â your end is here
For I stay here
Descending here
With no motion
Static
Waiting for our end
Still
Tied
To yourself
Decaying slow in one thought
The closing pain of your remission
Of you playing me
The shameless indifference of your need for
Pain
Of your distress for life
Your intent for defeat
Defeat
