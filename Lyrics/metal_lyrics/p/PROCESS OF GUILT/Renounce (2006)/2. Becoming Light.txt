Rain falling down on me
The sound of darkness coming in my way
A grey paint of decay
So fragile so dark
Blurring my spirit
A grey paint of loss
So near so dark
Ending my will
An then light comes
Fading out my fall
Deceiving
My own lies
In distress
Emotions flow through a glimpse of light
Glowing deep under words
This syntax of illusion
At the dawning of myself
Where darkness becomes light
Where words evolve in echoes
Resonances of radiance
At the dawning of myself
Where darkness becomes light
Where words evolves in echoes
Resonances of radiance
Radiance
Where darkness becomes light
Wasted sounds
Drained visions
Lies of an end to come
Come
At the dawning of myself
Myself
Where darkness becomes light
Rain falling down on me
The sound of darkness coming in my way
A grey paint of decay
So fragile so dark
Blurring my spirit
A grey paint of loss
So near so dark
Ending my will
