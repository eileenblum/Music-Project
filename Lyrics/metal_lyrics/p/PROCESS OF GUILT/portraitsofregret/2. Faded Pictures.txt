Warm faded pictures
Returning again
Portraits of joy
Remembering who's gone now
Sleep
Dream
Escape

Images kept in mind
Somehow a divine sunset
Remembering me
Memories of yesterday
Caught us in time
Words just for nothing
A life, even a kiss
To remember
For the ones who died

Warm faded pictures
Returning again
Portraits of joy
Remembering who's gone now
Sleep
Dream
Escape
