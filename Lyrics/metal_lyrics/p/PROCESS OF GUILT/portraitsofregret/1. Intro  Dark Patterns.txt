Dark Patterns
Fulfilling this sight
Regrets, joy, beauty pain
Life death

Hey, you listen
Look at me once
What do you seek?
What do you live?

Always torn apart
By this lack of beauty
When you loose yourself in
What do you see?
What do you seek?

In the absence of life
Grey dark patterns fulfilling this sight
Do you feel?
Do you know life?
There's nothing to see anymore
Regrets joy beauty pain life death

Always torn apart by this lack of meaning
Where you loose yourself in
Where you drown yourself in
Did you feel?
Did you even know death?
