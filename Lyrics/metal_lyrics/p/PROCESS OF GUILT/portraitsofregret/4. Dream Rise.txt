Here where dreams once rise
Here you fall
Here where dreams once rise
Here you fall
And I can't look back

In grace you fall
A never-ending dream
Wicked you look
Your divinity you'll loose

No one to see
Anyone to stare
No one to see
Anyone to stare

A never-ending dream
Moving you upside down
Smiles, tears, wasted
Where's reality
Where's pain

No one to see
Anyone to stare
No one to see
Anyone to stare
