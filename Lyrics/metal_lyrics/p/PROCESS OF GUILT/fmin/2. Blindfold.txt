Try to stare
Try to reach
Try to hold
And strive

Try to stand
Try to feel
Try (not) to bleed
And persist

Try to keep
Try to care
Try to save
And ruin

Try to say
Try to hurt
Try to spit
And give it all

Is this the way?
It was intended (to be)?

Unfold your lies
Lies will step on you
Greed will take you down
Is it really there?

Lies
(They) will not save you
Is it really there?
