(To) Give up here
On a downward spiral

The scale of time
A bargain between beggars

The scale of time
A bargain between liars

When the fire ceases
When the hunger subsides
When the line forms
And ashes and colors burn
In this empty corner
In this filthy place
Nothing breeds
Nothing heals
Nothing ceases

The scale of being
The scale of pain
The scale of man

Your sacred barrier
FÃ¦min
