To bleed the sun
And burn the rye

To keep the seed
And stomp the land

To drain the soil
And fill it with ashes

To blur the sky
And deny the sun

To wait for rain
And cleanse the guilt

To burn the seed
And drain the soil

To wait for rain
And cleanse the guilt

To drown the seed
And flood the land

Blind
Harvest

(Here) Nothing grows
