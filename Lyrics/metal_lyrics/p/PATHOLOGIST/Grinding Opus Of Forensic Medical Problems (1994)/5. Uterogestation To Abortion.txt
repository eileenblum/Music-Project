[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Defilement of bosomy virgin
Sensual hymen is deflorated
Erected phallus inside pussy
Puking disgust of copulation

Jism on genitals
Menstrual blood
Embryo resorbence

Ovulation by sexual abuse
Clotted uteral mucus
Fertilization of ovulum
Gelatinous mucin from abrasion

Abnormal umbilicus
Asphyxia of foetus
Foetal amputation

Fermentation of dead conceptus
Necrotic villi into endometrium

Contamination of amniotic fluid
Pulmonary lobes atelectasis
Ragged umbilical cord
Placenta infarction and sepsis

Sanguinolent blennorrhoea into membranes
Necrobiosis and aborted debris in womb

Parturition pains and eclampsia
Pregnancy terminated by caesarian
Afterbirth extracted by gynaecologist
Postnatal juices about foeticide

Sterile autolysis
Macerated foetus
Miscarriage.
