[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Exhumation for coroner's inquest
Grave six feet under the ground
Coffin uncovered by forensic surgeon
Necroscopy finding of disintered carrion

Blood suffusions on cranial covering
Encephalic tumours into crushed head
Rotten gore under the smelly skull
Fungal filaments into capilli

Steatosis of epithelia
Fibrosis of cardial muscle
Sclerosis of jugular veins
Partial adipocerous derma

Milk remainders in mammary gland
Ash from tuberculous ulcers
Fatty embolism into necrotic lungs
Disruptions of suppurant kidneys

Heart valves with pathologic excrescences
Corrosion of cirrhotic hepar
Haemal extravasation like to hypostasis
Inorganic poisons into ossa

Fracture of cachectic hyoid bone
Intumescence of enteric loops
Into decaying phlogistic hystera
Fragments of foetal skeleton

Caseation of splanchnic organs
Arid mash inside the chest
Corpsy fauna after bleeding
Botulotoxin at spina bifida

Belly full of undigested meat
Saponification of black and red filth
Burial of remains into earth
Into sarcophagus finish of putrefied season.
