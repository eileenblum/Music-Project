[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Totally chronical senile marasmus
Euthanasia of dying convulsing body
Sudden death by nefarious self immolation
Knife between both hemispheres
Macabre suicide by circular saw
Bleeding gash and difficult lesions

Caustic accidental poisoning of alcoholic
Fatal injury by sick self mutilation

Carbonized head crashed by wheel
Cold oozy zits on squeezed tissue
Frozen wounds of necrolytic scalp
Deceased eaten up by dogs

Ruptured puffy intestines after infanticide
Traumatic section on decayed mummy
Blazing empty hollow corpse
Combustion of charred purpuric remains

Torn in two
Piece by piece
Limbs from limbs

Autopsy of truncated deformed carrion
Plastic bag with burnt limbless cadaver
Entombed rotted to the core.
