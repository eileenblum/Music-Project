[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Violent death of disfigured victim
Purulent succulent carrion
Infestation by swarming maggots
Repulsive stench of putrefaction

Scarification of exuberant bosom
Corpse drenched by rancid blood

Evulsion of fermenting intestines
Minced stumps of hands
Grinding of crumbling brain
Bisected moulding cranium

Ripped bursted rib cage
Laceration of rigid stomach
Carbonization of fossilized torso
Cremation of septic mortal remains.
