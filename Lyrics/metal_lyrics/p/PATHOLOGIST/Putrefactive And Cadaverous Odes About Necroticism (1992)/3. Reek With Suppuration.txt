[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Decomposed putrefied cadaver
Marbling of suppurating flesh
Mortification of connective tissue
Maturation of cerebrospinal fluid
Histological involution of dentition
Fetid caseated viscera
Hepatic sticky matter
Colliquated smeary ureter

Autolytic dissolution of adrenal medulla
Corroding vesiculae on thyroid gland
Bubbling putrid gases in musculature
Cribriform coronary vessels with pustules

Blackness of mushy lung
Disorganized pregnant uterus
Tattered turbid heart
Ossific sinews and arteries
Drying of shrunken tube
Liquefaction of rotten blood
Shreded raggy cholecyst
Pulverized teased marrow

Autodigested gut's mucosa by ferments
Festering tumours of cancerous decay
Calcification of costal cartilages
Maceration of saponified pylorus

Splattered pus is mummified
Disintegration of bones into phosphates
Mustiness of petrified offal
Odour of pyosis and rot.
