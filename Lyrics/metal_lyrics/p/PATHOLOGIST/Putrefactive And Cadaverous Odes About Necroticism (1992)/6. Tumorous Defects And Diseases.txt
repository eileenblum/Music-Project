[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Tumorous parenchyma contains pus
Boils, pimples and festering pores
Pseudotumours on anal tract
Purulence in carbuncles and furuncles

Parasitical cysts into urethra
Chapped soles by scabs and pustules

Septic atrophy with benign tumours
Myxoma's stroma full of phlegms
Ulcerous neoplasms on the pubis
Proliferation of fibroma in mandible

Defect of osteoma in verrucose clunis
Inflammatory lipoma of parotid gland
Quantum of mucus in pathogenic warts
Haemangioma cavernosum of tongue

Malignant blastoma of ovaries
Sarcoma osteogenes of facial skeleton
Haemorrhage and suppuration of metastases
Exulceration of the carcinoma of appendix

Necrosis of infectious cervical nodules
Terminal stage of granuloma gangraenescens.
