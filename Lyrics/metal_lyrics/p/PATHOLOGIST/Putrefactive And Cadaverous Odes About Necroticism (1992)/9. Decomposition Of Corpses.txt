[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Insect, fungi, mildews deform the corpse
Ova of flies in oral and optic corners
Crateriform boring of loins by larvae
Mass of maggots and grubs in cerebral matter

Skull, spinal canal full of blowfly eggs
Worms and beetles into nostrils
Necrophore, scavenger beetle, dermestes
Carrion beetle, dung beetle, mites

Gnawing of carcass by swine
Pecking of eyes by crows
Bitten auricles by rats
Erosion of vagina and uterus by ants
Cicatricial macerated testicles by leechs
Gradual decapitation by sewer rats
Disinterment of carrion's remains - exhumation
Smeary cadaverous wax - adipocere

Dehydration of trunk and inwards - mummification
Anti bacterial and germinal conservation - balsamation.
