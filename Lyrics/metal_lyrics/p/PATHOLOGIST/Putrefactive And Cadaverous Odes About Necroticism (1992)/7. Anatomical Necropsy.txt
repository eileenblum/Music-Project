[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Prosectorium in anatomical pathology ward
On the obduction slab lies fresh cadaver
Dermatic sections on the breast
Removal dermal lobes by scissors

Scalpel cuts through pectoral muscle
Open abdominal cavity by hooks
Extirpation of cardiac and pulmonary parts
Preparation of liver, spleen and kidneys

Dissection of small intestine and caecum
Abscission of suprarenal glands and midriff
Examination of duodenum and gall bladder
Bisection of pelvis by chisel

Fissure of prostate and sacrum
Mortified urinary bladder and rectum
Denudating vertex and separated subcutis
Autopsy of cerebellum and pituitary gland

Disconnection of calvaria by hand saw

Human encephalon conserved into formalin
Exploration of nerves, vessels and arteries
Severance of carpal joints by xyster
Pathologist sews up eviscerated entrails
Corpse in mortuary refrigerator
Acrid effluvia from the morgue.
