[lyrics: Cyklo, music: Hary]

Somatic temperature drops in death agony
Post mortem cold - algor mortis
First on cadaver cool face and limbs
Coldness of fore arms, middle legs, thighs,

Axillae, bosom and genitals
Dank epidermis is frigid - perspiring corpse
Trianguloid drying of conjunctiva
Cataract of cornea, dry lips
Consecutive wrinkling of anus and labia
Lungs affixed on diaphragm and pericardium
Blood not contains oxygen
Increase of plasma, post mortem pallor

Corpse's buttock - livores mortis
Sanguine internal organs - hypostases

Diffusion of bile and flatuses
Black colour of abdominal aorta

Rigidity of muscular fibres - rigor mortis
Stiffness of masticatory, facial, neck's sinews

Dark red coagulations
Necrosis pancreatis
Enzymes in digestive juices
Post mortem self digestion

Fermentation of innards
Autolysis of cells and tissues
Decaying protoplasm
Ptomains into organism

Beginning of putrescence.
