The axe laid to the root
cuts the hour into half
Cuts the hour into half
The falling sands of time are gone
A raised hand abated and swears
A raised hand abated and swears
Before extending to the grains of sand
Again to turn 'em back to Heaven
Don't even try to run away
For that hour you've been born into this world

[CHORUS 1]
To take part of His suffering
Out of space you may even fly
Another Saviour you won't find
In that sandglass you'll remain a captive

Wound up by the Watchmaker's hand
into the circle of life
(Into the circle of life)
You're planted down by the rolls of thunder
Everything that can be shaken quakes
That can be shaken quakes

[CHORUS 2]
To take part of His suffering,
out of space you may even fly
Another Saviour you won't find
In that sandglass you'll remain

[CHORUS 1]

The sieve is placed, is placed below
to gather only wheat into the barn

[CHORUS 2 2x]
