Across the field, a shadow lures slow
Someone died, someone I don't know
The rocks point their finger to the rose-red sky
while the sun is waving goodbye
to the days of old

[CHORUS]
Sheltering your sacred soul
and watering your hope
Now I turn my face to cry
while the moon sings this lullaby

To the days of old [2x]

The lonely nights, the wishful sights
of children at play that never came your way
And while the owl begins this tale to tell,
a star whispers a sweet farewell

[CHORUS]

Watering your hope
Now I turn my face to cry
while the moon sings this lullaby
To the days of old [3x]
