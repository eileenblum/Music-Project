Bury my heart under these lonely thoughts
For I understand I failed to play
To write an ending to any of my stories
And there is nothing left to say

Look in the mirror of fragile hopes
Silvery spider webs entwine all dreams
Time turns to sand and dust in my hands,
and I have no more feelings left behind

Why do we have to live and die?
Perfect by nature
We exist, improve upon the lie
There is no answer
I'm writing a letter to no one
Ever praying, never told

Time is standing still for hours,
even in its run to catch eternity
Eternity, forever not ours
Well, tell me, isn't it insanity? 
Created a perfect picture of the world in my head,
but yes, it's so pointless
This world is already here, put in words
Dreaming icon which makes me senseless

Why do we have to live and die?
Live and die
We exist, improve upon the lie
There is no answer
I'm writing a letter to no one
Ever praying, never told
