When this silence makes me deaf,
I go back to the end of illusions
When the dark sky makes me blind,
please let me be or let me go
In this gallery I walk alone
In every frame, all I see is you
My pain goes on, my time has come
to ask the past for one more chance

So did you call again my name?
Your last and dying scream
I'll never be the same
And when the light becomes so dim,
I'll raze the chains of hate
I'll never be the same again

I won't give up on reaching the stars
Still crucified by my lonely past
These empty feelings in my heart
I just beg and plead for this to be the end

So did you call again my name?
Your last and dying scream
I'll never be the same
And when the light becomes so dim,
I'll break the chains of hate
I'll never be the same again
(Again!)
