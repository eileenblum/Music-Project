Do you remember me?
I am the one who lived
Have you forgotten me?
Somebody who died
The soul is blank, the wishes hollow
The light I follow has gone too dark
Has gone too dark [4x]

And my view is blank
My thoughts've been spoken
My dream is not dead
To let it haunt me 'till the end
The one I thought I knew
has betrayed me, and that's me
It's all blank now, do you see?
I turned off the light: did you?
I turned off the light [4x]
(Light)

My reflection is so blank
My lines've been read
My hideaway is not my land
It's not a beginning nor an end

[CHORUS 2x]
Drown inside of me, I'm a blank file now
I am blank, can't you see?
Blame for a crown
Deep inside of you, you're a blank file now
We're blank, do you see?
Blame for a crown

Drown inside of me
I am blank, can't you see?
Blame for a crown
Deep inside of you
We're blank, do you see?
Blame for a crown
