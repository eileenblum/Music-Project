Hey you, do you hide your face behind the lies? 
I can feel the hate that's always flowing through you 
Your lust for power clouds your mind inside 
when the bleeding moon is shining bright

Oh, I see the scare in your eyes
And all behind a face cold as ice
It's time to pay the most expensive price
I'll become a wolf in disguise

When the sun goes down and darkness falls
and the shadows haunt these burning eyes
All delusions are gone, you'll have to try
to see again my tempting smile

Oh, I wish you'd taste my sinful pain
I'm an unseen guest from your bad dream
Getting more real than it seems 
Just say a prayer and carry your fate

And when this masquerade comes to an end,
I'm here to take your pain away
Although I'm a creature in a human shape,
prepare to play my twisted game

Oh, I wish you'd taste my sinful pain 
I'm an unseen guest from your bad dream 
It's time to pay the most expensive price
I'll become a wolf in disguise
Oh, I see the scare in your eyes
And all behind a face cold as ice
Getting more real than it seems 
Just say a prayer and carry your fate
