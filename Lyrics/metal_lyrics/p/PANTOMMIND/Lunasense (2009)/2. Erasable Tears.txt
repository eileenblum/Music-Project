End me now
Erase me, why won't you let me fade? 
I hang on by a spider's thread
My heart's been torn away

[PRE-CHORUS]
Can't you see I'm fake? 
Such a futile, bold mistake
I offer humbly in cupped hands 
my soul for you, you to take

But all that lives in pallid fingers, frozen ice
In deepest Hell I hold me
Please Heaven, take my life!
Chilled subzero to the bone, 
I'm frigid to the core
My hands hold you, need you,
but slipping ever more,
but slipping ever more

What little difference does it make
to keep it all inside
until I fall and break apart?
In agony I cry
Am I the insidious beast? 
Will you tame my flailing wake?
Under my processions, how much can you take?

[PRE-CHORUS]

Should I let you free, my bird to fly and set anew,
or bade me take you under wing,
as you would have me do?
I know not the things that come
I plead, my love, I'm trying, but darling, I am
Sorry I can't keep myself
Sorry I can't keep myself
Sorry I can't keep myself from crying
