In the early morning, I gazed upon the shores
It seems I've found what I've been searching for
I've traveled through a lifetime across the seven mystic seas
I'm not afraid to carry onward to the far horizons

[CHORUS]
And many kingdoms I have seen
In the land of giants and titans, I've spent too many years
I've heard such different stories about those glorious kings,
but their sons and their protectors I've not met

And I have nothing left to lose
To live or die, it's all the same to me
All alone I stand here, lost in shadows,
and the dreary clouds surround me once again

Why do I stand all my life at a crossroads?
Who is there to show me the right way?
Something wrong is sleeping deep inside of me
I can't escape this

[CHORUS]

All the years the truth I've searched for has eluded me
I tried to see beyond the future and the past
Here I am, at last I'm finally home into infinity
Somehow I've reached eternal peace of mind
