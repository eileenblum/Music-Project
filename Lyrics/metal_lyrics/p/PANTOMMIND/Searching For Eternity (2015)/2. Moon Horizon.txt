Your eyes are stare somewhere on the wall
For a moment you wipe all the time away
Changing the sinister noise to mighty silence
You left beyond the gray reality
There's a mystery place
There is your sanctuary
From there your way just begins

Moon horizons
Far beyond the color of your dream
Something hidden from your sight
Moon horizons
So far away
Horizons
Visions from the Other sideâ¦ 

Your soul is born to see in the future
Heavenly like a crystal lake
You still trying to go against the stream of your reflections
Behind the temple walls of your freedom

Moon horizons
Far beyond the color of your dream
Something hidden from your sight
Moon horizons
So far away
Horizons
Visions from the Other side â¦ 

Night after day - day after night
You still try to be the same dead or alive
Waking in the dream
You feels like a part of this world
You will be set free

Moon horizons
Far beyond the color of your dream
Something hidden from your sight
Moon horizons
So far away
Horizons
Visions from the Other sideâ¦ 

Ohâ¦horizons
So far awayâ¦
