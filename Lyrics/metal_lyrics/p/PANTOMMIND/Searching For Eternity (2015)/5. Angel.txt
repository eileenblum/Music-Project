In darkness and perhaps in vain
But you were my shadow, my home
My salvation from all that pain

I wasn't quite an angel before I met you
Just a shadow of what I should've been
I knew all those angels, they fell first out of view
But the land of hell was not what I have seen

I was young and longed to learn
So you were my true answer to all
You're everything I wanted to earn
I knew you'd catch me if I fall

I wasn't quite an angel before I met you
Just a shadow of what I should've been
I knew all those angels, they fell first out of view
But the land of hell was not what I have seen

I was a sinner before your perfect light
A demon long time ago gone astray...
I wanted to scream "Please hold me tight"
But just said to myself again

(x2) I wasn't quite an angel before I met you
Just a shadow of what I should've been
I knew all those angels, they fell first out of view
But the land of hell was not what I have seen
