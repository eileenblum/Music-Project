As we stand here in the moonlight
Tell me the story of your life
Of your soul, is there any light?
Tell me about your pain
As we watch all the stars above
Tell me, tell me what you think about
Is it fear, apathy or is it love?
I believe in you without a doubt
Without a doubt

[2x]
How do we look at each other?
So tell me about your sorrow
Is there anything that bothers you?
Tell me, I wanna know

Cause you remain silent in front of me
Speak to me of dreams unfulfilled
Of music filled your heart so deep
Tell me what's your truth indeed

[2x]
How do we look at each other?
So tell me about your sorrow
Is there anything that bothers you?
Tell me, I wanna know

As we stay here in silence
Tell me...No, don't say a word
I don't need this to make sense
Don't speak, I know your world
I know your world...

[2x]
How do we look at each other?
So tell me about your sorrow
Is there anything that bothers you?
Tell me, I wanna know
