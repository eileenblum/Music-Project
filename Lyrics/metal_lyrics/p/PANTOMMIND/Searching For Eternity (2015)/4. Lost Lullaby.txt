The greatest truth is in lies
Grave is all we'll be given
And maybe a couple of goodbyes
Or a last kiss from a rose even

Rain from a clear cloudless sky
Are the tears in my eyes
Frozen candle - neverending cry
My soul of lost lullaby

Ragdoll is the most beautiful toy
To a child not poor inside
Pantomime - words for that boy
Who doesn't know what's right

(x4) Rain from a clear cloudless sky
Are the tears in my eyes
Frozen candle - neverending cry
My soul of lost lullaby
