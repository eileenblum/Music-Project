Can you ever tie the wind in trap?
Can you lock the human spirit up?
Never!
âCause your powerâs gone away
When it turns against the spirit way
Donât you know the eternal truth?
You see - the human soul is born unchained and free
Searching for eternity

So enter through your dream deep inside
And listen the call of the wild
Just spread your wings and fly
Fly so highâ¦.
Come - right freeborn
Living in the endlessness of time
Searching for eternityâ¦

Free your mind and follow me
To the shine of the new horizons
The time has come
To break the silence of disgrace

Fly away to the distant ancient stars
Reaching behind the real lies
Breaking the chains of the slavery

Donât try to turn the freedom
Donât try to twist the faith
Listen to your Alter Ego
Throw away your sinful hate
Stay away from the shadows of the past
Your spirit will be free at last
âTill the wisdom change
âTill the wisdom change

Now is the time for a New Revelation
For a future realization
Take away all of your vices from the past
Stay away from the liars in disguise

Enter through your mind deep inside
And listen the call of the wild
Just spread your wings and fly
Fly so highâ¦.
Come - right freeborn
Living in the endless dreamâ¦
Searching for eternity
