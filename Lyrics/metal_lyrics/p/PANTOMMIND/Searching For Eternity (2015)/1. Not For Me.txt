Footprints on the hot summer sand
Sunshine never left me for a while
Eternal summer for a little child
Who lives in his Wonderland
Watching another crimson sunrise
Hand in hand we felt out of time
Having no idea how to play the game
Called life - fall and rise again

It's a gold dreamful summer again
Footprints on the hot summer sand
Two teens in love on no-man's-land
Sun shines for them, for me it's rain

But not for me
It's not for me again...
But not for me
It's not for me again...

Footprints on the hot summer sand
Slaying every dream, living on the edge
We were living the most perfect time
The awesome life with no rain

This gold summer is not here anymore
The sun has turned its back on me
And left me here with no eyes to see
Sun shines for them, for me it's rainâ¦

But not for me
It's not for me again...
But not for me
It's not for me again...

It's a gold dreamful summer again
Footprints on the hot summer sand
Two teens in love on no-man's-land
Sun shines for them, for me it's rain

(x2) But not for me
It's not for me again...
But not for me
It's not for me again...
