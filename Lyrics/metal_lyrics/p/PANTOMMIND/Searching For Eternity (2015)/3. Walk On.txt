Some morning tide will bring a day
When black and white will blend to gray
Your truths will turn a tangled mess
Pretending different will hurt no less
You'll search, but you will never find
You've got to turn to look inside
And once you lift the lid of lies
Reach in and take hold of your mind

Inside your mind there'll be a thought
Just hold on to it! Lose it not!
I'll take you to the Shadow's Well
It's deep and black, it leads to hell
Keep climbing down when it's too hard
Don't flinch when you are dealt your card
Hang on when you can hang no more
And in the dark you'll find your heart

It is a flame, it is a torch
A road that starts beyond your porch
It'll wind and turn and twist and bend
Through bumps and cracks and rocks and sand
But you will walk on

You'll feed your flame and it will burn
And when your path ends, looking back
You'll see it's straight, without a turn

Inside your heart there'll be a door
The keys that open it are four
One's love, and lust, and hate, one's will
All can revive and all can kill
Choose now before it grows too late
And once you've entered through the gate
Between the past and what's to come
You will discover there your fate

It is a flame, it is a torch
A road that starts beyond your porch
It'll wind and turn and twist and bend
Through bumps and cracks and rocks and sand
But you will walk on
But you will walk on
But you will walk on

What lies beyond there? I can't tell
But mark my words, and mark them well
Don't think, don't ponder, don't delay
You cannot hold back, cannot stay
You'll have to trust me that I know
That tide will rise and you must go
And once you do, don't ever fear
It's nothing difficult: you grow

It is a flame, it is a torch
A road that starts beyond your porch
It'll wind and turn and twist and bend
Through bumps and cracks and rocks and sand
But you will walk on, you will learn
You'll feed your flame and it will burn
And when your path ends, looking back
You'll see it's straight, without a turn

But you will walk on
But you will walk on
But you will walk on
