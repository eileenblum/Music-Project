Leave me alone with the silent whispers
In the cool waves from the sea of my destiny
Watching the lights of the rising sun
I'll send away my mind to my own Promised Land

Maybe I lose my self control
Staring into the sun
I feel like I've been lost
in a psychotic world
Morpheus speaks to me
Through a vision of lies
All my pain has come
From inside of my mind

So wasted years I was slaving under
The system of lies
And I've failed to see
The crucial point of the life

Feels like a blind leading the blind
All the sacred dreams faded to the silence
And again and again the pain will call
At last I'll close my eyes till say goodbye

Farewellâ¦See the Universe through my eyes
Until I meet you on the other sideâ¦
Donât you tell me what's wrong and right
Say goodbye until we meet in the skyâ¦

(x2) Feels like a blind leading the blind
All the sacred dreams faded to the silence
And again and again the pain will call
At last I'll close my eyes till say goodbye

Farewellâ¦See the Universe through my eyes
Until I meet you on the other sideâ¦
Donât you tell me what's wrong and right
Try to find the better things of life...
