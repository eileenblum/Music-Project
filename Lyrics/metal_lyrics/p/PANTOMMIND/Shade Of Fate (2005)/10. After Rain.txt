[Christ/Ivan]

Slowly I awake in the same empty room
Feeling lost in the illusion of the last rainy night
When my visions seem so real
The morning comes to rescue me

Can you fly on the wings of dream
Can you see the city with my eyes
Morbid sadness - silence of the void
It never really ends ...

Oh ...sweet city waiting for another day
See the light of the first morning sunray
Far beyond the ancient mountains
Reach for a rainbow in the sky
Suddenly - your dreams come true

After rain - fantasy horizons of a dream
Morning freshness it embraces my soul
After rain - the world seems to be born....
Becoming new once again

If you are a dreamer
And feel your spirit free and strong
To change this rainy world
And wipe away all the tears of sorrow
Fly away to the land of the blind forgotten souls
Dying in the sea of sin and pain

But can the world ... never really change
After rain the sun will dry away
All the sins from your face

I'll never forget that strange
Rainy night
When the tears from my face
Felt  like raindrops from the sky...
