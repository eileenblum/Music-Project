[Christ]

Night and day go round
And weaves a spell of lies and greed
The mask of grey forms silently...
It hides away your face in vain
The sunset fades with all the memories
It leaves the frozen tears behind
Beyond the madness of this drowning world

Why can't see the light
Why can't feel the wind
Why can't hear the rain
Why feels too alone
Why is afraid to die
Why is scared to live
Why rejects this world of fears
Lie ... it's just a lie

As tears are rollin' down
They wash away ...
Only they can wash away
The mess in yourself

Close your eyes again
To hear the rain
Close your eyes
And you'll find everything
Everything...
