[Christ/Magnusson]

The sunset is sleeping in my window
The mountains are resting on the floor
A rainbow is hanging from the ceiling
And a whisper knocking on my door...
On my door...
On my door...

Whisper knocking on
Whisper knocking on
Knocking on my door
Moonlight dancing on
Dancing on the wall
Chasing memories inside my mind...
