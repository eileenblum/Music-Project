[Christ/Ivan]

Would you like to understand
Who you really are my friend?
I'm ready to show you another point of view
It is time to change your mind
Come with me to an outlying side
Reach the clouds beyond the outer sky ...

Follow...
Follow me into the light
See the stars starting to shine bright
There's no more time to loose

If you don't understand my advice
Just you find out a reason to live ...
Bury me in the sands of the past
You're of some different kind
All your dreams were a lie
You'll never see this world behind

Follow...
Follow me into the light
See the stars starting to shine bright
There's no more time to loose
Follow...
Follow me on the wings of the wind
Sailing to the timeless shores
On the edge of last good byes

I know a distant land which exist beyond
There's a perfect place for you
I fell you've been waiting for a miracle all your life
Stop fooling yourself
Don't try to be the same anymore

It's time for your decision
So I can't wait no longer
Your final quest is over
I am the only one...
