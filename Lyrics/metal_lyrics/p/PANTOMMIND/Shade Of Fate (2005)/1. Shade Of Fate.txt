[Christ/Ivan]

Look at the sky - can you see what I see
I saw that strange dark shine of the stars
Maybe tonight many of them will fall down and die
Some life will be wasted... another one will arise

I know the time is near
And we can't stop it
I know-or it's just this bad blood of mine?
Somewhere a secret gate remains opened
Another one is closed forever

It's so hard to understand
Where's the end of the circle of life
We have no time to find all the answers...
Can we escape from the shade of fate
~From the voices in my head...

It's so hard to understand
Where's the end of this circle of life
We have no time to find all the answers...
Can we escape from the shade of fate
~From the voices in my head
Whispering again and again
Can you feel the cold embrace of fate
I hear screams into my head ...
