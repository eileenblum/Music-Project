[Christ/Ivan]

When the morning comes
And you stand alone by the window
Try to find me - I'll be somewhere out there
The endless universe I flew
Across the oceans of time
My spirit still stays on
My pain will never disappear

Keep the fire - burning in my soul
I'm your shelter from the storm
Fell my shadow.. calling from the dust
Don't consign your dreams into the silence

When the night falls down
You'll be looking for my face in your memories
Trying to call me from faraway beyond
I'll be there- imaginable reflection
~From the candle light shining next to you
You ever know where's the key
~From the castle of our fantasy
And whenever when you feel too spent
Just spread your wings and fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away...

Keep the fire - burning in my soul
I'm your shelter from the storm
Feel my shadow calling from the dust
Don't consign your dreams into the silence
