When the rain falls in the night 
And the solitude takes my heart 
When I feel that I'm alone
Your arms are there to rest 

When the winter takes my soul 
There you are, to burn a light of hope 
And I cannot ask for more 
You are all to me, my dearest dream...

The whispering that always calls
The peaceful lake where my heart dwells
You are the voice that always sings
And all the stars of the night sky

The whispering that always calls 
The peaceful lake where my heart dwells 
You are the voice that always sings 
And all the stars of the night sky 

When the road turns hard to walk 
And the pain hits hard inside my heart 
When I feel that all is lost 
Your arms are there to rest

When the winter takes my soul
There you are, to burn a light of hope
And I cannot ask for more
You are all to me, my dearest dream...

The whispering that always calls
The peaceful lake where my heart dwells
You are the voice that always sings
And all the stars of the night sky

The whispering that always calls
The peaceful lake where my heart dwells
You are the voice that always sings
And all the stars of the night sky
