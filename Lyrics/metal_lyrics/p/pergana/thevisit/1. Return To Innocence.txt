Memories are passing by 
While innocence is leaving us 
The magical dreams of fantasy 
Forever disappeared 

Pure emotions are lost in time 
And the madness filled our minds 
We forgot who we really are 
And the dreamland passed away 

Why little child? 
I left you go 
Why I left you die? 

Return to Innocence 
Let the magic born again 
Reach the sun and catch its rays 
Inside, deep in your heart 

Return to Innocence 
Let the magic born again 
Reach the sun and catch its rays 
Return to Childhood
