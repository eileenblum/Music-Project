Come here, a little closer 
Your eyes, make me feel safe 
Angel, can you hear me? 
I'll give you all my life 

Hold me, a little tighter 
And I'll be free for a moment 
Angel, would you heal me? 
I'll give you all my heart 

With her white wings wide open she appeared 
And the deaf could hear, and the blind could see 
From the darkness, she kidnapped his soul 
To take it away from its prison 

White rose, guardian of my soul 
I waited for you so long, unveil your heart 
Sing to me, reveal your secrets now 
And I'll be free, my heart will be healed once more

With her white wings wide open she appeared
And the deaf could hear, and the blind could see
From the darkness, she kidnapped his soul
To take it away from its prison
