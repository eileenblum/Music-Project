[Bonus Track][feat. The Holzwarth Brothers]In the darkness all alone
He can't forget what he has done
His memories come like ghosts
To torment his heart and soul

In dreams, he saw his past
He could not believe, how blind he was
He lost her, long time ago
Betraying, his life and her love

His past is chasing him
To every corner of his dreams
How could his heart be free this way?
If all he can feel this nightâ¦ is shame

Why is a man's heart so fragile like glass?
What makes a man forget himself?
The only hope for the fallen is regret
The only way to take back his soul again

A sad violin sings in the starless night
Through pain his soul has been slowly purified...

"His regret is a healer and sin is finally absolved"

Why is a man's heart so fragile like glass?
What makes a man forget himself?
The only hope for the fallen is regret
The only way to take back his soul again

The only hope for the fallen is regret
The only way to take back his soul again
