[Music: Adrian Benegas, Lyrics: Adrian Benegas &amp; Audrey Laure]

A ghost roaming through the night
Raided in a tired mind
Defenseless a heart fell
Into illusion's false ways

Screaming with its lying verb
The shadow perverted the light
Defenseless a heart fell
Into the maze of torment's games

The dusk as cries of despair
Gave him his afterglow
Hopeless his heart felt
Without headlight in the storm

Screaming with its lying verb
The shadow perverted the light
Defenseless a heart fell
Into an eternal pain

Frozen Heart, a loveless life
Out of Brightness, empty blinded eyes
Frozen Heart,a deceived mind
Out of magic,empty broken life
