Is this the price
Iâm paying, God of mine
Being alone in the Earth
With my mind and my heart
I sacrificed my life
I was longing for a sign
A poem born in the stars
Recited to my heart
Is this the price
I'm paying, rose in white
The rain falls from my eyes
In the starless nights
I sacrificed my life
I was longing for a sign
A poem born in the stars
Recited to my heart
Is this the price
Iâm paying, Lovely child
Now Iâm alone in the dark
Innocence left me far
I sacrificed my life
I was longing for a sign
A poem born in the stars
Recited to my heart

Mysterious Death
Write in your book my name
And let the silence sing
Her requiem
