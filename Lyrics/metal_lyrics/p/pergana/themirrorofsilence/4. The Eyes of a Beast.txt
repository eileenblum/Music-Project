[Music &amp; Lyrics: Adrian Benegas]

Finally fate found us here face to face
You rape my beauty and spit on my name
Now you can't deceive me cause' Iâm not the same
You canât corrupt the truth once again
I turned all colors into black
I am your master, I'm seven in one
Don't deny my desires, I am the master
You're my slave, my slave, my slave
You can't deceive my opened eyes
Hiding lies showing untrue angelic light
Iâm breaking your marionette's chains
You can't corrupt the truth once again
Do you think what you say is true?
You make me laugh with your stupid words
Don't deny my desires, I am the Master
You will fall, you will fall, and you will fall
Eyes of a Beast
Burning trough our heart beats
Hypnotic lights seducing us
To shed the red wine
