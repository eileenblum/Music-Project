Through the gates of cataract
Black galleys leap their way.
damp turn the planks around me here
With over-splashing spray.

Moonlight waters 
I'm captured by your spell
Imprisoned in your beam.
Moonlight waters
In this trap I fell
attracted by your drift.

Captive held and offered meal
No human dares to eat.
Will this go on and never heal,
This dizzy, fevered heat ?

Moonlight waters 
I'm captured by your spell
Imprisoned in your beam.
Moonlight waters
In this trap I fell
attracted by your drift.

On the moon's side obscured
Time stands still and fate seems to have deserted me...

Sinister guards build torched rows,
Where are they taking me ?
No judgement on me seems it owes
The crawling toads monstrosity !

Moonlight waters 
I'm captured by your spell
Imprisoned in your beam.
Moonlight waters
In this trap I fell
attracted by your drift.
