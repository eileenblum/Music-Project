Down ten times seven in lightest slumber
To where the bearded priests pray.
In the shadow of the flame
Where none has seen the light of day.

Then reporting his intention
Pleading for some advice.
But wisemens words are no relief
For Gods wish not to be disturbed.

Kuranes was the one of three
Of all in all eternity.
Ever to come back unharmed
Two fell into insanity !

Beware! Nyarlathotep's thousand forms
Bed every victim down !
This blurry way, this icy road
Will only lead to your death.
