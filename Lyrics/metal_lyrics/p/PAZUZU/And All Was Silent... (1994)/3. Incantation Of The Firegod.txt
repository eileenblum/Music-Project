A time of chaos now approaches us.
The light cries out in pain.
Eternal flame is now extinguished.
Satan rules again.
The joy in the hands of eternal winter.
Like water drowning in snow.
12 disciples gather slowly around the throne of stone whence he came,
master of
the unseen.
I mutter a prayer of hate.
Destroy the creation of god.
Feast upon the blood of mortals.
Turn their blood to wine their soul without a shelter.
Their bones to build a realm
