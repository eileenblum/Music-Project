Cast away from joy
Let me fear your pain
Greet me with a dark heart
Rising as the same
I will pull your pain through the eternal flame
Let me fear your pain
Greet me with a dark heart
Rising as the same
Let me fell your pain
Through the eternal flame
Let me feel your pain
Cast away from joy
Greet me with a dark heart
Cast away from joy
Rising as the same
Ask my dying soul
The sin of (truth) will (spawn)
No truth lies at my feet
Man shall do as he please
I was cast from heaven's grace
On soul wings, I forever fly
Ask my dying soul
The sin of (truth) will (spawn)
No truth lies at my feet
Man shall do as he please
I was cast from heaven's grace
On soul wings, I forever fly
