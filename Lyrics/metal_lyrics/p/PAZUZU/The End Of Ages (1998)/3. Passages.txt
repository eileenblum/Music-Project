Time runs short and shorter still, as bodies fade and die
The plague now unites us, and in death we're so alike
As clergy, noble or poor...
The archangels wrath as blood now drowns our world
The sins of mankind, The plague, the price that we now pay...

As in the 15th century, man will fall to a plague of mass calamity...
renewal is at hand...
