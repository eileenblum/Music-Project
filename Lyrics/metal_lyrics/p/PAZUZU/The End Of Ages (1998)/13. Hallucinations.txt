Pale colors paint the picture of mankinds usurped hallucination
You dreamt but alas you were dead.
A faded bruised clone of the imitation that was copied centuries ago
There is no wailing and no grief and there are not enough tears in the
sky to mourn the fall of man, not enough strength to raise our heads
and say farewell...

Heaven is empty...deserted the palace now lies...Renewal is at hand...
