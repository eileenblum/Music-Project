With a great clash of thunders Roar at the eve of the eclipse, the
armies of doom, took on the battalions of light...

The carnage was tremendous, as blood the heavens drowned...Eternal
Darkness, would now embrace the world...

The battle of Armageddon rages to decide the fate of the universe...
renewal is finally at hand.
