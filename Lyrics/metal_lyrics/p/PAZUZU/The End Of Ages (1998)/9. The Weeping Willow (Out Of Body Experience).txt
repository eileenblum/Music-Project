I saw my soulless body roam through these empty halls at night,
Desolate and alone I dream of a dream, as dark figures hover over my body, and
a lonely weeping willow, cries silently into a lake, as voices beckon me
to drown...to drown...
Through a world of perfect black, hallucinogenic substances feed my
veins, as I trip from one room to the next...distorted faces and the
voice of an angel, as I float never to return...
