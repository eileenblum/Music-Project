Hidden, by Saturn's centennial eclipse, the dark-stars align...and
Beyond the desolate landscapes, hidden well from all mans eye, lies a place,
In a dimension undreamed of...
Here the beast will feast, and here, planets will fall...
Follow the echo of bells, to the palace in the lake of tears...

Endless grief, at millenniums dawn, and in an empty ballroom, demons
Beckon the world farewell !

At the dawn of the new aeon... Planets will bow to the beast... Renewal is at hand...
