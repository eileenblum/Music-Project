Hark my friend: for an ancient tale I tell.
It is written that five mighty Emperors will die
and their ancient palaces will a furious being.
Nine kingdoms will unite under one hand.
A roaring sea beneath the earth; a churning lake of sour tears.
One black raven for every wind will tear the crystal eyes.
Now, as the final night proudly enrobes the land,
a whisper is heard in the sky... Awaken the Dragon.
