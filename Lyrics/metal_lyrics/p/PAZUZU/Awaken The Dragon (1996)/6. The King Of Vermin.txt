I am the king of vermin, rodents, rats and plagues.
Of all the darkside, I am monarch, a duke to thrones unknown.
My palace of flesh, a river of souls.
My guards, the souls of war.
Between light and darkness,
between time and infinity, lies my realm I call my own.
I hail nor good, nor a I evil.
I tell not truth, yet I don't lie.
I am not ugly or do I charm.
I hide among the shades.
Although my chest carries a heart, it serves its purpose not.
For life it doesn't bring to me, love and hate is dust.
Without movement still in time, usurping life itself.
I am of substance and of air, a story told no more.
I am not dead and yet I sleep, I do not hear, yet I'm not deaf.
My hands can shape and must destroy, a gracious being, yet insecure.
I am king and I am begger.
I am what you call destiny.
