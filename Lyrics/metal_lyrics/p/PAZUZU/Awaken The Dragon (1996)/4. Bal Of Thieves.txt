Dancing dancing round and round, listen to the Robin's song.
All the rogues and all the thieves across the land come to dance.
With your wife or on your own, at this table your are guest.
Bal of Thieves, a feast of fun, dancing to the morning sun.
Drink a lot there's here for all, a jester rolls across the room.
Maiden young and full of life, come oh come be mine tonight.
In a lure now hidden well the thieves and rogues of London dwell.
Far away from men of law, for if they're caught they'll surely hang.
Among the night their work is done, stealing from the sleeping men.
Robbing jewels and gold and gems, run oh run your work is done.
