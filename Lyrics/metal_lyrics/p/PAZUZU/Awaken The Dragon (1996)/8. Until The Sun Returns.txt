Cry my love for I shall not return.
Into battle I must leave and death awaits me there.
As a hero not a coward I want my name to stand.
The cross has robed our life - At least I will now die standing.
I refuse and deny a human coward to be my rightful god.
Was it not time and wisdom that shaped me to be a man.
So if my life must now end, I am ready to leave this world.
We are few but they are thousands.
Should I not return back home, my blade I leave to my beloved son.
Eye to eye, heart by heart -  At the break of the dawn
the last and only battle will be fought.
Men of war, mages and our ancestors,
all as one will fight until the sun returns.
