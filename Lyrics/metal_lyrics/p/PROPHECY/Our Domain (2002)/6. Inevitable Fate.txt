Inevitable Fate
I've got a story your ears must hear
This tale is of birth, life and death
One you might recognize before you go
If you think you can escape the truth
You're only fooling yourself
You begin in your mother's womb
Spawned by your father's load
Conceived in love or a moments lust
Ashes to ashes dust to fuckin' dust
As it flows...into the egg
It feeds the...necessary things
In...nine...months...you...are...born
Spit out of your mother's womb
Your life has now begun
You've risen from your tomb
As you grow in this world of shit
Trying to make sense of existence
You must learn along the way
Your only chance is your persistence
Spit out of your mother's womb
Your life has now begun
One thing you will do is die
Only choice is where you go
All you need to do is try
One thing you will do is die
Inevitable death is what you face
Inevitable fate is what you create
We all play the game of life
It starts without instructions
During the passing of time itself
We all learn the meaning of destruction
Surrounded by evil - you don't know
Headed to a tomb - Once again
You can't stop it - It's time to go
Your existence will end
We all play the game of life
It starts without instructions
Those with courage to decide
Are those that will succeed
