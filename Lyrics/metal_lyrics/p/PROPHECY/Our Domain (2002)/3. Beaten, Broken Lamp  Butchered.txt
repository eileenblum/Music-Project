To sing about a human body being cut, bloated and disfigured...
Is to repeat, re-write, regurgitate the same thing that's been done
Take a look at every gore band and their lyrics to which I regard
You can only describe the way in which one mutilates and destroys
the human body in so many ways before the concept of this has been
done to death
This is not meant to lay blame or put down bands that write this way
For we are one I merely offer another perspective
The brutal death metal world will not grow if we don't allow it
Mutilate the mainstream while creating our own
Butcher the world that disregards ours
We'll replace it with brutal death metal
After it's been Beaten, Broken and Butchered
They think if they just ignore us we'll go away
They refuse to realize that we're here to stay
We will not stop until they're Beaten
Our force of brutality will leave them Broken
Once brutal death metal has conquered
The so-called mainstream will be left Butchered
Fuck the system as we know it
With their double standards and shit
Use common sense, not what they use
Only method they know is accuse and abuse
Don't stop until they're Beaten, Broken and Butchered
