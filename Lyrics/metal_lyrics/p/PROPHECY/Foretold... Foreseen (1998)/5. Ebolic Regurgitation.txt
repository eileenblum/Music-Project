[Words:  James Parks II/Phil Holland]
[Music:  Prophecy]

Ebolic regurgitation, feel your flesh rot exhilarate, 
euphoric with life exuberant, not to despair obligatory 
fate turning to fear obstruction of life, death is near.   
Infectious disease fluids decay bodily functions rotting away 
spastic defecation spawning the reek excrement of flesh forming the meek.  
Ebulation, inner mutilation caused by extreme regurgitation 
mutating organs exonerate existence.  
Infernal attack of disease leaking fluids seals your demise confrontation 
of death non-existence of flesh.   
[SOLO (Boogie)] 
Feel your flesh-rot away from the bone smell the stench of decay 
see the skin-peel away- from inside.
