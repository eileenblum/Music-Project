Out of my way
You got nothin' to say
'Bout how I gotta' live my life

Modern man need no helpin' hand
Spend my life searchin'
For the promised land

Modern man, modern man
Spend my life searchin'
For the promised land

Modern man, modern man
Get my dinner
Wherever I can
Modern man
Need no company
If I want a friend
I just talk to me

Should you dare
Try and understand
Don't want no pity
For the modern man

Modern man, modern man
Want no pity for the modern man
Modern man, modern man
Get my dinner
From the garbage can

Modern man future foretold
A shadow cast across the globe
'Lest darkness brings us to our knees
Through doubt, despair, unknown disease
Repugnant life the cross you bear
Through empty eyes and vacant stare
Reflection to society
Mankind beware, you'll reap what you seed

Out of my way
You got nothin' to say
'Bout how I gotta' live my life

Modern man I need no helpin' hand
Spend my life searchin'
For the promised land

Modern man, modern man
Get my dinner
From the garbage can

Modern man
