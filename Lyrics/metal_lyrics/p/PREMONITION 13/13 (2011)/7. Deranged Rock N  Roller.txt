Live fast play loud
Heart's out on the stage
Easy come easy go
Livin' for today

Some die some try
Some they go insane
Deranged rock n roller
I won't change

Rollin' out at three a.m.
Had a lot of fun
Time now to get high
And greet the Sun

Pills for my head
And my drinks I make 'em strong
Little mama laying in my bed
Cuttin' lines three feet long

Deranged rock n roller
Ain't no fix
Full throttle all the time
'Till it breaks

When it's my time
My time to pass
I hope I'm high
High as a bat

When it's my time
To go away
I wanna' die
Sweatin' on stage

Deranged rock n roller
Deranged
Deranged rock n roller
Deranged
