Sweatin' cold
Trembling at daybreak
The blinding Sun
Your God he spoke

Put on this Earth
Simply to suffer
Bear the weight
Of the Human yoke

See the candle
In the window
The warmth and comfort
Of her room

Now she beckons
And you must go
To the solace
Of her spoon

Awaken
This life
Forsaken
Now die

Cold enchantress
Souls are screaming now
Cold enchantress
Try and flee her now

See the fires
Burning at midnight
Steaming cauldron
Black as coal

La hechicera
De la jeringa
The gleaming needle
Has your soul

Awaken
This dream
Been taken

Cold enchantress
Try and flee her now
Hold in rapture
Your soul is screaming now

Spirits gone
Now to the grave

Try to run
No place to hide
Just a slave
You wear her chains
