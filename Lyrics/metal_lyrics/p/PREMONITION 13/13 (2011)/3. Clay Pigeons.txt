Unruly paupers
Amassing in the blue zone
Drunk and angry
Their livelihoods in question

Weld more shackles
Into the rail cars
You know there's more resistance
Than we planned for

Newborns torn from the breast
Of their mothers
To be kept underground
Nurtured for their organs

Mirror polished footwear
Of the serial debunker
Micro chipped and hypnotized
Takes a fall for the bombing

Home is where you
Hang your hate on
Be silent, keep working
No more questions

Pearly whites
Of your neighbor's constant smile
The ideal
Of the professional Christian

Bugged by the feds for
What you saw in the canyon
Death threats
The disappearance of your father

Kidnapped children
By the thousands
Sit in chairs
That were built by Orion

Century of the New World Order
Protect their piggy banks and jewels
Before they'd help their neighbor

Bugged by the Feds
For what you saw in the canyon
Name the projects painted black
