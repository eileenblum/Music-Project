[Lethal Intent (D. Caldwell)]

I see your face
In the morning sun
You're telling me
That I'm the one

I walk away
Sometimes I'm so cold

It's hard to say
It's hard to say
It's hard to say
I love

The tears roll down
Like pouring rain
Say your heart is breaking
Can't stand the pain

I just laugh
Sometimes I'm so cold, so cold

It's hard to say
It's hard to say
It's hard to say
I love
