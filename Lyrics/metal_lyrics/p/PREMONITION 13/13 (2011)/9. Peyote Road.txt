The road is long in coming
A serpent winding through
Dreamscapes of the life between
Despair and paradise

Master of movement measure
Give us strength
Strength to push on

River's song is running
Wing through dimensions
And the right page turn
We use the gifts of God

Master of movement measure
Give us strength
Strength to push on
