Aint....Gonna wait anymore
Calling out to the forces of nature
Won't you take my hand?

See....The light shining down
From the Sun in the sky
As it warms you

World keep on turning
Everything's converting

Feel....For the first time
Like a newborn child as it cries out
For the love you've been missing

Hear....The wind as it blows
Through the leaves in the trees
And it calls you

World keeps on turning
Everything convering

Realize what dreams were
Once to you
And live the life
That you know you were meant to

Realize what dreams were
Once to you
And live the life
That you know you were meant to
