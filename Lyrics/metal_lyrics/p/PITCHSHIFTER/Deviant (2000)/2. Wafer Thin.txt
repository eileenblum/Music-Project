Nothing's cool, nothing's clean, nothing's like it used to be. Nothing's sweet, nothing's smooth, nothing's got the best of me. 
And no one's scared, 'cause no one cares now nothing's got a place to be. And no one cares, 'cause no one dares, and nothing's gonna comfort me.
You're wafer thin, you do me in, say nothing like you used to be. You're wafer thin, you do me in, stay nothing like the rest of me.
Nothing's right, nothing's sane, nothing's how it could've been. Nothing's straight, nothing's pure, yeah nothing's what it should've been.
