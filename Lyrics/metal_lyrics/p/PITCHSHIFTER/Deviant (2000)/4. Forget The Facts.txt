Forget the fact that you don't know me. 'Cause there's nothing that you wanna know. Forget the fact that you won't show me. 'Cause there's nothing that you wanna show. Forget the fact 
that I don't look like you. You keep singing "we don't change." Forget the fact this is nothing new.
Forget the violence, forget the pain. Our happy meals will taste the same. Forget the scandal, forget the sleaze. We'll drag the real thing to it's knees.
Forget the fact that I don't know you. When there's nothing I wanna know. Forget the fact that I won't go too. 'Cause there's nothing if I wanna go.. Forget the fact that this is nothing new. 
And then we'll smile as we devise a brand new peace prize. Cash Back euthanasia schemes, GM children, low fat dreams. Jerry Springer, crack cocaine, another black box, another 
plane. Instant access to friendly fire, plastic bullets, green barbed wire.
