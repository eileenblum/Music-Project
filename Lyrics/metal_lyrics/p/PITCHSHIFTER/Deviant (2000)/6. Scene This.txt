I bet you both, I bet you both -- you make the most. I set the scene, I set the scene -- I'll make you clean.
You can waste your time this time. Yes, you can waste your time not mine.
Because I'm never letting go. You know there's nothing else to be. I can't give up for you this time. You know I gotta set the scene.
I set you straight, I set you straight -- I take the bait. I set the scene, I set the scene -- I'll make you clean. I gotta set the scene, this.
