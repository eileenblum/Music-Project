Don't wann be the boy, the denizen, the chump change. I don't wanna be the next step. Don't wanna be the toy, the jettison, the chump change. I don't wanna be the first step. 'Cause we 
spet the last drop. 
Who decides if it's alright? I said, who decides if it's alright? Can't touch me, completely, reduction so easy. You can't touch me, not completely; your reduction is so easy. 
Don't wanna be the son, the citizen, the chump change. I don't wanna be the next step. Don't wanna be the same, the medicine, the chump change I don't wanna be the first up. 'Cause we 
spent the last drop. 
I wanna tell you this, I wanna make you dive. I wanna be the big fish; I wanna see you fry. Yeah, see you fry. Chump change. And I spent the last drop. Chump change.
