You may be the stronger now, but my time will come around. I said you may be the stronger now, but my time is coming round.
Taste it. Break it. I know you hate it. Take it, make it, I know you hate it.
I won't be much longer now, you hold tight I'm coming round. I said I won't be much longer now, you hold tight, I'm coming round.
And you can't keep it a secret, but you can keep it down. You know that no one really cares until it comes around.
You may be the stronger; you may be the stronger now.
