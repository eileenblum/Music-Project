Everything's fucked again -- Well those are harsh words my friend. Just tell me "some things never chane" -- Just tell me we're 2000. Everything's fucked again -- But go back to sleep my 
good friends. "You don't think they'd ever let us down?" -- "You don't think that we'd remember?" Everything's fucked again -- But don't let it get ya my friends. Just tell me it's the first 
time -- NO Tamagotchi headline. Everything's fucked again? -- But then what the hell would I know? It's just Millennial dementia -- Just my stupid magazines.
We got nothing to see -- We got nothing to do. We got nothing to take -- We got nothing to lose. And there's nothing we like -- And there's nothing we need. You got nothing to say -- 'cause 
I'm telling you everything's fucked.
Everything's fucked again -- Well these are dark days my friend. Just tell me all those pretty lies -- Protect me from the downsized. Everything's fucked again -- But we'll play out happy to 
the end. We'll all be paid in kind -- No contributions this time. But don't let it get you down, 'cause we'll put it back the next time. Just don't let it get you down.
