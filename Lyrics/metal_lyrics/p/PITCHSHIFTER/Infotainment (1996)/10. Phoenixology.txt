You say you've got to get away
But where are you going to go
Raise down, (dis) town
You've got to go, got to get away
There's something you should know (it's all the same)
No solutions, just consolations
Universal town (transposable location)
This town (this could be anywhere) this town (this could be everywhere)
You're desperation got it's place, you'll never beat this town
You'd love to shove it in their face, they'd love to drag you down
No solutions, just consolations
Universal town (transposable location)
This town (this could be anywhere) this town (this could be everywhere)
Still say you've got to get away? There's nowhere you can go
It's all the same, it's all the same old show
This town (this could be anywhere) this town (this could be everywhere)
This town (this could be anywhere) this town stretches over everything
