Victim (culture)
Targets (counter culture)
I've tried, I've failed; can't make your leap of faith
It's been all revealed
So don't lie to me because I can do it better
Don't tell me everything is 'gonna be ok'
Because it's blood, and it's sweat, saliva
Sucker (punch)
Bastards (last front)
So don't lie to me because I can do it better
Don't tell me everything is going to be ok
Because it's blood, and it's sweat, saliva
(Don't lie to me because I can do it better)
Don't tell me everything is 'gonna be ok'
Because it's blood, and it's sweat, saliva
