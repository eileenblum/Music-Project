Burn any bridge (break) I'll break any necks
Tell any lie, I hate all my friends
Kiss any feet (yes) I'll yes any sirs
Use any means, I'll do anything
Diseased 'suck-cess', individuality's a disability
Take any drug (twist) I'll twist any knife
Tell any lie, still hate all my friends
Stab any backs, (cut) I'll cut any ties
Use any means, I'll do anything
Diseased 'suck-cess', individuality's a disability
