Replicate, divide, mutate, survive
Tame? Beat. You hungry? Control tastes so sweet
Species? Walk tall, now show me the difference so small
Kill, eat, exploit the weak
It's freedom? That's choice. You listen because I hear no voice
Tested, still lives? Now tell me the strong will survive
Kill, eat, exploit the weak
(Can't build a chain from missing links)
Kill, eat, exploit the weak
