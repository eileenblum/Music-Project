Lie to me, tell me I'm like you
Tell me I'm beautiful, tell me I'm cool
Lie to me, patronise me
Talk to me 'like that' you know we like that
(I can see mass redundancies in your smile)
Tell me I'm perfect, ten feet high
Starve me, sedate me but feed the lie
Lie to me, patronise me
Talk to me 'like that' you know we like that
Tell me it's faultless, teflon child
Tell me there's nothing wrong (nothing wrong) stay press smile
Lie to me, keep patronising me
Talk to me 'like that' you know we like that
Lie to me, patronise me
Talk to me 'like that' you know we like that
(I can see mass redundancies in your smile)
Lie to me, (keep, keep) lying to me
(Keep, keep) talking to me 'like that' you know we like that
