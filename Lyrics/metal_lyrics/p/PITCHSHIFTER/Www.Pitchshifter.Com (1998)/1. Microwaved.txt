systematic abuse on a daily basis.
you're a racist (you don't know why?).
evidence of your intrusions, multiplied by my contusions.
you can't suture the future (though you might try).
because we're cut, dried, microwaved, safe in the knowledge that we'll all be
saved.
you say there's no black in the union jack but you can't give me a single
reason why.
I say there's no common wealth in the commonwealth 'cause it's the colour of
your money matters since the day the country died.
and don't you read the papers?
economics is gonna save us and "science never sleeps."
