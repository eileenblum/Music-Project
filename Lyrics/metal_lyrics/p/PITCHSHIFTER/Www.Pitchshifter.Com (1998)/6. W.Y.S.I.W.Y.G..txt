"God awful waste-of-space dumb degenerate low-life mal-adjusted freaks."
now I want just one day for things to go my way, low-life de-generation,
generation.
"got to know your place, dumb degenerate low-life, failure of the week."
if what you see is what you get then we have nothing to regret from all the
things I've seen.
and when there's nothing to regret our stupid lives we'll be better yet, at
least we'll all come clean.
