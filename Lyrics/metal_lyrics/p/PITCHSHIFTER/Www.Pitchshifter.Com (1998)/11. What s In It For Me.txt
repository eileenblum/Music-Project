I tried my best, did all that I can.
I don't think i've got a single thing left that i can call my own.
still at the end of the day when all's said and done, the one and only single
thing left is that one burning question.
what's in it for me?
('cause that's what really matters).
same as the rest?
convince me I am.
you don't need to burn the bridge in my head 'cause I'm out on my own...
what's in it for me, me, me?
('cause that's what really matters).
