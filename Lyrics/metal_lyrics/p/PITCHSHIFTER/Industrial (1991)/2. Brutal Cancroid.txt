Pictures with stagnant cancer, images of brutal man, vasecting, seething,
despising, beaten red faces extreme, run the streets, find the lame, red hands
grasp at the air, drowning faceless contests, propogating physical force.
Watch your thoughts drip from walls, injure, destroy. Watch your thoughts drip
from life to gratify, why? Onlooking innocent silence, naked mental violence,
forced to kneel in the gutter, displeasure confined to a room, if strength
were exchanged for weakness, your dominance for pain, would walls be built for
protection, or would your victims be named?
