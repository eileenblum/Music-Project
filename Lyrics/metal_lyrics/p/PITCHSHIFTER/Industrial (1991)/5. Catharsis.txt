Watching the hit, I feel calm, crying and blood, try smell harm, back I go
this mode of mind, you see me nice, you see me kind. My eyes strain, a blatant
stain, this bloody picture, failing to scare. Can't touch it, it goes through
me, can't feel the hit, all I do is see, the two sides of me, this square of
glass, watch from a distance, and let it all pass.
