If we were sanitised before your eyes super-clean
would you remember when I said "they're gonna getcha?"
Sooner later one way or another.
So let go, I said so.
Our time to shine - nothing's gonna stop us.
If you sit tight, we alright.
High times to climb - you know nothing's gonna stop us now.
Well this time we're taking sides gonna finish our final scenes
Do you remember when I said "I'm gonna get mine?"
Innovate/imitate oh what's the difference.
So let go, I said so.
Our time to shine - nothing's gonna stop us.
If you sit tight, we alright.
High times to climb - you know nothing's gonna stop us now.
And it's the appreciation of imitations so it seems
Do you remember when I said "they're gonna save us?"
Yes Sir, well I tried, it's now or never.
So let go, I said so.
Our time to shine - nothing's gonna stop us.
If you sit tight, we alright. High times to climb - you know nothing's gonna stop us now.
