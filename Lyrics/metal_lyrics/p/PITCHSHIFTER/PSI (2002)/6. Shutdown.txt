Was it something I said? But I don't even know you.
Was it something I did? If it was then just tell me.
If you show me no soul then you give me no reason.
Stand up straight when I walk, you can see me?
Kick all the dust that you want you know you're never gonna
Shut us down - we'll just get back up again.
If I gave you the tools could I temper my freedom?
If I suffered the fools would you let me succeed in
constructing my soul, should I give you the reason?
Stand up straight when I walk, you can see me?
Kick all the dust that you want you know you're never gonna
Shut us down - we'll just get back up again.
No matter what you say, we're gonna get back up again.
No matter what you do, we're gonna stand up straight again.
No matter what you say, we're gonna get back up again.
No matter what you do, we're gonna stand back up again.
And if you shut us down - we'll just get back up again.
