I took my time got myself degraded.
I close my eyes see you suffocating.
We took our chances well it's always a start.
Look at our faces tell me
We're not sleeping, not sedation.
Misdirection, overrated.
I set the fire while you demonstrated
I close my eyes 'cause it's so frustrating
I wanna touch it but it's always the same
We're not sleeping, not sedation.
Misdirection, overrated.
I took my time. I closed my eyes.
We took our chances. Look at our faces tell me
We're not sleeping, not sedation.
Misdirection, overrated.
