You knock me down take the shirt from our backs,
kick me round but you will never stop me,
drag me down take the words from my mouth,
kick me round round but you will never stop me.
He said no man could ask for better sons
and after all the things I've said and done.
He said he carries us both deep within his heart.
What if my kind afraid to try?
You knock me down take the shirt from our backs,
kick me round but you will never stop me,
drag me down take the words from my mouth,
kick me round round but you will never stop me.
And it's the selling of the setting sun
that let's me know our work has just begun.
You know we'll never erase it it's gone too far.
What if my kind afraid to try?
You knock me down take the shirt from our backs,
kick me round but you will never stop me,
drag me down take the words from my mouth,
kick me round round but you will never stop me.
