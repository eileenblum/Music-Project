You can't touch this dream, you can't make this scene.
"You can't change a thing" watch me, watch me, watch me,
turn things round, you can't make this sound
"We can't change a thing?" watch me, watch me, watch me.
And I'd like to rise above you.
And I'd like to see you falling
Down, feeling nothing.
Down. Your feeling is nothing.
You can't light this fuse, we're not safe to choose.
"You can't make a stand?" watch me, watch me, watch me.
Can't burn the pages, it's not sent in stages.
"You can't change a thing?" watch me, watch me, watch me.
And I'd like to rise above you.
And I'd like to see you falling
Down, feeling nothing.
Down. Your feeling is nothing.
And I'd like to see you falling
Down, feeling nothing.
Down. Your feeling is nothing.
