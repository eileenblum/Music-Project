Eight days of the week can't believe my eyes.
Insurrection in the streets so we stay inside.
Go, it's coming.
Eight days of the week we're dead on our feet,
take me aside just shoot me.
No black and white, black and white,
wish we could drive right through you.
Tired of wishing things were different I can sympathise.
Lately things don't seem so easy there's no black and white.
Go, it's coming.
Eight days of the week we're dead on our feet,
take me aside just shoot me.
No black and white, black and white,
wish we could drive right through you.
