I slip when eat, I slip when I slip.
Fall down to my knees I slip when I seem.
I slip when I see you, kick when I fall through,
I slip when I seem, I slip when I
See you coming step aside (you step aside)
And I slip when I see you coming every time (it's every time)
I slip when I need, I slip when I feed.
Emphatic disease I slip when I seem.
I slip through the meaning, tripped on the feeling.
I slip when I seem, I slip when I
See you coming step aside (you step aside)
And I slip when I see you coming every time (it's every time)
It's every time you do what's right, 
you step aside - I said you kick it.
You can't break us don't waste your time,
Keep myself in a modern mind.
You can't take us to severed scenes,
Kill yourself on the medicines.
And I slip when I see you coming step aside (you step aside)
And I slip when I see you coming every time (it's every time)
