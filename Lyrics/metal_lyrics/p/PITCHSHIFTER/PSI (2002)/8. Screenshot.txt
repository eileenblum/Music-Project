Can't see the matches, woods are too full of trees.
Can't make the distance 'cause it's difficult to breath.
Keep burning bridges but the stakes just get higher,
I said the emancipation is just fuel for the fire.
You know it's alright if it's alright.
We can break it on our own if you'll just give us time.
It's alright if it's alright.
We can burn all our bridges it'll be just fine,
if you'll just give us time.
Can't walk the pavement carbon's choking the streets.
Can't make the rent because we're burning CD's.
Keep stealing time but then the rates just get higher.
I said the incriminations are just fuel for the fire.
You know it's alright if it's alright.
We can break it on our own if you'll just give us time.
It's alright if it's alright.
We can burn all our bridges it'll be just fine,
if you'll just give us time, well it'll be just fine.
We don't lie and we don't lie, no we don't lie.
We don't lie and we don't lie, no we don't lie down.
You know it's alright if it's alright.
We can break it on our own if you'll just give us time.
It's alright if it's alright.
We can burn all our bridges it'll be just fine,
if you'll just give us time, well it'll be just fine.
