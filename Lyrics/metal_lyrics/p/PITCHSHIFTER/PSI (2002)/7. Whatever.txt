We got sanitised for the plastic dream.
It's the best 'no sell-out' that you've ever seen.
Another dead man walking in the cash machine.
Never lost sight of the holy green, oh no.
A big business to bleed, down on your knees.
Something to see well you said it, whatever.
You keep dropping the tone.
Another snap-shot winner on the silver screen.
It's the best no talent that you've ever seen,
and if I said I'm not sorry would you know what mean?
Never lost sight of the holy green, oh no.
A big business to bleed, down on your knees.
Something to see, well you said it, whatever.
You keep dropping the tone.
More winners to save, a 'c' on your grave
Nothing's for free, well you said it, whatever.
Well you're never alone.
