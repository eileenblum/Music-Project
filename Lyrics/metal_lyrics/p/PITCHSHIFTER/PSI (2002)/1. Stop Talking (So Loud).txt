Reflecting my time, not wasting a second,
forget 'what it takes' 'cause you can't keep us down.
Exceptions aside, a favourite obsession,
you're wasting your time if you don't make a sound.
Keep making mistakes, deflecting the pressure
Stop talking so loud, I can hear what you're saying
is what you're saying.
Hold on for the ride, abuse and oppression,
a small price to pay to be the land of the free.
keep watching the skies, it's some kind of Escher
Stop talking so loud, I can hear what you're saying
Is what you're saying.
Sometimes we all say stupid things among our sins.
We're taking our time, not wasting a second
Stop talking so loud, I can hear what you're saying
is what you're saying.
