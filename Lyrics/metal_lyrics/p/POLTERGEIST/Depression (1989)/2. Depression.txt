Deep inside it sleeps
Time is all it needs
Rising from your soul
This feeling will take control
Thinkin' 'bout suicide
The preacher says "this is not right"
But everything is going wrong
You can't change, you're not strong

Come, here is the gun
Come on give in
To your obsession
Now, if you are strong
You'll pull the trigger
For your depression...

May be the other life will come
May be there's nothing and you were wrong
May be there is heaven mey be there is hell
May be there is nothing and you have failed

Pull the trigger - shoot yourself
Take the pills and poison yourself

You think this is just a dream
Soon you'll realize this is real
You have to act, you can't wait
Try to get out, it's too late...

Thinking about suicide
The preacher says "This is not right"
But everything is going wrong
You cannot change, you're so strong

Come, here is your gun
Come and give in
To your obsession
Now, if you are stonrg
You'll pull the trigger
For your depression...
