From the beginning, you had no chance
You had no aid, no helping hand
Just hate and pain was all you've learned
You never asked, never said one word

Someday you will
Pay back what you endured
Then they will see
You have found your cure

They say you have to do what they want
You're under your parents command
No way to realize your ideas
They do not even see your tears

Poor me
Is what you think
Fuck you
Is what you say to them when you're
Grown up...

When you'll get a family
Your own children
They will see
What you've learned from mum and dad
You will make them bend to your will

Stop getting at me
Don't want to do
The things that you teached me

I
I just feel like
I'm back at home
I never be free

Show
You've learned your lesson
A lesson of hate and pain

You
You've got no choice
Just always do the same
