Let me tell
A little tale
About a fanatic race

They were guided
By just one man
He led them in disgrace

Trouble came across the land
Some knew there's something wrong
Many man already died
Now see what they had done

The hate grew up
And every jew
Began to hide and run

Protection was escape from here
They're killing just for fun

Some could flee
Some could hide
Six millions died

They couldn't flee
From gas and guns
The aryan race was proud
Prophet

He was the one who helped them all
He led the revolte against the walls
He had a vision of their escape
He saw his death and Europe's fate

Prophet

[Inspired by the book "Treblinka" from J.F.Steiner]
