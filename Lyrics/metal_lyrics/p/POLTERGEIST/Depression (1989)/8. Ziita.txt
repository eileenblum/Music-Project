Obsessed by an idea of love
You know it's a sudden death

Don't care what all the legends say
She's taking last breath

See her smiling
She;s fine
Feel her twisting
Your mind

Now she turns show her face
You will kill the things you've praised

Imagination that's all misery
Just can't believe this is real witchery
