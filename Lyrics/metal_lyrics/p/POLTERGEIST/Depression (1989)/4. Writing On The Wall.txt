You see the fire
It's burning bright
The pungent smoke comes near

Turn up the radio
And listen  to
Don't know what's happening here

They say "Don't Fear"
It's so harmless
Everything is under control

Just close your windows
And go to sleep
Tomorrow it's all over

See
See the writing on the wall

Read
Read the answers to your calls

Tschernobyl in Russia
Don't get scared, it's so far
Radiation is not so high

Schweizerhalle in Switzerland
Just a little fire man
Panic? No, I ask you why

They are poisoning our water
Creatures die, it doesn't matter
It's so sad that they can't cry

Chemistry in our food
Never eat, don't be a fool
If you do, you surely die

Just a mistake
Not so bad
But these people
They will die

Contermination
A new disaster
They all do what they want

You feel the panic
It's creeping near
They sure would have their fun

They feel important
We are just scum
In their eyes we're all fools

See
See the writing on the wall

Read
Read the answers to your calls

You must strike back
With your own mind
You've got to defend your life

Never give up
Don't let them win
Everyone want to survive

You try to stop them
Without success
You can't do anything alone

But all together
We have got a chance
Together we are strong

See
See the writing on the wall

Read
Read the answers to your calls

"Dedicated to all the creatures who died
Because of the chemical disaster in Schweizerhalle Basel I.II.1986..."
