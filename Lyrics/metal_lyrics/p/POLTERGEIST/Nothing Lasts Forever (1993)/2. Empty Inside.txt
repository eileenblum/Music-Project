Feeling lonely in your room
Dreaming of better life for you
Waiting for the night to come
This time the nightmare will come true
You hear this voice again
Tells you the things you have to do
Never trust to anyone
You're all alone
You and your twisted mind
never leave your friend alone
Last thing you own
You feel so empty inside
Everything's so easy
If you listen inside
Everything you needed
You will get tonight
Take what you wanna take
He said it's all right
Do what you wanna do
You're gonna win this fight
Do they all think you're insane
You try to tell them who's to blame
What you have done is not your fault
It's just the voice without a name
But when you're all aloneThe voice returns
It starts again
Never trust to anyone
You're all alone
You and your twisted mind
Never leave your friend alone
Last thing you own
You feel so empty inside
