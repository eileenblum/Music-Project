I never ask questions
I just do it right
I live my life under the law
My life is not senseless
I know what to do
They told me what I'm living for
Conscience
I never heard an inner voice
I'm just doin' my job
Justice
I'm doin' what they've told me to do
I'm just doin' my job
I never worry
Never feel bad
Everything's under control
There are just the rules
I have to follow
And nothing will ever be wrong
Conscience
I never heard an inner voice
I'm just doin' my job
Justice
I'm doin' what they've told me to do
I'm just doin' my job
Sorrows
I never heard about this word
I'm just doin' my job
Useless
Is what I think about you
I'm just doin' my job
I never will change my opinion
The law sais what's wrong and what's right
I never will lose
You're never the winner
Sometime you will break, we've got time
No chance for you, no chance for anyone
Surrender before it's too late
No chance for me or a decision
I'm doin' my job, it's my will
I never made mistakes
And I never will
'Cos I've got the law on my side
I'll never worry
About good and bad
My gun and my badge are my pride
Conscience
I never heard an inner voice
I'm just doin' my job
Sorrows
I never heard about this word
I'm just doin' my job
Useless
Is what I think about you
I'm just doin' my job
Follow the blind
It's so easy as it seems
Forget all your mind
Come and live with us in our dream
Everything's fine
Never lose the faith in our vision
Keep your nose to the grind
Never try to make your own decisions
What happened to me
Am I still free
I never will be
Forget all your doubts
Come to us
We have the key
We know all about
Life and what it means
So many have tried
To defy the way which we are praying
Our system is right
It's a lie (when) they say the Earth is dying...
