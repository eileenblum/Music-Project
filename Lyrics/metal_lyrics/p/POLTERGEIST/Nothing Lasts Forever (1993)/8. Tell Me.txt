Why don't you fit in our system
Is what they pray
Cut your hair
Be one of us
Is what they say
No indiduality
Just all the same
Show no more colours
It has to be just dark and grey
Tell me people who are you
To tell me what to do
Did you ever tell the truth
Or did you ever move
Hunger, pain and misery
Is what to give my friends
Who will be responsible
If there will be an end
You'll never accept the way I look
'cos there's just yours
You don't try to understand my words
You stop before
So don't you try to change me
It's not the way for me
Don't want your system and your rules
Last thing I need
Tell me people who are you
To tell me what to do
Did youever tell the truth
Or did you ever move
Hunger, pain and misery
Is what you give my friends
Who will be responsible
If there will be an end
Life is a mystery
You don't know about
In fact you're not living free
Why don't you break out
Life is a mystery
You cannot deny
Why don't you just listen to me
You don't even try
Tell me people who are you
To tell me what to do
Did you ever tell the truth
Or did you ever move
Hunger, pain and mysery
Is what you give my friends
Who will be responsible
If there will be an end
Life is a mystery
You don't know about
In fact you're not living free
Why don't you break out
