Everyday you watch the V screen
You never miss a show
You know what I mean
The main thing for you
We know it all
Is to watch the phone and wait to call
You know it
The answer
Wrong number
Bad luck
Maybe next time...
You've got no friends just you and your shows
You stay at home
That's how it goes
You need nobody to feel good
Don't even know your neighbourhood

[Chorus:]
Stop
Stop living for the game
No
Don't turn the TV on
Don't do the same
Stop
Stop living for the games
No
Don't be a number without a name

So now it's time to turn it on
You see the prizes they have won
You'll never face reality
You'll never get the chance to win
You know it
The answer
Wrong numbers
Bad luck
Maybe next time
You are the master of all games
Know all the numbers and all the names
No one can beat you
Oh not you
You are the best
You think it's true

[Chorus:]
Stop
Stop living for the game
No
Don't turn the TV on
Don't do the same
Stop
Stop living for the games
No
Don't be a number without a name

You'd give everything to win the prize
Once in your life
To be the star
You know the answer
Sure you are the one
This is not fair
The prize is gone
So now you're waiting for your time to come
They soon will see who you are
There's just the will to beat them all
Then you can proof who's the star
