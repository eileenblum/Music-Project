Rainy day, a sky as grey as the sea
Sittin' here
Waitin' for you to call me
Home alone as lonely as I wanteed to be
But loneliness is not the only thing that I need
Ask myself what's going wrong
Just don't know where I belong
Never again
I wouldn't ever do it again
Never again
I wouldn't ever do it the same way
Not another chance for me
To live my life again
But I think it is allright
All the things I didn't say
Always took the wrong way
Now I have to pay
I see my face starrin' at me off the wall
I see my friends tryin' to catch my fall
Ask myself what's going wrong
Just don't know where I beloong
Never again
I wouldn't ever do it again
Never again
I woudn't ever do it the same way
But in the end they couldn't help me at all
And no one's there to listen my call
