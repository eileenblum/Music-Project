You tell me my future
My fate in your eyes
Mususing my chastity
You master of disguise
When will I find an answer
You darken my mind
When will I find the exit
Into the other side
But you darken my mind
You sell the key
The prize is me
My soul and all my destiny
You harvest your victims
Give'em no chance
You harvest your seed of anger
Taking command
When will I find an answer
You darken my mind
When will I find the exit
Into ther other side
Why did I listen
Why did I pray
Why did I touch the evil
Now it's too late
Surrounded by dearkness
Seems like I'm blind
Visions of sadness
Drive me insane
But you darken my mind
You sell the key
The prize is me
My soul and all my destiny
Now you possess me
Your spirit is mine
Erased all my thoughts and memories
You're more than my guide
Never will find an answer
You darken my mind
Never will find the exit
There's no other side
I'm on the run
Knife in my hand
Now I've fullfilled your wishes
I ripped her flesh
Red dreams came true
Her blood felt like wet, warm kisses
I'm on the loose
I'll get my fun
Loving the fear in their eyes
I kill for you
I die for you...
