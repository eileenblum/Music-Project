When they told you all the lies
About the evil enemy
You didn't doubt a single word
So you went for them to war
One single bullet broke your back
Paralysis is now your curse
Now you remember the day
When you alked out the door
You've seen this procession
of victims and cripples of war
And you've never have seen in your life a spastic before
You've seen you future
Right in his eyes
Why can't you turn back the time
You've seen your future
You
Didn't realize
Now it's too late to lie
Now you live your life in agony
You have lost your legs forever
Another victim for another senseless war
Will we ever learn to live together?
When they told you all the lies
About the evil enemy
You didn't doubt a single word
Now you remember the day
When you walked out the door
You've seen the procession
Of victims and cripples of war
And you've never have seen
In your
life a spastic before
You've seen your future
Right in his eyes
Why can't you turn back the time
You've seen your future
You
Didn't realize
Now it's too late
