Nothing lasts forever
No one knows the truth
Come and face reality
It will be better for you
Nothing lasts forever
Pain and misery
Soon it's getting better
Don't stop until you're free
Remember there are two sides
Of each and everything that you can see and you can feel
Remember day and night
Without a day the night would mean just death to you and me
Can't you see
Nothing
Lasts Forever
Walls
Can tumble down
No one
Is immortal
Rules
They change somehow
Sorrows
Come and go
Time
Is passing by
Feelings
Try to show you
Ways
To live your life
Can't you stop to worry
About those things which happen just to you
Only you
You always try to hurry
You've got the time to wait
until you're through oh you do
Nothing
Lasts forever
Walls
Can tumble down
No one is immortal
Rules
They change somehow
Sorrows
Come and go
Time
Is passing by
Feelings
Try to show you
Ways
To live your life
Nothing lasts forever
No one knows the truth
Come and face reality
It will be better for you
Nothing lasts forever
Pain and misery
Soon it's getting better
Don't stop until you're free
Did you find your way now
Did you see the way for you and me
Oh did you see
There is no solution
For those of us who only work for greed
That's how it seems
Nothing
Lasts forever
Walls
Can tumble down
No one
Is immortal
Rules
They change somehow
Sorrows
Come and go
Time
is passing by
Feelings Try to show you
Ways
To live your life
Nothing lasts forever
No one knows the truth
Come and face reality
It will better for you
Nothing lasts forever
Pain and misery
Soon it's getting better
Don't stop until your free
