You had the best of life
Your dreams they all came true
You've reached everything
Everything that man can do
You kept your promises
Never you have failed
If something was not right
Your money swept it away
You've been around this world
You've been in every place
You have seen things which most the people never face
Sometimes you ask yourself
Are they all really friends
Is it just your money
Will they stand by you in the end
Imagine this my friend
If world would change a bit
No money and no gold
Nothing you can buy with it
What would you do my friend
If nothing would be the same
Who will remember you
If only you remain...
You can't believe the truth
Your perfect world won't break
You pull the trigger
Without a moment's hesitate
One day you'll see
There's nothing left for you to buy
And everything you own
Won't help you when you die
Imagine this my friend
If world would change a bit
No money and no gold
Nothing you can buy with it
What would you do my friend
If nothing be the same
Who will remember you
If only you remain
Why don't you try to change it
Seek a better way for you
Never try to buy a friend
Just one thing you could do
Someday you'll find the answer
For you to live your life
You will pay back your dues
Someday you'll break the ice
Imagine this my friend
If world would change a bit
No money and no gold
Nothing you can buy with it
What would you do my friend
If nothing would be the same
Who will remember you
If only you remain...
You have to face it
All your money's nothing worth
Friends turn to enemies
You will get what you deserve
Maybe you don't care about
Don't give a fuck.
You're doin' well
Look into my gun and close your eyes
See you in Hell...
