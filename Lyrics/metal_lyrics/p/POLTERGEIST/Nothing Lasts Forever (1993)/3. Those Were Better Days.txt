Everyday
You've got the same question
You know it is a problem for you
You don't need
An excuse for growing older
But memories can be so cruel
Forever
You see the truth
Now face to face
Remember
The luck in all those days
Life's getting cold and colder
But those were better days
You're growing older and older
Now those were better days
Your past
Is getting clear and clearer
From now on you'll remember this
What you say
Is not what you are thinking
Don't imitate the things you miss
For ever
You see the truth
Now face to face
Remember
The luck in all those days
Life's getting cold and colder
But those were better days
You're growing old and older
Now those were better days
Face it
You can't bring back these times
You know
This is the past
Try now
To do the best with it
Believe me
It will be a progress
It's hard
Compared to all the good times
It's hard to get all over this
You know
Those days will never get back
This is the life
That's how it is
For ever
You see the truth now face to face
Remember
The luck in all those days
Life's getting cold and colder
But those were better days
You're growing old and older
Now those were better days
