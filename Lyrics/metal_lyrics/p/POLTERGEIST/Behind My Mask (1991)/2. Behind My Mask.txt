Can't you see
My eyes are burning
They're fire and pain
And they show me the world so unreal

Can't you see
My mind is running
I'm almost insane
Nothing makes sense to me

Can't you hear
My mind is crying
Crying for help
Why doesn't nobody hear me

I feel
So alone now
They're watching my face
But a mask is all what they see

[Chorus:]
Behind my mask
You can see all my fears
Behind my mask
You can see all my tears
Behind my mask
You can see my real face
Behind my mask
You can see my disgrace

Don't talk to me
I can't understand all your words
Don't bother me
Just leave me under my curse

Fly with me
I'm heading to my inner skies
Just wait and see
I'm not at home, look in my eyes

Can't you see
My eyes are burning
They're fire and pain
And they show me the world so unreal

Can't you see
My mind is running
I'm almost insane
Nothing makes sense to me

[Chorus]

Too much stuff
Too much for me
Everything turns upside down

I'm feeling bad
So sick and tired
Everything's dancing around

Don't trust my face
My starry eyes
I can't control my inner self

Is this the end
Or just a rest
I'm under the drug's evil spell
