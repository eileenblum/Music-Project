In the streets, ther's your life
The only place you rule
Here you're a king
No one else can be

You know the rules of this game
And you know it is all true
he strong survives
And the weak will die

There's no one else harder than you
There's none as cruel as you
The harder you get
The higher you get

Only violence rules the street
There's no place here for love
Don't trust your friends
It will be your end

You can hide all your feelings
But you never will stay the same
You may think this is life
But someday you will see who's to blame

Committing a new act of violence

Now again
You played your game
A few more on your list
How many more
Will have to die

Will it stop now
Is it enough
Or do you need some more
More begging for mercy, more cries of pain

You can hide all your feelings
But you never will stay the same
You may think this is life
But someday you will see who's to blame

Commiting a new act of violence

The day has come for you
To feel what is pain
They beat you up my friend
again and again

You were so stupid
When you thought this is cool
Now you're the victim, man
So now who's the fool?

Now you pay
For the things which you've done
Of course this is not fair
Four against one

But you know
All the rules in the street
Only the strong survives
This time it's me

(Why you're crying, man?
Does it hurt so bad?
You're dying, man
Oh, it's so sad)

You can hide all your feelings
But you never will stay the same
You may think this is life
But someday you will see who's to blame

Committing a new act of violence
