You ask your dad
Why you have to stay at home
Everyday the same old staffy room

He tells you the same old story
If you go out you'll be sick tonight
Then he starts to talk about it
The days when everything was allright

The sky was blue and bright
Not dark and grey
The air was clear
And you could go out to play
There were green hills and flowers
No buildings and no toxic power
The sea was full of life
No plastic bags and no pools of oil

[Spoken verse:]
Mankind destroyin' it's home
The greed has taken the world by storm
Without any consideration
It teaches man to kill the planet
Which he is living on
Soon there will be no more chance
For him
And he has to lie in his
Self digged grave...

You ask yourself
Who is responsible
Who had the right
To steal your life

You are not guilty
When you were born it was all too late
Look out of your window
And ask this big grey sky about your fate
