Is this the way I'm leaving
This cruel awful world

I feel how death is creeping
Inside every nerve

I can feel my mind is floating
My body lies there
I'm heading for the light
And I'm driftin' away

I'm driftin' away
Oh driftin' away

All the pain is getting smaller
The higher I get
I can hear the voices calling
There's nothing I regret

I'm driftin' away
Oh I'm driftin' away
