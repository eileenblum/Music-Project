Look inside your soul
And find the blackest part
Unfeeling and uncaring and cold
Then you have a feeling of my soul
I embraced darkness
As soon as I was born
Pushing out love
Inside my soul
My eyes see red
From heartbreak and pain
And painful visions
Inside my head
Pain takes the place of pleasure
Inside me is anger
No place for pleasure
Awaiting revenge at any measure
