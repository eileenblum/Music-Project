Red river flowing
Wounds tearing open
The blade of a knife
Release my cares from me
Knife now blood stained..
Not a care no more
Tragic life
Meaningless times
I lost it all
âHey Waitâ
You say
âThat looks like bloodâ
But no! Itâs the pain inside
Finally released
Let go, to leave this place
To play at someone else
Not me! No more
The perfect world
Out of reach
Except one way
The way itâs troooooo
