A creature
Clad in tatters of dead joy
Bleeding
The red of the holly berries
And crowned
With their spiky leaves
By the light of the sun
Iâm running through
Failing my search
When did my strenght fail?
Seeing the sun die
Year after year
Thereâs nothing new
Getâs ready now
To terrorize
So pure I am
Where I bleed
Shreds of fate
Given life
By my fierce scream
I am mad
(And some black metal rubbish)
