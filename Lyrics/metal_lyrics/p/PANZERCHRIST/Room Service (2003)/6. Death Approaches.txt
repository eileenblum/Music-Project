So, why didnât I see you coming?
In my breath, In my walk, In my eyes
You have been there for long and long
I saw you and recognized you
For what you were
Screamed at
Run from
And I thought I had accepted that
And itâs only someone that Iâve fought with
For these many years
Always there
Always waiting
We have our differences
Death and me
But we are so similar
So very alike
Two stiffs in a village
Always comes to blows
But youâre here now
And come between me
Me and my life
