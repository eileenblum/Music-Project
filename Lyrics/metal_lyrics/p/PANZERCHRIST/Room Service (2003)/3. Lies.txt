I am truth
But itâs killing me
Mankind cannot bear too much
But I am a man and the truth is all I can bear
And the lies and lies and lies are killing me
Great deceptions
You talk the talk
But are you there?
False receptions
The ultimate
In failure and fear
Lies and lies and lies and lies
Iâm so fucked in the head
Itâs not funny
And the love of my life
Canât save me
Because
I have to save myself first
My son
We must prevale
Go get daddyâs gun
Weâll make a call for hell
Not for me
While I stare at the cold moon
Ironic
That something so clean
For the staining blood
That will splat at me
For the secret that it is
