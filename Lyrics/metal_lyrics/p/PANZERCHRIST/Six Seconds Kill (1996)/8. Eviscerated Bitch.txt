Bitch can you feel the itch
Sickness in your mind
Pain in your eyes
Hatred from the past

Demons feast upon the dead
Fills you up with insanity
Demons breathe upon your neck
Now your time has come
You can't escape your past

Bitch, your time has come now
Your lies will end now
And so will you
Through your blood-soaked eyes
I will cut you in two

Bitch your time is gone now
Eviscerated
Eviscarated

What a relief
That you're out of my life
But now I have this "thing"
I could do it again...

Bitch, your life has left you
