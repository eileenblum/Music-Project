A storm is coming
And I wonder if it will be the last
But we still have to move
We have some killing to do
But winds are getting colder
And soon winter begins

Then the demons will come
And death will be our release

I feel the cold now
I see the end now
The last phase of war begins
And on the soulside of the eastfront
Life seems to end

We can't hold this front no longer
And surrender is irrelevant
So we must dig in
And on the soulside
Frost takes our lives

It's so cold now
It's so cold
