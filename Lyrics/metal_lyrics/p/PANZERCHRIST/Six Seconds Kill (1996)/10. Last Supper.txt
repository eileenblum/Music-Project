We sit aone here you and I
And when I look into your eyes
I find the emptiness
In the dark of them
And I cry for you
I cry for you

So you think there is a God
And life is a fairytale
Look around you
Do you think he would create
A world of shit

So you say I am losing my faith
But the only thing I've lost is you
You're too dull to dream
And it makes me think
What if life is just others fantasy
