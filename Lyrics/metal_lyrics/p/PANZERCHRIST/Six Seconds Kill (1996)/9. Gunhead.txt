Come be with me
And save yourself
Don't know it's all
In your head

Release your mind
And save your...
Kill yourself and save your soul

This darkened place
You have to leave

So come with me
I will save your...
Now kill yourself
And save your soul

It's all inside of you
Search your inner self
And you will know
This is the way to go

Gunhead, now this is the end
Release yourself
And let your head go

Gunhead you have found peace
In another time
Your mind is free
