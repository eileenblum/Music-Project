Steel trust iron dreams
Metal taste in my mouth
Solid wheels, burnt flesh
Thank you, friend, for I can see

Panzer
Christ

My demon friend
You have awakened me
Your lust for war
Jave now set me free

Panzer
Christ

The time is near
For their salvation
They will be set free
With my warmachine
There can be no escape
From my friend and I
