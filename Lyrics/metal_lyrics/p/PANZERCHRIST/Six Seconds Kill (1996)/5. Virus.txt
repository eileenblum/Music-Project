Your blood in your vein
Becoming back
No time left

And now your body dies
Blood flows out of open cracks
In your skin
Leaving you just time to think
What you have done wrong
And you're not comfortably numb

And so the final process sets in
No God, no religion
Can save you now

And the feeling's gone
And you have become part of it

But don't worry,
It's only nature's
Revenge!
