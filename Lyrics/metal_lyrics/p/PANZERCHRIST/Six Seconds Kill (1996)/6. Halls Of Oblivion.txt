When the gates
Behind one closes
Life ends...
And only dreams are left

What I was I am no longer
In this eternal darkness

Then I hear their whispers
Tormented hymns
Souls without hope
Waiting, for their impending doom
Waiting, for their Lord
Spirit without peace

When eternity suffocate our hopes
Then the gates will open again
To a world in his power

We are now his demons for war
We chose darkness, now we are the Gods

The dream is gone and life has started
Waiting, for his command
Waiting, for the spirit
Spirit without peace
