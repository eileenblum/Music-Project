So this is it
There's no way back
I'm closing in
Breathing down your back
You can't escape me now
So use that last chance of yours
And run for me
Run to me
And I shall cut you down
And I wil take your soul

You make me laugh
This - your final call
Too late to save your ass
And now you're going down
So use that chance of yours
Run for me
Run to me
And I will kill you all
And I will have your souls

It's the smell of your blood
That makes me go insane
Helps me lose all my hatred
Makes me love this war again
And again
Frontlines is what I live for
I wish it will never end
The smell of blood
And game
