I will fill you up
Make you bleed
Make you pay
The led makes the hate go away

I can't help myself
In this rotting place
I need to place myself
So I reload again

Reload again
Lifting stones from my heart
I am your sunshine
Your heartstopper!

Now I am coming for you
Don't try to fight it back
My final dream
Missile Seeking Termination
And total domination
