Church of Christ breeding hate, the flame of hell shall rise
Satan's force rains from the throne to slay the priest of lies
1,000 years was bound by chain, Satanus seeks revenge
Burning flame, the Antichrist - no mercy, no repent

Lightning strikes the knell of death, panic runs below
Holy priest, he prays in vain, the winds of death now blow
Flame of the Panzerchrist

Satan's troops they march from hell, the resurrected dead
Church of Christ lay under siege, the flame of death burns red
Demons slay the king of kings, destroy this holy shrine
Bow to me the Panzerchrist, the house of god is mine

Lightning strikes the knell of death, panic runs below
Holy priest, he prays in vain, the winds of death now blow
Flame of the Panzerchrist

In sacred tongue they try to fight, Satan holds the force
Wind and flame exerting death, destruction of the cross
Spirits scream with chants of doom, Lucifer has come
Distant hopes the heavens fall, in hell thy will be done

Lightning strikes the knell of death, panic runs below
Holy priest, he prays in vain, the winds of death now blow
Flame of the Panzer...
Christ, thy name is Panzer
