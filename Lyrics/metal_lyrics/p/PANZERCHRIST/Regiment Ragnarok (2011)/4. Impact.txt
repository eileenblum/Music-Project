Brace for the impact
Screaming through the air like harpies
Beautiful shells of destruction
Projectiles strike their targets

The payloads arrive as the fools duck and cower
Tactical advance begins within the hour
Friends try to save those torn apart
Angel come howling: "Now you shall part."

The torrent of steel approaches
Cold fear runs rampart
The payloads arrive as the fools duck and cower

Tactical advance begins within the hour
Their friends try to save those torn apart
The barrage is the finest art

They cut and run
Saving their own hides
Our work is done
The far, distant might

They shatter the still
They howl until
A thousand pounds worth
Shatters the earth

Driving with adamant power
They eat the iron rations
They cut and run, saving their own hides
Our work is done, the far, the distant might

We advance through smoking ruins
Your death is our doing
