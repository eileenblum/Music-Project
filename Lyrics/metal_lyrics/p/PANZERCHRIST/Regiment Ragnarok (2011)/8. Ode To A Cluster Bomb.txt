She spreads herself upon before me
She covers me, we scream in unison

Amidst the turmoil she came to me
And gave me a glimpse of elegance
Her beauty struck me down and I shall never rise
Forever I am her's and everything dies

So fall upon me, rise beyond me
Pierce me; let me see what lives inside you
Slowly open yourself, let me look inside
Let me see within your hide

What strange world is this?
I long only for her kiss

Fly to me, I hunger for thee
To feel the warmth of your body of steel
Your requiem is the finest song
And we are right where we belong

And we discharge and we explode
And in that moment we're torn apart
And I know that I have gazed at
Eternity itself
