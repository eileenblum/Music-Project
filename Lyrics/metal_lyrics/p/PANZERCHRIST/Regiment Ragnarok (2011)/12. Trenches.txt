Waiting for what seems like forever
We've stayed in this place so long
No movement, no changes
We wait for our salvation

Deep in foregin lands we wait
Conflict is a standstill
In the trenches day and night
Waiting for the push

No ground is given, nothing ever changes
And we're waiting for the panzer
To liberate us, to set us free
To end life in the trenches

Waiting for what seems like forever
We've stayed in this place so long
No movement, no changes
We wait for our salvation

Mustard gas is launched
And we prepare for the assault
Another hundred dead
And we're waiting for the push

No ground is given, nothing ever changes
And we're waiting for the panzer
To liberate us, to set us free
To end life in the trenches
