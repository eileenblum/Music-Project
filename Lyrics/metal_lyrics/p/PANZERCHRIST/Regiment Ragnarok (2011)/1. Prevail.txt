Anann show me their weakness
So I best know how to kill them
Horus give me strength to stand
When all around me burns

Nemian let terror drown their minds
See their ranks falter
Mars tell me what they adore
So I know of what to rob them

Tyr imbue my spirit
Guide my bullets into their hearts
Camulus fill up my senses
To taste their blood, to smell their fear

Bellona fuel my bloodlust
See that I shall tear them apart
Victoria grant me what you seek
Valour guide me to prevail
