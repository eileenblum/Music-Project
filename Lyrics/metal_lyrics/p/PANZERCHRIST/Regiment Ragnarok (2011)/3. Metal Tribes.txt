When northern tribes are clad in metal hides
The world will tremble in horror
When longships fire on your coastal guard
You will know the meaning of terror
When thousands of berserkers run amok
Your homelands to devour

The banging of shields is the panzer steel
We come at you with religious zeal

The fiercest army ever known to man
You will know how it began
When the pride of the North is on the march
No one is safe

When our ballistae shoot ICBM's
Your defenses are crumbling
When we come you will wish for the end
And we will grant it, we ascend

Run for your lives
The eastern coast is lost
The Northmen have come with fire and frost
Now comes the armour

In times of old we pillaged and raped
Stormed Canterbury
Now we come to finish the task
Armed with guns and fury
And we advance across the Isles
To build an empire anew

The banging of shields is the panzer steel
We come at you with religious zeal
The fiercest army ever known to man
You will know how it began
When the pride of the North is on the march

No one is safe
When our ballistae shoot ICBM's
Your defenses are crumbling
When we come you will wish for the end
And we will grant it, we ascend

Run for your lives
The eastern coast is lost
The Northmen have come
With fire and frost

Now comes the armour
Armed with infinite rage
And now we enter a new age
Panzer Division - engage
