I burn with the fires of Hell
I pull you towards where the bombs fell
Through narrow streets I drag you
Towards the centre of the storm

I engulf you, I suck you in
You cannot sate my hunger, watch me grin
Through narrow streets I drag you
Towards the centre of the storm

As Hamburg burns
Dresden burns
London burns
And you all shall burn

Incendiary bombing
A hundred thousand dead
Total war incoming
An outbreak of dread

Your cities destroyed in the blaze
And more is to come, you can't escape my gaze
Through narrow streets I drag you
Towards the centre of the storm

As Hamburg burns, Dresden burns
London burns and New York shall burn
The wind of death consumes you all
