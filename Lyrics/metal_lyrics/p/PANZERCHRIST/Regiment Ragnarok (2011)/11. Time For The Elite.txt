Our armies stand ready to conquer the Earth
A prophecy fulfilled, given at my birth
Turmoil and chaos is the fate of our race
Your empires collapse with no trace

We shall build and prosper
Then tear it down again
We shall eat and we shall shit
And the world shall split

Turmoil and chaos is the fate of our race
Your empires collapse with no trace

No longer will we wait
No more debate
It's time for the elite
Never will we retreat
