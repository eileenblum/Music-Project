VorwÃ¤rts panzer
We are the legion of the damned
The most feared in all the lands
We were born to this, we had no choice
And now we roam from Jutland's shores

Legion of the damned
Panzer Regiment Jylland

There's no glory to be had
Only bitter combat
The grinding of metal sends us forth
And the commander has set the course
Your blasted lands shall be reforged
Your broken souls shall be reformed

Feel the echoes from the past
Feel the power destroy you

All this time waiting for
The time to see our duty fulfilled
Now we fight with deadly might
Spread our blight, the time to strike is now

Our chaplains preach, we stand alone
On the battlefield that we call home
We break the spine of the world
We leave it helpless and deserted
We were born to this, we had no choice
And now we roam from Jutland's shores

Legion of the damned
Panzer Regiment Jylland
