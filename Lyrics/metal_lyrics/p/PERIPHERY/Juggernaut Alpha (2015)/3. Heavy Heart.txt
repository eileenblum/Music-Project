Experience these things
My chest digs further in and it gets hard to breathe
Donât fight it 
Make this easy

Sometimes I wish I had wings
Fly far away from this life
Itâs a long road
Itâs a long road

As the water beads upon the window
Turn the sad song up on the radio
The fault with me is a memory
When the flesh moves on

Such curiosity
These thoughts go on all day
And it takes hold of me
But fighting isn't easy

Sometimes I wish I had wings
Fly far away from this life
Itâs a long road
Itâs a long road

As the water beads upon the window
Turn the sad song up on the radio
Will the voices haunt when the flesh moves on
And the clouds block out the rays

When the feeling hangs upon a halo
I can only try my best just to let it go
The fault with me is a memory
And the things I have to say

Resting now, their bodies hit the ground
Nightmares creep over me I hear the sounds
(Yes they all hit the ground)
Children scream, their mothers bleed hung upside down

Scarlet ropes and sadistic minds surround me
I spent all of my life confined in secrecy
What you say? 
In spite a shell of what I am on the inside

Clouds of blackness abounding
Thereâs nothing about
Iâm falling, falling, Iâm falling below
(Thereâs nothing about)

As the water beads upon the window
Turn the sad song up on the radio
Will the voices haunt when the flesh moves on
And the clouds block out the rays

When the feeling hangs upon a halo
I can only try my best just to let it go
The fault with me is a memory
And the things I have to say
