Our voices echo on a quiet night
Silver faces, an unholy cathedral
Moon and Sun
A birthing right in this duality
Embrace the feeling of our human skin
intertwining now in ecstasy
Lie in the circle of a few who stain
(our bodies with their own blood)

The blessings given as the child grows
A family burdened with a life full of evil
Sacrifice
Now you can live to see another day
Embrace the feeling of our human skin
intertwining now in ecstasy
Lie in the circle of a few who stain
our bodies with their own blood

(Embrace the feeling of a soul within)
(Lie in the circle of a few who stain)
our bodies with their blood

Our voices echo on a quiet night
Silver faces, an unholy cathedral
Moon and Sun
A birthing right in this duality

These voices echo so violently
A complication with a life full of evil
Sacrifice
Now you can live to see another day
