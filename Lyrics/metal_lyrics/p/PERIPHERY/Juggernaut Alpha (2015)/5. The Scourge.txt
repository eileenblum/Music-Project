As I sit with eyes heavy omens clear,
Face down in seclusion the evil steer,
What drives the stake within my heart,
This man he fell apart.

Now that the entrance is open wide,
This black all around makes its way inside,
What have you done? Will hate abide?
Where is my death invitation?
Elation?

Dead winds whirling, beneath these prayers I hide
I'd give my life for a taste of, taste of
What lies beyond in that place now
Live Earth rising beneath, these hands untied,
I'd lead my I life on the line

(Never one of them, never one of them,
Never one of them, never one of them,
I am not free)

(Never one of them, never one of them,
Never one of them, never one of them,
I am not free)
I am not free

Survive! I will survive!
Glass ceilings above drop rage upon them
Stone cold fist and a memory running on the blunt end of a blade
The blood that it spills shall start my serenade
To you

I will survive,
I will survive,
Survive!

Silence is bringing on the heart attack
Pushing and pulling going on within my brain
It says to lay low
Dead end, the darkness latches on
Now I am a product of a mind
That wasn't ever mine
And now it says "kill them slow"
Weighed down
I'm drowning in this stale moment
Renown is yelling at me from above
This is a one way road
Kill them slow
