Silence is bringing on the heart attack
Pushing and pulling, going on within my brain says
To lay low
(To lay low)

Dead end, the darkness latches on now I am
A product of a mind that wasn't ever mine and now it says
Kill them slow
(Kill them slow)

Weighed down, Iâm drowning in this stale moment
Renown is yelling at me from above
This is a one way road
Kill them slow

Long ago I was forced to drink
Now I long for a taste
Of what stains the murder in red
Straight back to the moment of a distant memory

Strip away all the empathetic
Feeling towards a world thatâs grown
Absent of all my love

Sadistic, sadistic horror
(Sadistic horror)
(Horror)

Dead end, the darkness latches on now I am
A product of a mind that wasn't ever mine and now it says
Kill them slow
(Kill them slow)

Weighed down, Iâm drowning in this stale moment
Renown is yelling at me from above
This is a one way road
Kill them slow

Stop fucking pulling, will you release the grip and let go?!
I've got a life to live and a life to end
I'll hang 'em up, leave a bloody mess all around
Bow my head and calmly walk away

Kill them slow
