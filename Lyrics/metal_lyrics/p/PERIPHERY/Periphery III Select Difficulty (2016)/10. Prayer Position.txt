Another day pulls me down to my knees and
Holds the gun to my fucking head
Can't feel a thing
Prayer position holding my life above the muck
Oh god, I'm speaking in swirling bowls
Now the walls are laughing in silence
I'm spiraling down to the floor
Can't feel a thing
When will it end?
When is it over?
When can I leave?
The bar is held down on my throat
Kicking and screaming, I live this life down in a hole

Take away misery tomorrow
Shine a light to end this dimming glow
Take away misery tomorrow
Shine a light to end this dimming glow

The day is gone
Now turns the night
Our bodies glow ever so bright
The crash is done
We reach new heights
Our bodies glow ever so bright
Venture through these eyes and lose all time

Scratch the itch and murder the body for pleasure
Sparking it up
Breathing the fire we crave
Guzzle it down
Feeling the sparkle together
Ante it up and blow me away from the high
Let's go
What are we doing and where have the morals all gone?
Now is the time
This is the feeling we treasure
You won't remember but goddammit it's fine
The bar is held down on my throat
Kicking and screaming, I live this life down in a hole

Take away misery tomorrow
Shine a light to end this dimming glow
Take away misery tomorrow
Shine a light to end this dimming glow

Stomp my head, throw me down in a hole
Stomp on my heart
Let's go
