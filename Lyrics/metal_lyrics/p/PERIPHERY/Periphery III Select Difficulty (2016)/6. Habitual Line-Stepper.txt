We walked the line
Living in a state of mind controlled by a tyrant
Mistakes burn
Never did he learn to back off and spit that shit
I'm that motherfucker picking in your old brain and stealing sleep
Take the dive to keep it all alive?
Now it's on you

Your tower is falling down into a black hole
Take it away
Take it away now
That agony is crumbling over your soul
Take it away
Take it away now

I'd like to take the prize of your high and jam it deep down your throat
They're calling for the stage to take your breath away
You were the barricading man
They're calling for the stage to give everything away
You were the barricading man

Your tower is falling down into a black hole
Take it away
Take it away now
That agony is crumbling over your soul
Take it away
Take it away now

Lost in the violent throes of this separation
Done waiting on pleasant times
They never arrived
Lost in the violent throes of this separation
Know what you're waiting for?
Watch as they burn your home
I felt insane but it's finally come to meâ¦
My dear brain, hate
Feel hate
Let go of all your fear

Your tower is falling down into a black hole
You were the barricading man
Your tower is falling down into a black hole
You were the barricading man

They're calling for the stage to take your breath away
You were the barricading man
They're calling for the stage to give everything away
You were the barricading man

Show us the way
Your tower is falling down into a black hole
The agony is pouring over your damned soul
Was there a way to be a better man and stay?
Was there a way?
We'll never know
Show us the way
Was there a way to be a better man and stay?
Was there a way?
We'll never know
