Wake up
As I stumble into a blinding light
Deeper breaths enough to kill the highest highs
Take one good look and I'm at the lowest low again
Down at the bottom, but I'm fine
Tears march to lullabies and beat me like a drum
It's not your average fucking misery
This heart as chords, but not a single one sounds new or fun
Hit strings in dissonance
Pick on, and on, and on

Show them how to fly away when this world is torn
If you feel like dying, lose that forever
You're shining and it shows

Living through the highest highs
You're shining and it shows
Down at the bottom, but I'm fine
I try to feed it, but it still wants more
Give me that feeling that I'm looking for

Show them how to fly away when this world is torn
If you feel like dying, lose that forever
You're shining and it shows

Wake up
As I stumble into a blinding light
Deeper breaths enough to kill the highest highs
Take one good look and I'm at the lowest low again
Down at the bottom, but I'm fine
At the bottom, but it's all so wrong

Tears march to lullabies and beat me like a drum
It's not your average fucking misery
This heart as chords, but not a single one sounds new or fun
So long to sanity
For now that's how it goes
