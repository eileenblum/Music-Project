Beauty is but a visual in fantasy
Mistakes are only real when you slip out of it
Beauty is but a visual in fantasy
Mistakes are only real when you become the mess
Fall back on the cloud, man there's nothing new left to do
And there's not a single thought in the cross-hairs of your mind
Stop shouting from a mountain
Maybe sing a tune from within you
We've gotta move to the meadows from the mire

This is a view from outer tunnel-vision
I'm holding position
This is a view from outer tunnel-vision

Now let go of your senses and let go of your time
We already know the message is gold
Can't we lighten the stride?
No reflection shows the dark on our side
We already know the message is gold
Can't we lighten the stride?

Beauty is but a visual in fantasy
Mistakes are only real when you slip out of it
Beauty is but a visual in fantasy
Mistakes are only real when you become the mess

Now let go of your senses and let go of your time
We already know the message is gold
Can't we lighten the stride?
No reflection shows the dark on our side
We already know the fucking message is gold
Can't we lighten the stride?

You can follow with me
Or keep walking against me
It doesn't fucking matter, because I tried
You can follow with me
Or keep walking against me
It doesn't make a goddamn difference

Now let go of your senses and let go of your time
We already know the message is gold
Can't we lighten the stride?
No reflection shows the dark on our side
We already know the message is gold
Can't we lighten the stride?

This is a view from outer tunnel-vision
I'm holding position
This is a view from outer tunnel-vision
