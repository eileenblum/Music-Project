Snow coming down now
Like December, burning up in the summer rays
But I'm not stumbling, like a pretender
Medicine flowing through my veins
Heavy eyes, but the tongue won't stutter
Mouths are moving and this heart is still fluttering
I'm on my own

You found me in the cold
Now I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes
Are we growing old and am I melting in the rays of this love?
Never ever gonna let you go
Don't let go

Slow it down now
I cannot remember why I let them chew on my brain
They've come and left this town in smoldering embers
But my gift, I'll die in your rain
Heavy eyes, but the tongue won't stutter
Mouths are moving and this heart is still fluttering
I'm on my own

You found me in the cold
Now I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes
Are we growing old and am I melting in the rays of this love
Never ever gonna let you go
Don't let go

Do you feel the love?
Yes I feel the love
Taste it, hold it, feel it, never let it go
Do you feel the love?
Yes I feel the love
Do you feel the love?
Yes I feel the love
Taste it, hold it, feel it, never let it go
Do you feel the love?
Yes I feel the love
Don't let go
