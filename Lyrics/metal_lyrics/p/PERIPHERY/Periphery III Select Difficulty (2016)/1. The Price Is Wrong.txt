Knock me out
And put a stone on my head
Or throw me on the tracks where the steel can kill me quick
The sound of emergency is stapling a fright upon their ears
I'm feeling surrounded
I'm feeling the slap of a thousand shit-brains
Behold my dark intensions rising from below

Beauty, disgusting, blood
Fatal wounds of the last emotion
Beauty, disgusting, blood
All will pay the price
ERRGHH YEAHHH

Now is the time that we separate our realities
Stopping a heart that beats inside the meddling
Correcting moments lost by living in the here and now
You're on the fucking block

Tell me any way I can relate now
Before the generation dies
Time keeps moving faster and faster
And I can take the full step
Killing the generation

Beauty, disgusting, blood
Fatal wounds of the last emotion
Beauty, disgusting, blood
All will pay the price

Get off the fucking building
I'll send em' sinking into the fires of fate
Every word is like a shotgun shell so
burn inside my hell
I'll drown before the fucking ship hits the ocean floor and thank god I'm not alive
To see the slack-jawed generation spread it's fucking seed

Tell me any way I can relate now
Before the generation dies
Time keeps moving
Faster and faster
And I can take the full step
Killing the generation

Beauty, disgusting, blood
Fatal wounds of the last emotion
Beauty, disgusting, blood
All will pay the price

Pouring sludge into the mouth they feed
They feed and I can't stand the stench of it
I didn't see the first and I sure won't see the last
But something has got to give
Something has got to give
Pouring sludge into the mouth they feed
They feed and I can't stand the stench of it
I didn't see the first and I sure as fuck won't see the last
It would put a smile on my face just to take that breath away

Beauty, disgusting, blood
Beauty, disgusting, blood
Beauty, disgusting, blood
All will pay the price
