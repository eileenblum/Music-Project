[iTunes Bonus Track]

Somewhere beyond this sight
Nothing so clear
Reaching in endless night
Colors disappear

Separate the air we breathe
Sell the lies we all will speak
Don't ever ask the questions challenging the prophecies

Silent storm
Following the stars
Shifting form
Dwell in reverie
Resurrection in time
We Suppress every reason

Through these eyes perception bleeds mortality from my soul
Nothing can change
The reality of it all will never be left for us to find

Somewhere withing the glow, enter
We fall
Holding the shadow close
We hear the call
Solace finding even flow in life

Don't ever ask the questions challenging the prophecies
Pleasant this solitude in violent forms and waves
The final blow is struck

Silent storm
Following the stars
shifting form
Dwell in reverie

Moving forward on the path
Deliver us from the daggers in our hearts
The final blow is struck

Pleasant this solitude in violent forms and waves
The final blow is struck
