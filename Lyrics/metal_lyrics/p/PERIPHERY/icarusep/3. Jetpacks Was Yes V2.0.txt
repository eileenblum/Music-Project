These walls of time release
My eyes move like the drift
The cries, they resonate within
The fabric tears before me
Break ties between the kin

Reaching for a way out of this dream
I waste my breath ascending
Fears lead me astray
The past brings them to be
Whats left to carry me...

But a memory
The dream endures these lies
Forever at the edge, left surviving alone

Whats left as I wonder
I've found a world where I am free
Inside that which is truth

What of this illusion I've come to know?
It's not the same
Holding back the distance memories
Presently I've found I am not alone
In a world of infinity sewn

I reach for a way out of this
I waste life like it's nothing but a fantasy
Fears lead me astray
The past brings them to be
Whats left to carry me

Perceive beyond the seam
A soul evolves as one
