Heart stop, and carry on through the light.
Can you tell me what I'm missing?
This sleep sought after twists the dagger in the question of what lies within.
So heart stop beating on through the night.
Give an escape for the blinded.
Although I follow, it seems to pass the time.
I wait with certainly inside this theory.

I hear them speak with tongues of fire, while setting the heavens ablaze.
Live a life high up on a wire of fear.

It's not for me to say what you need to believe, and I won't speak until it's over.
It's not for anyone to say what it is to perceive.
Steadfast, wallow in their punishment.
Take pleasure in the sight.

False cries.
Corrupting the soul of a saint and with knowledge of gods we relate.
Watch from afar, dodging religious scars.

Disregard my existence?
Don't ignore me!

Speak of forgiveness is sin?
I bathe in your hatred so putrid and crimson.
Never an ounce, never an inkling of repentance do I give.
Throw it away.
Piss on the demons and their hypocrisy.

It's not for me to say what you need to believe, and I won't speak until it's over.
It's not for anyone to say what it is to perceive.
Steadfast, wallow in their punishment.
Take pleasure in the sight.
