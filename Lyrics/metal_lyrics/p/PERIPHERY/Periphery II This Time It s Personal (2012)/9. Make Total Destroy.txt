Welcome to the truth; a life that's not your own.
Controlled by labor, printed paper and the corruptors of the world.
Synthetic lies collect our minds to the beast.
We've had the rug pulled from under our feet.
Media terrorists thrive on deceit, 
spoonfeeding bullshit served by elite societies harnessing fear as a weapon.

The time has come for all to see,
the man behind the curtain cast into disease. (into disease)

Take back the light.
It's a dangerous place we're headed for if we accept defeat.
Now we know it's a show they've been running from below.
Burn it down until the ground beneath the faulty entity is glistening
under the wings of a golden era.
Listening to the hate they've created inside us, we grow.
As we reduce their religion to bones.
Yes, we reduce them all to bones.

The time has come for all to see,
the man behind the curtain writhe in self defeat. (defeat)
When will the world seek truth within?
The eye in silence grants the knowledge to begin. (to begin)

Reverse what's lost awake the song within you.
Rejoice aloud. Let these words imbue.
Reverse what's lost awake the song within you.
Rejoice aloud. Let these words imbue.

Shape the future.
Sifting power back in the hands of the common man.
Give them hell for existence. 
Pouring blood on the path they've set in stone,
as we reclaim our position to the throne.
Yes, we reduce them all to bones!
