Connect these signs. The evidence will
Lend itself to be more than just a lie. I'm
Not asking much, just a simple request
That you think for yourself, once in this 
Goddamn life. Fuck!

Forward. The violent state of mind
Obsolete and taking the back seat. Reach
For the stars, control the fucking skies.
Can you silence your opinion of what I'm 
About to say? Go on and let the mind
Perceive.

Neglect the sense of ignorance to alter
Life. Embrace the beauty from inside.

WE ARE ONE.
We are the strength of the universe at
Heart. Construct the light. Implore of the
Energy, bestow the understanding.

Follow the scent of the sinners as the
Body of our mind disintegrates. Forever is
The course upon your plate. Don't ever
Ask if we consume the blood and hate.
Repeat this life if you will, but don't count
On forgiveness from the filthy swine.

Here we stand at the threshold of
Paradise, stealing a new world. I never
Would have thought our place in history
Would come to this, but we are infinite.

WE ARE ONE.
Neglect the sense of ignorance to alter
Life. Embrace the beauty from inside.

WE ARE ONE.
We are the strength of the universe at
Heart. Construct the light. Implore of the
Energy, bestow the understanding.

WE ARE ONE.
We are the strength of the universe at
Heart. Construct the light. Implore of the
Energy, bestow the understanding.
