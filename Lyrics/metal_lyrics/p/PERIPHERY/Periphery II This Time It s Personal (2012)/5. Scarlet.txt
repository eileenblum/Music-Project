Keep running back to kill because it might make it easier
A fear that keeps you chained down to the ritual adhere
You're a slave born into a dark world of disease
A slave that's longing for a rich way

Learning to love a disaster
Direct your soul in the essence of light
To draw the blood of the master 
Flee
The stains on your wings now carry the fray

Tell that she
Embraced the glory vengeance brings
Hold, curl in tight
Illuminate the light

Punish me, punish me
An eye for an eye, an eye for the wicked
Just the sight of me
Your cold intention, burn intuitions 
But with a smile on his face
Exist like you can last within this wretched place
So please forgive what I've become

Learning to love a disaster
Direct your soul in the essence of light
To draw the blood of the master 
Flee
The stains on your wings now carry the

Coldest zeal
Extracted from the omen's life
One steady hand in victory
Darkness weeps
As love informs under a pure and present night
Point from the eye, endure the way

Learning to love a disaster
Direct your soul in the essence of light
To draw the blood of the master
Flee
The stains on your wings now carry the fray
