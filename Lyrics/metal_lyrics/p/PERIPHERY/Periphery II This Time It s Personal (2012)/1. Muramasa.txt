Somewhere in time, we welcomed in the fall. But
in the distance we can see, shining clear, our demise to be. 
We're not listening to ourselves.

You ask these questions in subconsciousness,
but still we choose to deny the flood
surrounding nations. Wake up! The water is 
rising now. We are the universe inside of you
waiting patiently.

All the world by a thread? Distance the lies that
are sold. They will not justify the pain. They will
not live to see the day.
