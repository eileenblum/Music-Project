"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Heretic Anthem."

I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet
Got a super dred bet with an angel drug head
Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer

A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
It's evilsonic, it's pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be

If you're 555, then I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say

I bleed for this and I bleed for you
Still you look in my face like I'm somebody new
Toy - Nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine, because you're made of
Everything I'm not

If you're 555, then I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Heretic!
Yeah!

30 seconds, 16, 8, 4, let me tell you why
I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest
They're listening, clamoring
All the money in the world can't buy me

Go ahead, lie to me
Tell me again how you're tortured
I wanna know how you followed your orders so well
You're full of shit
You had a dream, but this ain't it

If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666

If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
Heretic!

Yeah!
