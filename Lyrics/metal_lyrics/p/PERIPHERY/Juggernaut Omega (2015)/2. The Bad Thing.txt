Sometimes there's a crack in the world that I can peer through,
to see it for what it really is.
Thereâs an ugly face staring back demons are everywhere,
They draw the hatred from inside of me.
There were times at the top of the world that I wish I could throw,
Everyone and everything.
Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites,
I'm bathing in the thought of it.

the severed dreams of all the weak - quenching thirst inside of me,
And the scream it holds the key - unlocking this for all to see

Fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe
Far from the leaves, transcend these earthly boundaries
Fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe
Far from the leaves, transcend these fucking boundaries

Isn't this desire that you're looking for?
Or is insanity just knocking on your door?
give me just a piece and surely you will find -
Everything is better on the other side.
can you look within to find what is in store?
This life is but a scream that has become your whore
It's tearing a hole inside, you're buried alive

Sometimes there's a hole in the Earth that I can step through,
To get away from the twisting of tongues.
It looks a lot like a grave when I'm staring up,
Feel the soil creeping over me.
There were times at the top of the world that I wish I could throw,
Everyone and everything.
Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites,
I'm bathing in the thought of it.
