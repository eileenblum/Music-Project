Cold embrace, let these old wings set ablaze
Old wings set ablaze
Summon the violence to end our pain, call out
to future brethren "We'll erase the stains"

Tonight we'll eradicate the decay
We'll throw the lives that are bent to their knees
Ignite the flames and burn with rage
Shots fired and I've got a fucking reason
To suffocate when a breath leads to treason
Cut the ties
Collect what's mine
Burn everything and feed the fucking ground

Bound by fate, all lives fade
Last chance to meddle with the agony
Now choose your side

Summon the violence to end our pain, call out
to future brethren "We'll erase the stains"

Tonight we'll eradicate the decay
We'll throw the lives that are bent to their knees
Ignite the flames and burn with rage
Shots fired and I've got a fucking reason
To suffocate when a breath leads to treason
Cut the ties
Collect what's mine
Burn everything and feed them to the ground

Tonight we'll eradicate the decay
We'll throw the lives that are bent to their knees
Ignite the flames and burn with rage
Shots fired and I've got a fucking reason
To suffocate when a breath leads to treason
Cut the ties
Collect what's mine
Burn everything and feed the ground

Tonight we'll eradicate the decay
We'll throw the lives that are bent to their knees
Ignite the flames and burn with rage
Shots fired and I've got a fucking reason
To suffocate when a breath leads to treason
Cut the ties
Collect what's mine
Burn everything and feed the fucking ground

Feed the fucking ground
Feed the ground
