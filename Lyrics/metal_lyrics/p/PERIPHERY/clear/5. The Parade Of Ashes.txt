Constant is the parade of ashes
Keep the distraction, bat those lashes

Build up the monument to
Build up the monument to break it down

Concealing the intent of fascists

Resurrect,
Humanity has fallen by the way side

Fuck your theories
We are the way we are
The violence is out of control
And we paint the walls red,
Murder the innocent
We're digging us a deeper hole
Catastrophic creations, oh

Destroy, erase the masses
Festering vessels line the caskets

Build up the monument to
Build up the monument to break it down

Dissect the world to see what happens

By the hands of man
To have her death upon the sand, EEYEAH

Fuck your theories
We are the way we are
The violence is out of control
And we paint the walls red,
Murder the innocent
We're digging us a deeper hole
Catastrophic creations, oh

Fuck your theories
We are the way we are
The violence is out of control
And we paint the walls red,
Murder the innocent
We're digging us a deeper hole
Catastrophic creations, oh

Will the canvas we paint with our hands
Spill the blood of our youth in the sand?
YEAH

Faces cling at the light I made
Closer wreckage will seek to connect
Will the canvas we paint with our hands
Spill the blood of our youth IN THE...?

[3x]
Fuck your theories
We are the way we are
The violence is out of control
And we paint the walls red,
Murder the innocent
We're digging us a deeper hole
Catastrophic creations, oh

The parade of ashes,
The parade of ashes,
Bat those fucking lashes,
The parade of ashes
