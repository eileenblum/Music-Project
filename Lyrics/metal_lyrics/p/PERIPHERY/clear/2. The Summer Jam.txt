Cut up the planet for an illusion
Home isn't far from where the resource is
Fusing distant lands

A sign of life is steadily ending
Call out so desperate for a way
The cries are readily sending
They beg of night to release the day
They're calling out for a better way
(Cut up the planet for an illusion)

Coldest nights sometimes give way to brightest skies of blue
Moving onward carrying the life that's in plain view
And we will carry with a thriving few

Corrupt the planet for evolution
Though what we see is not the fault of man
Only leaps and strides

Cut up the planet for an illusion
Home isn't far from where the resource is
Hoping for a better way

Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly
We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie
Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly
We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie

Coldest nights sometimes give way to brightest skies of blue
Moving onward carrying the life that's in plain view (plain view)
And we will carry with a thriving few

Corrupt the planet for evolution
Though what we see is not the fault of man
Isn't far from where the resource is

Stripped of ground by the hands of those who have built
A life surrounding causing quarantine
Reach for skies
Reach for a belief that this life equals something

Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly
We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie
Conjure a way to the heavens and suddenly
We suddenly ask ourselves if this light is worth the lie
