Walking through water as it dampens our feet
Watch as we call in self-defeat

The trees are calling to the man in the mask
They know his true identity, identity

Come and stare
Come and stare at her love through these eyes
From a mountain so high
Is it possible we've forsaken our Mother?

Return to nowhere
And nature will know my name
This is what it takes to feel at home
In her soul that's beyond light is where I lay (I lay)
Until the dusk of man

Yes he squanders the life he leads
Still the end will call
Birth of anti-bionic seed
Will he grow with fault?
Grow with fault

Come and stare
Come and stare at her love through these eyes
From a mountain so high
Is it possible we've forsaken our Mother?

Return to nowhere
And nature will know my name
This is what it takes to feel at home
In her soul that's beyond light is where I lay (I lay)
Until the dusk. OF. MAN!

[4x]
When it snows
Do you feel the love?
Wind, it blows
Through our bodies
Return to what we know
