Not to alarm you, we're being watched.
Don't sound the sirens just yet
Not to alarm you, we're being followed
Bury the hatchet. This isn't my heart attack

Don't threaten to slit my throat,
I need this jugular to talk to people like you

You're getting away with murder

It's like Russian Roulette.
I'm losing all my bets.
But as the saying goes

Keep your friends close, your enemies closer

Keep your friends close, your enemies

And while you were asleep I was collecting bruises
