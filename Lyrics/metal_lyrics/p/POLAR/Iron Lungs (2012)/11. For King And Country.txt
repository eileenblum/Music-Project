Attack is the best form of defence.
I declare a call to arms
Home is where the hatred is

Put me on the front of the firing line.
Art has no enemy but ignorance.

What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
United we stand. Divided we fall.
This is my rifle. This is my gun.
United we stand. Divided we fall.

Here's to hope, Here's to glory.
This is for the king, This is for the country.

What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
United we stand. Divided we fall.

For king and country, We make our pledge

There is no common ground

For all those left behind.
I will fight your cause

For king and country, we make our pledge.
Dig the trenches. Hold Your ground.
