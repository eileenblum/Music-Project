Every action is another nail in the
Coffin of the name I was honored
Enough to represent
Never want look back and say I never lived
Iâm living with the fear that Iâm becoming
What I hate
Iâm warming to everything Iâm against

What you see in yourself
Is what you see in the world
What you see in yourself
Is what you see in the world

I should know I should know know better
I should know I should know know better
I should know I should know know better
I should know

Every action is another nail in the
Coffin of the name I was honored
Enough to represent
Never want look back and say I never lived
Iâm living with the fear that Iâm becoming
What I hate
Iâm warming to everything Iâm against

Self prescribed and unaware
This will leave us like the walking dead
Self prescribed and unaware
This will leave us like the walking dead

Donât judge a book
By its cover
All my books
Have broken spines

When the ink has dried
Youâll write me off
What you see in your yourself
You see in the world
Better to have loved than lost
Than to have loved at all
When the ink has dried
Youâll write me off

Every action is another nail in the
Coffin of the name I was honored
Enough to represent
Never want look back and say I never lived
Iâm living with the fear that Iâm becoming
What I hate
Iâm warming to everything Iâm against

Donât judge a book
By its cover
All my books
Have broken spines

When the ink has dried
Youâll write me off again
