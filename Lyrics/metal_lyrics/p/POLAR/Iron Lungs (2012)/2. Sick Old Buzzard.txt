We won't recover from this

If you raise hell you better be ready to control it.
If the ship goes down we go town together

We won't recover from this

Have trust in these rock and roll killing machines.
You failed me so I'll sick about lack of safety.
No one should bear this crown

This is why tigers eat their young
We won't recover. We won't

What hope do we have? Just a generation left hanging
What hope do we have? Just a generation hanging
We're not to blame
London's burning, you won't put it out
If this ship goes down we're going down together
Hanging
