How is this so bent out of shape?
These broken bones need to mend

They say blood is thicker than water.
Lately I've washed my hands of you
We have become sick. In need of first aid.

These bodies we have been given are now left in ruins

We won't get out clean.
We've been dragged through the dirt for so long
So here's to a future with no friends.
The candle is burnt - both ends.

Not on my watch

These broken bones

They say blood is thicker than water.
Lately I've washed my hands of you
We have become sick

How's it been so bent out of shape?
