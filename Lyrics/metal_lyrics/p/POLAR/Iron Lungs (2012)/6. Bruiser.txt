Fists speak volumes in this town.
Excused have been used up.
It's just a matter of time,
Until we cross antlers again

Building foundations on cold empty threats
Let your fists do the talking won't leave you any better off

A guilty conscience need no accuser.
You've already done enough
Under Achiever. Over Reactor.
You're nothing but a bruiser

Better to die with honour than live with shame.
I'm calling this my revenge.

You've been left like the dog
That you are to lick your wounds
If you see like that. If you feel like that.
Than I ask you to make a stand

Under achiever. Over reactor. You're just a bruiser

Fists speak volumes in this town

You pollute the lives of the honest.
