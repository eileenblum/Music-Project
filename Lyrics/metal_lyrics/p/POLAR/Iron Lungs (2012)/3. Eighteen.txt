This is a loss
Of innocence

Tracing back through the stolen youth

We have taken our past
For granted

Just how easy we really had it

A small spark

Will make a great fire
In time

Will burn us all

At eighteen we moved forward without caution
Some of us got caught in the undertow
Things will never be this good again
Those words have never been so true

Spend my years trying to sell the world

All I did was sell myself out

We have taken our past
For granted

Never knew how easy
Its been

Just like the rest
Iâve never known whatâs good for me

Just like the rest
Iâve never known whatâs good for me

Just like the rest
Iâve never known whatâs good for me

Just like the rest
Iâve never known whatâs good for me

A small spark

Will make a great fire
In time

Will burn us all

At eighteen we moved forward

Without caution

Some of us got caught in the undertow

Those words have never
Been so true

Those words have never
Been so true

At eighteen we moved forward

Without caution

Some of us got caught in the undertow

Those words have never
Been so true

Those words have never
Been so true
