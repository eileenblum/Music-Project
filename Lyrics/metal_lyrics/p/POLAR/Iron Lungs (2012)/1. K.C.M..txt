Here are my confessions, you can read through them one by one.
I've had my fangs drained of their venom,
I've had the feeling taken from in me.
Is this all i'm worth?
I'd rather be in her majesty's pleasure than have to read through your rule book.

It's not your entertainment to watch me flatline, it's not my time.
And if you want me you'll have to come and get me,
I've perfected the art of pulling knives out of my back.
