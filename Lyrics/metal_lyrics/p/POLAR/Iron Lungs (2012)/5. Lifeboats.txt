We live these risks in a state of recklessness.
We live these risks, ignore the warnings
The waves finally broke us

We're out of our depth, we're out of control in a state of recklessness,
we're out of our depth, we're out of control

We're guilty, guilty by association, cutting away the anchors.

We live these risks in a state of recklessness. We live these risks. Ignore the warnings

If we're the wreckage then send in the lifeboats.
No promise of a safe return thats the risk we live with.
That's the risk we take. That's the risk we take

We're out of our depth, we're out of control in a state of recklessness.
We're out of our depth, we're out of control

We're guilty, guilty by association, cutting away the anchors
Throw your dead overboard

It's a trap! The waves finally broke us
