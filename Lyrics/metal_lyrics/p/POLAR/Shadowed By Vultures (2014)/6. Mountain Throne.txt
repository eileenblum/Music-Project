All I ask of you
Donât lose your way
Never lose faith
Streets aren't the same

Weak willed
Been stuck in my throat
Iâve found a voice
One that can be heard

For all the times
And as weak as I am
Never fall for your enders
Can you not see
The trail of destruction
Empty voids you leave
In the name of money

Greed holds the crown

Heartless all around
We are condemned to be criminals
Taking back the crown
We are condemned to be criminals

WE ARE
WE ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CRIMINALS

All I ask of you
Donât lose your way
Never lose faith
Streets arenât the same
The trail of destruction
Empty voids you leave
In the name of money

Greed holds the crown

Heartless all around
We are condemned to be criminals
Taking back the crown
We are condemned to be criminals

WE ARE
WE ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CRIMINALS

All I ask of you
Donât lose your way
Never lose faith
Streets arenât the same

Taking back whatâs rightfully ours

Hail the king of the mountain throne

Lost the values of the heart
We were born to fade away
To the soundtrack of our dying days

WE ARE
WE ARE CONDEMNED

Heartless all around
We are condemned to be criminals
Taking back the crown
We are condemned to be criminals
