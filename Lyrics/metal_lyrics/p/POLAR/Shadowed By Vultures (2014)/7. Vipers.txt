Fighting to be free
This will be the death of me
I canât be the one

Pride can sink a man
But save the next one
Iâve cut a deal with the devil
Iâve sold my soul for a life
Save my soul to heal me
Cut my throat to kill me

Fighting to be free
This will be the death of me
I canât be the one

Our days are truly outnumbered
No hope is left in this world
Die for the pain you have caused me
Take the blade

Bask in the flames of the traitor
Your memoryâs lost with your lies
Die for the pain you have caused me
Take the blade

Hate blood shot my eyes
Love is destructive
Iâll die with pride by my side
Iâve sold my soul for a life
Save my soul to heal me
Cut my throat to kill me.
