As I go under
I go unanswered
You speak of vengeance
I talk revenge
Born into a war
Dishonoured, dishonoured
Bloodlines

Iâve lived with a death wish
Bloodlines share our hatred

Misery weighs down your eyes
Disgusted, disgusted
We share the same blood
Seasons change
But youâre still here
Disgusted, disgusted

Bloodlines

See you in hell

Your genes and ours make poison

Iâve lived with a death wish
Bloodlines share our hatred
