Take away the air we breathe
Until you choke us out
We are strong enough to last
Donât fill our hearts with doubt
I wonât accept it, lie down and take it
Your promises are paper thin
Iâve been burnt too many times
Letting darkness in

This could be our last journey
Our friends have fallen as kings
Burning common ground
Letting all your darkness in
I am smoke to your mirror
A break in the chain
All your skies may be clearer
But I wonât be back again

A smoke screen, see through me
Staring back is just like I canât breath
(And I know that weâre young
and we keep holding on)

Too these iron lungs
I will keep holding on
