Cold nights, lost time
Give up life for the sacrifice

Bright lights, fist fights
Our passion burns inside

This is the way I choose to live my life
Constantly falling
Constantly falling down

This is for the nights that weâll never forget
The four letter words that you swore with regret
Black days, empty hearts
Bring back the old days
This is for the nights that weâll never forget
The four letter words that you swore with regret
Black days, empty hearts

Reminisce, old times
You only get one life
Live fast, die young
Give up life for the sacrifice

This is the way I choose to live my life
Constantly falling
Constantly falling down

This is for the nights that weâll never forget
The four letter words that you swore with regret
Black days, empty hearts
Bring back the old days
This is for the nights that weâll never forget
The four letter words that you swore with regret
Black days, empty hearts
