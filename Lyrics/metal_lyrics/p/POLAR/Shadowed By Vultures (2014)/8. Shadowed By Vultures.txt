Bastard son
King of defeatists
Youâre too far gone
How do you sleep at night?
I feel his grip around the back of my neck
In need of rescue or a full blown escape

This holy land is fulled and fucked up with hate
Circled by sharks as we sit here and wait

The greatest trick that weâll ever pull
Is showing the world we werenât born from fools

Thrown to the wolves for the lies that we make
Shadowed by vultures as we starve to create

The greatest trick that weâll ever pull
Is showing the world we werenât born from fools

This holy land is fulled and fucked up with hate
Shadowed by vultures

Bastard son
King of defeatists
Youâre too far gone
How do you sleep at night?

The greatest trick that weâll ever pull
Is showing the world we werenât born from fools
