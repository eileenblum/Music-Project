Keeping true, what we believe
Crossroads that lead to nowhere
We wonât give up, weâre not going down
Last man always holds the crown
Now fall on heavy eyes
Sympathy lies with sleeping lions
I will rise, you will fall
This is our dead reckoning

I am the water that fills your lungs
Drowns you out, I am the hard times
That never let up

Drowned and left in a lifeless form
Hope is tarnished with defeat
I will riseâ¦ you will fall
This is our dead reckoning

I am the water that fills your lungs
Drowns you out, I am the hard times
That never let up
I am the water that fills your lungs
Drowns you out, I am the last times
That never let up

Takeaway the air we breathe
Believe in dreams, living in nightmares
Are we strong enough to last
Await the full collapse

Keeping true, what we believe
Crossroads that lead to nowhere
We wonât give up, weâre not going down
Last man always holds the crown

I am the water that fills your lungs
Drowns you out, I am the hard times
That never let up
I am the water that fills your lungs
Drowns you out, I am the last times
That never let up
