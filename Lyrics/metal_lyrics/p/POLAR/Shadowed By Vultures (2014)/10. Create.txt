I never swear on lives
So many lost along the way
It's never easy letting go
There's still hope for me
I won't go quietly

I cutting the dead weight
I'm looking for a clean break
A new day to call my own
I'm putting it behind me
Regaining my honesty
A new way we stand alone

I never swear on lives
So many lost along the way
It's never easy letting go
There's still hope for me
I wont go quietly

Inspire, create, destroy

We stand alone
It's never easy letting go
There's still hope for me
I won't go quietly
We stand alone

We stand alone

With it against us
I'm breaking it down
With or without you

We stand alone

I never swear on lives
So many lost along the way
It's never easy letting go
There's still hope for me
I won't go quietly

Sing at the top of your lungs
There's still hope for me
I won't go quietly
