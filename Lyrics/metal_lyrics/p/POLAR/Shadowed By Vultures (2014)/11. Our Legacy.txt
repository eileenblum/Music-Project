Unite our voices
Because we are not alone

Who can take your right to live?

What we hold free
Last breath to the bottom
Set your sights high
Unite our voices

Stand our ground
Raise up from the bottom
Unite and stand
weâre not alone

Unite our voices
Because we are not alone
Keep your heads above water
Because we are not alone

We hold the key to our future
These words our legacy
Stand up and make yourself counted
Come on

Are you scared?
Never scared
Stand together
Raise your fist

Unite our voices
Because we are not alone
Keep your head above water
Because we are not alone
