This isn't the fix that I need.
She's got her teeth stuck in me.
So she strikes and she bites.

My chariot is my chest piece.
Broken chariot coming forth to burn my home.

This isn't the fix that I need.
She's got her teeth stuck in me.
So she strikes and she bites.

Your bark is worse than your bite.
Have I struck a nerve?

So she strikes...
You should see me at three in the morning
When I'm waiting for my death now.

Have I struck a nerve?
