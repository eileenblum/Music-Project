Tie your knuckles tight.
It's all about the midnight sting.
I'm not going to lie, I enjoy your punches.
We are raging bulls fueled by the red inside.
Don't lose your head, twelve rounds and we're still not down.
You're dressed to kill, with that look in your eyes.

I've got you in my sights and I'm not letting go.
Maybe I should learn to bite my tongue.
I'll be the adrenaline rush through your veins.
I'll be the cure you don't need but I'm here to stay.
Break in, break out, this party's dead on its back.
Break in, break out, it's time to prove them right.

The last words she said to me:
"If that liquor touches your lips, you won't be coming home with me."

I've got you in my sights and I'm not letting go.
Maybe I should learn to bite my tongue.
I'll be the adrenaline rush through your veins.
I'll be the cure you don't need but I'm here to stay.
Break in, break out, this party's dead on its back.
Break in, break out, it's time to prove them right.

Throw down cursing the night.
I'll never do this again.
