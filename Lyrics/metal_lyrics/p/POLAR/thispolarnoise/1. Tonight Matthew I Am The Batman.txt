How could I have lost my thirst?
For the well is running dry.
Should I drop my standards?
Sit back and watch the slaughter?

Keep your hands where I can see them.
You are the saint,
We are the sinners.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
You are the saint,
We are the sinners.

Take my water.

How could this make me feel alive?
Now it drains me dry,
Now it drains me dry.

Keep your hands where I can see them.
You are the saint,
We are the sinners.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
You are the saint,
We are the sinners.

Keep your hands where I can see them,
For the well is running dry.

Once my thriller is now my killer.
Take my water.
Keep my pulse racing.

Abandon the plan, run for your life.
I've lost my thirst for the well is running dry.

I've lost my thirst.
You are the saint,
We are the sinners.
Tonight Matthew I am the Batman.
