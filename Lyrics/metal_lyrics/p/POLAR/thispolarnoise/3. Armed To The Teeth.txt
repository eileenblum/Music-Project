Let me impress you by spitting some English charm.

There goes your boy.
I bet you're so proud the way he's read the riot act.
Let me impress you by spitting some English charm.
Just enough to have you biting your knuckles.

Repeat offender. Protest your innocence.

It is my right to remain silent.
Anything I say will be used against me.
This is payback for all my crimes.

I will have you biting your knuckles.
I will be there gritting my teeth.

There goes your boy.
I bet you're so proud the way he's read the riot act.
Let me impress you by spitting some English charm.

Repeat offender. Protest your innocence.

It's my right to remain silent.
Anything I say will be used against me.
This is payback for all my crimes.

It's my right to remain silent.
Anything I say will be used against me.
Repeat offender, when will you learn?
Don't raise your fist like a champion.
