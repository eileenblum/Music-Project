I'm going to paint my masterpiece.
Suffer for my art like I want it to be.
I'm not waving but drowning in the sea.
I'm a ruined canvas.
Dying for my art like I'm meant to be.
Your modern ideas down wash around here.

Call off the hounds!
We've already sunk.
I won't be a damn gentleman anymore.
Call off the hounds,
Take him down!

I will not be a gentleman.
Call off the hounds,
Take him down!

Truth will not save you.
I will not fail.
Call off the hounds!
