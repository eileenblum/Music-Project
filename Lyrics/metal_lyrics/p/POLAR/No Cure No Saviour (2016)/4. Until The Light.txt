We give in, pushing out
This life is hard to swallow
No mercy on this path
This path is that to follow? 
Finally find out that time cannot
And won't be trusted 
It cannot be trusted 

When I'm dying on the inside 
And it doesn't get enough time
Waiting here for you
There's nothing on the other side

Dead whispers stole my life
No mercy, show me a sign (sing it!)
Dead whispers stole my life 
No mercy to my decline 

Blisted, scoded 
As the life moves over 
A shadow grieves and goes the sun
And it's loaded

When I'm dying on the inside 
And it does not get enough time
Waiting here for you
There's nothing on the other side

Dead whispers stole my life
No mercy, show me a sign (sing it!)
Dead whispers stole my life 
No mercy to my decline 

Our time is in decline 
Until the light takes us 
Our time is in decline 
Until the light takes us

So deep for all of our lives
Until the light takes us 

When I'm dying on the inside 
And it does not get enough time
Waiting here for you
There's nothing on the other side

Dead whispers stole my life
No mercy, show me a sign (sing it!)
Dead whispers stole my life 
No mercy to my decline 

Our time is in decline (dead whispers) 
Until the light takes us (dead whispers)
Our time is in decline (dead whispers) 
Until the light takes us (dead whispers)
