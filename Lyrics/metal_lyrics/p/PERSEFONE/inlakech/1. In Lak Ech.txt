[feat. Tim Charles from Ne Obliviscaris]I don't know those eyes
But I can see myself
In every piece of you
Like a mirror that reflects
A thousand forms of me

Fragments of myself
You are as I am you.

This truth of oneness
Woven the web of live
Countless strands
All-linked threads

Pulsating vessel full of light
Branches of the same tree
Outreaching from the roots of love
Your life goes through me
I feel as I am you

Breathe all that is
Exhale all you think
You are one with all

I embrace my reflection

A bond of love
Every tear the world has cried
Fills my eyes and my heart
Leave your soul in my hands
And will be at home.
We are one below this vault

Living life unaware of the hidden truth
Just an observer.
A brief piece of time
In a universal, infinite, living mind.

I can recognize myself
By looking through your eyes

Breathe all that is
Exhale all you think
You are one with me

Leave your soul in my hands

There's no way to separately
I can feel my other self in you
Part of all this cell.
You are me, I am you.
