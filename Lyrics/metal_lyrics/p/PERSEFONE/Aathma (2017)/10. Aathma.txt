[I. Universal Oneness]

Inner landscapes
Feels like a light within my mind
This place knows no fear
The anger feels so far away from me

Tears of joy as I can feel
That every part of me is connected with the source
I feel at home
I feel, I found myself for once complete
Free to breathe!

Inner light crushing all I thought I ever knew
I'm moved by a quiet and everlasting shake of feels
I throw my hands to the sky
And with them the will to be part of this new reality
My being at last is free

Part of everything!

I'm no longer meant to feel lost
I breathe
I extend my wings
And I fly over this new realm!

I feel my inner self pulsing through my veins
My core vibrates and shakes my soul
Witness of the timeless dance of life and death
I feel overwhelmed
I'm floating in this sideâ¦

Feeling aware of my own breath
Awakening of consciousness
Evolutionâ¦
I take the chance to rise my being
The truth beyond my mind
One is many as many are one
With all linked
Rooted to the same source of light

[II. Spiritual Bliss]

"You are not the body or the senses, the mind or the intelligence, the name or the form. You are the Aathma itself."

All I can see
Comforts my being
No more fear
As I let the light in

[III. One With The Light]

This new me can't be defined
This new me can't be described

Movement of the mind
Fire in my chest
My hands become my eyes
My body heals
As I connect myself with all that ever was
This painful transformation
I survived to my own lies

Effortless, I leave behind the mourn
And walk away from the singularity I once believed

Now I can see
I feel I crossed the line
My heart vibrates with all

My soul is not contained within the limits of my body
Instead, my body is contained within the no limits of my soul

[IV. â¦Many Of One]

I'm not this body
Nor this realm of senses
I am not this face
These eyes, these hands
I'm a living wave, calmed

I'm within this light
I've let go of the burden
I let go

I am just this soulâ¦
