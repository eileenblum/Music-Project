I transcend
I flow
I am the ocean
I vibrate
Behold, the sound of a living

I live behind the screen of thought
Projections have no substance here
A slender thread informs my life
I taste the coals that burn my eyes
I am the pain, the joy and the fight

There is no separation in this illusion

Breathe every piece of the existence
And feel the entire universe inside of you
Evolution in compassion
Expanding boundaries where there are no more
Giving birth to a new way of being!

I transcend
I flow
I am the ocean
I vibrate
Behold, the sound of a living
I transcend
I flow
I am the ocean
I vibrate
Behold, the sound of a living wave

I let go of anger
I let go of judgment
I let go of guilt
I let go of fear
I feel I'm nothing but a living wave
