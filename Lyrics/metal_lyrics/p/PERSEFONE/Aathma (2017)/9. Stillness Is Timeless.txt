Arise and cease
Still and silence
My inner self being guided
Somewhere new
Somewhere deep
Somewhere timeless
Starting to see the world as a constant flux

When we lose the clouds
We gain the sky
Clear your mind and allow you to discover
Something in yourself that never dies

Now I see myself among the stars
I'm a speck of dust floating in the immensity of space

Nothing endures but change
Nothing disturbs me now
I refuse the grief, the sorrow and the pain

See the stars
The moon and the sun
How they move in silence
Timeless
Free yourself
Let the world flow
And accept the change
The impermanence

I'm not worried about losing my identity
Since I am nothing!
I am part of everything
I am the time, I am the change
The river that flows endlessly
I will keep the flame alive

For the eternity
I will rise above the universe
Part of everything
I am the time and the change
I'm still and silent
