Trying hard to keep the pace
Living under rules I was told
But never felt
My mind just walks a path the world dictates me
I'm paralyzed!
My will feels numb

Senses overload
A magnified sense of reality that keeps me dazed
Forced to deal with a game
I never asked to join
I'm feeling tamed
By this realm of singularity

Disconnected with myself
Building walls, global involution!
Invited to a mindless existence with no face

I'm breaking up the pattern now
Freed to find my way

I refuse to lose my being
Alienated by a false sense of existence

Let me out!
Let me find!
Let me out!
Let me find!

I will let my inner self breathe for once
