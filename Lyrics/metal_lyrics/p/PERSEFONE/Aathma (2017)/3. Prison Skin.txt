Standing
Confused
Tears in my eyes
Void in my heart
I donât know who I am anymore
This trance defies the realms of my mind
My head collapsed by the magnitude of this feeling

Let you be, close your eyes
and dare to see what always wasâ¦

I will, I want!

Donât want to be what I am not anymore!
Trust your being, let you feel connected with this life.
Thousand voices, fear and anger, 
Fighting ego wants to keep this false I alive.

Confined by the walls I built
Being consumed by this prison skin.
Open your Eye
Feel what youâre insideâ¦

Youâre not your face, 
Youâre not the name youâve been given
Break these walls and see the Light,
Transcend the senses, 
Be!!

There is more, 
That I canât see 
That I canât touch
But I can feel, deep
I will break free
For this false reality 
I will!
Leave the anger 
Open your heart
Bloom outside this prison skin.
