Explosion
A deep explosion in my soul
Outbreak of an esoteric power
Like an opened mystic door
Unleashing secrets
Strength, light, truth, love, life
Conscience...

Inward awakening
Something has taken my me
Wisdom, powerfulness
I feel invincible
I'm a warrior of life
I become the mighty god we all have inside
