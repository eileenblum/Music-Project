A light has appeared
A pure life is born
On this earth
In this world
Bringing its inner power

Molded from our birth
Manufactured
Like a robot
Hypnotized
Stage by stage
Erasing our essence

Unconsciously
Each influence along our lives
Creates on us
A false being

Denying the purity
The innate brightness
Turning off
Our deepest evolution

A distorted world
Living in lies and illusions
Limits the true vision
And the expansion
Of our power

But buried in the deepest of my being
A flame's still burning
A hidden truth
A covered perception
Conscious I see
The great reality
Its throb increases
Coming closer to it
Feeling like I'm losing my home
I feel the real in the unreal

My foundations crumbles
All my world destroyed
I plunge into this huge perception

The secret is revealed
A universe full of love
Remembering what we are
Attracting all we want
Appreciating
Being grateful
We are beings of light

A state of consciousness
With our roots in the present
Deeply fulfilled in completeness
Embracing our life
The existence
Feeling we come from
The source

Internalize this deep truth...
What you see outside
Reflects what you have inside
You create your own reality

Feel your wounds, your emotional locks
Heal your inner world
Clean the window of your life

Allow your wisdom
To lead you soul

I open my heart
My whole being
I let the light
Pass through my
Fears and shadows
My inner child...
My deepest emotions

I leave myself
In hands of healing
In silence
I trust
I know it's for my sake

A reconnection with the source
The origin of all life
As the center of the universe
Eternal
Transmitting love, infinite joy
Well-being flows to us

Allows ourselves to receive...
All this stream of energy
We are becoming conscious
Connecting
And learning how to
Live in all its dimension
