The most horrifying moment of my life
At the bottom of my heart
My inner child is crying, scared, shouting,
Shocked
Deep and hidden fears are unlocked

My childhood
My loved ones
My entire life...
All is being lost
I am living my death

This is the way we feel
Death here on earth
But the vision is changing
We are evolving

Realize...
We have linked
Emotions, thoughts and feelings
To our physical shape, of flesh and bones
Temporal, limited, perishable

Perceptible invisible forces
That belong to the immortal spirit
Your energetic shape
Transcending time and space
Extension of the source

So much dark around this step
So much fear... Ignorance... The humankind
Filthens it.

We have been instructed
Hypnotized during our life
Instilling in us
That life ends with death

A new horizon
A clear and healed vision
We are sons of the omnipresence

The experience of feeling
There's no end to life...
Never-ending
Is being real

Release yourself
"Physical spirits
Remember birth is the opposite
Of death
Your life is an ageless path"

It's time to
Face my death
Liberate myself from Samsara
I transcend this spiritual step
Losing my being, my ego
To live only present

I enjoy the learning on Earth
And consciously, happy
Living in my soul
I return back home

I detach from my body
It's not what I really am
It's not what really lives
I know I'm an eternal soul
Quitting and leaving the matter

I join the spiritual world
The invisible kingdom
Where I belong
Oh... Great reality
The Heart of the universe
The source of all life

I let myself go...
