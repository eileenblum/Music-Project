Huge blue planet
Immense wonder of life
Floating for years and years
Full of beauty
And forms of life

The wisdom of nature
Helps us to feed, to grow
Allows us to live in it
And appreciate
The majestic of Gaia

I feel the Earth
As a totally-rooted giant tree
Linked to this energy body
I venerate all its presence and beauty
Its pure life

We have to understand
Our planet evolves, rises
A crucial time
A gift of life
A spiritual migration

Rising to a higher dimension
Towards a natural state

All the inner changes
You experience are the result
The consequence
Of the vibrational ascension of Gaia
Let them happen
While you help our planet to rise!

We've forgotten it
Forgotten the link
Earth, soul and Universe
We've never been separated from it
We've just disconnected ourselves
The reconnection begins now!

Everything is spiritual, everything has a spirit
Everything that is brought here by the Creator
The one Creator
And so, I hope you believe that if you are not spiritually connected to the Earth and understand the spiritual reality of how to live on Earth it's likely you will not make it.

A new Earth
A new Earth is emerging
The natural balance is being reborn

The veil dissipates
A progressive transition is happening
Low vibrations will be healed
Suffering's eradication

I embrace my planet
Together we do the great migration
Gaia's evolution's also mine

I feel the Earth
As a totally-rooted giant tree
Linked to this energy body
I venerate all its presence and beauty
Its pure life

"Oh, mother Earth,
I thank you for all that you give
I'm rooted to you
I feel you
I am you."
