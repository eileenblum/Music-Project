"Here it is again
Hateful monster
With all my rage and force
I pushed you
Into the dark depths
Where always you must be
Don't move from there..."

Deep-rooted
Always present
This attitude does not lead to a growth path
Well fed in our civilization
Therefore instilled in each one of us

All of our surroundings
Have conditioned us
Have taught us
To hide...
Hide what they don't want to see
Have cut ourselves piece to piece
Forced to hide parts of our being
But who decides what to do
About your soul
It's you!

I realize
What I've been doing all this time
Imposed from the outside
Unconscious attitude

But who are you
To cut the wings of my soul
You cannot control me
You will not have such power on me

Courage in both hands
Forces and wisdom on my side
I take the reins of my being
And now, introspection sinking
Emotional immersion, go!

I open my thick floodgates
The fear is growing
The desire to flee fires
Afraid I cry!

A wise voice appears
Supporting me

"Trust, trust..
With love
Embrace what you are,
If you can't accept yourself,
Who will?"

Affected by the magnitude of these words
I understand it
I deeply feel it
Accept
Embrace myself
All the pieces
Shadow and light
Is the only way to the inner release

Now I know...

All the fear disappears
I want to see every part of me
Pushed by the power of healing
There's no more shadows I won't feel

It's the way
I feel free
Healing what consumes me
The light enters through the gaps
Breaking them with force
Opening my soul to life
To the deep inner fullness

My wings are spreading
Breathing for real
Feeling connected to the existence
I can tell
I have reached home

I perceive I'm here to experiment and learn
Being one with everything
Earth...
Soul...
And the universe...

Growing to the fullness

Acceptance is the way to bring light
And balance ourselves
End the hiding
Love all what you've become

You should stop all this game now
To become completely alive, go!

You waste your energy

Pushing your shadows
Like air underwater
You can use this force for your sake
All the outside world is a mirror
A consequence, a reflection of your inner world
Heal it!

See
Accept
And love yourself foremost
You decide your life
This is our planet's path
The way
To the natural state

Living in balance

Healing everything
Changing inside
Embracing the existence
Re-align body and soul
Perceive the great reality

I clean the window of my life
To let the light come inside
Evolve!
