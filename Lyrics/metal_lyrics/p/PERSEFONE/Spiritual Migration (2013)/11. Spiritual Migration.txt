Feeling like I'm losing my home
My entire life is changing
Foundations of my known soul crumbles
All the experience, all my world, destroyed
Something is growing inside
A new life, a new force, a new me...

I'm now connected
With a mystical force
The perception is being deeper
My fake past disappears
Here and now
I let myself flow

I surrender to life
Leaving my being
To this immense source
As a river
Flows the ocean
Rooted into our mother Earth
I'm a channel
Between sky and ground
I feel conscious, alive
I'm one with life

Totally present
I see, clearly
We are asleep
Unconscious people
Atrophied beings
Having lost their essence

We have the big chance
To be full in this world
We create our life
Attracting all we want

Think...
Feel...
Be...
Connect...

Break all your limitations
Negative thoughts and feelings
You've dragged and fed for years
You've lived what you've chosen
Attracting it to you
Know that they seriously hamper
Our inner power growth

Because there is...
Imprisoned by ourselves
Waiting to be released
Comes from the universe
Wish to pass through you
And allows us to grow

I open my soul
My heart 
My whole being (And flow!)
Transforming my vibrations
I realign myself, connect again with the source
Where we come from

I understand
I'm transcending from an imposed life
By our known world
To the great and majestic reality
A deep spiritual migration

The Universe helps me to flow
While I help our planet to rise
Perceiving this new reality
I feel gratitude and peace
We can always enjoy well-being
And feel the joy of being alive
Finding our place in this world
Is our spiritual migration
