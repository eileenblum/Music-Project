[Lyrics by Alden, Rdiger &amp; Iawr]

"Floating in the mist
Across the boundaries of time.
A blinded humanity
Searching the truth in the unknown paths of destiny
A feeling of solitude invades their minds
Meanwhile, the future awakes."

A thousand tears in a thousand years
Time has passed by the endless shores
Ethereal shades, ancestral winds
Mystic shine of the timeless tyranny
Human fate, eternal night
The hope, the pain, they fear.
Non-existence where no life dwells
By time alone I waited, I cried, I felt!
Fall of men
Fatal sights again
There's no reason, there's no faith.
The pain decides
The world demises
Eternal wheel of human being
Lost in chaos
Sorrow rules
Beyond life, beyond hope
Take me out!
Buried into the depths of nowhere
Signs of human decay
Feeling sadness, denial of dreams
Fatal reality
Man's demise through the realms of time
Chaos resolves their sins
The flame of the everlasting fire
Has begun to fade away
Floating in the mist
Across the boundaries of time
A feeling of solitude invades their minds
Ripped the truth off, buried hopes
Falling in a sea of madness
Self destruction guides their fears
And fears guide their blinded minds
Last embrace of the eternal life
Shattered destiny
Idyllic dream turned to ashes
The cycle now complete

[Solo Iawr]

[Solo Alden]

[Solo Rdiger]

Buried into the depths of nowhere
Signs of human decay
Feeling sadness, denial of dreams
Fatal reality
Man's demise through the realms of time
Chaos resolves their sins
The flame of the everlasting fire
Has begun to fade away
