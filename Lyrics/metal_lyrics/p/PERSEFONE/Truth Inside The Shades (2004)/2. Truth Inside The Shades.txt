[Lyrics by Rdiger &amp; Iawr]

Sorrow gives me inner calm
Please hollow damn me!!!
Darkness remains in my pain
Loneliness stacks my eyes
That thrown at night
Brought me a sign and die.
Winter still
Grief is my mind
Ancient feelings in me
(Truth in me)
Scrabbling for illusions
Beg my night
Torturing me
Waiting for my life.
Feel my void
Hollow thoughts
The hope decline that slowly has grown
Hear my cry.
My sense is wounded
'cause I have found the truth inside the shades.
Free is my mind
But who am I?
Free is my mind
The beauty of existence dies in me
(Trust in me)
Another fear, the pain, the void
I see faces (reflecting)
Pieces of my soul like shattered glass.
I ask..., I pray..., I...
Scrabbling for illusions
Beg my night
Torturing me
Waiting for my life.
Feel my void
Hollow thoughts
The hope declines that slowly has grown
Hear my cry.
My sense is wounded
'cause I have found the truth inside the shades.

[Solo Alden]

This untruth, no worth!!
This, my life, doesn't mind!!
Kill this glimmer of hope!!
Leave me!!
Solitude, solitude!!
Leave me in my own misfortune
The sights of my life!!

[Solo Rdiger]

[Solo Iawr]

Scrabbling for illusions
Beg my night
Torturing me
Waiting for my damn.
Kill me!!! Kill me!!! Kill me!!!
'cause I've seen my truth inside of me
