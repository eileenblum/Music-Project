I feel their hate
I can see the fear in their cowardly eyes
They treat me as a beast, a demon

The man who cannot feel
Searching for glory
So that to be reminded
Fighting to death

The great warâs about to explode
This is the chance for me to rise
From this darkened hole
Itâs hard to think
Thereâs only chaos around
Just blood, and shouts

Luck chose the enemy
To claim the triumph against us
Against me

Just blood and shouts

Death is near
Pursuing me.
I canât fall that soon
And I hide under those
Who looked at her eyes

And I learnt (that) the power of mind
Is the cutting edge of the sword
From fight to fight, master after master
Harvesting the seeds of knowledge

My bladeâs required to veil for otherâs causes
But my warâs against the beast
And the promises I didnât keep
To those I left
Throughout the way

They call me beast, they call me demon
Until my skill get over them as a master

Practice and perfection I searched for
Learning is all what I have done
I faced death with courage everyday
And I always saw the dawn rising again...

And it was the time and the moment has arrived
The warrior sight lights the trace of my blade...
I honour the way you follow in life
Now fight!!

Standing firm I keep your sight
I await your first strike
You use your force I use my mind
Fate will decide... who will die?
With honour you will lose your life
