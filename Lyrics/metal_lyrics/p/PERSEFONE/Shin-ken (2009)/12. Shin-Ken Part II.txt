In my way, I found some moments of void
And I thought upon her
The promise that follows my steps
The light I have seen in my darkest hours

The one who never trust my lies
Lies said to protect her from myself
From all my shadows, from all my desires
To avoid them hurt me through her

I used my hands to work the stone
The fire guides my fingers to write
And the wind brings me a perfume
I have never forgot, sheâs just by my side

Chi, sui, ka, hu, kuu,
Towani
