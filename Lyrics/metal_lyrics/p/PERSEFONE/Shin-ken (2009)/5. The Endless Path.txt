Searching perfection through practice
Facing the life with patience
Staying calm in the middle of the storm

Complications become easily
Simple things become complex
Thereâs a reason for everything
And everything needs a reason to be

Searching for truth on every move
Any day could be the last
Never falling to oblivion
Every step leads to the knowledge

In the long way of perfection
Where the aim is an ethereal illusion
Unreachable in a thousand lives

Starting everyday
Like the sun beneath the horizon
Choosing every move, slowly
To never forget the small details

A calm sight to the next goal
The defeat cannot be a way
Is only the end
In honour remains
To born again and follow the endless path

The way kept clear in mind
And hands kept stronger to strike
Deserving to be someone
Everyone can be the one
When everything is getting worse
Stay harder than stone
Fluid like the waves of the sea

Life is the harder fight
Winner or looser
It doesnât matter
Just the honour and glory
Just training to protect all those beloved ones

Never surrender when falling down
Keep walking even in the fog
Never crawling and keep trying
Let the soul follow the truth
Let your inner strength flow
Follow the truth...

Searching perfection through practice
Facing the life with passion
Thereâs a reason for everything
And everything needs a reason to be
Searching for truth on every move
Any day could be the last
