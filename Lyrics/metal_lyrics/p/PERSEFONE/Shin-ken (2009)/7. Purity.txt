The wind is murmuring a light
That lights the night
And only its voice is advicing me

Iâm longing to find the void
The emptiness
That means everything

Iâve resigned my body
And now the land is my home...
The sky cries in the rain
The tears I keep
The universe, me, the void
Are all the same...

Inert desert breathing out life
The same mistake
The same success
Justice that never fails
Justice that never hesitate...

I am the void
I am everything
Bushido is dying in every chance
Deathâs as pure as life
To born pure and die still
Being stronger than mankindâs weakness

All around my skin
Timeâs skin lies over me
As a huge animal bended over
Your light that shines right in my eyes
Is the beginning and end of everything
Water spilling through the dreaming fingers

My hairâs the wind
And my feet the earth
Never hesitating
Purity calms down my thirst

I am the void
I am everything
Bushido is dying in every chance
Deathâs as pure as life
To born pure and die still
Being stronger...
