Fight with courage
Donât look at your back seeking for death
Enemy is facing you...
Your sight is cold
Fire in your soul!

Your soul screaming
Your hands keep fighting
Daring is guiding your will
Blood is in your eyes
Freedom in your mind

Thereâs no fear, life is brief
Standing firm in loyalty
You feel the past
The linage blood inside your veins
You fight for them
With strength
And a hundred warriors carried in your
Rage stained blade

Because itâs me
The judge that guides the choices in my way
I decide
How to going on if itâs the end
To avoid living in disgrace

Feel the cold rain in your face
âI hear the strength of my heartbeatâ
Brave ones duelling to death...
âI feel no fear if my way ends hereâ
Follow the shouts of your heart
âIâm doing right pushed by my faithâ
Nor right nor wrong, this is your will
âI have to face my destiny!â

Because itâs me
The judge that guides the choices in my way
I decide how to going on, if itâs the end
To avoid living in disgrace
Facing fears, living every day
As it was the last
Past and now
Loyalty as a good path to behold
To die humbly honouring my life
