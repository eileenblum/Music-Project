Morning rise
The silent roar of the battlefield
And I face right beyond my fears
A sharpened blade goes through the wind
To my destiny

No doubts, nor fright
There is no place for groan
The rage stained blade arises
When the forged steel came across my life
I follow the endless path

In front of tremulous souls
Serenity lies in me
I know they await shuddered

Frozen, shattered
Their courage in terror gets trapped
There is no place for groan
The rage stained blade arises

No doubts, nor fright
There is no place for groan
There is no place for cries

I know it is and endless path
I walk the way of purity
The way of samurai

Running through a thousand enemies

Dodging their strongest strikes
My blood starts to spatter in my face
My blade runs fast
And reach my final objective
And as I fall,
My soul will remain...
