Old as time
The strongest power of mankind
It was searched for
By all men with courage to face it
Living in all of us
Awaits the moment to show its eyes
The power to be the one

Let the rain clean my sweat
Let the wind clear my mind
The pride I must leave behind
To find strength in my pathâ

What you need it lives in you
Strong decisions you must live for!
âOld men in ancient times
Searched for it on the courage pathâ
All your fears disappear
When conviction rises all around
âFear is my wall to get the power
Righteousness will draw out from my soul!â

As did the Sword of Gods
The one that stands is the one who believes
You hold your power as your fears
Stand away from your way
You hold your inner strength
Living every moment as the last

âIn silence I remain standing
Searching for the right ideas
To be strong on weakness
To be wise on ignorance

I feel lost, as my sight has become grey
I behold, what I used to see as clear as a blue sky
A shadow in my will that hides my fears
I shall get over them, bravery!â

As did the Sword of Gods
The one who stands is the one who believe
You hold your power as your fears
Stand away from your way
You hold your inner strength
Living every moment as the last
