Life in every breeze of air
In every cup of tea
When fear holds your heart beating
Cowardice stabs your will
Drowning you in doubts

To get to the agonic point of giving up
Self-destruction, the only path for you to find strength
Youâre weak to the bone
Poisoned for the fangs of lie

Feelings drown in chaotic thoughts
Face the fear, rise against the dawn
Raise your soul with pride
Your sword is faith
As you feel the death
The harder life becomes the more you must stand
You are alone in your life
But brave in your fight

Suffering, wounded
Again and again
Seven times ahead to fall
Rise, Rise an eight
And keep the fight
Keep the fight and
Become a warrior

Feeling drown in chaotic thoughts
Face the fear, rise against the dawn
Raise your soul with pride
Your sword is faith
As you feel the death
The harder life becomes the more you must stand
You are alone in your life
Alone...

Feeling drown in chaotic thoughts
Face the fear, rise against the dawn
Raise your soul with pride
Your sword is faith
As you feel the death
The harder life becomes the more you must stand
You are alone in your life
But brave in your fight
