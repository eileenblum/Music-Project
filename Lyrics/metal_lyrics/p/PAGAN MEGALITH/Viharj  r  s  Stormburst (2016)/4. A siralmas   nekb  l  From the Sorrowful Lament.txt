"Hogy azonban a felsÅbb Ã©s alsÃ³bb rangÃº vilÃ¡giak kÃ¶zÃ¼l 
kik fulladtak a mocsarakba Ã©s folyÃ³kba, 
kiket emÃ©sztett meg a tÅ±z Ã©s kiket vesztett el a kard, 
halandÃ³ nem kÃ©pes megmondani. 

A mezÅn Ã©s utakon hevertek a holttestek, fej nÃ©lkÃ¼l; 
igen sokan a falvakban Ã©s templomokban, 
hol menhelyet kerestek, Ã¶sszeÃ©gtek. 

Ez a romlÃ¡s, ez a veszedelem, ez az Ã¶ldÃ¶klÃ©s 
kÃ©t napi jÃ¡rÃ³fÃ¶ldre terjedt; 
a fÃ¶ld mindenÃ¼tt vÃ©rtÅl piroslott. 

Ãgy hevertek a holttestek a fÃ¶ldÃ¶n, 
mint a legelÅn a szÃ©tszÃ³rt nyÃ¡j, 
mint a kÃ¶vek a kÅbÃ¡nyÃ¡kban." 

[Quotation from 'Rogerius mester Siralmas Ãneke'] 

[English translation:]

[From the Sorrowful Lament]

'But from noble and ignoble profane ones 
Who has drowned in swamps and rivers, 
Who is swallowed by flames and who is perished by sword 
No mortal can count. 

Lifeless bodies lied by on fields and roads beheaded; 
Many they were in villages and temples, 
In search for sanctuary they have burned. 

This decay, this bane, this massacre 
Extended upon two day's walk, 
Red was the earth by blood. 

Corpses wasted on the ground, 
As a herd on meadow 
As rocks in a mine.' 

[Quotation from Master Roger's 'Epistle to the Sorrowful Lament upon the Destruction of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Tatars']
