Az Ã¶nzÃ©s helyÃ©re tÃ¶r egy Ã¡brÃ¡nd a vÃ©g utÃ¡n 
NÃ©ptelennÃ© vÃ¡lni vÃ¡gyÃ³ legfennsÅbb cÃ©ltalansÃ¡g 

Az eszme, minden ellen valahÃ¡ra gyÃ¶keret vert 
Eltapossa a jÃ¶vendÅt az Ãºj vilÃ¡gvallÃ¡s 

ElÃ­tÃ©ltetik, kiben dÃºl az Ã©ntudat 
Kiben Ã¶sztÃ¶n lakozik, kibÅl utÃ³d sarjadhat 

EgykÃ©nt mozdul kezÃ¼nk, mint Ã¶nnÃ¶n martalÃ©kunk 
VeszendÅvÃ© lettÃ¼nk - magvaszakadtak 

ÃrÃ¶kkÃ©tig nÃ©mÃ¡vÃ¡ vÃ¡lt, mÃ©rhetetlen vÃ¡rosok 
Holtak szÃ¡molatlan testÃ©vel borÃ­tva 
A kegyelet, a gyÃ¡sz Ã©rtelmÃ©t vesztette 
ElbÅ±vÃ¶lÅ a szakadÃ©k szÃ©lÃ©n utolsÃ³nak maradni 

MidÅn eljÃ¶vend a fÃ©nylÅ teljessÃ©g 
MidÅn eljÃ¶vend a fÃ©nylÅ teljessÃ©g 

[English translation:]

[Sireless Ones]

Egoism weeded out by longing for the End 
Highest aimlessness, wishes of desolation 

Propaganda against all have taken root at last 
Future trampled down by the new religion 

Sentenced shall be who has self-consciousness inside 
Who has instinct raging, who could spring offsprings from 

Our hands move together, being our own preys 
We have become wasted - sireless ones 

Measureless cities became silent perpetually 
Covered by countless bodies of the deceased 
Enshrining and bereavement lost meaning 
It's enchanting to stand as last on the edge of the abyss 

As gleaming fullness enters 
As gleaming fullness enters
