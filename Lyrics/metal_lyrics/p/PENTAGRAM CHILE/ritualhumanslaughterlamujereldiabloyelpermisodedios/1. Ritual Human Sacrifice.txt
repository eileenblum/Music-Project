[performed by Pentagram Chile]Fifty-Two years have passed
The Cycle is complete
Time to Nurture the God
Tezcatlipoca

Blood must be shed
To avert impending doom
To save the Fifth Sun
From certain extinction

A Chosen prisoner
A God for a year
He climbs the temple stairs
Become the offering
At the top of the pyramid
We offer his heart to thee
Invisible and omnipotent
Divine Entity

God of nocturnal Sky
God of Ancestral Memory
Creator of this World
All-seeing smoking mirror
Take this Sacrifice
Tezcatlipoca

God of nocturnal Sky
God of Ancestral Memory
Creator of this World
All-seeing smoking mirror
Tezcatlipoca
