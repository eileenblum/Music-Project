Eternal foe, antagonist
opposite poles mutually destruct
evil and good, heaven and hell
contradictory collapsing construct

When I die you cease to exist
can't escape the paradox of faith
what you create you cannot destroy
for my demise is your suicide

Feed the deception "to divide and conquer"
you cannot divide what exists as one
perpetual battle, primordial use
final confrontation, metaphysical suicide

The nature of man forever denied
within every huma there's darkness and light

Free from religion and dogmas of old
the death of satan is the death of god
