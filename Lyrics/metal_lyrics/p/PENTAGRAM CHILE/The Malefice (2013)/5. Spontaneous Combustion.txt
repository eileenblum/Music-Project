Silent agony
solitude
isolation
life consumed

Your existence
ran its course
light ablaze you
human torch

Feel the fire
grow inside
flames engulf you
soul suicide

Spontaneus combustion
Spontaneus combustion

They found her lying on the floor
body burnt beyond recognition
surrounding objects seemingly untouched
no apparent source of ignition

Spontaneus combustion
Spontaneus combustion

Aura exhausted
no vital glow
shell imploding
self immolation

Rise from ashes
flee the pain
smoke of freedom
charred remains

Your existence
ran its course
light ablaze you
human torch

Feel the fire
grow inside
flames engulf you 
soul suicide
