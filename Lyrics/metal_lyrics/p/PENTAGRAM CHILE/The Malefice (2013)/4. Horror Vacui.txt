Face your final hour
as the end draws near
look death in the eye
time to accept your fate

No smell of sulphur
no pearly gates
no light at the end of the tunnel
no loved ones await

The delusion you've chased
the lie you've embraced
your life sacrificed
to the mirage of afterlife

Face the truth
the past is dead
present nonexistent
the future absurd

A glimpse of light
a second in time
ephemeral
forever gone

Gaping hole
of emptiness
the horrid thought
of what will never be
