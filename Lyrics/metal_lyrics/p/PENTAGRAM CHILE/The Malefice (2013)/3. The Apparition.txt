Cold winds from beyond
announce a presence in the room
firbidden threshold open wide
dark corners of the mind

Rejected memories reappear
ghosts from a tortured past
spectral vortex of the dark
under spiderwebs and rust

From religion, superstition
fear manifests itself through a vision
admonition for contrition
from the darkness rise

Entities in our minds
long lost to the hunger of time
shattering our sanity
arcane pulses come alive

From religion, superstition
fear manifests itself through a vision
admonition for contrition
from the darkness rise the apparition

Seeking trascendence 
denial of reason
ills of the soul somatized
longing to materialize

From religion, superstition
fear manifests itself through a vision
admonition for contrition
from the darkness rise the apparition

Seeking trascendence 
denial of reason
ills of the soul somatized
longing to materialize
