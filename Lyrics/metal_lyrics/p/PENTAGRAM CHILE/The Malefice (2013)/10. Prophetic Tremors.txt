Tectonic plates violently collide
fractured crust, hell open wide
entrails of earth turned inside out
streams of lava gushing like blood

Monuments collapse, remnants of faith
temples of knowledge rendered absurd
hierarchies crushed, rulers dethroned
men become equal facing the end

Pillars of the world crumble and fall
apocalyptic vision the ancient foretold
