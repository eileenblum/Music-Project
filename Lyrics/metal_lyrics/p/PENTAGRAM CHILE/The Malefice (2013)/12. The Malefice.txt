The malefic core
Inside your guts
Conjured for existence
Alive and beyond
Decaying in pain
Enigmatic Disease
Perpetual torture
The malefice

[Chorus:]
You swallowed your damnation
Now you rot
The chalice awaits
Sacrificial blood

From a remote past
Comes the execration
Unforgotten offense
Retaliation
Words that burn the sky
Make sanity freeze
Life flows away
The malefice

[Chorus]

Burning eyes
Fear tearing at your mind
Silence before your cries
Terror without disguise
Laughing

Dawn of your life
Cursed is your path
Into the dark
Of afterlife

Hideous scenes
Madness is reality
Where are you running to?
Nothing can save your from Horror
