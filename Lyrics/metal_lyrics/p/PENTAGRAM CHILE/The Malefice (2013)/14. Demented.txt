Demons from the past
Tearing at your mind
Sanity fading
Your soul's burning

Consuming silence
Reality abstract
Foul stench of oblivion
Spiritual wasteland

Night falls over your mind
Demented
Leaving the world behind
Demented

Immaculate canvas
Splattered bloodred
Boundaries shattered
Nothing remains

Life of torment
Endless descent
Saints are crying
Your soul's flying

Night falls over your mind
Demented
Leaving the world behind
Demented
