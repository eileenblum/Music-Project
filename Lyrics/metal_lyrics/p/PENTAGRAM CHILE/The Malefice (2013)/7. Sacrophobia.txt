Smear excrements
en the sacred images
mock the scriptures
profane the symbols
destroy the altar
crush the cross
reject the holy
insult the house of god

Diagnosed insane
living locked away
sworn to take revenge
released upon the priest

Hostile intruder
rabid maniac
immune to exorcism
mind and soul possessed
revel in blasphemy
raging heretic
vomit on the host
invert the crucifix
