Down in the forest, of endless rain
A creature lurks, daughter of sin
Her face so abhorrent, words can't describe
What a sane mind, fails to comprehend

Don't you look into her eyes
Her mere sight makes you insane
Her vicious stench breaks your bones
Her inhuman scream freezes your soul

Short in stature, long black hair
Sagging breasts, crooked limbs
Fiery eyes, a hawkish nose
An evil smell, precedes her where she goes

Don't you look into her eyes
Her mere sight makes you insane
Her vicious stench breaks your bones
Her inhuman scream freezes your soul

Fiura
Spawn of sin
Fiura
Evil within

Animal attraction, superhuman force
Malignant seduction, forced intercourse
Disseminating, perversion's seed
Spreading the efvil, of her mother's deeds
