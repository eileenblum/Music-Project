Defying perception
crushing fantasy
shattering imagination
the mind's boundaries

Reduced to dust
in sublime chaos
approach the dawn of time
the A and O

Levitating through spheres of infinity
life falls victim to a grand design
infinite number of paths, simultaneous events
abstract reality, parallel universe

Illusion of free will
mankind's tragedy
blind search in the dark
life's futility

In absence of god
a divine void
yet all is written
from day zero
