Summon the dead from their realms
By the arts of the dark
Past, present and future
The truth lies beyond
Ask the forbidden questions
Uncovering your fate
The eyes of time are watching
What is the fortune you await?

Obscure revelations of death
Agony and insanity
The horrible fate that awaits you
Terrorized now you see
Future is not in your hand
Face the horror you called
The sentence has been spoken
You'll have to suffer and fall

Living in fear
Of the menace known
The future unveiled
Shows frozen horror

Prayers and cries
Won't hide the truth
There's no way out
From our final doom

Insanity
Escape from your tormented mind

Agony
Suffering you wish to die

Death
Gives end to your wasteful life
