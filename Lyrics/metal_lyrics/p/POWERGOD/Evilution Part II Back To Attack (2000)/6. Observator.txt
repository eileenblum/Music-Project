Big eye on the wall
Watchin' every day
No you cannot fall
Cannot run away

The ecstasy of building pictures
Deep inside my brain
I can't escape the magic
Of the holy shrine
The beauty of it all
It takes my breath away
I do not really know
What's yours or mine

Observat^r
Hold it, keep it
Observat^r
Observator

Running through the aisles
Don't know where to go
Seeing different styles
Tell me what I know
