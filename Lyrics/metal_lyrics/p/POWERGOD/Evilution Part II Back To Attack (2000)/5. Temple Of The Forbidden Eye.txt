Welcome to the secret place
Feel the wind right in your face
You must decide which way to go
Hurry now don't be too slow

Battle of time, life an't no crime
Welcome to the...

Temple
Temple of the forbidden eye
The temple of the forbidden eye is burning
So run for your life

Arrows flying all around
Walls come down, a terrible sound
You cannot see, in darkness blind
Leave a burning bridge behind
