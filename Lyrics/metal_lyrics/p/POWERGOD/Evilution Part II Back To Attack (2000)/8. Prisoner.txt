Ignore
The daily trouble with a smile
Machines around you never ask you why
They say
Don't rest even for a while
Your head say yes

Don't lose
Your way gotta stick to your guns
My way is different from the normal ones
Take care
Thinking about my future life
I tell you that I know what's right

Don't tell me the rules
And what is right and where to go
Don't tell me what to think
And what I have to know
I cannot stand the pain

Prisoner
Locked in by myself
Prisoner
The world against me is my engine
To create myself
Can't you feel the fire burning inside my head

Ignore
The lies they tell you all the time
Machines around you never ask you why
They say you have to pay for what you want
Your body says no
