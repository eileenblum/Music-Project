You say you want it
Say you need it
You're never gonna find

What you're searching
What you're missing
You have to leave behind

Look inside yourself
And tell me
Are you satisfied

At the end
Of your existence
You know it wasn't right

Time is running out on you
Do you believe
I don't think you do

Never been real
You stopped a turning wheel
It was not in the cards for you
Now try to understand
This is not the end
Lost illusions are now true

Swimming with the stream
Ain't gonna get you anywhere
Break the silence of the night
And suddenly you're there

Think about our mutual past
I tell you what I see
With you as my friend
I don't need no enemy
