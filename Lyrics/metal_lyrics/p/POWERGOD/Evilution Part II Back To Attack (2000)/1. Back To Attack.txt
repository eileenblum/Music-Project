We're coming to town
To take the crown
Masters of Metal we are
Ready to kill
Feeling the thrill
Sinners protected by law

Noone can stop us
No way to top us
We're here to stay
Gonna blow you away

We're back to attack
Run for cover
Metal force is
Back to attack
Watch your neck
`Cause we're on the attack

You tried to ignore
Welcome to war
What are you going to do
No second opinion
On our dominion
Fuck you, we're Powergod
And who are you?
