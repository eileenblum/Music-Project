You're the weekend warrior
Who knows what's going on
Tell me what's the real deal man
And I will prove you wrong

You're gonna make it
No need to fake it
It's pretty obvious there ain't

Anybody home
Anything inside your head
Anybody home
Seems to me your brain is dead

Building up the restrooms
That the winners have to use
With that kind of priorities
It's no surprise you lose

Knock, Knock
Is there anybody
Knock, Knock
Anybody home
