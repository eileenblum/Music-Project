I walk through the streets
That no longer are home
In the night

I try to escape
From the loneliness
Out of sight

Can it be true
I have to go through
This alone

The picture of you
That I'm staring at
Turns to stone

Let me escape from the darkness
I can't stand the pain
Let me see sunlight again
After the rain

In the name of the sun
The flight of the mighty goes on
Who's to blame who's the one
May the dreams in my mind carry on
With the eagle and the rainbow

The fear of insanity frightens me
To the end
The hope for a better tomorrow is my friend
