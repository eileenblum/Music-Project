I try to remember
Try to catch the sky
I try to forget all the bullshit around me
Don't ask me why

Do your know the feeling
When you're crying in the night
Howling like a wolf
When you're trying to make it right

Through time and space
The journey goes on
The endless search for the meaning of life
`Til the battle is won

Into the battle we ride
For true metal we fight
On through the night
Into the battle we ride
We're riding and we're fighting
And we die for the metal tonight

Black leather or nothing
Spikes and chains
I feel the power of metal is pumping
Through my veins
