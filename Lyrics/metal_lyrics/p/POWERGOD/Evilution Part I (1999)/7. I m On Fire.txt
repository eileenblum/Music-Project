Up from the ashes
Like phoenix I rise
I've got the power in my hand

I see the sun
Through a fatal disguise
On the highest mountain I stand

I will try
To live my life
On my own

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Faster than hell
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Stronger than steel

Time flies by
On a steel horse I ride
Freedom is my only aim

The future is mine
May the lord be my guide
I want to win in this game
