I raise my sword against no one
I'm a peaceful man
But just until something this evil comes to me
I'll do everything that I can

You will never know
What I mean
When I say
I'm a fighting machine

I feel my spirit is rising
I was raised by a priest
I won't sell my soul to the
Darkness around me
I will fight the beast

I'm a mean clean fighting machine
I won't stop 'til I'm done
Mean clean fighting machine
I will be number one
And if the others will be fallin'
I am the one to stand
`Cause I'm a mean clean fighting machine (That's right)
And I will fight until the end

Who is the king of the future
Please lord answer me
I want to find out if I will be your savior
I wanna see
