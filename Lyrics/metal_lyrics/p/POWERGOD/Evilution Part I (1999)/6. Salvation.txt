Can you see the magic numbers
Falling from the sky
Trying to get inside my head
But I just don't know why

Oohh
Feel the power from the brain
Oohh
Driving me insane

Watch out
Salvation through pythagoras
Watch out
And don't be late

I can see the vision
Of a man who knows it all
Is it just a dream
Or is there someone I can call
