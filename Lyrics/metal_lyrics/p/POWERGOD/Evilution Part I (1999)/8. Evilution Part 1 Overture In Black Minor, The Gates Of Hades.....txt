This is the story of the endless
Fight between good and evil, the
Story of our
hero, a brave man...good at
Heart...nothing he fears! Join him
On his trip
To the underworld...

This is my story
From the underworld I come

This is a fairy tale
From way beyond the sun

I am the master
I'm the ruler of the earth

Unholy mothers
Giving evil children birth

Come to me
Come to me
I'll be waiting for you
Come to me
I'm your friend
Come to me
And I will be your god `til the end

I'give you anything
You'll never have to leave

If you start to pray
My son you will receive

From dirty pages

Of black books you know my name

If you follow
Life and death will be the same

In solitude you have to live
Try to find the right solution
You must try to find your was out of here
Welcome to evilution

Oh god please help me
I cannot stand this Pain

When you're obsessed by evil
Crying is in vain

I need a friend
Is there someone I can trust

If you want to survive
Then patience is a must

Wake up
Wake up my son
It's not over
Your life has just begun

I cannot move my feet
I want to run away

You have to run
Or you won't live another day

What's going on
Am I dreamin` or is it real

You won't survive
Unless your heart is made of steel
