We came so close to a raging war
We tried so hard to unlock that door
The people cannot understand
We're standing proud until the end

We have got to be strong
Bang your head all night long

No brain no pain
No brain no pain
No brain no pain
No way

The road was long and the road was hard
No strangers to danger we knew our part
Bangin' maniacs all around
Heavy metal is our sound

Alright metal maniacs
Tell the world that you don't care
When they say
We ain't got no brain
No brain no pain
No way
