At night I wake up from my sleep
There's no one else around
The evil river runs so deep
And I can hear a sound

I'm lost and alone
I can feel reality
And my heart turns to stone
Take this pain from me

There's nothing more to fear
The end is coming near

Gods of War

And the thunder starts to roar
When the bell starts to chime
Revolution is the law

With the power from inside
Never do what we are told
We're ready for the fight
Our souls cannot be sold
We're warriors of steel
We're marching on with pride
We're gonna make you feel
The power of the night
