In the dead Of the night
The riders are coming
coming to take me away
The time is right
Something is calling
The blue sky is now turning grey

Here I am
Heaven is falling
And I am the one
Here I am
Waiting to take on the world by storm now

Children of lost horizons
Catch me I'm falling
I'm losing my soul again

The wind blows cold
The rain starts to fall
I take my life in my hand

The story's told
Evil has won
Darkness all over the land
