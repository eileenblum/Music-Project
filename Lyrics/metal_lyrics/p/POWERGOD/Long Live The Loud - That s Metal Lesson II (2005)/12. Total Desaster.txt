[Destruction cover]

I was born in a dark winter night
thunder and lightning greeted me
now it's the time to begin to fight
kingdom of heaven, I can't see

My home is the bloody hell
at the place where Satan rules
the world is now like a big shell
the fire of hell will destroy the fools

I can never trust the virgin preacher
I can never believe in Jesus Christ
It's all right 'cause Satan is my teacher
people hidden them when we arised

I command and you get down on your knees
we sacrifice infants on Satan's order
come taste blood, our living grease
headless bodies found, one is your daughter
