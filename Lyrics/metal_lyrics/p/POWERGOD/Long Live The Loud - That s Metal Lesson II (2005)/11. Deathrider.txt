[Omen cover]

Ride against the wind shameless killer in the night
Rape another village before the break of light
Trample down the ashes grind them with your hate
Take another helpless life before it's too late

Death rider you've taken the earth by storm
Death rider out of sin and hatred you were born

We all know the reason you haven't any soul
None can fight your power the key to hell you stole
Upon a flaming steed you ride sickle tight in hand
In darkness you were born in darkness you make your stand

Death rider you've taken the earth by storm
Death rider out of sin and hatred you were born

Ride against the wind shameless killer in the night
Rape another village before the break of light
Trample down the ashes grind them with your hate
Take another helpless life before it's too late

Death rider you've taken the earth by storm
Death rider out of sin and hatred you were born
