[Hirax cover]

The feeling of fear, seath is near
This will be the last war
Politician out of control
Play deadly games with our lives

Bombs of death it's over drop from the sky
Nuclear war get ready prepare to die

No more love full of hate
This world is doomed to end
Judgment day soon will come
Dividing the good from the bad

Bombs of death it's over drop from the sky
Nuclear war get ready prepare to die

Nuclear war, dust in the sky
The holocaust has begun
Women and children and men will die
They'll be no one left to fight

No one will live to survive
Life will not exist
Women and children and men will die
They'll be no one left to fight

Bombs of death it's over drop from the sky
Nuclear war get ready prepare to die
