The War Drags Ever On
A war is raging that we don't understand
And I doubt that we can
There's no mistaking the mad sons of Islam
As they spill blood on the sand
A strange religion, that destroys through the Koran
Freedom's lost in this land
Hades or heaven. they're under it's command
Whatever rights had a man

We'll hear the bomb blasts round' the world
With two world wars passed they want to start the third
As they argue 'bout the planes they shot down
And count the dead they have found
An unholy war that's raising hell to the ground

The war drags ever on
The war drags ever on
The war drags ever on
ever on

An arm is severed with a gun still in it's hand
And it's just left to be damned
Their main endeavour has not gone as it was planned
Shoot the boys where they stand
War is forever but as if we had the time
To change their thoughts in their minds
This war will never reflect on all their kind
They should be glad just to die

We'll hear the bomb blasts round' the world
With two world wars passed they want to start the third
As they argue 'bout the planes they shot down
And count the dead they have found
An unholy war that's raising hell to the ground

The war drags ever on
The war drags ever on
The war drags ever on
ever on
