[Raven cover]

Amplifiers humming and you don't have no choice
Standing to attention waiting for his masters voice
Forward is the cry that they're screaming from the rear
Don't try to stop 'em now just get the hell right out here

Mind over metal
Mind over metal
Fist clenching
Neck breaking
Head bursting sound
High
Power
Metal

Darkness falls a mighty roar begins to fill the air
Crazy are the faces of the ones who really care
50,000 watts of power picking at each brain
Stretching every tendon they don't know it
But they're suffering from

Mind over metal
etc...

The eyes are filled with madness as the axe begins to burn
The drums are being pushed up to the point of no return
The mighty back line crashes to the ground

Mind over metal
