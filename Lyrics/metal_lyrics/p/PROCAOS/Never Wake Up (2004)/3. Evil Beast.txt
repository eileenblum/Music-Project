Here, speak to me, now all I want is to agree and see the truth.
Down on my knees, down on my spirit I can hear some voices in my head.
Father I know what hurt's in your soul
Even the pain in flesh, in blood,
You never escape, you never run.
In darkness born, in ligthness hunt,
In punishment die, in murder live
You dirty beast, you human race,
You want it all, you all destroy.
War, rage, greed, death.
Here speak to me, now all I want is to understand, how it is inside?
Down on my knees, down on my spirit, I only see the evil beast.
Father I know what hurt's in your soul
Even the pain in flesh, in blood,
You never escape, you never run.
War, rage, greed, death.
Why are you teaching violence?
Why don't you practice what you preach?
Why do you consult the insanity?
To bring the sickness and the chaos...
In darkness born, in ligthness hunt,
In punishment die, in murder live
You dirty beast, you human race,
You want it all, you all destroy.
War, rage, greed, death.
