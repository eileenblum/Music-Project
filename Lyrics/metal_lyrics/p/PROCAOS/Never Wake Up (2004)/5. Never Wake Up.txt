Another day of rule this world, just end for you tonight,
Look at the t.v. see one more of all your fucking lies.
Never spected what you're about to live,
All your words nightmares, will become true.
All, become, true
And you will never...
Wake up !!! of this fucking nightmare,
Wake up !!! you'll never get out.
The sickened world that your people created
Is now your cell for all the eternity.
You had become a third world man, you live in poverty,
No food, no job, no hope, no money to survive.
A sickness grows into your blood. the poison in the air.
You're under siege, the war destroys everything in your sight.
Now all is true...
And you will never...
Wake up!!! of this fucking nightmare,
Wake up !!! you'll never get out,
The rules has changed, now you're the one under
The iron fist of the brutality.
