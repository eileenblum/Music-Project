Go...
Stuck behind to the grim reaper's land,
Fight, fire, burned in hell, there is your flag,
Take care my friend or you will die.
Redemption of war doesn't make you feel alright.
Remember the blood on your face, stupid bastard?...
Redemption of war doesn't make you feel alright.
Remember the blood on your face, stupid bastard?...
You kill only innocents.
Go...
Soldier of the damned, harvester of pain, you will never scape from death,
Open your arms, look at the sky, do you understand what life is?
Fucking insane, killing your land, destroying the peace, the truth and the hope.
Genocide...
Soldier of the damned, the king of death,
You will never escape,
From the inquisitor's rage.
What is life, without fear, without pain, without killing?
Only a dream in your face, what is real peace or death?
Soldier of the damned, harvester of pain, you will never escape from death,
Open your arms, look at the sky, do you understand what life is?
Redemption of war doesn't make you feel alright.
Remember the blood on your face, stupid bastard?...
Redemption of war doesn't make you feel alright.
Remember the blood on your face, stupid bastard?...
You kill only innocents.
