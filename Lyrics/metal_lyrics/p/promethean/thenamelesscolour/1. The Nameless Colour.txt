Body imprisoned in stone
I came from the outer space
Scourge was cast upon the moor
Non-terrestrial entity - you can't understand what I am

I give life and I take it back
Accept my impartial law

I sink into the ground - my power extends
Your harvests and cattle are mine
I will suck all life out of this earth
Witness me turn this vile world to ashes

I am the unspeakable horror
I am the nameless colour
Bodies rot in my presence
I am degeneration
I am what you can't find words for

I am beyond!

At dusk, the grim dance of trees
Their gnarled hands outstretched to the night sky
Lurking in the well, I rest, malediction
Withering on the face of Earth

Stronger than ever, nothing can stop me now

IÃ¤!

I give life and I take it back
Accept my impartial law

Atop the hill, gaze upon this world of grey
Blasted heath forever blighted
Will you dare glance at me
As I materialize in a halo of light?

I am the unspeakable horror
I am the nameless colour
Bodies rot in my presence
I am degeneration
I am what you can't find words for

I am beyond!

I am the colour out of space...
