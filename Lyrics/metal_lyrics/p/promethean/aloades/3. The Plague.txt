My name is Aeacus
Sovereign of the city of Aegina
Son of Zeus's adultery
My state is doomed by Hera's scourge

Many suns have risen
Since the overwhelming mist appeared
Four times the moon rose
Four times the wind didn't blew

Campaings were the first
To be decimated by the miasmas
Exhaling it each time closer to us

Aegina was besieged by disease

Now it has penetrated our doors
And seized the whole city

Everywhere the eyes land
Everywhere is the desolation
None has hope for salvation

Half dead citizens wander in the streets
The arms outstretched to the vault of the sky
Shouting prayers that remain unheard

And here I remain
Despising this life
Eager to share the fate
Of my fellow men


Everywhere one can see piles of cadavers
Marked with the seal

The seal of the disease
The one which putrefies the insides
The one which decimates entire families

See the temple of the great Zeus
How many sacrifices
Were made there?

How many times the father died
Praying hopelessly at
The feet of the altar?

I saw scattered bodies on the sacred threshold

Cadavers lie unburied
Many are burnt at the same time
On the funeral pyre
With nobody to cry their ashes

My people have been cruelly slaughtered
As I pray stricken by so much pain
The thunder struck as an omen
