By the Styx this pact is sealed
Otus and Ephialtes
Sons of Poseidon
Swore to seduce the goddesses

I shall take Hera,
Goddess of fertility
For I want her to bear my progeny

I shall take Artemis
As my legitimate queen,
Because such is the power of my desire

Arrogant and proud
The giants left
Bound by their brotherly love

None was harmful to them
Except the fratricidal arm

By the land and the sea
They sought their promised
Looking for the divine Artemis

By the land and the sea
They finally found her
And ran towards

The divine figure suddenly
Disappeared in the woods
Under the guise of a sublime white deer

The brothers, splitting their ways
Threw their forceful spears
But haste only made them found each other hearts

As life ran through their wounds
Thanatos, son of Nyx
Took their soul
Across the stormy Styx
For breaking their pact
And coveted Zeus daughter
Across the stormy Styx

Tied by snakes to a column
For the eternity
An owl hooting unrelentingly in their ears.

Disability to see their beloved
Eternal punishment
Endlessly mulling their deadly gesture
