Niobides, born of royal blood,
Daughter of the great Tantalus,
Proud of her numerous offspring,
Held these words...

"Prefer the god that you can see,
Rather than revere the unseeable ones!
My beauty and fertility
Surpass that of the Goddess
Leto, mother of the twin gods.
Haste yourself!
Praise me!
Or my anger is upon you all!..."

Indignant, the Mother of the Gods
Apollo and Artemis
Address them...

"My children, I have been harmed...
This mortal forbade my altars
And does not vow you any respect."

"Cease, said the God of Light, those laments that delay the punishment."

Near the walls of the city of Thebes,
The seven sons of Niobides
Proudly overlapped their steeds.
Unaware of their impending death
And Apollo; and his avenging arm!

The awful slaughter began.
No male offspring survived.

Pierced by murderous arrows
Seven bodies lays
Below the sun.

"Leto, feast on my sorrow
Your son killed me seven times!
But still I am the greatest
After so many funerals!"

This excessive bragging
Was fatal to her daughters.
Artemis,
The vengeful goddess,
Made each of her fall
On their brothers's deadly wounds,
Withdrawing unfairly
Their final breath.

"I admit, you have won.
You are the greatest of us.
Now let me rest, please,
For I have lost all my offsprings..."

Muted by her sadness,
Petrified by what she had done,
Slowly, her tender skin turned
Into the coldest stone

Her veins became ivory
Her tears, marble.
Her last breath was trapped in her
Petrified...
