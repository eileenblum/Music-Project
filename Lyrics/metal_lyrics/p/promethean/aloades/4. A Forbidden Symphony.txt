A strange music crosses the ceiling
It charms me, hypnotizes me
I follow the vibrations
Up to a dark staircase
Just a step towards madness

In front of a rotten door
The sweet lullaby flows
Through the tarnished lock
Will you let me in?
Should I get in?

The screams of his cursed cello
Sing the swirling symphony of desolation

Mister Zann, play for me
Show me what I can't see

Which secrets are you hiding from me?

Mister Zann is playing a forbidden symphony
To save his life
Mister Zann is playing a forbidden symphony
To save our lives

What are you staring at?
Who is hiding?
Behind the window?
Will you answer me?
'Cause I feel your insanity,
It's coming, I can hear it
It's done, we are doomed

The window breaks
My vision gets lost in an ocean of galaxies
The void devours my soul
A demonic wind rushes into the room

Mister Zann, play for me
Show me what I can't see

A tornado of agony takes me
My eyes roll upwards
My body breaks
Losing me in a symphony of madness

Mister Zann is playing a forbidden symphony
To save his soul
Mister Zann is playing a forbidden symphony
To save our souls

Mister Zann, play for me
Mister Zann, play for me
