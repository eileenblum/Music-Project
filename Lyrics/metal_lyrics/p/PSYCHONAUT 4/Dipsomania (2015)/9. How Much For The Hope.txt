The price of knowledge may be the loss of mind,
Price for pleasure - loss of pleasure,
Your world has never been so dreadful,
You made it the way it is!
Price for life is a lonely old age.
And I wanna buy hope,
So what is its price?
How much for the hope?
How much?
Day, one more day,
Lonlinessâ¦
In a crowded transport.
People - side effect of reality.
Drunkness - congenital disease.
Disposition to suicide - acquired defect.
A liquid forest from the syringe,
Lapped up from the floor in the toilet
Is a pure accident.
Thereâs nobodyâs faultâ¦
Is there a hope that the forest will help?
How much for the hope?
How much?
