Don't leave the room, make no mistake.
You need no Sun, if you smoke cigarettes.
Outside all is pointless, especially bliss and pain.
Go to the bathroom and come back again immediately
Oh, don't leave the room, don't call the cab.
Because the space is made of the corridor
Which ends with a counter. If come alive bitch
Opening her mouth, cast her out without undressing.
Don't leave the room; think you're caught a cold.
What can be more interesting than a chair and a wall?
What for go out and get back in the night
the same as you were but highly maimed?
Don't leave the room; dance, catching the "bossanova" rythm,
Wearing a coat on naked body, with shoes on bore feet.
The hallway smells like ski wax and cabbage.
You wrote a lot of letters; one more will be overmuch.
Don't leave the room. Oh, let solely room
guess how you look like. Incognito ergo sum
as form was told in anger by substance.
Don't leave the room! Out, there is not France.
Don't be a fool! Be what others were not, whether sure.
Don't leave the room! Give vent to furniture,
Blend in with the wallpapers. In any case,
isolate thyself from chronos, cosmos, eros, race,virus.
Keep chronos, cosmos, eros, race, and virus from 
getting in the door
