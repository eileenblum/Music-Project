Ease that tension
Let's fuck apprehension
With your anal retention
You're getting quite exponential

Prime groover
You're my mover
Cause I blew you
My crime user

Ease that tension
Let's fuck apprehension
With your anal retention
You're getting quite exponential

Iâve got faith, youâve got filth
Iâve got tunes, youâve got rules
Iâve got a cure, you're in reach
Shut up, baby, now do not preach

Do not preach
Do not preach
Do not preach
Do not preach

Prime groover
You're my mover
Cause I blew you
My crime user

Do not preach
Do not preach

Iâve got faith, youâve got filth
Iâve got tunes, youâve got rules
Iâve got a cure, you're in reach
Shut up, baby, now do not preach
