Get your PVCs around your knees
Iâm the pig
Iâm the preacher
Get dirty, Iâll teach you
Throw your pearls before this swine
Loose lips melted mine
Vicious, vivid, Venus fine
Sumptuous joy, so sublime
Iâve toured, whored, been ignored
Gorged, sucked, and fucked some more
I cut a little deeper, never felt cheaper
Hold me slowly, almost felt holy
Way down, baby, get out of my hole
Screaming for a guy to take control
Iâm dressing, caressing, leavinâ, believinâ
Forget it, regret it, please

I need a little foreplay
I need a little more pay
I need a little flashback
I need a little cash back
I got the beauty, sheâs my beast
Looks like a leper but sheâs my priest
The closer we go
Iâm getting tired, my deathâs too slow

My deed is where the dirt is
My home is where the hurt is
Baptized in a sewer of swine
Capsized in the chaos of crime
You're appealing, Iâm appalling
I keep weepinâ, I keep crawlinâ
This wedlock is my deadlock
Ripped so wide, thereâs nothing inside
And I sold out years ago
Living lower than the belly of a rattlesnake
I dress each day with the finest
Got a a shit-filled grin to kiss your face
Lick your body from toe to head
Where it always leads to your silken bed
Kiss my lover's severed head
Thank the lord for my daily bread

I need a little foreplay
I need a little more pay
I need a little flashback
I need a little cash back
I got the beauty, sheâs my beast
Looks like a leper but sheâs my priest
The closer we go
Iâm getting tired, my deathâs too slow

No balls, no brains
Just a bunch of broken veins
Iâll fuck all you hogs
Suck all you harlots
Iâm the last, the pig of starlets
Lets rid it for a reason nothinâ to the wise
Sweatinâ for a high that your ass canât buy
Your ass canât buy

I need a little foreplay
I need a little more pay
I need a little flashback
I need a little cash back
I got the beauty, sheâs my beast
Looks like a leper but sheâs my priest
The closer we go
Iâm getting tired, my deathâs too slow

I dig my toes into the numbness of your life
I leave my foes behind the dumbness of your knife
Told you before, every holeâs a goal
Now you ignore, you're outta control
You messed up, now you better fess up

I need a little foreplay
I need a little more pay
I need a little flashback
I need a little cash back
I got the beauty, sheâs my beast
Looks like a leper but sheâs my priest
The closer we go
Iâm getting tired, my deathâs too slow
