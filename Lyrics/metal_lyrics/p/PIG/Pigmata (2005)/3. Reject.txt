And every day you look me up
And I look down
It's just begun when you say "go"
I will come
Survival counts, my weakness costs
Constant cutting, constant loss
And every time I turn around
I say "get up"
And you go down

I used to know, I used to feel
I could believe in something real
That you reject

And every day it all comes down
To just one sweet hit
The hook, the whore
You know the score
Cause we've heard it all before
This concert hall of reeking smells
Slips inside where suffering dwells
The same old haunting notes that sell
Cause in your dreams
You're judged in hell

I used to know, I used to feel
I could believe in something real
Now I am sold as the fists
Fall each time, every step
Leads to the crime
I'm not the cause, nor effect
Just an excuse
That you reject

Every word I said
That you reject
Scarred into my head
That you reject
Every thing I try
That you reject
Each broken, bloody lie
That you reject
My hatred's sharpened knife
That you reject
Each broken, burning, bloody lie
That you reject
Broken lie
Broken life
