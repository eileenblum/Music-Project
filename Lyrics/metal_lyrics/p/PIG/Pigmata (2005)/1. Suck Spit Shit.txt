This ain't masturbation
This is penetration

Something is wrong in my head
See the stain where I have bled
In all the places that I try
You take the needle into my eye

You suck it all up, you spit it right out
Take it all in and shit it right out

And everyday, just like the last
My sordid, empty, dirty past
Can't you hear the lonely call?
Be the one to stop my fall?

It's time to say just what you feel
And kiss your ass goodbye
And you better squeal
And just for you, I've got a trifle
The sweetest gun
And a little rifle

You suck it all up, you spit it right out
Take it all in and shit it right out

And everyday, just like the last
My sordid, empty, dirty past
Can't you hear the lonely call?
Be the one to stop my fall?

And everyday, just like the last
My sordid, empty, dirty past
Can't you hear the lonely call?
Be the one to stop my fall?

You suck it all up, you spit it right out
Take it all in and shit it right out

And everyday, just like the last
My sordid, empty, dirty past
Can't you hear the lonely call?
Be the one to stop my fall?

And everyday, just like the last
My sordid, empty, dirty past
Can't you hear the lonely call?
Be the one to stop my fall?

Shit it right out
