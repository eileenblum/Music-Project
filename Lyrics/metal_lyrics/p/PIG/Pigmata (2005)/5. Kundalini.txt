Eeny meeny miney moe
Kundalini, get ready to go
Designer vagina, what do you say?
Kundalini, get ready to pray

Kundalini, fit to burst
Kundalini come and do your wÃ¼rst
Kundalini like a little piece
Kundalini, my sweet relief

Open your eyes tonight
You could be wise tonight
You could survive tonight
I'll be your highs tonight
I'll be your lie tonight
Unto the sky tonight
I'll take your blows tonight
I'll show you lows tonight
Deceitful lies will not take you there
The secret life of your labia

Kundalini, get back in line
Kundalini is mine, all mine
Kundalini, relax, reload
Kundalini, do what you're told

Kundalini, gonna be my fun
Kundalini, got a great big gun
Kundalini, you'll be my last
Kundalini, come and kiss my ass

Open your eyes tonight
You could be wise tonight
You could survive tonight
I'll be your highs tonight
I'll be your lie tonight
Unto the sky tonight
I'll take your blows tonight
I'll show you lows tonight
Deceitful lies will not take you there
The secret life of your labia

Open your eyes tonight
You could be wise tonight
You could survive tonight
I'll be your highs tonight
I'll be your lie tonight
Unto the sky tonight
I'll take your blows tonight
I'll show you lows tonight
