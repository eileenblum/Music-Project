This is seedy
This is sacred
And here's the place
My love is hatred
And I can't stop drinking
Cause I can't stop thinking
The triumph of my will
Is the triumph of this pill

Hey now, I'm here to stay
You better pray
Hey now, I'm here to stay
Kiss my ass and pray

You get hooked
You're getting cooked
You get burned, you get shot
Just like the bullet to the tomb
Like the needle and the spoon
I'm longing for the hit
I'm the fly drawn to the... shit

Hey now, I'm here to stay
You better pray
Hey now, I'm here to stay
Kiss my ass and pray

You're feeling pure
And you're in reach
So shut your little mouth
And do not preach
You've got sex
And you're cashing checks
Now, just because you can
Turn this piggy into ham

Hey now, I'm here to stay
You better pray
Hey now, I'm here to stay
Kiss my ass and pray

I wanna pray with you
My love is hatred now
I wanna pray with you
My love is hatred
