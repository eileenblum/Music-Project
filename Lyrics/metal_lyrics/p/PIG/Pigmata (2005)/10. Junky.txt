Your regular attraction's
Now my terrible distraction
From the devil's debt, here it comes
A little deal dressed up as an invitation
Now my final ultimatum
Healing hands now blame me
Shoot, shovel, shut up, baby

Cause I'm a junky
I'm a junky all the time
Now I want it, so come and fuck me
I'm a junky all the time
Now I want it, so come and fuck me

Non-belongers, non-believers
Distant dogs howl distantly
Free to flight, fight, and beg
My open arms, your open legs
Thy silent self-blame slowly seeks
Mouth to mouth, survival weeps
The shortest cut comes to cheat
The blinded beast becomes the priest

Cause I'm a junky
I'm a junky all the time
Now I want it, so come and fuck me
I'm a junky all the time
Now I want it, so come and fuck me
Fuck me
I want it

Your beauty burns into this brain
The loan is paid by hurt and pain
Faith is feeling, fear-stealing
Love is fire, seduce this liar
Rejections lost, retaliation
Fear is rehabilitation

Big god!
Big plan!
Big gun!
Big bang!
You hear!
I'll heal!
But still I'll hang!

I'm a junky all the time
Now I want it, so come and fuck me
I'm a junky all the time
Now I want it, so come and fuck me
