You hit, you hurt, resign
Your crust will crumble into mine
You carve your crime with mine
And one more sucker tows the line
The devil's debt, my little deals
I take my corners on two wheels

Keep it dumb, just one hitch
I am the scratch you could never itch
Keep it dumb, just one hitch
My god is begging me for one more fix

I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby
I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby

I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby
I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby

Vitriol, vice, and virtue
Vitriol, vice, and virtue

Your cure, my sewer
I'll take your time upon the skewer
I fleet so much, and with your touch
This piglet needs to feel your crutch
The crush, the cry
The scream, the lie
The answer crawls out of your eye
The hope, the tricks
My god is begging me for one more fix

I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby
I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby

I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby
I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby

Vitriol, vice, and virtue
Vitriol, vice, and virtue
Vitriol, vice, and virtue

I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby
I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby

I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby
I hate to break, but I can't relate
So I shoot, shovel, and shut up, baby

Vitriol, vice, and virtue
Vitriol, vice, and virtue
Vitriol, vice, and virtue
Vitriol, vice, and virtue
