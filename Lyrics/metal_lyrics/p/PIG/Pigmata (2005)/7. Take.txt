Welcome back, my friends
To this shit that never ends
There behind the glass
Is the ever spreading ass
Your thrills in hoc, we got electroshocks
Golden worlds and shit-filled pearls
Hands that steal and mouths that heal
So step right up and baby, you will feel...whole
I am your hole!

We got high flown airs, electric chairs
Hooks and whores, fucks and laws
Stay, shut up and take a little token
Keep your mouth shut baby
And your legs wide open

To the lonely preach, my sweet fake
Every dollar, we will take

Welcome back my, friends
To our sordid little end
We got hits and writs and lines of shit
A twisted take and a sweet mistake
We've got a serpent, sinner, loser, winner
Drunk or sober, it's never over
I'm whole

To the lonely preach, my sweet fake
Every dollar, we will take

Well, our thinking's slow
Our drinking's fast
Hope your torture truly lasts
You want reward
You want pain
We want risk
And we want veins

Keep your eyes shut, here's a little token
Keep your mouth shut, baby
And your legs wide open

Keep your eyes shut, here's a little token
Keep your mouth shut, baby
And your legs wide open

Dream on, baby
Dream on, baby, dream on
Dream on, baby
Dream on, baby, dream on

To the lonely preach, my sweet fake
Every dollar, we will take

Dream on, baby, dream on
Dream on, baby
Dream on, baby, dream on
