Anytime that you want anything
Everything you will lose
Anything that you choose
Anything you say you believe
Ask and you will receive
You will receive, so close your eyes and believe

Mistress of the mattress mambo
Tear me with the torture tango
Paid my dues and the rent
Itâs hell-bent, but heaven sent
Young, dumb, full of cum
White trash, cultural flash
Rum bum and the latch
White trash, we want cash

With that smile on your face
And cum in your hand
With a promise and gun
I unload and cum

You can file and accuse
With your interest and dues
The front row of my misery show
Iâm the one you can blow, you can blow

Mistress of the mattress mambo
Tear me with the torture tango
Paid my dues and the rent
Itâs hell-bent, but heaven sent
Young, dumb, full of cum
White trash, cultural flash
Rum bum and the latch
White trash, we want cash

Plastic panties, rubber rules
I like to feel stiletto heels
High ho, here we go
Your silver lining, your perfect timing
Hollow lies, I've got to fly(?)
The heart desires my, mind denies
Watch your throat, it needs to choke
Your smiling eyes will lead you to mine

Mistress of the mattress mambo
Tear me with the torture tango
Paid my dues and the rent
Itâs hell-bent, but heaven sent
Young, dumb, full of cum
White trash, cultural flash
Rum bum and the latch
White trash, we want cash
