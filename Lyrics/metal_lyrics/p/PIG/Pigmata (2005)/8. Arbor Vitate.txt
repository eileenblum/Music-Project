This is the good for my belief
This is the gun for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing one is for fun... fun... fun!

POW POW!
Easy come
POW POW POW!
Easy go
POW POW!
Easy come
POW POW POW!
Easy go

This is the good for my belief
This is the gun for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing one is for fun

I am the town that loves to lie
That shame passed by
This is the city where the windows weep
The only answer to my conceit

My god is good
My god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good
My god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight

This is the good for my belief
This is the gun for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing one is for fun

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I could kill someone tonight
Slip and slide to the hurt and high
Run around with a switchblade
Come with you in the morning light

My god is good
My god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good
My god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight

This finger itches for the spike and soon
In this city where you weep
Into the womb that is your only tomb

My god is good
My god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight
My god is good
My god is right
He'll give me what I need tonight

This is the good for my belief
This is the gun for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing one is for fun

This is the good for my belief
This is the gun for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing one is for fun

This is the good for my belief
This is the gun for my relief
This is the god
This is the gun
One is for killing one is for fun

My god is good
My god is right

God! Good!
God! Right!
