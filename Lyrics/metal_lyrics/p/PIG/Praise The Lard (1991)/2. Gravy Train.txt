I hear the dog barking tonight
The first foot forward is the right
The blood in the sands and the broken crutch
The blood on my hands - whose magic touch?

Yeah yeah my my my - gasoline is burning
Yeah yeah my my my - listen to the mother cry
Yeah yeah my my my - gasoline is burning
Yeah yeah my my my - listen to the mother cry

Be - bop - a - lula that's our gravy train
To the place where desperation reigns
Be - bop - a - lula deliver me from evil
For slime is this kingdom
The incubus waiting to fly

I've been ground down honey
I've been wound round your little finger

I hear the dog is fighting tonight
The first fist forward is the right
I see the would of lies through Judas' eyes
My life in your hands, your knife in my glands

Be - bop - a - lula that's my gravy train
To the place where desperation reigns
Be - bop - a - lula break the daisy chain
The is the place where desperation rains
Down
Down
Down
Down
