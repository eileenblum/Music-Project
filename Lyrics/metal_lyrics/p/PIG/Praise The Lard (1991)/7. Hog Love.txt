Hi there - pretty thingy
Yer lookin' sweet and sorely tangy
Adopt me - I'll make yer happy
I'll take yer home - I'll be yer puppy

Hey ho - hungry bunny
Yer lickin' lips come laced with honey
Allow me to fill yer tummy
Just like yer daddy did to mummy

Hog love - pays a penance
Passion ends - begins repentance
Hog love - frenzy vengeance
Squirt and squeeze and squeal for assistance

Hey hey - baby beastie
I'm on ma knees - I'm feelin' priestly
Bless me - I'll be yer fairy
Yer Holy Ghost and you'll be Mary

Wo wo - kinky kitty
I'm runnin' low on immorality
Forgive me for bein' pushy
Can't live without a little sushi

Hog love - pays a penance
Passion ends - begins repentance
Hog love - frenzy vengeance
Squirt and squeeze and squeal for assistance
