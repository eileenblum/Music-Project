You've been lied to spied on crucified and railed at
And he'll spit on the words of your hopeless excuses
Wrong or right? Day over night?
Who cares? It's a one-sided fight
You got full specification black hole rules
Your world's gonna be his thermal pool
Wasted lives make waste
Spare a dime - You're wasting time
You've got a right to cry - you're gonna die
As he seeps and creeps through the desert sand
And he'll be whistling through your lungs tonight
While the lights go out across the land

T-O-X-I-C-O
T-O-X-I-C-O
Toxico no no no
Toxico yeah yeah yeah yeah

He's got a catalogue of crimes
From corporate grimes
And six billion shares in oblivion
Your dividend is a life of hell
With a rotten rope and a broken bell
Ignorance brews a wicked potion
Stupidity is the mother of devotion
Want not - waste not
It's total liquidation back to backwards

Toxico - that cute pariah
Toxico - he's the sweetest liar
This is trial by fire
In a kingdom of cash
Toxico - with that holy face
The rotten apple is the human race
Your illegitimate human son of greed
He'll give you pyaemia
Sapraemia
Septicaemia
Leukemia

Toxico is highly elated!
Toxico is intoxicated...
He's burstin' out of his boots
With his crashes to ashes and lust for dust
You'll be crawling across the face of this furnace
Begging for mercy - digging for death
He'll wrap his fingers round your neck
And squeeze... 'till your last breath

He'll give you shocks and stares teenage airs
Golden wares radiation scares
He's a permanent emergency coming you
You're permanantly impotent to what he'll do
He hangs around outside school gates
Peddling sweet inticing bait
With four headed piggies waiting in the wings
Mutations are such lovely things

Toxico - that sweet pariah
Toxico - he's the sweetest liar
This is trial by fire
In a kingdom of cash
Toxico with that holy face
The rotten apple is the human race
Your illegitimate human son of greed
Malignant Maligner - cancerous refined
He's your illegitimate human son of greed
He'll give you pyaemia
Sapraemia
Septicaemia
Leukemia
Toxico with that holy face
The rotten apple is the human race
Your illegitimate human son of greed
Toxico!
