I never knew... I never knew
Sweat and sour sweet and empty
Never knew how I felt till I tried
Never knew what I felt 'till I cried
Never knew what I could do 'till I lied lied lied
'Cos its sweet and empty
This is sweat and sour
Sweet and empty... lies a plenty... oh yeah

Oh I never knew what I felt 'till I tried
Never knew what I could do 'till I cried
'Cos he doused himself in gasoline
And it rained down salt and souls
Empty or whole alive but alone oh yeah

Sweat and sour
Sweet and empty
