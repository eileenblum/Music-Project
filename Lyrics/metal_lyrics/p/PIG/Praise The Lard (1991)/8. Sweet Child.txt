I see evil...
I hear... evil
I see evil...
I hear... evil
My child... my love... my child

I wanna be more than I am
I wanna give more than I can
I wanna let you live your life
Though day is over and it is night
Through trial, temptation
You're the one, my redemption
People talk of wrong or right
The gods have flown, they've taken fright
Left you little one alone
To fend and die on your own

I'm gonna love you now and ever
I'm gonna hold myself together
Wrap my soul around you
Hold you tightly through the night
I'm gonna love you now and ever
Hold you all the days I have
We're gonna be together now
But I'll love you forever

I wanna be more than I am
I wanna give more than I can
I wanna let you live your life
Though day is over and it is night
Sweet child
My child
My love

I wanna be more than I am
I wanna give more than I can
I wanna let you live your life
Though day is over and it is night
Through trial, temptation you're the one
My redemption
People talk of wrong or right
The gods have flown, they've taken fright
Left you little one alone
To fend and die on your own
