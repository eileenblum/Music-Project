Well I'm the prim faced mealy mouthed political
Chiseler the lack luster loser
With the selfish streak
The oldest strongest vilest longest

I just masticate on a murdered mind
This mind of mine

I'm scrapin' I'm cryin'
You're laughin' we're dyin'
In the valley of the void the vacuus
The souped up solid suburban nightmare
This is the city of the hateful dead
Follow the pogrom the finger's on me
A catalyst for a little blood lust
The final chapter of your history

I lie lie lie lie lie in the valley of the ignoramus
I cry cry cry cry cry take a look at the
Lives of the sick and dangerous

One little piggy goes to market
One little piggy stays at home
One little piggy sits in the middle
All messed up and ready to blow
Chewing on the carcass of disbelief
Drowing in the bile of lonesome grief
A young head - dead shoulders
Dead eyes growing colder

I lie lie lie lie lie in the valley of the ignoramus
I cry cry cry cry cry take a look at the
Lives of the sick and dangerous
I lie lie lie lie lie in the valley of the ignoramus
I cry cry cry cry cry take a look at the
Lives of the sick and dangerous

Bitter and better for you hate and never for me
I'm corroding...
I'm goin' hell for leather in the nothin' zone
I see concentrated bigotry
Masticating on a murdered mind
You take the grain I take the pain

I lie lie lie lie lie in the valley of the ignoramus
Don't you wanna cry cry cry cry cry
Take a look at the life of the sick and dangerous
I lie lie lie lie lie in the valley of the ignoramus
