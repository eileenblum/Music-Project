With a temper like that
There's trouble to come
You'll have your eyes wide open
And your belly to the sun
With that attitude
There's trouble to come
You'll have your mouth wide open
And your best suit on

Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?
Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?

The last one hired
Is the first one fired
Everybody say why
Everybody say why
If we're late to brake
Could be the last mistake
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna die

Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?
Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?

We need a fountain of miracles
A fountain of miracles
We need a fountain of miracles
A fountain of miracles

Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?
Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?

Rhapsody in rhythm
His loving hand is given
Rhapsody in rhythm
My dirty soul is smitten
Take your pity from the mount
Pick your misery from the mouth
The devil dances on an empty pocket
They eyeballs jumping outta their sockets
I feel the urge of suicide
We're on the verge of genocide
You're under my skin
Tell the next of kin
I'm under this gun
I'm under this knife
From the blackest rocks
Shines the brightest lights

Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?
Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?

Shake me lord is there something I should know?
Shake me lord is there something I should know?
Shake me lord is there something
Shake me lord is there something
Shake me lord is there something I should know?

We drink together
We stink together
We breed together
We bleed together
We swing together
We cling together
We work together
We hurt together
We mate together
We hate together
We break together
We fake together
We cry together
We lie together
We gain together
We stain together
Crawl
Breed
Brawl
Bleed
Make
Steal
Hate
Squeal
Fear
Slay
Love
Prey

Well I just wanna hear you say
Hey, tell me lord
What should I know?
