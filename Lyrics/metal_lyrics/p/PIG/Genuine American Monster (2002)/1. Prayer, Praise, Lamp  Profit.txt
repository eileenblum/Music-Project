Death does all the talking
It'll fuck you free
The secret of the senseless
Soiled sick, I see

Little lux Europe
Put your flesh on steel
Confusion is confession
I'll drive you wheel to wheel

The price is prejudicial
Hear the silent sing
With the spit and spat on
Burning broken wings

I defecate where you will dream
Prayer, praise, and profits prey
Take the pleasure's largest measure
Prayer, praise, and profits prey

Every hole is barred
See, your heart is tarred
Lying in the lap of hate
Where your skin is scarred

I defecate where you will dream
Prayer, praise, and profits prey
Take the pleasure's largest measure
Prayer, praise, and profits prey

Death does all the talking
It'll fuck you free
The secret of the senseless
Soiled sick, I see

Little lux Europe
Put your flesh on steel
Confusion is confession
I'll drive you wheel to wheel
