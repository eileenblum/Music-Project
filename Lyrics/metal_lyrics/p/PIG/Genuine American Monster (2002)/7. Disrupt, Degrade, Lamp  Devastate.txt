Hid behind the curtain's call
The skinny stripper sells it all
The labor's cheap, profit steep
Holy father, look some more
Your foot's already in the door
Scraping now upon your knees
Squeeze and splutter as you stall
As you cum, you feel and fall

Sip the cup of sorrow's sins
Spill the spoon of grief that thins
The voice that lectures now does plead
The chemical of sexual need

Take the letter, take the law
Beaten, bitter, broken, raw
Hold the gun, now we're level
Dine and dance with the devil
Take the letter, take the law
Beaten, bitter, broken, raw
Hold the gun, now we're level
Dine and dance with the devil

On the dreams that you impale
The poison water of your grail
Your god proposed, you disposed
Took the thorn and bled the rose
Close the hand, deny the need
Tape the mouth that you should feed
The self that smothers you with praise
Turns to hypocrite today

Disrupt, degrade, and devastate
Your open arms are full of hate
The master black belt in tongue-fu
Tell the lie until it's true

Take the letter, take the law
Beaten, bitter, broken, raw
Hold the gun, now we're level
Dine and dance with the devil
Take the letter, take the law
Beaten, bitter, broken, raw
Hold the gun, now we're level
Dine and dance with the devil
