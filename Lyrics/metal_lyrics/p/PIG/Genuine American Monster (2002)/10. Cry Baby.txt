[Translated Into English]

I haven't stopped crying
It happens sometimes
After dark
When my mind goes places
I'd like to go
I close my eyes
And dream I'm crying
Lying close to you
Lying

I close my eyes
To stop the tears
That should have stopped
When I stopped loving you
I close my eyes
To forget
Crying over you
And I do
But I lie

I haven't looked back since I got out
But I go back there sometimes
Picking up pieces I dropped
Broke
Forgot
And I think
I'd like to take you back there
To get lost
Where you'd cry
Like I cry

Don't touch me
Nothing touches me
Cause I cry, baby
