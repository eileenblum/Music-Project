One barren furrow to plow
It hurts and then how
Well, I got the time
But I ain't got the temper
Soak me in sweat
The sin, the glitter
Your secret is senseless
The noose is a necklace
Salambo
Salambo
Salambo
P-I-G
PIG!

Get up, do the walking
This dead man is talking
Syphilis will sing
For the misery you bring
Like the drug, like the rush
This hem that you touch
Fantastic, bombastic
The devil in plastic
Salambo
Salambo
Salambo
P-I-G
PIG!
P-I-G
PIG!

With a fistful of luck
You'll kneel and say "suck"
Add a taste of the money
You're a fly in the honey
Your settlement, a sellout
So duly deny
Your loss is your need
You bleed where you please
Salambo
Salambo
Salambo
Salambo
Salambo
P-I-G
PIG!
P-I-G
PIG!
