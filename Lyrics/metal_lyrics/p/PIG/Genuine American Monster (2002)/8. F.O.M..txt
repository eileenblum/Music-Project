Give me your wasted life
Give me your tainted knife
Give me your guiltless greed
Your bloated, bleeding need

Give me your wasted life
Give me your tainted knife
Give me your guiltless greed
Your bloated, bleeding need

This is the time, the killing season
Where's the rhyme, where's the reason?
Your filthy hearts deceiving
The void that you believe in

Pour some pity on your pain
Nothing hurts like nothing gained
Now you've had your little treat
The rancid halo crowns your feet

Disinformation dominates
The fungus that you emanate
Your envy evens up the score
Your hating heart just begs for more

Mercy waits beyond the gate
And every time, it's always late
The weakest link breaks the chain
A little flash, a little flame
Come forward, bless your head
Six lead lepers colored red
Glitter sweat and sin, you are
Your whoring heart just begs for more

Give me your wasted life
Give me your tainted knife
Give me your guiltless greed
Your bloated, bleeding need

Give me your wasted life
Give me your tainted knife
Give me your guiltless greed
Your bloated, bleeding need

My stumbling blocks your stepping stone
The architect sits slone
Take your time, tame the torture
Now the crime amends to slaughter
This long confession will call
Through bluing lips and layered spite
Penetrate, remonstrate
On tender lives you defecate

The spectre of democracy
Whose empire is obscurity
Glitter, sweat, and sin, you are
Your cannon canonized no more

Give me your wasted life
Give me your tainted knife
Give me your guiltless greed
Your bloated, bleeding need

Give me your wasted life
Give me your tainted knife
Give me your guiltless greed
Your bloated, bleeding need

Your corpse is colored red
Corrode corruption's words
The burning light is blurred
The sick survive unheard

Your corpse is colored red
Corrode corruption's words
Envy opens the door
Just a little bit more

Just a little bit more
