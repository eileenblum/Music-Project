I've earned me an armful
Boom boom boom
Get me a sample
Zoom zoom zoom
Bring me once more to the breach
The tarred and bitter bite of shame
Turn one more trick and you could teach
Your piss poor parody of blame
Get down, shut up, baby, learn
I'll absolve while you observe
Take this pork on your fork
Take your sides and hitch a ride
Cut this cord and we will spill
The juice that holds the little thrill

Squeeze into the guilt that holds me
The twisted arms that you have sold me
The broken bridge you take me through
These fickle, foaming lies told by you

Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you

This little piggy goes boom boom boom
Hide you hope and it's zoom zoom zoom
The door of dismal daily strife
Open for this hopeless life
All dressed up in blood stained silk
The diva of his dirt and ilk
In the gut and gristle on this ground
Where I've been lost, but now I'm found

Squeeze into the guilt that holds me
The twisted arms that you have sold me
The broken bridge you take me through
These fickle, foaming lies told by you

Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you

I got little thing just for you
I hope you're gonna think this through
Hold your nerve and hold your serve
Suck this thing that you don't deserve
Mismanaged miscreant's mistake
Misconduct missed in misery

Flesh fest
Flesh fest
Flesh fest
Flesh fest

The broken bridge you take me through
These fickle, foaming lies told by you

Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you
Flesh fest
Just like you
