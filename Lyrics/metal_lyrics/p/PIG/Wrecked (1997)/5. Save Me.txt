Tonight, take all of this, get drunk
Tonight, I wish, you will, I am, you'll kill
Tonight
Tonight, you cut the heart of hurt
Tonight, inside, denied, I'll wash in you

Never hear me
Never see me
Never near me
Never feel me
Never touch me
Never heal me
Never hurt me
Never save me

Tonight
Tonight, you hurt, you'll heal, how does it feel
I hear the words that stay unsaid

Never hear me
Never see me
Never near me
Never feel me
Never touch me
Never heal me
Never hurt me
Never save me
