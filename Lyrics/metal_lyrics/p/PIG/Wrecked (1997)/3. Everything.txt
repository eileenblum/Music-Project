Everything you give, everything you bleed, I need
Everything you hate, everything you hurt, I love
Everything you cut, everything you kill, I feel
Everything you burn, every little bribe, I lose

Everything you want, everything you waste, I need
Everything you saw, everything you say, I hear
Everything you make, everything that's mine, I break
Everything you leave, everything you love, I hate

Don't you wanna fill every little vein, I do
Don't you wanna suck every little hole, I do
Don't you wanna crave, don't you wanna crawl, I do
Don't you wanna break every little bone, I do

Everything you give, everything you bleed, I need
Everything you hate, everything you hurt, I love
Everything you cut, everything you kill, I feel
Everything you burn, every little bribe, I lose
Every little nail, every little slip, I fail
Every little nail, every little slip, I fail
With every little nail, every little slip, I fail
With every little nail, every little slip, I fail
I fail
