I cannot hurt but it don't mean nothing
I cannot hide but it don't mean nothing

I cannot hurt I cannot feel
Come kiss the cut I will heal
One poison pill bedlam burns
I clutch the cradle of corrosion
Never again comes again and again, again

Hatred hangs high but it don't mean nothing
Tied to the guilt edged crime means nothing

I cannot hurt I cannot feel
Come kiss the cut I will heal
One poison pill bedlam burns
I clutch the cradle of corrosion
Never again comes again and again, again

Reinforce need but it don't mean nothing
Sign on the line but it don't mean nothing

I cannot hurt I cannot feel
Come kiss the cut I will heal
One poison pill bedlam burns
I clutch the cradle of corrosion
Never again comes again and again, again
