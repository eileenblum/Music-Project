I am the glutton dressed as glam
The mutton and the ham
My table's broke not turning
My skin is crawling burning

And though I stand for nothing
I will fall for anything
Tequila, a little more lime
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine

No one gets out of her alive
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
No one gets out of her alive

Absolved in absinthes I
My crippled crew in carnage cry
One more drink or surely die
Now steer me through that needle's eye

And then sit on the shit and shat on
And broke apart for the broken
And Satan begs to save us
As Jesus cannot please us

Salvation turns to degradation
Fill the rig, feel the dig
Inebriate me one more time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine

No one gets out of her alive
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
No one gets out of her alive

My steak filled slut likes little mouths
Spouts sticky stained pornography
To force my bruised and aching head
To suck both barrels and the lead

My sweet assassin superdog
Whose little tail will wag this hog
And roll me over one more time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine

I am the glutton dressed as glam
The mutton and the ham
My table's broke not turning
My skin is crawling burning

And though I stand for nothing
I will fall for anything
Tequila, a little more lime
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine

No one gets out of her alive
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
No one gets out of her alive
