My bloated bloody blinding lies
Baptize a bruised and broken mind
My poison pie is in the sky
Now cross my heart I hope to die

Cruel knives crave cruel wives
The bitter stone braves bitter eyes
My feeble filthy little hands
Hide my dirty little plans

With your fear
With your fist
And a flick of your wrist
Get down dirty and wrecked

Broken on my bleeding lips
Drown my words like sinking ships
In stinking shame I wash the blame
In the lonely gutter of my guilt

I will endure while you enjoy
The words you skewer in my head
The blood that's spilt within this bed
Come drink with me until I'm dead

With your fear
With your fist
And a flick of your wrist
Get down dirty and wrecked

The cramping cull the weeping wall
The barrel's bottom where I will fall
The festering eye the poison tongue
Taste the loss that I have won

Take a needle and knit some trouble tonight
Change the pattern but the suit's the same
I'm sucking I'm greedy I'm pushing I'm needy
I'm sucking I'm greedy I'm pushing I'm needy

With your fear
With your fist
And a flick of your wrist
Get down dirty and wrecked

Wrecked!
Wrecked!
Wrecked!
Wrecked!
