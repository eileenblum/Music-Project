You are the blood inside my head
The stain that seeps into this bed
You bring me down to my knees
Take the sickness and disease

You are the trigger for the crime
Into the liquid lake of lead
You are the damage and the dirt
You are the thing I cannot hurt

Everything you touch
Everything you see
Everything you are is enough for me
Everything you seek
Everytime you bleed
I get down and pray for protection

I confess to contempt
When you bleed me
You think it hurts
But you need me
In contempt
When you bleed me
You think it hurts
But you need me

I am the drought upon the seed
I am the leper left unseen
Stupidity is all I heed
This broken vein that you try to bleed

One more bitter cup of bile
Before you crawl your famine mile
The endless bottle and the gun
Works anytime for anyone

Everything you touch
Everything you see
Everything you are is enough for me
Everything you seek
Everytime you bleed
I get down and pray for protection

I confess to contempt
When you bleed me
You think it hurts
But you need me
In contempt
When you bleed me
You think it hurts
But you need me
