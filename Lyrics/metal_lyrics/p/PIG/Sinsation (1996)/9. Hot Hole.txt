I never thought that it would come to this
The spike, the spoon, the darkening room
Holed up in my mecca of misery - motel hell
Dancing for the drunken, diseased, and the doomed

I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
Hot hole!
Hot hole!
Hot hole!
Hot hole!

I never thought I would confide in you
Suckled as I am by the righteous roots of envy
And I never thought that it would ever ring true
The more you help me, the more I hate you

I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
Hot hole!
Hot hole!
Hot hole!
Hot hole!

I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed I'd confide in you
I never thought that it would ever ring true
That you could hurt me, the way I wanna hurt you
I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would it would come to this
Hot hole!
Hot hole!
Hot hole!
Hot hole!

I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
I never dreamed it would come to this
