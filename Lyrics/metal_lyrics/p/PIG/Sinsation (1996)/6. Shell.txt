Young lips drink deeply on the bitter waters of hate
Suspicion and despair
Those lungs choked on the stale stench of poison and decay
Oh Lord, don't give me what I deserve
Give me something I need
Don't give me what I deserve
Give me something I need
Oh Lord, don't give me what I deserve
Give me something I need
Oh Lord, don't give me what I deserve
Come give me something I need
Give me something I need
Give me something I need
Give me something I need
You take everything that you see
And break it into pieces for me
Break it into pieces
Tear me piece by piece
Don't give me what I deserve
Give me something I need
Oh Lord, don't give me what I deserve come give me something I need
Come give me something I need
Come give me something I need
Come give me something I need
