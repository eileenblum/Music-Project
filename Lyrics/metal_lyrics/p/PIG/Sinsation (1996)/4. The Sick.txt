Don't think I can't see through you
Don't think you would ever fool me
I'll get what's coming to me

From the womb, unto the tomb
The stagnant air that fills the room
Into the shrine where you have knelt
You felt the buckle, now feel the belt

Your deepest cut will leave no mark
This sceptic skin will never scar
Come breathe some light into my dark

Be penitent and penetrate
Between the liquor and all these lies
See past the bruises of your hate
Come face to face and meet your fate

The weak will walk
The sick will see
Caress my cursed soul for me
These begging hands will prey with glee
Upon your blackened fists and knees

This sleuth hound is the Lord of lies
This boiling pot will draw the flies
Write one more check before you die

The weak will walk
The sick will see
Caress my cursed soul for me
These begging hands will prey with glee
Upon your blackened fists and knees

Be penitent and penetrate
Between the liquor and all these lies
See past the bruises of your hate
Come face to face and meet your fate

The weak will walk
The sick will see
Caress my cursed soul for me
These begging hands will prey with glee
Upon your blackened fists and knees

Don't think I can't see through ya
Do ya think I'd ever fool ya?
You'll get what's coming to ya
You'll get what's coming to ya
You'll get what's coming to ya

The weak will walk
The sick will see
Caress my cursed soul for me
These begging hands will prey with glee
Upon your blackened fists and knees
