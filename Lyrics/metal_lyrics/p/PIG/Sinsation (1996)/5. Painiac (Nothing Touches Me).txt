Why don't you do what I want you to do?
Why don't you see me the way that I see you?
Why don't you say what I want you to say?
Why don't you hurt me in that special way?

Come on and be my god
Come on and be my gun
One is for killing
One is for fun

Too scared to walk away
Too scared to stay

Why don't you soak me in the stain of your twisted mind?
Why don't you coat me in the blood of your broken shrine?
Why don't you cut me the way I wanna cut you?
Why don't you fuck me the way I wanna fuck you?

Come on and be my god
Come on and be my gun
One is for killing
One is for fun

Too scared to walk away
Too scared to stay

Nothing touches me
