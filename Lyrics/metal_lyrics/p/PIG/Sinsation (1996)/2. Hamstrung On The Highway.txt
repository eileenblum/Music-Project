See the long, thin shadow of the reaper
See the long, thin shadow of the rope
I feel the finger of hunger
I feel the blade upon this throat

Shut the door upon my face
Stoke the boiler of this pain
Put the fuel upon the flame
I'll get a grip
I'll get a gun
Get a gun
I'll get a gun
Get a gun

Put the muzzle to my head
In the dark, the dirt, the din
Cut the carcass, suck it in
I'll get a grip
I'll get a gun
Get a gun
I'll get a gun
Get a gun

Give me something to believe
This hope is breaking and is sunk
I'll dive into this long disease
The captain of this ship is drunk

The lion's share of shame
Born to bear the brunt of blame
Filthy is my middle name
I'll get a grip
I'll get a gun
Get a gun
I'll get a gun
Get a gun

Get a gun
Get a gun
Get a gun
Get a gun

See the long, thin shadow of the reaper
See the long, thin shadow of the rope
I feel the finger of hunger
I feel the blade upon this throat

Give me something to believe
This hope is breaking and is sunk
I'll dive into this long disease
The captain of this ship is drunk

I'll get a gun
