This is the dirt that grows the misery that you suck upon
Oh, come to bedlam, you will find a fist to fuck upon
This soul is itchin' to receive the taste upon your spoon
My guilt will marry me and lies are gonna be my groom

O silence, I can hear you
Swinging slowly on the gentle rope

Serial killer thriller
Sinsation
Serial killer thriller

Sinsation
Serial killer thriller
Just for you

And from your bitter string, I suck upon all your bitter lies
And wait with baited, bitter breath upon your bridal knife
I cannot take this thing you force into my face again
I cannot hate this thing you force into my face again
A choir of flies rehearse their hymns upon my open eyes
Your devil crawls to me to give me somewhere I can hide

O silence, I can hear you
Swinging slowly on the gentle rope
