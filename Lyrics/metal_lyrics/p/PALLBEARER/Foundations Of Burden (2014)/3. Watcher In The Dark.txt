Torn through the veil
Corporeal vessel left behind
Into formless void
Branching web of space and time

Wandering away
Wandering deeper inside

Endless open wound
Swirling mass-ten billion eyes
Dismal cosmic tomb
Spines licking astral mind

Wandering away
Wandering deeper inside

Endless and obscured
The watcher in the dark
In the sea of illusion
A voyage to beyond, within
