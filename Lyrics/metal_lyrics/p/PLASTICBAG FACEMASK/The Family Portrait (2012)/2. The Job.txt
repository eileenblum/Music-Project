[feat. Tyler Rowan of Forever Rising]"Oh, dear brother, please. Forgive our beloved father for promising me happiness and health but removing you from home to survive on your own. You went against his values and his love, but he was our father the same. Help me find who ended our family."

"Find someone for me. Make sure he is strong."

"Perform this job for me. In turn for him. You will never get close to the killer. You are a runt like father. Pathetic and weak. Don't return until it is done."

Sent out empty to cold, wet streets. Hunting a man I don't yet know. Is his sentence just or am I as vile as my enemy? I never wish to know this man. Only to discover the destroyer of my world. Interrogating. Hiding. Stalking. My prey is closer every passing minute.
A bludgeoned greeting. The gift of a duct tape jacket. For it's a cold walk to the dump tonight where your remains will equal the garbage.
What will I become for this? This is not a road I dreamt to take. Would my creators judge me? I can not do this. I will not do this. I can not . . .
The moonlight's flash on my victim's frames triggers the site in my mind of the tool of my parent's demise. This fucking scum is nothing more or less than the killer to me. Inch by inch his face caves in. My hand, the molder of flesh and bone. Your end was not worthless, my friend. You will be joined by whom I seek.
