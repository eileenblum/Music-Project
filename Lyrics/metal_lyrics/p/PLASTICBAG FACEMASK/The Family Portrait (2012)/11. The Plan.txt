[feat. Joel Faviere of Get Scared]In a dormant mind. Come on come on, give me hope, to dehumanize, creating prized possessions in my mind. I know, getting injured, hold my grip on vengeance is in key of darker fall. Blood closure. Closure in my mind.

Odds stacked against me at the family gathering. Odds stacked against me in my revenge.

Paranoia. I fear my defenses have been breached. An old friend has perished. And I think I know why.

Infiltration. Discretion. Killer with an invitation. Chameleon.

A party. A remembrance. Let us honor him. I hope I am the only one who knows his dark past. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

Familiar environment. Hire foolish men. Distractions. His deadly heirloom is rightfully mine and will sever him limb from limb. His deadly heirloom in rightfully mine and so is my revenge.
