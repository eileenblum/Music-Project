Could I have been a fool? Trusted too soon? I fear I have been discovered.

A second class member buried in distrust. Falling behind in my mutinous scheme. "Excuse me, Boss. I'll be back soon." Someone close behind. Mind bent on destruction. Following. Heart racing. A stranger. Gun pulled. Aiming at my goal. A shot. A shout. The stranger falls down. My prey still stands. My gun warm. From outcast to savior.
