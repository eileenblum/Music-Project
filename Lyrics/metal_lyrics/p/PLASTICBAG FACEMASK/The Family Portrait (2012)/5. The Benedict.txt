[feat. Noah Sias]"Here it is. This will make or break you. Within these pages you find a man. A man who may have betrayed us. A betrayal to me is a betrayal to you. Do not fret and do not fear. I have seen your craft. You will impress."

In the wild once again. The tail of a man none the wiser of what will be. Darkness approaching. Secrets uncovered and lies revealed. Opposing motives for solitary gain.

"Sir, here's the man stealing from your riches."
"Let me go!"
"Listen to him plead, plead, plead."
"No!"

"No, no, no. You do not speak. You just listen. You think I do not know who you are or what you do? You are the filthy, slithering swine of this organization. If you had a heart I would rip it from your chest and I would make you swallow it whole. I will spew the evil from your guts. I want you to know that I am going to your house tonight and I will slit the throats of your family while they sleep. You will not have a chance to be missed. They will never know you're gone."

"Allow me, sir. Please. I will rid this rat from your world."

"No! I've something just for him. A blade sharp and still stained with blood of old. Allow me."

Wearing a new shade of red. Mind far behind the eyes. A final display of punishment. Lines his ducks in a row.

"Remove this filth from my sight. Heed this though, young man. No one may know. Do not be seen. Do not be heard. Do not be felt."
