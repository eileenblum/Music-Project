No lights shine from these curtained windows. No moon through these clouds. There they lie, unaware of these watchful eyes.

A childhood killed before it began. A royal family left with just one son. What has this act of violence created?

The axe has fallen. Just two strikes. The future holds so much. As blood fills their mouths, I rise.

Footsteps down a frozen hallway. A sick noise shakes a child awake. Ceiling leaks read rain. Crawls out into an evil realm. From the threshold sharpened metal silver. Hiding behind maroon blinds. Young eyes.

As blood fills their mouths, I rise.

What's this? A survivor? Oh, he's but a boy. Enjoy your shitty life. I know your brother will.

So scared, crawl upstairs to where my nightmares breed, find my parents dead, love is dead. Night's moon as bright as his axe that night.
