In over my head, again. The weight of a man on my shoulders. This shroud of darkness could not be thick enough. What do I do? Burned, buried, or diced? Discretely erasing a life. The snap of a twig. The blast of a gun. Two dead, a man and a woman, lie before my feet. Witness. Innocence. What have I done to this man and this woman? Am I now the same as him? One becomes three. Three bodies in the quarry. What have I done? Neglect to check my work. Erase my tracks. Reckless.
