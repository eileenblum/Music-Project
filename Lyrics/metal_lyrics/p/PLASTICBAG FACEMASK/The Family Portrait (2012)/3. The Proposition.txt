So soon my artwork is appreciated by works of a similar medium. I find myself in a dark place on a street I never knew. "Only the finest eat here, Sir." My admirer sits.

Could this be him? A face so young. So bold. So true. An artist with an equal darkness. A voice in his head that tells him of evil.
"I saw your work, oh protege. Though I was the only one. Your attack was well planned, but chaotic with no doubt. Come work for me, for there is no better opportunity in town. Do me this contract and watch yourself rise."

At last, the moment has come to make a name for myself. A shroud. A cloud. To travel in behind my victim's heart. "I accept."
