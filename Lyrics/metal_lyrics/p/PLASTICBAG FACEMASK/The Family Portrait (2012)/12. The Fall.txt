"Come in. You have shown me true respect. You have earned this prize for your allegiance. My eyes are open from this tragedy. This man was my friend. I could perish at any moment. I want you to have my empire when I'm dead. Will you accept?"

A fight breaks below. "You are finished. Through. This empire is mine. Not for you. One fatal mistake. The child you passed. That was me. You should never have come to that home that night."

"What is this? A final betrayal? Who are you?"

"I am your pupil. I am your wealth. I am your nightmare. I am my father's son."

As blood fills my mouth, I fall.
