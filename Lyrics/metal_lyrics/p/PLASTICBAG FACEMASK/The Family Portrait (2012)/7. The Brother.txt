[feat. Tyler Rowan of Forever Rising]"Oh, dear brother, I found him. Your associate, my employer, our neighbor. He is the killer. He ended our father's reign. Rising to this city's throne. With your inherited power we must cause his fall."

"How could you be so blind? I thought you would have been on my side. Maybe I guess just not this time. How could you be so blind? I gave them both enough time to share what should have been mine. All mine. I threw him where you can not find him. I can't believe I did this to him, but I had to. What can I say? What do I do, now?"

"Dad was right to cast you out. Your greed and hatred infested from the start. Now I know the origin of your strength and gold. You disgust me. How dare you sit in his chair, in this tower, in this room? I am finished with your existence."

Another bullet from my scythe. Another piece of family lost.
