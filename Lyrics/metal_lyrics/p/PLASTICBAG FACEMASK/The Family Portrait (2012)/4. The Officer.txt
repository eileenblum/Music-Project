[feat. Nikolai Gawin of James Doesn't Exist]I've finally fucking got you. Too much time spent waiting. No one will convict you of your crimes. And so I'm here to deliver your justice. You think that you could run forever? I'm sick of sitting down, you're done. The courts may buy your bullshit. Tossing your case out with ease. Although there's no formal evidence
I know of all your deeds. And I drink these nights away. Praying to God that I may. Find you in a situation like the one we're in now. Time to die you fuck.

"Kudos."
