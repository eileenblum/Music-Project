Come, Boy, and you shall see the proper ways of this craft. You threw three bodies from a dock? Seek deeper waters and make sure they will not float. Not even fisherman's nets will find the mass graves you leave for this Earth.
I beseech. Don't allow your defenses to be breached. No lights. No noise. This is a job for the dead of night.
Cut them into pieces! Throw them overboard! One bag at a time! Meet the ocean floor!
Now you are a cog in the machine! Now you are the silent killer this world needs!
We send our sins to sink! The sea swallows them whole!
Set them free.
This is the circle of life. The unfortunate truth for those of us in this business. Survival of the fittest and we are the strongest ones.
Thieves sink. Liars sink. Bastards sink. Traitors sink. Never underestimate the power of your will. You can commit so much violence if you just put your mind to it. Try it! Now you know what to do next time. The art of your life and this is your masterpiece.
