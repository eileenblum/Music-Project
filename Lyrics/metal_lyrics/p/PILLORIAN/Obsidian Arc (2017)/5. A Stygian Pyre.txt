All fire burns black

Stygian... the darkest, most cleansing of flame
The scythian light that reaps the herd

Yielding to nothing, amok in its feral walk
Godless and unforgiving with a heart of brimstone

In a purification ritual - cleanse the world of this abomination

All fire burns black
Nothing is darker...

Pyre... the purest, most cleansing of flame
Yielding to nothing, architect of austere carbon bane

Reduced to a grey, delicate ashen reverence
Erased in a seraphic scour of pitch-black fire
