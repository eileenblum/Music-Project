An art of power
An archaic darkened gleam
Shimmers through the cracks of the arcane
Black sun, obsidian storm

The holographic construct of being
An empty space in the glow of clarity
The sentient subconscious wraith is waiting...

In the solar lodge I found the key
That unlocked a celestial domain
It gave me wisdom and the will to soar
High in the face of the gods

I am guided by the light of a black sun
By streams of alchemy and time I am bound

An archway to the mysteries, bridge of enigmatic light
Glimmers through a rift in the umbra
It rains upon the ether in a wash of quiet brood
It blackened storm, obsidian sun

I have been gilded by the light of a black sun
By jaws of the emerald lion I am bound
