There is a river in us all
It flows a crimson ruin through our veins

It is the life blood of suffering
Red magma on a slow course to oblivion

This river, it binds us
It flows through us, feeds us
It gives us health, it gives us life
... and drowns the rest of the world

Tie your hands and suffer
Then break them from the body
Drown your soul in the mire
Until there is nothing left of us here

An empty vessel floats away

Drown your soul in the water
Feel the black mire penetrate your being
Place your hands in the water
The mire of mankind flows on... and on...

... a river...
