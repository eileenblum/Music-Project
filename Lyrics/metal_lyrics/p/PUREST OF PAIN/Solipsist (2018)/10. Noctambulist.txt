Wake up, half-dead again
The shapes amass and reveal a garden of glass
The product of environments, where sweet release is heaven-sent

Hours bleed into days, bleeding into weeks
Will you make do and mend, or find your life is spent?

Wasting time and wanting more, you dread what life has left in store
Wet the thirst and flick the wrist, noctambulist!

I know exactly how this ends
All I need to know is when
And when that time comes, I'll go peacefully
Then will you raise your glass to me?

You're a 'cause, irretrievably lost
And you wouldn't know it was raining, unless you'd open your sick face and let heaven pour in

Wake up, half-dead again
The shapes amass and reveal a kingdom in ruins
The sewage of environments, where sweet release will be your undoing

Pressure leads to tension, leads to pressured inner conflict
Noctambulist!

Wasting time and wanting more, you dread what life has left in store
Wet the thirst and flick the wrist, noctambulist!

I know exactly how this ends
All I need to know is when
And when that time comes, I'll go peacefully
Then will you raise your glass to me?

A self-centred poet, zoned out in the static, to fall on deaf ears, alone and pathetic
Don't waste your last breath on me, 'cause I've had it
If life is a joke, I'm the last one to get it
