Who are we but the cancer of our own dreams?

The forecast seemed degrading, when they said it would be raining
While the storm that is at hand, is one they'd never comprehend
The corpse hung there for hours, its branches were in bloom
And gave birth to bitter flowers, as the winds danced to their tune

We live our nice little lives built on lies swallowed whole
And we wipe our dirty mouths, and keep begging them for more
The new word was a sedative, the masses stood in awe
A bark mistook for poetry, a man mistook for god

And as we set to sail once more, we try to break the tides
And though we'll never reach the shore, this ship will never sink
