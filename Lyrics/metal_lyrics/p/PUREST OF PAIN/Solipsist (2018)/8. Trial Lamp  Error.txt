One mustn't seek for glory in the ever-troubled past, unless one understands the nature of perspective
One mustn't blame the fuel for its ignition, such is the principle of entropy

From a spark will come inferno

Collapse into me, again and again
Icarian absolution, bound to all extremes

One foot in the sea of bloody history
One foot on the righteous path towards a brighter future
I repel all your wicked ways, etched into my DNA
Let's pretend we all believe mankind can in fact be humane

Collapse into me, again and again
Icarian absolution, bound to all extremes

I owe it to myself, to never forget the measure of my worth
My pride-fuelled brush with death, and the breaking of the glass

Trial, error
