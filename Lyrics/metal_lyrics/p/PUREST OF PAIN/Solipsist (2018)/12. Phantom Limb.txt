I traversed Eden as a snake, for I knew unmet desire
So meet me at the gallows, turning envy into ire

My sword dancer, my phantom limb
My raison d'Ãªtre, my sweetest sin

The gift of apathy has yet to hear your plea, and everyone knows it
The curse of empathy has yet to burden me, and no one takes notice

The carrion of unwanted affection, but your brother 'til the end
The carrion of wasted potential, your brother 'til the end

Everything I touch turns to lead

It's hard to hit rock-bottom in a bottomless pit
It's hard to reach for stars, when you're drowning in shit
It's hard to hit rock-bottom in a bottomless pit
It's hard to see the beauty, if you oh so lack the wit

I traversed Eden as a snake, for I knew unmet desire
So meet me at the gallows, turning envy into ire

My sword dancer, my phantom limb
My raison d'Ãªtre, my sweetest sin

Everything I've built, I'm prepared to commit to ashes
Everything I've built, I would tear it down for you

You're my phantom limb
