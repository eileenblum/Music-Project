A creature washed ashore on these lands
Formless hollow, eager to grow
Hungry to learn, but soon it will wish
For the tide to drag it back

How much longer will the sun set
On our unsustainable paradise

For at every dusk I bid her farewell
Hoping this time will be the last
Last time I see, last time I speak
Last time find myself
Lost in the pit at the precipice of guilt
No light to dull my senses
Ready once again to claw my way up
And swarm back to the nothing that we call our home

Sisyphean bones whose sinews gave motion to the progress of man
They will splinter, they will falter
Those bones will break - every time

Is there hope left for mankind?
They will fall every time
Is there hope left yet for man?
There is none
They will fall
They will fall every time

And angels will orbit their celestial corpse
Like vultures attending a swan song

For he who takes up arms against his kin
Will suffer tenfold
Surely suffer tenfold

A creature washed ashore on these lands
Bitter at heart blood on its hands
Hands that have learned only to hurt
Hands that will stain the seed of the earth

And plague will follow
In its every footstep

Sisyphean bones whose sinews gave motion to the progress of man
Will break every time
