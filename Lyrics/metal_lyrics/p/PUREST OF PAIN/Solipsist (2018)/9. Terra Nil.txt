[Lyrics: J.D. Kay, music: Merel Bechtold, guest vocals: Sam C.A.]

No warmth is found by these screens bound
We are wishing ourselves away
This Terra Nil, it haunts me still
Don't be taken aback, by the monochromatic waves, pouring from blinds to the streets

They're easily mistaken for signs of life, but no such life blooms here
Terra Nil, or year zero come again
How much further will we fall?

Terra Nil, a generation starved on fear
One day soon it will swallow us whole
A world where suicide is seen as tax-evasion
Where we won't address the immorality of pro-creation

With curtains drawn we numb our sons and daughters on prescription
The wise are shunned, the fools they march us onward to extinction

Take my flesh, take my bones, take my thoughts, they're all yours
I have tried to believe, but I've failed miserably

Terra Nil, or year zero come again
How much further will we fall?
Terra Nil, a generation starved on fear
One day soon it will swallow us whole
