Hate, betrayal, malicious intent
These were a few of my closest friends
Hate, betrayal, malicious intent
I tried so hard to believe that you wouldn't sink to this

An eight year struggle to help and protect
How many years can you give me back?

The depths you'll sink never fail to amaze
My only mistake was to think that you could change

A toast in your honour, a knife in the back
Intention or ignorance, it doesn't change the fact that you're all wine and no bread
You're words are golden, but your deeds are lead

I want my life back

A crown of worms, so gracefully upon your head
If you believe that wounds heal quicker, when shared with friends

You shit where you eat and you've poisoned your well
You flee your own scene 'cause you can't stand the smell
Don't question your motives or clean up your act
Drenched in self-pity and loss of respect

A crown of worms, so gracefully upon your head
If you believe that wounds heal quicker, when shared with friends

The only king you'll ever be, in your cardboard castle and your piss-stained sheets
The only crown you'll ever wear, a crown of worms
