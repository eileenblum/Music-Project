I am a universe, from its inception to the hearse
And with a shield of my own ego, I'll march unto the endless ether

I'm not in search for the validity of my own being, nor do I seek to verify the terms of my existence

'Cause when it falls apart, and it will fall apart, these answers won't abide
'Cause when I fall apart, everything will fall with me, and its renewal an uncertainty

I am the alpha of my own doctrine
I am the alpha, I am the infinite

I am the god I fear, the heart of the all tearing at the seams
I am the god I fear, the self-devouring serpent

I have become the solipsist, event horizon of self-perception
And as I wander through my own creation, awe oft gives way to shame

I have become the solipsist, event horizon of self-perception
I have become the solipsist, the epitome of self-importance

I am a universe, from its inception to the hearse
And with a shield of my own ego, I'll march unto the endless ether

Upon the infinite white, a lonely satellite
Patient, but not without reason

I have become the solipsist, the god I fear is me
March unto the endless ether
