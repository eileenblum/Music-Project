Splitting time as the molecules divide and will reform to their comprehensive being.
Between now and then a new world reforms as the stars propagate to a new diverseness.

Travel between two worlds, two open dimensions to roam.
In twilight continuously, different worlds, alike.

Far peaks of the mountains, an outstretched sea of green.
While the moon rules the tide, Utopia shall be mine.

Smoke rises to the sky, screams of anguish from afar.
When I enter my sea of green, bloodshed and war like I had never seen.

So the camouflage is revealed, green and blue from afar.
But when I pull myself near it's the grey truth, bitter and austere.

Wandering through parallel dimensions.
An ancient patron repeating: we are the behemoths.

A destructive urge need to feed our dominance.
Building up a history of failure, forevermore.

As I reach the earth's atmosphere I don't see the warm green and blue.
It's grey, dark and rotten to the core.
Yes, it's the world you made!

Splitting time as the molecules divide and will reform to their comprehensive being.
Between now and then an new world reforms as the stars propagate to a new diverseness.

Lava bursting from its giants, fog covers the planet.
The four moons now gathered it's the red sun which shall reign.

Hideous primordial creatures peeling off each other's skin.
Thoroughly repulsive in every way as the grotesque took a new form.

Wandering through parallel dimensions.
An ancient patron repeating: we are the behemoths.

We are the same.
No difference between non-creatures, mankind.
We are alike.
We are the same in every way.
Non-creature, mankind are alike.
The deeds, the acts, the ways of greed.
Two dimensions divided as one.
