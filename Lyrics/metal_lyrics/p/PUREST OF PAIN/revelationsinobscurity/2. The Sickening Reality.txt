Sick is the mind.
Hollow is the way we're living.
For decades to come without any change.

For sin to molest.
To grow for decay.

Wealth.
Submission.
Murder.
Reality.

My world, the fall, it's going backwards.
In shadows, they crawl, spiral downwards.
My, backwards.
In shadows downwards.

Ruins for more to come, as life gets further away from the past and we know there's no coming back.
The land is scarred by human debris, by human.

Flesh returns to ash while rage remains unlocked.
Prisoners of the herd while wolves circle around.

For sin to molest.
To grow for decay.

My will, too strong, I won't bow.
Tear the bricks down, we can do without.
Set the spirit free, this is not how it shall be.
We are deranged, a dreadful future to face.

I despise your kind, disturbing the elite.
Repulsive ways to act: blind, deaf, reject.
I despise your kind, disturbing the elite.
Repulsive ways to act: blind, deaf, reject.

One day it will all be over.
Forsaken and polluted as the world collapses.

For sin to molest.
To grow for decay.

My world, the fall, it's going backwards.
In shadows, they crawl, spiral downwards.
My, backwards.
In shadows downwards.

Ruins for more to come, as life gets further away from the past and we know there's no coming back.
The land is scarred by human debris, by human debris.
The land is scarred by human debris.
