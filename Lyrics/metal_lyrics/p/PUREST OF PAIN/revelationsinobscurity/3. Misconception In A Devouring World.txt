Where life and death entwine.
When sorrow brings despair, the rope breaks and its weight falls down.
As the Warmonger caresses the day and the hymn of mourning rises.
There is mankind with its technological downfall.

When everything is falling apart and the earth is circling beyond its boundaries.
As the flowing of time stops, there are six billion saviors.
When everything is falling apart and the earth is circling beyond its boundaries.
As the flowing of time stops, there are six billion saviors.

We are so innocent, it's not our fault.
Prepare the final hour as the world burns.

Waste is flowing from the rivers of life.
The future is dark.
No one will survive.
Waste is flowing from the rivers of life.
The future is dark.
No one will survive.

Go on and bring technology so we can make this place better.
Improve our society and nature will shatter.
Glorious is the open land where the landscape is so enchanting.
White are the mountains in the sunrays.
A grey oppression is growing.
The city is taking ground.
Our lifeline is ending it is us that fade.

When everything is falling apart and the earth is circling beyond its boundaries.
As the flowing of time stops, there are six billion saviors.
When everything is falling apart and the earth is circling beyond its boundaries.
As the flowing of time stops, there are six billion saviors.

Bear the weight of the earth on our shoulders, doomsday saviors.
Bear the weight of the earth on our shoulders, doomsday saviors.

Lighting will strike.
The earth will strike back.
Carbon made rain degenerates the flesh.
The bowels of decay vomit their putrid stench.
Our hope pulled away by the raging flood.
The earth will strike back.
Carbon made rain degenerates the flesh.
The bowels of decay vomit their putrid stench.
Our hope pulled away by the raging flood.

Bear the weight of the earth on our shoulders, doomsday saviors.
Bear the weight of the earth on our shoulders, doomsday saviors.
