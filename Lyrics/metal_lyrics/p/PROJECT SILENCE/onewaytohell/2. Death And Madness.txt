Everything you did to me
Burning and turning my words
I will not tolerate this anymore
I want out from this hell right now
You gotta run away from me
Run away while you still can
You said it's not what it seems
The hell you've been giving to me

I saw the lies
Everything is just a lie
The secrets you've been keeping
But I will forgive you, if you just die

We are death
We are madness
We are hate
I will not feel your hate
I will not carry your faults
We are death and madness
We are the daughters of hate

Everything you did to me
Bending and turning my words
I will not tolerate this anymore
I want out from this hell right now
You gotta run away from me
Run away while you still can
You said it's not what it seems
The hell you've been giving to me

I am the one
Everything is just a lie
I am the king
Corruption is my name

We are death
We are madness
We are hate
I will not feel your hate
I will not carry your faults
We are death and madness
We are the daughters of hate

Burn, burn, you worm
Madness is rising, do you hear it yet?
Turn, turn, try to squirm
Madness is rising, do you feel it yet?

We are death
We are madness
We are hate
I will not feel your hate
I will not carry your faults
Burn!
