Take your time, scream like animal
Burn, scream, shout, feel, do you pray? Do you feel? Do you pray, do you hear?

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
One way to hell, it's time to get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Your time is up and I will ask this;

Do you really wanna live?
Do you really wanna grieve?
Do you really wanna live this life?
There is only one way to hell
Do you really wanna lie?
Do you really wanna die?
Do you really wanna live in hell?
There is only one way to hell

Take your way, scream like hell
Burn, scream, shout, feel, do you pray? Do you feel?

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
One way to hell, it's time to get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Your time is up and I will ask this;

Do you really wanna live?
Do you really wanna grieve?
Do you really wanna live this life?
There is only one way to hell
Do you really wanna lie?
Do you really wanna die?
Do you really wanna live in hell?
There is only one way to hell

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
One way to hell, it's time to get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Your time is up and I will ask this;

Do you really wanna live?
Do you really wanna grieve?
Do you really wanna live this life?
There is only one way to hell

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
