I will pray for you, I will wait for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, I will decay with you

We may not prosper, but we will prevail

I must bury your memory
And crucify your functions
Press down your thoughts

Flesh of the God

Cruelty and pain
Murdering thoughts
Prey of religion

Prey of the God

Burn your tongue
Purify your heart
Spoil it
Rotting meat is yours

I am the ash of disease
I am the God
I am the end

I will judge for you, I will bleed for you
Before I sacrifice everything
I will be with you, I will rule with you

We may not prosper, but we will prevail

I must bury your memory
And crucify your functions
Press down your thoughts

Flesh of the God

Cruelty and pain
Murdering thoughts
Prey of religion

Prey of the God

Flesh of the God
