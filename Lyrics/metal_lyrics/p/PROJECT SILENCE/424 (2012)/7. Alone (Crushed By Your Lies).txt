I'm alone, in this little death that some may call life
So confused, tattered, torn apart

Still waiting to be lifted from this prison of my flesh
To be set free from this pain

Crushed I am between the sliding doors of life
And the chances I've been given, but still alone

Mistake for a creation
Fault in the product line
Mass-produced , dehumanized
Cast out to oblivion

I can't raise my head up high
I've been pressed down to the ground
Left alone to suffer in the silence of lonely souls

One day I will defeat this everlasting misery and reach for the skies
where you are

Mistake for a creation
Fault in the product line
Mass-produced, dehumanized
Cast out to oblivion

Crushed I am between the sliding doors of life
And the chances I've been given, but still alone

Mistake for a creation
Fault in the product line
Mass-produced, dehumanized
Cast out to oblivion
