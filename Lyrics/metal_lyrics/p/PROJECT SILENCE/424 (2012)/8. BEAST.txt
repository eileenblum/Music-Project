I
am the fear
I
am the devil inside of you

Anything you take away
I will burn
Anything you keep with you
I will burn
Anything you want from me
I will burn
Anything you ever do
I will destroy

I
am the one
I
am the beast

I
am the dark
I
am the worm in your head

Anything you take away
I will burn
Anything you keep with you
I will burn
Anything you want from me
I will burn
Anything you ever do
I will destroy

I
am the fear
I
am the devil
I
am the one
I
am the beast

Anything you take away
I will burn
Anything you keep with you
I will burn
Anything you want from me
I will burn
Anything you ever do
I will destroy

[10x] BEAST

Anything you take away
I will burn
Anything you keep with you
I will burn
Anything you want from me
I will burn
Anything you ever do
I will destroy
