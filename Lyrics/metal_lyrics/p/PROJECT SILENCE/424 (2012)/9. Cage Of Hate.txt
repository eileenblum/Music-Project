End this
Take my life away
Defeat me, with my lust
Darkest lie is just for you
Infest me, with your hate
Slap me in my face, slash me
With the whip of hate

I am so done with you
I am so restless now
Give me the reason to be
Tell me why to be here tonight
Tell me why to bear this night
Tell me the reason for this all

Gods try to be humans
Humans pretending to be gods
Can't play god anymore
Humans play gods
Gods play humans
Humans play gods
Gods play humans
Can't play god anymore

Forget my sins
I know the reason
Just look at me
Take me away from the pain to the grave

Forget my face
I know the grief
Just look at me
Take me away from the pain to the grave

In my cage, I wait my dawn, my death, my warning, warning for my crimes

Should I say
Should I stay
Should I pay
Should I gain it all

Should I pray for you

End this
Take my life away
Defeat me, with my lust
Darkest lie is just for you
Infest me, with your hate
Slap me in my face, slash me
With the whip of hate

I am so done with you
I am so restless now
Give me the reason to be
Tell me why to be here tonight
Tell me why to bear this night
Tell me the reason for this all

Gods try to be humans
Humans pretending to be gods
Can't play god anymore
Humans play gods
Gods play humans
Humans play gods
Gods play humans
Can't play god anymore
