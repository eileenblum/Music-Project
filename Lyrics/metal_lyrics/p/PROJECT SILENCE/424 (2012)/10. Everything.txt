Everything will always be the same for me and
everything will turn out fine
and everything will bring me down
and this life could be mine and yours too and everything

Everything

Everything will always be the same for me and
everything will turn out fine
and everything will bring me down
and hear these words I will promise this right now for you

[2x] I will not believe it when you take me for granted
I will not believe it when you do this to me

Everything will always be the same for me and
everything will turn out fine
and everything will bring me down
and this life could be mine and yours too and everything

Everything

Everything will always be the same for me and
everything will turn out fine
and everything will bring me down
and hear these words; I will promise this right now for you

I keep you here with me
I taste your lips
and kiss your hips
and never turn away from you and
I weep with you and i will never lose you and
I will keep you with me and never hurt you

Everything will always be the same for me and
everything will turn out fine
and everything will bring me down
and this life could be mine and yours too and everything

Everything

Everything will always be the same for me and
everything will turn out fine
and everything will bring me down
and hear these words I will promise this right now for you

[2x] I will not believe it when you take me for granted
I will not believe it when you do this to me
