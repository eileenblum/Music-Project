Shame
Shame on me
Shame on you
Never lick my skin
Between your legs, so wet
Torturing me

[2x] Embrace me, embrace me, embrace me
I am frameless in anyway

They say, that tonight is a cursed night
Devoid of all light
Filled with macabre sights
He told me this night
"Be drenched with fright"
"You won't survive tonight"
Bloodstained beneath the moonlight

Stardancer

Shame
Shame on me
Shame on you
Just lick me
Between your legs, so wet
I am now

Indeed that night, the killings fell
Resistant to fight deceased by midnight

He caressed her that night
"For now you are mine"
As she bled in his sight
"Eternally you are divine"
"In this hellish moonlight"

[2x] Embrace me, embrace me, embrace me
I am frameless in anyway
