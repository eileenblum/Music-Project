All Is under the attack of false
And I can't exist for a while
I'm pressed by vice to receive the fall
In order to degenerate my life.

Everything is in danger construction
The imperfect society is incorrigible
It's a main purpose, it's destruction.

The civilization is neglected by trash
But we have no way backward
This is the end in embraces of the God.
And he can't help us.
