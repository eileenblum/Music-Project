Everytime climbing here again and again
On this hill, warping by the dark woods
Everytime my road is more difficult and in vain
But this point is nearby and no wayback wards.

From this point you can see a real mirror
Of this abstract worlds
You'll recall the time, when you were in
The depression of soul
You'll recall the days, when you were a lucky man
You'll recall everything and your lucky days
But remembered - you must forget.

Well, I'm here now, I've come in order
To turn down all types of moan
To cross the line of renunciation
And I can see that omen.

On this hill it's the symbol of hope
Slow-witted and victory 
And standing here you can feel
That the grieve is run away...

And a light of hope is reigning
At the moment you have left this place
You can take the feeling...
How you've dissolved in the stream of life.
