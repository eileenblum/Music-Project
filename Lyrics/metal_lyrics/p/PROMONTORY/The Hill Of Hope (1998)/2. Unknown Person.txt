Suddenly I've seen the shadow
In the darkness on the wall
It's time for him and here he is...
But nobody can see his shrewd sight
The hopelessness has come and the fever
Has filled the world.

He try to say something...
And give the chance... In your fortune.

Unknown Person...
He comes suddenly...
You see him right along
He is in every secret 
Awake! And you'll see him.

It's difficult to change something
He'll define you choise
What will this figure carry itself?
Been as a shadow forever...

Unknown Person...
He comes suddenly...
You see him right along
He is in every secret 
Awake! And you'll see him.

But the lines disappear, the sunrise will begin
Going away, he didn't leave his steps
The sunshine has entered the window
Dissipating all the signs of Unknown Person...
