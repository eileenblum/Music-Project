Settings fire in the midnight dark
You try to recognize the contours of a way in dark
But there is already another time
To go at random and to disbelieve not why
Only you really exist.

But in yourself you are broken.
The all are passing it that miracle
And you ask yourself - I broken?
To go in a way you take with yourself
The faith, that you must go from all
To promise, that you'll be searched then 
That you never lose.

But there, you are standing on the crossroads
All decisive, what is in this for yourself
And above all, it is hypocrisy 
The lie, what gives dark for your mind
Or, leave with yourself
Come into the fight, and try an idea
What takes place in the other days
It's you - for everything being broken.
