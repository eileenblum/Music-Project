When it is so low that you cannot even see
A mythic fog has come to you.
Free your spirit and share it with the nature
And become a part of what created you.

Enjoy the silence listen it carefully
Listen to the world that is talking to you.
He wants you to be a part of what you were
And reject the limits and create your own
