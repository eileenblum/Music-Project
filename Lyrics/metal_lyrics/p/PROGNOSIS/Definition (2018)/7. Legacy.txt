Time
Ticks
Hear like leaves rustling in the evening breeze
The last grains of sand in the hourglass fall forever

Time
Slows
We your legacy your own flesh and blood will carry you onwards
As memories threaten tears we will turn them into smiles and remember
Your vibrant life doesn't end here

Time
Flows
See through shifting clouds from your throne of eternity
How we survive this tragedy with pride and power
You were a warrior a mother living without fear
Fighting every battle with sword and spear for us

Inevitability doesn't help the pain
And we will miss you everyday
But come sun snow sleet or rain
Your love and legacy remains
