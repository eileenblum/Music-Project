Silver plagues the sky
Before the setting sun
Nowhere left to hide
All you can do is run

Helpless children cry
Amidst their final breaths
Shifting sands of time
Bringing only death

Drones, set to kill

Crosshair dots their eyes
As the night draws near
Fortune waves goodbye
Leaving lonely fear

Watch your brand new fate
As you dissipate
Built, for blood and gore
The human touch has left this war
