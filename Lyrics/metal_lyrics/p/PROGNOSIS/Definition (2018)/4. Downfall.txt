To the one that looked aside
For cowardice and guilt
To the one that swore then lied
Time starts to wilt

To the one who fueled their hate
Where is your love?
To the one that sealed their fate
When push comes to shove

You've just got to stop
I've reached my breaking point
It's not that hard to see
What you've done to me
These scars will never fade
A debt that can't be paid
The damage caused by all
Will be your last downfall

To the one that had to laugh
Will you still smile
With your life's epitaph
Trapped in denial

To the one that had to hurt
To feel like a man
And left me in the dirt
You've got to understand
You've just got to stop
I've reached my breaking point
It's not that hard to see
What you've done to me
These scars will never fade
A debt that can't be paid
The damage caused by all
Will be your last downfall

To the ones that cried my name
I did not go in vain
So carry my message for all
The accused deserve everything they get
I'm so tired of the way humans and humans
Can't just get along
Sooner or later we'll be caught in a crossfire all over again
Is that what you want?

To the one that stands for good
Your efforts count
To the one that shouted loud
Your voice is heard

To the ones who rule the world
You can't take us all
To the ones that feed the change
You're not alone

You've just got to stop
I've reached my breaking point
It's not that hard to see
What you've done to me
These scars will never fade
A debt that can't be paid
The damage caused by all
Will be your last downfall
