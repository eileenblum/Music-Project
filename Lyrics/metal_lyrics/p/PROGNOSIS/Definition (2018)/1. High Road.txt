Take the high road
The easy way
Burn possessions
So you can't stay
Confess your actions
Hold on tight
Sacrifices
To prove you're right

They criticise, humiliate
They try to break you down
They point the blame, it resonates
Upon the burning ground

I'm on the edge, of losing control
Clutching my spade I'm always digging a hole
It's just this thing that I do, that I do to you
So throw me a rope and help me get out of my hole
Help me, help me

From out of darkness
With eyes wide shut
You feel your anger
Building up
Your only solace
Remains the same
Mistrusted abstract
Spell out your name

They criticise, humiliate
They try to break you down
They point the blame, it resonates
Upon the burning ground

I'm on the edge, of losing control
Clutching my spade I'm always digging a hole
It's just this thing that I do, that I do to you
So throw me a rope and help me get out of my hole
Help me, help me

Oh you're bewitched, hypnotised
Under their spell
Now feast your eyes, mesmerised
Give them hell
