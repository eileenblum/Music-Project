Negativity is leaching
Sucking all that it tastes
A life lived in conflict
Such a shameful waste

Paranoia is burning
Through narrow blue eyes
Trapped within your prison
Of ignorant disguise

Time won't wait for you
It never rests
So bury your discontent
And all of your mistakes
You must forgive and forget
'Cause in the end
It's you who's left behind

If there's a god it watches
Contorted and confused
Made us in its image
Then watched a beast evolve

Time won't wait for you
It never rests
So bury your discontent
And all of your mistakes
You must forgive and forget
'Cause in the end
It's you who's left behind

You and I will end up in the grave
