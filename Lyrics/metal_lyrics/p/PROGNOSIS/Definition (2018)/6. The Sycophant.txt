Teardrops stain catatonic prayers
Pleading mercy and new found faith
You play the part of the tragic victim
And seek remorse in death's embrace

He sheds his skin now
Nothing more than flesh and bone
No goodness rests here
Just the scars of sticks and stones

You inhaled the pneumatic lies
Fell in line with his caustic games
Unmasked reality now laughs at you
Sin soaks the skeletal remains
He sheds his skin now
Nothing more than flesh and bone
No goodness rests here
Just the scars of sticks and stones

Hiding from the tempest behind fake regret
I got scared in my final breath
Thief of another's faith that's not who I am
Take a look 'cause there's blood on my hands
