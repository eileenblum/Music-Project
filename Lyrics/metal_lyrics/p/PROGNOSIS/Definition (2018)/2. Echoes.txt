Your life's intoxicating
You find it hard to breathe
For everything you've given
You still wait to receive

Your body's shaking

Echoes remind you of the pain
Deep rooted in your brain
Alienated cast aside
In the shadows of your shame

Someone is calling you
Someone is haunting you

You make a new beginning
Yet sleepless prevail
Hallucinations shroud your sight
Slowly your mind derails

The bleakness takes you

Time slips by unnoticed
Eternity draws near
Fountain of youth eroded
There are no answers here

Warning signs
Shiver down your spine
Warning signs
That you can't hide

Peace reigns within you
Where lightning strikes twice
Illusions that you knew
Must be cast aside
