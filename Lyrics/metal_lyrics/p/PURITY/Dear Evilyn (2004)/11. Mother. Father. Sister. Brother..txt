Oh dear mother.
Maybe I have gone too far.
Maybe I have done some harm.
But I never meant to hurt you.
Father. you triced me up.
You have kept me outta streets.
I am getting back on my feet.
Even failures are still haunting me.

Right now they make me.
It's the better me who's running forward
Somehow they envy me.
And suddenly I gotta fight my way out.

Sister my only one
You have fought against that sore
You've never asked troubles more
Still sometimes they didn't seem to understand
Brother. the little one.
You have always count on me.
But I haven't always count on you.
Please mother. father. sister. brother.

Right now they make me.
It's the better me who's running forward
Somehow they envy me.
And suddenly I gotta fight my way out.
