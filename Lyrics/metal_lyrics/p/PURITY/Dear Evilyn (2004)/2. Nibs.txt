Would you settle down? you turgid man.
Revert to circle. don't hide from me.
Would you close the door? you trembling man.
A breeze is tracing figures in the shadows
But you don't see...

I bow my head when you raise your hands
Why are you reaching the stars?
You're like the infant son of a naive man
How have you come this far?

They gave you promise to rule your land.
For feat. for glory. for something you can only dream.
Just like "the others" before you.
Deny truth. revile truth. who are you?
You still don't see...

I bow my head when you raise your hands
Why are you reaching the stars?
You're like the infant son of a naive man
How have you come this far?
