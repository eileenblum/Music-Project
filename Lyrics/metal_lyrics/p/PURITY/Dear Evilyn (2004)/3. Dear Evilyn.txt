Seemingly unwilling - but thoughtful man
Who wants to stay by his side.
Bring me to life. bring me to life. bring me to life.

Won't you take me to the place where we have been?
Searching for the answer. what should the answer be?
Aim is for truth. or was it just a lie.
By the hammer of justice all beautiful dies.

Seemingly unwilling - but thoughtful man
Who wants to stay by his side.
Bring me to life. bring me to life. bring me to life.

Why do you tempt me?
Would you hide your smile?
Why do you avoid me?
Am I taking too much time?

Please, take me back to the place where we have been?
To a source for the answers. and my answer will be?
I'll give you my all as I think it should be.
But you pulled me down, down - dear Evilyn.

Seemingly unwilling - but thoughtful man
Who wants to stay by his side.
Bring me to life. bring me to life. bring me to life.

Why do you tempt me?
Would you hide your smile?
Why do you avoid me?
Am I taking too much time?
