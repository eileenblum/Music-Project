Prevent a cold out of loneliness. so pale, so feeble.
From here to a day of reckoning.
Where is a phrase of empathy? when is the sense fragile?
When aiming at the good but the truth is blistering.

I'm feeling guilty after grief
I stand alone with a thousand questions.
I'm feeling shame, it's all I need?
Fall into deep. into deep.
I'm feeling guilty after grief

Judge me if I erase the memories, those scribbled pictures
Shapeless. colors fleet to black and white.
Freedom seems to bring us both to life
Deaf. pierced and blind. all I have is just an empty core.

I'm feeling guilty after grief
I stand alone with a thousand questions.
I'm feeling shame, it's all I need?
Fall into deep. into deep.
I'm feeling guilty after grief
