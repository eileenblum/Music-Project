When you said to me
'are you with me just for reason?'
I can't believe what you said to me
Have to think about the meaning
There ain't borders to be broken
Just the promise to live for
There's no books to be burned now
Just you - only you

Standing
Here side by side
When we are together
I hold you I cradle my love
Waiting
Together side by side
And I love you
I love you I devote myself to

Small words are strong
May hurt you or can heal you
Listen. learn. and talk to me
Only living lecture of life
To me you're tomorrow
The future and a dream
There's one mistake to be fixed now
I'll do it for you
