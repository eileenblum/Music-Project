It feels like running
Don't take this pulse away from me
Taste of odor - pulse of strength
I keep this emotion inside
The rest of all will be forgotten

How so far
You have come to me (you have come to me)
We've been so far enemies
So why did you come to me
We have been hiding just for nothing

A dream is waiting
We've been standing
On the edge of grounded soil

Suddenly I am nothing
You are neither
Burn this cape for you
Suddenly I am nothing
You are neither
Ever felt like me?

A dream is waiting
We've been standing
On the edge of grounded soil
