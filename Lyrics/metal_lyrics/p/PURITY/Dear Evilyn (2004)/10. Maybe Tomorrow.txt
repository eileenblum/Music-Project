I am living in the middle of a speech of uncertainty
I'm surrounded by the words which I don't know - what do you mean?

Why are you tired of me?
I'm looking for the path to follow.
Am I waiting for something or nothing?
A hope - maybe tomorrow.

I am living in the middle of a speech of uncertainty
I'm surrounded by the words which I don't know - what do you mean?

Why are you tired of me?
I'm looking for the path to follow.
Am I waiting for something or nothing?
A hope - maybe tomorrow.

I'm in a darkness of darkness.
I can't find the path to follow.
I'm in a darkness of darkness.
I'm living in the world of horror.
