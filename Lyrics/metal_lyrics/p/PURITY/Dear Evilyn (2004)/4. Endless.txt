I'm out of you. you are out of me.
Payback time. no more pride.
I'm drying out or soaking in.
It's leaving me. touch of empty

All is just the same to me
It doesn't feel like first time
Like a gentle touch on my skin

Soul is hollow. open scene
When all of the stories are yesterday
I'm running slow and air is thin
Touch of empty is leaving me

All is just the same to me
It doesn't feel like first time
Like a gentle touch on my skin
All feels different to me
It feels like the last time
Like a carved scar on my skin
