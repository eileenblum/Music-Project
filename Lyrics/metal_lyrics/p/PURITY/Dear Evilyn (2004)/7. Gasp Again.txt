Since when have we felt like strangers?
I push you in. you pull me under.
Since when it has taken us down?
One time? for the reason?

Hey! have you ever felt like me.
You almost never give me anything.

All this hate you gave me.
All this love I cannot feel any longer

Wake! I'll ring for freedom today.
Right! I'll fight for freedom to stay.
I have to pay. to never gasp again.

Give me. stay here. save me.
How can you break me when I bleed for you
You cannot push us down
I show you how

Wake! I'll ring for freedom today.
Right! I'll fight for freedom to stay.
I have to pay. to never gasp again.
We have to pay. to never gasp again.
