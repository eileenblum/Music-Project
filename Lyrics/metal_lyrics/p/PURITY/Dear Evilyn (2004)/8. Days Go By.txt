More! am I full of you?
What are we seeking? what is left for?
More! if I'm your only son?
Am I a murderer - time to go on

Foul! I am full of you!
What am I waiting? why am I in here?
Grouse! it's my reality.
I'll keep on losing if I stay here

Talk. all I'm asking for is peace
I didn't know this shit was going to be real
I just try to hang on to the future

I won't take. I won't take this no more.
I won't take. I won't take this no more.

Raise! I'll raise my arms for you
I'll hope it's over. I'm regarding.
Peace! it is what I'm looking for.
Days go by - time to go on

Talk. all I'm asking for is peace
I didn't know this shit was going to be real
I just try to hang on to the future
