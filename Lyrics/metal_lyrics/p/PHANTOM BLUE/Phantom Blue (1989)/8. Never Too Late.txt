Been such a long time we've gone separate ways
I can't believe I ever let you go
I gave my heart I gave you my soul
It felt so good to me
What we had was so unreal
Chained in a fantasy

Now that you're gone
The walls are closing in
Still I'm alone
'Cause I gotta be sure

[Chorus]
It's never too late to start it over
I remember what we had and I want it all back again
Never too late to start it over
It's never too late to start it over.

I see you, can feel you standing by my side
Emotions between us tear me up inside
You took my heart, you took my soul
Left me standing in the rain
But what I feel I can't control
Is driving me insane

Now that you're gone
The walls are closing in
Still I'm alone
'Cause I gotta be sure

You can take a piece of my heart
You can take anything you want
You can get as close as you want
I'll give you anything you need
