Don't know where I've been
Or what I had to gain
Sometimes I wonder
Was I to blame?

Four walls surround me
In a world that seems so cold
Still I keep trying
To get my story told

I can't wait no longer
It's time I move along
I've waited so long
Why keep hanging on?

[Chorus]
I'm walking away
Looking back at you
Got nothing to say
As I walk away from you again
It wasn't easy
I'm walking away
And I'd do it all again

I can't explain all you put me through
And I'm not afraid of living without you
If it means the end that's what I'll have to do
I can't pretend 'til the lies come true

I can't wait no longer
It's time I move along
I've waited so long
Why keep hanging on?
