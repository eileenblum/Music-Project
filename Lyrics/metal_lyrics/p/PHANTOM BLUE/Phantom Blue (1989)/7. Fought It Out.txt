Ran out of reasons
It's breaking me down
I can't figure out
These things I'm feeling
Is this what it's all about?
I was believing the things that you said
You had me going
This is the real world
Gotta keep my feet on the ground
On the ground

[Chorus]
Fought it out with you
Out to the end, with nothing to gain
And now we're through
Fought it out, fought it out with you

I can't keep thinking of these mistakes
Now it's too late
Sometimes it hits me
And it's hard to face
Hard to face
