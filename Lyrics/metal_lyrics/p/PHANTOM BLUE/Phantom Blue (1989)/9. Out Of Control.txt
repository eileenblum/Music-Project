Out in the distance
Outside my door
Seems like the world is burning
Out of control, don't cha know
First they try to teach me
To play their games
If I live by their rules I know I'd
Surely go insane
This world's to blame

So we've got to find a way
Look deep in our minds
How can the world go on
Blind leading blind?

[Chorus]
Out of control
This can't go on these games we're playing
Out of control
What can be done?
This world is out of control

Systems failing
Breaking down in time
Looks like we're really not such
Clever minds, no not my kind
Feel it coming deep in the night
The life I'm living could fill me
Fill me with fright
