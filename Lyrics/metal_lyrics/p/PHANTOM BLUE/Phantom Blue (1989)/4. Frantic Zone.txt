Skylight's dim, Sonics freight
Uncontrollable misfit, contractible fate
The seduction began, realized too late
Easy to see there's no escape

A regression of time, an intrinsic state
Been sabotaged with too many weights
A solid  approach to the tailored plans
To hold on to the ultimate game

[Chorus]
In the frantic zone
Taken hostage by insanity
In the frantic zone
Intangible security

Look around
It's not so hard to believe
Hear the sounds
The answer is so hard to see

The showage of senseless attitudes
The masterminds all break the rules
The seduction began, realized too late
Easy to see there's no escape
