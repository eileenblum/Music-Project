This danger zone
You get off on playing Russian Roulette
Your life's so full of four lettered words
Once you get started you don't give in

How much longer now
Will you hang around
How much longer now
You've got to

[Chorus]
Slow it down
You're burning out the fire
Running out of wasted time
Slow it down
You're shorting out the wire
Soon you'll find you're one step over the line

You can't control such an overload
You're always searching can't find your soul
The stories on how to know me more
Once we're together again and again
