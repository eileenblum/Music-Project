Giving all and more is what we thought was right
What a big mistake it was when we all stepped aside
All the things you've put aside to please your mind
Is making us, just makes us so sad we wanna cry
wanna cry

[Chorus]
Where will you go now?
Can you let it all go?

We all know that you're hurting, cuz we all feel the pain
But when we dig for reasons all the answers are the same
There's gonna be a day that you will realize it's all inside
It's all inside of your mind
in your mind

[Chorus]
Where will you go now?
Can you let it all go now?
What are you gonna do now?
When nothing seems to beat your mind..

We've tried to revive you, we did
We all are beside you, we are
We've tried to be with you, we tried
We all are inside you, inside
We've tried to uplift you, you know that!
We've tried to, we've tried to

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Where will you go now?
Can you let it all go?
What are you gonna do now?
When nothing seems to beat your mind.

[Repeat chorus + out]
