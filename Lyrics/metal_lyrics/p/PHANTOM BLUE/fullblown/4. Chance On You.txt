I don't wanna wait
Cause you're tearing me in two
Never knowing what to do

Oh, I don't wanna get away from you

Oh, I wanna take
A chance that you'll be through
With the one that's close to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I wanna stay
Don't wanna wait
I know I'm wasting time
But it's too late

[Chorus]
Cause I don't wanna walk away from you
I wanna take my chance on you

I wanna say
That you change your mind
But life's not that kind

Oh, I have got to stay away from you

[Pre-Chorus]

Oh I feel betrayed
You're not that great
I've wasted all my time
Now it's too late

[Chorus x2]
Cause I don't wanna walk away from you
I wanna take my chance on you

[Solo]

[Chorus x2 + out]
