Every time I see you boy, my little buttercup
I want to eat a part of you, Your taste is what I love
You're nothing like a Snicker's bar, you're more an Oreo
Hard and crunchy on the top and sweet from down below

Oh, my cookie
Oh, my cookie boy!

Can I lay my cookies on your sack?

You're nothing like a Pay-Day bar
You are more like a Twix
I want to take a bite of you and cover you with licks
Your sweet and sexy caramel is driving me insane
I want to rub my fingers through your marshmallowy mane

Oh my cookie
Oh my cookie boy!

Can I lay my cookies on your sack?  [x2]

[BREAK]

Oh my cookie
Oh my cookie boy!

Can I lay my cookies on your sack?
Want to lick the fudge right off your back
Can I lay my cookies on your sack
Baby, you're so sweet you make me crack!
