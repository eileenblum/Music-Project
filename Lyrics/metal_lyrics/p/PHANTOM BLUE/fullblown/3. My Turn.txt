It's times like these that make you feel so crazy
Look at what you thought you had
Over and over you just can't seem to face it
The things you love can make you mad.

[Bridge]
Endless stories go on and on
Never coming to an end
Round and round they have no meaning
So why pretend?

[Chorus]
It's my turn, to turn you inside out
It's my turn, to make you feel the pain
It's my turn, to give you what you ask for
It's my turn, to make you feel some shame.

I think of things, the things you used to do
I wonder what I was to you
Deceit and lies made you feel like a man
Blackened love is hate's command

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Times like these can make you very crazy
Look at what you thought you had

[Chorus x2]
