Where do the bad ones go?
His eyes tell the story
Picked up for beating up on
Little old ladies

Animated warfare
Blown up in my mind
Could you darken the color
So black won't look so white?

Feel the defeat yeah
The man lost his money
Send me to sleep from now on
Three hours early

[Chorus]
Mutha won't you dry my eyes
It's scaring me it's scaring me
Mutha say it's only lies
It's killing me
Oh mutha please

Mr. Yami Schwami
He  lied to take a life
I want my mommy wommy
To put me out of sight
It's bad enough I got the rain
The wind and thunder too
One sober day's all I want
From the damn evening news

[Chorus]
