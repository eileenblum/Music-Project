Don't care at all what's being said
I know it's over I've been so bad
No more sitting in your space
I've walked all over there's no room left

[Chorus]
Strike me down
I won't hear you coming
Don't turn around
Just keep on running
Strike me down
I have nothing left to say
Don't turn around
just go on and strike me down

Guess I shoulda known you wouldn't take much more
You gave me what I wanted and I kicked you in the face
I'm on my knees
Revenge is sweet and so it seems
You've got the sands of time on your side
I'm just sitting without a place to hide
