I'd rather die than to give it to you
I'd rather die than to be true
I'd rather die than to be in the likes of you

I'd rather die than to give you my soul
I'd rather die than to give you control
I'd rather die than to be in the likes of you
in the likes of you
Love is so divine
but not in the likes of

I'd rather die than to swap your spit
I'd rather die than to take your shit
I'd rather die than to be in the fucking likes of you
In the likes of you

[Chorus]
Love is so divine
but not in the likes of you
Love is so divine
but not in the likes of you
Fuck you
Fuck you
