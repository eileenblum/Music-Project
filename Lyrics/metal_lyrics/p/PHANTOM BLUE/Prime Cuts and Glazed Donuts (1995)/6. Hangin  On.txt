I've traveled down this road and it seemed to me
I've been hiding for too long set me free
Like a story being told to me
One look in your eyes and I knew it would have to be

[Pre chorus]
Now we must go our own ways
Time will tell the price we pay
Flame runs on into the night
Without you I'll lose my mind

[Chorus]
And when the fire's gone
Will we keep hangin on?
Or will we just let go?
Will we keep hangin on?

Took me there to that sacred place
Child-like smile filled that empty space
How I pray we never drift apart
Cause I'll always hold you close in my heart

[Pre chorus]

[Chorus]
