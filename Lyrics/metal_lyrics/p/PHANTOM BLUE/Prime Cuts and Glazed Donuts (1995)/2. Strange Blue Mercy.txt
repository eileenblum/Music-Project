Well I was slowly walking up the ladder so high
Tried to look down
there was  no ground
I started talking to the people in the sky
Every word was heard but nothing was said
It was a one man ride

I was not trying
hard to sell my soul yet
Man in the mirror faded more and more
Started crying to the people in the sky
Your own big brother's paying to fly
It was sixty-nine

[Chorus I]
Strange blue mercy
Set the Autumn leaves on fire
Strange blue mercy

Won't get the sun without the rain
Inside dreams hide the key to the pain
Escape from fears gone far from the past
It's only all in my head

[Chorus II]
Strange blue mercy
Set the Autumn leaves on fire
Strange blue mercy
I don't wanna feel it

[Chorus III]
Strange blue mercy
Set the Autumn leaves on fire
Strange blue mercy
I don't wanna feel it
Strange blue mercy
Set the Autumn leaves on fire
Strange blue mercy
Inside the weird gold mine
