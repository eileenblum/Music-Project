Goin' home late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Oh I looked through a window
surprised what I saw
Fairies in boots were dancing with the dwarves
all right now

Oh, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it I saw it, I tell you no lies
Well fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
all right now
Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it, I tell you no lies
Well fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
All right now

So I went to the doctor
see what he could give me
He said "Girl, girl you've gone too far
Cause smokin and trippin is all that you do".
Yeah.
