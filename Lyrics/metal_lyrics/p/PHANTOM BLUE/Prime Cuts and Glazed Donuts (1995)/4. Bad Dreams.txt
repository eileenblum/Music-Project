You walked on the scene of a street in a dream
You took my hand
Led me to the far away place
and left me a dead man

Now I see your face every time I scream
Picture fades I don't  have to seem
So blind that I would take you on
It's all right just one night
you'll soon belong to me, no

[Chorus]
Bad dreams aren't forever
Can't hold on to them
Bad dreams aren't forever no
One in a million fall down from the sky
Bad dreams aren't forever

You told me a long time ago, you said
Don't look in my eyes with your anger
Just turn your back and walk away
from the man who swears he's your best friend
Next thing you know he's under your bed

[Chorus]

They just die
Bad dreams, bad dreams, bad dreams
