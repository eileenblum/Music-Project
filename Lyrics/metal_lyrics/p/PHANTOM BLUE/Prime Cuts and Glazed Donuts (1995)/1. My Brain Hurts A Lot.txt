It starts much too early
Never get there on time
They say that I'm lazy
I'm just not the kind
No no no no no no,
Never thought it'd be this way
My mind is aching
I'm sinking low

[Chorus]
My brain hurts a lot
Don't know where to stop
No  no
My brain it hurts a lot
Pushed it to overload

They say when you grow up
It's not no paradise
This ain't no fucking heaven
and Heaven's on my mind
All I hear
is screaming sirens everywhere
Oh sweet baby
can you take me there?
