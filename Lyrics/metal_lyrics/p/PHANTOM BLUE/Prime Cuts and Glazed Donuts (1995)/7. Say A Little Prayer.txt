No one would take him
Gave him time to think it all out
Thirty counts of mayhem
His best defense was to make no sense at all
Take him down one by one
Fake it on the stand
Feed them all the full blown lies
Gotta free this desperate man

[Chorus I]
No one loves you
No one cares
Go to sleep and
say your little prayers

Accusations get in the way
Careless told what he might do
Wished his shadow wouldn't get in the way
Behind bars outside it is cold

[Chorus II]
No one needs you
No despair
What's done is done
Now lie down in your bed
No one loves you
No one cares
Go to sleep
Now say your little prayers
