Time is running faster
It's out of our hands
No point in looking back
Don't care where we're going
Can't stick around to see anything else
Despite confusion we haven't got a chance

Running to nowhere
told not to go there

[Chorus]
We're going mad
We're going mad
We're going mad can't you see
Don't try to stop this
Just let it be

Can't overlook this one
What's to be said
Why all these shadows hanging around
No it's not easy to comprehend
Been kicked too many times
the world's upside down

Running to nowhere
Told not to go there
