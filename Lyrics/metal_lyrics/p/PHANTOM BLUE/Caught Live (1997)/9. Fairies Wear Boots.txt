[Black Sabbath Cover]

Goin' home late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Oh I looked through a window
Surprised what I saw
Fairies in boots were dancing with the dwarves
Allright now

Oh, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it I saw it, I tell you no lies
Well fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
Allright now

Yeah fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it, I tell you no lies
Well fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes
Allright now

So I went to the doctor
See what he could give me
He said "Girl, girl you've gone too far
Cause smokin and trippin is all that you do".
Yeah.
