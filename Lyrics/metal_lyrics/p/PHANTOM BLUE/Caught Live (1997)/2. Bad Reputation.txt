[originally by Thin Lizzy]

You've got a bad reputation
That's the word out on the town
It gives a certain fascination
But it can only bring you down

[Chorus]
Turn yourself around
Turn yourself around
Turn it upside down
Turn yourself around

You got bad breaks
Well, that's tough luck
You've played too hard
Too much rough stuff
You're too sly, so cold
That bad reputation has made you old
