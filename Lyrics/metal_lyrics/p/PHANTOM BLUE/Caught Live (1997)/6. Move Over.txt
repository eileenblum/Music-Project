[originally by Janis Joplin]

You say that it's over baby
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around
Well come on now
Won't you move over

You know that I need a man
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
that maybe you can

Please don't you do it to me babe
Please don't you do it to me babe
Either take the love I offer
or just let me be

I ain't quite ready for walkin'
I ain't quite ready for walkin'
Just walk on through my life
Lord just dangling

Make up your mind honey
You're playing with me
I said now make up your mind darlin'
You're playing with me
I said now, now either be my lovin man
I said let me honey, let me be, yeah

[Repeat verses 1 thru 3]

I said won't you, won't you let me be
Honey you're teasing me
Yeah, you're playing with my heart, yeah
I believe you're toying with my affections honey
I can't take it no more babe
And furthermore, I don't intend to
Just how do you think you got my love
on the end of a string honey
You expect me to follow you
like a goddamn mule
I can't take it no more babe.
