Excuse me,
Yeah, I know what you're thinking
Tried to buy me then you denied me
twist my mind but that's okay
Excuse me,
Yeah, I know what you're running from
You can hide it then lie about it
Go to hell and I won't mind
Where is my tomorrow?
This is my tomorrow

[Chorus]
Cut down the middle
I'm bleeding from nowhere
I'm bleeding from nowhere
I'm bleeding from nowhere

Excuse me
Yeah, I know where you're going
Hell's gonna find you sneak up behind you
turn the tables 'round this time

Excuse me
Yeah, what the fuck you lying for?
Speak your mind but don't waste my time
Go to hell and I won't mind
Where is my tomorrow?
This is my tomorrow.
