Mad mad man in a bottle
Sad sad  man sad man oh man what the hell's wrong
So many different sights a little south of the border
Solo flight through a guiltless mind
A little dirt on the doormat of life
Falling down the stairs reaching out for a hand
Got no fingers on it and a watch that tells no time

[Chorus]
I like a little evil
Sometimes it makes me feel
I like a little evil
Oh yeah

It's not a fool's gold that holds the taste of fine wine
It smells sweeter to me born right out of the blue
Took the seed from the garden of truth
Looking through a crystal eye in the sky
See them runnin round in circles like they've lost their minds
