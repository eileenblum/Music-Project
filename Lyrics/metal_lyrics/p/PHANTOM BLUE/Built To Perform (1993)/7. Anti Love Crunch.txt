Checkin' you out you be looking so fine
Call me dessert babe if you wanna grind
Got my new freedom but it ain't no freedom to me
Wanna do it but you're just not gonna listen
And it doesn't really matter
Cause we won't do more than kissin'
Oh, it's not up to me anti love

[Chorus]
Anti love crunch
Anti love
Anti love crunch

Been whining and pleading and begging to score
The color is red baby need I say more?
Got my wings on but we ain't gonna fly tonight
Say you want me and you want more than the kissin'
But it doesn't really matter
Cause I gotta keep you wishin'
Oh, it's not up to me anti love
