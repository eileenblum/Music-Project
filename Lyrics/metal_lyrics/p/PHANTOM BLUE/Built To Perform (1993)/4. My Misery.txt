God only knows
That sometimes
It's hard to even fake a smile
It gets so old looking at these
City Lights
So dark and lonely but I'll be alright
I'm praying

[Chorus]
My misery
Bring it down come and take it from me
My misery
Love is careless in just who it might see
My misery

So far away
Closer than those
Who are surrounding me
Something's reaching something unseen
Keeps coming over me and
Calling my name

[Repeat chorus x3]
