Mean cat tried to bring me down
I said hey man, won't cha lose my number
He is  way off track
I got eyes in my back baby

Take off this ball and chain
It's as heavy as a brick house
I said stay away
Get out of my neighborhood
Blew me way off track
I got a knife in my back

[Chorus]
Nothing good comes easy baby
Nothing good, nothing good
Wash my hands of this I'm lazy
'Cause baby nothing good
