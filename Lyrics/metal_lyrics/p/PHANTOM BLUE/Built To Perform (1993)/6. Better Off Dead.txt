I know you swim in the shit from your own fat head
Feel not a thing
Numb to your brother who lies in the street
I'll show you a million words that I never said

[Chorus I]
Now it's time to reap in what you've sown
Better off dead
Nail me down
My soul you'll never own
Better off dead

I claim you a symbol for what's wrong today
Closed eyes with my back to you
Shattered faith of your jaded prey

[Chorus II]
Now it's time to reap in what you've sown
Better off dead
Nail me down
My soul you'll never own
Better off dead
Smear your face in dirt from which you were born
Better off dead
Losing now a mask of false control
Better off dead
