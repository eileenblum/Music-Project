Why do they say it makes the world go 'round?
From what I've seen it just goes up and down
What in the world could make you feel so sad?
I'm letting go of what I never had

I can't believe
Sometimes it's hard to see
I fell for you and now it brings me to my knees

[Chorus]
Why call it love?
I call it pain
Why call it love?
Can't you see what it's done to me?
Love, love
Why call it love?
When hearts can turn to stone

Why do they say it would last so long?
From what I've seen it's here and then it's gone
It's a fine line between love and pain
So much to lose and yet so much to gain

I can't believe
Sometimes it's hard to see
I fell for you and now it brings me to my knees

[Chorus]
