My hands are trembling, cold sweat comes out
And all perception's caught up in this real nightmare
I see them razing all to ground
We try to hide or run away
And through my eyes I see our dreams - fading away

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The end is near, blood rain will fall
Rivers of blood, will drown all live
And in the end, nothing remains

The sky is darkening, blood everywhere
The smell of black despair and death lies in the air
I hear the cries of fighting men
Defending home and families
And I run until I fall - till I fall

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The end is near, blood rain will fall
Rivers of blood, will drown all live
And in the end, nothing remains

The world is cruel and full of hate
Greed rules the world, what worth has life?
Careless and cold, tortured to death
Just for a small handful of coins

Blood rain - What worth has life?

Blood rain's falling
Blood rain's falling
Blood rain is falling down

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The end is near, blood rain will fall
Rivers of blood, will drown all live
And in the end, nothing remains
