Open your eyes and don't look away
See all the scars that we have caused
Innocence, ignorance and lies
This will be our final legacy

Listen to the cries of Mother Nature
Creeping to death - there's no return
Innocence, ignorance and lies
This will be our final legacy

This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death
This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death (this will be, our legacy)

Globalization's out of control
Darkened and grey, we're losing all hope
Innocence, ignorance and lies
This will be our final legacy

Life in abundance on natures' cost
We're creeping to death - there's no return

This will be, this will be our legacy
This (this), will (will), be our legacy

Innocence, ignorance and lies
This will be our final legacy

This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death
This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death (this will be, our legacy)

We're left in pollution and emptiness
Greed for profit - future is lost
Is this the last step of evolution? - our legacy

This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death
This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death

Innocence, ignorance and lies
This will be our final legacy

This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death
This is the system, there's no way out
You're caught in spiral of death (this will be, our legacy)

Creeping into innocence, fading to grey
Brainwashed humanity, this will be our legacy

Legacy, legacy
