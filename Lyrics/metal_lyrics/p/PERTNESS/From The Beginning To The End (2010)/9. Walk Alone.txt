Walk alone in the dark
I'm so lonely in this world
Fear and hate in my head
Destroying the dreams of a better life (murderer)

Creatures, creatures, creatures without any face

Fight against all the lies
Fear to lose my last disguise
Try to hide my worthless life
There will be no escape (murderer)

Come and see, how they kill, in the dark
Creatures, creatures, creatures, without any face

Crime and terror day and might
I'm so tired of this fight
No return back to life
Faceless creatures want my death (murderer)

Come and see, how they kill, in the dark
Creatures, creatures, creatures, without any face
Walk, walk, walk alone, walk, walk, walk alone
Walk, walk, alone

Walk alone in the dark
I'm so lonely in this world
Walk alone in the dark
I'm so lonely in this world

See, how they kill, in the dark
Creatures, creatures, creatures, without any face

Walk alone in the dark
I'm so lonely in this world
Fear and hate in my head
Destroying the dreams of a better life (murderer)
