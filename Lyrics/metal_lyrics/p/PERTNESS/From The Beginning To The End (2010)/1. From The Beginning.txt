Twilight whispers and thousand lies
Time runs fast, where do we go?
Can't remember - my memories fade
No time to rest, the future's now

See the wonder, feel the fire
Life has come, life has gone
From the beginning, to the end
Time is out, we're on the run

Time will give us no second chance
I don't know where mankind ends
Always running we never cease
I'm scared of how tome passes by

See the wonder, feel the fire
Life has come, life has gone
From the beginning, to the end
Time is out, we're on the run

There will be no escape
There is no way to hide
There will be, there will be no escape
There will be no escape
There is no way to hide
There will be, there will be no escape

There is no way to hide
There will be no escape

See the wonder, feel the fire
Life has come, life has gone
From the beginning, to the end
Time is out, we're on the run

See the wonder, feel the fire
Life has come, life has gone
From the beginning, to the end
Time is out, we're on the run
