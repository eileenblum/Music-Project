I'm the master, the only one
I'm the voice in your mind
My words are burned into your soul - in your soul

Disillusion's rising, slave to the media
Falling into darkness, this all will be my prophecy
Disillusion's rising, slave to the media
Falling into darkness, this all will be my prophecy

My prophecy, my prophecy

I'm the master of everything
You're enslaved - forever
I'm the soul that feeds you will - feeds your will

Disillusion's rising, slave to the media
Falling into darkness, this all will be my prophecy
Disillusion's rising, slave to the media
Falling into darkness, this all will be my prophecy

My prophecy, my prophecy

Disillusion's rising, slave to the media
Falling into darkness, this all will be my prophecy
Disillusion's rising, slave to the media
Falling into darkness, this all will be my prophecy

My prophecy, my prophecy
My prophecy, my prophecy
My prophecy
