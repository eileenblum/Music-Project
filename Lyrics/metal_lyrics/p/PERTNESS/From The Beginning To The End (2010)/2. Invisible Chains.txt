Invisible chains keep holding me down
Fury and hate, I'm frozen to stone
They trapped all my senses soon I will be done
Betrayed and exploited, no will to live on

I'm alive, but I don't breathe
My feelings are dead, so dead
Confusion, aberration
Inside my mind, my mind

I see the world fading away
Into this fire light up by my mind
Lost my mind, nails in my brain
Inside my head, nothing left no more

They tortured my will
They raped all my feelings
They promised freedom
What I get is hell

Into my brain, they look and place things
There' no way out, insanity reigns
Trapped in the darkness of an endless night
Voices of horror, are piercing my mind

I'm alive, but I don't breathe
My feelings are dead, so dead
Confusion, aberration
Inside my mind, my mind
I see the world fading away

Into this fire light up by my mind
Lost my mind, nails in my brain
Inside my head, nothing left no more

I'm alive, but I don't breathe
My feelings are dead, so dead
Confusion, aberration
Inside my mind, my mind

I'm alive, but I don't breathe
My feelings are dead, so dead
Confusion, aberration
Inside my mind, my mind

Invisible chains keep holding me down
Fury and hate, I'm frozen, frozen to stone
