Millions are pinched from hunger
Don't you hear the children crying?
Disease and untold sorrow
The countdown runs, there's no way out

All you see is money
And your life in luxury

They all walk on the red carpet
Their intention is to save their own world
Piles of food and gallons of champagne
Six-course dinner while children starve to death

Remember their faces, remember their faces
Remember their faces - no dreams anymore
Remember their faces - empty and hopeless
Remember their faces - sadness and pain
Remember their faces - full of starvation

Bio fuel production rises
Meanwhile people crave for water
Don't you see all this misplanning?
Seed that never thrives - condemned to fail

All we hear are lies
And a lot of pointless promises

They all walk on the red carpet
Their intention is to save their own world
Piles of food and gallons of champagne
Six-course dinner while children starve to death

Remember their faces, remember their faces
Remember their faces - no dreams anymore
Remember their faces - empty and hopeless
Remember their faces - sadness and pain
Remember their faces - full of starvation

Remember their faces, remember their faces
Remember their faces - no dreams anymore
Remember their faces - empty and hopeless
Remember their faces - sadness and pain
Remember their faces - full of starvation
