In the name of god they reign, make you follow blind
Fight the evil, fight the world, bloody games they play

Of your mind and of your soul
They will take control
Once for all time you are lost
Forever you'll be slaved

God will bless the only land, as long as you obey
The land of freedom you will find
Protected by your god

Hand in hand you're falling deep
Follow blind into decline
Hand in hand you're falling deep
Follow blind into decline

Infected by the virus, named G.B.A.
You're looking into the face of death
But you do not realize
Brainwashed by the government, you try to carry on
To believe in fantasies created for control

In the name of god they reign, at least they tell to you
Double crossed so many times, reality's so far

Of your mind and of your soul
They will take control
Once for all time you are lost
Forever you'll be slaved

Devotional feelings block your mind
You never will be free
In the end we all will fall, fall into decline

Of your mind and of your soul
They will take control
Once for all time you are lost
Forever you'll be slaved

Hand in hand you're falling deep
Follow blind into decline
Hand in hand you're falling deep
Follow blind into decline

Hand in hand you're falling deep
Follow blind into decline
Hand in hand you're falling deep
Follow blind into decline
