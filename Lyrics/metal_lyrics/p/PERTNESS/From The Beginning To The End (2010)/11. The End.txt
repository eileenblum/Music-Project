Terrified by horror visions, hammered into your brains
The last judgment will come soon, is this the end?
Evil machination, are pulling all the strings
Pushing us into darkness, is this the end?
The good will rot in hell
Propaganda everywhere, is this the end?

Darkness and shadows are covering the sky
We're drifting towards the end
Rivers of poison will wash us away
We're drifting towards the end
Drifting towards the end

They give us answers full of lies
They promise eternal life
Deliverance from all the bad, is this the end?
Divine salvation and miracles, hypnotize our will
Panic mongering everywhere, is this the end?

Darkness and shadows are covering the sky
We're drifting towards the end
Rivers of poison will wash us away; we're drifting towards the end

Terrified by horror visions, hammered into your brains
The last judgment will come soon, is this the end?

Darkness and shadows are covering the sky
We're drifting towards the end
Rivers of poison will wash us away
We're drifting towards the end
Drifting towards the end
Drifting towards the end

Drifting towards the end
Drifting towards the end
