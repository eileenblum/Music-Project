Paralyzed with fear
Darkness in my eyes
I'm suffering, suffering, from this endless pain
Paralyzed with hate
Helpless and so weak
There's no justice, see me dying

Why is this world so cruel?
Chased into death
Why is this world so cruel?
Dark clouds will eat me

I am falling deep, fighting endlessly
I am falling deep, fighting endlessly

Another innocent victim out there
Another innocent victim out there
Victim out there, victim out there

People are so blind
Mankind is so cruel
My misery, misery, never will be end
Anger and despair
Is growing in my head
There's no justice, I am dying

Why is this world so cruel?
Chased into death
Why is this world so cruel?
Dark clouds will eat me

I am falling deep, fighting endlessly
I am falling deep, fighting endlessly

Another innocent victim out there
Another innocent victim out there
Victim out there, victim out there

Another innocent victim out there
Another innocent victim out there
Victim out there, victim out there

Another innocent victim out there
Another innocent victim out there
