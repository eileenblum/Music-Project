Religion at war
Shoot out in the morning
Religion at war
Never more will you be free

Destruction, hunger and poverty
Blood crusts over your eyes

Humans are bastards
Mmurderer without heart
Religion is different
No sacred right to kill

Condolence is a foreign word
We rush into destruction
It serves us right
This is the end, this is the end, the end

Religion at war, religious liberty
Religion at war, religious liberty

[Solo]

They showing no mercy
Perfidious reign of terror
Fanatical brothers
Hear the excuse

Holy war, crusade of hate
We rush into extinction
Divine illusion
The sword of hate, the sword of hate, strikes back

Religion at war, religious liberty
Religion at war, religious liberty

Behind your face
inside your heart
your blood is black and frozen

Behind your face
inside your heart
your blood is black and frozen

Born in flame, born in cold
Against the cross, against the moon

Religion at war, religious liberty 
Religion at war, religious liberty
