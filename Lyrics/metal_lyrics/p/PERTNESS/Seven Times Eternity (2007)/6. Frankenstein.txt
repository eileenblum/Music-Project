Frankenstein, time has come
Time has come to take revenge

I'm the monster, I'm your deed
My creator, your own beast

Look at me doctor, what have you done?
You have created, a fatherless son

Frankenstein, time has come
Time has come to take revenge

Frankenstein, time has come
Time has come to take revenge

Playing god is not a game
for this crime you'll bleed
You will suffer endless pain
Farewell Frankenstein

Doctor, doctor so obsessed
With demons you were possessed

Nevermore will you live
For all time you'll feel the pain

Black lips, ghastly yellow skin
Lightning woke me up to life

Look at me doctor, what a shame
You never gave me but one name

Time has come - Frankenstein
Time has come to take revenge

Frankenstein - time has come
time has come to take revenge

Playing god is not a game
For this crime you'll bleed
You will suffer endless pain
Farewell Frankenstein

Doctor, doctor so obsessed
With demons you were possessed

Nevermore will you live
For all time you'll feel the pain

Frankenstein - time has come
time has come to take revenge

Playing god is not a game
For this crime you'll bleed
You will suffer endless pain
Farewell Frankenstein

Doctor, doctor so obsessed
With demons you were possessed

Nevermore will you live
For all time you'll feel the pain
