Evil in veil, he's the angel of the dark
In this night he wants to end my life
Darkness will come with the angel of the dark
I will fight for another life

Horror storm
In the dark
Living in death
In eternal live

Twilight grey
Night wind grows cold
Raging wild to death

Twilight grey
Night wind grows cold
Fight for my life tonight

Evil in veil, he's the angel of the dark
In this night he wants to end my life
Darkness will come with the angel of the dark
I will fight for another life

Morbid dreams
Panic grows
Frozen to death
Past sins cut like a knife

Burning souls
Torture my mind
I can not forget

Burning souls
Torture my mind
Sins that can be forgiven

Evil in veil, he's the angel of the dark
In this night he wants to end my life
Darkness will come with the angel of the dark
I will fight for another life
