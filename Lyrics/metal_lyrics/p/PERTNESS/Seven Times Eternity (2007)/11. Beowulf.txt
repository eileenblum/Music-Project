Look to the sky
what do you see?
tell me what you feel

The fall of night
has just begun
Grendel brings us death tonight

Beowulf, Beowulf
he is the Lord of warriors
Beowulf, Beowulf
of all heroes ever

With glory and might
he won every fight

With power and glory

Look in his eyes
death's what you see
Grendel wants your blood

between his claws
brute slaughtering
until Beowulf appears

Beowulf, Beowulf
he is the Lord of warriors
Beowulf, Beowulf
of all heroes ever

With glory and might
he won every fight

With power and glory
