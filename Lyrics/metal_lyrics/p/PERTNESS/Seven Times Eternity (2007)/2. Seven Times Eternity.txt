In the land where the shadows lie
Where a dark lord reigns with seel
Frozen cold and black darkened sky
And all men are damned to die

Seven years fear of the time to go
Seven years full of pain

Seven times eternity
Under the sky
Seven years of waiting
In their halls of stone
Mortal men are doomed to die
Mortal men are doomed to die

In the dark in the underground
Where the lord's priest can't reach them
They are waiting for deliverance
Because the time will soon have come

Seven years fear of the time to go
Seven years full of pain

Seven times eternity
Under the sky
Seven years of waiting
In their halls of stone
Mortal men are doomed to die
Mortal men are doomed to die

[Solo]

Seven years fear of the time to go
Seven years full of pain

Seven times eternity
Under the sky
Seven years of waiting
In their halls of stone
Mortal men are doomed to die
Mortal men are doomed to die

Seven times eternity
Under the sky
Seven years of waiting
In their halls of stone
Mortal men are doomed to die
Mortal men are doomed to die

Seven times eternity
Under the sky
Seven years of waiting
In their halls of stone
Mortal men are doomed to die
Mortal men are doomed to die
