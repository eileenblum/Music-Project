The morning mist
Over the hill
Lies there to rest
Silent and still

Before the fight begins
And drives the mist away

Roars of thunder drone
Into the silence fall
Blow up to dust
Father death you call

Hail Mary full of grace
Take us away from here

Darkness and fire, dust in the wind
Louder than thunder, louder than hell
Swallowed by the black clouds lost on the hill
Brave and proud we never run away

Dirt, bits of rock
Dash us to the ground
Forever we are lost
In stone fetters bound

We're waiting for the end
The time has come right now

Darkness and fire, dust in the wind
Louder than thunder, louder than hell
Swallowed by the black clouds lost on the hill
Brave and proud we never run away

[Solo]

Darkness and fire, dust is in the wind
Louder than thunder, louder than hell

Darkness and fire, dust is in the wind
Louder than thunder, louder than hell

Darkness and fire, dust in the wind
Louder than thunder, louder than hell

Darkness and fire, dust in the wind
Louder than thunder, louder than hell
Swallowed by the black clouds lost on the hill
Brave and proud we never run away

Darkness and fire, dust in the wind, in the wind
Louder than thunder, louder than hell
