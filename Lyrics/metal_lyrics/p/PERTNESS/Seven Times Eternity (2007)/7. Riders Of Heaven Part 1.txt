Behind the sun
Behind the sky
Far away from here

Behind the black
Behind the stars
Out in endless space

There is a place where I come from
I had to go away
But now there is no place for me
Just death is everywhere

Travelling into the hole of time
Beneath heaven and the stars
Seek the key of eternal live
Grey twilight soon will come

Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Once the wind of death will blow
Arise now arise, now riders of heaven
Before the evil can grow

[Solo]

Through space and time
In loneliness
I travelled through the dark

I passed the sun
I passed the moon
And that's when I found you

But I don't know how long I'll stay
Until I have to go
Because your home will fade away
And the wind of death will blow

Travelling into the hole of time
Beneath heaven and the stars
Seek the key of eternal live
Grey twilight soon will come

Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Once the wind of death will blow
Arise now arise, now riders of heaven
Before the evil can grow

Travelling into the hole of time
Beneath heaven and the stars
Seek the key of eternal live
Grey twilight soon will come

Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Once the wind of death will blow
Arise now arise, now riders of heaven
Before the evil can grow
