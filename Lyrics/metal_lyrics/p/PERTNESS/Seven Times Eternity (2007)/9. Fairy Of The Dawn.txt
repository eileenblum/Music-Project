Born with wisdom
Born with force
Saviour of our land

Brave with pride
He showed no fear
A long way he had to go

Through fire, through ice
Like a spirit he flew
Over mountains and valleys
Even faster than the wind

Bring me water from the well
Of the fairy of the dawn
That the future will go on
And my eyes return to laugh

Far, far away
Where the heaven touches the earth
Where the stars kiss the flowers
There you'll find this fairy

[Solo]

Stormy winds
Hot dragons flame
Tried to break his way

Black in mind
His only friend
Could not stop his ride

Black demons, wild beasts
And monsters he fought
For the freedom of his kingdom
And the future of his land

Bring me water from the well
Of the fairy of the dawn
That the future will go on
And my eyes return to laugh

Far, far away
Where the heaven touches the earth
Where the stars kiss the flowers
There you'll find this fairy

[Solo]

Far, far away
Where the heaven touches the earth
Where the stars kiss the flowers
There you'll find this fairy

Of the fairy
Of the fairy of the dawn
