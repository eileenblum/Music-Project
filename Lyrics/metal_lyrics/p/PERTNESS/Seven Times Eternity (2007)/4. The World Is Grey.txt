When will the scars fade from our face
The scars of out fight against this evil
Someday all the shadows will fall
And the sun will shine again

Somewhere behind the mountains
Far away from our home
We walk through woods and meadows
And cross dark moors by night

The pain grows deeper every day
With memories recalled of a better world
Where freedom ruled, and sun would shine
Where fears and tears had no place

The world is grey
Beneath the red burning sky
Behind the shadows all will die

The world is grey
Never more the sun will shine
Damned forever in this gloomy land

Further we pierce into the darkness
Darkness is all around and everywhere
Claws at our heart, tears at our soul
Rips into our mind and destroys our dreams

The pain grows deeper every day
With memories recalled of a better world
Where freedom ruled, and sun would shine
Where fears and tears had no place

The world is grey
beneath the red burning sky
Behind the shadows all will die

The world is grey
never more the sun will shine
Damned forever in this gloomy land

In the name of the ring we fight, fight together and still
We don't know, when all this will end
We're brothers and sisters
But the countdown to extinction, goes on its final end
The last words aren't spoken, but we're only
A few steps away, from a better world

[Solo]

When will the scars fade from our face
The scars of out fight against this evil
Someday all the shadows will fall
And the sun will shine again

Somewhere behind the mountains
Far away from our home
We walk through woods and meadows
And cross dark moors by night

The pain grows deeper every day
With memories recalled of a better world
Where freedom ruled, and sun would shine
Where fears and tears had no place

The world is grey
Beneath the red burning sky
Behind the shadows all will die

The world is grey
Never more the sun will shine
Damned forever in this gloomy land
