Behind the sun
behind the sky
far away from here

Behind the black
behind the stars
in endless space

There's a place where I come from
I had to go away
But now there's no place for me
just death is everywhere

Into the hole
Of darkness we fall
Ever lost in time
For life

Demons and bastards, crawling out of hell
Evil and madness, everywhere

Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Once the wind of death will blow
Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Before the evil can grow

[Solo]

Into the dark
they will take you
far away from here

Believe in me
Twilight will grow
darkness is on the way

Time is near when it's too late
don't do the same as we did
seek the key to end this fate
before it is too late

Into the hole
of darkness we fall
ever lost in time
for life

Demons and bastards, crawling out of hell
Evil and madness, everywhere

Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Once the wind of death will blow
Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Before the evil can grow

Demons and bastards, crawling out of hell
Evil and madness, everywhere

Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Once the wind of death will blow
Arise now, arise now, riders of heaven
Before the evil can grow
