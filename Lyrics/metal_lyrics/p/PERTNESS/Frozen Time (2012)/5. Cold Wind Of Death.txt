Can't stop, my will
The force is rising
At last I found the key
To ignite this process now

Driven by craze
I start the fire
Abortion? No plan!
Now it's too late

Cold wind of death
Symphony of frozen flames
Cold wind of death
I'm fro-zen, nailed to the ground

Blizzards, black holes
Annihilation
Misery and desperation
Spread all over the world

A cloud of death
Devastating power
No chance to turn back time
This is the end

Cold wind of death
Symphony of frozen flames
Cold wind of death
I'm fro-zen, nailed to the ground

Deadly storms, freezing flames
Say farewell to the world
Frozen hell, beyond the starlight
All hope is gone

[Solo]

Into the night - into the darkness
Annihilation - cold lasting fire
Into the night - without no light
Annihilation - the world is afire

Cold wind of death
(We can't harness the power)
Symphony of frozen flames
(We've awakened the hidden force)
Cold wind of death
(We can't harness the power)
I'm fro-zen, nailed to the ground
(We've awakened the hidden force)

[Solo]

Cold wind of death
Symphony of frozen flames
Cold wind of death
I'm fro-zen, nailed to the ground

Deadly storms, freezing flames
Say farewell to the world
Frozen hell, beyond the starlight
All hope is gone

Cold wind of death
Symphony of frozen flames
Cold wind of death
I'm fro-zen, nailed to the ground

Cold wind, cold wind of death
Cold wind of death, I'm fro-zen to the ground
