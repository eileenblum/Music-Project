I wish he could talk to me
Read my own memory
Release me from all the pain
You'll be the only one

And now, he's back, I'm on track
Sunshine will replace the dark
Hypnotized by his words
I will be healed to death

No, no more messiah tale
No evil will prevail
No, no more messiah
No more liar

My pain becomes worse and worse
The answer has been blown away
I was riding the last thread of hope
No I, I have gone insane

I wish I could feel the sun
Read my own memory
Waiting for the next defeat
I'll be the face of death

No, no more messiah tale
No evil will prevail
No, no more messiah
No more liar

No, no more messiah tale
No evil will prevail
No, no more messiah
No more liar

No, no more messiah tale
No evil will prevail
No, no more messiah
No more liar

No, no more messiah tale
No evil will prevail
No, no more messiah
No more liar

No, no more messiah tale
No evil will prevail
No, no more messiah
No more liar
