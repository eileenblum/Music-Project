There's nothing that will be the same
My life has no worth anymore
My world just caved in, you are a liar
I'm falling down into despair

Nevermore, I will be, blinded by your lies
I'm drifting into chaos
I bid, I bid farewell to the past
I bid, I bid, I bid, I bid farewell to the past

The fire still burns in my head
My feelings are turning around
Chaos so far, my power is dying
I'm bleeding out into the dark

Nevermore, I will be, blinded by your lies
I'm drifting into chaos
I bid, I bid farewell to the past

The final illusion has died
My memories are falling apart
I'm filled up with pain, deception and anger
Reality comes to my mind

Nevermore, I will be blinded by your lies
I'm drifting into chaos
I bid, I bid farewell to the past

The fire still burns in my head
My feelings are turning around
Chaos so far, my power is dying
I'm bleeding out into the dark

Nevermore, I will be blinded by your lies
I'm drifting into chaos
I bid, I bid farewell to the past
I bid, I bid, I bid, I bid farewell to the past
