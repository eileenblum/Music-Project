I see suffering, I see pain
I feel hatred, raging death
Always asking the reason why
Under fire, far too long

Lost in time, frozen time
Trapped and forsaken somewhere in time
Don't know why, frozen sky
Trapped and forsaken somewhere in time

I am drifting through my life
Eternal silence, no resort
This confusion made me sick
Full of sorrows, far too long

Lost in time, frozen time
Days of silence under fresh winter snow
Lost in time, too late to die
Trapped and forsaken, so please let me go

Lost in time, frozen time
Days of silence under fresh winter snow
Lost in time, too late to die
Trapped and forsaken, so please let me go

Lost in time, frozen time
Trapped and forsaken somewhere in time
Don't know why, frozen sky
Trapped and forsaken somewhere in time

Lost in time, frozen time
Days of silence under fresh winter snow
Lost in time, too late to die
Trapped and forsaken, so please let me go
