Blazing fires, an ancient tale
A mystery of a past time, hell awaits, the sky will fall

The darkest grey, enfolded darkness
A frozen fog disguised as evil breath in the wind

Words of chaos, pictures of death
The misery is rising, nights of anguish and despair

The darkest grey, enfolded darkness
A frozen fog disguised as evil breath in the wind

Frozen time in darkness dwells, will this ever end?
Shadows rule in loneliness, time can never mend!
Frozen time in darkness dwells, will this ever end?
Shadows rule in loneliness, time can never mend!

[Solo]

Frozen time in darkness dwells, will this ever end?
Shadows rule in loneliness, time can never mend!
Frozen time in darkness dwells, will this ever end?
Shadows rule in loneliness, time can never mend!

Signs of future, apocalyptic dreams
Pushed around by reality and fiction, maximized delirium

The darkest grey, enfolded darkness
A frozen fog disguised as evil breath in the wind

Frozen time in darkness dwells, will this ever end?
Shadows rule in loneliness, time can never mend!
Frozen time in darkness dwells, will this ever end?
Shadows rule in loneliness, time can never mend!

Frozen Time
Frozen Time
Frozen Time
Frozen Time
