All I see are pictures of pain
Crying kids, looking so sad
Endless fear is written in their face
Lost and confused into the future

Misery, is hammered in my brain
Helplessness, is what a feel
Dramatised by our media
I can't resist, I'm inoculated

I sold all my remorse
I don't feel no sorrow
I feel nothing anymore
And I'm back into life, once again

Fundraisers force to donate
Charity at any price
War of greed, money rules the world
Pack of lies and manipulation

Waging war on hunger and disease
All I hear are slogans of lies
In their hands new weapons do appear
Donation in vain, the needy get nothing

I sold all my remorse
I don't feel no sorrow
I feel nothing anymore
And I'm back into life, once again

[Solo]

I sold all my remorse
I don't feel no sorrow
I feel nothing anymore
And I'm back into life, once again
