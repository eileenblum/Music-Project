Your words are poisoning my mind
Your doll face blinds my eyes
Denial of the truth
Until my will is broken
You tell it comes from inside
I hate my inner self
Denial of the truth
Until my heart has gone

My will - my will is broken
Boundless greed and no remorse - All has gone
My will - my will is broken
I'm the victim of your smile - Denial of the truth

Your lies are feeding more lies
I can't find no way out
Denial of the truth
Until my will is broken
I'm brainwashed the whole day long
I have gone much too far
Denial of the truth
Until my heart has gone

My will - my will is broken
Boundless greed and no remorse - All has gone
My will - my will is broken
I'm the victim of your smile - Denial of the truth

[Solo]

Merciless poison is running through my soul
Isolation in my mind, delusional belief
Glorifying ignorance leads me to the grave
Distortion of reality behind this mask of pain

My will - my will is broken
Boundless greed and no remorse - All has gone
My will - my will is broken
I'm the victim of your smile - Denial of the truth
