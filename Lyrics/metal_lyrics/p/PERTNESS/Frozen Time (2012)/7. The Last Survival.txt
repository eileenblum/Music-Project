Volcanic eruptions and solar storms
Tomorrow is coming, we'll drown in blood
Deluges and blizzards, or waves of heat
The forces of Nature will kill us all

The last survival, in between live and death
Revival, revival, forever done
The last survival, extinction waits for - everyone
The last survival, a deadly race
The writing's on the wall

The last survival, alone in the dark
The last survival, disappears in the grey of night

Destruction, pollution, genetic wars
Repression of warnings - is daily fare
Nuclear disasters and toxic fumes
The forces of mankind against the earth

The last survival, in between live and death
Revival, revival, forever done
The last survival, extinction waits for - everyone
The last survival, a deadly race
The writing's on the wall

The last survival, alone in the dark
The last survival, disappears in the grey of night

The last survival, in between live and death
Revival, revival, forever done
The last survival, extinction waits for - everyone
The last survival, a deadly race
The writing's on the wall
