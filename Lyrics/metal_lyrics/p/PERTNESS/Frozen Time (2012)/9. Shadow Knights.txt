Systematic hate production, focus on a fading world
Inoculation of deadly fear - deadly fear - deadly fear

No more salvation welcome to death, there is any grace at all
I'm a sinner, I'm sodomized - I'm betrayed - betrayed

There's no justice in this world
There's no justice in this world
No justice in this world

Domination, fear replication
Revelation of hate, shadow knights
Resignation, intoxication
Shadow will lie around the world
Shadow knights
Shadow will lie around the world

We are healers, we are God, we got to hold all in our hands
Revolution is your death - is your death - your death

We are preying on the weak, but we don't give a damn
Domination is what we learned, that's what we are fighting for

There's no justice in this world
There's no justice in this world
No justice in this world

Domination, fear replication
Revelation of hate, shadow knights
Resignation, intoxication
Shadow will lie around the world
Shadow knights
Shadow will lie around the world

[Solo]

Domination, fear replication
Revelation of hate, shadow knights
Resignation, intoxication
Shadow will lie around the world
Shadow knights
Shadow will lie around the world
