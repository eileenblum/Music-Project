I went through nights of horror
Had to suffer torments of hell
I will never do it again
I prefer to die

I have to fight for my life
Waiting for the therapy
The fear is rising again
'Cause I know the pain

The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm

I only wish it was over
I'm paralyzed with fear
Will this nightmare ever end?
Do I have to die?

The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm

[Solo]

The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm
