Home in the evening, turn out the light
Tell yourself it's gonna be alright
Sleep don't come easy, feelin' like hell
The dogs are still chasin' the hole that you fell

Bad situation, you walk out the door
Saw the temptation was the final straw
Well, you try to control it but something's got to give
Don't want to die, but you're too scared to live

Time is a hunter

Time is a hunter

So out of touch seems so unreal
Can't face the truth, got to know how you feel
All gets too much, seems so unreal
Got to turn 'round, come down and put your feet back on the ground

Well, the tower is high and the river runs deep
And the weight in my heart is too much to keep
Adrift in an ocean of pain and despair
Hands keep me down as I come up for air

Time is a hunter

Time is a hunter

So out of touch, seems so unreal
Can't face the truth, got to know how you feel
All gets too much, seems so unreal
Got to turn 'round, look down and get your feet back on the ground
'Cause time is a hunter
