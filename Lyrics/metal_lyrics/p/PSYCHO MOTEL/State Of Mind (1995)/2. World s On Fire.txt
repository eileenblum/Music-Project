Good people turn your head
Listen what your good book says
You're preaching kill and maim
Religion is your game

Fight - you'll never be right

This world's on fire
Sinking higher and higher
See now, the liar
This world's on fire

White noise goin' through my veins
Emotion can't explain
Oh child, take me by the hand
Blow you straight into the Promised Land

Fight - you'll never be right

This world's on fire
Sinking higher and higher
See now, the liar
This world's on fire

Good people turn your head
Listen what your good book says
Your bullets kill and maim
Red, black, white, it's all the same

Fight - you'll never be right

This world's on fire
Sinking higher and higher
See now, the liar
This world's on fire
