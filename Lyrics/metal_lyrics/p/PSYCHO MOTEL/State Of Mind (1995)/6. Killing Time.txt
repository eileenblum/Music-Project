In this place, we're killin' time
Money talks, we tow the line
Pump that mud into the sea
Baby's born to pain and misery

See that fire up in the sky
Burning holes, skin to fry
Keep them free from your disease
If you ain't got the dollars, you can't be free

I got a right to know
Let the truth be known
I got a right to know

Save me from the killing time
Save me, I'm not your kind
Save me from the killing time
Save me

No more sun to light your sky
No more souls for you to buy
Money's gone, power too
Judgement day comin' up on you

I got a right to know
Let the truth be known
I got a right to know

Save me from the killing time
Save me, I'm not your kind
Save me from the killing time
Save me, I'm not your kind
Save me
