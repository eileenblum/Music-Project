Standing underneath the rainbow
Looking at the sun, I don't need a gun
Armed with my remote control
Watching all the fun, they might kill someone
Heard about the curfew
But I'm leaving town tonight, in my own jet-plane
Major's gonna make a speech
Says everything's alright, it's soon over now

Waiting for the avalanche and churning out the lies
Telling all the people that this is a big surprise

There's a rage - rising in my neighborhood
There's a rage - going on and on and on
You and my are sitting by the pool

So you think I'm ruthless
Obnoxious kind of guy, I do charity
Gonna throw a barbecue
For paupers in Bel Air, they adore me

Waiting for the avalanche and churning out the lies
Telling all the people that this is a big surprise

There's a rage - rising in my neighborhood
There's a rage - going on and on and on
You and my are sitting by the pool

Waiting for the avalanche and churning out the lies
Telling all the people that this is a big surprise

There's a rage - rising in my neighborhood
There's a rage - going on and on and on
You and my are sitting by the pool
