Electric tears are falling, fall like rain
Ride on your misfortune like a train
Feed that burning anger into that child
Wind him up with hatred running wild

Take a listen to the howling wind
Take you with it, never seen again
Take a listen to the howling wind

And when the morning breaks
I know, I know, I know
Nobody foolin'
Living on past mistakes
You try, you try, you try
You'll never change it
Sins of your father

I heard that child was calling out my name
I turned a deaf ear to him just the same
Now you've grown so twisted and your pain
Has turned into a dagger used for gain

Take a listen to the howling wind
Take you with it, never seen again
Take a listen to the howling wind

And when the morning breaks
I know, I know, I know
Nobody foolin'
Living on past mistakes
You try, you try, you try
You'll never change it
Sins of your father

Take a listen to the howling wind
Take you with it, never seen again
Take a listen to the howling wind

And when the morning breaks
I know, I know, I know
Nobody foolin'
Living on past mistakes
You try, you try, you try
You'll never change it
Sins of your father
