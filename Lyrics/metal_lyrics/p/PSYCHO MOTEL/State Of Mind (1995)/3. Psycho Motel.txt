Here's a man that's got no reason
Here's a man that's got no friends
Here's a child that got no love now
Here he comes, now he's gonna make amends

Got a room that's full of pictures
Pretty women in leather and lace
At night, he hears those voices
Hears them tell it to him right into his face

Alone in the darkness, I see your face
It drifts through my dreams without a trace

I was feeling rough and weary
I wasn't feeling too well
And since my baby left me
I checked in at Psycho Motel

Here's a man that got the power
Here's a man that's badder than hell
Here's a man making speeches on TV
You'll find him down at the Psycho Motel

Alone in the darkness, I see your face
It drifts through my dreams without a trace

The world was rough and weary
I wasn't feeling too well
And since my baby left me
I checked in at Psycho Motel
