Excuse me, will you pardon me for saying
I've been loving you for such a long, long time

Excuse me, but I feel the light is fading
And I guess I misinterpreted the signs
Excuse me, for intruding on your privacy
Fences that you build to ease the pain

Hope you don't mind
Hope you don't mind
Hope you don't mind

Miss Delilah, where's my heart and home
Miss Delilah, playing in her dome

Excuse me for requiring your honesty
I can see your shadow dancing on the wall
Excuse me but the truth is hiding in your dreams
If you climb the crosses, you must risk the fall

You were so right
You were so right
You were so right

Miss Delilah, where's my heart and home?
Miss Delilah, playing in her dome
It's been a sunny day, such a sunny day
Miss Delilah, where's my heart and home?

Hope you don't mind
Hope you don't mind
Hope you don't mind

Miss Delilah, where's my heart and home?
Miss Delilah, playing in her dome
It's been a sunny day, such a sunny day
Miss Delilah, where's my heart and home?
