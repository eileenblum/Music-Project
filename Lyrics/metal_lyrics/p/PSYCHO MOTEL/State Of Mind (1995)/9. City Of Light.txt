Not word, can't hear a sound
Nobody seen, no one around
I'm in a sweat, can't stand the heat
I feel, risin' from the city street

I'm in a rage, I can't contain
Someone free from the endless pain
I tried so hard, it can't be fair
I'm circled by the vultures of despair

Somebody try to help me

Guess what's going down
In the city of lights
Darkness all around
In the city of lights

Been pushed too far, you had enough
Just a boy but you act so tough
The fruits of evil, they taste so sweet
Nobody told you 'bout the poison meat

He's in a rage, he can't contain
Like a drug that's shooting through his veins
You try to scream but there's no sound
You're movin' closer to the hallowed ground

Somebody try to help me

Guess what's going down
In the city of lights
Darkness all around
In the city of lights

Somebody try to help me

Guess what's going down
In the city of lights
Darkness all around
In the city of lights
