Welcome to the world we live
Quick to blame but you never give
Greed is good and you count every dime
Can't buy me love if you ain't got the time

Welcome the this world we live
Quick to blame but you never give
Round and round and around we go
Playing God is a one-man show

Fly high on your way to paradise

As you lie to my face through your disguise
Steal the dreams from the world you hate
No turning back 'cause it's much too late
Tell yourself that you're just a man
Feel the power slip right through your hands

Fly high on your way to paradise
As you lie to my face through your disguise
Fly high on your way to paradise

As you lie to my face through your disguise
Well, I'm searching, searching for a remedy
Look around, I can't find it here
Searching, searching for a remedy
Well, I'm searching, searching for a remedy
Look around, I can't find it here
Searching, searching for a remedy

Welcome to the end of time
Now your greed is as weak as mine
Can't hold back the returning tide
Money can't keep your soul alive

Fly high on your way to paradise
As you lie to my face through your disguise
Fly high on your way to paradise
As you lie to my face through your disguise
