Sometimes I feel like a Mother Nature's restless child
You beg and steal, along the way you lose your pride
You make a deal, as poison ivy grows inside
Life ain't easy for a Mother Nature's restless child

You make deal, a bargain that will compromise you
So unreal, no rhyme or reason stops you feeling
Can't break these chains, they hold down, destroy your pride
Life ain't easy for a Mother Nature's restless child

Feed another child to the machine
Poison other minds and wash your hands clean
Watch another mind get left behind
Make of Mother Nature's restless child

Where you going now - wasting your tomorrow's
Are you up or down - or are you underground?
Where you going now - life ain't yours to borrow

Are you up or down - or are you underground?
You hide your time, you pay the price, you crossed the line
Life ain't easy 'cause underground, the sun don't shine

Feed another child to the machine
Poison other minds and wash your hands clean
Watch another mind get left behind
Nothing ever grows with the light

Where you going now - wasting your tomorrow's
Are you up or down - or are you underground?
Where you going now - life ain't yours to borrow
Are you up or down - or are you underground?
Where you going now - wasting your tomorrow's
Are you up or down - or are you underground?
Where you going now - life ain't yours to borrow
Are you up or down - or are you underground?
