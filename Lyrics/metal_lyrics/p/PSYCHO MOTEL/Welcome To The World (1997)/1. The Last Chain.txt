I thought them free these highs of mine
But there's a price to pay
That bides its time

I am only what I can be
You don't understand me
Pull the darkness tight around
See the barcode on my neck here
It's the same as last year
I am not my own
I am the last chain that fills your mind
Flows through your veins
I am the white line you dared to cross

For the last time
Addiction slowly wrapped around
The place I once thought solid ground
And now my highs just bring me down
I try to scream but I can't make a sound

I am only what I can be
You don't understand me
Pull the darkness tight around
See the barcode on my neck here
It's the same as last year
I am not my own

I am the last chain that fills your mind
Flows through your veins
I am the white line you dared to cross

For the last time
I am only what I can be
You don't understand me
Pull the darkness tight around
See the barcode on my neck here
It's the same as last year
I am not my own

I am the last chain that fills your mind
Flows through your veins
I am the white line you dared to cross
For the last time
