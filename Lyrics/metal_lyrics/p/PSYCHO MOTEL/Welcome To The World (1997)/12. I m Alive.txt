You make me believe that the poison
Is wrapped round my mind
And the way that you use me
It makes me turn cold right inside

When the pressure starts to flow
And the emptiness goes from my mind
I feel alive

And everything you don't understand
And everything you try is underhand
I realize you can't bring me down

I'm alive...
I'm alive...
I'm alive...
I'm alive...

The smoke in my eyes made me
Turn from the lies that you made
While you'll never change
You won't ever be the same again to me

When the pressure starts to flow
And the emptiness goes from my mind
I feel alive

And everything you don't understand
And everything you try is underhand
I realize you can't bring me down

And everything you don't understand
And everything you try is underhand
I realize you can't bring me down

I'm alive...
I'm alive...
I'm alive...
I'm alive...
