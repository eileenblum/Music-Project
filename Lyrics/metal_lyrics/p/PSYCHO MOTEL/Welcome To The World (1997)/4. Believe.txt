Jesus Christ in porcelain
Wrapped in silver paper
Put him on the mantelpiece
An ornamental savior

Find a reason to believe
Say your prayers at night
Keep those nightmares from your door
Hold onto the light

Searching through emptiness
Can't find your way
A long way from Heaven
With nothing to say

How can I believe?
When I don't understand
How the faith of one of your children
Can be so easily damned

Convenience is your main theme
You pray when the money is tight
Your God is kind, he understands
That you only pray when you fight

Searching through emptiness
Can't find your way
A long way from Heaven
With nothing to say

How can I believe?
When I don't understand
How the faith of one of your children
Can be so easily damned
How can I believe?
When I don't understand
How the faith of one of your children
Can be so easily damned

Searching through emptiness
Can't find your way
A long way from Heaven
With nothing to say

How can I believe?
When I don't understand
How the faith of one of your children
Can be so easily damned
How can I believe?
When I don't understand
How the faith of one of your children
Can be so easily damned
It's make-believe
It's make-believe
It's make-believe
It's make-believe
