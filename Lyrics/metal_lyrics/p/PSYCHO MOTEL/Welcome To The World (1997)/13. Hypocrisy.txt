Can you see the hypocrisy of living in the past?
You're holding tight to a different light
And that it will never last

It's the same, there ain't nobody to blame
You can't just remember the line
It's a fear that there's nobody near
To stop you, just wasting this time

Breaking down my energy, I can't be alone
It's so dark that I can't see, I can't be alone

Stop me now 'cause I'm feeling that I can't hold it together

I don't know

Break me down, I can't stop the empty feeling in my mind

In my mind
Can you see the hypocrisy that's cried out in our tears?
We feed the lies that are yours and mine
As they grow throughout the years

It's a crime that time after time, we pull ourselves away
From a life that just can't be right with nobody to blame

Breaking down my energy, I can't be alone
It's so dark that I can't see, I can't be alone

Stop me now 'cause I'm feeling that I can't hold it together
I don't know
Break me down, I can't stop the empty feeling in my mind
In my mind
Stop me now 'cause I'm feeling that I can't hold it together
I don't know
Break me down, I can't stop the empty feeling in my mind
In my mind
Breaking down my energy, I can't be alone
It's so dark that I can't see, I can't be alone

Stop me now 'cause I'm feeling that I can't hold it together
I don't know

Break me down, I can't stop the empty feeling in my mind
In my mind
Stop me now 'cause I'm feeling that I can't hold it together
I don't know
Break me down, I can't stop the empty feeling in my mind
In my mind
