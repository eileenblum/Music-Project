Skies on fire - those tears aren't mine
Dreams are gone - they saved no one
Don't blame me 'cause I don't feel

You can see the way we are
Yeah, we don't know we're blind
You can see how lost we are
Yeah, life is so unkind

Hey - no loss to me

Hey - no loss to me
We feed the flames - we greed again
A darkness made from endless pain

You can see the way we are
Yeah, we don't know we're blind
You can see how lost we are
Yeah, life is so unkind

Hey - no loss to me
Hey - no loss to me
You can see the way we are
Yeah, we don't know we're blind
You can see how lost we are
Yeah, life is so unkind
Hey - no loss to me
Hey - no loss to me
