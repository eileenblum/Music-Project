Time has
Time has come to lay my burden down
It's too much for my shoulders
Easy
Easy to see clearly now that I have come here
And I'm older

Evil
Evil is the hold you had on me
Sickly sweet did your words flow
Angels
Angels must be whispering in my ear
Time to turn from my shadow

Oh - I keep running
Just don't want to face what's been coming

I lied about my innocence
And who will come to my defense
I lied about my innocence
There's nothing left to say
There's a debt I need to pay

Blinded
Blinded by denial of a world
Filled with shame, filled with hurting
Changing
Changing now the way I that I perceive
What is real, what is certain

Oh - I keep running
Just don't want to face what's been coming

I lied about my innocence
And who will come to my defense
I lied about my innocence
There's nothing left to say

There's a debt I need to pay

I lied about my innocence
And who will come to my defense
I lied about my innocence
There's nothing left to say
There's a debt I need to pay
