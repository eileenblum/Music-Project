Remember my father, he stood against the tide
He loved with laughter, his hope never died
I feel the anger, filled the place I run
Ignore the danger of losing everyone

And I won't make a sound
If I could be there again
And I won't make a sound

If I could be with you again
Forever with me, locked up inside my mind
The pain in your eyes that I cannot deny
I paint a picture, a dreamscape in my mind
Where I am with you, and feeling strong inside

And I won't make a sound
If I could be there again
And I won't make a sound
If I could be with you again
And I won't make a sound
If I could be there again
And I won't make a sound
If I could be with you again
