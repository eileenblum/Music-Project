I was afraid to be left all alone
Even my dreams did not seem like my own
Scared of my shadow, afraid of attack
Out of the blue light and into the black

Love is a dark place where you run away from me

Blinded by your face, I can't run away from you
The silence, it keeps on confusing my mind
Remembering faces from another time
Stealing a kiss from an old photograph
Why can't my memories stay in the past?

Love is a dark place where you run away from me

Blinded by your face, I can't run away from you
Falling towards the dark depths of the lake
Hands reaching out for the life that you take
Desperate to feel the strong pull of the tide
Knowing that somewhere a part of me died

Love is a dark place where you run away from me

Blinded by your face, I can't run away from you
Yeah, I'm falling out of the blue sky and into the black
Yeah, I'm falling out of the blue sky and into the black
Love is a dark place, out of the blue and into the black
