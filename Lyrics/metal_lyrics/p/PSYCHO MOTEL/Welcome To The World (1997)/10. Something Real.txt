I ran the longest mile for you, I can be sure
The strength I once held in my hand
Has now long gone

Do anything for you
You made me leave
Inside my mind, you'll find
The way to make you see

The sight and sound of blackness
Turns the light to shade
And so emptied of feeling, I turn my face away

Do anything for you
You made me leave
Inside my mind, you'll find
The way to make you see

So unreal, it's in the way you feel
You know you can't conceal
You want something real
You try, you can't be denied
Of the way we feel

You want something real
I ran the longest mile for you, I can be sure
The strength I once held in my hand
Has now long gone

Do anything for you
You made me leave
Inside my mind, you'll find
The way to make you see

So unreal, it's in the way you feel
You know you can't conceal
You want something real
You try, you can't be denied
Of the way we feel
You want something real
