Yeah you, you're shining like the sun
Changes like the wind and the weather
Yeah you, you come on like the rain
Like a hurricane, hell for leather

You know, you let the fun, the shining sun
Always passes you by
Tomorrow never comes for those who run
Look to the sky

Rain, look at the rain
Yeah you, your life has just begun
Just oblivion is what you need
Yeah you, you drink a poison cup
When your time is up, you are on your knees

You know, you let the fun, the shining sun
Always passes you by
Tomorrow never comes for those who run
Look to the sky

Rain, look at the rain
You know, you let the fun, the shining sun
Always passes you by
Tomorrow never comes for those who run
Look to the sky

Look at the rain
Look at the rain
Look at the rain
Look at the rain
