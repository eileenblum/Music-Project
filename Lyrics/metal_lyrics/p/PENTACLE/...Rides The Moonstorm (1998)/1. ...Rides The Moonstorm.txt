Blood of the moon is what I taste
Cold and sweat, enchanting perfume
Collonade so bright, the serpent's mind

A glare in my eyes
Watching the esoteric tide
Floating through my mind
Intoxicating time

A glare in my eyes
Watching the esoteric tide
Floating through my mind
Intoxicating time

The eyes of the serpent are dazzling my sanctum
Its illusive stair I indulge in its will
I was shown the winds obscure
And was absorbed, by the fainting dawn

Many mysteries were revealed
Whistled they were through the serpent's mind
The stretching sea on the frozen moon
Is what I witness after years of lethargy

I've heard the whisper of death's immortality
Cold as ice it felt as its hand touched my shoulder
Telling me the tales evoked through the frost of ages
Epoch of the forgotten, a journey through memories

A statue made with the skeleton's eye
Grey as the aura of death
Watch the mark unfold itself
As it deludes your soul

The visions I had
The storm of the moon
Together we shall ride
With eternal pride
