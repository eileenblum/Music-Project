Let me flow throught night's chaos
This night is a reflection of inner most desires
Let me flow through night's chaos
I, who call to you embrace my infernal visions

Worship my flesh, ungodly, yet divine
Worship my thoughts, the sacred blasphemy
Worship my soul, black yet so white
Worship my words, the logic insanity

Again and again, I forsee this ceremony
As the nights unfolds, your candles awaken
You're a child so pure, remember the rose
Surrender to the power, raised by night's chaos

Through fire and its warmth and its colours dancing
It makes the sweet deer turn into a wolf
Night's chaos preying upon your golden flame
Towards the eclipse forseen, behold the crimson star

Raised by night's chaos
My flesh, you crave for its embrace
Raised by night's chaos
Riding over wastelands
Raised by night's chaos
A star heading for collision
Raised by night's chaos
My words are poison in your world of feathers

Raised by night's chaos
My flesh, you crave for its embrace
Raised by night's chaos
Riding over wastelands
Raised by night's chaos
A star heading for collision
Raised by night's chaos
My words are poison in your world of feathers

As I lay here, covered in dust
I caress you as a vivid memory
You who witnessed my departure
Exalt my view of the past
