...You, who thrive on the sea of my unconsciousness...
...Explore the deepness of the depths...

For everything consuming
For everything bearing
Flowing eternally
On which they thrive

Pointing to the emptiness
Serving the right hand
Pointing to the heart
Serving the left hand

The road
For you it's black
For them it's grey
For us it's white

My soul, caressed by both sides
In my sleep, darkness and light

Fighting on my side, covered with damp
Flowers of doom perish in this battle
