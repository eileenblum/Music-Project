As I cry tears of the purest sulphur
As intensity rages through my heart
As its strength lurks deep inside of me
As the star points towards me

Beyond the veil of sulphur - The reign of tribulation
Beyond the veil of sulphur - A restless temptation

As my feelings are guided by passion
As my acts speak out strength
As my eyes light you on fire
As my spell mesmerizes your sanctum 

Beyond the veil of sulphur - The reign of tribulation
Beyond the veil of sulphur - A restless temptation

Weeping, crying a torrent of drops
Deceived by the sulphur blood
Fire, heat, intensity reigns
After ages the frost remains
Chaos, confusion, reality is lost
Harmony is now in your thoughts
The veil of sulphur, ha, I admit
An extraction of the fiery wind

Weeping, crying a torrent of drops
Fire, heat, intensity reigns
Chaos, confusion, reality is lost
The veil of sulphur, ha, I admit

Can you see the fetters of light ?
A foe of the expression of your might
Stalking alone the buried seas
The veil of sulphur I owe it my strength
