I have seen the flames of lust
Scenes of flesh, naked and soft
I touched and felt this obscene rose
Enjoyed its thorns, mysteries are reborn

So tender and pure, embracing my might
Chimera of love, extraction of the night
Wild and warm, lascivious to the end
Carnal salvation, tasting her scent
...Her scent !

Full of passion, I taste the thoughts
Dripping from her skin, the sulphur flood
Marble tongues, entwined with strength
Divine liquid, I will die !

Through centuries and aeons I felt her might
Enslaved by flesh, beauty at night
Look and see, the queen of chaos
Diabolical wishes, origin of malice

The wasteland I searched was fiery and deserted
In a way untouched, but yet she left her marks
Dwelling through fire, the dance of desires
Wandering through ice, the sleep of morbidity

Baptism in a fiery void
Cleansed by the feminine spawn

The marks I beard where black and red
Engraved in my flesh, the signs of denial
Spawned by carnal deeds this "rose" fulfilled its needs
Ecstasy beneath the moon, the mighty and glorious has won

Baptism in a fiery void
Cleansed by the feminine spawn
