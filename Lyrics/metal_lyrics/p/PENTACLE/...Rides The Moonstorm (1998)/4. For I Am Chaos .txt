A tender kiss from chaos I feel
As I lay down upon this bed of tears

For I am chaos !
Emerging as the inverted
For I am chaos !
The dawn of destruction

The harvest of tears caressed by the nothingness
The years howl the requiem of the forsaken

For I am chaos !
Emerging as the inverted
For I am chaos !
The dawn of destruction

Together we feast on eternity's pride, remembrances die
Behold the relic, once so pride, fading from your mind

Together we walk through endless times showing you my might
Wipe off the dust from your obsolete faith and set your mind ablaze

Fly with me on the wings of chaos, let me create
Yous sleeping mind sustains the rush - order shall prevail

After ages senses unfold the creation of obscuration
Chaos is I, creating your mind behold your might

For I am chaos !
Emerging as the inverted
For I am chaos !
The dawn of destruction
