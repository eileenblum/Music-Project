I witness trough your eyes a sacred pale light
Moving through wastelands, unseen by my golden sight

Time after time, visions through my mind
I never dared to see them as they engulf me

So pure are my eyes - I only saw the fetters of light
And touched them, enjoyed them, embraced them, caressed them

The night I witnessed through your eyes, for the first time you let me feel it
A baptism in a fiery void where fire is cold and the void is full

Beauty in the purest sense, deceived by a rose, oh, so cold
Covered by the eve - Rites of the flesh...

...I touch
...I feel
...I smell
...I perish...

...I touch
...I feel
...I smell
...I perish !

Together we love this illusion of chaos as you feel on my innocence
And give me the carnal pleasures of a time forgotten in time

Oh, grant me the eternal caress, let me drift upon forgotten streams
Beyond the beyond - The spell of eternity
