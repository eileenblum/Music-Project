[originally by Mantas]We are the Legion of Doom
We will use you for food
Taking your life, giving death
You should fear for your breath

The dead below are calling your name
It's just a part of their morbid claim
To eat your mind, leave you insane
Bleeding to death, unheard of pain

We are the Legion of Doom
Your time will come very soon
Walk and feed with our kind
Flesh we eat, bones we grind

Killing all in our path
Leaving blood, the stains will last
For those to see, who don't believe
We'll leave in pain, misery
Forbidden terror, has just begun
Our final feast is yet to come

We are the Legion of Doom
Your time will come very soon
Walk and feed with our kind
Flesh we eat, bones we grind
