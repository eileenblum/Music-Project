Approach, you war-torn fiend
Come forward, dealer of death
Find shelter under these fiery wings
As I guide you through the blackened depths
Behold a hazy dimension
Engulfed in man's emotions
Expect no tender feelings
But a bath in gore
The moaning of the deceased ones
Shrouded in the winds
The howling of the past
Told by blackened - bones
The skull is whispering a forgotten tale
Its rotten tongue is tasting your flesh
Your ear is near its yawning mouth
Absorbing the tales of Death
Weeping blood, Devouring lead, Obscurity is filling your mind
Deafening silence, excruciating noise
Immolated in Flames Immolated in Flames
Immolated in Flames Immolated in Flames
An abstract world, secluded and hidden, evoked by Death's embrace
Defying life, Lusting for Death, madness shone out of your eyes
Rattling of grotesque laughter
Stabbing the earth with steal
Your trophy, a handfull of maggots
For the wargod you must kneel
