The masquerade was at an end
The last trump card has been played
Now the fight is on
It's time to raise the White Ensign!
Beattie gave his order for all guns to open fire
The Oerlikens, the twelve Pounder, the Mortars
The Hotchkiss, the Pom-pom, The Brenguns
The Germans didn't wait any longer
And answered their enemy's call by replying with their coastal defenses
To put up a curtain of hail

FIRE! FEUER! From the start the battle wasn't equal
The Germans firing from (fixed and) protected positions
While the British were exposed on exposed on moving platforms
Firing into a blinding white glare After a duel of a few minutes
The British gunners gained superiority
Though it didn't last for long It won them some valuable time
Forward and forward they speeded towards their goal
Closer and closer, came the entrance , the dock and the mole

Here comes the Navy! Focal point of the German fire became the Campletown
Her sides seemed to be alive with bursting shells
The Germans felt the pressure of the firepower of the attackers,
Yet the Campletown took many losses from the moment the action broke loose
Traces, shells, bullets, flying

Beattie and Tibbets kept the ship on a steady coarse
towards it's goal
Defying the searchlights and artillery, onwards she goes
Further...Further...Further...Further...
She goes!...She goes!
