Having Cursed upon the words I say
Desecrate the path I pave
Cleansing of your soul now you will pay
Purified in a sea of flames

I reach out my arms you did not try
Screams rang out to me? A lie
So you try to beg and plead for life
You've chosen your fate to die

The skies break open upon us
A blinding vision of light
Embodied only by a trust
A furious fight
