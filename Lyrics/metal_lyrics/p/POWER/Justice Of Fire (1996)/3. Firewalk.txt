Through the path of doubt we walk
Step upon the flames of lies

Madness now has taken us
Walk the fire to a land of sin

Traveling upon the seas
A point of time in you and me

The fury is within our blood
Walking the fire, it has always been
Why!

Innate within the souls of man
Brought to death cry out for help

Carry sin on, the voice will say
Walk the fire, we are led today

From the lips of the eternal force
Turn your heads, you have been warned
Now!
