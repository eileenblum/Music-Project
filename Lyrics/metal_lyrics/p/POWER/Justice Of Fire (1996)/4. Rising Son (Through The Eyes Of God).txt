Lights breaks through
The sky of fear
An eternal end growing near

Path chosen of words and strength
Cast away our feelings of angst
Son rise forth, to me, see
Through the eyes of God
In time you'll know, see
Through the eyes of God

Passages from time we know
Turned our heads in our biggest mistake
Calling to you can't you hear
A warning now we must not forsake

Son rise forth, to me, see
Through the eyes of God
In time you'll know, see
Through the eyes of God

For you I bleed, see
Through the eyes of God
My fire will grow, see
Through the eyes of

Screaming out those words so clear
A never ending state of disdain

What can I say to make you hear?
I can't hold back this tormenting pain
