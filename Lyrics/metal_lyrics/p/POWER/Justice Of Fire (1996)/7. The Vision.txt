Clouds rolling clearing in the dark sky
A message comes to me I'll describe
Four winds to blow over the sea to be done
In a dream  the vision has now come

Arising from the sea are four beasts
To tread upon the Earth with disease
A sight so clear blinding truth in my eyes
Never to fear the faces of despise

Blackening the torches of light
In a dream the vision is now seen
Tonight!

In the midst of pain, sorrow and death
A tenth King, reigns of peace it is said
Not since the days of ancient disbelief
Has a King suffered all humanity

Father breath your fire from the stars
Extinguish disbelief, within our hearts
A distant voice is calling out for you
In a dream the vision is canting true
