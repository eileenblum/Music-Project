Burning inside your mind
Fear grips your soul
Delusional lies unfortold

Why can't we see through ourselves
Hangs over time moving on

Pain at your doorsteps
Of life looking in,
Thoughts say that are insane

Panic we are stricken
Look ahead, what's to come?
Fire you contest is the way

Why can't we see through ourselves
Hangs over time moving on

Blinded by the words of deceit
To face the unknown
We all walk on the path led astray

Confusion locked inside
You feel enslaved
Prisoner of your own chains

Beaten and battered
You cannot escape
Destiny lies in our fate

Why can't we see through ourselves
Hangs over time moving on

A final solution will dawn
Hangs over time moving on
