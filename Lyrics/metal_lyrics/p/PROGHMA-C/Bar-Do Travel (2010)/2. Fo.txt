I dance in rain of desires and tired dreams
The first, the second, the third
And vilify many
Wherever I look
All I can see are the corpses of those unfinished children of mine
Hung by their necks so peacefully
I killed them in the dark but with the smell they were in the dream once
Not the one I saw they were still standing somewhere close
They had to be seen in a different way they were simply different
Although dreaming of them, I had a visible ideal dream behind the haze of sleep
Still, so distant from the ideal during behind the haze
If the shadows could suggest, and could be assessed
One could be deceased
They have so similar, only kind of who i heard
Meaningless, devoid of the underground
The foundation of their personalities
Without their individualities

So why I cry, 'cause of their teardrops falling
Look me as an iron sighted robot man that confuses
That's the psychedelia of the mind the reels and strikes down
The size of someone elseâs ego, spilling so much
Having so much energy flowing from this,
That I am losing myself
In everything that urges me
Even everything that urges me

So be live

I canât feel my, my own shame
Still a visionaire
I canât see my own
I cant really hear
'Cause you be me, me is you
?
Always in fear, never here
'Cause is everything

I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind
Living like this going my way
I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind
Living like this going my way
I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind
Living like this going my way
I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind I donât mind!
Living like this going my way

Repeat
Donât question seventeen thousand times
No doubt
No questions
there is another life
Give me your time and give me your bluff
Donât testify
No
(There will be another life)
Repeat
Donât question seventeen thousand times
No doubt
Donât question
There is another life
Give me your time and give me your bluff
Donât testify
No

There will be another

Death to an enemy
Are you mine
Death to an enemy
Take them, bring me
Take me
Both
Body and mind
Body and mind, get mine
to eternity
body and mind
to eternity
