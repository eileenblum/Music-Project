I canât smell
You are near me
How could I not realize
Youâre getting out of my nose

I have no fear of the final step
It will be in your footprints
It's like you are sleeping
But I have no dreams
And the dreams

Eight million four hundred thousand times I escaped to find you
Even if I found my body to be regressive so much
My last trial is to lay and look, not sing
Where is no time, Iâll take my heater? and Iâll do a play?
My only hope is to feel emphatic like a stone
Where is no time, Iâll take my heater? and Iâll do a play?

'Cause I hate every single moment without you without you, with myself
Me makes no soundsâ¦ you wonât be ???

Derationalize
Perfect
Combination
My hand is not the sea storm
My hands are not the falling skies
Million times one after one one after one
Million times one after one one after one one after one

Like desires in my ego
My thoughts of you
Even if you are not god, yes I know there is no god at all
Go ahead, glorify, I glorify
Every sunrise through your veins, every sunrise through your veins
Every sunrise!

I am looking for a confusion that will prove I donât exist
As a reflection of a same old laceration
There is no silence, there is no absence
Noise in these veins is enough
To feel alive, so alive

Oh
My brothers, my brothers
My brothers
My fathers, my fathers
My fathers
My brothers, mothers, sis

One man reattached
My fragile bones
Life is gently sure of this
Leering down near the absence
Can't illuminate
With you naan in front of me
Can't illuminate without you

'Cause itâs like
You went distant
Itâs like you werenât here
'Cause itâs like
I was living
It's like I was near
