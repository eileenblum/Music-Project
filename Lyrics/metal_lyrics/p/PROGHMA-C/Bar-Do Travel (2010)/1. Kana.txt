Did you send in him to that boy and out with the smoke on my desert
There's no hoodlum in the beginning ???

Simulation!
Simulation!
Simulation!
Simulate!

In the shadow of Godâs arms
And the air in his large rays
Freshman fetish
Pours on, swallows us
Your lips just like a glow, warm, riding away from my fingertips
So man is living prayers

If I could control my river my good photo bluff
Got my favorite schizophrenic hearing preying us
Simplifying myself, cause youâre complicated enough
Thereâs no smell, there is nobody, you are all Iâve got

Kana!

In the shadow of Godâs arms
And the air in his large rays
Freshman fetish
Pours on, swallows us
Your lips just like a glow, warm, riding away with my fingertips
So man is living prayers

Ff I could control my river my good photo bluff
Got my favorite schizophrenic hearing preying us
Simplifying myself, cause youâre complicated enough
Thereâs no smell, there is nobody, you are all Iâve got

Iâm broken!
Remind!
What are!
You!
Broken!
Remind!
What are!
With You!
Broken!
Remind!
What are!
You!
Broken!
Remind!
What are!

You!
