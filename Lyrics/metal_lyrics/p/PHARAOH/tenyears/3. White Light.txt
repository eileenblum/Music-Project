[originally by New Model Army]It's another heroes' sunset
I'm riding on the Great North Road
Coiled and tensed in wonder
As the land turns burning gold

[Chorus:]
Out in the sun, out in the wind
I'm nearly ready now to come back again

We are silent in this worship
Beneath the breathing of the summer trees
They sparkle in a dance of silver
As the light falls through the leaves

[Chorus:]
Out in the sun, out in the wind
I'm nearly ready now to come back again

So from the wisdom of trances, the armies of Jesus
To the Voodoo possessions, the different disguises
At dusk in the mountains, all bowed in surrender
A thousand voices calling out a million names
We knelt as we lit the candles
Around the little shrine
Take me back to the white light
I want to go there again

[Chorus:]
Out in the sun, out in the wind
I'm nearly ready now to come back again
