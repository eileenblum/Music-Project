Lie alone in the shadows
My own company
Always hiding in silence
Melt in misery
Every night is a horror
Days are sickening
Still the distance glimmers
Freedom beckoning

Ten years I lost my life
Ten years in chains
Ten years I dreamed of you
Ten years your name

It's a curse in the making
Sick another year
Yet I'm so far from lifeless
Will I die in here?
In a cage for the ages
Fear entombing me
And it's locked from the inside
Trapped without a key

Ten years I lost my life
Ten years in chains
Ten years I dreamed of you
Ten years your name

Suddenly, like a shockwave
The door is opening
And I walk into darkness
Sick and suffering
Demons hide in the open
Wild and hunting me
An escape to the outside
Laced with tragedy

Ten years you lived my life
Ten years ashamed
Ten years I hated you
Ten years insane
