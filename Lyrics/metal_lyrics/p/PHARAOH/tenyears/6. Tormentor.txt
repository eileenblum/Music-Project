[originally by Slayer]Afraid To Walk The Streets
In The Coldness All Alone
The Blackness Of The Night
Engulfs Your Flesh And Bones
Hoping For Relief
From The Fear You Feel Inside
Losing All Perspective
Of Reality In The Night

Running From Shadows
Blinded By Fear
The Horror Of Nightfall
Is Ever So Near
I Slowly Surround You
As Terror Sets In
Are You Afraid Of The Night

I See The Fright In Your Eyes
As You Turn And Run
But Is Your Mind Playing Tricks
On A Body So Very Young
Feeling As If No One Cares
The Fear Runs Down Your Spine
But I Know I'll Never Rest
Until I Know You're Mine

The Fear Runs Down Your Spine
But I Know I'll Never Rest
Until I Know You're Mine
I Know You're Mine
To Late To Hide
To Late To Save Your Life
