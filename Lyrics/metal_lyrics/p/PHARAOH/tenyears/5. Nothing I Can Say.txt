Some people think about the future as a fantasy
Some see it like a star they could never reach
Just as you reach it, you're watching it die
Some people see the world as if it has to stay like this
I don't think that's anything safe to rely
If you could see tomorrow through my eyes

I see tomorrow
I can see it all too clear
I can see what you are becoming
What I see is what you all should fear

Are you becoming slaves to the system?
Has peace become a fallacy?
Have you all forgotten why you're stranded here
For eternity?

There is nothing I can say
But I'll do what I can do
To help you find the way
Right in front of you

Some people beat the children of this earth to submission
Then lock them up in cages when they make mistakes
They can't learn the truth if you forcefeed them lies

I see tomorrow
I can see it all too clear
I can see what you are becoming
What I see is what you all should fear

You can't afford to be so complacent
You must rehabilitate the world and make it well
Or else you'll have to claim responsibility
For this living hell

There is nothing I can say
But I'll do what I can do
To help you find the way
Right in front of you
