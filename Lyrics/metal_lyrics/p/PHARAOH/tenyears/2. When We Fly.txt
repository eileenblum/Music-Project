Pray the fear of living life is gone
Pray I've the strength to carry on
The hopes and dreams, always harder than they seem
I'm found without a set of wings

I wonder when I'll finally have it all
Then wonder when I'll hit the wall
The cures we should find and the mountains we should climb
I think we'll be alright when we fly, yeah

When I fly the hunt becomes my art
My idle hands, your bleeding heart
The claw ends the fight in the shadows of the night
One inch away to take your life

I seek all powers of the earth below
To gain the strength I've never known
It's a wide open door, we're much different than before
To rule the skies forevermore

The mirror lies with my reflection
Waiting for this new direction
Waiting for some bold reaction from you

Take a step back from the churning
Try to act on what I'm learning
Realize there's only so much we can do

Tired of the superficial goals
So tired, long before I'm old
A crowd may gather round, as you briefly leave the ground
But an eagle's freedom's never found

Pray the scripture's promised land is true
Pray that I have nothing left to lose
The blood and the scars, though we'll never touch the stars
Remember why we've come this far, yeah
