Where to find the words
And who am I to try
When I might not know myself
Yet I owe the advice
So can we live this life
And ignore the unfair
I bid you not things I've gathered
But these thoughts I can share

I just thought you should see what I've seen
To behold and believe
Bring these things a new meaning
Then this song is yours to sing
And reflect in your own light
Your chance to live right
Hard lessons loom in the future
But I'll be by your side

I can weigh what's wrong or right
Done by best to this day
Only fools think they know it all
They don't matter anyway
We'll see you blaze your own trails
I couldn't ask for more
Not always having the answers
But we've been there before
And we've conquered before

I just thought you should see what I've seen
To behold and believe
Bring these things a new meaning
Then this song is yours to sing
And reflect in your own light
Your chance to live right
Hard lessons loom in the future
But I'll be by your side
