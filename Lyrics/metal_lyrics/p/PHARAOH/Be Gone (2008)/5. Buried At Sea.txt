A lonely empire, bound to one
The breadth of gazing wonder, seized firmly
Never to reach out, never known
So hallowed we shall be, when we return to thee

Our whole world and all our needs
Will wash away in time
We conceal the shame
Of helplessness

Where are we now
I can't see through all the smoke and rain
To find the point where death and our lives meet
Some things I'll never know
But I can see we have nowhere to go
I hope that there's a place for you and me
When we're buried at sea

As we go it alone
Unknowingly gone astray
A new tide is turning
It's life that supports life
Is still cause for rage

Our whole world and all our needs
Will wash away in time
We can build walls high and trenches deep
Through we don't transcend
We stalk our crypt alive
Force fed borrowed time

Where are we now
I can't see through all the smoke and rain
To find the point where death and our lives meet
Some things I'll never know
But I can see we have nowhere to go
I hope that there's a place for you and me
When we're buried at sea

Years of sin unspoken
Wounds prove a grave aftermath
An irreversible path
Silent oaths are broken
Harvest a strike in defense
A means to an end

Bring your storms in staunch brigades
Do your worst, we're not afraid

Our whole world and all our needs
Will wash away in time
We can build walls high and trenches deep
Through we don't transcend
We stalk our crypt alive
Force fed borrowed time

Where are we now
I can't see through all the smoke and rain
To find the point where death and our lives meet
Some things I'll never know
But I can see we have nowhere to go
I hope that there's a place for you and me
When we're buried at sea
