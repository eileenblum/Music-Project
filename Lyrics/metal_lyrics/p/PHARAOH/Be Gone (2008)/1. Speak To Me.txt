[Music by Matt Johnsen and Tim Aymar]
[Lyrics by Chris Black]

The sadness of sunrise
Blinded by green in my eyes
I'm lost in a mist of tragedy and pain
A mystery washed in rain

And still I wonder what this means
Lost in dreams, oh can't you see
Can't you speak to me

In tides like the ocean
The waves of my true emotion
I'm always upstream with nothing to hold on
Only my call to you

And still I wonder what this means
Lost in dreams, oh can't you see
Can't you speak to me

As you are near me
Hear me
This loneliness is past filling me
How true
Are you
Your silent presence is killing me

Like mountains in moonlight
Questions rise high to your skies
I'm clouded with doubt that silences my pride
And yet I feel you outside

And still I wonder what this means
Lost in dreams, oh can't you see
Can't you speak to me
