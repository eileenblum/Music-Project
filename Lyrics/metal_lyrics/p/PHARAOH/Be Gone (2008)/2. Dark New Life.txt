Darkness, calling me to rise again
Always midnight and my heart feels right
Sunrise, distant at your journey's end
I'm still flying in this dark new life

Outside, where the light keeps fading
The bell burns high
On this night comes the end of waiting
The world has died

Dark in the daylight tragedy
Killing me
Fly in the midnight majesty
Breaking free

Starlight, guiding my procession
I lock these doors
All mankind, deaf to my confession
These sins are yours

Now it's a moonlight odyssey
Finally
Here watching the earth fade under me
Silently
Gone in the name of one

Darkness, calling me to rise again
Always midnight and my heart feels right
Sunrise, distant at your journey's end
I'm still flying in this dark new life

Who will cry
Who will crawl
Wait 'til that final tower falls
Never mind, as I escape this all

Now it's a moonlight odyssey
Finally
Here watching the earth fade under me
Silently
Now I will know infinity
Spinning me
Saving me
Taking me home

Darkness, calling me to rise again
Always midnight and my heart feels right
Sunrise, distant at your journey's end
I'm still flying in this dark new life
