History beckons them
Dares them to say
They see like none have before
Afraid to enter the fray, they cower

Craven but craving
Cunning and cruel
Committing their charges to war
Fooling their fellows to bring them power

Red honor, promise of fame
Eternal calling
Red honor, hallow your name
Deify the fearless falling

Go bury the dead in glory
No witness to tell their story
Go bury the dead in glory
No witness to tell their story

Ghosts on the battlefield
Search for their graves
They grasp with nothing to say
These shades that died without meaning wander on

Promises broken
Their names are unspoken
Or taken in vain
Their dreams are sold, their tales untold
Their gifted gold an empty token

Red honor, promise of fame
Eternal calling
Red honor, hallow your name
Deify the fearless falling

Go bury the dead in glory
No witness to tell their story
Go bury the dead in glory
No witness to tell their story

Red Honor
Love in glory
Red Honor
Tell your story
