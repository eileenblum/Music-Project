Death in the dirt
A mighty race is starving
Hell in our nation
A thousand dead each daybreak
Famine's fist
It pounds and twists our village
Strong men crawl
Will hunger kill us all

By night they hunt...desperate
At dawn they feast...scavengers

Time running or
The hollow houses blooming
Faith now a falsehood
The only god is sickness
Just one way
To starve alive another day
Dying fed
By harvesting the dead

By night they hunt...desperate
At dawn they feast...scavengers

Save me - Escape this hellbound place
Take me - Beyond this dead grey waste
Safely - After this last disease
Lay me - Where I'll forever rot in peace

Father, if I die overnight
Brother, keep my bones out of sight
Mother, hide me from the damned hordes
Hear me
If I die this way, bury me the whole
Not to be

Dead in the dust
A withered trace of mankind
Hordes in their hunger
The raids are growing constant
No more dead
The scavengers no longer fed
End of life
A famine striking twice

Onward they hunt...desperate
Starving in fear...now traitorous
All life has past...dead and gone
No final feast...no remains

Save me - Escape this hellbound place
Take me - Beyond this dead grey waste
Safely - After this last disease
Lay me - Where I'll forever rot in peace
