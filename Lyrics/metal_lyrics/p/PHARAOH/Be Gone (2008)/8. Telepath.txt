An information haze
A cult of crime in rotten rays
An infrared daze
Lysergic lucid dreams
On channel one
Infect the young
The cult is spun

Telepath, tell me everything

A central system cracks
The system set for self-attack
Etched in black
Hardwired hell for home
A grand design
The perfect crime
Download your mind

As silent voices call to us
Free will is stripped away

And we obey
Afraid to doubt that they say
Our faith is build from the light
And all we trust in our fist sights
Burns right through our eyes

Telepath
Tell me everything
Oh, Telepath
Tell me everything

You've known all along about this
All the world has gone insane
Obstreperous or strident as the words may be
The truth will set us free again

As silent voices call to us
Free will is stripped away

And we obey
Afraid to doubt that they say
Our faith is build from the light
And all we trust in our fist sights
Burns right through our eyes
And we obey
Afraid to doubt that they say
Our faith is build from the light
And all we trust in our fist sights
Burns right through our eyes
