Are you really so naive
Believe the lies you hear
Without so much as wondering
See the world in black and white
Refuse to look between
"You're with us or you're with the enemy"

Reality and fiction
They're both the same in your mind

It's a sickening charade
Pretending what you say
Is something that you know is true
I refuse to be deceived
Your spells don't work on me
I see behind your eyes, there's nothing there

You might see on reflection
That your constant contradiction
Could kill the tune as you

Sing your song (the rats will come along)
Spin your web on and on (until the flies are gone)
Ropes are wound as you
Sing your song (the rats will come along)
Spin your thread 'til its gone (the flies are catching on)

Won't be long...

Forever we are lead astray
Ever blinded to what is true
You liars will face a judgment day
Soon enough we will be coming for you

When the truth has been revealed
And all that you've concealed
Is brought before the world to see
In the face of all your lies
The stones at least will fly
As we who cast them watch you dying

As your feinted conviction
Finally crumbles and falls
For your guilty admission
Voices call as you

Sing your song (the rats will come along)
Spin your web on and on (until the flies are gone)
Ropes are wound as you
Sing your song (the rats will come along)
Spin your thread 'til its gone (the flies are catching on)

Await the break of dawn
But still you spin on and on (until the flies are gone)
Ropes are wound as you
Sing your song (the rats will come along)
Spin your thread 'til its gone (the flies are catching on)
