Lost in the wasteland, losing hope
We carry on
On a mission that we don't understand
We were sent to recover the past
Our quarry's fleeting
Ghosts of failure blind our hands and minds
Submissively marching in line

Thirsty for honor, starved for ideals
Lusting for distant glories
Desperate rulers put their servants to flight
But we do as we're told and we bow
Their guilt's in our hands
So the quest goes on, no treasures in sight
We grope onward in a darker night

Will we make our way back home
Will our courage be exalted
Or damned in dismay
Cover your eyes and pray

Glory and pride
Won't show the way
Who is our light
And our guide
Losing every day

Years have passed and many are lost
Forgotten, unmourned
As they fail so too shall we fail them in turn
Our memory's lost in the wind
The raging storm
Buries bodies, deeds, and all that we learned
This is the prize that we've earned

Will we make our way back home
Will our courage be exalted
Or damned in dismay
Cover your eyes and pray

In the night
Look to the sky
Watch for the lights
Wait for the sign
We'll never see

We hope in our hearts that we can find some way
To bear the decay

Cover your eyes and pray
Cover your eyes and pray
Cover your eyes and pray
