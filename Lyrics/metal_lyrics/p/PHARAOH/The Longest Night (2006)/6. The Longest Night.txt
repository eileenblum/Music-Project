Seven days ago
Came a blast that stole the air we breathe
with fire searing from the sky
The earth was shaking, bells were ringing
Left with nowhere we can hide
All hope was crushed by the first of God
Forget the promises we made
We can't get go, though everything is gone

We were the brave, we were alive
Until we endured the longest night
Now we're enslaved, we've lost our minds
We fell victim to the longest night
And now we're no more

Now night can never turn to day
The stars left darkness in their wake
This broken shadow of a world
Is not the life we knew
Can you believe me?

We were the brave, we were alive
Until we endured the longest night
Now we're enslaved, we've lost our minds
We fell victim to the longest night
And now we're no more

We were the brave, we were alive
Until we endured the longest night
Now we're enslaved, we've lost our minds
We fell victim to the longest night
And now we're no more
