The hollow harvest
A generations plow
Will never be missed
They reap their fruits in hell

Or on a slave ship
It would be just as well
Our shaking death grip
It tightens still

As we break and burn, we'll never learn
We've wasted all these years
We fight and die to drown the lies
That echo in our ears

In tears or chains
You never dreamed of this
An insane mind game
Although it must be true

For all that you've done
And all that's done to you
You never did run
And when you do

For a sin, for a shame, we recite the names
Awakened from our trance
For down below, you'll never know
If you had stood a chance

We're fighting by the dawn
We're fighting after sunrise
We fighting for a chance to see our life to be
And you won't take us alive

We're fighting in the dark
We're fighting after midnight
We're fighting for a fantasy reality
In case our dreams are right

On we fight!

Forever fighting by the dawn
We're fighting after sunrise
We fighting for a chance to see our life to be
And you won't take us alive

We're fighting in the dark
We're fighting after midnight
We're fighting for a fantasy reality
In case our dreams are right
