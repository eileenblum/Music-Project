Forged in the fire, but cold as ice
I will spare no sacrifice
You'll pay with tears shed in mortal fright
All shall fear the hammer's strike

Nailed to this war that will never end
Death inspires those whom I defend
Your pounding heart thrusting like a knife
Eyes wide with hate as you come into sight

As you're losing your way in the night
Finding you've run out of life
Lay your soul on the anvil I strike
'Cause I am the hammer!

As you're losing your way in the night
Finding you've run out of life
death will drive through your head like a spike
'Cause I am the hammer!

Black bombshells fly and swordsmen clash
Rockets blaze and muzzles flash
Now soldiers shake and cowards cry
So dig the graves by the dawn's early light

As you're losing your way in the night
Finding you've run out of life
Lay your soul on the anvil I strike
'Cause I am the hammer!
