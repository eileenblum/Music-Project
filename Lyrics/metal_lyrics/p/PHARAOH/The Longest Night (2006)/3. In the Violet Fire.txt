In the darkness envision
Angels protect you from sin
In your heart there's a key to the prison within

In the violet fire
Wash away your fears
Let it shine forever
Holy light for the world to see

Tears of joy like a river
Finally touching the sea
Unified by the flame we together are free

In the violet fire
Wash away your fears
Let it shine forever
Feel it flow from your heart over me

Generations of anguish and pain
Oblivious to the power of the flame
Derision casting a shadow on the path to life

From the fire
Violet Fire
Heaven's Desire

In the violet fire
Wash away your fears
Let it shine forever
Feel it flow from your heart eternally

In the violet fire
Wash away your fears
Let it shine forever
Feel it flow from your heart to me
