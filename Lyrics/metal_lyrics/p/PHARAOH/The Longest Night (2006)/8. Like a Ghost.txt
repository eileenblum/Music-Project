I was blind to the sins of a time forsaken
When love inflicted misery
So long ago her face was a dim reflection
So many frozen memories

Now they haunt my soul
Like a ghost of love

And I fear that she's come to reclaim her power
Take possession of my dreams
And steal away my sanity by the hour
Evanesce reality

Spinning lies of gold
Oh, she haunts my soul

Like a ghost of love
A curse I can't undo
I hear a siren's voice
A song of love so true

Keep the ring I gave to thee
You broke the promise so selfishly
It was an unexpected tragedy
Life goes on and on and on without you

Like a ghost of love

Like a ghost of love
A curse I can't undo
I hear a siren's voice
A song of love so true

Fear that she's come to reclaim her power
Take possession of my dreams
And steal away my sanity by the hour
Evanesce reality

Like a ghost of love
