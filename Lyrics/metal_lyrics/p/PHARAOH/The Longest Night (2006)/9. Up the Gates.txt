When the banners were called, we had raised a mighty cheer
Our forces had seemed so strong
In the time that's passed, we have seen what we lost
Our lives have been hard so long

Now the conquerors have come tonight-
Do we fold or do we fight?
Is the kingdom still worth fighting for?
Up the gates! and let them in!

So the siege is on, we hunger and we quake in fear
Not just soldiers fight the war
Will we die in here? We're all afraid and can't recall
The cause that we're starving for

Now the conquerors have come tonight-
Do we fold or do we fight?
Is the kingdom still worth fighting for?
Up the gates! and let them in!

Though we pray to be relieved, our prayers are never heard
Prayers are never heard
Though we're promised that we're safe, they lie with every word
Lie with every word

When the banners were called, no one thought to doubt the cause
Our leaders had seemed so strong
Now we wait and hope and wonder were we right or wrong
We'll only survive so long

Now the conquerors have come tonight-
Do we fold or do we fight?
Is the kingdom still worth fighting for?
Up the gates! and let them in!

Up the gates!
