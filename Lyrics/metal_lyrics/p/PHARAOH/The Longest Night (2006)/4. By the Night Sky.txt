Deep within the desert
One race of mortal men
The gods have given to us
A rich and fertile land

Adorned with greatest splendor
The dawning of a time
Where all men pledge their honor
And some pay with their lives

We are a people like none were before
A civilization that demanded more
A craftsman by trade, I've seen it all start
From floods of the Nile to the beauties of art

The voices of heroes cry out from the sands
Their spirits call out to me, I hear them call to me

Drive on, guided by the night sky
As in the heavens shall now be on Earth
We go on guided by the night sky
Stone by stone we prepare for rebirth of the king

Divine revelation, a king and his pride
To build such a tower to reach the sky
His guidance is crucial, we must heed the call
For the strong can build many, but the dead none at all

They say that our destiny's drawn in the stars
It's all so clear to me, everything's clear to me

Drive on, guided by the night sky
As in the heavens shall now be on Earth
We go on guided by the night sky
Stone by stone we prepare for rebirth of the king

Oh, twenty years have come and gone
Thousands, they did what can't be done
They gave their lives, their sweat and blood

So, born is a gateway to the sky
A passage to meet with the light
To reap the fruits of the afterlife

To the king we give this symbol of our loyalty
For when he will descend amongst the gods
And in the end he'll give us immortality
For we have kept the faith and we are strong

The tomb of the pharaoh, a well hidden vault
Safe from the tides, within thick walls
Stacked well with fortunes and lined with respect
Preserved there for ages, for the life that comes next

The quest of the Pharaohs, they walk with the sun
For this we gave everything, we've given everything

Drive on, guided by the night sky
As in the heavens shall now be on Earth
We go on guided by the night sky
There'll come a time when we will live again

Drive on, guided by the night sky
As in the heavens shall now be on Earth
We go on guided by the night sky
Stone by stone we prepare for rebirth of the king
