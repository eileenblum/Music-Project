The way you betrayed me is unspeakable
Although it comes as no surprise
Cause anyone who's ever owned my loyalty
Repaid me with insanity
And still you cry about your misery
The way you always

Tell your tale like you're a refugee
You lies intentional and cold
And if you found a way, the perfect way to finish me
And free my tortured soul
What reason would it hold?

All I ever wanted was to know a feeling less than sorrow

But endlessly, so many worlds apart still I fight the pain
That endlessly and always in my heart has to live so endlessly

I'll never surrender to the treachery
The soulless beast behind your eyes
I once mistook or overlooked your vanity
My heart's no longer blind
If it takes the rest of time

I will wait forever and a day
watching you wish there's no tomorrow

But endlessly, so many worlds apart still I fight the pain
That endlessly and always in my heart has to live so endlessly

Tell your tale like you're a refugee
You lies intentional and cold
And if you found a way, the perfect way to finish me
And free my tortured soul
What reason would it hold?

All I ever wanted was to know a feeling less than sorrow

But endlessly, so many worlds apart still I fight the pain
That endlessly and always in my heart has to live so endlessly

Endless guilt and pain
Endless walks in the rain
Endless tragedy
Endless, endlessly...
