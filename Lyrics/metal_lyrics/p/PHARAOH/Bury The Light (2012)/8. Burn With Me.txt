Wonât be dark tonight
A great despair, we know why
Some say itâs alright
But we all know, thatâs a lie

I fear the day thatâs coming
Bring back the night to me
Yeah

Voices from the crowd
Said burn the earth, itâs allowed
Chaos coming now
And we all know, it wonât go out

I fear for all tomorrow
Donât need the sun to see
A world in sleepless sorrow
In flames eternally

Burn with me
By my light, you will see
Burn with me
Paradise will never be
And now in the twilight
I see the smoke rise

Burn with me
By my light, you will see
Burn with me
Paradise will never be
Outside in the twilight
I see the smoke rise

Oh, in fires in the distance
Our sadness glowing
Burning on
Burning on
