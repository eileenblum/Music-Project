An earthen melody
Enchants my ears
An evening symphony of tears hanging in the sky
I dream of better years
A distant sun
I watch the rain and wonder whether you and I can ever

Hope to find that way again
Hope to walk that road together
It could take forever
Wait for all the tears to end

Cry
For what we could have been
Could have that chance again
We wonât know how it ends without one more try
Cry

Before we fade
We turn to grey
Remember why we turned away
Is it too late?
Before we die
You and I
Open wide our eyes
Ready for another day to cry

An echoed memory
Returns to me
A voice is speaking from the river ever flowing by
It washes out my heart
And leaves me cold
I mourn for all the days of old and I wonder can we

Hope to find that way again
Hope to walk that road together
I could wait forever
Counting on the tears to end

Cry
For what we could have been
Could have that chance again
We wonât know how it ends without one more try
Cry

Cry
For what we could have been
This might be the end
At least I found a friend not afraid to cry
Cry
