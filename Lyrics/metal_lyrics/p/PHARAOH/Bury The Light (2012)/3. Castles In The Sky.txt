Hearts gone deaf to the cries
Ringing the death toll of freedom
Blind to pain in our eyes
Marching our way to the Colosseum
They grace a roaring applause
Masking out the voice of reason
Generations have suffered the cause
Justifying castles in the sky

Fortifying Castles In The Sky
Certifying heroes as they die
Why?

Behind a fortress of stone
Towering over the masses
The king looks after his own
Feeding and filling their privileged glasses
They drink the blood of our dead
From a sea of deep denial
Hold your tongue or he'll hand you your head
Pay your tax or get the axe
Respect the castles in the sky

Walls defending castles in the sky
Reprehending castles in the sky
Condescending castles in the sky
Rainbows ending castles in the sky

Far above
Calling us
Peace will come
Everything you're dreaming of
Like a dove
Soon enough
Leave the world to suffer

But why?

Walls defending castles in the sky
Reprehending castles in the sky
Condescending castles in the sky
Rainbows ending castles in the sky
The sky

For them, we die
