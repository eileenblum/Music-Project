Waning strength feels always more eminent
To those it fails
The mighty, still falling, so muster their armies
And set the sails

In the burning twilight glow
Canât you see your sun goes down for you?

Look with pity on people less powerful
See them cowered in fear
Say youâve come to redeem them, but still they donât know
Just why youâre here

In the empty starless black
Donât you know your sun is never coming back

The graveyard of empires is calling you
Calling you, itâs calling you
Itâs calling you to conquer
The graveyard of empires is calling you
But will you live to see it through?

Over mountains,
Over deserts and over the fields
Crossed the oceans
Crossed the heavens and still no one yields to you

Days and months and years turn to decades
What power you had left is rapidly fading
Alive in the tomb are you laid

âSave us! Save us!
The savage betrayed us!
Save us! Save us!
Weâre too great to die,â you pray
For the red of the day

Topple mountains
Clear the deserts
Burn the fields
They still wonât bow to you

Grab your chest, and clutch at the gaping wound
Your bloody shame
Your body will rot with the others before you
It ends the same

At the blinding break of dawn
In the foreign sun you pass forever on

The graveyard of empires is calling you
Calling you, itâs calling you
Itâs calling you to conquer
The graveyard of empires is calling you
But no one lives to see it through
