Call her your queen
And lay a bed of roses at her feet
Court the obscene
And lay with the swine

Her pledges and promises
Naked lies that beg your own decline
See no wrong in this
You're drunk on her venomous wine
Poison fills your cup
And when your mouth starts to foam
You trust that you're rightly riled
Frothing bile

Yank the leash, command it to comply
The Wolves are coming
Raise the whip and dare it to defy
The Wolves are coming
You thought you raised a dog, and wonder why
The wolf has bloodlust in his eyes
Youâre the trembling prey
Wolves will not obey

Slave in the mines
And praise your mastersâ magnanimity
Die for his diamonds
And groan for his gold

Unguarded and tame
Broken by the hypnotizing hold
Think you're high from the flames
But you're feverish out in the cold
Your life is cheaply sold
And then when the coal runs out
And the mountains are stripped and bare
Where's your share?

Yank the leash, command it to comply
The Wolves are coming
Raise the whip and dare it to defy
The Wolves are coming
You thought you raised a dog, and wonder why
The wolf has bloodlust in his eyes
Youâre the trembling prey
Wolves will not obey

Hacking and lame
Deny yourself the wanted medicine
The mark in a game
That you think you control
Wager with your soul
And so you howl with the wolves
But the scent on the wind is yours
The bloody track is yours

Yank the leash, command it to comply
The Wolves are coming
Raise the whip and dare it to defy
The Wolves are coming
You thought you raised a dog, and wonder why
The wolf has bloodlust in his eyes
Youâre the trembling prey
Wolves will not obey
