Break your back, all the action
Takes your breath away
Grind the gears, after years, itâs
Just another day
A wicked lie told coldly by
Dead voices in the sky
Says you should just obey because they
Own you âtil you die

They donât want you to know
They think that you donât know
Itâs an illusion of control

Oh-oh-oh
Only you decide the time is right to
Go-oh-oh
Make a difference to the world around you
No-oh-oh
Donât let the devils in the sky deceive you
Oh-oh-oh
You have the power now
In your hands

So hereâs the plan

Trip the switch, trick the system
Snipe it from inside
This mad machineâs worst enemy
Could be itself tonight
Right behind your tired eyes
Your spirit is the spark
Blast the light, let loose the lightning
Show them youâre in charge!

They donât want you to know
They think that you donât want to know
That you decide what they control

Oh-oh-oh
Only you decide the time is right to
Go-oh-oh
Make a difference to the world around you
No-oh-oh
Donât let the devils in the sky deceive you
Oh-oh-oh
You have the power now
In your hands

Under the circuitry humming
Rings a warning of shame
Soon an unholy cavalryâs coming
Waiting, waiting
You reexamine the riddle
No, itâs never too late
Realize the solution is simple
By your hands escape

Oh-oh-oh
Only you decide the time is right to
Go-oh-oh
Make a difference to the world around you
No-oh-oh
Donât let the devils in the sky deceive you
Oh-oh-oh
You have the power now
In your hands
