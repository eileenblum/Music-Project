Endless
Like infinity
A still and starry sea
Leading to a lifeless galaxy
Washes over me
When suddenly I see
That this is not a sleepless fantasy

By the coming light
Leave me here to dream tonight

The flashing in my eyes
Is darkness in disguise
I start to see my life go racing by
Voices from inside
Say fight from where you lie
Donât let it be your guide right out of life

By the coming light
Leave me here to dream

No, not tonight
No, no, no, not tonight
Leave me here to dream
Tonight

You false light
Hear me well
Iâll send you back to hell

Darkness
Dims the light away
Silently it fades
To flash before another sleepless face
So the night is saved
I defeated fate
I drift away in waves toward the day

I sent the light away
Leave me here to dream

No, not tonight
No, no, no, not tonight
I would never dream
Of the light
