Under the mountain
Inside the eye
The ashes of dreaming
The reason to lie

Heretic! Traitor!

Inside the armor
Trapped under ice
A stranger among us
My only choice

Heretic! Traitor!
Derelict! Infidel!

In a flash of the dark
I'm finding my wisdom is gone
It's a fight for my life
I don't know which side I am on

Sucking the venom
Twisting the knife
Losing all purpose
Failure for life

Heretic! Traitor!
Derelict! Infidel!

In a flash of the dark
I'm finding my wisdom is gone
It's a fight for my life
I don't know which side I am on
