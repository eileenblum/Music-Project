Inside me barely beats
A heart that's poisoned through
Filled with this death disease
No chances left to lose
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger for a time
But it will get you down the line

Outside in the street tonight,
They're fighting with the law
Outside in the street tonight,
They're fighting for control
The enemy, the rebel sect,
The bastard breed amok
Where you see a casualty
I see a stroke of luck

The bleeding of my hands and
The snapping of your ribs
Broke hearts are mine
The profit of your death is my life going on
Your fight ends just in time

Underneath the street tonight,
They're ripping at the bone
Underneath the street tonight
They're ripping parts unknown
A beating heart, a life goes on,
You're almost a friend
They will take your life and then
I'll take it once again

The bleeding of my hands and
The snapping of your ribs
Broke hearts are mine
The profit of your death is my life going on
Your fight ends just in time

Beating in my chest tonight
The heart of fallen foe
Beating in my chest tonight,
A heart I'll never know
Treachery, the evil eye
Behind my father's back
Knife in hand, swooping blade
Broken heart attacks

The bleeding of my hands and
The snapping of your ribs
Broke hearts are mine
The profit of your death is my life going on
Your fight ends just in time
