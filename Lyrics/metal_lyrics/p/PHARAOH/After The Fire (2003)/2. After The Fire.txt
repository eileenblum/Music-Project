And then the war was done,
All the dead were one,
I found my eyes and
They were useless in the sun.
And with a blade I found,
I cut a mountain down,
I built a house where all
The flames had touched the ground.

Then all the stars fell from the sky;
All lost at sea, the shipmen cry:
Without the help of constellations in the night
We're forced to fly by our own light.

And when the sons have killed their fathers,
And when the census of the dead is given up,
And when the fire starts returning to the sun
I take my place among the one.

I've lost the world now,
My heart is blind somehow.
Every night I hear a crying in the wind.
The ghost of soldiers dead,
The ghost inside my head,
Even ghosts of enemies begin to sound like friends

Then all the stars fell from the sky;
All lost at sea, the shipmen cry:
Without the help of constellations in the night
We're forced to fly by our own light.

And when the sons have killed their fathers' fathers,
And when the census of the dead is given up,
And when the fire starts returning to the sun
I take my place among the one.

After the fire
After the flight
It's time to forget everything that you're thinking is right

The fire burned alive,
It's ashes filled my eyes,
It's cinders left a hopeless hunger in my bones
And some I've never known
Their bodies paving stone,
And I am left to walk an earth I call my own

Then all the stars fell from the sky;
All lost at sea, the shipmen cry:
Without the help of constellations in the night
We're forced to fly by our own light.

And when the sons have killed themselves,
And when the census of the dead is given up,
And when the fire starts returning to the sun
I take my place among the one.
