Dawn closes in without mercy and my boy is here
I'll be the one to damn us both if pride is a sin
Flying on wings of faith, dying on wings of fear
No more leashes, cut the cord - no more reeling him in

Shooting star of my own flesh and blood
A comet on wings of pride
Failure flying, falling from the sky
But look at that boy try

I've told him my failures and given him all of my grief
But now it's time that he should learn from his own mistakes
To be empowered or betrayed by his own belief
I admire his faith, his strength, and the risks that he takes

Shooting star of my own flesh and blood
A comet on wings of pride
Failure flying, falling from the sky
But look at that boy fly

Shooting star of my own flesh and blood
A comet on wings of pride
Failure flying, falling from the sky
But look at that boy die
