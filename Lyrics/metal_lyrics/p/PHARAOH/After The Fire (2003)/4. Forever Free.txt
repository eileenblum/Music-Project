This pain in my head, this anger in my heart
It is for you, my friend
The tears ever flow a river of disdain
So unfailingly flowing to the end

Oh - Beyond the other side of sanity
A thousand dreams away
Oh - close your eyes and everything you see
Will come to be reality
Forever free

Oh - Can I believe in what could be un-true, enough to make it right?
Oh - Would the truth surrender if I fight, no longer be reality?
I pray it comes peacefully and sets you free for all eternity
Forever free

Inside I'm dying just the same
I'm suffering to see you in this pain
Just close your eyes and say goodbye

The song of my soul will never sound the same
Until we meet again
The tears ever flow a river of disdain
So unfailingly flowing to the end

Oh - Beyond the other side of sanity
A thousand dreams away
Oh - close your eyes and everything you see
Will come to be reality
Forever free

I pray it comes peacefully and sets you free for all eternity
Forever free
