They are lost to the mythic haze,
Those retreating and distant days
When the eye could observe your ways
And our memories were made,
But those memories fade.

Precious seconds are squandered like rain on sand
But how can we know when it ends?

Never, not again. No!
Never, not again. No.

Though the ghost maybe lingers on,
Chased in visions before the dawn
From the light you're forever gone,
And too soon it will seem
Like your days disappear in a dream

Too much living is given to grief and pain
When too much forgiveness remains

Never, not again. No!
Never, not again. No.
