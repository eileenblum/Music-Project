To sail the waves of the ocean
Across the sea of life
Chasing the wind of freedom
And reaching into the light
Dreaming all I can dream
Feeding my hungry eyes
Unafraid of the future
Aware in a world of lies

There's no place for pain and tears
Feeling like the end is drawing nearer
It's so clear
Everything to think is true might just be
The things that cloud your view

While the earth is turning
As the stars align
Now is the time

Every moment that you choose
Not to take is one more time you lose
Time can't wait around for you
It's too late tomorrow's overdue

While the sun is burning
Life is on the line
Now is the time

To say the words we all live to hear
The time to reach for things we long to be near
The time for facing things we don't want to fear
The time to tell you now is here

To feel the flame of devotion
Inhale the smoke of peace
Holding a breath of silence
Regaining your sanity

Free - the answer is always the same
Free - There's only one truth to proclaim
Free - Relax and let go of your fear
Free - Your soul is the sound that you'll hear

To sail the waves of the ocean
Across the sea of life
Chasing the wind of freedom
And reaching into the light
Dreaming all I can dream
Feeding my hungry eyes
Unafraid of the future
Aware in a world of lies

There's no place for pain and tears
Feeling like the end is drawing nearer
It's so clear
Everything to think is true might just be
The things that cloud your view

While the sun is burning
Life is on the line
Now is the time

To say the words we all live to hear
The time to reach for things we long to be near
The time for facing things we don't want to fear
The time to tell you now is here
