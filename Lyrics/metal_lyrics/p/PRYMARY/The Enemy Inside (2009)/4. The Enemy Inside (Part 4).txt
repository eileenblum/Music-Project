Don't tell me this dream is over
Because I've only just begun
Don't tell me this is all just a phase
Because I don't think my heart could stand the break
Something dark inside of me
Can turn success to misery

I'm the maker of my own demise
And I hate what I see in these eyes
But when things get too close I run and hide
And all of my hopes and dreams just die

Don't say that my time has come and gone
Because my moment has just arrived
So many people I have wronged
But I'm ready to make a deal
Something dark inside of me
Can turn success to misery

I'm the maker of my own demise
And I hate what I see in these eyes
But when things get too close I run and hide
And all of my hopes and dreams just die
