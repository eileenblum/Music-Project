Am I everything that you wanted me to be?
I am everything that you filtered into me
I kept everything harbored deep inside of me
I lost everything of my humanity

Holding on to the part of me that's left in me
Holding on to the shred of empathy that lays inside of me

I am walking the line
I can't contain the rage inside of me that's breaking
And I won't deny
The hate I feel for all the happiness you have

All the paths in life that you could have taken
And fate smiled down on me and led you to my door
And though your sacrifice would serve to be my first
I could not shake the thrill of taking

One moment to slip inside your skin
And watch the flicker in your eyes grow dim
One moment to take away your pain
And I can go on with the day

Holding on to the part of me that's left in me
Holding on to the shred of empathy that lays inside of me

I am walking the line
I can't contain the rage inside of me that's breaking
And I won't deny
I'm on the road to the edge of discovery

Holding on to the part of me that's left in me
Holding on to the shred of empathy that lays inside of me

I am walking the line
I can't contain the rage inside of me that's breaking
And I won't deny
The hate I feel for all the happiness you have

I am walking the line
I can't contain the rage inside of me that's breaking
And I won't deny
I'm on the road to the edge of discovery
