Raging against the light
A rebel without a cause
A product of your life
Fueling the war inside
Fighting to gain control
A world of your design
You'll bring the whole damn thing down
As you crash and burn

There was once a time
The magic filled our minds
Ambition and the drive
Eclipsed the pitfalls of our lives
But now you're on your own
You're reaching out your flailing hand
Trying to gain connection
But you left us all behind

I can feel us fading
I'm left cold and jaded
I can't stop this feeling
War control in my mind

Everything you had
Everything you craved
Is slipping through your hands
A failing power play

I will not forget
All the fear and all the hate
I will not forgive
The pain that you inflicted
I will not submit
And be the one you subjugate
I will not forgive
The pain that you inflicted

I can feel us fading
I'm left cold and jaded
I can't stop this feeling
War control in my mind
