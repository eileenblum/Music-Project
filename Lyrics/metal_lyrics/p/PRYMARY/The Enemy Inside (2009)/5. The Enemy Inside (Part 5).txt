I'm the maker of my own demise

And now I find myself
On the precipice of a broken dream
Staring at the void that stares back at me
It penetrates me

Deep in myself there's a hole inside
from this shattered life
Deep in myself where the shadows fight
and eclipse the light
Deep in myself I can reason out
any fear or doubt
Deep in myself I can trivialize
what they feel inside now
