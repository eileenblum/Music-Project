Claw marks on the tanglebox
The only sign I gave a fight
And even though my heart is racing
I wonder if I'm still alive

This empty shell was once a man
Filled with hunger and drive
Wrapped up in self denial
With wounded pride where the hatred thrived

Now I find myself
On the precipice of a broken dream
Staring at the void that stares back at me
It penetrates me

Deep in myself there's a hole inside
from this shattered life
Deep in myself where the shadows fight
and eclipse the light

Hurt by the trace of an old memory
Old delusions reveal false realities
Cut from a semblance of real happiness
Falling deeper still from my humanity
Crossing the fine line to complacency
All of my hopes and dreams fall around me
It's all just so easy to give in to doubt
And the choices here could mean everything

Deep in myself there's a hole inside
from this shattered life
Deep in myself where the shadows fight
and eclipse the light
Deep in myself I can reason out
any fear or doubt
Deep in myself I can trivialize
what they feel inside now

Whatever happened to the way things used to be?
When the days of my youth were ahead of me
Somewhere along the way they lost their view of the finish
And the choices mean everything
Somewhere along the way is a place called hopefulness
That only exists in my mind
