Darkness is falling
The well's run dry
The fat cats are fleeing
All the mess behind
Utopian vision
Where sense was denied
Dystopian legacy
The folly of their pride

Led like sheep to the slaughter
They flock now with eyes wide open
Drawn like a moth to the flame
Who happily waits to get burned

Deepen the need
The sheep will follow you
Deepen the need
Preach to the masses
Deepen the need
Create dividing lines
Deepen the need
Now you rule them too

Break down the lines
And see the signs
To see the coming
Of the day
To testify
This way of life
With open heart
And open mind

Dogs on the run from the master
Nurtured under sheltered skies
Fat from the rules of deception
Depicted as free enterprise

I will try to make my way
Through this constant disillusion
I will try to find my place
In this constant evolution
I will swallow my pride
And live my life
To make my hopes and dreams
Come true
