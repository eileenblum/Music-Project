[I. Euthanasia]

My dilemma stands
The pieces of the puzzle don't fit
And I find myself alone
My body's compromised on this
Just one more statistic
My mind is waging war
But I'm losing everyday

This fashioned lie
"You can live a long life"
Is served up cold
Leaves me empty and old
I remember when
The two of us were one
But you left me
A very long time ago

With the barrel to my head
Enlightened state of mind
To pull the trigger now
Would wash away this life
To go a coward's way
Is not the way for me
Keeping in my pain
And living life for you

This charmed life I lead
Has finally found its end
The love we shared
Took a lifetime to build
And as days go by
You'll forget my name
You be the phantom
And I'll wither away

Searching for answers
To the questions we find
Caging the abstracts we define
I'm still stuck here
Making sense of this senseless useless
Trapped by the limits of my mind

[II. The Genius of Man]

On the other side
This genius turned to madman
Sings a song of dementia
With moments of lucidity

Wrapped in his world
Of formulas, equations
Solving the mysteries of life
Faltering reasons of insanity

Once he held greatness in the palm of his hand
Once he was famous beyond other man
Once he touched heaven, intellect he defied
Once felt elation at wonders he could find

And through his life the pain of stress kept on building
The voices that would not subside
So it came as no surprise after all this
That his mind would choose to fly
So far from where we've come to where we going
So far yet so alone
I remember when the two of us were one
But he left so long ago...

[III. Altruism]

Feeling small and alone
When you're right here next to me
Cause the distance between us
Is stretching into forever
Head is in the zone
Or is it all overblown?
Like some spoiled child who wants it all
Who needs it all

Is it my right to feel this way?
Why can't I see through this haze?
This is the part I have to play
But tonight I'm in a daze
I'm in a daze

I'll suppress the urge to scream
And withdraw into myself
I will spare you all my demons
As I quietly waste away
To slowly watch you fade
Can't help but break my heart
But the fact that I lay dying
Won't register at all, won't register at all

Is it my right to feel this way?
Why can't I see through this haze?
This is the part I have to play
But tonight I'm in a daze,
I'm in a daze

45 years until death do we part
I will take your pain and make it my own
But I'll fear the day that you look in my eyes
And see a face that you hardly recognize
So feel free to fly to your heart's content
But know that I will always hold on
But don't you resent my reluctance
To follow in your footsteps

[IV. The Great Equalizer]

Losing out
To the part of me that's taking me
Losing out
On the shred of empathy that lays inside of me

I am walking the line
I can't contain the rage inside of me that's breaking
And I won't deny
I'm on the road to the edge of discovery

I will take away your pain
All your numbness and your rage
I will sever all your bonds
Release you of your chains
I will cut out all the black
With the scissors in your drawer
I will take away your voice
As I take away your life

What once was two is now one
All alone in his insanity
What once was two is now gone
But he left this place so long ago
All the guilt and all the pain
Is slowly washed away in blood
When the roles have all been played
The stage is set for the final curtain call...

Searching for answers
To the questions that we find
Caging the abstracts we define within our minds
I'm still stuck here
Making sense of all this senseless useless
Trapped by the limits of my mind
So far from where we've come to where we are going
So far yet so far alone
I remember when the two of us were one
But he left so long ago...
