Do you close you eyes
Afraid to see the things inside
Afraid to face your fear
And face the promise of a new day
But deep inside your strength lies
To challenge the fear that is up ahead
To bring about your deliverance
and face the promise of a new day

And there you stood the victim
Young and lost and broken
And you swore you'd never
Play this part again
You took the role as master
Reaching to grab the reins
Turned your head away and tucked away the pain

Living death
Living life
Living guilt
Living pain
Keeping hope
Keeping faith
Living for the promises made

Test the water
Find the strength within you
Find the light child
Know that your heart will lead true
Be the living
Know that your view is truth
Know the mindset
To see the love that is you

And there you stood the victim
Young and lost and broken
And you swore you'd never
Play this part again
You took the role as master
Reaching to grab the reins
Turned your head away and tucked away the pain

Living death
Living life
Living guilt
Living pain
Keeping hope
Keeping faith
Living for the promises made
