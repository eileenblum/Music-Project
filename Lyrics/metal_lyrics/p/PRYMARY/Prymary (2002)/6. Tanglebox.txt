I was young
And my mind was an open book
And the stars
Were at an arm's length reach
I saw the world
Through wondering eyes
And the dream
Was still in my sights

Along the way
I lost the view of the finish
And you
Turned a blind eye towards me
I opened my eyes for the first time
And saw a world of greed
And the man just smiled and said
Welcome to the real world
Now that I'm older
I see the toll of life's follies
But the consolation is minimal
I searched out the night sky
Struggling for the reasons why
Help me I've fallen too deep

Down the... spiral into the tanglebox
Feelings... whirling betrayal in your mind
Twisting... turning into the tanglebox
Truths are... twisted the form is broken

Caught in a cage of lies
Integrity is put to die
It's easier if I just give in
And the choice
Could mean everything
My will has sunk beneath the floor
Honesty flies out the door
The tanglebox has swallowed me alive
And the climb
Is a long way to the top

Down the... spiral into the tanglebox
Feelings... whirling betrayal in your mind
Twisting... turning into the tanglebox
Truths are... twisted the form is broken
