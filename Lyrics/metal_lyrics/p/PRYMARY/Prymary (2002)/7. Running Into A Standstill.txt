Dreams slowly fade away
My secrets... Fade away...
Disquiet memories fill my soul, not ready to be tamed
It's instinct to run from the pain but we run into a standstill

Pain fills my cell
Each tear has a story to tell
Fire burning does not consume
Ghost of time that passed too soon
Watching the replay through my eyes
Is playing havoc in my mind

Echoes of past
Echoes of fears
Have sent me to run into a standstill
Echoed secrets
Silent years
Have lead me to run into a standstill

Smiles that slowly melt away
Tearstains gently map the way
Storm of thunder inside my head
Thoughts so easily misread

Razor cuts wounding my soul
Broken hearts never bleed you know
Lines appearing on my face
Drawn from years I can't erase

Arms outstretched as I am searching for you
Blinded by life but I'm looking for you
Searching wildly for escape
From the pain I've had to take
Shadowed nightmares
Waking Dreams
Programmed laughter
Silent Screams

All that I've seen
Is nothing new to me
The story's all the same
Life's an endless game
Life within the past
Is numbing me of feeling
While every day is fleeting
And love is so concealing
Courage spent to face the day
Leading me to find the way
Knowing now who I was
To find out who I am
Taking steps from my pain
And I know there will come a day
When I can face the past
To find my way at last

Light eclipse the night
Knowledge give me strength
To carry on this weight
And bring me to the day

I feel the tide is turning...
A river can change course
I can cease running to a standstill

Dreams that slowly drift away
Secret longings melt that into the day
Hindsight has found that I've chosen the path of most resistance
But with persistence that path has changed it's course
