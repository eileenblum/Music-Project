A brief distraction
Object of my attention
To see what I know
To know what I see
Use your imagination
Analyze your reaction
Difference in interpretation
What are you seeing?
Fascination
with the creation
of a way of life
or a train of thought

Society's promises
Images and dreams
Telling lies
With honest eyes
Communicate the thought
Express the idea
Don't ask for acceptance
Put it into motion
Roads of interaction
Paths of connection
Lies and truth
Showing the proof
That this world's a point of view

Choosing my sights
I can see the light
But shadows of darkness surround me
I can walk alone
or to the beat of another
The universal's elusive
Truth can never be revealed
Because it's all a point of view

We can live by opinion
If we find common ground
We can make the decision
If we find common ground
