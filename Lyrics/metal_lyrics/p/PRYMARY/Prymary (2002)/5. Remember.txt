I held her hand the night she died
She's another thing I now have no more
The most important part of me
Has now become a fading memory
What will become of me?
I'm left here all alone
No one to help me
No place to call a home
My soul is tired from all
The tears that I have cried
Faith in what we believe
Will keep our dream alive

I walk the streets alone in fear
Afraid that I will never love again
She was the only thing I had
And now I've lost my only love, my only friend
But hope is still inside
I know I must go on
Nothing can change the fact
That what I have is gone
I will remember
As long as I will live
All of the happiness
She left behind to give

And when the sadness fills the day
I will be confident to know
That I can still picture her face
And it will stay with me forever
