Why do you send me?
Away from my fears
A heart of emptiness
A river full of tears
I'm not afraid to face
The challenges before me
After all I've seen
How could I forget?

But I look into the future
Trying to change the past's remains
I'll fight 'till my last breath is gone
At times I feel I've won
But I keep coming back to surrender
It's welcome

Somewhere there's an alliance
Between you and I
But through who's doors are open
To understand each side
The thoughts that I endure
Are not thoughts
Pages with the story
Of my life

But I look into the future
Trying to change the past's remains
I look around at my new world
I once was bound
To fear and hate
But it's all behind me now

I see myself
Tearing through weakness
As I stand alone
On my way to change
I'll prove to you
That it's not impossible
Life has just begun
I open up my eyes
