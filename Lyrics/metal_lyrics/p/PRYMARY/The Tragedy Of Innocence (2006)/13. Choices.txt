Awakened from the light
In more ways than one
Wheels in wheels in motion
Directing the course of my life
The haze of disillusion
The misery of fear
The sense it's all so senseless
The sum of my whole life

Am I the product of another's wickedness?
Am I the sum of all my crimes?
Am I a statistic in god's plan?
Am I the child with a secret?

Here in that white room
Strapped to the bed
My efforts to end this life
Was all for nothing in the end
In a remorseful state of guilt
My love came back to me
Only to find his words
Were sharp enough to kill

There I was naked and standing revealed
As I'm looking for my father's outreaching hand
I felt all the love and I saw all the light
But it wasn't my time and he cast me from sight

Why was I made to suffer?
What point could any of that serve?
Where was the love and kindness
When I needed it the most?
They say you've got to have some blind faith
It's all a part of the master plan
But take that fucked up idealism
And shove it up your ass

Am I the product of another's wickedness?
Am I the sum of all my crimes?
Am I a statistic of god's plan?
Am I the child with a secret?

It all leads here
To this point in my life
I'm under observation
By the doctor's eye
A path is still before me
A fork before my eyes
But which one should I choose
Between the darkness and the light
