There is only so much pain
That the drugs can take away
Only so much cold to feel
Before our fragile minds decay
There is nothing left that's real
When you're constantly afraid
There is nothing left to feel
When they are all running away

Running blindly through a sea of sin
Fleeing the past of who you've been
Every time you thought you found your way
Another scar in your mind

The past can't be changed
You're running away
Every time I scrub
The stains won't go away

What was I dreaming?
What the hell was I thinking?
Hope can bring you promise
It can just as easily tear you down

I'm inside the outside
I don't know my place
If forgiveness is not an option
Then theirs a harsh truth to face

The past can't be changed
You're running away
Every time I scrub
The stains won't go away
