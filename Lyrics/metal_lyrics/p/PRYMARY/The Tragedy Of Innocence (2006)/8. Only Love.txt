Time goes by and here I sit
Back to the old struggle
I thought I'd found a new haven
But addiction is so convincing

Only love can save me
Only love can set me free
I've been searching for a love
That can make me feel complete

Flying high while soul deceiving
You turn your back and nothing's left
It's wonderful what love can do
Scraping the tracks that mark you

Only love can save me
Only love can set me free
I've been searching for a love
That can make me feel complete

It's strange how things that matter
Can blow away like the breeze
I'm dying of thirst in the desert
You'll take what's at arm's reach
When he lays his hands on me
I can justify the cause
All will be forgiven
When he testifies his love

I have functioned in a haze
For the best of my life
And now it's easy for me to see
What this life has done for me
I'm reaching to find courage
God help me to speak my mind
All will be forgiven
When he testifies his love
