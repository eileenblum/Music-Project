So it ends in this room
Where my life will drain away
The death of a tortured soul
Never had a shot at life anyways

Caught in a slide, caught in a prison
Nowhere to hide, legs squeezed tight

And anyone could plainly see
The lives I touched are better without me
I've given all I had to give
Now I'm taking something for myself

Caught in a slide, caught in a prison
Nowhere to hide, legs squeezed tight
