Caressing the bottle
And burning the dragon
With no one around
It was instant comfort
Sneaking into the night
The darker side of life
Hanging with all the lowlife's
They all
Took a part of me
Took a part of me

Soul Deceiver, True believer
I can keep in all the pain
Suffocate me, violate me
I can keep in all the pain
The demons calling and I'll come crawling
To a hell that I create
The sun is setting, the light is fading
In the hell that I create

Mommy dropped the hammer
But she had lost control
In a blink of an eye
The streets were my home
At the age of fourteen
When he forced himself on me
With guilt and promises
They all
Took a part of me
Took a part of me
