As life bleeds from my skin
I'm back there taking them in
Too late to save that little girl
I couldn't live there anymore
I had to break free of myself
Of all that I am, and was forced to
This path that I have taken has led me to a light
My story flashes right before my eyes
I just can't make the distance and go on with this life
But then again the choice was never mine to make
I'm just a child, lying here
Praying to the Heavens
To send their angels for me
I'm just a child, lying here
Praying for an angel
To come and take me away
If you could just ask the angels
To take me to you
"It's not your time" they say
