So it begins in this room
Where my life was thrown astray
The death of innocence
Nothing will ever be the same

Caught in the slide, caught in a prison
Nowhere to hide, legs squeezed tight
And he shows me
Just what little girls are for
And I'm not here anymore

And even a child of five can see
There is something wrong with this
Taking what I have to give
As I'm taking him in

Caught in the slide, caught in a prison
Nowhere to hide, legs squeezed tight
And he shows me
Just what little girls are for
And I'm not here anymore
