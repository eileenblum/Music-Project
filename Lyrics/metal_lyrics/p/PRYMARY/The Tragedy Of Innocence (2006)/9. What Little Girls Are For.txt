Five years old, dirty room
Here he comes, nowhere to hide
But inside closed eyes, shrinking away
Maybe he won't see me,

Legs squeezed tight, but not tight enough
It's never enough to keep him out
There in the dirty room
He shows me just what little girls are for

Caught in a slide, caught in a prison
Nowhere to hide, legs squeezed tight
He shows me just what little girls are for
And I'm not here anymore

Fourteen years old, alone with him
Guilt and promises in another dirty room
"If you really love me ...I promise we'll take it slow"
I guess he might have meant it - until I said no

Legs squeezed tight, but not tight enough
It's never enough to keep him out
Lying there with eyes closed tight
It'll be over soon if I don't put up a fight

Where the pain ends
Is where I begin
Scars are hidden deep within
Where only memories remain
I can tell you my secrets
But the pain is my own
It's always a reminder
Of what little girls are for

So I learned I was never worth as much
As when I was down on my knees
Or giving away these pieces of me
Silent screams in my head
Until I don't know who I am
I fear that I may have nothing left to give
As I'm taking them in
I'm losing myself to the wind
And my cries to god fall on silent ears
Now I know for sure just what little girls are for
And I'm not here,
And I'm not here,
And I'm not here anymore

Twenty-three years old, alone in the car
Except for him as he shuts the door
I'm suddenly reminded what I am for
With eyes closed tight as I'm spinning

Legs squeezed tight
But not tight enough, it's never enough to keep him out
Oh please God... not again,
Another piece of me that's empty and dead

Where the pain ends
Caught in the slide
Is where I begin
Caught in a prison
Scars are hidden deep within
Nowhere to hide
Where only memories remain
Legs squeezed tight
I can tell you my secrets
And he shows me
But the pain is my own
What little girls are for
Always a reminder
And I'm not here
Of what little girls are for
Not here anymore

Thirty years old and you're in my life
And you're so different from all the rest
The words from your lips tell me I'm worth so much more than I know
And maybe someday soon I'll believe
Your words can save me, erase these old stains
And help me to pick up the pieces of me
And maybe I'll find some redemption
And maybe someday soon I will find forgiveness for all my sins
And give me some room to come undone and find myself again

I am here... I am here somewhere
