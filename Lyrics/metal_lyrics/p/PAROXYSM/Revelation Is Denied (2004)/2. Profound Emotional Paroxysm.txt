From the infinite deepness of my soul
The depth of my inner being
A new found amorphous state of mind
Causes skirmish in my emotional feelings
A quest for what? eternal life? reach perfection?
Blackness is strong and dubious
Too easy to reach and feed
Eat away light and vomiting it into depression

A war is raging inside of me
Causing an endless depression
Anxiety that causes tears
Through my whole body

In my dreams I see total equilibrium
Beauty sometimes blackened by storms
A weird interpretations of my innerself
A mockery of my own reality

A war is raging inside of me
Causing an endless depression
Anxiety that causes tears
Through my whole body

From the infinite deepness of my soul
The depth of my inner being
A new found amorphous state of mind
Causes skirmish in my emotional feelings

How can I escape?... this emotional paroxysm
Only in my dreams... reality seems sweet to live
The wrath of depression... an horrible state of mind
Profound emotional paroxysm

In my dreams I see total equilibrium
Beauty sometimes blackened by storms
A weird interpretations of my innerself
A mockery of my own reality
