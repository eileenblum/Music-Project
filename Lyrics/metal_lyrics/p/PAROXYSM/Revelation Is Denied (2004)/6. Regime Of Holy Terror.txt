Welcome to a world of terror!
Where hatred, intolerance and stupidity prevails
Where liberty and innocence are tarnished by screams and blood
Where blinded slaves of integrism fall on their knees
And follow the regime of holy terror

Desperate by their hopeless cause
Guided by so-called pure religious leaders
They find a way to save their souls

Slaves of integrism, blinded by faith
You try to impose this regime of hate
You try to install a life of terror
Total insecurity......

Always invoking the jihad
You try to involve your own nation
In an endless and worthless war
It's so easy, foolish!!!

Desperate by their hopeless cause
Guided by so-called pure religious leaders
They find a way to save their souls
Immortalized by suicide [x2]

Regime of... regime of... regime of...
Regime of... regime of... regime of...
Holy terror... holy hate

Desperate by their hopeless cause
Guided by so-called pure religious leaders
They find a way to save their souls
Immortalized by suicide
