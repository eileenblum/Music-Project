Feed by perfection
Not by revolution
Path of the mass
Production chain of society
You bleed I bleed but that doesn't hurt

Lack of diversity the sky is always black [x2]

You're the next to fucking die
The same way as yesterday
Crushed by the hammer
Of the supreme master
White is white, black is black
Say what you have to say

You bleed I bleed but that doesn't hurt!
Addiction to illusion

The highway is without exit
Addiction to a way where illusion is pretty
The highway is without exit
Addiction to a way where illusion is pretty

Followers fall on their knees
When the black sky turns white
They find other way to run [x2]
Addiction to illusion [x2]

You're the next to fucking die
The same way as yesterday
Crushed by the hammer
Of the supreme master
White is white, black is black
Say what you have to say

Once upon the end
Addiction to illusion
The poor story of a society
Where everyone finishes in the pit!
