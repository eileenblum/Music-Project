There are million faces that I've never seen
There are floating eyes that are staring at me
There are million fates that I have never lived
So many whispering voices call us to convene

So let's meld up to twisted flesh
We unify ourselves in viscous mesh
Now we're born as new essence
And each of us is cells in this weird concrescence

A painful pleasure it's thing, we want to share
With all who know how beauty, sick'n'madness there
We pull our bounded arms, so nasty and obscene
Whispering voices call us to convene

So let's meld up to twisted flesh
We unify ourselves in viscous mesh
Now we're born as new essence
And each of us is cells in this weird concrescence
