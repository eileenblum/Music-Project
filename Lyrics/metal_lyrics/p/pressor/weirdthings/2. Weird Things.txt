You know that's feeling
It's a long expected pain
It's melt down your brain
Like sun melt's everything
Get boost perception
And gain your madness now
Discard all private stuff
It's time to disappear

It's time to
Be disappeared in waves of doom
It's time to
Disintegrate in froth of gloom
It's time, it's time
To make a touch to form constant
It's time, it's time
For everything, that's all you want

You know that feeling
It's a long awaited bane
This brings a high vibes
Which should help you break the chain
Get boost perception
Overgain your sickness now
Discard all what you know
It's time to disappear

It's time to
Be disappeared in waves of doom
It's time to
Disintegrate in froth of gloom
It's time, it's time
To make a touch to form constant
It's time, it's time
For everything, that's all you want

So this is it, is what you waiting for
You drop the shield to come in this sense door
Now you can see, now you can feel, you can take
But my advice is watch out and beware
Some of this ways are cruel

So this is it, is what you waiting for
Now you and me in same place behind that door
Now there is no, is no way to return
But my advice is go straight ahead
Some of this ways are cruel

On the screen of my eyelids happen weird things
Weird things in my head

On the screen of my eyelids happen bad things
Sick and disgusting

On the screen of my eyelids happen weird things
Weird things in my head

On the screen of my eyelids, on the screen of my eyelidsâ¦

So what are you see?
So what are you feel?
There is melting darkness
And you'll stay here
