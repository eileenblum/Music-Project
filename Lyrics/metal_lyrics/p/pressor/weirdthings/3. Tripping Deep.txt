We are sail to obscure
Transcendental sea
Weirdy and tall
Altered reality
Our craft is so old
Like a birth of a sense
We are psychic sailors
And we are prepared

To discover the minds capes
To direct, guide and lead
Through your trembling fears
And anxiety
We are prepared for
Each of all psy-disease
For massive of waves
And for doom, yes indeed

There is lighting sky
With a sparky reflections
Kaleidoscopic
Massive ejections
The sea makes me sick
And a water has calling
I'm starting to drifting
Away

From spreading the range
To a spatial dimension
Near fractalic rose
Through electric tension
I'm keeping my way
Across the waves of decay
Do you think it madness?
Full speed ahead I say!

Crushing, knockdown
And skating psy-storm
Has strike back

Down falling down
My mind blended out
From his stable form
And starts to floating around

Specters and wraith
Come to our disgrace
Abyss devoted
Weird, creep and bloated

So this is the end
Or may be beginning
We merge our minds
And starts to believing
Now we a part
Of sea, storm and waves
Now we a part
Of your mind disgrace

We so huge above
And giant below
We coming so soon
From thousand years ago
We know real and true
Taste of latitude
Greatness of immensity
