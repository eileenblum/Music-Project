[Music: Asmodeus &amp; Schwarz / Lyrics: Asmodeus]

Underneath (or below)
Orions sword (the sword of the crown)
The impiety of coldness, you feel
The basement of my life is distorted act of love
In an area of different emotions - I only see...
- My own end... hate turns to sorrow
- Love shines bright - Through the darkness
I can hear the bells from beyond -
The evil ones are still alive

No hope for the ... holy ground ?
Fire
Fire

My soul is damned
I have no hope
Fly out of my mind
Fire
Fire
