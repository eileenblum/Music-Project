[Music: Schwarz &amp; Asmodeus / Lyrics: Asmodeus &amp; Schwarz]

Black tears are creeping down my skin
Is this the beginning - The beginning of my end ?
- I am forsaken
Like tears     - I know their abilities
In the dust    - Their might to force your mind
Like tears     - Their unaggressiv thoughts
In the dust    - Will break your pride

I'm not created - created to live eternal
I can't stand - can't stand this pain

Like tears     - I know their abilities
In the dust    - Their might to force your mind
Like tears     - Their unaggressiv thoughts
In the dust    - Will break your pride

The power of hope will be burned
When earth turns to hell

Hearts full of sadness - Love is born dead
I'm not allowed to take command

Like tears     - I know their abilities
In the dust    - Their might to force your mind
Like tears     - Their unaggressiv thoughts
In the dust    - Will break your pride

Now I am king an ruler over
No, I'm a deceiver to my own mind -
Ahhh

Majesty - I'm god over thee
Insanity - The sky that burns in me
In Ebony - My face is...
Immortalized for you

Energy - Energy
Entity - Entity
Sadly - Sadly
Again

Nailed - punisher on the cross
The Key - Buried in eternal frost
Lifeless - The emperor, That's me
Heavenly agony

Energy - Energy
Entity - Entity
Sadly - Sadly
Never more

Long ago I wandered through the bodies
I'm the soul that's left behind

Like tears     - I know their abilities
In the dust    - Their might to force your mind
Like tears     - Their unaggressiv thoughts
In the dust    - Will break your pride

Like tears     - I know their abilities
In the dust    - Their might to force your mind
Like tears     - Their unaggressiv thoughts
In the dust    - Will break your pride

[Repeat]
