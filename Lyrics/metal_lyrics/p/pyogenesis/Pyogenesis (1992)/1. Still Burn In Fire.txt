[Music: Asmodeus &amp; Schwarz / Lyrics: Asmodeus]

Castle of desire - With blood-drunken choirs
Songs of sorrow - Resound through the halls

The thoughts of lust - Remain in my brain
The feelings I get - From the towers of hate
Castle of desire - With blood-drunken choirs
Songs of sorrow - Resound through the halls

Hopeless madness to burial oblivion
A slave to darkness, again

Burn in the fire of lust - So strong
It's so hot, cold, a delivery of my soul
Blasphemy

It's the fire that keeps me warm
Holds me tight and burns me right
It's the fire that burns in me

Still burn in fire !
It's my still burnin' fire

It's the fire that keeps me warm
Holds me tight and burns me right
It's the fire that burns in me

Whispers - I try to understand them
Living in a world of visions
I think I'm dying
Sadness - This is my price
For all the sins
I've done to you

Majesty crown - Allowed to speak black
Serenades with crimson decades
Change the face - With the mask of pain
Special dreams - The shadow-hunt returns
Come on to the arrival of this hungry flame
Irreverent is her name
It's my knocking, calling, burning chest
Delivery of the bestialized haircrest

It's the fire that keeps me warm
Holds me tight and burns me right
It's the fire that burns in me

Still burn in fire !
It's my still burnin' fire

It's the fire that keeps me warm
Holds me tight and burns me right
It's the fire that burns in me

Whispers - I try to understand them
Living in a world of visions
I thinkI'm dying
Sadness - This is my price
For all the sins
I've done to you
