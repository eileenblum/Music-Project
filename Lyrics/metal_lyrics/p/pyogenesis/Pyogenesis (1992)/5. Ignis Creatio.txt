[Music: Schwarz / Lyrics: Schwarz]

Woe ! There's Wrath In My Veins - Filled With Anger, Hope And Pride -
Occasionally I Fell Like Flowing Down A Stream - I've Been Used To Believe
In Things I Do And Things I've Done Like A Tender Mother Gives Love To Her
Son - Friendship And Relationship - It's Not Much More Far And Wide - Keep
Your Emotions In Good Memory Keep Them Right - Ashes To Ashes - Dust To Dust
