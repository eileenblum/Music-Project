[Music: Asmodeus &amp; Schwarz / Lyrics: Asmodeus]

Beauty and happiness, world of health
The power, the glory, the might of ourselves
Fights, hate, greed and the maze

But then comes the fire
Tyrrany reigns
Harmony is damaged - Love gets exhomed
Now my hammer falls

Choir of the gods resound through this night
A billter last warning
The appearance of the giants - Hail
The battle begins
Last flight on soulwings

Perfunctory leading light
Empirical engulfed in unaccountable winds
Like the typhoons hand
This emotional screams touch my ears
Harmonies hazard - That this crown sings ?

Choir of the gods resound through this night
A billter last warning
The appearance of the giants - Hail
The battle begins
Last flight on soulwings

[Repeat]
