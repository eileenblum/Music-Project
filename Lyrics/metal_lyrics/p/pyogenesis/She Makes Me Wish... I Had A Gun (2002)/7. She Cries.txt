[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Too much anger, too much argue
That seems not ok
I don't see a need to change my mind
so tell me how about you
It has to be over - no need for a lie
It has to be over - let's say good bye
It has to be over - even if she cries
How much longer you want to go on
some things never change
I don't want, I don't need, I don't see a way out
We won't rearrange
It has to be over - no need for a lie
It has to be over - let's say good bye
It has to be over - even if she cries
