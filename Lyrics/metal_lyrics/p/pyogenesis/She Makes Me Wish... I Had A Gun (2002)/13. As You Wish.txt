[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Is this destiny
how you come up to me
Cause I love you, need you
and you just treat me bad
I can't leave you I'm addicted
no I can't
As you wish
As you wish I comply selfless
Meekly I listen as you wish
As you wish
Your brave soldier, me
Does what you want of him
Cause I love you, need you
and you just treat me bad
I can't leave you I'm addicted
no I can't
As you wish
As you wish I comply selfless
Meekly I listen as you wish
As you wish
