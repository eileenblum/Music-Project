[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Why don't
why don't you trust me
don't you believe me
don't you believe
Here comes your fortune
the one and only
the one who's holy
I wish I was
Everything you wanna know oh you my dear
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Everything you wanna know oh you my dear
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
My love
so close to your heart
whenever I'll start
it's not gonna work
Cause I am failing (failing)
in what I'm trying (trying)
for love I'm crying (crying)
My heart beats fast (so fast)
Everything you wanna know oh you my dear
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Everything you wanna know oh you my dear
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
