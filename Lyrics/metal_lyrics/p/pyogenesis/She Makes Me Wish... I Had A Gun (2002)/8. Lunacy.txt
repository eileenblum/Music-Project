[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

I do have this feeling - not to stay at home
wanna see some people - don't wanna be alone
Altough my town offers me places
they even could be nice,
I would leave earlier than sunrise
Lunacy, Lunacy
You can leave behind all anger,
You can leave behind all pain
Cause we're not living for tomorrow
We are living for today
In a place called "Lunacy"
Porno, he's our mercher,
he goes there as well
like all the other people
to "Hamburger Hill"
I drink champaign with Red Bull on ice
And pay a special price
I won't leave erlieer than sunrise
Lunacy, Lunacy
You can leave behind all anger,
You can leave behind all pain
Cause we're not living for tomorrow
We are living for today
In a place called "Lunacy"
