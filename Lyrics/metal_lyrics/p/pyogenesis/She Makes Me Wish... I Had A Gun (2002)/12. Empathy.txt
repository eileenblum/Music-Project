[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Life is over, oh can't you see,
now all these angles come down to me
and they all hug me, kiss me, heal me, treat me,
give back my life. I feel gratefull, gratefull for my life
Empathy, endlessly, empathy - all right
Empathy, endlessly, empathy - all right
Thank the angels, I'm not underneath
surrounded by all my friends I breath
and they all hug me, kiss me, heal me, treat me,
give back my life. I feel gratefull, gratefull for my life
Empathy, endlessly, empathy - all right
Empathy, endlessly, empathy - all right
Empathy, endlessly, empathy - all right
Empathy, endlessly, empathy - all right
