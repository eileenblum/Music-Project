[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

It's not a propper situation - in my mind
No need to canvass all these stations
I can't find another way to ask
if you do feel the same as I do for you
I need an answer now - answer now!
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho - Don't you say maybe
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho - Don't you say maybe
Your answer may be a perspective - in my live
It also could be too destructive - I can't
Find another way to ask if you fell
the same as I do for you
I need an answer now
answer now!
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho - Don't you say maybe
Oho, oho, oho, oho, oho - Don't you say maybe
