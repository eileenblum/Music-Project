[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

You don't have
many good feelings left for me
So hard I'm trying
to convince you to give us time
You say you don't
love me the way a lover should
And in the end I
even tried harder than I could
Pain of a heartache
Pain of a heartache
Pain of a heartache"We may stay friends"
That's not enough as you might guess
I can't continue
without your hugs without your kiss
I feel ashamed
So many things I'd change I would
And in the end I
even tried harder than I could
Pain of a heartache
Pain of a heartache
Pain of a heartache
