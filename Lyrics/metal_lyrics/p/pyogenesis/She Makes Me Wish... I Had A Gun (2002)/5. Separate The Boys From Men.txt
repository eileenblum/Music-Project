[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Growing up with patience
means you'll be a man
Going through all stations
not only you will understand
Cause all the kids are staying kids
and all serious become men
Don't give a shit, don't look behind you
and time will seperate
Seperate the boys from men
Sort out everything you can
- All the boys from men
- Everything you can
Now, you've gotten older
now, you've gotten wise
You tell all the youngsters
give them your best known advice
Cause all the kids are staying kids
and all serious become men
Don't give a shit, don't look behind you
and time will seperate
Seperate the boys from men
Sort out everything you can
- All the boys from men
- Everything you can
