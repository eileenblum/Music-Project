[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

I can't believe all the things you wanna say
I wanna live my life in my own special way
I wanna sleep all day - today's the day
I wanna rock the night - tonight's the night
You think you're right just because you're up to date
Can't sleep at night, just because I am awake
I wanna sleep all day - today's the day
I wanna rock the night - tonight's the night
You think you're right just because you're up to date
Can't sleep at night, just because
I am awake
Out sight, out of mind,
out of life, out of time,
out of in, out of out,
I can't scream, I can't shout,
I can't run, I can't hide,
out of sight out of mind,
(get) out (of) my way
I can't stay
I wanna sleep all day - today's the day
I wanna rock the night - tonight's the night
I wanna sleep all day - today's the day
I wanna rock the night - tonight's the night
