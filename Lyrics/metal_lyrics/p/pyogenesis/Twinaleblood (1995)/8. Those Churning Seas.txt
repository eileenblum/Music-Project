I remember every day
When you were running all the way
With all my infiorities
And ode to all those churning seas
Yeah - I'm not the only one
Who's left alone
In sorrow - I'm starving
Now I feel I am your slave
I will behave
To you my sweet darling - I will

Take me right - my will remains
Whatever will be done
Nothing but a stain
Everything what I have seen is what I've ever been
Moving less delirium

Sometimes you should learn
Inside the shell you'll burn
Expect absolutely nothing going through my head
No way to hide and stuff I'm better of dead

I'm turning days inside
The way is barred to hide
I never be disgusted by my own

I remember every day
When you were running all the way
With all my infiorities
And ode to all those churning seas
Yeah - I'm not the only one
Who's left alone
In sorrow - I'm starving
Now I feel I am your slave
I will behave
To you my sweet darling - I will
