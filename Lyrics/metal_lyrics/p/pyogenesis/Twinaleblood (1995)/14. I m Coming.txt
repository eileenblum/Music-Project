Deep black morning
No easy way out of life
The dead still callin'
Soon I will arise

Just one step to the edge of the final match
Doubts changin' my mind
I'm a graveyard singer a slow death bringer
A gambler, a liar,
A still burning fire

I'm coming - yeah

Now is all over my throne is gone
At the gallon I'm hanging right beside my son
Tears of joy runnin' down my skin
My soul is laughing, they'll never win

I'm coming - yeah

Blood red dawning
Slowly passing by
The wind is calling
Just fly away

Just one step to the edge of the final match
Doubts changin' my mind
I'm a graveyard singer a slow death bringer
A gambler, a liar,
A still burning fire
Fire

I'm coming - yeah

Here the shadows shining bright
Once I'm gleaming in the night
