Yeah, you are my twinaleblood
Your life is my infinity, your shape was made by ecstasy
Yeah, you are my twinaleblood
Whenever you will dream of me, just hold on to reali'-ecstasy (ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstacy)

Entering the levels high
At my very first try
Drying all my hopeless tears
I've been crying (crying, crying) through the years
All the people on this earth are truely one

Yeah, you are my twinaleblood
Your life is my infinity, your shape was made by ecstasy
Yeah, you are my twinaleblood
Whenever you will dream of me, just hold on to reali'-ecstasy (ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstacy)

Created by a brand new style
Valentine please wait a while
Confusion of a senseless game
What a stupid unknown name

What a pain, what a sign
Can you read between the lines
Can you feel those waving words
And consume everything that hurts
