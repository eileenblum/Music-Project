One with the stars
A planet's sweetest perfection
Infernal heat I bear
Free like the wind, just one direction

Godless inferno, forbidden birth

Weep like the sun

Straight from the soul
Strange like senseless action
Drink this blood which I spill
Come down with me use this latest attraction

Bodies burning, set them free

Weep like the sun

Turmoils turning, rest in peace
Weep like the sun
