All of those senseless things
With my life

In one who sees kids and sun
Art on the I'm one
The fire of the hearts burns quietly
And everything I want to do is wrong

But these are hopeless tears forever
Hopeless tears today
Hopeless tears and never...
We'll run and hide we'll hide and run
We're running all the way

Release the sweetest beast
And throw him to the sky
Autumns heat I will release don't wonder why
I always swim in milk and blood I'll burn in my own hell
After this you take a bath because you smell

But these are hopeless tears forever
Hopeless tears today
Hopeless tears and never...
We'll run and hide we'll hide and run
We're running all the way

Whenever I move carefully, yes without bodies
One with all those broken dreams, senseless grief
No one cares and no one loves - I'm still alone
My thoughts they play dead - everything's ruined

But these are hopeless tears forever
Hopeless tears today
Hopeless tears and never...
We'll run and hide we'll hide and run
We're running all the way

This is my empty space
