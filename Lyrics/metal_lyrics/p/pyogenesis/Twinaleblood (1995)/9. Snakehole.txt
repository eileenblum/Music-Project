Listen to me babe
You're the one I never want to be
Start right here damned thing
Can't you see the things you've never changed

So close your evil eyes
Always or never I don't mind these stupid things
It's a shame, such a shame

I remember you my dear - in the snakehole
When you are breaking my golden seal - in the snakehole
The golden seal of innocence - in the snakehole

Listen to me twice
Shut up your mouth I hate the way you talk
Punishment will come
A rope around your neck, the bleeding of your dawn

So close your evil eyes always or never
I don't mind these stupid things
It's a shame, such a shame

I remember you my dear - in the snakehole
When you are breaking my golden seal - in the snakehole
The golden seal of innocence - in the snakehole
I still remember your promised land - in the snakehole

After all these years
My dreams have become reality to me
A bleeding with no end
Isn't that fair? Is that fair?

I remember you my dear - in the snakehole
When you are breaking my golden seal - in the snakehole
The golden seal of innocence - in the snakehole
I still remember your promised land - in the snakehole
