Single my dearest
Definitly you are the one
Of those darker individuals
How could I know
How could I see the things the way you do
How could I feel that your heart is crying

I try to turn whenever I see her
I know my eyes will burn
A split from my addiction pole, today

I'm all tied up, my eyes are always shut
It's all too strong, too tough to cut
Our love seeds here, planted to grow
Take my breath and I will go

I try to turn whenever I see her
I know my eyes will burn
A split from my addiction pole, today

Oh damned lady, can't you hear the churchbell ring
The eternal mon comes soon, much too soon

I try to turn whenever I see her
I know my eyes will burn
A split from my addiction pole, today
