These words burnin' you like fire
Turning your desire
To the highesy level And there's no need to cry
It won't happen anymore
Steal my thoughts but before
I will lose my...

Dreams and emotions bleeding
Do you hear me crying behind you
Behind your face a secret is sleeping
Yeah I'm weeping down
Down - gettin' around
You're my supavenus, babe

The river of love has frozen over
Some friendly voices from nowhere
Tell me girl how much can I love them
And bring me down, hunt me down
I'm falling away
In pain now

Dreams and emotions bleeding
Do you hear me crying behind you
Behind your face a secret is sleeping
Yeah I'm weeping down
Down - gettin' around
You're my supavenus, babe

These words burnin' you like fire
Turning your desire
To the highesy level And there's no need to cry
It won't happen anymore
Steal my thoughts but before
I will lose my...

Dreams and emotions bleeding
Do you hear me crying behind you
Behind your face a secret is sleeping
Yeah I'm weeping down
Down - gettin' around
You're my supavenus, babe
