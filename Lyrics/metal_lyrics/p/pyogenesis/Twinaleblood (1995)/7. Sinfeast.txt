Taste my lips and fly away
Taste my mind, your thoughts
Drown my death and fly
The divine taste of sin

Away away like a history to the infernal
I'm always on the run
Not so far away and through my soul

Sinfeast

Faith in the ways of lust
Holy deeds inside my path
After all pure lust
I give it all away to you

Sinfeast

Burn with me, hit me
You're out of luck
Bless good sins, loss of love
Do you think that I'm still insane

Sinfeast
