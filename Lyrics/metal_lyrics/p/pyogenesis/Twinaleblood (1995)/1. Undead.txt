It's cold here, show me the sky you see
I don't have wings to fly but I have a will
This way - I feel
A lie - is real
Screaming for heaven, resting souls rebirth

Cause we are undead fading away
No will to live, the pain, we can't stay
We are undead fading away
There's no return only dismay

I've tasted life, words air I breathe
But my lungs are dry not able to work
The way - I feel
A lie - is real
Screaming for heaven, resting souls rebirth

Cause we are undead fading away
No will to live, the pain, we can't stay
We are undead fading away
There's no return only dismay

All ends now - nothing is like it was before
Lost my will to live and lost all I adore
I've lost it all

Cause we are undead fading away
No will to live, the pain, we can't stay
We are undead fading away
There's no return only dismay
