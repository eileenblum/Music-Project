A furious form of life in an age of distrust
Just everything falls apart
No soft beating heart
Dead colour of night
Death coloured the night
Just a dead black light

Broken dreams, this anger pulls me through
A violent (useless) mind forever I lost you

Abstract life - I need your...
Abstract life - abstract sentiments

Wet lipstick scarce and eyeballs badly hurt
Mouth full of salty fluid nausea takes control
Dead colour of flesh
Death coloured the flesh
World full of pain
Dead colour of flesh

Bored and scared some more
I'm one with you
I lick the moon and remember mines all through

Abstract life - I need your...
Abstract life - abstract sentiments
