"...Justice is to be found only in imagination." 
[Alfred Nobel, 1833-1896]

It's blocked 
The way 
Let's not
Wait for...and until decay
Corrupt and corrode
Live in mortal fear
A torturous ode
All end is near

Blaze, my northern flame, for me
Burn away, burn away
Set afire the entire world
A human's thought got the Devil's tool

A life 
A way 
Approach
Abyss of a soul's decay
Corrupt and corrode
Live in mortal fear
A torturous ode
All end is near

Blaze, my northern flame, for me
Burn away, burn away
Set afire the entire world
A human's thought got the Devil's tool
