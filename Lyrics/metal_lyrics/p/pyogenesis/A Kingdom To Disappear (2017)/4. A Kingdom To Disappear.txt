"...Poland is not yet lost!" 
[Polish National Anthem]

Can you feel the unmight of my reign?
How can I counter when everything's in vain!
But oh, people have no fear
In a kingdom to disappear!

And it is too late, and it is too late
And it is to late
And it is too late, and it is too late
And it is to late

Cut by the fat profligate,
The emperor and Catherine the Great,
Vanished from the face of the Earth
For 123 years.
But oh, people have no fear
In a kingdom to disappear!

And it is too late, and it is too late
And it is to late
And it is too late, and it is too late
And it is to late
