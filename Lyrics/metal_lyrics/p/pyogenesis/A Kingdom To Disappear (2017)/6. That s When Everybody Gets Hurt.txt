I am dying alone while you were with me at home
For us, woe come life, come death 
Halting, you take your last breath

It's over, my friend
That's when everybody gets hurt
In this moment, again.
It's over, my friend
That's when everybody gets hurt
We have chosen the end

None foreshadowed the end 
No one to seek revenge
No matter what people throw 
But the two of us only know

It's over, my friend
That's when everybody gets hurt
In this moment, again.
It's over, my friend
That's when everybody gets hurt
We have chosen the end
