"...Can a heart be of gold if it rusts?"

As I reached a blind alley
I had no where else to go
But to Central Valley
To exploit and make it grow
So I did and I reaped fruit of my hands work
The wealth I enriched
Turned daylight into murk

I have faith and love you
Was the last I heard
When I set my sails
And embarked upon a new world
I will name it New Helvetia
Where I'll lose it all
So what,
True hope knows no equal
And I'll lose it all

Gold, no way to conceal
As wanderers pour out
Convoys of officials
Gather to set about
Can a heart be of gold if it rusts?
It can't here I'm with you,
And so much for my trust!

I have faith and love you
Was the last I heard
When I set my sails
And embarked upon a new world
I will name it New Helvetia
Where I'll lose it all
So what,
True hope knows no equal
And I'll lose it all
