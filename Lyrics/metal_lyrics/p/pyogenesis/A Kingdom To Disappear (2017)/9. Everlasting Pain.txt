First there was this lie, second we defied
Third I had to go, beg for help, well I don't know
Fourth I had to stay, not when you were here

When I got your death notice, my breath
Would turn to ice!
And so my heart bursts at the seam but never dies

Can never feel the same, can every little flame
Just hold its breath and set afire the rain
Hold you by my side
The tears that I have cried
Are an everlasting pain

Never felt so blue, never felt so sad,
Never felt so lone, since I am on my own
Never felt so weak, not since you were here

I can't stand this pain, can't stand this life
Can't stand myself
And so I repeat these words for the world to know

Can never feel the same, can every little flame
Just hold its breath and set afire the rain
Hold you by my side
The tears that I have cried
Are an everlasting pain

A silent soul screams loud
Since there's no hope to sprout
My heart will bleed until the sun burns out
I'm left to be alone
I'm sentenced to atone
And all I wish is just to have you home

Can never feel the same, can every little flame
Just hold its breath and set afire the rain
Hold you by my side
The tears that I have cried
Are an everlasting pain
