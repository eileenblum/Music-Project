"...Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes." - Oscar Wilde, 1854-1900

People die of common sense, Dorian.
One lost moment at a time.
There's no hereafter.
So make it burn with the hardest flame.
Am I to fade?
Am I to share this fate?

I have seen my soul!
It's rotten, black as coal!
For all I see is decay.
Take a look, take a look
At the picture of Dorian Gray!

How sad it is. I shall grow old!
If it only were I who's to be always young
And the picture grows old.
For that I would give everything
I would give my soul for that.
I can assure you,
Pleasure is very different from happiness.

I have seen my soul!
It's rotten, black as coal!
For all I see is decay.
Take a look, take a look
At the picture of Dorian Gray!
