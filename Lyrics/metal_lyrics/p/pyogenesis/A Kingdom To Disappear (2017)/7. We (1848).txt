"...The passing bells were tolling for an everybody's soul."

1848 the people addressed it to the king
"...End the serious, imperious
Regency that's fearing us"

Thus the passing bells
Were tolling
For an everybody's soul
254 - Can't take no more
But 40,000 stood brave for

This fail, tonight
We were all at liberty
To bail for rights
We were brave
While bombard's burst was hailing skies
We were always young,
We were the youth!
We had no choice, this time!

From the Baltic Sea
To the Black Forest
One could hear
From Pomerania to the Alps
For the very first time in German history

People had a vote on whom
To represent them (and the) right to build
A national assembly at their will

This fail, tonight
We were all at liberty
To bail for rights
We were brave
While bombard's burst was hailing skies
We were always young,
We were the youth!
We had no choice, this time!

"...The great question of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions...but by iron and blood." 
[Otto Von Bismarck, 1815-1898]
