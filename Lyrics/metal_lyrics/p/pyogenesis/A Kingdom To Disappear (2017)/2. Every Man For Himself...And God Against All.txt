"...Nothing lives less in me than my life"
[Kaspar Hauser, 1812-1833]

16 years imprisonment
16 years no talk
16 years of darkness
While I didn't breathe a word

I'll be missing tonight, but no one will miss me
I have not grown lonely but I've always been
I'll be gone for this time while each one is dancing
I have not grown lonely but I've always been

Now that I'm set loose - My breathing seems diffuse
I shall overcome this life - Overcome this abuse

I'll be missing tonight, but no one will miss me
I have not grown lonely but I've always been
I'll be gone for this time while each one is dancing
I have not grown lonely but I've always been

Every man for himself and god against all,
A crime against a man's soul

I'll be missing tonight, but no one will miss me
I have not grown lonely but I've always been
I'll be gone for this time while each one is dancing
I have not grown lonely but I've always been
