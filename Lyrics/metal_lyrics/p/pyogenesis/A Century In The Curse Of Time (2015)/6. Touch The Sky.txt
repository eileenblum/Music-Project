[Digipak Bonus Track]I canât live without this feeling.
Touch my skin and touch the sky,
whenever Iâm fine with dreaming,
Iâll be on my way up high!

Life belongs to the living, and he who lives must be prepared for changes.
Even death may die with strange aeons.
No one tests the depth of a river with both feet.
No one can stand this heat, when darkest world reached dawn.

I canât live without this feeling.
Touch my skin and touch the sky,
whenever Iâm fine with dreaming,
Iâll be on my way up high!

It is easy to be brave when far away from danger.
For I become shy with strangers, when darkest world reached dawn.
What we need canât be given and we were told we canât avoid,
that everything must be destroyed, when darkest world reached dawn.

I canât live without this feeling.
Touch my skin and touch the sky,
whenever Iâm fine with dreaming,
Iâll be on my way up high!
