Uncharmed crowned by just 18
Richard Wagner's patron was caring
Muse stuck in his heart of hearths
Thus he spent some reputation for his arts

I know credit belongs to him
For new swan stone
The rinegold and the ring cycle
Technics, humanity
Dislike large public
Without losing popularity

Art, opus, architecture
The life, the living
The death of the swan king

Declined any war in general
It was two times
He had to compromise
Approval to the German Reich
His late behaviour
Led to be declared insane

Deposition and custody
While the last walk
The king met his mysterious death
And Dr gudden4s
And in remembrance
The cross, the wooden, was set

Art, opus, architecture
The life, the living
The death of the swan king
