Fire boiling water
Pressure in a vessel

Steam paves its way, the machine
Once it shakes
It proceeds like a tambourine
Pressurized, this pile
Explodes once in a while
Lift what a thousands can't shift
The times are out of joint
In new ages we drift
We re armed, we re headfirst

Burst into flames
By fire rearranged

Gasping tons of metal
Moaning while they move

Steam paves its way, the machine
Once it shakes
It proceeds like a tambourine
Pressurized, this pile
Explodes once in a while
Lift what a thousands can't shift
The times are out of joint
In new ages we drift
We re armed, we re headfirst
Scientific thirst
We re armed, we re head first

Burst into flames
By fire rearranged

Machinery competes against man
A dirge for those who can
