Hopeless this morning
Receiving no sun in these days
I can t remember the last time
Above those sea's waves

That a monster exists
Said french scientist
In warning to all the world!
With a courageously
Dauntless harpoonist
And his butler
Who backed up as third

They travelled the seas
To get hold of the beast
When one night
Their fat was deserved
An impact ship's crunch
Somethings wrong
Just a hunch?
On the back on the beast
They got hurled

This will take another breath
My friend (but)
This won't last forever
This will take another try
This will take another grace
My friend (but)
This won't last forever
This will take some time
Hopeless this morning
Receiving no sun in these days
I can t remember the last time
Above those sea's waves

Inside a metal construct
Steam -engine driven sub
Built by the hand of man
A captain, his crew
In a vessel full of dew
Below the surface of water
They swam
Lived their lives
Far apart civilized "a la carte"
Desire for revenge was their plan
Too much grief about the past
There s a will to last
To abolish all they can

20 thousand leagues, 20 thousand leagues, 20 thousand leagues
Under the sea

This will take another breath
My friend (but)
This won't last forever
This will take another try
This will take another breath
My friend (but)
This won't last forever
This will take some time
