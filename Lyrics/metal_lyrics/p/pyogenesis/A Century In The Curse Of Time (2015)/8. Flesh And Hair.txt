Let me spare the rod
And spoil the child
Sear me, so help me god
I forced a smile

Who doesn't know slovenly peter
The dreadful story of matches
Consumed is all (so) sweet and fair
The total child (both) flesh and hair

Flesh and hair
Consumed is all so sweet and fair
Flesh and hair!

How could we let the parent know?
And mintz and mountz sit sighing
With breaking hearths and crying
While round that ash pile glowing
In brooks their tears keep flowing

Flesh and hair
Consumed is all so sweet and fair
Flesh and hair!

But ah, the flame it caught her clothes
Her apron, too and higher rose
Her hand is burnt, her hair's afire
Consumed is the child entire

Flesh and hair
Consumed is all so sweet and fair
Flesh and hair!
