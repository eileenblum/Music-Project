This world tonight is turning
Like an every night, tonight
This world tonight is turning
Like an every night, tonight
This world tonight is turning
Like an every night, tonight
This world tonight is turning
Like an every night, tonight

Oh for the sake of progress
In our prime. We built machines
A century in curse of time

Oh for the sake of progress
In our prime. We built factories
A century in curse of time

Oh for the sake of progress
In our prime. Built capital
A century in curse of time

Just stop this fake of progress
Ease the strain!
The proletariat is
In the curse of time!
