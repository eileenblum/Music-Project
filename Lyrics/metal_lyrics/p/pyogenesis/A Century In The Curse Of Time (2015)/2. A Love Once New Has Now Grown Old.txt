Man! O man take care!
What does the deep midnight declare?
I was asleep
From a deep dream I woke and swear!
Like a religion that had failed
A blinded mission we once hailed
It only makes us stronger

The times
That we all hoped would last
Like a bird flew by, so fast
We've been told
A love once new has now grown old

The final reward of the dead
To die no more, is what he said
And complemented: god is dead!
The only christian died on (the) cross
But ancient wisdom: that which does
Not kill us makes us stronger!

That we all hoped would last
Like a bird flew by, so fast
We've been told
A love once new has now grown old
