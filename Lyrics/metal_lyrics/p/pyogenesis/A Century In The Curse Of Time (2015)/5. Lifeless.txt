We re lifeless it's so real
Seems so fake but we can feel
Lifeless it's so real

When the coffins
Were unearthed from soil
And all grief, and all woe
Has no place left to boil
That's when the land was overrun
By plants and factory scenes
And all the crafts got dry cleaned

A shadow once nobody owned
Now industrialists wear
The serfage's crown
While the gear wheels won't hold
Not a second a day
And sunlight just can't find a way

We re lifeless it's so real
Seems so fake but we can feel
Lifeless it's so real

All the farmhands
Turned to work machines
Maximizing revenues
On a scale so obscene
Flocks of humans its insane
Like the moth and the flame
Our new society's war game

In god they trust
But all others pay cash
Kids of seven years
Contribute to success
Competition brings out
The best in profit
And the worst in people
That's not what we consider equal

We re lifeless it's so real
Seems so fake but we can feel
Lifeless it's so real
