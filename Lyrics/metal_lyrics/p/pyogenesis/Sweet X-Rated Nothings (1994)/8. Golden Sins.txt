Close my eyes and take control
Over my body and my soul
Two shiny rivers four eyes of gold
Can't compare between young and old

Come on baby do your job
Burn me make me really hot
I'm the incredible T-i-m
No.1 no bitches fan

Golden sins

Now I'm here - damned to choose
Which one of you can I loose?
A hammer's pounding in my head
Oh yeah I'm better off dead

Possessed by the agony of love
The gray one, that's my dove
I weep to the forbidden sky
Is love only a lie?

I'm flyin' over you and nothing is to do
No reality in my dreams and all is like it seems
The black unholy sky - no way no need to cry
Lost in senseless dreams and all is like it seems
