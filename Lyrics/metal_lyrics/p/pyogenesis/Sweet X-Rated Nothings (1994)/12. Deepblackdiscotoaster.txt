["Sweet X-Rated Nothings/Waves Of Erotasia" edition bonus track]

Inside out you can't break fear without a doubt
Inside out you can't break fear for sure

I still remember the days when you were gone
The days of a perfect life
We had so much abstract fun

Inside out you can't break fear without a doubt
Inside out you can't break fear for sure

You never hide your inter fear inside
The way things are so far
So god-damned far

Inside out you can't break fear without a doubt
Inside out you can't break fear for sure
