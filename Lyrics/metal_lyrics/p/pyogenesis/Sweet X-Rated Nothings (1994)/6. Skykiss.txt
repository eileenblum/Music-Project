Kiss you for the first time
Smooth caressing without fear
Drink from the wine of lust
Salty like a hopeless tear

Skykiss - take this
Skykiss - take my soul

I'm runnin' in your arms
And in your heart
Take this piece of hell
This soul is to sell

Over all I'm traveling in my mind
It cuts you like a knife
In these days I know I'll find
Oh let me fly so high
State of affairs seems so strange
The darkened dawning nears
Now my life starts rearranged
And eyes no longer see

Blood red tender touch
Blow the godly horn tonight
Delicious taste of female things
Like a feast for weekend kings
