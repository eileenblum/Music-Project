Complete your misery to dwell in sin and despair
A mortal affair to humiliate their minds
Now I'll search for the meaning of my life
Can I influence my way?

And again... and again I will search
For the healing shore
And again... and again... and again
I'm looking for...

It's the way of the world
And life goes on
Healing tears and faith so strong
Be your god, your master
Rule you fuckin' world

As the wind kisses my skin and touches my hair
The mortal affair to humiliate my mind
Now I'll search for the meaning of my life
I can influence my way

Childish emotions for you don't be ashamed
Give peace in strong hands
The ones which are maimed

And again... and again I will search
For the healing shore
And again... and again... and again
I'm looking for...

It's the way of the world
And life goes on
Healing tears and faith so strong
Be your god, your master
Rule your fuckin' world
