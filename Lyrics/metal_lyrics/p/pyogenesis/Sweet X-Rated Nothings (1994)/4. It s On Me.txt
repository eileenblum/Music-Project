I'm lying motionless among
The onlookers at the shore
Eternity fills my heart -
Expectations starve

Now it's on me, it's on me, it's on me
When I try to understand
It's on me, it's on me, it's on me -
It's on me now

The mood is pregnant - the air begins
To melt - the aim of life is so unreal
I feel so sad inside my heart
I feel so sad inside my soul

Now it's on me, it's on me -
When I try to understand
It's on me, it's on me, it's on me
It's on me now
