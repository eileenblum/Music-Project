Amorphous reflections
On the snow covered ground
Weeping so silent like roses, like blood

Tears crawling and creeping
Down my cheer
A sign of the winter
Unearthly cries

Diving extasis - yeah get this
This godly extasis for you
Diving extasis - through your kiss

Tree's so white so dumb
So lost like myself
I look in a frozen mirror
I see what I am

Still drowning in blood
Of my enemies
Which I teared in half

No body reflections
Dead muscles and nerves
Another delivered corpse
Of our civilization

Diving extasis - yeah get this
This godly extasis for you
Diving extasis - through your kiss
