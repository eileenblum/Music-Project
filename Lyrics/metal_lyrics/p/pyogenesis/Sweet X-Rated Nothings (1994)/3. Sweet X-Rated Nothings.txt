Wrapped in the tight warmth of her hands
I fell her sucking kiss
With the tender friction of her skin
She makes me hot
One wild touch, the one I need so much
You're eternally, eternally mine

Heavenly melodies from the velvet seas
Of my dream paradise
Fountains of lust, beautiful sound
Between our hearts an eternal bound
Ordinary life is nothing for me
I use the summit of pleasure
As you can see

Caresses so hot, kisses so sweet
I can's stand, can't stand the heat
Splendour, glamour, shiny gown
Eternally, eternally, you're my own

Hey, hear what I say I'm here for you today
Take this rose my dear, but never, never
Let her sear
Take this peace of mind the sweetest kiss
You ever find
Your seal, my treasure, purest love
Purest pleasure

Here she goes...

Sweet, sweet X-rated nothings

In ecstasy she asks for more
She's insatiable to the core
The symbol of love I wish to see
Down on my knees - I'm dying
