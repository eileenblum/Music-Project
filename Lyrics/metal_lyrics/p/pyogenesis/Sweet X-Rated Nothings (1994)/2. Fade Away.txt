Is this godless pleasure real,
Or is it holy what I feel?
Am I lusting for the sky,
Like a useless bitter cry?

And you shall turn my eyes into tears
Each dying dream I have to fear
But now I'm here to take a stand
I've got you mind in my hand!!!

Fade away... my love

Red tears caress human things
And the clock of hate fuckin' rings
You will bleed, yes you do
And everything is fuckin' new

And you shall turn my eyes into tears
Each dying dream I have to fear
But now I'm here to take a stand
I've got you mind in my hand!!!

No compromise in what I do
Rub your face in shit - ain't that cool?
We were used to be friends
This love fades away and friendship ends

And you shall turn my eyes into tears
Each dying dream I have to fear
But now I'm here to take a stand
I've got your mind in my hand!!!

Fade away... my love

This one is for the horny little girls
Please put you fingers in your anal cunt

What you say... what you do...
Everything is so fucking new
No heart in your cave
Go to sleep in your grave

And you shall turn...
