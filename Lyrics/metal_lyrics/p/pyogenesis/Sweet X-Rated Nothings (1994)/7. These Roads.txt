I hope these times carry on. No!
I'm even sure that they will
I dreamed the dreams of anxiety
Now I know, they'll never fulfill

Can't enter these roads again - no no no no no
Can't enter these roads - Can't enter these roads
Can't enter these roads again - now I know
Can't enter these roads

Now I changed my attitude
Not certain - but I did
"Yes or no" is no compromise
It seems like I've to quit
