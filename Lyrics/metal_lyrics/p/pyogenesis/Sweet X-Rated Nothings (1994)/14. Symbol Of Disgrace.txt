["Sweet X-Rated Nothings/Waves Of Erotasia" edition bonus track]

Oh please, would you lead me
Through the stream of my lost memory

The days are needed, you're by my side
When I was too blind to see your light

Symbol of disgrace
For whom I was born, for whom I will burn
I've been damned since I was born

Please lead me through your memories
Symbol of disgrace
