[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: T. Eiermann]

Hold you close but you can't feel
What it means to be inside
And I feel: Tension pull me down!
Pull me down! Down and out.

I hate to say and I can't stand
Things get out of hand

Will it ever be
Will it ever be the way it used to be
I don't know
Will it ever be the way it used to be

Confirm my will
I watched you turn the other way
Just some words for you
Some words for you my friend

I hate to say and I can't stand
Things get out of hand

Will it ever be
Will it ever be the way it used to be
I don't know
Will it ever be the way it used to be
