[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

We were talking about our lives
We were talking about everything
Still we had the same drives
To prove, stand still and to spin

But sweet black emotions, darling
Let us drift far away
When we want to end up sober,
trying not to be unfair, anywhere

I remember you - the spirit's all around
I remember you - the spirit's all around

Quest for drives, quest for us two
Quest for honestly everything
Not the same as it used to
Be whatever you want

But sweet black emotions, darling
Let us drift far away
When we want to end up sober,
trying not to be unfair, anywhere

I remember you - the spirit's all around
I remember you - the spirit's all around
