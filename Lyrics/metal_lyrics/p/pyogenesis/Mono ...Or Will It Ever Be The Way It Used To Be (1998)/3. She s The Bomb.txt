[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: T. Eiermann]

I'm wishing for the rain to come
Don't waste our time, too much to say
Oh, I'm so tired ,can't overlook
The way you sometimes act

[1CH.:]
Baby, rock me, don't be lazy
I really hope you will 'coz I need the thrill
My lady-she's the bomb

Right here, right now I like it raw
I'd like to burn it. Yes I want more
A shameless lady, friend or foe
Too high to touch me low

[1CH.:]
Baby, rock me, don't be lazy
I really hope you will 'coz I need the thrill
My lady-she's the bomb
[2CH.:]
Du dub dub dub dub
Du dub dub dub dub
Du dub dub dub dub doe

I will let you down today
Please let me help to find your way
A shameless lady, friend or foe
Too high to touch me low

[1CH.:]
Baby, rock me, don't be lazy
I really hope you will 'coz I need the thrill
My lady-she's the bomb
[2CH.:]
Du dub dub dub dub
Du dub dub dub dub
Du dub dub dub dub doe
