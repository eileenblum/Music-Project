Leaving me without a trace
You couldn't see my weeping face
I would call this real unfair
That's when you were gone somewhere

For what seems real - we try to heal
Now what's the point and what's the deal
A big impact - the way you act
That's what I hate -you were so fake

[CH.:]
Fake it.Fake it. Don't you have to
Fake it.Fake it. Don't you have to

Well,I know it seems delayed
That I'm facing me betrayed
I would call this real unfair
That's when you were going somewhere

What's inbetween you haven't seen
You don't know how it's been
A big impact -the way you act
That's what I hate -you were so fake

[CH.:]
Fake it.Fake it. Don't you have to
Fake it.Fake it. Don't you have to
