[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: T. Eiermann]

So much to say, so much would last for years
May be an answer could dry my mourning tears
Do you feel lost a million miles from home?
Do you have a place to go? Any peaceful place to go?

[PreCH.:]
Yeah, I remember you I always do
Too sweet to let you go
Can't hide my feelings, no
These words I wrote, I wrote for you
This song goes out to you

[CH.:]
Could you dry my saline eyes
Hopeful tears of care
I know - sometime we'll meet again
In Paradise, I swear

So hard to understand these doubtfull ways of God
Where's the answer to the question
I've never known Who answers me? And whom should I
believe?
Do we have a place to stay? Any peaceful place to stay?

[PreCH.:]
Yeah, I remember you I always do
Too sweet to let you go
Can't hide my feelings, no
These words I wrote, I wrote for you
This song goes out to you

[CH.:]
Could you dry my saline eyes
Hopeful tears of care
I know - sometime we'll meet again
In Paradise, I swear
