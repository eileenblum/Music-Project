[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Taking me into the sky
I'll try to hold my hands up high
Isn't that what you said I've forgotten?
Everything seems clear, everything so real
Everything's so overwhelming,don't you know
This is what they say
that's what they say that's what they say

[CH.:]
You drive me down, down, down
And you 're dragging me around, and round
You're not gonna take good care of me
You 're not gonna do it defenitely
You drive me down

Searching for a second way
Another day I'll try to stay
You don't really what I've been trying
Everything seems clear ,everything so real
Everything's so overwhelming,don't you know
This is what they say
that's what they say that's what they say

[CH.:]
You drive me down, down, down
And you 're dragging me around, and round
You're not gonna take good care of me
You 're not gonna do it defenitely
You drive me down
