[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

I've got to go - I've got to care
You 've got to know - You 've got to share
You wanted me to stand behind
I didn't want to be unkind
When I was fair - you try to cheat
Don't give me back that real hot heat
You 're not the one I wanna be
The one who suffers endlessly

[CH.:]
You wanna push me back
Who the hell d'you think you are, now

No need to think you were the last
No need to sink into the past
You weren't trying to prove some things
But you were lying to be the king
When I was fair - you try to cheat
Don't give me back that real hot heat
You're not the one I wanna be
The one who suffers endlessly

[CH.:]
You wanna push me back
Who the hell d'you think you are, now
