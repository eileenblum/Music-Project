[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: T. Eiermann]

Underneath the open sky
Hypnotize the needs
And this is it, A little bit,
Of mine you have to feed
Begging 'please give me some more'
Anything you have....
Suddenly the suffering
smacked me up again

[PreCH.:]
She's the One She's the One

The thing that holds my hand again
Tears me now apart
Now we'll see what time will bring
It's what I'll hate the most
I'm so cold can taste the fear
Caressing the old
Suddenly the suffering
smacked me up again

[PreCH.:]
She's the One She's the One

[CH.:]
Begging 'please give me some more'
All the things I need
Anything you have to give
May be all your dreams

Let me give you what you need
Satisfy your needs
Drowning here in emptiness
No, you'll never bleed
I said, come and you should feel
Everything you feel is real
This damn hidden thing
Holds you up again

[PreCH.:]
She's the One She's the One

[CH.:]
Begging 'please give me some more'
All the things I need
Anything you have to give
May be all your dreams
I'm so deep in you my dear
Touching streams so low
Suddenly the hidden thing
smacked me up again
