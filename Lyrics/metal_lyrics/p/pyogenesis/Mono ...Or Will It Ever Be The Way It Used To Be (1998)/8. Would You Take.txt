[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

You know what's in between, what you've ever seen
I show my innerself, show what I've always been
You'll crash down don't you, break me right in two
Break my confidence apart, yes you'll do

I'll break down once more, I'll break you to the core
Now I know you cannot break my will to check old and
more
Other's stolen things will borrow other wings
And everything and everyone would take good care

Would you take, would you take, would you take it away
Would you take it away, they cannot do what's up to you

You'll find me everywhere I'll better take good care
You wouldn't know no need to show that would be fair
You'll crash down don't you break me right in two
Break my confidence apart yes you'll do
Here I go again nothing's still the same
I thought to keep in mind the latest news and what you
said
Open that door see the second shore
And Everything and everyone would take good care

Would you take, would you take, would you take it away
Would you take it away, they cannot do what's up to you
