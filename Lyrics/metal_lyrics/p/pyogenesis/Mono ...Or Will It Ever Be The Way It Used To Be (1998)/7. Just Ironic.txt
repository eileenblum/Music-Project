[Music: Flo V. Schwarz, T. Eiermann &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: T. Eiermann]

I'm gaining - no one can bring me down
I'm not feeling blue - feels good inside
Just believe in me like I believe in you

It's getting better - I can soar so high
Everything's so fine - It's the time of my life
Just ironic - everything's so fine
Just Ironic lyrics

Bad times came and they went away
Happiness - that's easy to find
Everyone around is blessed with an open mind

It's getting better - I can soar so high
Everything's so fine - It's the time of my life
Just ironic - everything's so fine
Just Ironic lyrics
Just ironic, just ironic, just ironic lyrics
Just ironic - everything's so fine
Just ironic - and it's the time of my life
Just ironic - and everything's so fine
Just Ironic lyrics
