[DIGI Bonus]

Yes I've learned this from you my dear 
How it should be and what can I say 
I want it all what I've never got 
It's all ok, yeah it's not so bad 
It comes now 

It's ok, it's ok, everything's ok 
What can I say about the day 
It's ok, it's ok, everything's ok 
Every day the same old story 

I've never said I'm tough enough 
On rainy days, low depressive mood 
And I know, you don't mind, 
you don't care at all 
Like the way you talked before 
nearly rotten to the core 
It comes now 

It's ok, it's ok, everything's ok 
What can I say about the day 
It's ok, it's ok, everything's ok 
Every day the same old story 

You wanted me and you got my butt, baby 
You couldn't see any gutters shut, baby 
You wanted all and you got my money 
You are my sweetheart, you are my honey 
It comes now 

It's ok, it's ok, everything's ok 
What can I say about the day 
It's ok, it's ok, everything's ok 
Every day the same old story
