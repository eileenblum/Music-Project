Destruction of holy life
Army of the undead arrives
Pounding legions of satan
Irresolute massacre

Rise of the unholy-arrival of the beast
Rise of the unholy-my immortal hate
Rise of the unholy-a demons raging cry
Rise of the unholy-the kabandha

Darkened burning sea of blood covered the earth
Thousands of ripped cadavers protect the ground
A iceberg of frozen carcasses stands loathsome to the sky
Unholy oath of darkness-death to you

Rise of the unholy-ritual to the gods
On the seventh night this virgin born
Thousands of mengeled angels-from they are fallen
Divine incest-huang-fei-hu

Ripped virgin nailed on a cross
Leviathans throne the sword in his fist

Up to the circles down to the unholy pit
A ritual for satan-pouring blood

Destruction of holy life
Army of the undead arrives
Pounding legions of satan
Irresolute massacre
Ripped virgin nailed on a cross
Her destination-the holiest tomb

Up to the immortals (born to suck out your life)
Haunting cry of the devil
Bloody clouds on the sky

Darkened burning sea of blood covered the earth
Thousands of ripped cadavers protect the ground
A iceberg of frozen carcasses stands loathsome to the sky
Unholy oath of darkness-death to you
