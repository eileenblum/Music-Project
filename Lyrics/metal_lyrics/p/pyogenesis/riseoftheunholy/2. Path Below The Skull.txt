Path below the skull ancient ways before me
Insomnia plagues the subconcious

Sweat covers the face tears crawling down the skin
Now your face is lacquered by the acid rain

Burstout in tears (slave to myself) condemned by madness
Path below the skull

Burstout in tears (slave to myself) condemned by madness
Path below the skull

Horrified situations apart from my decisions
Like a mortician it lefts tremendous fear

The wild version (iz cleans the soul) earth of fire
Son of weakness.... skull
The black moon shines in the red sea (lake of blood)
Soul of a rotting christ

Burstout in tears (slave to myself) condemned by madness
Path below the skull
