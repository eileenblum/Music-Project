[Music: Flo V. Schwarz / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

You wanted friends you wanted somebody
Who needs a home who needs infinity
But you should know that something happened,
Something changed so far,
Something's not the same
That there's some more but only getting high
They should change their mind

Love nation sugarhead, love nation sugarhead
Just wind it up with some E and some space bread
Love nation sugarhead, love nation sugarhead
Don't you break down in a love nation sugarhead

You're gonna stay, you're gonna leave, somehow
Who stabs himself, who stabs a needle, now?
When time has come to find the meaning of behaviour
To make it out and stand
For their opinion
That should not remain,
They should change their mind

Love nation sugarhead, love nation sugarhead
Just wind it up with some E and some space bread
Love nation sugarhead, love nation sugarhead
Don't you break down in a love nation sugarhead
