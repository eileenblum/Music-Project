[Music: R. SchÃ¦nsee &amp; W. Maier / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Did you see those mushrooms there
I'd like to show to you
Did you smell them in the air
I'd like to go with you
It's just a matter of expression how
You achive your aim
How you get paid by her reaction
Try it once more

What you see is what you get - Blue Smiley's plan
Don't care about who's in that bed - Blue Smiley's plan
Seeing is believing, babe - Blue Smiley's plan
Don't care about who's in that bed - Blue Smiley's plan

He's in touch just with some girl
Don't know weach other well
Try to tell her everything
She won't believe you now
It's just a matter of expression how
You achive your aim
How you get paid by her reaction
Try it once more

What you see is what you get - Blue Smiley's plan
Don't care about who's in that bed - Blue Smiley's plan
Seeing is believing, babe - Blue Smiley's plan
Don't care about who's in that bed - Blue Smiley's plan
