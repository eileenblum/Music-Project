[Music: Flo V. Schwarz / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Starring at the seas of time,
I see some memories in my mind
Waiting for the call to leave
this happiness, this happiness all day

Disgust me, distrust me
My own rhapsodie in E
Believe me, decease me
My own rhapsodie in E

Hide myself so crude in dope
Got no more help got no more hope
Final kick smashed me away
Now I'm tied up - got something old to pay

Disgust me, distrust me
My own rhapsodie in E
Believe me, decease me
My own rhapsodie in E
