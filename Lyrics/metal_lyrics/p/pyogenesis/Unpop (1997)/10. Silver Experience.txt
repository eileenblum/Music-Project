[Music: Flo V. Schwarz / Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

You're gonna take it gonna tear it apart
Silver experience take it out of my heart
You're gonna move it gonna make it today
(Silver, silver, silver experience)
Silver experience tell me why can?t you stay
(Silver, silver experience)

I don't know, I don't care
You just should do what you dare
What a henchman wouldn't try out (try it anyway)
Turn it on, turn it loose, fuzzy riot stranger blues
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

You're gonna take it gonna tear it apart
Silver experience take it out of my heart
You're gonna move it gonna make it today
(Silver, silver, silver experience)
Silver experience tell me why can't you stay
(Silver, silver experience)

Cut up one, cut and gone
Major thing's already done
By a stump link stinky bass man (holy deep inside)
Well he's right, well he's tight, well, he gave us a new
sight
Of what he knows, I don't know, I don't know

You're gonna take it gonna tear it apart
Silver experience take it out of my heart
You're gonna move it gonna make it today
(Silver, silver, silver experience)
Silver experience tell me why can't you stay
(Silver, silver experience)
