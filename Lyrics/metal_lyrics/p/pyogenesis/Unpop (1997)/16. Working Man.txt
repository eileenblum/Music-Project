[bonus track]

Looking through my window
what I can see it's still
nothing changes anymore
but I can see it's still the world!

Live in pleasure
Hidden treasure
There`s no measure
only pressure

...the working man...

World dignity is broken
we've come to nothing
but you come see it's still
the world!

Live in pleasure
Hidden trasure
There's no leisure
Only pressure

... the working man...
