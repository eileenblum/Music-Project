[Music: Asmodeus &amp; Schwarz / Lyrics: Asmodeus &amp; Schwarz]

I don't trust the things you said to me
They can't be true
I don't trust your hands they're burning me
Burning me, burning me
Yeah it's true and I go
Why did you betray
For me there's no need to stay

At the flames
When I hear you calling my name
And it's always the same
When I hear you calling my name
At the flames

At the flames
When I hear you calling my name
And it's always the same
When I hear you calling my name
At the flames

[Repeat]

In sadness I well dwell
Indestrucitble hell

At the flames
I'm leaning on her grave
no tears I feel so save
When I'm leaning on her grave
At the flames
At the flames
I don't hear her calling my name
Never more it is the same
I don't hear her calling my name
At the flames
