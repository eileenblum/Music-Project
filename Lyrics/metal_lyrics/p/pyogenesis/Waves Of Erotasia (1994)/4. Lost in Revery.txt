[Music: Schwarz / Lyrics: Scwarz]
[Lead vocals by Schwarz]

The time
Time has come to leave the scene
I wonder why you've changed those things
To everlusting pride
Do you still remember me
Once I was a beggar, now look at me
I am somebody else

No interruption
We're just lost in revery
Like in unconciousnes
We dream the dreams of agony
No interruption
We're just lost in revery
Like a beggar .....
... we dream the dreams of misery
