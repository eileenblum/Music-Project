[Music: Schwarz &amp; Asmodeus / Lyrics: Asmodeus]

In the end all is forgiven and the agony ends
Is heaven calling

Your life has ceased - And your life has ceased
Und dein Leben ist vorbei - Und dein Leben ist vorbei
Et la vie et finie - Et la vie et finie
In the end your life has ceased
and all is gone

In the end no one will win, laughter dies, freedoms rise
The speech is lugbrious - filled with lies
The sprightly way of life us squandered by you
Quintessential sad - myth of the dead

Cries of the unborn clouds
A season of my inner functions
Orgasms are leaving the gates
Of my errected body

Break the barrier to the light
From the dead to the living
Ancient lands I'll see
In my eternal sleep

Your life has ceased - And your life has ceased
Und dein Leben ist vorbei - Und dein Leben ist vorbei
Et la vie et finie - Et la vie et finie
In the end your life has ceased
and all is gone
