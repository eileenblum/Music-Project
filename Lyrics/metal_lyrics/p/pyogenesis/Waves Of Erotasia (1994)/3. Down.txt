[Music: Schwarz / Lyrics: Asmodeus]

Oh, my beauty - I hear your golden weeping
As I fly the skies of thousand wishes
I'm hunting you like a hunter huntes victims
And I hope that I will catch you

Send me down, down to the earth
Please bring me down, down on my knees
Please send me down, down to earth
Please bring me down, down on my knees

You, my fortress of emotions
Heritage of love is on the way
I want and I need your blood, your warmth
My heart is beating for you

Lord send me down, down to the earth
Please bring me down, down on my knees
Please send me down, down to earth
Please bring me down, down on my knees

Die Liebe, die lust, der schmerz
L'amour, l'envie, et la douleur
El amor, la gana, el dolor
