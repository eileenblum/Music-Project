[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Whenever I'll pass away
even if it hurts
I wish that all my friends'd die
we would hear the birds
March up to heaven's front door
which is all locked up
We'd kindly ask for entrance
AND THE ANGELS WELCOME US
I'd ask if we could stay here 
just a little while
One angel would come closer
and answer by my side:
"Eternity's forever 
you certainly can trust"
Respectfully I'd mention
THAT THE ANGELS WELCOME US
Angels welcome us
At the heavens gate they will wait
Angels welcome us
End of all days no one stays
Politely we'd salute them
and take that 1st small step
even if we know that
to enter means we're dead
I'd come up full of wonder
what an angel does
He asks me what I'd expect
"THAT THE ANGELS WELCOME US"
"I'd like to have a room with
panoramic view"
He answeres that they don't have
and why we'd need it, too
I quickly reply "sleeping"
and he that no one does
"And now that you are angels
YOU ARE ONE OF US"
Angels welcome us
At the heavens gate they will wait
Angels welcome us
End of all days no one stays
