[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

When you're trying to be special
And you play an instrument
In your band
And the goals you have get higher
And you know you'll reach them all
In your band
And the kids at school they fool you
Just because you love your band
Love your band
And one day, you can believe me
They will tell they were a friend
Of your band
No no no. You and you band, you and you band
No no no. You and you band, you and you band
Two years later there's a contract 
Of a company that counts 
On you band
Then you'll tour with one of your faves
And they're friendly and respectfull
To your band
Now you will know that no longer
people rate you as a person
But your band
At least now my friend, that's certain
You will understand 
Other bands
No no no. You and you band, you and you band
No no no. You and you band, you and you band
