[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Punk Rock girls forever
She says Punk Rock is her life
And that she'll never turn away from these days
Punk Rock is her life
She puts on her favourites
God bless Joey Ramone
Doughboys and Dag Nasty
she knows every single tone
Punk Rock girls forever
She says Punk Rock is her life
She says she can't imagine quit this life style
Punk Rock is her life
Punk Rock girls forever
She says Punk Rock is her life
She says she can't imagine quit this life style
Punk Rock is her life
