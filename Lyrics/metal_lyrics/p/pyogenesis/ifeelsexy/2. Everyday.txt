[Music &amp; Lyrics: Flo V. Schwarz]

Every morning, every day
Same old patterns, what you say
No more challange, no more hypes
Live your life in stereotypes
Live your life, it is your your last
There's no future, there's just past
Don't you miss some special things
like a choir and that sings
We're living together, we're living in pain
We're working forever, that drives me insane
I've been wise, I've been cool,
Compromise - oh damn you'll 
get along with the past
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, 
everyday, everyday could be the last.
Forgotten soldiers - ancient tales
Everything counts at least what sells
No more challange, no more hypes
Live your life in stereotypes
Live your life, it is your your last
There's no future, there's just past
Don't you miss some special things
like a choir and that sings
We're living together, we're living in pain
We're working forever, that drives me insane
I've been wise, I've been cool,
Compromise - oh damn you'll 
get along with the past
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, 
everyday, everyday could be the last.
