sweet smell of death
enter my focusil?
and keep me focused you're soon to be
another layer of blood to
paint my walls splatter scene

god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it
god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it

bash your face in grit my teeth in anger
i need you prepped for murder
stick my cock in the sight of your disfigured
face makes nie ctun with ease

god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it
god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it

lick your face clean
i have to taste your blood before you die
i bite random holes in your neck
face, and breasts and swollow the fiesh

god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it
god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it

grisly, ghastly my chamber of pain and death
a sanctuary to sne serenity provided to me
from che countless lives i've claimed

god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it
god im fucking insane
god i fucking love it

the gurgling of blood is music to my ears
sends shivers down my spine gasping
for air it's plain to see misery has found you

you didn't stand a chance whore
your death came so easily to nie
i strangled you with my bare hands
for intimacy you can never leave me

my sickness since its infantcy
has never really bothered me
when i apply thought to action
it sends me reeling one woman
fell and then another so on and so
forth rapidly increasing victims
with time
