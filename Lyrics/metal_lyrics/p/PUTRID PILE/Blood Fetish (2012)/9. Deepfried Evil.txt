I devour haggis, cos haggis is yummy
some deep fried evil yummy yummy haggis in my tummy
it's lungs, its heart, edible diseas
you grab your left arm as you fall to your knees yum!

yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum
rectal exhale from my bum bum
yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum
thoughts of dead meat makes me cum!

haggis haggis
it's brains and hacked up bits of liver
haggis haggis
these vital organs make me quiver

freedom
from healthy living
freedom
to jab at will
free from
the words of boba
freedom to be eaten
alive at mr. crowleys house

at mr. crowleys house!!!
