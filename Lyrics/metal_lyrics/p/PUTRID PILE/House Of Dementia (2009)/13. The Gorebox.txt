Deep in the bowels of my basement.
There sits a box of goodies that excites me.
Filled up with putrid gore.
Body parts of the young and old alike.
Festering right here before me.
I murder with my conscious clear.
Soaking in the pluck of humans.
Up to my neck.
Livers, kidneys, lungs, and intestines.
Just to name a few.
Naked and standing at full mast.
Aroused.
Slamming my cock viciously spewing semen ecstasy.
Praise my gore box.
When all my victims have succumbed to my rage.
They're prepared for amateur dissection.
Their ribcage meets my bone saw.
Bones crack as I expose their innards, so inviting.
No need for gloves.
Fondle their bloody organs.
Can't ignore the madness that saturates me.
When I bathe in innards, the lion's subdued.
The stench of the virtuous ascends to my nostrils.
Triggering reminiscent thoughts of when I made them pule.
Why do these morbid deeds you ask?
Could I have been abandoned as a child?
Or maybe beaten to a bloody pulp?
It could be a million scenarios.
Maybe I just like the power of death.
To see my victims paralyzed with fear.
Control of their fate.
I just love to watch them die.
