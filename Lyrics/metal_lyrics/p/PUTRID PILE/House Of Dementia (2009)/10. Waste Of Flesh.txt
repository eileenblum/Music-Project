Such a sweet succulent neck.
Oh how nice it looks when my blade pierces and cuts.
Your blood spills on the floor, my cock at attention.
I'm doing the world a favor by killing you.
My eyes gleam with your suffering.
Your life has been wiped away.
Prepared to kill by any means.
Dirty rotten filthy whore.
You were beautiful before, you're even more beautiful now.
Pale with no color, the way it has to be.
Your neck and chest are stained with blood.
The frozen look of fright is on your face.
Unbuckle my belt, squeezing your breasts. 
You know what's next you dirty little whore.
My cock yearns for you, throbbing as hard as it can be.
Slamming my rod in the driest of cunts.
The way it has to be.
This is your reality.
I gently stroke the laceration on your neck.
I can't keep from ramming my cock inside.
I've sucked my bloody fingers clean, I explode.
They'll never forget the atrocities that happened here.
When I'm dead and gone.
The atrocities that happened here.
