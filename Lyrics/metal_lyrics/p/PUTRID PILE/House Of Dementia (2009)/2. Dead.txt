Your life's at a standstillDwelling in a pit of anticipationSob to ease the painIt distracts you from the thoughts of what can and will happen Knowing that you're going to die thrills meI unlock the door that suppresses desiresReleasing all the inhibitions that bind meBehold dementia You'll be gone from the world that you've infectedA virus coursing through the veins of societyI tel myself the world is better without youI do this to justify my deeds Knowing that you're going to die thrills meI unlock the door that suppresses desiresReleasing all the inhibitions that bind meBehold dementia The tears flowBeg for mercy I feel the hatred welling up inside meChurning my insidesDead is the man that I once wasA worthless pile of compassion There is no sanctuaryAs darkness descendsThe madness that was dormantRears its ugly head Knowing that you're going to die thrills meI unlock the door that suppresses desiresReleasing all the inhibitions that bind meBehold dementia You're caught in a whirlwind of painBeat the fucking teeth out of your pie-holeSecurity for when I shove my manhoodInside
