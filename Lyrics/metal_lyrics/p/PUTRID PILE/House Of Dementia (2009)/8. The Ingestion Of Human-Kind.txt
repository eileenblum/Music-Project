I'm raising the dead.
Children of the soil.
Meet your new life.
Feel your hunger grow.
Insatiable lust for human brains.
You're to roam the earth.
Killing off life.
This is my will.
Evil spells.
Chanted in the night.
I wake the dead.
Arise, the time has come.
The living shall suffer immensely.
Arise, the time has come.
The decimation of the earth.
Rotting skin and hunger for brains.
Drapes over the undead completely.
Servants of mine 'til the end of time.
Eager to do as I say.
The dead shall walk the earth.
Killing for me as they venture forth.
The dead shall walk the earth.
Starving for the taste of human flesh.
Wandering aimlessly.
All in their path shall fall.
Do my bidding, make haste!
For my throne is anxiously awaiting.
Eating death that once was life.
The taste of blood is all that they yearn for.
Vast numbers across the earth.
Shall be immolated for me.
They're taking your lives.
They're cleansing the earth.
I'm now crowned the king of all human kind.
My minions surpassed all expectations.
Following my every command.
They vowed for a life of servility.
An iron fist to rule the world.
Driven by my thirst for domination.
The end complete.
The final chapter in history.
