Your feet are tied behind your head.
Hands tied behind your back.
Raised up cock level, suspended by meat hooks.
I gaze into the mirror behind you to witness the blood trickle down.
Down to the floor.
Looking into my eyes you'll see the madness that hides behind.
My calm demeanor misleading.
Deep inside this mind of mine, you've already been hacked to bits.
I am your torture killer.
I am your torture killer.
Ravage your pussy, no limbs in my way to obstruct my path.
Vomit shoots through your ball-gag onto me.
Strangulation!
It's time to die!
I stop the air flow to your lungs.
I reap the seeds of hatred with my actions, my hands.
The tools of death, I squeeze tighter.
You die!!
I cum inside. 
Bloody knuckles, our foreplay has given me.
With your death, your memory remains in my conscious thoughts.
