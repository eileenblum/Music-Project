Pray for death!Backwoods electroshock therapy.Feet in a pail of water, wrists and ankles tied tight.Live wires released from my hands.Pray for death!Battered and bruised, dripping blood, you reek of urine.Electric death, my cock erect, suffer unto me.Pain is all you'll know.From here to eternity.What a silly fool I've been.How could I have killed you first?My cock makes me remember.It's standing at attention.Cut the torn shirt from your wrists and ankles.I prop you up on the back of the chair.Thrusting cock into crusty fucking slop hole.Take all of my semen, take it, take it, take it!Post coital satisfaction.I'm done with you, you're nothing.Bury you with all the others.A shallow grave is all you deserve.Gnawing, tearing, ripping at my mind.The urge to kill again has already set in.No one is safe from being placed in their grave!
