Suicide is for the weak
That's why I chose this way for you to die
You don't want
Me to be
Your killer
Your suffering would be what nightmares are made of
Tied up to my cross of death
Your hands free to cut your own wrists
Bleed out

Put on a morbid display for me
Front row to the show you see
Threats to rid yourself from the world
Have finally become reality

Put on a morbid display for me
Front row to the show you see
Threats to rid yourself from the world
Have finally become reality

Surprise
Before you die
Blunt force trauma to your skull
I bet you didn't see that coming
The most important home run of my life
Shit and piss splat on the floor
Expiration finally occurs
Time to bind your arms to the cross
Brutally tenderized
How will I keep from cumming?

The urge to see your guts
Infects my being
I can't hold back any longer
Hastily disemboweling your soulless carcass
Wrap the intestine 'round my neck (teradayctles)

Stroking the innards on my cock
Ecstasy, reality
Phallus thick, about to burst
It vomits cum repeatedly
Look at what you made me do
I've gone and dirtied my basement floor
You were nothing without me
A speck of dust is floating aimlessly in the wind

Sickening
Feeling
Vomit forth
Adrenaline
Trembling
Death is here
