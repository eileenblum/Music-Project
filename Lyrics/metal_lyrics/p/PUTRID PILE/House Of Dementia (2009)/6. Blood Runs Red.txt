Oral fixation!
The taste of pussy and blood is what I need.
Prep my knife, it's ready to spill your life fluid.
Hopes and dreams for the future shattered.
Stabbing viciously, to lubricate you see, penetration.
You piss on my face.
Trembling, frightened...poor you.
Poor you.
Blood runs red, dripping from my cock it keeps me hard.
I can't help, but fuck you again because you're unconscious from the pain.
A dead fuck is what you are now and not much has changed from the past.
No act of clemency, it keeps me aggressive for the future.
Dirty dog, you're not worth the leftovers you scavenge for.
To me, you deserve all your suffering.
Your genitals carved to shreds.
Mine sticky from the blood you've bled.
I bet in our next lives we'll meet again.
And you'll die as you did way back when.
