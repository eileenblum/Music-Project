Grinding and smashing and bashing and pulverizing
Pushing up daisies, fertilizer you'll be
Gashing and slashing to release your malice within
And brushing aside social conformity
I need to see the...

Blood exiting your body, staining your skin
A crimson work of art
I felt the need to portray your outsides as you've done my insides
Mangled, shredded, worthless and wretched
You should have been mindful of the way that you've treated me
Now your soul can wander aimlessly through eternity

Grinding and smashing and bashing and pulverizing
Pushing up daisies, fertilizer you'll be
Gashing and slashing to release your malice within
And brushing aside social conformity

Your "temple" has crumbled here before me
The burning flames that were your life
Extinguished

Grinding and smashing and bashing and pulverizing
Pushing up daisies, fertilizer you'll be
Gashing and slashing to release your malice within
And brushing aside social conformity
