When I wrap my hands around your neck I can feel your pulse weakening
Look deep into my eyes baby
The last thing you will see is a twinkle in my eyes
For soon you will expire prompting me to have my way with you

Feeling my love muscle rise... I soon will begin malicious deeds
Watching as you fade away... I have to accept what's come over me

I dominate
Taking control of your feeble state
Total control

I lay you on the ground to begin fucking your corpse rapidly
Beautiful to me... Ecstasy drapes over me
Pumping your fuck tunnel in and out and in and out and in
Rigor mortis tends to make this quite pleasurable

Feeling my love muscle rise... I soon will begin malicious deeds
Watching as you fade away... I have to accept what's come over me

I dominate
Taking control of your feeble state
Total control

With your death there is a calming... Feeling deep inside me
You'll never see the light of day... On this Earth again
I spew my semen into you
Balls deep right into your uterus
I thank you for giving me this gift of your death
This memory will stay with me for life

Not a soul will miss you dear
I have you tucked away in my crawl space forever
Your beauty is only bone deep anyway so believe me
You are better off here with me
Forever

Necro pack rat hoarding death!
