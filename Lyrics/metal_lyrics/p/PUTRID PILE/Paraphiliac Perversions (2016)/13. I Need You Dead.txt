Demon I am, the epitome of cruelty
Haggard and grotesque, my flesh permanently bloodstained
Killing season perpetual, let the blood flow
Thorough and meticulous, adherence to insanity

Idle hands
Nonexistent
Malcontent
I need more more more!

Victims to ease the pain of the torture that is within
Torture of a constant yearning for the deceased
Lady luck has smiled upon me
For she ensures a constant flow of degenerates for me

Idle hands
Nonexistent
Malcontent
I need more more more!

Die!
