Come here baby
Beautiful and pleasant to see
Bash your face in
Pummeling you is pastime to me
Battered bruised and bleeding
Pound the complaints out of you like a dog
You only deserve the best
Of what my fists have to offer

Replacing what was once fear
With unrelenting terror
Replacing what was once fear
Put you in an early...

Grave, your new home
Quiet just how you like it
The air no longer thick with tension
Why have I taken so long to grab hold of serenity in my life?
I should have killed you long ago

My only regret I'm facing now
Is not having you here with me
To beat you like the worthless fuck you are
My human stress reliever

I miss smashing you to and fro
