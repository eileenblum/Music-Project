Cunting fucking whore, God I hate your face
Contemptuous supreme
Beat you to a pulp, force feed fucking feces
Vomit on your face now
Scratching out your eyes, urine flows through me
Filling up the holes
Here to make you bleed, here to make you suffer
Here to make you die!
How it shall be...

Oh how I love to feel the power of control over you
My puppet to do as I wish... Existence obsolete
Torturous ways are the motivation for my satisfaction
Not enough methods on this Earth to cleanse your soul

Cunting fucking whore, God I hate your face
Contemptuous supreme
Beat you to a pulp, force feed fucking feces
Vomit on your face now
Scratching out your eyes, urine flows through me
Filling up the holes
Here to make you bleed, here to make you suffer
Here to make you die!
How it shall be...

Complete control is ultimately what has been achieved here
The breakdown of your ego crumbling rapidly, right where it belongs
You were born to suffer, you are here for me, you are here to die
A worthless piece of meat hanging from hooks and chains

It warms my heart to kill you and claim your life for my own
A sense of calm washes over me to see you suspended and mangled

Coming into my own, I like it, slow your body rots
Blood is dripping to the floor and I taste it... Exquisite
Collecting as much of your blood as I can to smear it on my body
Your sticky life fluid all over me makes me want to fuck

With my love shaft standing at attention I ram it in your vaginal cavity
Moans of pleasure and heavy breathing warm your cold dead face
You have no idea of the things that you've given me... I can't express it properly
Satisfaction a temporary veil of calm until murder beckons me again
