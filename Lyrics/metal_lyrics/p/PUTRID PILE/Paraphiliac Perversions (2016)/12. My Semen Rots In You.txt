I've been lurking for some time now
Persistent and cautious
I choose you to soon become a part of me
A constant fixture in my mind
The time is right I grab you from behind
These bushes a perfect cover
Strangulation... I squeeze the life out of you
Frantically remove your undergarments that keep me from you

Fucking you ferociously
Dead but my hands still choke
Eyes still open... Look at me
This cunt is mine!

Not bothered by the waste your body has released
Undeterred
It feels so good to finally have you
My semen rots with you

Not bothered by the waste your body has released
Undeterred
It feels so good to finally have you
My semen rots with you

Thank you for sharing this with me
This moment in time
Will forever stay with me
When I indulge in reminiscence
