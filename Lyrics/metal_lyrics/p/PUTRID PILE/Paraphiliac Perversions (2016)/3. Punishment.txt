Punishment is due, kneel before me
Daddy's little girl, princess to the world
Excitement flows through humiliation
I long for your demise

Begging and pleading for your life
Is what brings joy to me
Your tears flow graciously
I passionately wipe them away with my fists

Grab your ponytail, yank down firmly
Spit in your fucking face
Screaming the words of your future at you
Knowing me is murder for you

Killing you masks your imperfections
All I see... Blood!
My knife cuts... A smile from ear to ear
Gurgle sweet nothings to me

Now you lay dead before me
Your soulless body rots
