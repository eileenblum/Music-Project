A kiss can mean so many things
In this case it means your death
The darkest depths of my depravity
Only there can I truly see

Suffering for you has ended
A shell of your former self
Poison of the highest potency
You're relieved of your life...

Dirty play thing... You are for me
When I rub my cock on you I feel a surge of pleasure
Enchanted... Delighted
I keep your body moist with my semen

Suffering for you has ended
A shell of your former self
Poison of the highest potency
You're relieved of your life...

Suffering for you has ended
A shell of your former self
Poison of the highest potency
You're relieved of your life...

Ejaculate all of my woes
You're so sweet to me
You've given everything I need to me
Caressing you I melt into you

Served your purpose... Done
Inanimate
The way I need you
Good riddance
