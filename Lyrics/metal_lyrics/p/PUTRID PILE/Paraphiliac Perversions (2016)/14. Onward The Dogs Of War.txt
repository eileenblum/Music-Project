Because of me
The dead are piled up way up high to the sky
Because of me
Destiny
Death personified
Crushing all those who oppose the path I've chosen for you
River runs red
With the blood of the enemy
Your pride and dignity are washed away
The pleas to spare your lives all fall on deaf ears
And these roads we travel will be adorned with your impaled bodies

The high and mighty hand of doom
Pounding out inferiority
Their advancements futile
Incontrovertible - everyone dies!

What will become of my men and I?
Will we be crushed? Killed? Destroyed?
Fertilizer for the trees?
Meat for the vultures?
Rotting away in the hot sun?
The prophecy has been foretold
And it was told of our total and absolute victory
Victory over the vermin that plague these sacred lands
Torture and death commonplace in their lives
From now until forever
Their souls will be...

Ripped from their bodies
Screams of the dying sweet music to revel in
Oh the pleasure in separating heads from necks
Arms from torsos, legs from torsos
Effluence of blood
The fluid of life glistening in the summer sun
The stench of death peels away fear of war
Only to unveil excitement and enthusiasm

The high and mighty hand of doom
Pounding out inferiority
Their advancements futile
Incontrovertible - everyone dies!
