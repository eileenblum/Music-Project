The urge to dissect you has come over me
With you lying there so still
The autopsy table so clean and pristine
Is soon to hold a sight most grotesque

Preparation of my tools
Rubbing my genitals too
The utilization of tools
Let's begin
Carving you up pleases me

Rub my cock on the body parts scattered about
Will you let me cum for you my dear?

I can't hold it any longer
My affection spews all over you

A necrophilac's pastime
Formaldehyde absent
Rotten stench of death lingering
Insanity prevails
