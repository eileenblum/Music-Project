Come inside and make yourself at home
As you can see i've all the tools we need
Prepare yourself you can't imagine the horror
Nobody knows of the secrets that dwell within
Cut and rip and stab and tare
Enjoy the pleasure of death
Hang the bodies in the air
Gasping for their last breathe
Cup the blood into my hands
Wipe it all over my face
Cleanse the town of vermin whores, die
You thought you were safe
I confided in you stories from the past
Little did you know i confide in all of my victims
Die, die, die painting the wall with the blood
Of these whores
Painting the walls
With the blood of these whores
Satisfy me
Cut and rip and stab and tear
Enjoy the pleasure of death
Hang the bodies in the air
Gasping for their last breath
Cup the blood into my hands
Wipe it all over my face
Cleanse the town of vermin whores, die
Lacerated, covered in blood from head to toe
Objective complete
Another down so many to go
Hang lifelessly, remnants of insanity
