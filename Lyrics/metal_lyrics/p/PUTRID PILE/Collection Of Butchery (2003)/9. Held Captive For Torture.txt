Mercy is for the weak
Soon i will begin your demise
Caged up like a rat
Specimen for morbid acts
Waiting patiently
A far cry from when you arrived
Sleep now, you must rest
There's no way your god can save you
Death is certain
Wake up, time to die
Fulfill the pictures in my head
I smell your fear
Laughing as you piss yourself
Throw open the door, sodomizing innocence
Gnash my victims back
Psycho bliss euphoria
Consuming me
Shredding up my reasoning
Insanity
Watching as you bleed profusely
