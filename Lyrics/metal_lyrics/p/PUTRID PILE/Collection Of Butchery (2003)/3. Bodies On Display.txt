Impaled are those who are opposed to me
Shackled are those who are soon to be
Displays for all to see
In my kingdom of infamy
Striking fear into the heart of all
Expect no less then death
Reign of terror abysmal
Nobody here to stop me from the methods i condone
Stopping the seeds of treachery
Crush them before they grow
Conscience set aside, cross me and you will die
