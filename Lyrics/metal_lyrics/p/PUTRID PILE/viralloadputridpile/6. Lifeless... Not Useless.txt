[performed by Putrid Pile]Infanticide cast aside
Reeling from sickened
pleasures of adult flesh
Blood has been spilt
in the most nefarious of ways
To coat my member
Ready to invade
every inch of your inner workings
Sloppy guts so warm and inviting
Admire and rub and
poke the insides exposed before me
Lifeless......not useless
You're here to meet my needs
then you'll be discarded

Demon seed
Every piece of me
Hatred unleashed
Punishment
Sexual pincushion
In and out and in and out
No longer will I have to see
your wretched face

Dismember you
Slowly the saw cuts through your bones
The gritty sound flirts with my eardrums
To die is the only way to have truly lived
I know I will face no
repercussions for my actions

You started off
Very promising
You ended up
Deceased
