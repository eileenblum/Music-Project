Today is a perfect day for killing
Sharpen my machete so that it could split a hair
Use it on myself before the others
My blood runs red as my heart still pounds with excitement
Running through the streets - A madman
Hacking up everyone - In sight
Blood splattered on my - Face
I leave behind a trail of pain and misery
People scattering in every direction
Running for their lives
No lives within reach are spared
I've found a release to vent my hatred
Running through the streets - A madman
Hacking up everyone - In sight
Blood splattered on my - Face
I leave behind a trail of pain and misery
Death - Becomes them
Horror - Fills the streets
I have to make the most of my killing spree
Pressing on faster to cover more area
Motivated by the sound of people gagging on their own blood
I give new meaning to the term "paint the town red"
Running through the streets - A madman
Hacking up everyone - In sight
Blood splattered on my - Face
I leave behind a trail of pain and misery
