Gathering up all of my legions
With aspirations of world domination
The road ahead with be soaked with blood
All in our path will suffer greatly
The opposition will pay the price
They'll pay in full with their lives
Day in day out heads will roll
And they will be placed on pikes
The dogs of war have been released
We rape and pillage relentlessly
Death and destruction
Sweeps across the land as far as the eye can see
Dead bodies piled up to the sky
A putrid pile of rotting corpses
Dead bodies piled up to the sky
The pungent stench would bring any man to his knees
Piling up and burning all of the carcasses
Excluding no one
Victory is within our grasp
The opposition will pay the price
They'll pay in full with their lives
Day in day out heads will roll
And they will be placed on pikes
