Dead and rotting women's bodies read for consumption
Admiring what's soon to fill my belly
Ripe vaginas glistening in the light
Glistening 'cause they're covered with my semen
Feed the hunger - Gorging on labia
Rip the cunt lips right off of their bodies
Feed the hunger gorging on labia
Now you all are a part of me
Pile of rotting cunt lips collected on the floor
Time to kill the hunger pains inside me
Drop to my knees a blood mess
Eat away the decay to satisfy
Feed the hunger - Gorging on labia
Rip the cunt lips right off of their bodies
Feed the hunger gorging on labia
Now you all are a part of me
Reveling in sickness - It comforts me
Feasting on vaginas - Sweet substance
And what of the rest of them? A likely stew
And what of the rest of them? A stew for you!
Feed the hunger - Gorging on labia
Rip the cunt lips right off of their bodies
Feed the hunger gorging on labia
Now you all are a part of me
