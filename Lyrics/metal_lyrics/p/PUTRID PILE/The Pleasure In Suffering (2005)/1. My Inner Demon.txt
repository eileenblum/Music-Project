Consumed by madness
Pray on the innocent
Feed the demon deep inside me
Suffer the women and children
Suffer the men not fit to be
Blood to feed the hunger for death
Blood to ease the pain for my demon
Cut open the chest cavity with hedge clippers
Pull open the rib cage to expose what's inside of her
Feeling the texture of the lungs and heart tissue
Ripping them out to appease "him"
Blood to feed the hunger for death
Blood to ease the pain for my demon
The voice inside me
I'm suffering its consequence
Plagued by my actions forever
Heed the word of my master
I must do all that he tells me
Searching for more victims - Slaves for the afterlife
Searching for more victims - Anyone will suffice
Searching for more victims - With my mind infected
Searching for more victims - Feed the demon inside
Searching for more victims - Slaves for the afterlife
Searching for more victims - Anyone will suffice
Searching for more victims - With my mind infected
Searching for more victims - Feed the demon inside
Surrounded by mutilated bodies on the floor
Gnawing on a rancid piece of meat
My walls absorbed their tortured screams before they died
I piss on the chunks of human remnants
