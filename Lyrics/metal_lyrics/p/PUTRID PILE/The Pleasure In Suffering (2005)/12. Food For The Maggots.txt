Safe be the cover of darkness
Awaiting my next victim sure to fall by my hands
Soon to be asleep eternally
Oh how I love to spill the blood of the innocent
Shirt drenched with sweat from excitement
It's been awhile since my last couple made the papers
And the headline read, "Couple Found In Woods, Guts Exposed,
Parents Mourn"
They're food for the maggots!
They're food for the maggots!
Now I hear voices drawing near
If they only knew what was in store for them
Caught by surprise in the moonlight
Bludgeon him to death right in front of his sweetheart
Next I'll have my way with the Mrs.
You two have walked these woods in peril of your lives
Frozen from the shock of what just transpired
Strangling the life out of her
I need the woman dead to preform sodomy
They're food for the maggots!
They're food for the maggots!
With my hands around her neck - I fuck her asshole
Savagely thrusting in and out
Worthless - Only a piece of meat
Her ravaged rectum is still warm for me
You two have walked these woods in peril of your lives
Two more notches in my belt, pieces of shit
The maggots will feast on you for days
Days I'll take to plan my next attack
Now you both are dead
You're food for the maggots
Left to rot away
My cock dripping semen
The need to kill fulfilled
My suffering is done
