Our darkest fears

Steely fingers wrapped around my throat
Pulling me from my cocoon
The light envelops me but I am aware
I am lifted away
Leaving this world behind

Shadowy faces surrounding my body
As I am awoken
Foreign eyes peer into my head

Images painfully scar my mind in torture
Eagerly cutting into flesh and into bone
The secrets which were once hidden
The truth is now revealed for me to see
The human existence is damned

Meant for failure
Abandoned children
Lost and diseased
We have been cast aside
And watched from above

They will descend upon us all
For they are the true architects

Our darkest fears will arise on their brightest day
Total chaos
Cities lie in ruins
We will dissipate

Crushed into dust
Among the shadows

Lost colony of a failing race
Clinging on to the illusion of salvation
The stars have now turned against us
The lifeforms suspended above our broken planet
Hope no longer resides in the mysterious beyond
What were once dreams are now nightmares
We will learn our righteous place
For the creators have come to

Reclaim us
For we took whatâs rightfully theirs
Bringing us closer to the realization...
Of our darkest fears

As you close your eyes
I will sever your head from your body
