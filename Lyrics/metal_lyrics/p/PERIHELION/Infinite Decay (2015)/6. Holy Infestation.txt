Falsifying hopes, the premise of your demise
The disease of your collective mind
Has spread among your mindless followers
Evil and so contrived

The blood will pour like wine
Sacrificing your meaningless lives
Will be met with a vindictive vendetta
I assure you there is nothing waiting
For you above
Take this leap of faith
With nails dug into your feet
Bathe in the dirty birth water
From which you were conceived

Can you see whatâs holding you under?
Embrace this nightmare you have bestowed upon yourselves
Slaughtering the innocent in the name of your false prophet
Upon the crucifix you cower behind
Merciless, the abundant body parts string along

In this web you weave

Tasting flesh with the tongue
Which you speak of forgiveness
Forgive and forget as I bury you
Alive in the ground

Can you see whatâs holding you under?
Embrace this nightmare you have bestowed upon yourselves
Slaughtering the innocent in the name of your false prophet
Upon the crucifix you cower behind
Merciless, the abundant body parts string along

You try to speak out but no sounds come out
The sickly bile pouring out

From the mouths of the lifeless
But the scars still remain
Your Surrogate lord will not wash you of your sins
Stabbing you in the throat
With the rosary you wore around your neck
Depicted and hung for all to see

Falsifying hopes, the premise of your demise
The diseased tortured mind

Can you see whatâs holding you under?

Embrace this nightmare you have bestowed upon yourselves
Slaughtering the innocent in the name of your false prophet
Upon the crucifix you cower behind
Merciless, the abundant body parts string along
