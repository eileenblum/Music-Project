The painful voices
The screams turn to splinters
Shattering mirrors
My reflection grows bitter
I will rip out my fucking eyes to see clear

The lies, canât you see them?
Hidden in plain sight
The path before you is broken
Withering away
I stand before you
Open your eyes
Everything is connected to the bitter end.

Donât let the hate guide you
I promise I will stand by you [2x]

Stargazing below
The hopes and dreams above
Rip off this temporary bandage
Expose a cure
Embrace the dream of a new society.

Donât let the hate guide you
I promise I will stand by you [2x]

Take my hand
People of this planet unite
Spoken words of truth
Will you fucking hear me out?
We will no longer rest until we escape from this tyranny

Donât let the hate guide you
I promise I will stand by you
Donât let them take away your beauty
Stargazing below
I still have hope
We must fix what has been broken
The fate of the world is in our hands.
