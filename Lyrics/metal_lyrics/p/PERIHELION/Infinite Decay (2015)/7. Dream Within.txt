The wind carries me away
Setting my course back home
To the place I've always seen in my dreams
Bathed in beauty from the glow of the stars in the night sky
Where life is seen and felt differently

The trees whisper in harmony to my presence
The leaves twist and turn in its slumber
Itching to float.

I walk alone to find my own solace
I left my world behind me
Bring me back to the meadows
Where I roamed free

I hold my head up high
Nothing can hold me back
I left my fears behind me in the darkness
I move forward to the light which holds my destiny

Now treasuring the bliss of life
I was so ignorant to realize
My soul has opened
Flying free for all eternity

As I open my eyes
The bark rips away from the trees
The ashes fall unto the ground where I stand

Drifting into a void
I am falling forever
Suffocating in this rotted Eden

All thatâs left is a broken paradise
Corruption has left its everlasting touch
Dreary and bleak this world has become
Entombed in its suffering

With its last dying breath
The life that once kept me alive
Has now descended beneath my feet
I cry out to the night sky as it looms above
I feel despair grow within my breaking heart

I walk alone to find my own solace
I left my world behind me
Bring me back to the meadows
Where I roamed free

I hold my head up high
Nothing can hold me back
I left my fears behind me in the darkness
I move forward to the light which holds my destiny

Hopelessly digging through the dirt
The roots pull me into the soil
This reality sickens me
Iâm waiting to close my eyes!
