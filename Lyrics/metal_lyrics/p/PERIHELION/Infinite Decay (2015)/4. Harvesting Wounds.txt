This cold horizon overlooks
This miserable planet
Tormented and left to suffer
This world tears its self from inside out
Constricted with its umbilical cords
Your eyes roll back
As you drool from your worthless mouth

Bow before your true masters

The ugly truth dissected and stabbing in your eyes.
You have destroyed us all

Resistance is futile
The hate of the lost souls will feast
Upon your ripped open bodies.

Reap what you sow
This earth will have its revenge
Sick and disgusting we have raped this planet
This once peaceful paradise has become a fucking wasteland
The corroded stench of decomposing flesh
Will forever lie in its wake
Babbling in tongues your voice is severed
Swallowing and choking on your diseased blood
As your life force is ripped from you

Humanity will be conquered with its entrails
Leading into the inevitable
Global genocide
The plagues of all man
Will inherit the earth
The earth will harvest our wounds
Blossoming human tissue
Resistance is futile
The hate of the lost souls
Will feast upon your ripped open bodies

You have destroyed us all, you fucking murdered us [2x]
