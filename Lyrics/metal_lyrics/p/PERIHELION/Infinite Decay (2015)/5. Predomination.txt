Staring through this window I can only dream
The sad excuses holding me back
Drenched in sweat I can no longer see what this life means
Fluid motions, toxic rain

A million voices echo
A million screams are ignored
Break through the looking glass
Gripping the present and forgetting the past

Deteriorating in this depressing shell of a man,
Sinking in the ground we are finally alive
My mind is free
I know what I have become
The desolate misunderstood being

A million voices echo
A million screams are ignored
Break through the looking glass
Gripping the present and forgetting the past

Traveling alone
This world
Wonât understand
What it means
To be free
Open your eyes
See what you are meant to see

The light is waiting to be found
True purpose resonates within your soul
Embrace yourself you are meant for so much more
Drifting through time and space
The answers we seek only lie within ourselves
Will you choose to seek the truth?
Hidden in this dying world
Misunderstood being

I will let the rivers take me until I drown
Sinking in the ground
We are finally alive
My mind is free
I know what I have become
The desolate misunderstood being

A million voices echo
A million screams are ignored
Break through the looking glass
Gripping the present and forgetting the past
