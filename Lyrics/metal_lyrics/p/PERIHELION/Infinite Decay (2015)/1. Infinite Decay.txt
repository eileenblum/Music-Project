You crave control, you kill for greed.
Lining your pockets with the power you seek.
The world is fucking dying.
We have been bowing our heads for far too long
Worshiping the wealthy, there is no need for money.
They never wanted us to be free.

They just want your fucking mind [2x]

Buried deeper and deeper among the corpses of the lives that they have destroyed.
How far do you have to look to see that something is fucking wrong?!
If there was a god he would look at us and regret that he even made us.
So keep praying and see if you get an answer
Nothing is finite
Nothing lasts forever.
The power you crave
Will destroy our world
Decay [2x]
Fearful and on the verge of chaos
We are nothing but a means to an end.
Gasping for breath in this nonexistence
Vomiting your putrid holy water back into rivers
Where is your god now
I am the abomination you fear
I created no salvation.
