Sacrilegious burden upon my soul
Spilling blood of innocence I'm out of control
Demonic curse takes its toll
Darkness and death haunt my soul

Shape shifting demon a curse he cant control
Killing all his loved ones death haunts his soul
Trapped in darkness hidden from light
Creature of death haunts the night

A man bitten by a wolf and lives
Will possess power that consumes him from within
The beast he holds inside will never leave
The power he possesses will make humanity bleed

CURSED- To be lonely to fear the moon at night
CURSED- Is this changeling a creature of night
CURSED- Is this beast who will not be free
CURSED- To live life killing all you see
