Unsure of feelings as they enter into your mind
Mixing up reality with the dreams that you find

Left alone day by day
Slipping down further away
Hoping that you'll find
Release from this complex mind

Trapped in your own mind left there for all of time wait and see
You are condemned to a life of solitude within your own mind

Digging in deeper
To a curse you can not escape
Hoping that you'll find
Release from this complex mind

Left alone
Trapped inside
Damned a slave
Never to return again
Helpless soul
Craving death
Wanting peace
And no one seems to give a shit

Wishing to be set free from all this misery before its time
Your body will crumble in left with an empty shell for centuries

Digging in deeper
To a curse you can not escape
Hoping that you'll find
Release from this complex mind
