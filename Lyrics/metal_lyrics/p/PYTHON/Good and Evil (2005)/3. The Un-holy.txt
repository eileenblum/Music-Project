You try to find the answers inside your head
Visions come in the night and rape you in your bed
Hiding from your biggest fear your bodies good as dead
Cloaked in darkness black as night words are left unsaid

Rising tall
No one by my side
I stand alone
Until I die

Must accept
My destiny
To use the power
That lies in me

No one sees them come
Hiding from the light
Demons of the night
Seek out human life
Searching for the chosen one
Must obtain all his strength
The underworld wants to control
All the angel's strength

Running from demons hiding like a fool
You have the power to sentence them to their doom
No one can save you you must save your self
Giving into darkness and the evil of hell
