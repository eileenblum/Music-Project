Hells fire
Breeds desire
All is lost
Life's the cost
Now you'll see
Fate is hell
Eternal pain
Can be felt

He rises from darkness with demons at side
The ruler of hate and the taker of pride
The battle for life will never end
Your Fear and your pride get mixed up again

Heaven fights
To save us all
The demons run
From its call
The darkness cant
Defeat Gods light
Heaven smothers
Satan's might
