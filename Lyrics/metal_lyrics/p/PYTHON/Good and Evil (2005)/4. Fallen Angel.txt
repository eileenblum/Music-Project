The past comes right back just to haunt your soul
Memories have come and taken there tole
All of the ones who have prayed for their lives
Soon will be taken and then victimized

THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE
THAT SPILLS FORTH FROM THE NIGHT
THE BODIES OF THE DEAD
ARE SINGING IN MY HEAD

The coming of demons can not be foretold
Satan is laughing as he takes control
No one is set free from his evil clutch
Even the angels cannot do much

I am the one who can not be controlled
The ruler of darkness I never grow old
I live for your fear, blood, and your hate
Don't try to hide death is your fate
