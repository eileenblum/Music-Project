Poor and lowly mortal man
Teacher of truth and Gods commands
He brought forth peace and showed the light
Betrayed for greed he gave his life

Sentenced to death we wont forget
As his heart slowed within his chest
Body, blood, bread and wine
Left to us for all of time

Saviour comes at last
Predicted from the past
Teaches what he can
Body bled for man

See my soul - that brightens up the night
All must know -why I sacrificed my life

Now the nails run deep
Through my flesh
My sacrifice
You will not forget
I gave my life for your sins
On the third day I rose again
