There are bodies strewn all over my bedroom floor,
I don't know how they got there but I'm sure,
it's the fuckers in their ships
Taunting everyone who walks by as they sail through my front door
Through my bedroom window, not a window at all
but a hole that peasant left with his cannonball
They look so pretty
Pretty weak to have let it go on this long
There are still bodies thrown on my bedroom floor,
I don't know how they got there but I have a plan now
So they say we aren't really here
so don't just try to punish us,
you are the one who has lost his mind
We didn't bring the bodies, we couldn't throw them on your floor
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor
You are the one who has lost his mind
They look so pretty
Pretty weak to have let it go on this long
