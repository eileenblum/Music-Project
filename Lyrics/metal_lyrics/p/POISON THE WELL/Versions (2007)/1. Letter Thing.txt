Dear sweetie
Here I come with another Hey what's happening
Listen to me
Listen to me
You tell me you doubt I'm ordinary
Give me sunshine, make me happy
Give me sunshine
I'm holding in my fingers
The last string I'll set you free
there will be no more questions of strength
I cut my throat playing Indian
Dear sweetie
Here I come with another Hey what's happening
Listen to me
Listen to me
You tell me you doubt I'm ordinary
Give me sunshine, make me happy
Give me sunshine
I'm holding in my fingers
The last string I'll set you free
there will be no more questions of strength
I'll cut my boy playing Indian
I was trying to get to you
Well now that's a friend
You say you feel affection
so come now and save us
Dear sweetie
Here I come with another Hey what's happening
Listen to me
Listen to me
You tell me you doubt I'm ordinary
Give me sunshine, make me happy
Give me sunshine
