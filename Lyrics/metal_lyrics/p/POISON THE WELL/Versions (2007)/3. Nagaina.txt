I have a big secret
out of a shroud prison
The big horrible mess
I'm covered with mud and bile
Inching towards the crowd
Arms outstretched
Releasing my confession
I am a snake
I let my children let my children go
to fend for themselves
De scale me leave me naked on the cutting board floor
I have a big secret
Out of a shroud prison
This big horrible mess
Hing to dry in motherland
Sun tinted humidity
Releasing my confession
I am a snake
I let my children let my children go
Our lives are swamps
We are the swamp
Can you take it
Can't you just get rid of it all
I am a snake
I let my children let them go
