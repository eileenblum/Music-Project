Please everyone get on the ground now
I know you're scared but I always have been
I need this to get away
To finally be free
Horns on your heads
I'm not of this world
But I'm trying to make the best of it
So you won't stare that way again
Even if it means
Blow you all away
Put it in the bag
Or you will all just walk
Right out of here looking just like me
Unpassable as normal in your streets
I'll wear your horns as trophies
So you won't stare that way again
So I
So fucking I
So I won't have to feel that way again
Even if it means
blow you all away
I want it now
Like a child who can't get what it wants
I want it now
