What if the best position to be in
was shoved in the smallest crack in the wall
where claustrophobia kicks in
you will no longer breath
I can hear oxygen sing
Is it wrong to use despair
For our own personal gain
To fuel the fires in the guts
So happiness wasn't for you
it didn't come with the blood
Keep the slavery of despair
Get where you need to go
What if the best position to be in
Was shoved in the smallest crack in a wall
Where claustrophobia kicks in
Use them to get where you need to go
Heard you say if there's a flame
You'll burn every tree that you see
even the one you carved the lame
And the females name into
keep the slavery of despair
Get where you need to go
Frown all you give
You give them the best
Crooked smile is all you give
You give them the best
