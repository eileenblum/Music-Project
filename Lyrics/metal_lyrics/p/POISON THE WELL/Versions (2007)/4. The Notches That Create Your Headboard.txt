So tell me again how it felt
to give yourself to the scum
in the beautiful machine
where we made love
green and brown influence
had a hold of you
was there pleasure in your mind
excitement of this getting out
makes you scream
why couldn't that be the day
you choked on it
no one around
to save you
no one to crush your stomach from behind
Was it everything
do you regret your night
I recall you saying you don't regret a thing
well go on your way thinking of no one else
but yourself
Maybe one of these nights
A confession semi will smash your tires
from behind
just don't ask questions
just fly around
with your head cut off
never regretting a ...
no one around
to save you
no one to crush your stomach from behind
no one around
no one to crush your stomach from behind
