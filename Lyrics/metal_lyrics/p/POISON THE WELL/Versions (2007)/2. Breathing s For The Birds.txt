I want to become what I must
So I can tunnel through the ocean waves to you
I'm on my way now to you
The same thought enters my mind as I'm engulfed in steam
How happy she will be to see her monster become human
And I'm on my way now
No matter the things I say
I've cared for you all my life
Where am I why am I sure to have never existed
Destroying the homes of creatures trying to hide below
i will bash the rocks till my hands shatter
Making a straight path to you
I'm on my way now
No matter the things I say
I've cared for you all my life
Where am I why am I sure to have never existed
You must remember that I always swept the pieces I left behind
I've cared for you all my life
No matter the things I say
