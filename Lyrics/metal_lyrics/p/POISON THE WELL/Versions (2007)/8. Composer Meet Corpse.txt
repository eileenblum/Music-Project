I want to live on fire
I'll burn my bridges
Smarter man would have said no
Other men would have learned now
You want my money?
It spends like shit
The thief steals from the young
The suit steals from us all
I'll burn my bridges
Smarter man would have said no
Other men would have learned now
You want my money?
It spends like shit
Smarter man would have said no
Other men would have learned now
You want my money?
It spends like shit
I've had to live on fire
You will live, live on fire
