I'm not just your friend
I'm your skin and bones
I think that I can tell when you're acting
Like nails on the edge of a cliff
Your tongue wraps around your life
I will tell you how it makes me feel
I was the queen of the grand ole opry
Now I'm going down in a wad of flame
I'm not just your friend
I'm your skin and bones
I think that I can tell when you're acting
It's not good enough
I just want to see where you'll fall
Like nails on the edge of a cliff
Your tongue wraps around your life
I will tell you how, tell you now
How it makes me feel
Why argue
Without blood
without help
You'll be like all of us
Used to think there was no
future left to talk about
Open up and let the
king of flailing tongues in
I'm not just your friend
I'm your skin and bones
I think that I can tell when you're acting
It's not good enough
I just want to see where you'll...
