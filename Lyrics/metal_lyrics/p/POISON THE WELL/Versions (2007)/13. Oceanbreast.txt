Coming back from the body of what
Carry with me my conquests
My conquest
Come without emotion on a lie of thread
Why do I even do this anymore
Untill he'll enjoy it, allow this
Untill he'll enjoy it, allow this

This world now has seen this
Wonder whether it's only me who sees it

Speaking liquid in it's all of the air
Engines don't fail me now you'll burn
Minutes in the sky

This world now has seen this
Wonder whether it's only me who sees it
Oh if everyone around here
Is all safe you scar the almond
This world now has seen this

Give me deathbed, give me water and bliss
Always inside these tears
Away from grotesque orchards
I want to be inside with them
I want to be inside with them
