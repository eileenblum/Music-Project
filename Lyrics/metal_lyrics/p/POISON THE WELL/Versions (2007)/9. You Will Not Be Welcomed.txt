With your hand in mine the others tell me they need you,
To keep the rest at bay yelling sadness disagreement,
Pulling you into me, into body, the others will think ill of me.

You are sustenance
But my companion
So I want alone
Companion doesn't make good conversation

Giving you up I drown in eye water
as you are taken away,
hiding the fact that I'm breaking apart inside

You are sustenance
But my companion
So I want alone
Companion doesn't make good conversation

Sitting at the social event
I devour more of you
because I know that's what you'd want
Your head on a plate, eyes cold in sleep
You taste like dreams

You are sustenance
But my companion
So I want alone
Companion doesn't make good conversation
