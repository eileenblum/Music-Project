I've left my mark, I've made my statement.
I won't go unnoticed past this day.
My personal ideals a building block for this world.
Never again will I sit in silence.
As many sit by and watch our world pass by.
I refuse to take my seat, I refuse to die in silence.
So many die in silence, their voices go unheard.
They sit unnoticed, they stand alone.
Their voices dictate the way your life is lived.
Too afraid to speak, too scared to oppose
The fear inside you breeds your silence.
So now you live the life or another.
