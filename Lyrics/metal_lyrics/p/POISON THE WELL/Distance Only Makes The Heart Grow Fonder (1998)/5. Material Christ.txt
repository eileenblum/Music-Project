Your so-called meager life is plagued with riches
And born by the strong beliefs of your many victims
The task that they've entrusted within your powers
And yet they remain unchanged
Your god is non-existent

You speak of your god
Does he condemn your life?
You're nothing but a hypocrite
Actions speak over words

The many sins you've lived
The many lies you've told
You're defaming existence
Hidden by a power tie

Where's your god?
Who do you answer to
How do you live with yourself

Where's your conscience
Where's your conscience
Do you think this is just

Such an excess of assets
While they hope to eat
And your golden spoon
Is their hand to mouth

After your final days
Where will you go?
Your sins direct you, not your words

Your god is nothing
Your god is non-existent
Your god is nothing
Your god is non-existent

He's nothing
Nothing

Your god is nothing
Your god is nothing
Your god is nothing
Your god is nothing
Your god is nothing

Your god is nothing
