[Kurtz]

I've seen the horrors... horrors that you've seen.
But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have
a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but
you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for
words.. to describe.. what is necessary... to those
who do not know what horror means. Horror. Horror has
a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror
and moral terror are your friends. If they are not..
then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly
enemies.
