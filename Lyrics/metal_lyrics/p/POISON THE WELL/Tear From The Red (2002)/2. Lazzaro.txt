you say I need you
but how about the DEMONS in my head
I'm sure you don't miss them
cup my ears over and over when you speak
and I can't believe that you are here
I hate your eyes
it's been nice without you
and every word you say affecting me
keep your hands and your knees
because you'll need them later
you always smell the same
everything smells of you
I hate your eyes
you always smell the same
everything smells of you
you wanted it all
but now you can't see
what you adored in me
kill me again and again
so I can relive every moment with you
