You never understand
when you always act the same
oh beautiful your lips taste of red
copper always excited me
I need to hear your laugh when I'm dying on the other line
you perform better when I'm not near you
and it cracks the world spins away
I'm flying again
I can't believe that this is over again
pieces will carry away pieces of you in me
