With everything I've dragged in
venomous beings and all
It's nice to think that everything falls into place
but it doesn't
so guilty
so weak
so lost without you
now I know so guilty
so weak
stop calling me
please keep calling me
open your mouth to see if it's the truth
turn around so you can't see me say I miss you
stop calling
keep calling
stop calling me
