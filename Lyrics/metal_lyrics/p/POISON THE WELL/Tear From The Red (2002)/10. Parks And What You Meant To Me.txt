Wrap around
the white pavement feels so inviting
so lie back and gain bruises with me
it's been a long time since I've seen you from above
Youâre still beautiful
leave here we'll start something new in our embrace
with that crash your parts into mine
Intoxicate me with your many voices
And I'll never leave you and I'll never leave here

Iâll never leave you

Intoxicate me with all your voices
And crash your parts into mine
So lost inside of you âtil now I think we waited too long

So lost inside of you âtil now I think we waited too long
lock your doors and close your shades
I'll never find

Leave here we'll start something new in our embrace
