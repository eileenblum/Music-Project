Open everything around
how I want to say kiss me
you don't want to ruin anything
daring and beautiful stones
AIM at me
you never AIM at me
cursed with never being seen in your dreams
I'll walk around dead to you
I'll lie around dead to me
I feel soon
you'll wake with imaginary dreams
and wanting to hold this memory
always wondering who's coming to save
who's saving me
cursed with never being seen in your dreams
I'll walk around dead to you
I'll lie around dead to me
open everything around so all can see
how fast you waved good-bye
