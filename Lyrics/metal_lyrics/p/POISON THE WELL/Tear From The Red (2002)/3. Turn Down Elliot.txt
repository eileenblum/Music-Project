With every part of mine
fall away with every bit of you
I miss me
give me some place to find
I'll meet cold everyday
think of all I need you around
but for now anyways
hands held tight around me leave me
hands held tight around me
with every part of mine
fall away with every bit of you
I miss me
give me some place to find
I'll meet cold everyday
think of all I need you around
but for now anyway
hands held tight around me leave me
hands held tight around
I'll hang neck tight from anything for you
skies most wanted good-byes
you missed my face again
