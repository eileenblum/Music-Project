Living with a lack of light.
Things slip.
Things I know very much to be real.
In here I feel at rest.
The inside of my eyelids tell me so.
They are movie screens.

I find comfort in that I've been told I can't remain here.
To stay here would be a dream, but that's not what I want to be remembered as.
Someone who fell in.

We look for the best route.
The shortest most accurate.
I tend to enjoy the long ones.

I find comfort in that I've been told not to remain here.
I shouldn't stay.
It's not what mother wants for her cub.

I like it here.
Where I am I can make up anything.

I'm done with these movie screens in my head.
They've preoccupied me for long enough.

Come now stupid man you've been down there long enough.
Let's go do something with the day, you have hours and hours till night comes.

Nothing can hurt you in broad daylight.
In here I can feel at rest.
The inside of my eyelids tell me so.
They are movie screens.

I find comfort in that I've been told I can't remain here.
To stay here would be a dream.
But that's not what I want to be remembered as.
Someone who fell in.

I'm done with these movie screens in my head.
They've preoccupied me long enough.
Come now stupid man you've been down there long enough.
Let's go do something with the day.
