I sometimes wonder about myself.
Couldn't I just be making this all up as I go along?
Though I feel alone at times, shouldn't I feel like I belong?
I imagine myself to be who I want to be.
Though I feel along at time shouldn't I feel like I belong?
I can hear those trumpets they are playing for me and only me.
They are there to remind me I'm alive.

I sometimes wonder about myself.
Couldn't I just be making this all up as I go along?
I was born out of nowhere.
As if I had been dropped from the sky.
My mother the clouds that cushioned me.
My sister the flowers I saw on my way down.
My brothers cradled me as I laid there alone.
