Like the firm decision to bring forth axe to head.
I want this winged metal to go down.
Unfortunately for the ones I'm with I won't stop wishing, hoping, believing that eventually its weight will bring it down.

A small hint of me wants to save the young on board but I know what will happen.
The jaded will come tease them with years of no worries only to break it at the neck without warning.

Like the firm decision to bring forth axe to head.
I want this winged metal to go down.
Unfortunately for the ones I'm with I won't stop wishing, hoping, believing that eventually its weight will bring it down.

Butterflies nest in my body.
As I wait for it to happen I know how my story will end.
I've just never had the ground rush at me that fast.
I may regret my decision.

I've had the same dream over and over.
To be forever immortalized body and facial.
Like those who lived in Pompeii.

Like the firm decision to bring forth axe to head.
I want this winged metal to go down.
Unfortunately for the ones I'm with I won't stop wishing, hoping, believing that eventually its weight will bring it down.
