I've lived my life without direction.
Holding on to a gift given long ago.
Because of this I'll pay for my mistakes the rest of my life.

Dragging my body along the black expanse.
I can smell the burning trail left behind.

I'm not a failure.
I'm not alone.
As this comes to a close I look back.
Hoping to see myself.
And it's not because of the blaze I've left.
It's possible I've burned everything in my path.
I turn back and say because of how you have lived your life you will not find your way again.
I look back.
Because of how you have lived your life, you will not find your way again.

Because of this I'll pay for my mistakes the rest of my life.
I'm not a failure.
I'm not alone.
I've lived my life without direction holding on to a gift given long ago.

Dragging my body along the black expanse.
I can smell the burning trail I have left behind.
I'm not a failure.
I'm not alone.
