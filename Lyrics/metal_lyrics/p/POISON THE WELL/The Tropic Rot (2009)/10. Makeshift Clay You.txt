Your last breath escaped while I held you in my arms.
Drops fall in the water.
Drop as you have from my days.
You promised you'd meet me.
In the sky when the time was right as a ghost you'll stay at my side.

Not able to take my life for fear of rejection into the light.
So young am I.

Knowing I'll walk till the wrinkles come.
Days don't go by where I don't spit wounded letters at time for taking its time.

Not able to take my life for fear of rejection into the light.
So young am I.

Your last breath escaped while I held you in my arms.
Counting and counting till our reunion.
Still you can't place your hands on my face.
Alone alone with spirits and time that takes its time.

Not able to take my life for fear of rejection into the light.
So young am I.
