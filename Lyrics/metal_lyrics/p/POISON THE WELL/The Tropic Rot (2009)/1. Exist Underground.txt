So now you're gonna change everything?
How expected and unoriginal of you.
Now that everything is crumbling and not falling for your words you found the glue asked for not long ago.

You're scared.
Your existence no longer means what you thought it did.
Your body doesn't even accept what comes between your teeth as truth.
So hurry up now boy.
Start sweeping and gluing.
Get to work.

Nothing makes those around happier than to see that rabid mask melting onto your face.
This isn't a party, this isn't a holiday.
Your costume will not come off.
I know I can help you.
I'm inside you I am you.
I laugh as your idiotic mind wanders.
And it wanders.

You're scared.
Your existence no longer means what you thought it did.
Your body doesn't even accept what comes out between your teeth as truth.
So hurry up now boy.
Start sweeping and gluing.
Get to work.

You're scared well sniff the glue you fuck.
You're too late.
Nothing will change.
This will be a bad dream come true.
