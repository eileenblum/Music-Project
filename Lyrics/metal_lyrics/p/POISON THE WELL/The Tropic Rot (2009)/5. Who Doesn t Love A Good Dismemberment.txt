At one time when the days were nectar sweet I was a lovely boy.
I brought smiles in my bag to pass around to all the unpleasant I passed.
As life walked by.
I noticed it look at me and not once did it stop its horrible stare.
I made that my occupation, self proclaimed devourer of problems.

It must be a long project to finally bring someone to their knees.
It didn't like me fucking up the balance.
I'm undoing life's work.

Since I never once saw that gaze fade.
My bag became smaller, the unpleasant wouldn't accept my smiles as easily as before.
I think I'm losing my friends.

I noticed it look at me and not once did it stop its horrible stare.
I made that my occupation, self proclaimed devourer of problems.

I think I was a lovely boy.
It feels like a million years since I was him.
I noticed it look at me and not once did it stop its horrible stare.
I made that my occupation, self proclaimed devourer of problems.

To think those stories were a lie and all he had to do was fix a gaze on me.
To turn it all around.
I think I was a lovely boy.
Let's see if we cant make a lovely lovely man.
