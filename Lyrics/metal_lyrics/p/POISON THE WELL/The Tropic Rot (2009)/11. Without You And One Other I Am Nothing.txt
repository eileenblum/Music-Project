Swallow these pearls.
They surround the lives of the walking.
As they burst in your mouth.
Remember to breathe!
They surround the lives of the walking.
The ocean drowns the infant inside.

If you don't want to see the horses maimed by the waves, lift your arms signal the rocks.
Keep your arms up.
The vultures will soon be here to carry us home.
Yesterday is today.
Tomorrow will be our last.
What's left.

Swallow these pearls.
They surround the lives of the walking.
As they burst in your mouth.
Devoured by beak and wing.
We agreed we were not afraid to pass on.
Remember to breath!

Bubbles of voice whisper they whisper.
I'll be proud of you no matter what.
Damaging ears like fireworks.
Remember to hold your breath.
Lack of oxygen invites colors.
I'll be proud of you no matter what.

What's left?
Blue giant throats that cry your name till they are considered soul.
