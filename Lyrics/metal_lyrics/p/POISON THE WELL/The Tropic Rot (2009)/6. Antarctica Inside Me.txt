She's a ballerina.
She dances circles around me.
She tells me what I want to hear.
But I'm just never satisfied.
I live with a ballerina.
I live with a ballerina.

Those constant moves.
She never stops, she never stops.
It's making me nervous.
Taunting me on tippy toes.
When will my transformation come?
Those constant moves.
She never stops.

I sit under rain gathering the courage to do what my mind tells me?
But I'll just lay around.
I've become a joke, a disrespectful being that's been handed all he's ever wanted.
But can't find satisfaction.
What more could anyone ask for but a smiling blur, a perfect human being.
Those constant moves.
She never stops she never.

I sit under rain gathering the courage to do what my mind tells me?
But I'll just lay around.
I've become a joke, a disrespectful being.

She's a ballerina.
She dances circles around me.
She tells me what I want to hear.
But I'm just never satisfied.

Making her way through my body.
She's a ballerina.
Dancing around my head.
She tells me what I want to hear.
But nothing ever satisfies.
Making her way through my body making every organ touched more beautiful than the last.
