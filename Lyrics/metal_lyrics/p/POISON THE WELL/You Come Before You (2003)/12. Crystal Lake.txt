Overheard your conversation.
Tonight I'm not satisfied.
Sitting here I realize that I always think I'm right.
So it's over for all of you.
My scenery is lakes and trees
I just can't keep all concrete.
I've fallen for this metal and I love this handle
So it's over for all of you
Two round holes cut into this fabric.
And I will slide it over my head.
I'll chase you for all hours.
I never see you make the effort to chase me.
Now your final place is this lake.
Stare at me now on your way down.
