This morning when I awoke from the cushioned coils,
eyes pouring their little hearts. It didn't feel normal waking here
religiously,
thinking the same black thoughts.
As always you weren't lying next to me,
with that smirk on your face right then.
Were you giving me the images constantly flickering.
I'll take the advice passed down.
I see you on your side, bad luck.
Starlit nights when I awoke from the cushioned coils,
eyes pouring their little hearts. It didn't feel normal.
Nightmares stop reality, thinking the same black thoughts.
And this is the last time I'll be confused or compromise my emotions.
