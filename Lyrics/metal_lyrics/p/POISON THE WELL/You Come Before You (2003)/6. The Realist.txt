Please just this once, do this for me.
I've seen you in clouded visions saying goodbye.
I remember when we were gonna sit each other down and explain ourselves.
Always busy blame myself.
Your color was blue myself is making me feel that way.
I apologize apologize you're old enough to take care of...
If we can't speak go back to your bed so you'll be here when I wake up.
And I'm worried with no reason why.
Harm is an acquaintance and says it's not very fond of you.
Just this once "stay" I say. "I'll see you soon" he says.
Until you come back I will stay awake.
Your color was blue myself is making me feel that way.
I apologize apologize, you're old enough to take care of...
