I've woken up everyday with my eyebrows pointing at my mouth.
Making all who care for me go through all my worst times with me.
And I give them no choice...all my worst times with me.
I need to be unhappy to smile, but I haven't quite got the hang of it yet.
I need to figure out why this room has blinds that never open.
It's so hard to be these days.
I wasted all my time trying to remember
the word content was.
There isn't much to open eyes for.
I want to be excited just haven't been educated yet.
Wonder how long it will take before they leave me behind.
Questions in and questions out, they always ask me.
It's so hard to be these days.
I wasted all my time trying to remember
the word content was.
I just want to be happy.
