Could I end my life with a knife shaped of problems
sweet satisfaction of a night sky with horns
a papercut bleeds like a cut vein
could this sky open up and accept this tortured soul
but my wings have yet to work
but my wings have yet to work
change means nothing
when nothing wants to change
save your strength for the first disappointment
change means nothing
when nothing wants to change
save your strength for the first, for the first
forever is such an unpleasant word
it begins to eat you / from the inside out / beg for sleep
as this noose is tied around around your neck
a papercut bleeds like a cut vein
could this sky open up and accept this tortured soul
but my wings have yet to work
but my wings have yet to work
forever is such an unpleasant word
it begins to eat you / from the inside out / beg for sleep
as this noose is tied around your neck
as its tied around your neck
Could I end my life with a knife shaped of problems
shaped of problems
