I know very well the rain falls in drops [x2]
Winds call me
As rain falls in drops I drop my head
I'm ashamed and tempted to say
My heart has caught up to me
but still these words hold my hand
Please stay a while longer
I don't want to be alone
To see in your eyes is to stare in clear skies.
Clouds don't trail me anymore
