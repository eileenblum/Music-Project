Gouge out my eyes / pestilence
lack of love binds / propagate / the strife you desire
keep me from forced self depiction / abhorate
self assured I am no more / take this away from me once more /
thirsted for something that never existed /
Complacent / I am abomination / I replace
absence of malice / sew my mouth shut
the silent sound of the end / I drown in tears
Sinking in dreams / Of what I once owned
I avoid the setting of the sun [x2]
Memories fade as you did once before
Stole hope from right under my eyes
Accomplice of my death
