Why do your eyes paralyze me
What makes me feel this way
Carry me away with silence and heartbeats
As rapid thinking about your embrace
and how it makes me feel
I just want to feel this way forever
Sleep on portraits painted as perfect as you
Why have I been given the chance to fly away
When I'm not with you I feel so alone
Why have I been given the chance to fly away
I remember your face imprinted on angels
Your voice as beautiful as the sounds of waves
crashing against my heart
Time slows down when, you look at me
I'm infatuated with this, infatuated with you
I remember your face imprinted on angels
It's so hard for me to understand why
I hadn't found you before
hold my hand
