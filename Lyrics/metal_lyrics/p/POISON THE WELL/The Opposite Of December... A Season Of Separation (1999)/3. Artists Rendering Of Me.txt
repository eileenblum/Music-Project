With all my said unsaids / Never swallow
The idea of a happy ending
Another days memory dies
As I'm made to smile / these lifeless days
have left me with an empty heart
another wounded memory dies
I could / never / swallow your false ideals
of a lifeless / happy ending
how could words slit wrists and doors close
present day heart felt moments / killed by a slap
to the hand / another wounded memory dries
poisonous screams with messages
not thought of when released
another day here / another memory dies
