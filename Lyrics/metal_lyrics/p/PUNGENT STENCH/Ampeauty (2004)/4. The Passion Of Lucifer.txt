Hate me, slate me
Despise and berate me
All your prayers
Will not keep me away

Gore me, floor me
Insult and abhor me
It won't hurt me
Because I'm here to stay

Call me Satan
Name me Lucifer
Mark me Devil
I have many a name

Same old story
A memento mori
Someone to bear the blame

Seeking for salvation
Religion is your excuse
To justify discrimination
Oppression, and abuse
Your self-righteous behavior
Has caused so much harm and bale
No one will come and save you
That's just a fairy tale

Preaching love and forgiveness
Practicing war and pain
Millions have been slaughtered
And millions more will be slain
You won't take on responsibility
So you cower or you flee
That's why you created God
That's why you created me

Stake me, break me
You cannot forsake me
I'll be with you
And never let you down

Deny, defy
I am always near by
God has perished
I'll succeed to the crown
