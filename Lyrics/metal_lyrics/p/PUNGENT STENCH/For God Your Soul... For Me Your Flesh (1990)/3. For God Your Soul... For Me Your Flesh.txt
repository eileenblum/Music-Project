[by Schirenc]

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
What a big wast for a body like your's
The absurdity of burials rack my brain
All those valuable corpses why should they stay unused
For God your soul... for me your flesh
Your mortal remains are too good for hungry maggots
That's why I dig you outfrom your last resting place
I hope it's not to lame cause it would be a pity
If the decomposition already has advanced
For God your soul...
For God your soul, for me your flesh
I thik that's a fair bargain
For me your flesh, for me your bones
For me your brain and your entrails
I'll prepare you you got my word of honor
You will look nearly alive
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Don't be afraid I'll prevent it
