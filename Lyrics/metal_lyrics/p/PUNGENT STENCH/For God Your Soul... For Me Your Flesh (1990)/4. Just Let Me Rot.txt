The nightmare started just some weeks ago
Now I'm almost dead and nearly decomposed
First there was only this itching under my skin
Suddenly the vesicular eruption appeared
Nodular exrescences spread over my face
Countless harden bloodclots plug the veins
Unstoppable the death tissue proceed
No medicine can away my pain, death is what I need
Glandular abscesses inside of me
Let the digestive system refuse to work
My body performs wild contortions
Because the pain increases every hour
The gastric mucous membrane is even destroyed
And it's acid corrodes me inside
My fingers claw into my putrescent flesh
And leave me behind suppurated sores
Just let me rot
If only I could I'd make my sorrow and end
But I am already too weak to move
So I'm just lying in my own secretions
And wait till my body has liquyfied
I'm not able to stand up and get me some food
Therefor I have to eat my defecation
Hopefully I will be delivered soon
I don't want compassion just let me rot
