[by Wank]

I should be more than dead in my new bed
But something happened with me, I'm not dead I want be free
Come on let me out I start to scream and shout
But only the worms can hear my painful dying fear
I'm so alone in my new home
It's dark and gloomy but not very roomy
I don't feel good like I could
Suspended animation a bad situation
Let me out
Some friends here I got wait until I rot
They laugh 'cause I must be a fine repast
I'm not so dead like my doctor said
So let me out before I stop to shout
