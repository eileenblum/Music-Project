I sit at home and watch TV
Tits and games are boring me
The only show I like to see
True life - Reality
Rear-end collision in the highway fog
This news sounds good to me
Blood and guts and women with a shock
I zip away
A boy out the window of a burning house
He is very brave and jumps
A lovely sound and the brain slashes around
I turn it off
I sit at home and watch TV
Reality shows are boring me
The only thrill I like to see
Real life - Reality
I spill the oil in my favourite  turn
And watch the speedsters crash
I hear them scream and watch them  burn
No zip away
Wood and carpets burst in flames
I used the gasoline
The office-employees in the 22nd floor
Screams
I call the private television network
Front row for the cameramen
I prefer to watch true reality at home
True life - Reality
Real life - Reality
True life
