Uno, dos
Uno, dos, tres
Klyster boogie
Klyster boogie
I am addicted to my severe rubber-queen
She's my nurse if you know what I mean
You would never believe what she really, really means to me
Her climax-clinic is just where I wanna be
Yeah, a klyster with champ agne
Yeah, that's my favourite game
Yeah, caviar-dinner is it's name
Yeah, her stool is what I claim
Klyster boogie
Klyster boogie
Anal-flavour is my therapy
The sound of her farts is like sweet melody
Waiting for her faecal matter
Warm and fresh it tastes much better
Yeah, my tongue-penetration
Yeah, heals every constipation
Yeah, that's just my cup of tea
Yeah, Her faeces cover me
Klyster boogie
Ohooh
Klyster boogie
Some might say I'm perverted, mean and sick
But I don't care - Fuck you all and suck my dick
Never would tell you what you are allowed to do
So respect me like I'm respecting you
Yeah, a klyster with champagne
Yeah, that's my favourite game
Yeah, caviar-dinner is it's name
Yeah, her stool is what I claim
Yeah, my tongue-penetration
Yeah, heals every constipation
Yeah, that's just my cup of tea
Yeah, Her faeces cover me
