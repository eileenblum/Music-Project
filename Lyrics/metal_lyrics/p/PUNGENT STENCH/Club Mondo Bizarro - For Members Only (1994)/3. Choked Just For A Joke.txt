He was known as a choker
Strangled people wouldn't say a joker
He choked them with a necktie
Eyes popping out - No air - Die!
Choked just for a joke
Males with a rope
Females got a tie
Die!
With his murderings he earned glory
To his victims he never said sorry
Put the string around your head
Laughed and screamed -  You  were  dead
Choked just for a joke
Males with a rope
Females got a tie
Die!
Choked just for a joke
Males with a rope
Females got a tie

Die!
