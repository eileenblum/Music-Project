So what do you think now stupid little smack
Thought you could play the tough guy or what
You won't leave this cell until your brain's doing well
And if you don't obey I'll teach you...
Shut up - I'll fucking get youI'll smash all of you
Got nothing to regret
And I will not forget
My aim - Punishment - Pain
My will  - Torture - Kill
My injunction is to change your confused mind
And believe me, we will do our best
Brain-washing, injections, shock therapy and special treatments
You deserve to suffer and...
Fuck you - You can't bring me down
Where's a will there's a way
No walls will held me in
My revenge will double my sins
You fucking freak shouldn't live on this earth
You're a waste of life and worth being killed
Death sentence actually is still not enough for you
But your wishes for us will come true for you
No way I'll change my mind
Hatred burns too deep inside
Try to kill me but beware
You'll be dead before I bleed red
My force - Hatred - Sin
My end - Sorrow - Grief
My aim - Punishment - Pain
My will - Torture - Kill
