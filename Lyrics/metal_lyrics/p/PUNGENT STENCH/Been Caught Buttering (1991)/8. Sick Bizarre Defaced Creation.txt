[by Wank]

Crippled - You were born as a premature birth
Defaced - Miscarriage would be a better word
You've got two hands but only one mouth
Your eyes can't see and your nose is your tongue
Sick
Bizarre
Defaced
Creation
Deformed - Not worth living but alive with pain
Bizarre - Your appearance people laugh and squeal
Your arms are too short three fingers aren't a hand
Your chest is one breast, your belly just fat
Sick
Bizarre
Defaced
Creation
Sick - But not sick enough to die and leave
Misshapen - Got no help feel sorrow and grief
You got a big cock but a pussy too
Not man, not woman, they say hermaphrodite to you
Sick
Bizarre
Defaced
Creation
Degenerated - Not able to walk and run
Repugnance - Society feels no compassion for you
Your legs are dead and crippled too
"So where's the point to keep me alive!?"
Sick
Bizarre
Defaced
Creation
