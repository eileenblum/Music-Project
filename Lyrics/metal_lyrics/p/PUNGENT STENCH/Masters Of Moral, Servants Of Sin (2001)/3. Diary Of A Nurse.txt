Daddy's gone
left his spawn
he won't return before dawn
she's the nurse
she's perverse
by the end of night you'll need a hearse

trapped with this furious hag
the children start to cry
no rescue anywhere
they know they have to die

as she scents
excrements
she smears the shit with her hands
in their eyes
on their thighs
sharing that feast with the flies

their screams increase her lust
excite her hideous greed
the aspect of disgust
the pleasure to stampede

this is how the story goes
in it's entire glory
she takes off all her clothes
first she spreads her flabby butt
and makes them lick her twat

When her juices start to flow
she's reaching for her bag
to get her whetted hoe
ruthless is the attack
as the nanny begins to hack

children's blood got spilled tonight
body parts adorn the room
what a vision of delight
with her long finger nails
she rips out their entrails

now that her work is done
there's no more screaming
she had a lot of fun
now comes the cleaning

she picks the children up
slowly and placid
dissolves their corpses in
sulfuric acid

the sun comes up and she has to scoot
before the cops embark the pursuit
inside her head the memories remain
of all these naughty kids she had slain
