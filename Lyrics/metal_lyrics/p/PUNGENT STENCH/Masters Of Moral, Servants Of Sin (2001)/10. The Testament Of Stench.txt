Beware of
false prophets
which come to you in
sheep's clothing
but inwardly
they're ravening wolves
Matthew said

I proclaim
Matthew's right
it's great to be a wolf
raging wolf
razorsharp teeth
rip &amp; shred the sheep
Amen Christ

now the works of the flesh are manifest
adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife,
seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
drunkenness, revellings, and such like:
of the which I tell you before,
as I have told you in time past,

that they which do
such things
shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.

Saint Paul the Apostle
wrote to the Galatians
and I'd say
he's almost right!

the works of the flesh are manifest
indeed our goal supreme
adultery is advisable
fornication a virtue
definite uncleanness and sexual lasciviousness
the most beautiful ever
Idolator is my vocation
witchcraft my natural gift

Hatred &amp; variance
my Christian Name
Emulation a foreign word
wrath &amp; strife my family name
sedition is my ambition
heresy for you and me
envy for every cent
drink &amp; gorge unlimited

Jesus answered them
verily verily
I say unto you
whosoever committeth
sin is the servant
of sin

aha, soso,
verily verily
you are a smack
I'm a sinner
a hellish sinner
real servant of sin
