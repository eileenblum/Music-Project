Baptized in excrements
I am the chosen one that brings salvation
The scourge of him who owns your souls
Defecating flame of god - chastisement

I bathe my leprous limbs in blood
read the prevision in my guts - world demise
Receive the holy communion
And share the corpse of Christ with me - taste his flesh

Fervent angel - I'm breathing fire
Acid is pouring through my veins
putrid bringer of retaliation
sanctify the human blain

pest control of our creator
I purge the bowels of the earth
strip the skin of every traitor
blood stained from vaginal birth

unsoundness
and outrage
has venomed
the shameless

the root of
all evil
no hope for
retrieval

killing spree - relentless gutting
visitation for your sins
The time has come to face your master
let the massacre begin

to pave my way with bones
to drink the unteachable's blood 
to gouge out the eyes of the blind
to bring credence mankind
painful deliverance
tonight everything ends
