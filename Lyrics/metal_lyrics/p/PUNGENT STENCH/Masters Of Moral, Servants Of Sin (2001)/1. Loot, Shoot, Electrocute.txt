charged for murder
first-degree
fingerprints agree
searched my home for evidence
cause for this offense

I am the scapegoat for authorities
a suspect without alibi
testimonies were utmost doubtful
still they sentenced me to death

execution
on the chair
I yield to despair
visitation
from a priest
ransom for the beast

washed my body
shaved my head
no more tears to shed
plugged the power
took my life
fried my ass at five
