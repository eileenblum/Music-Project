sometimes
I wake up in the middle of the
night
voices in my head trying to
ignite
the burning hate that's driving me
insane
grabs my mind and strikes my soul with
pain

covered in sweat
stomach upset
no more sleep
cum on the sheet
slimy excrete

sometimes
I just cut my skin to gain
relief
shed my blood to wash away the
grief
scribe inverted crosses on my
chest
then I purge my bowels and I get
dressed

start out to school
wrathful and cruel
no more grace
snatched up from
rotten.com

put on my trench coat and grab my father's gun
a sawed-off rifle is a guaranty for fun
a king-sized box of ammunition 'cause I'm smart
I won't run out of bullets when the party starts

class has begun as I am entering the room
before the teacher starts to bitch I perforate her womb
her torn up innards make a nasty smacking sound
as they spout around my face and hit the classroom's ground

the air is filled with smoke, dead bodies adorn the floor
horrified teenagers are pushing to the door
I pump a bullet into every single head
But I won't go to jail and kill myself instead
