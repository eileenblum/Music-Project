We are the force
of Christian believes
the ones who preach the mass

our celibacy 
a false pretence
we love to go through your ass

nuns get laid
but rather raped
we just force them without care

we like boys too
from tip to toe
but don't think that's a love affair

all together now
Viva il Vaticano!

Call us priests
or call us saints
leaders of catholic believes

We're God's arm
so listen to us
us - the faith thieves

Read the bible
believe in it
believe what the maker said

sin against God
or sin against us
you'll burn in hell and forever dead

Now all together
Viva il Vaticano!

extended godly arm
the boys from Vatican
their might is right
Catholic delight
as history shows
death to their foes
the holy crusade
in the name of the blade

rape, pillage &amp; burn
last exit - a funeral urn
Vatican's ambition
heathen submission
for every servant of sin
unbeliever, heretic &amp; libertine
they offer death &amp; damnation
or a underage defloration
