Rotting fetus in your womb 
Your own body is his tomb 
Mucous little brat 
Drowned in clothing blood 
Disgusting gastric juice 
Drops out of your mother's vagina 
Pungent stench of festered gore 
Your pussy is a vicous sore 
Worms in your entrails 
Prey upon the melted embryo 
Corroded brain and skin 
Your son died for your sin 
Too many drugs in pregnancy 
You killed your child but now it kills you 
Titanic waves of bestial stench 
Comes from your month it's the child's revenge 
Bursting boils nauseous flood 
Malformation and yellow blood 
Now you can dig in your baby's guts 
Tear the corpse out and look what you've done 
Don't repent this mistake, now you get your punishment 
The little brat will rip you till the end
