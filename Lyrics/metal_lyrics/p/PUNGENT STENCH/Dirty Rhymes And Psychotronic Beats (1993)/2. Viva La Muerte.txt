Que pasa Hombre, do you know what's up?
Don't fuck with me, baby, I'm gonna kick your butt
Your blood will flow when I start to cut
I'm a thriller, a chiller, a killer and though like Godzilla!
Man you gotta kiss me where the sun don't shine
I'm an assassin,
I kick your ass and I tear your spine.
Pretty soon your face will be my seat
But before you die you will dance this pungent beat
I think you don't know what I am
A homicidal lunatic
Despair of mankind
Human life ain't shit to me
And you will repent
That you came into my life, fuck your body up like a carcrash
Shoot you in your head, turn your face into a mash
I'm not afraid to die, because I am invincible
Viva la muerte, that's my goddamn principle
Yeah I like to kill at will
Against a guy like me exists no medicine or pill
Fucking bath my hand in human waste
Your twisting flesh is what I wanna taste
The disagreeable part is yet to come
I'm gonna get your bitch and fuck this piece of scum
And when you start to smell, after a while
She has to suck your dick, when I screw her in doggy-style
I jerk off in your face
And she licks it up
She swallows everything
Watching this stupid chick
Sucking a deadmans dick
Makes me really hot
Just like a rebel, I'm making trouble
Bitch, shut up otherwise you make it double
Don't offer resistance, because I am invincible
Viva la muerte, that's my motherfucking principle
