Atomism is a way in the crowded world today
Little dancing tender child
Why have all your dreams gone by

I took them in a tower where all the big black flowers died in a
Dreadful horror
When they heard the ghastly hour

Why can the bodies fly without a laugh (we killed it) I am lost in
Darkest woods
Without a moon (they killed it)

Starless night, deathful night ghosts are walking in the tropics like
The shadows making terror
On the morrow of the sun

I pushed them in a tomb where all the godly mob dried of insolently gush
Cause everybody was a lush [yes that's exactly how it reads]

Why can the bodies fly without a laugh (we killed it) I am lost in
Darkest woods
Without a moon (they killed it)

Black flowers thrown in my way of power
Crushing the diverted crowd

Insight look in an ol'
Fairy book teach you more of devil's brain
Catalistic thoughts in a poet's mind
Cull the flowers of my time

I took them in a tower where all the big black flowers died in a
Dreadful horror
When they heard the ghastly hour

Why can the bodies fly without a laugh (we killed it) I am lost in
Darkest woods
Without a moon (they killed it)

(we killed it they killed it)
