Domestic happiness is disturbed
The head of the family was going insane
Daddy's loading his gun
And sticks the barrel into the cunt of mom
The bullet's boreling through her womb, her body is worn out
The shredded ovaries are bursting through her belly

Daddy takes the kitchenknife and skins his twisting wife
Resolves her flesh to handy hunks and fee it to the dog

Subsequently daddy lifts the tyke over his head
Then he throws the dog into the waste-disposer

Entering the children's room
The dripping head of mom is swinging on his belt
The kids can't understand
Why the fuck their daddy's got a dagger in his hand

Ramming the blade in his daughter's neck
Breaking her bones with a loathsome crack
Gutting the girl with a smacking noise
He fills the empty body with her toys

His son is the last in line - only three years old
He tries to hide behind the wardrobe - unsuccessfully

He grasps the screaming bastard, dashes him to the ground
Then he nails the little boy to the wall

After the work is done daddy leaves the house
Purposefully he's walking to the neighbours family
