Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
First you, you gotta find her
If she?s an airhead you never mind her
You search throughout every club in the land
It?s better than using your hand
You find yourself a real dumb chick
Someone to get down on your dick
Then you know what you got to do
You take her home now for a screw
You got to
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Then you, you got to feel her
Then you, you start to peel her
You feel up her booty and you feel her tits
Make sure she hasn?t got no zits
Feel her body and you feel her ass
Make sure she?s got a lot of class
Then you know what got to do
You take her home now for a screw
You got to
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Then you, you got to fuck her
If she?s got big tits you suck her
Then you fuck her for a little while
Ram it on home now doggy style
Rubbin? and oozin? and maxin?
And squirtin? it right in her face
She?s the biggest slut in the place
Then you ball her with her legs in the air
Or on a bed or over a chair
You got to
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her...
There she is,
That big ugly airhead
She?s cuming back,
What do we do men?
We find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Then you, you got to forget her
Pretend you never met her
You point to the fucking door
And say get out of here,
You fuckin? whore
Pick up your bra and pick up your blouse
And get the hell out of my house
Pretend you never met her,
It?s time to regret her
You got to
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
There she is,
She comes back for more
What do we do men?
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
