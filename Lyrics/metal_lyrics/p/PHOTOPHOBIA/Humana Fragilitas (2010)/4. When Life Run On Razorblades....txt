Every night I try to disintoxicate myself
From this existence

Lacerating ...

It doesnât matter if internally
Or just my surface ...

I lacerate...

As everything becomes more pleasant
Little by little that the blood awakes my limbs
I understand my failure as a human being
Created for dying â¦ But not destined
To comprehend life

This melancholy that pervades my body
An arcane mortal call
In this perverse and cruel life

Lacerate..

My only way to feel myself alive â¦
Is to be dead
