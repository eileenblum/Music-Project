My veins dropping on this lightened path
When my sight praticing this dazzle 
The cruel image penetrating my yes

Feather dirty of blood
Dying angel â¦ blaming my choose with their inexpressive gazes

Isnât true that paradise is light?

I reach the witheness with suicide 
Tasting my blood o cherubins 
And feeling the taste of a mortal existenceâ¦
