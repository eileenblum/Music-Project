I burn myself into remorseâ¦
A life of false promises 
Life is positive?
That life gives to me?
Only suffering and delusions

Guilty is not of depression or of disease of life
But of the human kind
So ready to hurt , judge and kill

Now is too late to forgot
I will rotting myself in that putrid life
And when my end is nera â¦
I will make the best view. And whatching them
Dying one by one â¦
Your life ends â¦ with my hate
