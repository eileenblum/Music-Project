Walking on the damp soil  
Into the infinity of my thoughts  
Rain hides my sensations...  
And makes disappear my perception of time   
Crawling... seeking comfort between ethereal teardrops...  
I think about the past and it can't no longer be  

Glimmers of life with you...  
With your contact... with your wishes  
I could finally be a part of this weak race  
That loves, suffers and hopes  
Hopes in a world always pleased and joyful  
What a pathetic belief  
When all that I desired, believed and lived falls to pieces  
Where are you... when my world is coming to end?  

Only your voice  
Could save me from this voidâ¦  
'cause this will be my last cut..
