my spirit left from me to the stars

I desire to fly
in the nocturnal breeze
look at everything from above
and don't care at all:

Only breaking the chains of human monotony
i could judge without bein' judged
and finally i'll show myself like truly i am

I've always hesitate, feared...
now it's no more
pressure grows stronger
it's like runnin'towards an abyss knowin' you don't want to stop

I desire to fly
in the nocturnal breeze
look at everything from above
and don't care at all:

Like a poison that pierce the skin
my soul tries to free from this prison of flesh and blood

stars are aligned...the last chain is broken

my spirit left me reachin' the stars
