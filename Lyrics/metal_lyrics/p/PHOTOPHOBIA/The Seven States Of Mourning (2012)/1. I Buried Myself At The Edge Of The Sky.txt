I've been isolated like a contagious patient
by those who live never understandin' life
and dyin' without tryin'to know death...
like if it shouldn't touch'em

Only who knows suffering could rise
above the weak and the naive
so anyone that has known pain
will be like a cancerous cell...
always prepared to activate...

A human expect only to die
let the blade penetrates the flesh
let the blood warms the skin
while everything dissolve

times goes deadly
you grow up prematurely
life become a slow death
unnecessary ditress
only death could heal
i want to lose all my earthly marks
and disappear between the clouds
buried forever at the edge of the sky
