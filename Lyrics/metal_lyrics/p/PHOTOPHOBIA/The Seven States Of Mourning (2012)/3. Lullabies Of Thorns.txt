Gently i bleed
wrapped into thorns
which i've been always surrounded to
gently i agitate myself while they deeply penetrate
life is like a hand that lift you up
then let you fall down

since i took my very first cry
i knew i wasn't in the right place (to be)
i grew outwardly
but in my heart that primordial pain

now i close my eyes
and i sink myself between the coils of quiescence
like a baby
that in the cradle
cries..from suffering

look to my eyes that sleeps eternally
who hasn't consciousness now?
