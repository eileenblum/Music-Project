Life is a weapon
that inevitably strike us
i laugh planning the end...

who'll stand in defense of the hope?
when the abyss'll have swallowed all the light

who'll observe the decay
when the ruins of the world'll have hidden everything...

who could see the future
when all the children'll be blind...

man is the parasite
man is the cancer

creator and destroyer
flesh hungry
emotions greedy

until our weak envelope isn't saturated
and slowly devour us..
devour myself

voce narrante

another suicide
shakes the world
i'd never thought it could be so painful...

i read back that letters... at first meaningless
now i swear myself...

grey shadows drive my journey
and i become a shadow
rememberin' my last embrace
