Tonight a carnivore is out
Lust burning in his head
The need for flesh leads him
Right between your thights

Violent energy hammers
His body into yours, animalistic rituals
No love, just wantoness
No love, just wantoness

Lust, physical, liquids, blood

One big piece
Of meat they are
Slaves of sexuality
Careless sinners

Producing
A hunger for
Someone's most infected
And rotten parts

One constant
Rythm of work
For the bad machine
Extending your hole

Sucking out
The entire pride
Of the partner's meat
Crude penetration

It makes him roar
Body against body
Sweat, saliva, and sperm
And once again he scores...
