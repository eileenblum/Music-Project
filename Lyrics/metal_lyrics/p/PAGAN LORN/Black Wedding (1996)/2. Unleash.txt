Searching for the spotlight
To clear up your wickedness
You have waited so long
Penetrating yourself
Diving deeper to the forgotten parts
Swimming through the black water
Going deeper and deeper
To the place where your pearls lie

Delighted by success
You rise up to the sky
Now you are a believer
Greeting with your pearls
You go up to the sun
Like a newborn Phoenix
Nothing can stop you now
Grappling for the crown
Changing to become the light
Now you are a star
Shining bright in the night
Please, if you wait
I will be there!
