The most damaging of lies
Are ones you come to believe yourself
So hide behind your broken smiles
Try to conceal how hideous you really are
It's just a matter of time before the mask rots
And you're found out
Inside this soundproof box we've built for ourselves
You've traded a gift that few possess for a prison cell
Fading out into your thoughts has become your coffin
The only one giving up is yourself
I've never seen you so lost
Inside this soundproof box we've built for ourselves
The mouth falls open but the voice has been lost
We'd be better off jawless
You dare to face this on your own
Did you really think your fragile bones could carry this weight alone
Your arrogance will bury you
Inside this soundproof box we've built for ourselves
When will you wake up and see what you've become
Asleep inside a coffin
I've never seen you so lost
My eyes have seen too many miracles
To choose to become blind now
