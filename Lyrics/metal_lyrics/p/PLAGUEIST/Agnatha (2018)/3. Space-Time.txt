It lures you in with radiant flickers of light
Just to collapse on itself
And what awaits is only death and darkness
A pitch black nothing
That finds a way to rivet both of our eyes
While we decay from inside
I saw the end
I know the outcome
We've been misled
I know the outcome
There's nothing left out there except unmanned ghost ships
I saw the end
(This was all a pipe dream)
I know the outcome
(Lights and clockwork)
We've been misled
(Inside empty machines)
I know the outcome
And what awaits is only death and darkness
A pitch black nothing
I won't be around to watch
When your limbs decide to disjoint themselves
I've started digging graves
A place for memories and keepsakes
We can never become whole again
If we believe human life is nothing
More than aimless molecules
And as your skin begins to atomize
Don't say I never warned you
With one last thought before you close your eyes
What will your mind latch onto
Do you see?
There is no escape
