Sliding and spinning, relying on reflex
The flash of an instant removes all control
Explosions of memories start flooding the senses
Blurring the guardrail that beckons me home
A lifetime wrapped around fractions of seconds
Mistaking the hands on the wheel for my own
I feel the periphery closing
So this is it
This must be how it was written to end
To all my family and friends:
I will wait for you beyond the fence
I've always said that when I fall asleep in death
I would fear nothing
This feels no different
As calm acceptance welcomes fate
The foot becomes weighted
To greet an old friend
I hear the impact before it happens
And see the result, distorted and bent
But just as fast as it came
I am awakened
Blink a few times
Draw in a breath
Still traveling over the safest of pavement
This accident's always been all in my head
Now I'm left with nothing but daydreams
Of what might have been
Memorizing lines and shapes
That I can't seem to connect
I feel the periphery closing
So this is it
This must be how it was written to end
