Now our lives are lost
Lost in robotic monotony
Holding onto broken compasses
Turning nowhere
The gears are missing teeth
And you just keep pretending
Mindless and motion-sick is all we're meant to be
You'd rather disconnect than risk feeling something
The lies we tell ourselves to sleep at night
Open your eyes
We are the grain of sand that claims to know an ocean
And drowning in our own insignificance
Until we lift our heads to look fear in its face
There's no escape from all the nightmares that replay
In our waking minds constantly
That sinking feeling inside our guts (constantly)
Is our subconscious reminding us (constantly)
We're made of more than rust-worn mechanics
So we repeat the infinite orbit
Against our true wiring
Confined to the lines we've been given
Never asking ourselves
How much more have you and I to learn
