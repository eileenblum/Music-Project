So you have it all figured out
The nights you spent awake
Stacking stone on stone
Until your hands bled
That led you to this
Long-dead cinders bound by new cement

These four walls are now your home
Nothing out there can harm you again
But the monsters you tried to keep out
Were living (monsters) inside your head
Now you are forced to live with them

No hope, no hope of escape
No doors, no hope of escape
No windows, no hope of escape
No mirror, mirror to reflect what you became

You let the chance to face yourself
Pass you by like a rainstorm
Now you won't see the sun again (monsters)
Now you won't see the sun again (monsters)
Now you won't see the sun

Desolate and out of touch
Enclosed within this space

Fragments of who you used to be
Grow dimmer everyday, dimmer

Cold concrete, your voice starts to fade
Constricting, no hope of release
Hauntingly, the walls start to speak

For every brick that's peeled away
There are two more to take its place
For every brick that's peeled away
There are two more to take its place

(There's something cold in the sky)
