Everyday, I hate those fuckers who talkshit to me.

We will never fail,
'Cause fail is for the frail.
We just never drop our dream,
'Cause we fuck the dead.

I refuse to kill my own dreams,
And I refuse to die tonight.

If I can forget those words, I will be alive!
The Last Fallacy will be done.

Stop crying, plague is suffering myself.
