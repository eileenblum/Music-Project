Another day to absorb your words,
Another day to see my family's collapse on your feet.

Another day to absorb your words,
Another day to hope your fucking death.
Which is the price to pay?

Another day to hope your death.
Which is the price to pay?
For that, close yourself fucking mouth.

How long still do we've to cry,
To take you a sadder silence?

I already found the place of your dead,
No longer lacking anything, then just to dig.
Next drop: Bury you alive!
