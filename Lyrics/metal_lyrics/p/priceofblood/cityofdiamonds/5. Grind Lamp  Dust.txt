You never were alone,
How it was before your birth?
You just never existed.
The Death is the fuckin' same.

How, do you move alone?
This is our time to...Fuck!

It's not vengeance,
My pride, our sins, call us back.
Go, go, right, go!

You're not alone (anymore),
But I've been here far too long.

For those who know,
They're against our fucking will.

It's not vengance,
My pride, our sins, call us back.
You are no longer
My fucking pride.
