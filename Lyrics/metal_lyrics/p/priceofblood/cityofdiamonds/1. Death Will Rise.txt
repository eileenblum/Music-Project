I am amazing,
I've crushed every skyscraper
With my own blood.

I will be your fucking plague,
(The) epitah of your grave.

I hunted the sun with my shadow!

(Then the) Death will rise!

I want your face on the ground,
To be wise to destroy your dreams.

I am amazing,
I've crushed every skyscraper
With my own blood.

We're all there for the same reason,
To enjoy our musical passion.
Hey man please take care about it.
Bounce!

As strong as the weaker chain's link;
The lower common denominator.
Now I'm dreaming about something
That no one ever delighted before.
You paid your royalty, so I'm rising.

I don't care who you are,
Just gimme some respect if you wanna fuck,
Bring yo'ass on the dance floor and bounce.
A laser point on your forehead!
