(I'm) constantly challenging myself,
Detect and kill, just a day to the new dark,
And I'm so real, overside, I'll confront ever strike.

I'll confront ever strike.

Better I'm chocking you, lover.
Better I'm fucking you, lover.

Tuneful screaming, I've buried these lies.
Inside, violence fermentation; vengeance's mine.
Is it a world where shit equal talk?
Beneath yesterday, I'm seeking for tomorrow.

(I'm) constantly challenging myself,
Detect and kill, just a day to the new dark.

And I'm so real, overside, I'll confront ever strike.

This is the end motherfucker!

Fuck you who you are,
'Cause P-O-B is rockin' hard this dance floor.
Just stand up and never give up, this way is ours.

Progression.
