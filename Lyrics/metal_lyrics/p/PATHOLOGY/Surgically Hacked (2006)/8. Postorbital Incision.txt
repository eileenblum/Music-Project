Reach behind the eye
Remove the bleeding object
Sever nerves and vessels
Postorbital incision
Lacerate the membrane
Look into the open cavity
Locate the frontal lobe
Gouge it out carelessly
This is an imperfect example
Of a malpractice surgery
Since the victim was alive
This act is seen as torture
To some it gives pleasure
It may seem too horrible
So in disgust...
Ignore the pain
Accept the misery
Follow through
One should do
Ignite the remains
Excitement settles
Slit open ear to ear
