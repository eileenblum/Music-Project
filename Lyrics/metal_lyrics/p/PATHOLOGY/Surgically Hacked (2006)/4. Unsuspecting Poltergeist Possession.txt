Unsuspecting poltergeist possession
Awaiting the return into the body
Long lost soul, no where to be found
In a realm of confusion &amp; disorder
Looking for an answer to the questions
Of where it is this ghost had been
Finding nothing valuable, to existence
Where the minds &amp; body are this fiend seeks
An endless search to what what went wrong
The mark of death unable to be seen
Misery among there wretched beings
Lurking in the depths of time alone
No one to talk to, dakness to roam
Alignment of the stars will set them free
In search of purpose &amp; a destiny
Soon they hope the signs will lead them
Although for now nothing is a satisfaction
Only understanding more will come
No one leaves this prison of consciousness
Time they have so much &amp; something tell
If you ask these being what they want
There is no telling what will happen
Thay have forgotten what it is to be alive
Now they only understand how to survive
