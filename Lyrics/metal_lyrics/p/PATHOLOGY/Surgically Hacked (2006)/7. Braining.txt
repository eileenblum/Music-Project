Spinal cord snaps on impact
The lead pipe smashing thorugh
Initial impact, devastating blow
Bits of skull fall below
Let the braining begin
Smash in the skull
Brain matter filling the pavement
As the victim falls down
The body splashes in blood
All components of the head escape
The wound was fatal
No chance of survival
Chunks of bone hardly detectable
Thickness of the blood drains
Immediate convulsions are seen
By witnesses to this brutality
The sorrounding audience
Vomit at this sight
Cranial bashing has left
This victim lying in blood
From a mutilated beast
The killer begins his spree
