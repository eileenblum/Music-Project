Multiple organ failure
Your liver starts to rot
Muscle spasms will occur
As your body falls apart
It begins you understand
Foreign toxins under you skin
Tearing though living flesh
Septic shock
Totale infection
Inevitable death
Heart failure
Out of breath
Can you see...
Your life leaving...
Can it be...
No more breathing...
Capillaries bursting inside
Blood blots filling veins
Arteries explode and drain
Body soaked in putrid fluids
The doctors cut out the brain
