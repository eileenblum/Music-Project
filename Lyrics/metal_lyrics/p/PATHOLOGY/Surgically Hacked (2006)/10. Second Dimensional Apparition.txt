Total annihilation
Extermination of the feeble
Mutilate the mine of the weak
Desecrate the tomb of the buried
Obliterare those who confront
Brutalize everyone &amp; everything
Create a legion to dominate
One who will lacerate
Righteous warriors conjugate
Come together and kill
When there is no more room in hell
The dead will walk the earth
Undead beings will overthrow
No government can stop their strength
Overpowering society as we know it
Zombies taking over this world
It's only a matter of time
Before we must fight
Prepare yourself for the battle
Unleashing hell onto this realm
Second dimensional apparition
Provoke hate into the mind of many
Instigate war and death to all
None shall live through this torment
