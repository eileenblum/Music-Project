The dead can live on
Passing organs to the living
Sadistic criminal minds
Placed inside the dying
The once paralyzed body
Becomes a living horror
After the skull heals
THe humanoid begins
Destined to be a carcass
The body is a liber &amp; cold
Impious brain donor
Drags the corpse to war
The birth of a zombie
Able to think &amp; move
It manipulates the frozen muscles
And gives them direction
Crippled motor function
Now active to kill
Designed for the military
These warriors walk towards
The enemy approaching
And destroy their bodies
Save their heads
For the brain to use
