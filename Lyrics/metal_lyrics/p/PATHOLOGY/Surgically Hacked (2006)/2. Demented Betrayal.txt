Demented betrayal
Living life so very frail
Afraid to breathe a deep breath
In fear that death may consume you
Hide within what you know
The evilness of everything comes toward
Unable to comprehend the magnitude
Cannot see the scale at which it stands
Ultimate degree within the depths of eternity
No bound or rules of how fast it will rise
Mathematical calculations can not predict
What lies inside our demented side
Morbid devils lunging for your soul
It is the calling that they show you
What lies inside your mind that has no title
A darkness where only the blind see
Prevent your body to be taken eternally
The mind &amp; soul must live in this existence
Cataclysmic abomination dictate change
Only demise is guaranteed so stay alive
Abysmal power will unveil the inevitable
No where to run for a safe gateway
Therei is no way out, prepare yourself
Listen for the marching of the dead
