Invoke those whom lay underground
Let then rise as they once stood
Come alive, and destroy humanity
It is not appreciated, so demolish it
Human kind does not care if it exists
Man cares for himself and no one else
Let it be done that all shall die
Feed the hate with death &amp; demise
Composition of torture and blood
Come alive and ravage the earth
Humanity must be shown what awaits
When all is gone we will want it back
Only then will the blooded be as one
Come together this entire race must
All are the same we will find
Foe to friend fight together in defense
As the globe begins to burn
Fire consumes all creatures to destroy
There will be no mercy shown to any
Prepare your self for the undead battle
Choose your weapons wisely to win
Create your platoon of armed forces
In order to defeat the wicked ones
One must become wicked in mind &amp; nature
