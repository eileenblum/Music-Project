Surgically dismembered
Manifestation of death consumes
The victim begins to feel the cold blade
Warm blood pours out of the wound
Gurgling blood, unable to breathe
Chained down ready for surgery
The body is twitching near death
Amputated limbs lying on teh ground
Abdomen open &amp; organs exposed
Heart pumping blood rapidly out of arteries
In hope of reviving the soon to be deceased
Just before passing the victim panics
Thoughts of uncontrolled magnitude
Take over as the final breath approaches
No peculiar reasoning behind this murder
One of many things may have prove valid
The killer enjoys the sight of the killing
Keeping control over the vile disorder
Abomination consumes this wicked soul
Total death the ultimate achievemente
Doubtfully the killer feels there will be more
A grotesque amount of bodies need to die
Killing is a sickness when not enjoyed
This act is satisfying to the murderer
