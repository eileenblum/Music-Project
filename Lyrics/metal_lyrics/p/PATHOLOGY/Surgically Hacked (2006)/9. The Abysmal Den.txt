Where shall I keep the bodies
Somewhere deep inside the earth
I have a place I know to take them
It is unknown to the living man
A cavern, a den for boars
They will have a feast upon delivery
Three hundred corpses will feed the horde
I am looking forward to listening
As the boars devour the dead in delight
I will record the sounds as they eat
It makes me laugh to think about
There is almost an endless supply
That I can provide for the beast
I will call this place the abysmal den
At times I wish I were one of them
Desecrating human flesh, filling on blood
It thrills me to watch the fury
Each time I give them more
Relentless attack on each other is strange
Though the feeble minded creatures breed
And I feed them more and more
