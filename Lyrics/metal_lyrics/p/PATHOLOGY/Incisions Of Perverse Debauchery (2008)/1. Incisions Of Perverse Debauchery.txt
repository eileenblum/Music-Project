The silence within darkness, is unveiled
Awaiting...
I'm decaying here in my emptiness
Perverse Debauchery
Bodies lying frozen and stained in blood
Severed limbs rotten from the Innocent
I'll fuck your corpse until it dies...
I'll fuck your religion and your so called God
Blood stains left from torture
bathing in the Indecency
loathing depravity paradox of perverse
beyond the threshold of confinement
beheading the sacraments
Dead....Arise....
lust my spoiled semen ingesting it at will
Swallowing my sins, Captive in my Tomb...
Raping the headless, keeping the bodies preserved
incisions of the vital organs
6v dying is an unholy hell
I'll Fuck, Perverse Debauchery
I'll Fuck, I'll Fuck, I'll Fuck, the bodies
half decayed in my tomb
taking the lives sealing all faith
annocucing them deceased
at the time of death there eyes look for angels
I show them possessing demons as I fuck
