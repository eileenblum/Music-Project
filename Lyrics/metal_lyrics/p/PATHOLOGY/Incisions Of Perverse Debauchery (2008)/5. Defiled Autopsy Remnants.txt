Bodies starts to rot.
The atrocity of being demolished exhumes you
organs
manifested for scientific worship
veins drain the life from a worthless
shell
Maggots feaster threw flesh
Remnants of an evil night, pale necrotic
skin
within this autopsy all will be revealed
unburied from the grave...
As
i remove the flesh, i taste the decay of the wounds
and feed off the
emptiness, buried in your spinal wretch
Bodies starts to rot
incisions so
prices, injecting viruses
Chunks of brain and skull fragments
Agony of a
peerless dementia
crapped filled piece of human shit
beaten to a
unrecognizable form
how the fuck can the cause of death be determined
putrid
autopsy of the dying race
The curse of being created exhumes you
organs eaten
fro cannibalistic worship
and instruments of removing the blood
veins drain
the sin from a worthless shell
Blistering stare into the eyes the body starts
to rot
of this formless being
devouring what is left from this
massacre
maggots fester threw flesh
witness of an evil night
with a perverse
morality to rape and kill
Deadening eyes stare at this scalpel
putting to
rest this defiled autopsy
