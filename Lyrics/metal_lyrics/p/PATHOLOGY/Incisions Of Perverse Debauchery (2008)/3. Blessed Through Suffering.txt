Soul suffering, creator of penance to exalt your sins
A faceless entity with
diabolic intent over the fallen
bound by their weakness they are
swallowed
Resurrection Denied
Blessed Savior Crucifixion
returning to their
light half alive
condemned to be lambs to wolfs
Assisted by insects, eaten by
infestations of worms
eternally decimated by the light of unholiness
Blessed
by Mutated scabs
Your god kneels before me, gutted like a martyr
and blood
slowly seeps out his gouged eyes
performing unspeakable acts of
misery
cutting out the heart for a immoral offering
Unveil suffering inhuman
creed
alive to be purified
Rotting with the fallen, begging for resurrection
