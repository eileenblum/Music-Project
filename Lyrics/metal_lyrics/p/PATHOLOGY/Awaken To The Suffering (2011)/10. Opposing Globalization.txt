We must oppose globalization.
From the complete destruction of our nation,
We must become the catalyst
For others to join force, 
To stop the oppression of our world
For it is getting smaller &amp; smaller.
Day by day, we are living in a controlled grid.
Monitored by the NSA &amp; other forms of Homeland Security.
Mother earth is on a rapid pace to decay.
We live in a festering wasteland.
This is the annihilation of humanity.
Before long this world will be laid to waste.
Countries pushing human tracking chips,
Implants tracking your every move,
A massive revolution must ensue;
So better things await. 
The future generations,
The suffering of the people is evident.
The population will have their retribution.
For the plaguing of our nations,
Overthrow the ones who hold power.
Their tyrannical rule must end now.
We must take the steps to prevent it.
As our heads are forced to bow, 
The oppressed will no longer be oppressed.
