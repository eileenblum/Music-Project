Corruption is the way of man, 
Pushed onward by humanityâs greed. 
Motivated by power over others,
We are losing our battle within 
What we think is freedom.
In the eyes of the ones in power, 
You're just another faceless name,
Another number in the flock.
The truth is you are expendable. 
Not realizing the ultimate consequence in doing so.
A sheep because of your ignorance,
You follow their orders blindly.
