Motivated by a false sense of direction. 
Pushing forward for a false sense of reality.
A complete lack of reasoning.
We must open our eyes.
To the mind-numbing shit we a forced 
To absorb from birth.
Is this because we are so vain? 
For all of its almighty power &amp; knowledge,
Why must thousands die each day? 
These prophets have not 
Answered our beckoning calls.
Why must our planet rot away?
Our faith is mere ignorance.
The abortion of procreation, 
We are the afterbirth. 
We have given way to complete self-indulgence. 
This is the era of debauchery. 
We have become numb to the ideas of 
Compassion and tolerance.
Feeding like parasites, 
This is the ingestion of false ideals &amp; morals.
