Destined for failure.
Living for nothing but ourselves.
No care or compassion for the earth
Or its inhabitants.
There is no concept for self-preservation. 
This is the dissection of our own world. 
Our living further perpetuates our 
Own depravity.
Choking on the very toxins we 
Admit into the air.
Ingesting the excrement of our 
Forefathers.
This world will soon be submerged in 
the perverse ways of humanity's filth.
