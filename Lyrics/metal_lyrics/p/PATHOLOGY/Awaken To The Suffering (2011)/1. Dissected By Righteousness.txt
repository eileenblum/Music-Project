Devoured by self-righteousness, 
We look to the sky for salvation, 
Yet you find no answers. 
Begging our false prophet for guidance, 
We gain no further wisdom of our surroundings or existence.
The greatest form of mind control. 
Religion is the highest form of intolerance. 
Some might say ignorance is bliss,
However one must be their own savior.
One must become the master of their own universe.
Mortified of the afterlife, 
We live in morbid fear,
Fear of a divine powerâs judgments.
We are on a relentless pursuit of internal happiness.
When we are truly internally suffering,
For there is no salvation.
