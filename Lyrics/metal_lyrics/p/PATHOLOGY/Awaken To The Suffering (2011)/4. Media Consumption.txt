We are bought and sold to the highest bidder.
Functioning by our own wants &amp; needs.
Media outlets owned and controlled by big business.
Feeding off our own self-indulgence.
We are whores to the corporate machine.
The machines that are running our world.
We are gluttonous in our selfishness.
Unaware of our world in peril,
Technology growing at an unfathomable rate,
The population consists of mindless sheep.
Our governments dictate our everyday needs.
The media shoves it down our fucking throats. 
Asphyxiating on our own self-indulgence, 
This is pure tyranny in the land of the free.
Buy and sell. Ingest andconsume. 
Live in Fear. Die a slave.
