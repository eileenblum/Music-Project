This is the dismemberment of humanity. 
The last sacrifice.
Weâre the excrement of the earth.
Forging our way through a cesspool
Of our own creation.
Pushing harder for self-gratifications.
Our pacifism gives way to fascism.
Making nothing better for future generations. 
Causing more death than anyone could fathom. 
Our lack of progression gives way to our oppression. 
Yet gaining nothing in the end.
A vast wasteland we tread through.
Soaking &amp; absorbing up disease. 
We are fucking parasitic.
Eating out the womb of the planet, 
Feeding off the decaying matter 
That will soon ingest us all.
