Disgusting in nature. 
Reduced to wallowing in filth.
Humanity has always been a waste of space.
Yours and my existence are nothing in the grand 
Scheme of it all.
Pushing further and further towards a 
Predetermined end. 
Ending humanityâs wretched existence on this planet. 
Succumbing to the plague of which the human race 
Has come to be.
A truly diseased creature,
We will ruin anything of the purest nature,
Without realizing what destruction we are 
Unleashing upon ourselves.
Disease overwhelms the population.
Pollution fills the air.
But we are the pollution.
We are the disease
