The ancient gods were of flesh and blood
We are bio-engineered products of another race
What is time and did it begin
We are just products of another created mind

Of all that separates us until we die
The earth and heavens meet on a horizon of time
Under a new kingdom we watch as they come
From the sky we are products of another time

The epic of creation
Circles and embraces
Our orbits and cycles
That we have created

Legacy Of The Ancients

Sin the illuminator of the night

Of all that separates us until we die
What is time and how did it begin
Look to the ancientsâ texts the stones inscribed
Legacy of the ancients and the horizon of time
