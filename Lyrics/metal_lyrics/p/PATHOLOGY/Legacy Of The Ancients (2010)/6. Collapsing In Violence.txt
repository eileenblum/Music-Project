Tyranny of the majority is common law
Indirect democracy
Legions of ruling mob
Trampled beat bludgeoned
Silence critical mass
Collapsing in violence
Disposing of monarchy
Tyranny of the majority
Ruling mob
Trampled beat bludgeoned
Silence critical mass

Appealing to majority religion exists
There must be a god
Appealing to majority only astrology exists

Exists...
No God...

No God...
Exists...

Mob rule crucify disobedient
Discovered the pursuit of truth

Enter the communion
Mob rule
Tyranny trampled beat
Bludgeoned
