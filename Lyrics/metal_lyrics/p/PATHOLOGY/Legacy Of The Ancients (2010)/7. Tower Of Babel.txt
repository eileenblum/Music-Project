Let us revolt
Confusion of tongues
Have brought the flood of ecstasy
A figure of speech
Let us behold
The gale of judgment

How divine is intervention
Clouded is the holy rebellion
Genesis the texts of forgery
King over all gods
Marduk
Clouded is the unholy rebellion
Genesis the texts of forgery
King over all

The Tower of Babel curse
Stand at the gates not to be judged

How divine is intervention
Let us revolt
Confusion of tongues
The culture of Sumer is lost
Let us revolt
Confusion of tongues

The Tower of Babel
The Tower of Babel

How divine intervention
Clouded is the holy rebellion
Genesis the texts of forgery
King over all
Marduk

The Tower of Babel
The Tower of Babel
