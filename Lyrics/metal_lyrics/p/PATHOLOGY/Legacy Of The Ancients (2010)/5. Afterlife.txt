His head was that of a falcon not man
Horus
He is the horizon Attis dead for 3 days
Born of a virgin Krishna resurrected once again
Dionysus performed miracles
Mithra the king of kings

Set the conqueror - Underworld
Set the conqueror - Afterlife
Afterlife...

Buried without darkness
The parallels we see
Not to admit truth begins
Buried with darkness
The objects I cannot see
Set to be bled truth

Set the conqueror - Underworld
Set the conqueror - Afterlife

I will see you in the afterlife
In the Afterlife...

As I bleed onto this Earth
Set to conquer my underworld
As you bleed onto this crust
Set to conquer the afterlife
