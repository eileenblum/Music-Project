13 bloodlines dominate
Reptilian control is eminent
Elected by bloodlines
Convincing all of democracy
Blood runs
Reptilian control is eminent
Blood runs
Elected by bloodlines

The veils we wear are so dark
The elite know of this illusion
The same blood runs through all the veins
The veils we wear we cannot see
The same blood runs through their veins
Illuminati and infinite awareness

As shape shifting calls
Eyes turn to black
And then back again
Blood runs through to dominate
Blood runs
Family
