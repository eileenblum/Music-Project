Dwelling in the path with no air
Reaching above the sky
Stars collapse and a hole
Is formed where the light escapes
Entering this new dimension
Where spirits roam and battle
For who rules this space
Of chaos- enter the reign
Above atmosphere
The hourglass define a spectrum
But strangely no color exists
Creating your own propulsion
Running from minions of dark
Awaken from slumber but still
Falling into nightmares I realize
This sleep is forever
Residual hauntings often repeat history
Above atmosphere
