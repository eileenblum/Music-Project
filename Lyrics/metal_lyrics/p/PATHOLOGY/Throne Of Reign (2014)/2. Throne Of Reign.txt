A forsaken wind blows to the north
Remembering a time when blood runs
Upon this throne of reign
Behold for my legacy is forever
ruling with iron- a democracy lifted
For word is stone and all who oppose
Will see eternal sleep
Throne of reign- as the ancients rise
The trees tell of whats the come
Impaled souls rise only to be damned
An offspring born to rule as
The chosen- we teach the break
We teach to lie and by the passing
Of solstice winter comes late
And the sun takes a bleak
Color for none shall be born free
As the ancients rise- throne of reign
