A line is formed preparing for blood
Battle cries can be heard over mountains
Formations incoming following the storm
We call upon krum for his steel
The dogs run first over the hills
Through winds come spirits of past
No losses for the weary
The chain-mail starts to wear heavy
How we must rule over this land
Our ruler will sacrifice to the Gods
Strength and honor as the dismembering begins
From the north we harness energy
We stack the bodies in ritualistic manners
As warning to those who come late
Strength and honor- from the north we reign
