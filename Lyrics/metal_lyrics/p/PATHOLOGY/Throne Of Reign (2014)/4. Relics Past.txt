In the waves lye voices of
Yesterday answering questions from past
Lives- lost is the communication
Only time stops from decayed visions
Hearing the questions of the living
Energy must not die only
Transfers to another after
Separations- they break barriers
Of sound and deception
Now we must listen between the
Static as the answers to all
Given in confidence why must
We seek this place of black
Dwelling in-between frequencies
Of the other side and a rush
From the presence roars
Cries can only be heard
In this space from relics past
