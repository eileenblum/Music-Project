Leaders of power gather around fire
Planning a demise of our blood
Poising the food supply as
The depopulation commence
Minimize your volatility
Maximize your gain
Our meetings in the woods
Must end with sacrifices
To the seeing eye for our
Reign is coming sooner than later
Enter our new rituals of blasphemy
Vast disagreements will end with pain
Now back at this alter
With power all as hostility sets
In the masoney- peace not
To be believed and darkness
Has befallen on us all
Now and ever
