Entering the void- veal covered eyes
Ending a nightmare after the storm
Awake and conscious your memories
Run red- organs are replaced
Now the harvest ha succumb to deities
And sacrifices are inevitable
Burnt offerings remain a constant
The weak have delivered us
Below the sky they roam the netherworld
Wandering and hunting- lust for flesh
Above the sky they roam the astral plane
Hunting the flesh- lust for bone
After the silence we can hear the
Afterlife- delivered from the four winds
The weak have delivered us
Below the sky becomes the netherworld
Remembering deliverance
Harvest
