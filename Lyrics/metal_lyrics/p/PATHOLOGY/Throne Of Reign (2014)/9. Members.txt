She had to die
There will be more
Bates had to die
There will be more
I like killing people
Because it is so much fun
Wild game in the forest
Because man is the most
Dangerous animal of all
To kill something gives me
The most thrilling experience
It is even better than getting
Your rocks off with a girl the
Best part of it is that when I die
I will be reborn in Paradise and
They have killed will become
My slaves I will not give you
My name because you will try to
Slow down or atop my collection
Of slaves for my afterlife
