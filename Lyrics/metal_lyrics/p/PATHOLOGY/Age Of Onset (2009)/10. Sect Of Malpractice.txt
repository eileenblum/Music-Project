Founding principles of code
Gathered are the loyal followers
The luminary rules all
Below the horizon
A nocturnal sect begins

Sect Of malpractice

Gathered to watch
The offered sacrifice
Lacerations begin

On the face
As the feet are removed
The body preped for draining
A unique access to truth or salvation
Mounting the high tension
Luminary rulers pray

Sect of malpractice
Founding principles of code
Gathered are the loyal followers
The luminary rules all
Below the horizon
A nocturnal sect begins
