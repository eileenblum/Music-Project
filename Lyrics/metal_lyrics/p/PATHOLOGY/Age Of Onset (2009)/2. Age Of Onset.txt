Illnessâ¦
...sickness
Diseasedâ¦disorder
Abnormalâ¦pathogen
Pathogenâ¦infection
Walk
With the infected hosts
Parasites bore through lungs and viens
Walk with the
Infected hosts
Parasites mutate â transmitting disease
Age of onset
As we
Breath
We transmit this disease
Aiding life for a virus
That over comes
As
We breath
More silent we become
This visus taken
Over me
Blackened
Onset
Age of onset
