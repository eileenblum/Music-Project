Scholars of torture
Governments re â education
Thru confession and suffering
Practice arts of the immoral
Racks aligned
To seek the truth

Scholars of torture
Realign the axis

Motivation for torture
Alignment is neutral
They come for blood
And marrow â drain
The eyes re manufacture

Breaking and filing
Down to dust
Viscera expels
The cavity
Now open
Viscera expels
