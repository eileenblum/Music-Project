Sick of living
Unwilling to die
Cut
Clean
If red
Clean
Blood spurting
Dripping . . . spilling
Spilling . . .dripping

All over her new dress
Oh well it was red
Anyway . . .
Dripping . . . spilling
Spilling . . .dripping

Life draining into
An uncertain death

She won't die this time
Somebody will find her
Just wait till next time
ZODIAC
