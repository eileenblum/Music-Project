Host carry emyos - A fetus mutates
Gestation Begins again
Hormones injected to birth more meat
Gestation Begins again

Stacking the mothers
One by one
Disease growing at rabid levels
No parts of the sick
Go to waste
Gestation Begins...

Hormone residues open sores
Internal bleeding....

Forced to produce unnatural quantites
No more is the natural cycle

Mastitis bacteria infection - the udder
dramatic deformation antibiotic cells

Host carry emyos - A fetus mutates
Gestation Begins again
Hormones injected to birth more meat
Gestation Begins again

Gestation Begins
Breathing life into
New forms
Gestation Begins Again
