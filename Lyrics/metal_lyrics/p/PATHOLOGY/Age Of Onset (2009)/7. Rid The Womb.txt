As I plant my seed
Into your womb
Into your womb
I plant my seed

The reaction gestates
Partial hemorrhaging incurres
Rid the womb

Stomachs pulsate and contract
Inards- inards- inards - gone

As I plant my seed
Into your womb
Into your womb
I plant my seed

As you lay opened up
Viscera fills your mouth
Twenty one grams you leave
Your soul to peace . . .

Breathing- gasping
Gasping- choking
