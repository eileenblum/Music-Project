A ceremony of control from dynasty we reign
Commonwealth are the cardinals - the King is now dead

Now we ascend the throne - as nations lie
At our feet
Installation of succession as we install the children
Installation of blood I command empires to rise
Now we ascend the throne - as monarchs
Lie at our feet

I command thee to rise as I pass the throne below 
Installation of alien blood flows through oceans and seas

Proximity of blood
As the elders
Make sacrifice
To the Lords
Monarch blood
