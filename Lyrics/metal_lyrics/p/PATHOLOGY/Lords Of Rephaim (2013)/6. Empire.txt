two thirds god one third of man
enkidu - seven day - the night watchman
for the lord has dreams of disembowelment
upon cedar mountain the omen revealed
the forest guardian quickly approaches
to raise the dead and devour the living
my throne of empire

twelve tablets unfold
the future of the netherworld
shepherds guard sheep
as dark takes the light

arise from the empire
only to cheat death
we come with dirt
for building the afterlife

stand and listen the ghosts
speak in tongue
shepherds slaughter sheep
blood runs through the stones
at your feet
empire
