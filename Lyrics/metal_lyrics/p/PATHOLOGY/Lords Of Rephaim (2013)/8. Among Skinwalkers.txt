As we collect from the ranch-Skinwalkers again appear
Discovering circles and triangles of glass
Awaken to mutilations
The cattle disappear with no trace
Unseeable energy lurks above

Where are they from
And why are they here
The truth so elusive and near

The lights that still haunt us mortals
Skinwalkers again appear
Awaken to mutilations
Now standing over the ground
A strange chemical odor present
Unseeable the energy still lurks above
Awaken to enlightenment

Skinwalker-Awaken to mutilation
Skinwalker-Awaken to enlightenment
