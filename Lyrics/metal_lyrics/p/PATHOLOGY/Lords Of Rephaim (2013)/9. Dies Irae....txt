Upon the mountain of the dead
Lye the Lords of Rephaim
With there excisions of the cryptique
Inscribe dead commandments

For this empire we create from
Ascending below we walk
Among skinwalkers and their souls

Its in the blood
The reign from above leads us towards
The path of the divine for the final
Code injection
