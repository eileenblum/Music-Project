Hail to thee, great God, Lord of the two truths.
I have come unto thee, my Lord, that thou mayest
bring me to see thy beauty, I know thee, I know
Thy name, I know the names of the 42 Gods
Who are with thee in this broad hall of the two 
Truths...Behold, I am come unto thee. I have brought
Thee truth; I have done away with sin for thee, I have not sinned against anyone. I have no mistreated people. 
I have not done evil instead of righteousness...I have
Not reviled the god. I have not killed; I have not 
Turned anyone over to a killer. I have no caused anyone's
Suffering...I have not increased nor diminished
The measure, I have not diminished the palm; I have
Not encroached upon the fields. I have
Not added to the balance weights; I have not tempered with
The plumb bob of the balance. I have taken milk From a child's mouth; I have not stopped the flow of water in its 
Seasons; I have not built a dam again flowing water.
I have not quenched a fire in its time...I have not kept cattle away from the God's property. I have not blocked 
The God at his processions.
