As we being decomposition a phenomena
With surgical precision unfolds as
Organs and intestines taken revealing no
Evidence of entry with no bleeding
And flesh taken with loss of cutting
Bovine excision

Bovine excision
Unnatural mutilations

For we do not understand this force
A collection of eyes and tongues ensues
The destruction of red blood cells
With no tracks only radiation

Bovine excisions unnatural mutilation
From above they harvest there hormones
Bovine excisions unnatural mutilation
Experimental reproduction harvest the blood
