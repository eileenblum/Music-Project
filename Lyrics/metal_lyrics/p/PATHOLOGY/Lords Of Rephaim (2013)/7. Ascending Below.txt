Three hundred stay in Heaven
Three hundred sent to Earth
They raised the head above the shrine
Where the children wait
The gatekeeper of the Abzu
Through the temple of Eridu
Ascending through below

Ascending below

As he pursues the tablets of destiny
Rain falls of thunderbolts
Lords of Lords
Reviver of dead

Gather the four winds
Stand and be judged
Lord of Lords-Ascending to below
A great flood-Ascending to below

Destruction of the winds
A King brings salvation
Ascending to below
Ascending from below
