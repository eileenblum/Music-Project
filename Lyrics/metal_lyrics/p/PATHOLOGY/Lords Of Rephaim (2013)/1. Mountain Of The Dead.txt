Descending upon the Ics as winter arrives
In Darkness
They cut from the inside to escape
The Night

Skin changed to the dark
Clothes filled with radiation
Orange lights from the sky
Fall from north

Mount of the dead
Fall from north

Hypothermia
Fractured skulls
Hypothermia
And tongue removed

Disorientated from heat loss
Death has come from above
As we lye in the north
Ready to see the other side
Frozen with fear our lives
Lost and covered
From this side to the other
