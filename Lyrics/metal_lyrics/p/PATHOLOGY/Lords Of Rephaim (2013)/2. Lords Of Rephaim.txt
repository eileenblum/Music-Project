As we walk in the iron age of the netherrealm
To the valley of Rephaim
Ancient walk with the dead will rise
On this side or the other

Thee dead kings read execration texts of the
forgotten kingdom-Lords of Rephaim
Now we stand to be judged by the suns
of Anak-Lords of Rephaim

Lords of Rephaim

Our ravens cries can not be heard
For we are chosen by the grain

Lords of Rephaim
Drink from the quays
