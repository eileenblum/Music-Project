To bring forth consciousness and dark
The smoke will hide the light of the serpent
And from the central realm we spread the seed
Wisdom we now gain the prophesies
And the Karma will be felt
The enter the path of the divine
Or left to wander the netherrealm
With infinite space - path of the divine

On the second day will beget
A pure form travels through water
On the third day elemental Earth bleeds
Through creating the path of the divine

Produced by the dark passion we wander
The six bodhic deities appear unto thee
Lead us to the shrine in this darkness we bask
As wolves among sheep we have wandered
