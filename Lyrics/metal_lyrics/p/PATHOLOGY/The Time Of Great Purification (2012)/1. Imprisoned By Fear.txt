Imprisoned by society's follies,
Entombed in our own self destruction,
At the end of our time,
We will have no resurrection.
From our lives of continual suppression,
Our liberties open to the powers of dissection,
We've laid down our individuality,
All in the name of corporate greed,
This is quickly becoming our darkest hour,
Further letting those control us by their power,
Fear consuming our every move,
No matter what path we choose,
We're doomed with all certainty,
By the way our world is heading currently,
The end draws near,
We are the disease.
