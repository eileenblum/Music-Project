Your very existence disgusts me
The concept of you further polluting humanity's
Cespool makes me hate the idea of my remaining time.
Complete chaos and total destruction occurs.
Purging you of any self-worth,
Creating our own hell on earth,
Humanity is a malignant tumor upon this planet.
We continue to pollute the air we breathe,
Choking on our own wants and needs,
Completely overruled by our greed.
Gouging Earth of its valuable resources,
Only contributing to our capitalistic gains,
While the ones behind the curtain make millions,
Living in ignorant bliss, not even seen as citizens.
Turning our backs to the everlasting problems
That lie at our feet.
The decent into depravity is quickly approaching,
Your very existence disgusts me,
The concept of you further polluting humanity's
Cespool makes me hate the idea of my remaining time.
