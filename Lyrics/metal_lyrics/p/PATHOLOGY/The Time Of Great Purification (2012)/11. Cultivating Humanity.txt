A harvest of our species, chaos weeps from the skies.
Acid rain rotting away our civilizations,
Ash blankets the landscape,
Cities lie in ruins,
Pollution clogging the very air we breathe.
A cultivation of the human race,
Sold into slavery.
Sold to the highest bidder,
Forced into work camps,
Like the final solution.
Work will never make us free,
Losing more and more everyday,
We only further our decay.
The Earth is barren and mutilated to no end.
Further and further humanity descends,
Now we pay the ultimate price,
All for the final sacrifice.
