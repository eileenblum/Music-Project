Controlled by these martyrs ideals and beliefs,
The righteous of this world feed off our weaknesses.
Raping away our inner strength,
Living our lives in constant fear,
Judging those whom we don't see fit.
Oppression by faith,
Casting out that which we don't understand.
Once our time is over,
We will not find our salvation,
Fearing eternal damnation and torment.
Don't allow oneself to be poisoned by these fables
And lies.
Deny the claims that your life is not your own.
Rely on oneself and not that of a so-called martyr.
Do not believe what has been forced into you.
Be your own saviour, be your own master,
Our heads will not be forced.
Reject the false ideals that are pushed,
Our knees will not be bent.
Controlled by these martyrs ideals and beliefs,
The righteous of this world feed off our weaknesses.
Raping away our inner strength,
Living our lives in constant fear.
