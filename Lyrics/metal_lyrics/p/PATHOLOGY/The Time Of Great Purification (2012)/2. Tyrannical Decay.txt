Overthrow the ones who hold power,
Their tyrannical rule must end now.
We must take the steps to prevent it,
As our heads are forced to bow.
The oppressed will no longer be oppressed,
We shall rise becoming the rulers of a new era.
No longer starving,
No longer hopeless,
No longer suffering.
We shall rise becoming the rulers of a new era.
We won't be another faceless name.
Fighting for the air we breathe,
Poisoned by the bullshit we're fed.
In most aspects we are already dead.
We have been victimized for simply living.
Forced into civilizations of slums and poverty,
Not just a doe in this plane of existence.
No longer starving,
No longer hopeless,
No longer suffering.
The oppressed will no longer be oppressed.
