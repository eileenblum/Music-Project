Forced into hiding, from this global uprising,
Feeding off the filth from eons of oppression,
It's been there all along,
A bleak future for the future generations,
Becoming more and more evident every day.
The ones in power continue to take,
As they further their rape,
Of all that is around us.
I cannot find trust,
With those who govern over us,.
Minds are festered with ignorance,
Ripping away the innards of our liberties,
Defecating on the futures of the youth and elderly,
Lives are corrupted by complete self-indulgence,
Human life seen as another dollar sign,
And another mind left to destroy,
And another body left to exploit.
A bleak future,
We are nothing of value,
We are nothing but slaves,
A bleak future.
Forced into hiding, from this global uprising,
Feeding off the filth from eons of oppression.
