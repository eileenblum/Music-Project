Suffocated by the lies that are shoved
Down our throats.
Go to work, to earn nothing.
Survival being impossible,
Take the fucking hint.
Open your eyes and minds,
You've been ingesting their filth and lies,
The ending of existence.
What we have become is truly sickening,
Festering in our own self-consumption.
This is the genocide of our self-awareness,
What we are is grotesque in every way,
This is the rape of your freedoms,
Where there is life, death is short behind.
Forging our way through the sludge
And disgusting ideas and mindsets we keep,
I can only hope that life on this dismal
Planet ends soon, our place and
Life on this Earth is overdue.
