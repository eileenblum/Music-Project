2012 The end of days to come,
The earth will regain all its control,
Swallowing up our putrid species,
Nothing will be left of what was.
Cities becoming wastelands,
Let the chaos reign.
Humanity will be no more.
Finally ridding the earth of the everlasting plagues we've created,
What we've worked so hard to create
Will be laid to waste.
It will be but a footnote in the chapters of time,
All that once was will be destroyed,
There will be no salvation,
There is no hope,
The extinction draws near,
There is no hope.
A complete loss, a hopeless cause,
There is no progress.
A lifetime full of regrets,
The blood is on our hands,
With no way to wash ourselves of the
Errors of our ways,
This is the end of days
