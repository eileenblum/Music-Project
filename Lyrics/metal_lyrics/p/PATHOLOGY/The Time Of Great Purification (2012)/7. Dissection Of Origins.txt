A blast from within the cosmos,
A catastrophic eruption of life forms,
The origins of the species descending from the stars,
Creating new life on a once docile planet.
Where did we begin? Where do we end?
The answers lie within the galaxies that dies
Off millions of years before the dawn of man.
Visitations by other intelligent life,
Suggest we are not alone in this world,
We are a small speck in a infinite and
Never ending plane of existence.
Since the time of man we've always looked to the skies,
Asking the questions, why are we here?
What lies ahead?
Perhaps there's something to our existence here,
A foreign reasoning of humanity's place on Earth.
