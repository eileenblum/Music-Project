[performed by Philip H. Anselmo &amp; the Illegals]Rise again to face the day
With a knife in my back in my spine mind(!)
Insults my life (my)name (my) rage
And bites like pain a war conflict
Is it a price? is it a curse?
Spasms swell like rock i turn to
Stone and then i'm at
Home low dire spiteful
Resentment breeds profound conflict
How long can this go on?

Conflict conflicting conflict
Post-op regret
Conflict conflicting conflict
Recovery slip
Conflict conflicting conflict
A pause for the betterment
Conflict conflicting conflict
Dwell on the negative
I am the one the decider i am a pun the destroyer
Buried inside like a time bomb i am a
Blitzkrieg made of one

I am the stunned and the stunted i define
Fury as in furious
Damage the face ball up the name given
The kiss of chronic pain

Tazed awake every fucking day of
My life nerve damage screams in
Waves as i lie ass back
Flat the stab the control the tripwire
conflict
How far deep is this scar?
Thrashing under pariah smoke stained
Sheets hoping somehow someone might
See my arm waving a flag of
Surrender i'm, m.i.a. in conflict
Is it mistake was it on purpose to
Try and keep me in check?

COnflict conflicting conflict
3-level fuse
Conflict conflicting conflict
Titanium screws
Conflict conflicting conflict
Rebuild the veteran
Conflict conflicting conflict
Dwell on the negative

I am the one the excluded i am an animal
That's been wounded
My insignificance is significant tirade in
Flight wings spanned
I cannot fly without looking down
I cannot fly

Conflict conflicting conflict
3-pills a pop
Conflict conflicting conflict
Titanium clock
Conflict conflicting conflict
Ruin the veteran
Conflict conflicting conflict
Dwell on the negative!
