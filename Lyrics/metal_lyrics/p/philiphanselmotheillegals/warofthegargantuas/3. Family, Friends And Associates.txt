[performed by Philip H. Anselmo &amp; the Illegals]Do you need attention?
Do you crave sympathy?
Are you the one rejected?
What color do you bleed?
Is it the same as me? I see red.

Do you conceal compulsion?
Do you worry needlessly?
Are you intolerant?
What can you suck for free?
What color do you bleed?
What can you steal from me?
What color do you bleed?
I see red.

I'm calling you out.
Just disposition to favors.
I'm calling you out.
Is this the moment you... live?

Do you feel all alone?
Are you afraid of it?
Do you feel suicide?
What can you suck from this?
What can you steal from me?
What color do you bleed? What color do you bleed?
I see red.

I'm calling you out.
Just disposition from favors.
I'm calling you out.
Is this the second you.... live?
It's the one time I call bullshit.
