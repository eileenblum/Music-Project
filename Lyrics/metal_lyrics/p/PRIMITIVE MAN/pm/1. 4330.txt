you'll end up alone in the end
dead and alone
the father forever unsafe
from my grasp
unsafe from dying in that shithole house
the captain of our block
corner of hell
your guilt rid soul stabbed
head as pulp
spitting up in confusion
I am at a loss for words
there is no solution
burn
all this smoke and intolerance
let time burn your name from my memory
let the dirt return to you
the the kingdom of dead pigs and shit
a grave for your future
a grave for your fucking offspring
dig
you piece of shit
