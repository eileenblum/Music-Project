your life-a price tag your value-nothing expendable enslaved to die 
or not to die with a trash bag around your head and someone elseâs legacy all over your inner thighs life is fucking rape life is fucking turmoil this is the reality we live in dog fucks dog fleas blind and eat dog sounds and color of the world everything is fucking dark dense as the tick infestation in my fucking ears end over end chained and cut half open strung out and strangled a mass of burning hell
