[performed by Primitive Man]alone in the end dead alone totaled darkness forever living
shit breathing shit as a slave to city pigs such continuity
my eyes have opened black opaque vision of a non stop
loathing sold as I am writhing in a rot I cannot escape
in this hell I have stood with them but only as adversary
