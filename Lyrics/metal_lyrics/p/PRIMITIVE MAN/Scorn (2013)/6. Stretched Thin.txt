I'll hold the black urn in the desert tonight. With bones in my pocket and hell in my mind. They'll never find me. They'll never find the rotten piece inside of me that hides in your mind. I walk alone in darkness. Sheltered from the light with cancer on my soul. A victim of the life. I live high and filled with scorn, fed up and raw. Hate everything. Hate everyone. I have forgotten how to live.
