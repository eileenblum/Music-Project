Total lack of forgiveness. My hooves trample on their skulls. The crushing sound of intolerance. Eradication. Annihilation. Exsanguination. Detestation. Smothered with fucking scorn. I have news for you bastards. No one is listening. No one fucking cares. Fuck your fucking clubs, your false sense of entitlement. Fuck your fucking fashion show. Young man, do your time. Walk a mile in my shoes. Scorn. Revenge. Hate. Ruin. Scorn.
