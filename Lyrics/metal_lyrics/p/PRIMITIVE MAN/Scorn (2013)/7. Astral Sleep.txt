We only exist together in an astral sleep. Hand in hand in our psalms, the blood of the earth smearing grave dirt. Dead flesh rests on my bones with a dormant soul, imprisoned where no heart beats. Dead and fucked up. How can I continue to live in this ruin? Unable to suppress the creature in me, left tattered and forever alone. Stay fucked. Stay fucked up.
