My hell lives inside of a brick house. Windowless, full of noise that bleeds out from the bullet hole in the sides of my fucking head. You motherfucks. I'm done. A curse on your fucking head. Your blood on my hands. Years of self-sacrifice, years of cleaning up your mess. Fucking ungrateful. Every fucking sub-group from cardigans to leather vests, you're all fucking shit. And I'm fucking buried in it. All I have left is short of the Grave. I am penniless and fucked up. Empty. Half of my fucking will sucked out. You're all shit. And I'm fucking buried. I HATE. From cardigans to leather vests, you're all shit. Heart hard as stone. Black as crow. I reject them. All I have left is my balls and my word.
