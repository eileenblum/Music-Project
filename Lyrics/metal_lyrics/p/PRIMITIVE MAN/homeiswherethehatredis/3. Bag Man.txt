it is all I have
a life wasting away
Iâm covered with sores
a symptom of my loss
a chain over the neck
of the fucking bagman
Iâll just smoke to dust
to dust
a toast to my alcoholism
a smoke to my struggle bag man
witness
no one around me to relate to this
the sting of all wounds stain my world black
my only companion
in this fucking nightmare
is the darkness I conceal the sting of all wounds stains me with blood

in over my head
in this life as trash
trash
raped
discarded
filled with
the stone that is my heart submerged
chained
to a life
of nothingness
my hate is real
my hate is me
die slow
