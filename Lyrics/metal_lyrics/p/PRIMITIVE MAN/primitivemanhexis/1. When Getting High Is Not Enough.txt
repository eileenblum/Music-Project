[performed by Primitive Man]swing low, sweet gun metal
the symptoms of life have always been
the closer to death i get the further i see
redemption starts in my gut
a forever "fuck you"
let's have a toast to how life has always been shit
swing low sweet gun metal
shackle bound, chained to the slums
and smother with an American flag
pain//loss
