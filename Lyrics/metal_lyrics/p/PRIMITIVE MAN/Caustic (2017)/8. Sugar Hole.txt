My will is falling out

I've gnashed my teeth to dust
Weigh my pieces out
Let me return to earth
To the soil
Inside of a disgusting fucking mask

The same ones I have to adapt
Day in/day out
Separate the skin from my bones
Peel me away
A scab's life

I pissed my youth away
And the adult world has swept me into the gutter
