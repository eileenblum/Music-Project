Hold me under the threshold

Of the festering wound
The grows between us
All infected chasms
Blend into a single wound
This is what we are
A flaccid and pathetic mess
Fed on sterility
And the proite of a better future
So I held my breath

And here I am a fucking ghost
Wrecked
I am held under and doomed to live
Off the shit in this trough
Trash that grows between us
Out of a single wound
This is what we are
