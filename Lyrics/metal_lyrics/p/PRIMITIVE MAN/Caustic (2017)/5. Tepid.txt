There is a time
That stands still
When the needle breaks
And vibrates the frequency of our death

Human light burned out

Sucked into my tepid void

Hide your fucking eyes

My sad cock in the mouth of eternity

A gang bang with reality
Coldly fucking everyone your whole life

There's not enough smoke in the world
To help me bury the last 33 years

Of axes ground into concrete
And bouquets made of skulls
