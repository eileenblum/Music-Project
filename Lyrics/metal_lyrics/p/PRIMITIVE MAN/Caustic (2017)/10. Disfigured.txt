The year of the tomb
Cold hearts living in fear together
The slave blood in me waits
For the sack cloth moon

Draped over the disfigured face of humanity
My gnashing teeth

Chewing wildly
Wet from death's sugar hole
Generation's left to fill this oblivion
But that's how this fucking species does it
A cyclical death in a child's eyes
The world tomb for all shades
For what I am and what dies in me
Great grandmother a slave
Though light skinned
I will never be free
But never a slave
A ghost and an alien
Eviscerated by race relations
And shame in my heart
From when they fucking spit on me
