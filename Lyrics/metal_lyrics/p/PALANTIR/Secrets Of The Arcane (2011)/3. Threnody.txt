As I raised my blade to face my final foe
I was shown the true daunt of my weakness
Her sirenic gaze transformed a fiend to a lover
a contagion to a cure
for all my world's pain I couldn't endure
At first taste of her I set my bridge ablaze
I watched it fade to a small glow

Why did you choose me and let me live?

Bound in your chains
my flesh is easily cut
You've extinguished my flame
Your black hand shrouds my soul from what it once was
united with trees, the mountains and rivers
I burn the homes of my kin
because you've pit me against them
I grant a vacant stare
to this bare exposition
I can't remember the last time I've slept without you
You've forced me this way

Your poison courses my veins more than my own blood
as you make yourself all I can reach
My strength has surrendered to your being
I am here but not fighting
I can see that I'm dying
as your arrows rip through my flesh
