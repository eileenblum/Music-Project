The tree
older than the flesh
mightier than the animal king
bends with her breathing
rips away with a whisper

The Stone
older than the roots
mightier than the legions of man
returns to dust
as her fingers exfoliate the Earth

The threat moves on
though her song still sounds in the mountains
the sun begins to burn through
its black veil
animals creep from dens
they are drawn by the roar of the river

She has granted
the hand of life
a gift for all to drink
what was brown becomes green
what were seeds become trees

The storm feeds the river!
