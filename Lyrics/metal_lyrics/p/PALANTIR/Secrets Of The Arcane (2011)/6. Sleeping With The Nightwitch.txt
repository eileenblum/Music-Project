How far have you come?
While hunter's mouths of steel teeth remain open and hungry
silent killers still strung on bows
Your fur has made no coat

I am pulled from sleep
as your howl sounds again
closer than the nights before
Just then a red mist lets itself in
under the door

I reach for the hidden dagger
as the mist grows
to a woman in a black robe
suddenly the blade is wrenched from my grip and buries itself in the wall
her commanding stare stays me

and to my wonder she lets her robe free
yielding her white beauty
the last uncovered treasure of the Earth
for my eyes to see
she places her hands on her breasts
as she descends upon me
she doesn't speak
but her eyes scream in ecstasy
the sweat of our intimacy flows into pools
like secret fountains of our majesty

and in the flesh we were married
she begged I grant her my seed before leaving
I am left with a cherished memory
alas, the moment was fleeting
