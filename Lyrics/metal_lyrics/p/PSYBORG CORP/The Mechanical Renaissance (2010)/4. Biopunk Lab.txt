[Alex Jones sample â Bioweapons and the New World Order]

They wanna kill us and theyâre in bioweapons labs
And theyâre building 36 level 4 bioweapons labs and their bioshield
And then I criticise them so I get their graduate students going
âHereâs my paper on humans being a parasite, I canât wait till weâre all dead!
By the way I work in a bioweapons laboratory, hehehehe!!â

We're falling in, genetic disorder
Bringing the pest and disease
Bio-protection division,
Experimental industries
Defense, against, a bio-war
Desaparece pandemia
Pathogen: virus bacteria
Possible threat of asphyxia

Exterminated by silence,
Eradicating the use of madness
Obliterating abuse,
Science-fights-science
In biopunk lab!

Breathing again, the polluted air
Atmosphere dammed by debris
Humans are facing extinction
Environmental casualties

Sickness remains, to die for
CÃ¡ncer de la nueva era
Laboratory develops
La cura termina la guerra

Exterminated by silence,
Eradicating the use of madness
Obliterating abuse,
Science-fights-science
In biopunk lab!

[Alex Jones sample â BioShield, Eugenics, Government wants you to die.]

You understand me boy!?
This isnât a joke, this is for real!
Now let tell you something in your gut
You know deep in your cowardly gut,
You know Iâm telling the truth right now.

Exterminated by silence,
Eradicating the use of madness
Obliterating abuse,
Science-fights-science
In biopunk lab!

[Alex Jones sample â BioShield, Eugenics, Government wants you to die.]

The government is run by psycho-killers you understand!?
They like killing you,
They like killing me,
They like poisoning your water,
They like playing God,
They like running it all.
