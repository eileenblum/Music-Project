Doomsday device.
From technology, nanofactory
Microscopical agent,
Created to multiplicate.
Seeds built in hatred,
Single creation of a self-replication;
Assembling control,
Molecular mutation spreading the plague.

DEATH REPLICATORS!
MASS REPLICATION-
INFINITE NANOTECH

Small, molecular manufacture
Nanothreat assemblers
Distorted reality
Complex devices, on their own
Consuming the planet as life turns to grey

Prey of criminal corporations
Self pretention, for the sake
Of the nation (alien nation)
Out of control no turning back
Nanomachine weapons - surprise attack

DEATH REPLICATORS!
MASS REPLICATION-
INFINITE NANOTECH

Ghost of life is now devoured
By something called nanotechnology
Tiny machines that were designed
To save the human race,
But instead they turned on us.

DEATH REPLICATORS!
MASS REPLICATION-
INFINITE NANOTECH / GREY GOO SUPREMACY!
