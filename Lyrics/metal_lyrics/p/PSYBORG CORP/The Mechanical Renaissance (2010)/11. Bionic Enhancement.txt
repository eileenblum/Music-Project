[Sample from Isaac Asimovâs Visions of the Future]

But actually any machine thatâs computerizedâ¦is a robot.
Weâve discovered a machine that can substitute at least in part for the human brain.
(Furthermore, computers are not just immobile things, because) you can hook computers up to machinery, and have, the machinesâ¦that spare human muscles, also act in such a way, in such a versatile way, that they seem to beâ¦thinking: you have artificial intelligence applied to machines and we call them robots. In science fiction youâll always think of robots as manlike, metallic creatures, but actually any machine thatâs computerized, is a robot, and we have industrial robots, right now, that donât look the least bit like human beings, and yet that do things that until just a couple of decades ago, only human beings could do, and weâre going to live in a future perhaps, in which we will have personal robots as well; robots that do look like human beings, and that replace for the first timeâ¦what we, used to call slaves, serves, servantsâ¦aaaandâ¦free a soul, for the first time weâre going to be free-really-truly-free, humanity is a whole!
