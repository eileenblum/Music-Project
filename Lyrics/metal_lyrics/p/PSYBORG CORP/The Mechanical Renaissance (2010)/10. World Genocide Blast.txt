FIRE!
Holograms projected from the Atomic age
Below the atmosphere, flying bombers
Recalls thermonuclear memories
Fueled by scientific hatred
I understand it now...
As the cyber war approaches
The human beings on extermination
Existence: reaches its end.

Hopeless; the tolerated levels of
Stupidity exceed their limits,
Nuclear war and chemical warfare
Self-destroy mechanisms in progress

BLASTED EARTH SURVIVAL,
BLASTED FUTURE FOR MANKIND
COLLIDING EXTINCTION
IT'S THE WORLD GENOCIDE BLAST!

The war is over now...
As the cyber war has ended
The human beings have been exterminated
Existence - dwells no more.

Insanity, corrupted the conscious minds
Artificial intelligence took over,
Supreme machines tore down the walls
Self-destroy mechanisms in success!

BLASTED EARTH SURVIVAL,
BLASTED FUTURE FOR MANKIND
COLLIDING EXTINCTION
IT'S THE WORLD GENOCIDE BLAST!
