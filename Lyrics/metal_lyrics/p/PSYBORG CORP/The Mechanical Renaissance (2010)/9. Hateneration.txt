[Extract from Oblivion: manifesto for the OVNI festival in Barcelona]
[Sample from Robert Oppenheimer interview on the atomic bomb]

Now I am become death
The destroyer of worlds
Again, get loosing deception
Another fraud on a time of descend
Remains, the path of damnation
Imposed by the nature of hate

We are the sons of machinery
Growing up among technology
We are the sons of a screen display
And we are the resulting experiment

WE // HATE // THE // BREED
DESTROY // THE // WEAK
DIVIDE // CONQUER
BRING // ON // THE // END

In the dead silence of the morning
At 5:29:45 Mountain War Time
The Jornada del Muerto was bathed
In an intense flash of light
That man had only seen from the stars.

Now, I am become Death
The destroyer of worlds.
We knew the world would not be the same.
A few people laughed,
A few people cried,
Most people were silent.
