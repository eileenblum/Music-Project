(Shut up and obey, obey or die...)

Take over, arise!
Dehumanized by the science dictator
Execute order!
Pacify, engineering society
Overtaking authority
Crystallized, system of security
No truth! No freedom!
Defrauded nations, decimated

Awake!!
Rebel masses revolt!
But losing ground...
Desperate slavery hails:
Rise! Rise!! Rise!!!

Strictly under control,
And holding ground
The Scientist Army commands:
Strike! Strike!! Strike!!!

Mega-corporations
Took control of our nations
Persecute, follow
Population: diminished is hollow!
Trusted computer systems...
Modified by the Technocratic Empire
Under surveillance
Microchip Wasted/Terminated

Awake!!
Rebel masses revolt!
But losing ground...
Desperate slavery hails:
Rise! Rise!! Rise!!!

Strictly under control,
And holding ground
The Scientist Army commands:
Attack! Attack!! Attack!!!

Destroy and reconfigure the human race
In order to reach
The next step of the human evolution
Improve environmental malfunctions to recreate
A utopic civilisation upon Earth
Prevent interference before those who oppose
Peace laws and treaties which lead our control

âWe, the people, pledge allegiance to the
Technocratic empire. May our nation prevail
In the name of technology. May our enemies
And traitors succumb to the rumbling sound
Of our holy machinery of scientific war,
For it is the art, the cause and the glory
Which will lead us to victory!â
