[Music: Krystian Przybylski &amp; Plethora, lyrics: Krystian Przybylski, Patrycja Sobczyk]

Toast, coffee and cigarette
That day I'd like to forget.
I'd like to change myself,
I'd like to be somebody else.
Every day is the same
Do we have an equal law?
Constant fight or stupid game,
Stop this! Open this door!

I have a choice,
I want to break free.
Extinguished cigarette
My only trace in this game,
I'll never be me.

Save me, love me or hate me...
Time is always running out.
Save me, love me or hate me...
Change something in our life.

Save me, love me or hate me...
Disappear from my life.
Save me, love me or hate me...
Forget about this time!

Toast, coffee and cigarette
Women run this world every day.
If I win, I'll be a diva,
Take a spot for me.
We need to decide,
I don't cry,
I have to lay down.
Can I go or stay inside?

I have a choice,
I want to break free.
Extinguished cigarette
My only trace in this game,
I'll never be me.

Save me, love me or hate me...
Time is always running out.
Save me, love me or hate me...
Change something in our life.

Save me, love me or hate me...
Disappear from my life.
Save me, love me or hate me...
Forget about this time.

Set me free and let me be alone..
Set me free and leave me!

[Solo]

Save me, love me or hate me...
Time is always running out.
Save me, love me or hate me...
Change something in our life.

Save me, love me or hate me...
Disappear from my life.
Save me, love me or hate me...
Forget about this time.
