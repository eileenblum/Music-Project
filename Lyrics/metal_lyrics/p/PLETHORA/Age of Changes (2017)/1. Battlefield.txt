[Music: Krystian Przybylski &amp; Plethora, lyrics: Krystian Przybylski, Patrycja Sobczyk]

Frantic mindless battalion
Searching unit one of black crowd
Hunting slaves of battlefield
Frenzy masters of brutality

That's my risk!
Everywhere dirty world war...
Choose something or let me go.

[Arabic vocal]

Cold case love around the ash,
Left this war outside alone.
Soldier and Arabic diva,
Temptation has come.

That's my risk!
Everywhere dirty world war...
Don't give up, freedom will come.

[Arabic vocal]

[Solo]
