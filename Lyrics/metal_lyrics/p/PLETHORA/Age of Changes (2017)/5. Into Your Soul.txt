[Music: Krystian Przybylski and Plethora, lyrics: Wojciech Surowiec]

Walking through the nowhere
Fighting with my thoughts
I don't understand
How you changed my world
What is going on?
My soul wants to fly
My heart beats again
My soul wants to fly

Into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying...

I've been looking for you
But you have found me
I have been alone
For ten thousand years
But I don't know how
My soul's gonna fly
Won't you tell me how
My soul's gonna fly

Into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying into your soul
Your soul
Your soul
Your soul...

[Solo]

Into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying into your soul
A rustle of...
Flying into your soul
Your soul!
