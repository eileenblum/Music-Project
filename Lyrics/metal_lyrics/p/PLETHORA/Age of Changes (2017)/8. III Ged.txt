[Music: Krystian Przybylski and Plethora, lyrics: Wojciech Surowiec]

You were my fear you were my pain,
But now I change the rules of game
You run â I'm coming after you

I am the hunter, you are prey
I am gonna get you anyway
How does it feel to be afraid?

Through ice and fire, wind and cold
Nothing'll stop me!
Across the sea and ancient world
Where fate has brought me

How come the Shadow knows my name
I don't recall mistake I've made
When we finally stand alone
However it ends (oh no!)

Let's finish what I have begun
The pursuit still goes on and on
The Lastland's far behind my boat

There is no sound there is no sea
At last the Shadow comes to me
It's always been my destiny

Through ice and fire, wind and cold
Nothing'll stop me!
Across the sea and ancient world
Where fate has brought me

How come the Shadow knows my name
I don't recall mistake I've made
When we finally stand alone
I swear, you won't eat my soul!

The Shadow speak

Darkness falls, you are mine
It's your endless torment
You will taste the pain

Feel my grip, suffocate
You will beg for a quick death
I will drink your blood

[Solo]

My father's face, the dragon's flames
The Shadow's changing
My last one spell, I'll say my name
The world is fading
Together now, spoken out loud
Our names are same
Light and the dark, merge into one
Who I've become
No one has lost, neither has won
But we are one
Shadow was me, part of my soul
I've let it go
I've traveled half, through out the world
And now I know
That it was me, I have run from
I'm coming... Home
