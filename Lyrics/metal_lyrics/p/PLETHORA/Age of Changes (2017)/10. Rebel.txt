[Music: Krystian Przybylski and Plethora, lyrics: Krystian Przybylski]

You have your destiny,
You choose who you are.
Look up effortlessly
Through the eyes of free man.

You are buried by all the crap
That is flying all around.
You are pitching ball out
Making safe home run.

Go! Go straight to your destiny.
Run! Run if you can't go.
Fly! Fly if you can't run.
Crawl! Crawl if you have no strength.

You broke mystified chains,
They only kept you down.
You found drilling disdain,
Fucking hypocrisy all around.

You better move on.
Don't stagger a bit
You've got wide open road
Go ahead with your wit.

Go! Go straight to your destiny.
Run! Run if you can't go.
Fly! Fly if you can't run.
Crawl! Crawl if you have no strength.

[Solo]

Go! Go straight to your destiny.
Run! Run if you can't go.
Fly! Fly if you can't run.
Crawl! Crawl if you have no strength.
