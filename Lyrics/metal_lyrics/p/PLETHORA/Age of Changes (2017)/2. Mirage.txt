[Music: Krystian Przybylski &amp; Plethora, lyrics: Krystian Przybylski]

Dissolved feelings like mirage
Between extreme.
Collage of bright and dark
Faded by the dust.

For any reason pretend it's fine,
Colored just by man's thoughts.
Their stark biased image
Becoming alive.

When endearing woman sneaking to man's mind.
When she controls his senses, then she feels like God.
This wild fascination is boiling one more plot,
They cannot resist it, it's high time for another round.

Distant oasis,
Promised land,
Dispatched riders of
Burning desire

Strong temptation curls around us
Gripping our minds.
When she rises above the clouds,
They seem to find way out.

When endearing woman sneaking to man's mind.
When she controls his senses, then she feels like God.
This wild fascination is boiling one more plot,
They cannot resist it, it's high time for another round.

[Solo]

When endearing woman sneaking to man's mind.
When she controls his senses, then she feels like God.
This wild fascination is boiling one more plot,
They cannot resist it, it's high time for another round.
