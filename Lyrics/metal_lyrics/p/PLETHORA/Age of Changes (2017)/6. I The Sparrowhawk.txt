[Music: Krystian Przybylski &amp; Plethora, lyrics: Wojciech Surowiec]

His mother gave him only name.
Grown wild and proud but with no love.
He wouldn't know
A wizard he'll become

O teach me witch the spells you know.
I also want to have control.
This world
Will never be the same again for me.

The Dragon Lord
Born on Isle of Gont.
The Sparrowhawk
His true name was unknown.
The Dragon Lord
Born of Isle of Gont
The Sparrowhawk!

Kargs attack the Gont,
Some have escaped,
But wizard stayed to make them pay.
Gather the fog
And shape the mist
Into the deadly wraiths.
Now Kargs are near,
But fog is thick
The battle-cry and the fights begins.
The blood had flown,
The sands were red,
Until the tide washed them away.

Mage powers had been overspent.
He's dying as no one can help.
Then stranger came
And took the pain away.

Ogion the Silent saved my life,
Now he's my master and my guide.
Naked and nameless
I was given my
True name.

The Dragon Lord
Born on Isle of Gont.
The Sparrowhawk
His true name was unknown.
The Dragon Lord
Born of Isle of Gont.
The Sparrowhawk!

I haven't learnt
Nothing at all.
Silence is not a way to know.
I have to prove
My power's strong.
I'm gonna make it on my own.
I'm gonna read
The charms and spells
To call the spirits of the dead.
Puzzling out the runes.
My eyes are fixed
I cannot move them even a bit!

Killer blast

Something's crouching towards me,
A shadow darker than the night.
It whispers and it's killing me,
It's all over suddenly.

[Solo]

I haven't learnt
Nothing at all.
Silence is not a way to know.
I have to prove
My power's strong.
I'm gonna make it on my own.
I'm gonna read
The charms and spells
To call the spirits of the dead.
Puzzling out the runes.
My eyes are fixed
I cannot move them even a bit!
