[Music: Krystian Przybylski and Plethora, lyrics: Patrycja Sobczyk]

How this darkness might affect me?
I don't understand it.
When deep dread is coming here
I cannot stand it.

Every memory is burning in fire
Let the fear goes up to the sky.
I just wanna know the answer,
Is there any choice in my life?

Life is in our hands!
You have to think what you really want.
Don't turn your back, don't turn your back!
Think what you've got, think what you've got!
Think what you've got, think what you've got!

Why this world is so full of pain?
I have to change it
Where is the love and my lost faith?
I want retrieve it

Every memory is burning in fire,
Let the fear goes up to the sky.
I just wanna know the answer,
Is there any choice in my life.

Life is in our hands!
You have to think what you really want.
Don't turn your back, don't turn your back!
Think what you've got, think what you've got!
Think what you've got, think what you've got!

[Vocal solo]

Life is in our hands!
You have to think what you really want.
Don't turn your back, don't turn your back!
Think what you've got, think what you've got!
Think what you've got, think what you've got!
