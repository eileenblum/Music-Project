[Music: Krystian Przybylski &amp; Plethora, lyrics: Patrycja Sobczyk]

Black walls and grey windows,
Cold bars are everywhere.
Nobody knows,
How can I get out of here?
Where is my past and future?
Where is my faith in people?
Where is the way to get out of here?

No regrets.
No regrets!

Have you thought about this before?
Have you ever tried more?
Feel indifferent, uncomfortable.
Let's do this! It's your freedom!

Black walls and grey windows,
Cold bars are everywhere,
I swear, I've never felt so bad as before.
Where is my guardian angel?
Why he forsaken me?
He heard what I had done.

No regrets.
No regrets!

Have you thought about this before?
Have you ever tried more?
Feel indifferent, uncomfortable.
Let's do this! It's your freedom!

[Solo]

No regrets.
No regrets!
I feel so independent.

Have you thought about this before?
Have you ever tried more?
Feel indifferent, uncomfortable.
Let's do this! It's your freedom!
