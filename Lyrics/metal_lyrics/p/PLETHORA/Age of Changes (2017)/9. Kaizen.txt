[Music: Krystian Przybylski and Plethora, lyrics: Wojciech Surowiec]

One! Problems always come and problems always go,
Think how to use them to make you strong.
Two! One question is never enough,
Go deeper and deeper to find what lies above.
Three! Don't be too proud, genius might be a fool.
Four! Just dream your dreams and make them come true.
Five! Everything around you ain't gonna be the same
Everything around you is what you can't blame

Fear nothing, fight for you.
Fear nothing, fight for "them".
Fear nothing, when you are knocked down!
Get up, get up, get up!	[10x]

We have one life, so no time for regrets.
A great fall needs a great man.
Remember who you are.

Six! Don't seek an average life that gives you safety â chase your dreams diligently
Seven! Rich aren't born rich â is money what you wanna reach?
Eight! Be clever â everything and nothing is given
Nine! All the mistakes are truly forgiven
Ten! Gifted with new day release your pure mind what you need you will find.

Fear nothing, fight for you.
Fear nothing, fight for "them".
Fear nothing, when you are knocked down!
Get up, get up, get up!
Get up, get up, get up!

We have one life, so no time for regrets.
A great fall needs a great man.
Remember who you are.
Remember who you are.

[Solo]

We have one life, so no time for regrets.
A great fall needs a great man.
Remember who you are.
Remember who you are.
