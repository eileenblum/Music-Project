âThe Sky was grey, the Loch was gray, and the silhouette of the creature was a very dark grey against the lighter background, a perfect setting.
There where three distinct humps, a long slender neck ending in a small head and the overall length appeared to me thirty feet approximately.
I could see no details of eyes, mouth... but the outline was all beautifully clear, it was sloping in a graceful line down to, and under the water.
The creature was quite stationary and often dipped its head into water, either feeding or amusing itself.â

A black and white photo of 1934 reveals
a weird monster that comes from the lake,
it seems like a dark swan.
It has long neck and scales on its skin,
You can imagine how strange it is.
The new star of Scotland, you know it, Nessie is its name!

Yes, we know it all now, we can't see it but now,

Fame and importance will take it higher,
don't believe in what they want you to see...
It's a story, it's a fake,
you're not blind anyway,
in this legend I still will believe.

A giant creature from prehistorical age is awake,
Waves are coming near the shore, itâs swimming down below, I feel its breath
But those shadow could be a boat or even a giant trout, Iâm curious to know
Suspicious, I donât believe in tales
and I wonât fall in trap because I donât live in a world of fantasy.
I just want reality!

Rit.
Fame and importance will take it higher,
Donât believe in what they want you to see
It's a story, it's a fake,
you're not blind anyway,
in this legend I still will believe.

I want to believe, I just want to believe.
I wanna jump in the lake!

Rit.
Fame and importance will take it higher,
Donât believe in what they want you to see
It's a story, it's a fake,
you're not blind anyway,
in this legend I still will believe.
