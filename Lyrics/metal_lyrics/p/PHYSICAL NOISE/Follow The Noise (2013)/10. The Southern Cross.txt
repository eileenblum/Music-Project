The Southern Cross knows my way, she's my guide.
Until I arrived like a butterfly in the battelfield.
I can see and I can feel the pain of my friends.
When the blood slides, the steel under the moonlight shines.

The demons are, they're coming to take me.
I cannot escape, the Hand of Doom is rising.
But when they'll come my anger will make them scatter.
My fury is your, my body is your, but not my soul!

âWhen my moment will come you will fall from your throne,
your blood will cover my sword, (it'll) flow down from your eyes.
The Moon will rise again, your soul will be mine!â

Fallin' down the hills the revenge comes and kills!
Like a mirror down the moon, the knife of death will loving you.
