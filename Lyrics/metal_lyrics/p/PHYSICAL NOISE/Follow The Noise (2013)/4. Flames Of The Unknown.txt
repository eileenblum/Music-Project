We wonder where we come from,
And what is our aim in this life
We evolved from monkeys to the intelligent men
Just to dominate the world
Industries first,
Then technologies,
We become great heroes
Nothing can stop us,
WE ARE THE BEST!
But who give us the power
to feel superior?

You better think that Mother Earth
Is a dangerous place
What has been created
Could also be destroyed

Show me the way you fight against the thunder,
You run away if you find yourself under,
Gather your forces and become much stronger,
Flames of the Unknown could hit you and let you...
Show me the way you fight against the thunder,
You run away if you find yourself under,
Gather your forces and become much stronger,
Flames of the Unknown could hit you and let you die!

And let you die!

This is the end of evolution,
The strong wins over the weak
We evolved from monkeys to powerful gods,
We feel the chosen ones
Atomic bombs than nuclear wars,
We become great killers
Nothing can stop us,
WE ARE THE BEST!
But who give us the power
to feel superior?

You better think that Mother Earth
Is a dangerous place
What has been created
Could also be destroyed

Show me the way you fight against the thunder,
You run away if you find yourself under,
Gather your forces and become much stronger,
Flames of the Unknown could hit you and let you die!

Show me the way you fight against the thunder,
You run away if you find yourself under,
Gather your forces and become much stronger,
Flames of the Unknown could hit you and let you...
Show me the way you fight against the thunder,
You run away if you find yourself under,
Gather your forces and become much stronger,
Flames of the Unknown could hit you and let you die!

And let you die!
