You're feeling great but it's all fake,
Sell your soul for Devil's sake,
Cracking your mind you are burning. BURNING!
Lost inside a purple maze,
a cage impossible to break,
in loneliness you are crawling. CRAWLING!
Inside the mirrored room, the demons threatening you,
dependence is now clear, you're crawling, forever!
The mark is set on you, there's no complex view,
You jump in this abyss, you're burning, you falling!
There's no God that you can pray,
the road is closed, can't hide away,
feeling the terror is growing. GROWING!
Lost inside a purple maze,
another soul, this is your blame,
in loneliness you are burning. BURNING!
Inside the mirrored room, the demons threatening you,
dependence is now clear, you're crawling, forever!
Your mind is get to loose because you start to abuse,
Your thoughts are thrown away, you're crawling, you falling!

Rit.
Down to a place where the sun don't shine,
there will be Eternal Night!
