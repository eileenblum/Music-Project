Here on this road
The rain falls upon me
I smile and I laugh
As long time ago
There's no scapegoats
And there's no mistakes
Unbalanced words
Now you say.

We draw the line
Not between us
But draw a line
That ties you to me

It's like a
Dream of a Fullmoon Night

A step in the darkness
Awake in my bed,
The hands search for your touch
Before I get mad
And I'm still searching
Through this neverending cold,
I search of the end of this
Darkest winter fall

Warm embraces,
My body's tied to you
An heating flame
Where all my dreams come true
Break the silence
With the noise of my breath
A thin line is drawn between
Dream and reality

It's like a
Dream of a Fullmoon Night

I cannot stay
Without touch your lips
And I cannot stay
Without feel your breath

It's like a
Dream of a Fullmoon Night
