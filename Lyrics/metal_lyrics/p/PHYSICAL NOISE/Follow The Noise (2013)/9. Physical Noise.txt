We will rock you tonight, we wanna take you far,
This smoke on the water is a shadow from the past.
I want to be elected, I'm gonna be a rock star.
Hear my song and hear my words from this Radio Ga Ga!

Music's mercenaries, from a different world,
We just rush in headlong, the ace of spades, our home.
Ride the fuckin' lightning, it's our childhood's end,
We are driven by you on this highway to hell!

The real sheep is you! Physical noise!
The real sheep is you!

Running wild and running free, ancient melodies,
Shout it out loud to the crowd, we've got to make you scream!
Anyway you want it, now you've got the best,
It's the dream of mirrors, we'll never lay to rest!

The real sheep is you! Physical noise!
The real sheep is you!
