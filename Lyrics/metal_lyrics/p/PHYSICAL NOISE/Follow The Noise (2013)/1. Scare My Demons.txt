And when the tears will fill your eyes, I'll dry your silver eyes,
'cos I' looking around hunting for a raindeer.
Oh little Sun you must born every day,
and die every single night.

And my spirit's crying for leaving,
when the moonlight is coming
and a breath of fire became fresh water snow.

I can dance in circle and she sings with me,
a lovely song between angels,
who are around the centre of the world.

The trees pour withe flowers,
spread twilight on my sunset,
and a breeze scare the demons in my mind.
If you are dreaming I assure you,
neither the wind can stop you,
a Spiral's sense sparks bright in my mind.

And my spirit's crying for leaving,
when the moonlight is coming
and a breath of fire became fresh water snow.

I can dance in circle and she sings with me,
a lovely song between angels,
who are around the centre of the world.
