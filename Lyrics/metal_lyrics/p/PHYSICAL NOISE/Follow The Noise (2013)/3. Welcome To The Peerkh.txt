Welcome to the Peerkh, rovers of pride and glory,
Which Arthes bless your way!
Adventures close at hand, don't let them run away,
Twin suns shine on your way!
Women, battles, beer! It's heaven down to earth!
No dream, it's all for real.
But first choose your path. Will you be good or bad?
Arthes versus Krane!

Your home it seems so far away,
and your world it seems like fade away.

Rit.
The world you know is gone!
The Peerkh will be your home!

Arthes'll lead your steps, beware of darkside's terror,
The tyranny of Krane,
Shining gold and evil spells are only thin illusions,
the skirmish starts again!

Your home it seems so far away,
and your world it seems like fade away.

Rit.
The world you know is gone!
The Peerkh will be your home!

Welcome to the Peerkh, join us and fight for freedom,
the evil will not win. - YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ME!
Arthes's at your side, today is born an hero,
you're just realized your dream.

Your home it seems so far away,
and your world it seems like fade away.

Rit.
The world you know is gone!
The Peerkh will be your home!
