I've lost my mind, I've lost my reputation,
inside of me there's a state of insurrection.
And were long years since my mind was twisted,
I made too many sacrifice and they kicked me in the ass.

And I've got time, time that I wasted,
it's my final stage, my ego drives me crazy,
You doesn't hear, so my years was wasted,
now I see my sacrifice and I'll kick you in the ass

But now it's time for me to take my revenge,
no one could expect it, 'cause they thought that I am...

Too good to be bad, too good to be bad,
but inside my head I want to kick your ass!

I'm an assassin, I killed my past.
And that bullet you can stick it in your ass!
I can't loose time to hear your innuendo,
everytime you look at me it's another victory.
And I rised, rised from the ashes,
another card I play from my deck.

And now it's time for me to take my revenge,
no one could expect it, 'cause they thought that I am...

Too good to be bad, too good to be bad,
but inside my head I want to kick your ass!

âHoly Diver, You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me.
Ride the tiger, You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean.
Gotta get away, get away.
Gotta get away, get away...â
[Holy Diver â Ronnie James Dio]

And now it's time for me to take my revenge,
no one could expect it, 'cause they thought that I am...

Too good to be bad, too good to be bad,
but inside my head I want to kick your ass!
