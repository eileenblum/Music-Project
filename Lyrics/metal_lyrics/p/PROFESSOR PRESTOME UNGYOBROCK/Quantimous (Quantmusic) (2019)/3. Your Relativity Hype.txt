Yo, so whats up?
Have you given up yet.?
If not, here's
Some more ideas...
Never surrender isn't worth
The popular hype it gets
I try to finish what I start
Yet, when faced with redundancy
And obvious outcomes
A wise choice is to start anew
Easier then you think
To Give up
There's many options
To do something-else
Maybe think less and just do
Never be a permanent slave
To someone else's goals.
See yours completed too
Their agreement to yours
Can just be a lie to gain
Your favor
Never die for a lost cause
You can learn to see pointlessness
Moral for the moment
Before it's all gone
A fad hype train
Fighters go out with a bang.
Looking for redemption
Time for blood money
Humans' aging is gross
Time is killing your goals
Your Relativity Hype
Only resigns in your mind.
Your Relativity to the stars
Oh Blind World.
Those who, ditch you
You don't need them
Just leave Stay passive.
Can adjust yourself.
Can't adjust them.
