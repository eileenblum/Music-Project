[Beginning Of Ending, Repeated Tasks and Annoying Talks]

Mmmm
Atarikine wahdahn
What do you expect
Not a dumpster for
Constant problems
You fools, listen to
More music, oh yeah
What do you expect
Expect Nada uh
People need to chill out
People fail, to chill out
Rather complain and scream
About shit that doesn't even matter
You fools, its better to just give up
Then complain and bitch all day
What do, you expect?
Expect Nada
People fail, to chill out
Rather complain and scream
About shit that doesn't even matter.
Your raging is unnecessary
Anger stops you from giving up
Drop it, what your sayings
Said already, move on and
Give up.
