Danced with me destiny
Twisted to higher ground
On this mountain I see
All the things that are around

I sense bloom and shatter
Hear rhyme and song
All those things don't matter
For you're the only one I long

My eyes are blinded 
For all but you
See me through 

When it's raining down
It won't bother me
For I have found
The one and only I can see

My eyes are blinded 
For all but you
See me through
My eyes are blinded 
For all but you
See me through
