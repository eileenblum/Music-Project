Fazed by dreams they might haunt through
The reassuring moats of shade
Until the siren tempted me too
Beyond these guarded gates I've wade

Over sea and over land
My eyes did expand
Into regions of air
Away from all care

I stood in the streams
Of heavens bright beams
Thawed in the light
And danced with my children in the night

I've touched the bottom of the sea 
And stolen Prana from the sky
Somewhere in between I'll be
Some days I drown some days I fly

Over sea and over land
My eyes did expand
Into regions of air
Away from all care

I stood in the streams
Of heavens bright beams
Thawed in the light
And danced on my songs
In a place that belongs
To the people, the music and the night
