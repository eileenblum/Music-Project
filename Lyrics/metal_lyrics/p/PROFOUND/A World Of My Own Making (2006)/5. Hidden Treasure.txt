Weeping willow
Oh flower in disguise
Your saddened leaves 
Me twig of sorrow

You stand where others would sink
In swamps without a name
Moods of sadness 
You are able to tame

Don't you feel the strength I see within you?
A little would be fine

Hidden treasure
Your beauty is beloved
No harm will overcome
This pleasure

You lighten the heavens for us
Your own hands blocking your sight
And wonder why darkness
Rules over light

Don't you feel the strength I see within you?
A little would be fine

Pigeon fly,
Return the twig the message we long for.
Mountains high,
We're almost there, a new world for you and I.

You're my super nova in life
But still you're hiding
Shining day and night
Like a priceless treasure
You can make me feel I can fly
And still you're hidden
Treasure, lighten my life
You're my fire
