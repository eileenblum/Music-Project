Please be kind
To my sorrow
Tame your light
Upon the hollow

Where can I justify my mind?
Where are the crippled of my kind?

Write me 
Songs in the sky
Comfort from above
Feed my deny
And give me shelter 
From the pain

Shining wise
On my shiver
And the rest I couldn't find

Glimmering eyes
Grey and silver
Reflecting colours of my mind

Write me 
Songs in the sky
Comfort from above
Feed my deny
And give me shelter 
From the pain
