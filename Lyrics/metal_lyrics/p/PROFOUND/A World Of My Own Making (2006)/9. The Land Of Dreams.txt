In her realm
I dwell
On senses that only drift there

Warming sun
Your noon is yet to come
In your light only I stare

Love, I'm crawling home
You're my fire
My angel of desire

In her reign
I gain
And still my shame to bare

Shining Star
So close, nearly bizarre
In stardust only I stare

Love, I'm crawling home
You're my fire
My angel of desire

West is sneaking upon you every day
And wants to steal your rays away
But I always see you shining

Clouds conspire they do
They've cursed this darkness upon you
Still I see you shine

Love, I'm crawling home
You're my fire
My angel of desire
