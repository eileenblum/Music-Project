Side by side you and I
We've come this far in life
Towards a time that was confined
Inside our little Paradise

You cannot hold me responsible
You cannot always responsible
I cannot hold myself responsible
I cannot always responsible

Take me to the place I am dreaming of
According to my believe awaits absolution
Meet me, somewhere, sometime in your consciousness
I confront you all. Does this paradise exist?

Alone I took my chance to realize 
A fantasy that takes me high in the sky
Misunderstood thanks to my open mind
About a paradise

Free me from the curse that is haunting me
I'm calling from a daydream. Means this more liberty?

Alone I took my chance to realize 
A fantasy that takes me high in the sky
Misunderstood thanks to my open mind
About my paradise

Listen, those who wait contemplate. 
Change their ways and face pain, 
Brought to life by mistake

Free me from clouds that hangs over me
Take me away from streams leading me.

Am I raised on this soil?
That rages spits and boils
Of confused and angry men
Defending stolen land

I refuse to sail on lies
In this icing Paradise
We're stumble through night
As long as liberty is white
