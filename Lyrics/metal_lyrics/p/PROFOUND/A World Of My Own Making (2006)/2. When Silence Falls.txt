Voices,
Won't guide me through this rain 
Reflecting noises
Aware of this inner lame

Heaven seems to shrink in beauty

When silence falls upon
My heart I long for you
Keeper of that force so strong 
Fragile and warm
In perfect fail we'll be

Shade me,
From afterburning clime
Altering altars
This madness isn't mine

Heaven seems to shrink in beauty

When silence falls upon
My heart I long for you
Keeper of that force so strong 
Fragile and warm
In perfect fail we'll be

Please guide me through this rain
And be aware of my inner lame
