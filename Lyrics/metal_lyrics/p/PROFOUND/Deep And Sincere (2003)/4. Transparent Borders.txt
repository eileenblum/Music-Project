Babylon
Do you hear the words I say
For I long
That you understand me some day

Windmills to fight
Until I see the light

Forgive me my love
For it crosses slightly
Transparent borders
And destroy the inner me

One eyed man
There is more than you can see
Understand
You can't see the depths of me

Windmills to fight
Until I reach the night

Forgive me my love
For it crosses slightly
Transparent borders
And destroy the inner me

Do you remember the rain
On the night you let me fall
Do you see my gain
That I have risen after all
With love and support
From bleeding hearted medicals
It is all the same
For in my curse I have forgiven all
