As I close my eyes
I sense a creeping fear
'cause my demons are searching for me
I won't try to hide
Knowing they will find
No one else can set me free

I flounder
Drown by memories
I flounder
Sore and shore less seas

Though I'm not afraid
I fear the sea
âcause of all its inner secrets
When I face it
Mirrors parts of me
I have to face my deepest scratches

I flounder
Drown by memories
I flounder
Sore and shoreless seas

The reason I'm alive
Lives inside a heart
For that love is morphine to me

I flounder
Drown by memories
I flounder
Sore and shoreless seas
