Never thought too much
About the light that makes the shadow
Darkness in my world
Have I missed the beauty I know?

Never felt too much
About desire before
While my hands can touch
They are fists no more

Light is an open eye
Horizons drift
Still notice the firefly
Cherish that gift

Always saw too much
Of my shoelaces and dirt
Silence in my world
Have I blurred the music I heard?

Never felt too much
About desire before
While my hands can touch
They are fists no more

Light is an open eye
Horizons drift
Still notice the firefly
Cherish that gift
