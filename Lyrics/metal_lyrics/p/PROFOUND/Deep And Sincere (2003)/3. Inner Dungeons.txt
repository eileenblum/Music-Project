When the angelâs song stops feeling right
And their presence becomes silent
You feel there is no place to hide
Protecting less then you from violence

Time bewitches the hourglass
And ices up your mind
All that moves resembles past
Reflections of the scars you wouldn't find

In that hour of dark
Between Jackel and Hyde
You can bury it deep
When that fear is your guide
Clear the dungeons in your mind
Though an agony ride
Leave your demons behind

A banners cry has toughed your sight
You try your best to focus
Temporarily cast out from light
While trying not to show it

Time bewitches the hourglass
And ices up your mind
All that moves resembles past
Reflections of the scars you wouldn't find

In that hour of dark
Between Jackel and Hyde
You can bury it deep
When that fear is your guide
Clear the dungeons in your mind
Though an agony ride
Leave your demons behind

Depths ahead of you
Shadows behind whom
Torturing your present
Violate your essence
Step beyond the edge release

In that hour of dark
Between Jackel and Hyde
You can bury it deep
When that fear is your guide
Clear the dungeons in your mind
Though an agony ride
Leave your demons behind

A voice connects your secret place
You recognize the timber
And need to fight the fear to gaze
In shadow land and meet her

Time bewitches the hourglass
And ices up your mind
All that moves resembles past
Reflections of the scars you wouldn't find

In that hour of dark
Between Jackel and Hyde
You can bury it deep
When that fear is your guide
Clear the dungeons in your mind
Though an agony ride
Leave your demons behind
