In my dark the blackness was so thick
It helped to find my way
Like a light that shines so bright
It forces you to stay

Guided by the ghost of despair

My house I've burned
I've wandered and I've roamed

Loneliness was like a teacher
For a crippled soul like mine
Silence was a tender polish
That made inner dungeons shine

Guided by the ghost of despair

My house I've burned
I've wandered and I've roamed
âtill I have turned
The ashes into home

With all the fear for the damage
Below the surface I
Uncorked the poison bottle
Drank it âtill the last drop
In each swallow I have died

Aided by unconditional
Love, I headed for
My battleground, I fought
And conquered all the places
Where inner rest was found

My house I've burned
I've wandered and I've roamed
âtill I have turned
The ashes into home
