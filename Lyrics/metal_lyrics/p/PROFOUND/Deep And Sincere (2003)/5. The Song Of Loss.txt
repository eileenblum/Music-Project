Came to me
In your final hour
I tasted fear
For eternal power

I sense
Itâs all right for you
Although
I donât know who

You are
Why you wished to visit
Me, in my shelter
Looking for whatâs not mine to give

Tell me more spirit in pain
Mystery on its way
Is your body slain
Thank you for your final say
