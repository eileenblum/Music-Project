It was like a ravenous wave
Eruption of decay
Infection of our souls

Wind soundâs like
A breathe among hypnotic silence
Unnatural evolution of men startâs now

He has live among us
Spreading his plague

Itâs a chant of the universe
Uncontrolled, bestial rage of Thanatos
His wrath will torn out the earth
Eternal sun will fade
Our race will fall

Enslaved by a voice of the mystic being, 
lost in a lunatic dreams
We fear not

Standing on ashes of our past
Dancing on ancestorâs graves
We fear not

We still dreaming

Under the bleeding sky
We will wait for return of light
Living like a slaves
We will serve to the divine might

Hymn Of thousand wings
Brought Rain of the pestilence
We are pandemy
The children of the fire 

The children of the fire
