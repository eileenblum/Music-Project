Invocations tears out
the gates of world
Constellations loosing 
his primal force

Ancient structures have transformed 
in the new form
Strength becomes a weakness
Imprisoned race drown in lies
of his own minds
Hate becomes a sickness

Walking through 
a cold mist of penumbra
I had a dream
that my time is finally come

Pulsing rhythm of awakening rises my anger
Flames startâs to grow higher
Strong vibrations of ether reveals a truth
Dawn of a lunar cycle â Rise of the Fire God

War has coming
Brought new order
In the name of
Your true father

Your God
