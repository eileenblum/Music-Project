Go forth, pray to the stars
Soon all my secrets will be revealed
Don't stop, watch through my eyes
Soon a mystic wisdom will be unleashed

I am a future and a past
A messenger of chaos
Tormented by the endless dream

I am the darkness and the light
A genocidal messiah
Incarnation of all your fears

Rise up and shed your blood
A liquid fire hidden in a flesh
Wake up, kill your own God
Touch a spectral spheres
Touch if you dare

A symbols gather on the sky
Burning like a grotesque torches
Uroboros devours its tail

The whisper of the storm
Calls a deadly force of nature
Whole world will drown in agony
To be reborn

Through Deadspeak - I called you
Through Deadspeak - I found you 
Through Deadspeak - I taught you
Through Deadspeak - I walked with you

Through Deadspeak - I mark you
Through Deadspeak - I bound you
Through Deadspeak - I curse you
Through Deadspeak - I live in you
