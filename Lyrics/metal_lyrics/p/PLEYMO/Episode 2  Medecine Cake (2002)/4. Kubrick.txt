[Refrain:]
Take your time, your time your time your time
Everybody know you'll never be like this
Don't be worried worried worried worried
Everybody know you'll never be like this

It's my tribute to a master of his art
I think he was the one
There's no many of his kind
Danger pictures darkside pictures
Bad behaviors and a vision of the future

Hands up hands up for Stanley
Hands up hands up for Kubrick
Hands up hands up for Stanley
Hands up hands up for Kubrick

Clockwork orange, Alex devil's eyes 
Horns and halos, nocturnal flies
Surrounded by voyeurs and crack smoking lawyers
Nasty ah ah Stanley fueled by the drama
And he will never be erased of the memories
His virtuosity launches me
He will always stay in my mind territory
Nasty ah ah Stanley bring it out the drama

[Refrain]

Eyes wide shot

How many guys copy ideas of his work
Psycho movies, palsy, ballsy
He'll stay on my mind for a long time
Crazy ah ah Stanley fueled by drama

[Refrain]

Hands up hands up for Stanley
Hands up hands up for Kubrick
Hands up hands up for Stanley
Hands up hands up for Kubrick
Hands up put your hands up [x4]
