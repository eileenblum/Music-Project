Evidence points the failure in three different directions.
It makes it's pass as my eyes fold from the rejection.
It's decided and you have suffered for far too long.
Again and again you believed, you believed that I was wrong.
You are parched of the truth.
But drown in the water of the truth, the truth that you abused.

It was one January morning that you realized.
You lost everything and everything lost its place today.
Nothing ever stays the same.
Memories even change.
Casting distorted images of my face.

After all.
After all our backs are to the wall.
Sweet surrender.

If you stared long enough this picture would begin to clear.
Beyond the blur is the truth that, that you can not seem to bare
Sixteen acts of desperation in parallel to each other.
A beautiful warmth within this absence you have discovered.

It was one January morning that you realized.
You lost everything and everything lost its place today.
Nothing ever stays the same.
Memories even change.
Casting distorted images of my face.

After all.
After all our backs are to the wall.
Sweet surrender.

I remember warmth through sunrise.
And feeling alive through you.
Speaking a wish now from eyes to sky.
To remove sight and rely on touch tonight.
This one last time from eyes to sky...
And we never realized.
We chase dreams that are in front of our eyes.

After all.
After all our backs are to the wall.
Sweet surrender
