On June 5th mother gave her son a glass kiss that shattered in the distance.
And in that moment was the only innocence that he had ever witnessed.
He has his fathers eyes.
Like the emotions that followed we watched.
And as the spirit is hollowed were taught.
A single word was left alone.
A single kiss destroyed us all.

Distance yourself before less becomes more.
Detach from family because your hearts torn.
I was certain I could mend these wounds.
And you certainly destroyed my views.
In his parents heart is home.
In this empty house, this empty heart is alone.
(with one word, we could have)

I can not erase this side of me.
For years it seemed like a dream.
There is nothing left for me here.
Now that I erased this side of you.
Here is the truth that you never knew.
There is nothing left for you here.

Images imprinted for angels to hold.
In his parents heart is home.
But this fragile soul begins to wear thin.
He has his mothers eyes. he wishes she was here.
This his 26th June 5th, he sits in silence.
4am and he screams again, but no one listens.

The sounds thats made when this heart will break.
A thousand and one smiles but all of them fake.
Crossed out all of the lies...
They stitched shut your honest eyes.
A last reply and you plea...
The whisper remains and her voice is still echoing.
(with one word, we could have)

I can not erase this side of me.
For years it seemed like a dream.
There is nothing left for me here.
Now that I erased this side of you.
Here is the truth that you never knew.
There is nothing left for you.

How far can we take this?
For years it seemed like a dream.
And I will not erase this side of you.
How far can we take this?
For years it seemed like a dream.
And I can not erase this side of me.

And it shines behind him.
Will he find what he's looking for?

I can not erase this side of me.
For years it seemed like a dream.
There is nothing left for me here.
Now that I erased this side of you.
Here is the truth that you never knew.
There is nothing left for you
