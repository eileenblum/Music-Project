I have collided with the very best of them.
Queens conquering kings bringing this all to an end.
This is nothing, this is nothing more then certainty.
And I am certainly holding on to dreams.
And I am waiting for the king.
Or is the king waiting for me?

Say it's OK but it certainly.
Has a certainty and I'm waiting for the king.
Say it's OK but it certainly.
Has a certainty or is the king waiting for me?

You bare the burden of this ring that you wear.
Its weight, a thousand lies.
Do tell, what you kept inside.
I dreamt of us burning bridges.
Lets leave the bridge burning and build our new dreams.
There's nothing left for us to see.
And I am waiting for the king.
Or is the king waiting for me?

Say it's OK but it certainly.
Has a certainty and I'm waiting for the king.
Say it's OK but it certainly.
Has a certainty or is the king waiting for me?

Say it's OK.
Maybe you get it?
This is something you can't miss.
Just close your eyes and remain motionless.
And I'm sorry that I always let you down.
Dethrone the king and remove his crown.

The city's burning it is certain.
Find the king.
He emerges alive and screaming to me.
"I've lost everything."
"god please bring back the queen."
And when I say "it's too late, no she can't be saved."
He said "weren't you always looking for me?"
"where were you when this fire took everything?"
I'm so sorry...
It seems as if the king was always waiting for me
