And I would surrender the last empire tonight.
This has gone far enough to remove these walls that stand for you.

To never return here again.
(for once we are alive)
The fire in the sky...
To never return here with you.
(just once you are mine)
Will lead us tonight.
This is where we've always belonged.
A place we thought we'd lost for so long.

Set the fire the flame has gone.
Saddest eyes, the lies I shunned.
It's on fire the flame has won.
And in time you will see what you've done.

Now decide if this miracle is yours or mine.
And with out haste the biggest mistake I ever made...
Was clearly surrendering my heart today.

To never return here again.
(for once we are alive)
The fire in the sky...
To never return here with you.
(just once you are mine)
Will lead us tonight.
This is where we've always belonged.
A place we thought we'd lost for so long.
Why do I hang on every word you say?

Set the fire the flame has gone.
Saddest eyes, the lies I shunned.
It's on fire the flame has won.
And in time you will see what you've done.

Why do I hang on every word you say?
This empire was built to remain.
This prophecy that you showed me.
These lies on lies that you told me.
You crucified us...
Why do I hang on every word you say?

Set the fire the flame has gone.
Saddest eyes, the lies I shunned.
It's on fire the flame has won.
And in time you will see what you've done.

As vast as the oceans.
As blue as the sky's.
Your love reflected into my eyes
