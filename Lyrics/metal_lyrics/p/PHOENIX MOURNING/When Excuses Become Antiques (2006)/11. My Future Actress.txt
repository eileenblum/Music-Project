I am washing my hands of you.
Hand prints on my heart still bleeding through.
A momentary chance for reasoning...
And in the morning she'll be leaving.
This is one fight I can not win.

She is delicate when she smiles at you and you hate it.
Let it go unnoticed, a perfect reflection.
He wants what she wants...
I had seen it in a movie once.
A Hollywood romance and I let it go unnoticed.

It's been a long night and I'm not looking forward to this drive.
It's been a long night and I'm not looking forward to saying goodbye.

She took the stage on opening night.
It was so beautiful how she moved through the room.
Maybe it was the light...
Or maybe I was consumed.
As I made my way through.
To the front to see...
My future actress in action, acting for me.

These are the confessions of a photograph.
The ones I said that I had burned.
And the ones that you said you took back.
Unnoticed, a perfect reflection.
I am many miles away from everything.
In hopes of never returning.
When you see what I see.
You will notice... a perfect reflection.

It's been a long night and I'm not looking forward to this drive.
It's been a long night and I'm not looking forward to saying goodbye.

A romance ending gracefully as goodbyes settle the night.
Pictures we paint stained canvases we hate.
One last goodbye and I promise ill never be the same.
Pictures we paint stained canvases we hate.
One last goodbye but I wish you would stay.

It's been a long night and I'm not looking forward to this drive.
It's been a long night and I'm not looking forward to saying goodbye
