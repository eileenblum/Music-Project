You are everything everyone wanted you to be.
Now it's time for closure.
So I hand you your own eyes back so you can see.
That a whore is priceless in a mind that we erased.
Peel back new skin.
You can still save face.

In vain I will lead you to this blade and show you the way.
But in my heart and with this love...
I refuse to let you die today.
Lay us to rest in your red river.
You will drown in shame.
You can not see that you are the water not the victim.
It is victims that you claim.

Hold on wait for the moment.
Capture it and never let it go.
A last chance for understanding.
But I will not let it show.
I held on and waited for.
What was never mine, and never yours.

I brought flowers to decorate your funeral.
But they just died alone with me in the car.
And I never made it out alive my love.
This blade etched with our names has created two scars.

Spread our wings and through heavens we fly.
We are forever our love will never die.
We were once divided.
But now we see as one again.
Your restless soul will not sleep.
Until it's released of memories of me.

Hold on wait for the moment.
Capture it and never let it go.
A last chance for understanding.
But I will not let it show.
I held on and waited for.
What was never mine, and never yours.

As we aspired to be more.
Your love remained a revolving door.
And as we proceeded, I gave you all you needed.
But in your eyes the sky was falling.
This door no longer revolving.
A last chance for understanding.
Hand to hand we wrote this ending.

In vain, you can.
Faceless love.
With mask's that we wear proudly.
Removing them to see what we want to see.
We are comforted by small talk and sweet kisses.
Isn't love bliss?

Hold on wait for the moment.
Capture it and never let it go.
A last chance for understanding.
But I will not let it show.
Hold and wait for the moment
