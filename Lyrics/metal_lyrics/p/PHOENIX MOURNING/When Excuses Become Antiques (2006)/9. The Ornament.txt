Blood thins like water.
This tragedy has no order.
Pray that what remains can redeem me again.
Why have I spread myself this thin?
My god all I ever wanted is answers.

Can't you see I am over.
Can't you see I'm over this?
(this hour glass goes on for days)

Say this for a new report.
As spoken in silent death threats.
Say this or with regret.
Decorate the ornaments place.

A wounded angel has taught me to fly.
My broken wings will never reach the sky.
This is the curse that has now been laid upon me.
As heavens stare down on another tragedy.

Can't you see I am over.
Can't you see I'm over this?
(this hour glass goes on for days)

Say this for a new report.
As spoken in silent death threats.
Say this or with regret.
Decorate the ornaments place.

Through glass eyes...
Are shattered reflections.
Through glass eyes...
Reflect your true intentions.

Will the sun rise above the horizon.
Will tomorrow bring a new light in?

Say this for a new report.
As spoken in silent death threats.
Say this or with regret.
Decorate the ornaments place.

Through these glass eyes...
Are true intentions
