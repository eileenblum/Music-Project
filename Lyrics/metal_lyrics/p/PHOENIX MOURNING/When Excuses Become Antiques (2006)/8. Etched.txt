The beating is of my heart alive again.
Faint sound so frightening, yet so compelling.
Eyes collided, two hearts decided.
This isn't the end it has only started.
Two hearts can beat as one, one beat is not enough.
A line was drawn to never be crossed.
Her cardiac arrest is both of our lives lost.
I etched forever in your eyes.
But forever will always end in time.

A bitter collapse to my knees.
With this bitter kiss.
This shame now feeds sympathy.
Accept your words were severed.
Tears soaked into each page.
You will unwrite this novel.
There are many memories to erase.
I etched forever in your eyes.
But forever will always end in time.

You hear these two hearts they beat as one.
Again I faltered in the end.
You hear these two hearts they beat as one.
Again alone is where I stand.
(forever in your eyes)

Is this the way that she sees me?
A new disease with no remedy.
Is this the way?

On your watch a death has occurred.
The death of you and me.
This love no longer has a pulse.

I etched forever in her eyes.
She asked if I loved her and I replied.

You hear these two hearts they beat as one.
Again I faltered in the end.
You hear these two hearts they beat as one.
Again alone is where I stand.
(forever in your eyes)

If you only didn't let these words fall short of your heart.
I never let these words fall short of my heart.
If I only...
