A vision through a moonstill water
The story of a long lost child
Inside this gruesome blackness
This massive hole of emptiness

From the ever he could touch the sky
Yet as he tried to climb
The walls crumbled to dust
And inside, the boy appeared

I watched him grow, I saw his eyes
As he turned away in cries
How it hurts
And the tears taste like blood

From the ever he could touch the sky
Yet as he tried to climb the walls
They crumbled into dust

I ran away from life
Through those walls that imprisoned me
Within myself, inside my pain and misery

As the preludium silenced
I wiped away my crystallized tears
I wiped them all away
