Light is dim
In fact, it is naught
Spring went into summer
Yet summer stepped aside
As autumn took its place
Then autumn died
And winter came to stay...

Beyond the waste remains
Of autumns decayed suit
Neither heat nor frost
Maketh any difference

Silent solitude
Winter's reign
That which once was
And perhaps once more
To be ...sleeps

In the land where dreams are reality
And reality is no more to be
If thou from 'ere canst see
Solitaire reality
Winter thy cryb and thus
Thine crypt...

...And by spring's soft embrace you will awake
From winter's peaceful sleep...
