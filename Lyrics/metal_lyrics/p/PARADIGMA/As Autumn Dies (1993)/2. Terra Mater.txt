Spring ... Writhe
Autumn ... Rise
Twilight ... Begin
Decay ... Thus bring

Disharmony their son
The blackening of the sun
Betrayal begun
Disoriented creed, all past begone

Darkness can't hide them
From our moonlight gone black

It's born again
The beginning of the end
Our forces must blend
Our lives to expend

Disharmony has won
The blackening of our sun
Cleaning operation has begun
Disoriented creed is soon gone

Cold winds ... Rise
Past life ... Writhe
Parasites ... Die
Terra Mater ... Lives
