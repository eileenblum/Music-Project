As I lie here, knowing I will
(Never) Get away from here
(Alive) Through death...
No one can do anything but to wait
As I slowly wither from within

Soon I won't be able to move
(Will I see the land)
Soon I won't be able to speak
(Where my ancestors sleep)
Soon I won't be able to think clearly
(Will I ever journey home)

Dying faster, thinking of all things unaccomplished
Ideas only I could ever carry through
All my dreams discarded before my time is due

I will float into the ever
If there is an ever
I will only know for sure
When it is too late for me to tell you

So I'll just give you my best regards
