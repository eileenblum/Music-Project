Come winter, cold and frosty
Hold me firmly in your vice
With majestic force you hold
This world in your white hand

Come winter, white preserver
Cover my body with white lace

Come winter, pure and shining
I pleed thee for eternal existence
You have the might to preserve
Life in its slumber

Come winter, white preserver
Please heed this my last wish
On earth

Trustful friend;
Never deceive
Enshroud me;
Peace surrounds my soul

Misty grace;
Cover me in white
Forgive my sins;
Winter, keep me warm
