It's wonderful; Darkness is my bride
This shrine overwhelms me
As I become one with my own fate

Through the inverted land I journey
Where the seas of joy fall
From the eclipse of blackness

Some soothing darkness crawls up my spine
This truth overwhelms me
The heart of my soul unveiled
Such perfection
Mortals seldom do encounter
The end, some sort of beginning

...My journey is at an end...

The key to happiness
The hope of beyond
Is but a delusion

...I go...
...Far away to seek
...My coming, the truth
...Which lies far beyond my dreams
...It is the ever and ever for me

It is an illusion, lest the power is
Twisted it seems, as twilight ascends
Welcome then its dim embrace

To begin To cease To stray
To wander To live To be
Eradicated

Unslaved...
