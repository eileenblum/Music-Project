You call me the sinner
but I've seen with my own eyes,
hatred and corruption
deep within your church of lies.

Masters of deception
slaves to decadence and lust,
Poisoning the masses
violating sacred trust.

[Chorus:]
Open your eyes
tell me what you see.
How can you say
that you still believe.

Architects of madness
hide behind their grand facade.
Children of creation
taught to fear the wrath of god.

So get down on your knees
fold your hands and bow your head.
You may choose to follow
but I will not be mislead.

[Repeat chorus]
