Shadows fall...
under blood red skies,
as the angels mourn their dying son.

One for all...
crimson tears he cries,
for he knows the end has just begun.

[Chorus:]
the love he had has died...
condemned and crucified.
All the pain he tried to hide...
burns inside.

Blood will flow...
from the hearts of men,
for the one who wears the martyrs crown.

Now they know...
he will rise again,
though they tried in vain to strike him down.

[Chorus:]
The love we had has died...
condemned and crucified.
al the pain we tried to hide...
burns inside.

I gaze into your eyes...
I see that we are one.
Your hand in mine we walk alone...
until our days are done.
