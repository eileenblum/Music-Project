Father of creation
now bows his head in shame.
Paradise is burning
and we're the ones to blame.

The end is fast approaching,
apocalypse is here.
The sun no longer rises
as judgment day draws near.

[Chorus:]
I gave you sanctity,
you brought down fire and wrath.
I gave you purity,
you chose the serpents path.

Politicians scheming
to get out while they still can.
Safe behind their castle walls,
they watch the fall of man.

[Repeat chorus]

Sifting through the ruins
a child cries alone.
They're the ones who suffer
it's we who must atone.

[Repeat chorus]
