I am legion
sacred whore.
I'm the heathen angel you adore.

Feel the fire
let it burn.
Past the point of no return.

[Chorus:]
No release from this agony
god above have you forsaken me.
Drowning in my misery
holy father won't you set me free.

set me free.

I'm the evil
you despise.
The demonic sorcerer of lies.

This inferno
my domain
the addiction driving you insane.

[Repeat chorus]

[Bridge:]
set me free
desperations final plea
set me free
as I am soon you shall be.
