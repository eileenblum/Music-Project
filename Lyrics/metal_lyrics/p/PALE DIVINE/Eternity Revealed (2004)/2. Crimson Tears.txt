Take my hand and walk with me
beyond this masquerade.
I offer you a chance to dwell
where seas of red cascade.

[Chorus:]
wretched hands grasp the soul.
poison laughter centuries old.
crimson tears fall from your eyes
as your spirit slowly dies

I will follow where you lead
my soul is yours to take.
But promise me you'll still be near
perchance I shall awake.

[Repeat chorus]

Come closer my child,
let me gaze upon your light.
Your eyes are filled with innocence
though still concealed by night.

[Repeat chorus]
