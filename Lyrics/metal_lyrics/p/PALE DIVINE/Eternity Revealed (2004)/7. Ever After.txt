Driven by the fear
of our own damnation.
By the hope within us all
we are searching for salvation.

Complacency...
the righteous way to pacify temptation.
Yet in their eyes
I see the signs of anger and frustration.

Living in this desperate world
we struggle with confusion.
To think that we are without sin
is only an illusion.
