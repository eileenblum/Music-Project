Blackened is this heart of mine,
pain is all I feel.
Death can be a stae of mind,
wounds that never heal.

just a painful memory
forcing me to see.
All the pain and misery
that lives inside of me.

[Chorus:]
lord of sorrow
hollow be my name.
stained glass savior
thy kingdom never came.

All the colors in my mind
have slowly turned to gray.
Search for answers I can't find
drifting day to day.

Broken window to a dream
searching endlessly.
Drowning in a lake of tears
wash away my fears.

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat first verse]
