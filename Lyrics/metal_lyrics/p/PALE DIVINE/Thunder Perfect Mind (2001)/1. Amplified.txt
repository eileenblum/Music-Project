[I.]
Can you feel the power amplify?
As we travel through the silver sky,
A magic carpet ride for you and me,
We'll see what lies beyond eternity.

[Chorus:]
Can you feel it, can you feel it...
Can you feel the power amplify?

Mirror, mirror tell me what you see.
You're just a shadow of what used to be.
Ask the freaks, you know they never lie.
Release your mind and let your spirit fly.

[Repeat chorus]

The son of Satan says he knows your name.
No invitation but he's glad you came.
See the demons dance around the sun,
The battle for the earth has just begun.

[Repeat chorus]

Now the end is here, our journey's done.
The battle for the earth has just been won.
It's wise to envy not a sinner's fame,
And cheat the devil out of his own game.

[Repeat chorus]

[II.]
Orange blossom, bittersweet.
Purple clouds beneath my feet.
Inside my electric dream,
Things are never what they seem.

[Chorus II:]
Over, under, in between.
Cosmic journey, so serene.
Psychedelic shades of green.
Climb aboard the dream machine.

Ecstasy, wash over me.
Feel the sweet tranquility.
In my own mind, I know the way.
This is where I want to stay.

Wizard waves his magic wand,
Takes me to a world beyond.
Never thought I'd see the day
All my cares would fade away.

[Repeat chorus II]
