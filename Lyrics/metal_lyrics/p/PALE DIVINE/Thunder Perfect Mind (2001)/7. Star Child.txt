Hands reach to the heavens.
Eyes look to the sky.
Beyond this blue horizon,
Spread your wings and fly.

The power lies within you.
Seek and ye shall find.
Let the spirit guide you.
Thunder perfect mind.

[Chorus:]
You can chase the starlight,
Ride the astral trail.
You can climb the heavens.
Seas of light we sail.

Were you told to follow,
Or to light the way?
Deliver us from darkness,
Children of today.
