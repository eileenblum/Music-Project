Listen people, I'll tell you all,
The high and mighty are gonna fall.
Lust for power, hate and greed.
The more they have the more they need.

Betrayal hides behind a grin.
Turn your back, the knife goes in.
The lord has seen your wicked ways.
And now you bastards are gonna pay.

Little minds play little games,
And they expect you to do the same.
A twisted game that no one wins.
The Judas wheel forever spins.

Listen people, hear what I say.
I'm trying to tell you it's the only way.
You have to keep your love alive,
Or else this world just won't survive.
