Gather around the fire as the spectacle begins.
Flames are growing higher, soon she'll beg for all her sins.
Begging him for mercy as she's crying out in pain,
"None of us are witches, can't you see this is insane."

[Chorus:]
Oh, she wears the mark...
She wears the devil's mark.

"Silence wretched whore, there is no truth to what you say."
"You made love to Satan and for that you have to pay."
The smell of burning flesh begins to permeate the air.
Her life will soon be over, no one even cares.

The congregation will be gathered soon.
Hooded figures beneath and orange moon.
High preistess invokes the fallen one.
The dark avenger, unholy bastard son.
On the altar, the sacrifice is made,
Another life is lost beneath the silver blade.
Born of fire, in fire you shall fall.
By her wretched hand a curse upon you all...
