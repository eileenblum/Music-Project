Welcome to where time and space collide.
Over morphic fields of light we glide.
A journey of discovery my friend.
We'll race toward the golden rainbow's end.

[Chorus:]
Come inside, have a taste.
Only one, there's none to waste.
Sit down relax...feel the vibe.
Let time elapse as years roll by.

Can you feel the magic all around?
Another way to fly is what we found.
We paid the wizard more than twice his due.
To bring the magic potion home to you.

[Repeat chorus]
