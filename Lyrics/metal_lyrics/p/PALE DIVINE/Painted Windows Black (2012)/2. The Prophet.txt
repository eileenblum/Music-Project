In my dreams, I've seen visions so profound
Images revealed to me

All is lost, may their souls now rest in peace
Never will they rise again

The madness grows and swallows me as I begin to see
What was meant to be my destiny?

Sanctity, is it only in my mind?
Or will it be reality?

Prophecy, has the future been foretold?
Or is it just insanity?

Warning signs are all around
No mercy for the blind
Innocence cries out in pain
What chaos will tomorrow find?

No future for the world we know
The reaper comes to claim his own
The end is here we canât ignore
So shut your eyes and cry no more
