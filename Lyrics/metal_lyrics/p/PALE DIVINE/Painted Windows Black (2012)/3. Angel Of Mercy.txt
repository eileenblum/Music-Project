Donât tell me Iâm dreaming
I know this is real
No sense in denying the way that I feel

Angel of mercy
Vision in white
She holds the key to eternal light

So long I have wandered alone every day
Waiting for someone to show me the way

Angel of mercy
Vision in white
She holds the key to eternal light

â¦and then without warning came pain and despair
Awakened to find that she was never there

Searching for something that Iâll never find
This angel of mercy was all in my mind

Angel of mercy
Vision in white
She holds the key to eternal light

Cursed by desire
Bewitched by its spell
Reaching for heaven to save me from hell
