Nothing more than what you see
Is just as it appears still the other half was waiting
Silent, all these years

I tried to close my eyes
I tired to wish it all away
Knowing all the while there soon would come a day

Now the time has come
I wonât stay silent anymore
Now the other half will be the man I was before

I closed the inner sanctum of a tortured mind
Painted all of the windows black and left the world behind
