Show me the places forgotten by time
The dark empty spaces deep inside my mind

There once was a purpose, a grasp of the real
Now all that is left, is the coldness I feel

Did I leave the world behind?
Or was I abandoned?
Searching for truth but I end up empty handed

Iâve waited forever, now take me away
The seventh day of never, the time is today

The nightmare is over, the dream has begun
A new day is dawning, I rise with the sun

Did I leave the world behind?
Or was I abandoned?
Searching for truth but I end up empty handed
