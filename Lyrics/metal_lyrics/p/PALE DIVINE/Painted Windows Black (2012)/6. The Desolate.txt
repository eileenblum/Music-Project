Surrounded by walls, confining me
This desolation mocks my final plea

Another scar I feel the pain
Canât find the strength to face the strain
I set my course, no turning back
Damnation turns my world to black

So withdrawn, my mind is numb
I watch it all become undone

A growing fear, my own disgrace
A drowning mind in a dark embrace
The silence deafening my ears
It wields the shackles that Iâve worn for years

No god above, no hell below
This is the only world I know
The path I chose has lead me here
And now the time has come to face my fear

Iâve served my time, Iâve served it well
Now Iâm nothing, but an empty shell

I canât forgive, I wonât forget
Iâll turn my back with no regret
All I had is what I gave
An empty soul, a shallow grave

No god above, no hell below
This is the only world I know
The path I chose has lead me here
And now the time has come to face my fear

There is no hope for tomorrow
Iâm longing for my dying day
I will not wander in sorrow
Death is just a breath away
