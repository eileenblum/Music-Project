One by one the servants of the night convene in secrecy
It has begun black magic ritual obscene, a blasphemy

Thirteen minds aligned
Have gathered once again, so it begins
Upon this hallowed night
Their souls will be condemned for all their sins

I can see demonic shadows in the night
A dreadful night

Haunting me like specters in the pale moon light
Unearthly bright

Thirteen minds aligned
Have gathered once again, so it begins
Upon this hallowed night
Their souls will be condemned for all their sins

Baptized by the devils rain
Their wicked minds must be insane
They bow their heads as if to pray
Their master speaks and they obey
Lord of this infernal world
Reveals himself as was foretold
Tortured by demonic cries
The end unfolds before my eyes

Thirteen minds aligned
Have gathered once again, so it begins
Upon this hallowed night
Their souls will be condemned for all their sins
