From the dark - into the light
Eyes of fire burning bright.
Deliver us mortal men,
Your time has come to rise again.

He's on the outside looking in.
Dark angel in a dead man's skin.

[Chorus:]
I see the road that lies ahead.
Beyond the garden of the dead.
A journey to the other side.
The gates of hell are open wide.

The reaper waits to harvest souls
After the final death bell tolls.
Heed the call - fade to black.
Beyond the point of turning back.

The sum of all your morbid fears.
Silently waiting all these years.

[Repeat chorus]

[Spoken:]
"That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange eons even death may die."

[Repeat chorus]
