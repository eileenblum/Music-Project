Welcome to this horror show
The time we have is running low.
Don't be surprised by what you see
This is the way it has to be.

So let the tragedy unfold.
A timeless tale for ages told.
The race toward the end of days.
The plight of man, his wicked ways.

[1st chorus:]
Behind the curtain,
The hand of fate.
Enter, the conqueror worm.

If all the world is like a stage
Then we're performers in a cage.
Exposed for all the world to see
Condemned for all eternity.

[2nd chorus:]
His path is certain,
He lies in wait.
Enter, the conqueror worm.

[Bridge]
Like a cancer it has grown.
The likes of which you've never known.
An open wound that cannot heal.
The constant pain is all we feel.

[Repeat 1st chorus]

[Repeat 2nd chorus]
