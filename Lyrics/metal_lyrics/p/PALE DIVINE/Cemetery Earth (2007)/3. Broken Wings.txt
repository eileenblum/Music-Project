Seeking out the hidden place,
Where coldness grips me.
Shadows pass to tempt my fate. I'm pulled down to see
Those who've gone before their time.
Their spirits whisper.
Guard the light from whence you came, for it is fleeting.

[Chorus:]
Burning skies - eternal void.
Falling to my fate, I'm slipping.
Broken wings to fly upon.
Lift me from the fear that's gripping me.

(It) matters not what's come before,
The future lingers.
Take the stories of my past,
For they hold answers.
Wisdom screams out from my mind,
My heart won't listen.
Save me someone from these trials,
Or please bear this with me

[Repeat chorus]
