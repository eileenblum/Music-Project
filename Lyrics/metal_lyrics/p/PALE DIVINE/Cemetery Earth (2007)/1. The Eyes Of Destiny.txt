Stories forgotten,
Once we roamed the earth alone.
Mystery surrounds us,
But forever legend grows.

[Chorus:]
The fate of those who see.
The eyes of destiny
Shall set them free.

Living in silence,
The stones of earth our home.
Walking amongst them,
Blind to the signs they've shown.

[Chorus:]
From all the pain they see.
The eyes of destiny
Shall set them free.

Innocent the victims
Of the ones who don't believe.
Driven by visions,
Of a world we can't conceive.

[Chorus:]
The fate of those who've seen.
The eyes of destiny
Now they are free.
