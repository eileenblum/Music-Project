Death riders from above have come to bring an end.
On wings of mayhem the warriors descend.
Those who defy will know the power that they hold.
Prepare for battle soon our vengeance will unfold.

[Chorus:]
Seeking our destiny
The burning bridge of night
Brings us home.
Gods of war hear our cry.
Thunder roars
As lightnung cracks the sky.

Onward to glory ride we sound the battle cry.
Fight 'til the battles won let blood rain from the sky.
With sword and shield held high we face the enemy.
Send the bastards back to hell for all eternity.

[Repeat chorus]

[Bridge:]
On dragon ships we sail
Across the raging sea
Call forth the sacred ones
Lead us to victory

Call upon the outcast souls for whom we seek revenge.
Death riders from above have come to bring an end.
Onward to glory ride we sound the battle cry.
Fight 'til the battles won let blood rain from the sky.
