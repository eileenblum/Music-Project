This is where we lay to rest
The sins of yesterday.
In the hope that someday soon,
This too shall pass away.

Scattered are the ashes where
The faithful died in vain.
Martyrs for a dying world
Their souls cry out in pain.

[Chorus:]
Walking like the living dead their faces cold and gray.
Sickness to insanity they watch their world decay.
Soldiers of misfortune tell me what is your life worth.
Buried and forgotten in this cemetery earth.

Father please forgive them
They know not what they do.
In their darkest hour
They'll come crawling back to you.

[Repeat chorus]
