A word from father to son.
Be careful where you turn.
Your life has only begun.
There's still so much to learn.

[Chorus:]
Walking down that lonely road.
God knows it's been too long.

And when the damage is done,
Just let those bridges burn.

I tried to follow my heart
To set my spirit free.
But I found out from the start
It wasn't meant to be.

[Repeat chorus]

Two souls that drifted apart
Still it keeps haunting me.
