There you go,
What did I do to make you happy all this time?
And I, I donât feel alive as everybody
Till the nail becomes satisfied engulfed living in Your right hand
I see You coming through the night
Beware all the signs that lurk there
I see You coming through the night
Beware all the signs that lurk there, theyâre in spit disaster
And youâre afraid to move
I donât know how Iâm made for such a time as this
I donât know how Iâm made,
for such a time as this has come from grace
To make way for the King to take his rightful place
Complete disaster is heading on my way
But Iâm the master of everything I say itâs come to now
I donât know how Iâm made for such a time as this
Has come from grace to make way for the King to take his rightful place
Reveal the curtain from my eyes
And crucify me
I donât know how Iâm made for such a time
