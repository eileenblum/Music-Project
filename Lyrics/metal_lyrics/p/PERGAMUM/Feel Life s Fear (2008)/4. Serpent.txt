Its time for our escape âcause we are gnashing from the mud
You came with risen faith and gave us fangs to rise above
Itâs not the evil that made our kindness hiss
Itâs the temptation that stole our serpentâs kiss
âCause its time to bring on the chaos
My workâs done here, let me maul my prey
Stop me before I canât say the creature from within me wants to have my destiny
The taste of your corpse is exciting to me the creature from within wants to have my destiny
And we are all murdered of delicacy and I canât avoid this monster from living inside me
You have no time, run faster and forward you will run
Take your weapon take your weapon âcause this is not a march
Theyâre coming, keep running âcause now its time to charge
You tore out my artery and I am grateful for your dying
Blood lust is my ecstasy and I am hardly there.
Grab the bodies take them to me
Is that all youâve got
And all you see in your dreams is fear, problem
Surely we will not be discarded to blank out all the problems
Bite me
I pray an avalanche kills you
You wonât demise me of my faith
You tore out my freedom
