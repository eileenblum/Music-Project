War, Well I listen watch them escape from prison
To hassle by now it hurts so badly
To love me Iâll show you what Iâm made of
Destroy me, Iâll give you my heart and soul
In case I donât come home to where you are
Bring me the first born of the murderer
They wonât be happy when Iâm through with you
Itâs in the air baby I feel it too
All the boys who the dance floor didnât love
And all the girls whose lips couldnât move fast enough
Scream until your lungs give out
This ainât a scene itâs a arms race
In case I donât come home to where you are Iâll be your star
You wonât know when
Dear father give me the strength to say
Destroyer leave me to walk alone
Destroy my sorrow NASA ride
And leave my friendâs tower wide
Tell me tomorrow misery
Until the end lie or die
Destroy my sorrow NASA ride
And leave my friend you will die
Kill me tomorrow bother me until the very end
I will save you still
When they lock you in the iron cage
I will save you still you will run free
Dear Father give me the strength to say
Destroyer canât win now canât walk on me
I canât find the keys to the car I wana wana save
Nothing can stop even the world - Iâve had enough
Everything I kill I wanna save wanna save
Beter fiell per swa
Canât help me
Like a voice of the almighty the sound of a trumpet from an army
The way to be
Like the indecision of a man battered and beaten like a drum
The enemy
Open my eyes too
Donât know why we feel so alive
Just to keep it all inside with the question why
And I canât see my friends all die
Just keep me understanding in the way off
Life count it one two three
Donât you fall away from me
Hell walking in my shoes
Donât you ever lose
