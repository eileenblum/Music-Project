They brought out the dead to wage war on me.
At least through pain I feel something.
I have no lords in my life. I have no whore in my heart.
If I'm so alone, why do I feel at home?
Fake smiles, fake feelings, flesh fueled by gluttony.
I asked her what she feared, she said my fucking name.
Rightfully so, I brought them to their knees. Rightfully so, I brought them.
When I wake up, you'll be next me. You won't wake up again.
I can't see, I can't hear. I can't see, I can't hear, I can't feel anything.
I hung her as the sun set, and I quote "the world will revolve without you."
There never was, never will be any closure.
I have no lords in my life. I have no whore in my heart.
Get fucked. I own the in-between.
At least through your pain, I can feel something, anything.
I'll make the dead weep, bring them to their knees.
I'll make the dead weep, bring them to me.
