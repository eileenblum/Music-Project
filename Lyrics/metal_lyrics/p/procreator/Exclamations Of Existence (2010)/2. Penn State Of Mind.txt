When will you get this through your fucking head?
I don't fuck what I don't respect.
I wouldn't crawl inside of you for the world.
Your so quick to change just like the rest of them, fuck the rest of them.
Your concept of forever is a fucking joke.
And I was so naive to think you'd never fuck anyone but me.
I put you on top of the world, now someone else is on top of you.
Bow out now with what little self respect you have left, for fucks sake.
I'll take your ring finger with me as a constant reminder.
Do they taste good? Do you taste the same?
I cannot fathom touching your skin again.
So smile pretty dear, this rounds on me, a toast "to immaturity."
When it ends you won't have a jaw to even open.
Keep pretending it's okay, we both know that it has to end this way, so face me.
I'm Putting You In Your Place.
You belong on your back.
You're nothing without your crutch, you're nothing without me.
I'll be the one smiling, when you end. When you end...
