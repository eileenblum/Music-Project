Hands and knees on the ground.
Don't face me. You're right where you belong. Beneath me, your empty.
It's so fucking obvious your father was never around (he left you).
Keep on pretending you can swallow all this shame (he hates you).
I'd rather waste time on my hand then give you the satisfaction.
Keep on pretending you can swallow all this shame.
Your mouth is wide and your well runs deep.
It's running dry and you're running out of time.
So gain all of your affection from the chosen many, fuck your insides.
I'm so intrigued, your kind is so, so quick to breed.
Keep pulling yourself under, keep running your mouth.
You'd better keep drinking, try and numb the pain.
Your mouth is wide and your well runs deep.
It's running dry and you're out of time.
Keep on pretending you can swallow all of this shame thrust inside you.
Weed out the weak, make room for the righteous.
So quick to breed, your kind so unworthy.
Watch as I drag er body through the streets.
Her cervix leaked the entire way.
It stained the streets, it stained the streets.
Watch as I drag her body
it stained the streets, it stained the streets.
