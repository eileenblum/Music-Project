I pray you never know how it feels
to feel nothing at all
I have my legs stretched for coffin length
Every smile, every laugh, is a great deception
They make life look worth living
because they haven't seen it through my eyes
I avoid heights these days
because they're much too fucking tempting
There's no one left to trust
There's no one left to confide in
For the first fucking time in my short life
I hope I truly don't live till tomorrow
Like any sane man, I used to fear death
These days I only fear my acceptance of it
I'd rather be one with death than be life's bitch
I'd rather be one with death than be like this
I was born to die and I will act accordingly
I didn't pray to god, I just came to terms
I envy those I used to look down upon
Who couldn't see the world for what it really was
I'm not the man she loved
I'm not the boy they raised
I'm not the friend you had
I am the walking fucking dead
I'm more dead than you will ever know
That pale horse should've taken me years ago 
Fucking bury me
Next to the corpse of my brother
Together again to rot forever (to rot forever)
Like any sane man (sane man)
I used to fear death (fear death)
Now I only fear (only fear)
My acceptance of it
Bury me, fucking bury me
