Give me life for a new day.
I don't want to stay buried in this fucking grave.
Will I remain slave to this body dissipating in grey?
I've got insects crawling through my veins and I can't find a way to escape.

I've lost my compass, I've lost my way.
I sit and stare at the flowers on my fucking grave.

I carve my name into headstones to remind the world I died years ago.

You are haunted by the son you never wanted.
I was born dead.

Home the overlapping cracks in the road sown to the flowers and stones.
I cannot stand these colors or tones, so lead me where I don't need to roam.

You may have gave me life though you took it away the day you strayed and left me consumed grey.
You may have gave me life though you took it away the day you strayed and left me.
I was nothing.

Please father, put your needle down.
Stay with me, help raise me off the ground.
Please mother, don't be angry now.
All I've ever done was try to make you proud.
