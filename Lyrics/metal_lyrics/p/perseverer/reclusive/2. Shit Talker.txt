Yeah, raise your hands in the air with me if you've ever been told that you could never be anything, anyone, you're only pathetic.
Don't let them get to you, now don't you fucking let it.

I've lived my life.
I've learnt my name, no regrets.
Though can you say the same?

We'll stand strong, we'll stand brave.
We'll stand by each other through the darkest of days.
They can say what they want.
They can say what they feel.
We don't hear a word they say.

Yeah, raise your hands in the air with me if you've ever been told that you could never be anything, anyone, you're only pathetic.
Donât let them get to you, now don't you fucking let it.

You're just a fucking mess dressed in regret from the success that you never met.
You can't keep up with the rest.
That's what you get when you fuck with the best.

You'll be strangled by the smoke and wrapped beneath the water.
Shit talker, I'm calling you out.
Shit talker.

We'll stand strong, we'll stand brave.
We'll stand by each other through the darkest of days.
They can say what they want.
They can say what they feel.
We don't hear a word they say.
