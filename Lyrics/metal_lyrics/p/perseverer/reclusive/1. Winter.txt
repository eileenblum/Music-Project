And when night hits we summon the dead.
Reunited with a shrouded love in this broken bed.
The love we shared starts to fray.
A heart hanging from a thread.
When will I find my way?

The hands I use to hold onto became the rope around my fucking neck.
So tell me what the fuck is left inside this caving chest?
An empty shell of the man I was lacking anything but regret.

We took a vow that night amongst the light of a winter moon.
Staring at stars as we whittled our names into the woods.
You left me lurking in silence, searching for a life amidst the dead.
An empty shell of the man I was, lacking anything but regret.

I will not fall for this winter plague.
My legs grow numb and these nights grow vague.
I will not fade away.

Like roses in the night we wilt upon the shadow we form.
Forever bathed moonlight, bleeding from our own thorns.

Like roses in the night we wilt upon the shadow we form.
Forever bathed moonlight.

You speak with silver though your words remain in rust.
Captured in your eyes.
You are my high.
You are a must.
I must confess I cannot stand where I am left.
The dreams we once wove withers with emptiness.
