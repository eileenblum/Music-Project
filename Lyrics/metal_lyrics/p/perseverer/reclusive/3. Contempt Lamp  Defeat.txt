I've spent years tending these absent arteries.
Eroding by your side has never felt so hard for me.
Contempt &amp; defeat, the fuel that my body seems to seep and bleed.

I'm caught in this void I created on my own.
I can't stand another second living this routine.
Bearing this weight has left me bare to the bone, I can promise you that this is killing me.

I am still breathing.
I'm stronger than I was the day before.
All of these demons, I've picked them up and threw them out the door.
And I'll move forward.
Tomorrow is another day to live.
I'll never forget this.
It's time to move on, it's time to forgive.

And I know that you knew that it was killing me, I could not change the view.
I sat for years in soil waiting for you to bloom.
I only seemed to share these nights with the moon.
It was you.

Don't you forget I was there for you, standing under the weight slowly shading blue.
I wish that I could undo everything to do with you.

What my eyes seemed to avoid was the flame singeing a void.
Pouring smoke into your lungs.
You were the song I wish I never fucking sung.

I am still breathing.
I'm stronger than I was the day before.
All of these demons, I've picked them up and threw them out the door.
And I'll move forward.
Tomorrow is another day to live.
I'll never forget this.
It's time to move on, it's time to forgive.
