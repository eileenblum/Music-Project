Come forth and rid me of this fucking anger, it drives deep inside tearing at my god damn mind.
My morals are left a blur.
The only hope that I have is that you get what you deserve.
I can see you shaking in your skin, scared to face the demon you let in.

I've been waiting forever to see your face, from dusk till dawn I wait.

Every day is a constant reminder of what you've become and every night is the same, a new breath to feel numb.
Every day is a constant reminder of what you've become and every night is the same, a new breath to feel numb.

You spineless fucking pig I hope you burn for what you did.
You spineless fucking pig I hope you burn for what you did.

You have no fucking backbone, an antagonist of sticks and stones.
I hope you burn, burn, burn for what you did to her.
Burn, burn, burn for what you did to her.

Every day is a constant reminder of what you've become and every night is the same, a new breath to feel numb.
Every day is a constant reminder of what you've become and every night is the same, a new breath to feel numb.

And when the day finally comes that I can speak my mind I hope you realize that you're out of time.
The day you're gone is the day I live.
I'll keep this hatred close and never forgive.
Never forgive.

It's a certain shade of black thatâs crawling through my veins.
A venom that I can't seem to shake.
Never forgive.
