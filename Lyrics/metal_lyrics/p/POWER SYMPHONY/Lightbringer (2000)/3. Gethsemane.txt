[D'Orlando / Cecconi]

"Stay you here and watch with me"

Drink my blood
Eat my body
In memory of me

Take this chalice away from me
Is there no one awake
In the hour of my misery (Take this chalice away)?
The hour of the dark this hour
(Of pain)

I've been their wonder child
Now my world is turning to dust
I've been their shining star
Now as it's over

They are sleeping
They are sleeping
They closed their eyes
As the end of me closes in
They are sleeping

Take this chalice away from me
Is it true
They know not what they do to me?
(They know what they do)
This silence is a thorn in my heart
This silence
(That kills)

So far I have been strong
Now I feel my time is almost through
And I have played my part
The crowds have turn their back to me

They are sleeping
They are sleeping
They closed their eyes
As the end of me closes in
They are sleeping

Open your eyes it will be late
When you all wake up
You will be lost
You will despair when I am gone
Like I've never really been
Among you living beings
Beings

Take this chalice away from me
Is there no one awake while I shed my tears?
(The last in this world)
In this hour of pain
Take this chalice away
(Take this chalice away)
