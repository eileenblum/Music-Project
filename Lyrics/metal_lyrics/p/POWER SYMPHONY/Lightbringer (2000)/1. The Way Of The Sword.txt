[D'Orlando / Cecconi]

For she who steps on the way of the sword
The path gets harder at every turn
Sanctuary she'll find no more
Among the people of her lot
She will leave the past behind
The Goddess knows what she is to find

Past is left behind
For the one on the way of the sword
Fools are meant to fall
They'll get lost along the way
Past is left behind
For the one on the way of the sword
Fools are meant to fall
I am she who's on the way of the sword

For she who knows not the way she must walk
Life is sweet but with little reward
She who wields a sword
Must be prepared to shed her blood
Pain she must endure
And know too well that she must be strong

Past is left behind
For the one on the way of the sword
Fools are meant to fall
They'll get lost along the way
Past is left behind
For the one on the way of the sword
Fools are meant to fall
I am she who's on the way of the sword

So many farewells
Many tears you must shed before your journey ends
Ot it's only just begun
For a glory wish there is much to sacrifice
So many farewells
Many tears you must shed before your journey ends
Ot it's only just begun
For a glory wish there is much to sacrifice

Past is left behind
For the one on the way of the sword
Fools are meant to fall
They'll get lost along the way
Past is left behind
For the one on the way of the sword
Fools are meant to fall
I am she who's on the way of the sword
