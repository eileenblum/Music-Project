[D'Orlando]

Break of the day
Light of the sun
Make us forget what we faced in the night
The horrors that lurk in the dark
The perils that lie on the path

I've heard a song of men
The short living humans of far away lands
I've heard a song of men
That trouble their lives with fortune and fame
When tomorrow's unknown to them all
They wish glory to find on their path

Break of the day
Light of the sun
Make me forget I'm alone in the dark

I've heard a song of men
Lost in the dark and far from their land
I've heard a song of men
Lost on the way to fortune and fame
When tomorrow's unknown to them all
They wish glory to find on their path

When tomorrow's unknown to them all
They wish glory to find on their path

Break of the day
Light of the sun
Keep this darkness away from my heart
And guide me far on my way
And watch over me through the day

I've heard a song of love
Sung to their loves in faraway homes
I've heard a song of war
For power and glory they live by the sword
When tomorrow's unknown to them all
They wish glory to find on their path

I've heard a song of men
The short living humans of far away lands
I've heard a song of men
That trouble their lives with fortune and fame
When tomorrow's unknown to them all
They wish glory to find on their path

I've heard a song of men
I've heard a song of men
Wishing for glory
