[D'Orlando / Cecconi]

Isn't it tempting?
The matter and the flesh
Isn't it charming?
Can't you see who I am?
I am your angel
I am your angel
Of the dark

I am matter and flesh

Time before the time
Life before it ever started
Then I was created
An angel to behold your shining light
Your ever shining light
I have seen the forst sunrise
Bringing light into the world (countless worlds)
And the dark of thousand nights
Descending on the Earth (on this Earth)
Before I fell from grace
(Before I fell from Heaven denied)

Do you know me by my name (by my name)?
Lucifer your angel (of sin)
You have made me who I am (who I am)
I am the light bringer (your dearest angel of sin)
Do you know me by my name?
Lucifer that brings the light

I am matter and flesh
The matter and the flesh
(Shaped by your hands of god)

I think therefore I am
I think therefore I sin (matter and flesh)
I want power to create
And comprehend all things (with my mind)
All that there is to see (with these eyes)
Time before the time
Light before it ever shone on men
Lost forever
Into the abyss to rule in Hell
Do you remember loving me?
(Do you remember desire?)

Do you know me by my name (by my name)?
Lucifer your angel (of sin)
You have made me who I am (who I am)
I am the light bringer (your dearest angel of sin)
Do you know me by my name?
Lucifer that brings the light

Do you remember when I was but a thought
In your mind of god?
Prime Evil in your thought
Beautiful as only I can be
I seduce the foolish mortal being (as is thy will of god)
My name until the end of time
Is Lucifer (your angel of sin) that brings the light

Isn't it tempting?
Isn't it tempting?
Isn't it tempting?

I am matter and flesh
The matter and the flesh
(Shaped by your hands of god)

Time before the time (before temptation)
(The matter and the flesh)
Light before the light (light before desire)
Light before the fall (from Heaven denied)
Light before the fall
