[D'Orlando / Cecconi]

Save your foolish Evillot
Or let me die
Let me close my eyes
I need to rest
I'm sick of the light
Sick of the light
Evil I serve I swear a thousand times

I swear I'll never dream of goodness (Never dream of goodness)
Never displease the Lord of darkness (Never dream of goodness)
I swear I hate the light forbidden (Never dream of goodness)
And on my blood
I swear that I will never dream of goodness
Again

You know my darkened heart (My darkest thoughts)
A raven black
As the dead of night
Without the stars
What more should I say?
You hold my life in your hands
Upon my blood I swear I hate the light

I swear I'll never dream of goodness (Never dream of goodness)
Never displease the Lord of darkness (Never dream of goodness)
I swear I hate the light forbidden (Never dream of goodness)
And on my blood
I swear that I will never dream of goodness
Again

There's no turning back
There's no turning back
From the way of the dark
I have taken
Once it's taken
Darkness my wish
There's no mercy for the weak
When you swear you hate the light of the sun

Save your foolish Evillot
From disgrace
Unlock my chains
I need to rest
Save your foolish Evillot
Or let me die
