[D'Orlando / Cecconi]

Lonely is the way of the necromancer
Dark is the path to the secret knowledge
Runes just talk to me in dreams
Such secrets they reveal
Unknown to humankind
Words of magic
Mists disclosing at my will
The veil of the unreal
Unfolds before my eyes
Gods mind close to mine

Do you hear me gods of all that lives
Or did you turn your back to me?
Do you hear my voice is calling loud
For you to show me all I need (to know)?
On a quest for knowledge I have found
Only sorrow

Lost I have wondered the lands of magic
Doom the reward on my quest of knowledge
Runes fell silent in my dreams
They nevermore reveal
The truth beyond mankind
Words of power
Lost forever in the mist
Their secrets they will keep
Unknown to mortal eyes
Gods have let me down

Do you hear me gods of all that lives
Or did you turn your back to me?
Do you hear my voice is calling loud
For you to show me all I need (to know)?
On a quest for knowledge I have found
But this darkness

In dream dusts we can indulge
But the sparkle of true
Magic has gone and long lost
Forever

Do you hear me gods of all that lives
Or did you turn your back to me?
Do you hear my voice is calling loud
For you to show me all I need?
On a quest for knowledge I have found
But this sorrow
