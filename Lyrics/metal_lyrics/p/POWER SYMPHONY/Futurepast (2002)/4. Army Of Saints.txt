[D'Orlando / Cecconi]

Bless our souls we go to fight,
In Your name we'll kill or die.
We confide You'll be with us,
Death awaits the chosen one.

Kill with no remorse,
for you're in the light.
Die with no regrets,
Army of saints.

Why? My conscience cries so loud,
I feel so cold inside.
Murderer I will be no more
In the name of my faith

Forgive me!
My soul will drift through the dark,
I betrayed the army of light.
Forgive me!
My bare bones will lie in foreign land,

I betrayed the army of saints,
I betrayed the army of saints.

Bless our swords and guide us all,
Save our lives and give us force.
Spill their blood and take their souls,
Lead us all to holy war.

Kill with no remorse,
for You're in the light.
Die with no regrets,
army of saints.

Why, if we must bring them light,
I see the death around?
Forgive me Lord,
I was not born to kill.

Forgive me!
My soul will drift through the dark,
I betrayed the army of light.
Forgive me!
My bare bones will lie in foreign land,
I betrayed the army of saints,
I betrayed the army of saints.

God of all mankind,
of all that lives and dies
on this Earth,
the time to pay for what I did
has come and there's no mercy
for me.
As I die afraid and alone,
Thy shall be done
(Hallowed be Thy name)
as above so below.
