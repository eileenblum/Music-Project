[D'Orlando / Cecconi]

Nine moons went by
And I look into your eyes
Nine moons went by
And I hold you in my arms

I name thee Mordred

Lost in the forest
Lost beneath the waning moon
Twice I've seen her face
And to me she carries the news:
"Morgaine Lefay, dearest of my lot
The winter cold will bring a son
To fairy land of Avalon"

I'll name thee Mordred
I'll name thee Mordred

[Chorus:]
Nine moons went by
And I look into your eyes
I hold your tiny hands
That will guide men at arms
Nine moons went by
And I hold you in my arms
Welcome my child in this world
That will turn your pure heart

Lost in the forest
I have called upon her name
Lady of the lake
Then she came and spoke to me
Words of warning
"Morgaine Lefay, dearest of my kind
Kill the your baby in the cradle
Or never let him see the light"

I'll name thee Mordred
I'll name thee Mordred

[Chorus:]
Nine moons went by
And I look into your eyes
I hold your tiny hands
That will guide men at arms
Nine moons went by
And I hold you in my arms
Welcome my child in this world
That will turn your pure heart

Forever thankful for your life
To me my child
Because I brought you into this world
So cold
That will turn you in to an evil man

I name thee Mordred.
(Son of a king, blood inpure of king and witch)
I name thee Mordred
(Son a king, blood impure of brother and sister)
I name thee Mordred.

Nine moons went by
And I look into your eyes
Nine moons went by
And I hold you in my arms
