[Michela D'Orlando, Marco Cecconi]

A stranger will come sent by the Gods
his land lies destroyed
A king comes to build a new throne
Beautiful Ilium your name is well known
rumours have brought us the news of your fall
I see your ruin I see my own I see my own

Heroes of the land take your lances in your hands
put your armour on follow me to the shore
we shall gather at the ships we shall face the foreign king
We shall win

Shores of my land, war will be soon
blood onto you
will flow as the flames will arise
Powerful heroes your names will be known
None will forget of your pride and your worth
I see your ruin I warn you all
rumours of war

Heroes of the land take your lances in your hands
put your armour on follow me to the shore
we shall gather at the ships we shall face the foreign king
We shall win

[Guitar Solo: Marco]
[Guitar Solo: Mauro]

No more I'll wonder at the sun rising from this waters deep
Trojan ships are sailing through heading for this land
Merciless Gods who never mind of mortal men
my time is at hand but proud I will stand
Souls of the elder welcome me when I have gone
my fate is sealed my battle is lost
And I am lost with my land
all I have done after all it has been in vain.

He comes from the fabled Troy
Aeneas his name
Shores of mine... Shores in flames.
