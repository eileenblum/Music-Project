"Dies irae, dies illa, solvet seclum in favilla
teste David cum Sibilla
Quanto tremor est futurus, quando iudex est venturus
cunta stricte discussurus" [from the Dies Irae, Mass in Latin]

Veni mecum ad Inferna

"When I had journeyed half of our life's way
I found myself within a shadowed forest
for I had lost the path that does not stray" [from Dante's Inferno]
