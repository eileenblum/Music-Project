[Marco Cecconi, Michela D'Orlando]

I have seen it all.
All has been foretold.
Now...

Now it's time for power
now it's time for change
for those who've been chosen
to follow their fate
dying in glory or living to serve
This final battle will lead us to hell

So it's been written and so it shalt be
powerful evil will fall on its knees
Warriors almighty deliver this land
avengers of sorrow, this ultimate stand

Battles in the twilight, all the way to hell
Written in the pages of the past lies our fate
Battles in the twilight, on and on I sing
Ancient tales forgotten I will tell you all my friends

[Guitar Solo: Marco]

I have come from ancient land
I have come from far
I will tell you all the stories that should not be told
of the power and the glory

Forbidden tales of the battles in the twilight
I'm the one that will bring you the truth
Ancient words will be spoken in the twilight
battle hymns will arise
Have I been chosen to see another day?
Have I been chosen to tell another tale?

I am the bard (the one who's calling)
I am the bard (the chosen one)
(I am the bard) the one who's calling
(I am the bard) the chosen one

All has been foretold
Tales have all been told
All is said and done

Battles in the twilight, all the way to hell
Written in the pages of the past lies our fate
Battles in the twilight, on and on I sing
Ancient tales forgotten I will tell you all my friends

[Guitar Solo: Marco]

Now it's time for power
now it's time for change
those who've been chosen
will follow their fate

Armies facing in the twilight
Armies facing in the twilight
I am the bard, I've seen it all
I am the bard, I've seen it all
