[Marco Cecconi, Michela D'Orlando]

Nothing in life will last
Now has become past
If memories are just like dreams
they'd fade like never been

They leave you alone
feeling cold as stone
alone and crying out

with nowhere to hide
and a merciful lie
won't save you for the night

Won't ease your sorrow
Who knows sorrow better than me?
Who didn't make mistakes?
Who can blame me now more then myself?
But still won't help to bear the curse of every man

The curse of every man
forget and err again
The curse of every man
forget and err again

Time heals everything
Time long past, gone numbering tears
Ashamed to think of my own life
When light fades from the sky

Drifting away
Numbing the pain
Alone and crying out

Ever afraid
As the day slip away
Ever on my way to hell

[Guitar Solo: Mauro]

Night shelter me
Save me from the cruel light of day
Spare my eyes
The cruel sight of what I truly am

[Guitar Solo: Marco]

The curse of every man
forget and err again
The curse of every man
forget and err
