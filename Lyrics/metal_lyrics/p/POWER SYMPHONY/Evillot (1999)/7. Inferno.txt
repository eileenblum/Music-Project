"Virgil, are you a shade or a man?
Shade am I, that once was man" [from Dante's Inferno]

[Guitar Solo: J.J.Angel]

Vergelius (Vergelius be my guide) will guide you (You all )
beyond the gates of Hell
You'll join eternal darkness
You'll see the souls that died in sin (Like yourself)
your eyes will burn eternally

"Virgil, are you a shade or a man?" [from Dante's Inferno]

Show me the place where I'll be damned
I have never seen Hell
Vergelius leads me hand in hand
stumbling step by step
Down to the place where I'll be damned
Charon ferries souls
on lurid waters
that darken on the way
for those who fell from grace

"The gates of Hell are open wide
I hear the spirits' cry in the dawnless everlasting night
Justice divine (This is the place of doom)
has weigh'd the doom is clear (Sighs and wailings loud)
all hope renounce ye lost who enter here" [from Dante's Inferno]

"Virgil, embark with me on Charon's boat" [from Dante's Inferno]

Show me the place where I'll be damned
I have never seen Hell
Vergelius leads me hand in hand
stumbling step by step
Down to the place where I'll be damned
Charon ferries souls
on lurid waters
that darken on the way
for those who fell from grace
