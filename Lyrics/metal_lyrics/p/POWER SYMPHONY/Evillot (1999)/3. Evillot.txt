[Marco Cecconi, Michela D'Orlando]

Sinister as the day of my birth
death descends, shades the stormy north
Snow covered peaks will be painted with stains red of blood
as the anthem begins
Echoes the chanting, the oath has been taken
under the ominous sky
Chaos has begun

[Guitar Solo: Marco]

Evil I serve
beware of his command
Evil I serve
upon my word I swear
Evil I serve
I scorn the light of the scorching sun.

Feel the will, utter the raving words
swear the oath to my rightful lord
Eve of the blooding, I'm leaving this world sick of light
to return nevermore
Stronger then ever, uncanny like never before
is the power I feel
Chaos has begun.

[Guitar Solo: Marco]

Evil I serve
beware of his command
Evil I serve
upon my word I swear
Evil I serve
to scorn the light of the scorching sun

Eve of the blooding, the change is not complete
and goodness overcomes me
memories are talking to me
They speak to me, they scream to me, they tell me things
They say I've gone astray...
They say "You've gone astray"
Maleficent fate.

But echoes the anthem arcane from the depth
Evil I serve
beware of his command
Evil I serve
I've gone too far from the scorching sun

Sinister is his warning upon the wind
my Lord has come to torment me, grinning at my agony
He knows I crave for light... He knows I crave for the scorching sun
Sinister and ominous was the day of my beginning
the darkest day, the final pain, slowly ends and fades
and I crave for light... I crave for the scorching sun
Sinister and evil-hearted as I am from my beginning
I crave for light... I crave for the sun to shine.
