Emelie is sad
Emelie is sad
Emelie is sad
She used to be glad
Now Emelie's been had
Emelie's been had
Emelie's been had
She might never be glad

Oh, but there is something deep inside her
Oh, if we could only see inside her

Now she's mine, all broken inside
A product of your fine
Mortar grind
Every crime is seeping inside
Until they're all mine
Burn them away

Jenny used to smile
Jenny used to smile
Jenny used to smile
Now she'll only hide
Jenny's in denial
Jenny's in denial
Jenny's in denial
She might never smile

Oh, but there is something deep inside her
Oh, I know 'cause I have been inside her

Now she's mine, all broken inside
A product of your fine
Mortar grind
Every crime is seeping inside
Until they're all mine
Burn them away
Burn them away --

I used to be mine
I used to be mine
I used to be mine
Now I'm feeling blind
I'm too deep inside
I'm too deep inside
I'm too deep inside
This mortar grind --

Now it's mine, all broken inside
A product of their fine
Mortar grind
(Burn it away)
All this vile
Sulphur and brine
I keep deep inside
(Oh) Burn it away
Burn it away
Oh, burn it away
Burn it away
