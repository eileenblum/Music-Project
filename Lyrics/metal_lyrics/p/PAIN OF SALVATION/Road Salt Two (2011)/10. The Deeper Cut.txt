All my life I have been afraid.
All my life scared to lose my way.
All my life led me to today.
The day when I must learn the hardest way.
Every step leading to this day.
The day I learn to lose and fail.

A deeper cut into the flesh of life.
A sharper kind of knife.

A deeper cut into the throat of grey.
Come take me far away.
Come take me far away.
Lead me astray.

The deepest cut will never really mend.
The deepest cut might kill you in the end.
The deepest cut is playing not to win.
It's what you hear in every word I sing.
It's beauty in the ugliest of things.
It's birds that fly with broken wings.

A deeper cut into the flesh of life.
A sharper kind of knife.

A deeper cut into the throat of grey.
Come colors lead the way.
Come colors lead the way.
Into the wild
(Into the wild...)
Into the wild
(Into the wild)
Into the wild
(Into the wild)
Into the wild
(Into the wild)

Today I go beyond control
(Into the wild)
Beyond all purpose, aim or goal
(Into the wild)
To win my soul
(Into the wild)
'Cause today I choose to lose my way
(Into the wild)
To fall and fail
(Into the wild...)
I choose the wilderness today
(Into the wild)

Into the wild...
