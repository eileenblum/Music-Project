It was '79 and the world seemed more kind.
And it was still okay to be modest.
The sixties were gone but their soul lingered on.
And the eighties were still just a promise.
And I remember me and you.
Two children of six still playing with sticks.
And whatever we found in the forest.
Our grandpas were strong and our parents still young.
And the world seemed a little more honest.
And I remember me and you.
All still fine.
1979.
Left behind.
1979.
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
'Cause I remember.
Me and you.
