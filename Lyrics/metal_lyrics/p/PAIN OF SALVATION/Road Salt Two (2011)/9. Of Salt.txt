[Limited Edition Digipack Bonus Track]I've walked this road and fed its hunger
I wore it down, it wore me down

Seen every bend, seen every crossroad
Now I sit down here on the ground

Salt in my face, salt under my boots
Salt is this road, salting my wounds
A boy once king sits here a failure
Salt is this man now sitting down
