[I Gridlock (All Is Mine)]

Silently I sit on this road.
Sifting the dust through my hands.
To feel that I belong.

Silently I weep for my soul.
There's always been something I need.
To feel that I am whole.

I'm taking a trip down the line.
Watching this new state of mind:
âAll is mine!â
"All is mine"

Silently I weep for mankind.
At some point we cut every rope.
To touch the sun.

And suddenly.
And silently.
Like hot air balloons.
Our minds took to the skies.
Hovering above luscious fields.
With a beautiful view.
But this hunger for the ground.
Inside.

And every red-light in town.
Is screaming for lost and for found:
âAll is mine!â

[II The End]

We're all longing to belong.
We're all longing to be home.
Invincible young and strong.
But we lost it all.
When we turned life into a road.
A direction towards a goal.
Ending where no one really wants to go.

And so my friend.
Welcome to the end.
All who won't pretend.
All who cannot mend.
All who lost themselves.
On life's dusty shelves:
No one ever wins.
We're but mortal kings.
Of passing things.

But I see a better man.
His feet on his father's land.
His hand in his mother's hand.
He still belongs.
He's lying there on the shore.
He never asks where to go.
'Cause his is a grounded soul.
He'll always know.

[III On Nous A DonnÃ© La Vie]

Je suis la mer.
C'est pourquoi je dis.
Pour tour mes frÃ¨res.
Pour tous mes amis.
Je vous donne la misÃ¨re:
Je vous donne la vie.
Je vous donne la misÃ¨re:
Je vous donne la vie.

Vous voyez tout en moi.
Vous voyez un dieu.
Je me vois en toi.
Dans chaque lieu.
Je vous donne cette croix.
Je vous donne cette fleur.
Je vous donne cette croix.
Je vous donne cette fleur.

Nous partageons ce sentiment d'impuissance.
Toujours jeunes filles et garÃ§ons sans dÃ©fense.
Silencieusement nous allons.
Silencieusement nous passons.
On nous a donnÃ© la misÃ¨re:
On nous a donnÃ© la vie.
On nous a donnÃ© la misÃ¨re:
On nous a donnÃ© la vie.
On nous a donnÃ© la vie.
On nous a donnÃ© la vie.
