Heal me now.
Remove these old scars from my soul.
Heal me now.
Unhinge this dry skin from my bones.

And even though I can't forget the many times I've cried.
And even though I can't forgive the many ways I've died.
I am healing now.
And I still kick the dust from this road.
And I'm still alive.
Just a little less so.
Than before.

Heal me now.
And wash these old tracks from my road.
Heal me now.
This prodigy walked himself old.

And I'm healing now.
And I'm trying to find my way home.
And I'm still alive.
And I just thought that you should know.
That perhaps I'll cry.
And perhaps I will die.
But for now I'm still alive.
Just a little less so than before.
Just a little less so than before.
Just a little less so than before.
Just a little less so.
Than before.
