I'm far from sober.
And she's far from sane.
When she takes my hand and she pulls me away.

She leads me down to the shoreline.
She leads me down to the shoreline.
She leads me down to the sea.
She pulls me into the water.
And then she whispers to me:

âLove, you know that I can make you stronger.
Love, you know that I can make you brave.
But there's one thing that you must remember:
That I am too far gone for you to save.â

Sand through her fingers.
The night slips away.
She gave me her body.
But never her name.

I followed her to the shoreline.
I'd follow her to the grave.
Two sinking ships in the darkness.
And we are much too close to break away.

And I know that she will make me stronger.
And I know that she will make me see.
And I know that she will make me younger.
But I don't know what more she'll do to me.

And she said:

âYou know that I can make you stronger.
Love, you know that I can make you brave.
But there's one thing that you must remember:
That I am too far gone for you to save.â
