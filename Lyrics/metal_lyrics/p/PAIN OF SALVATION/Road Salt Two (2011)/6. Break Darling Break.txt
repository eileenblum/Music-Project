[Limited Edition Digipack Bonus Track]Wait
If you could ask me to wait
If you could ask me to take a break
Before I fall to pieces and break
If I could ask you to wait
(Wait darling wait on the road to who you really are)
Break
Break
(I'm driven too far)
Break
(If you want to know me just break darling break)
If you dissect me
(If I could ask you to break)
And search through the debris
(But I can't ask you to break)
You'll find my northern star leads to where you are

This wreck you see is still me
I'm just driven too far
Driven too fast
Driven too long
Driven too hard

Driven too fast
Driven too long
Driven too hard
Driven too far
