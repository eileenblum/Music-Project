Tell me my friend
If this is the end
For what do we make amends?
When all has been weighed
Measured and paid
All aces laid
All prayers prayed

I've hidden your knives I've cut down your ropes
Flushed your pills
To save your life

The flowers are dead
Petals all spread
Over the pills
Beside my bed

"We had a good run
Our days in the sun
So come what may"
Fuck all they say
I want to stay

Stay

"We had a good run
Our days in the sun
So come what may"
The crap they say

Stay

I was born in this building
It was the first Tuesday
I had ever seen
And if I live to see tomorrow
It will be my Tuesday
Number 2,119
All has been weighed
All measured and paid
All aces laid
All prayers prayed
Stay

God
I asked for something of my own
With a locked door
I asked for something that I could control
I asked for something cutting to the bone

Hah â I asked for something
Cutting to my bone
Cutting to my bone

God!
God!

Something of my own
