Some nights I just feel this need to run
Some nights I just wanna burn to death
Just like the sun
Some nights I just long to lose control
Some nights I just wish for destiny to touch my soul

It's the feeling that it's all
Too safe and sound
And I need something to shake me up
Or strike me to the ground
A storm to come
And root me up
And let me run
Just burn my wings or touch the sun
So let me fly
Just let me fall
Just let it come

I want to taste it all

I want to falter and fall
I want to run from civility
The flags of morality
Just go with the wild in me
Regardless of nation
Creed or policy
Just pulling you close to me
Just peel off this thin skin of humanity

Sometimes I feel
The beast is the best in me

It's not that I don't want what I have
It's not that I ever want
To make anybody sad
It's not that I wanna hurt myself
No
But some things are better broken
Than left on the shelf
It's the hunger and the restlessness
That call
A sweet vertigo of lust enticing me
To take the fall
So lock me up
Just chain me down

And build a wall
Destroy the wolf and break his crown
Just file his claws and pull his teeth
'Cause when I'm free
I'm gonna taste you all
I'm gonna falter and fall
I wanna give up my dignity
Give in to iniquity
Sleep with my enemy
Explode like a sun
And become pure gravity
Just pulling you into me
It takes everything to refill me

Sometimes I feel
The beast gets the best of me
The beast gets the best of me

And don't think too much
About the ones who'll burn
Every Icarus has had his chance to turn

To burn
To run
To fail
To fall
To turn

It is not for everyone
To touch the sun
You must let them fly
Just let the wild ones run

Don't waste your precious time
Praising the cold
You will freeze to death you'll
Grow so grey and old

Just stay safely on the ground
Just give me all
I'll give you more
Just let me roam
Unlock the door
Release the beast
Just set me free
Cover your eyes!
