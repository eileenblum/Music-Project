I still smell of sweat
Still the scent of my giving in
Try to feel regret
But I want it to stay on my skin

I still fantasize
Close my eyes to be wrong again

Still those fuck-me eyes

As I'm licking the palm of my hand

How the hell
Am I supposed to keep my self
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine
How the hell
Am I supposed to keep my self
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine

I still smell of sex
Still her taste on my fingertips
Try to feel remorse
But it's hard with her wet on my lips

How the hell
Am I supposed to keep my self
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine
How the hell
Am I supposed to keep my self
When you are so damn far away
And everything feels meaningless
And I am not mine

I need something of my own
I need something cutting to the bone

I need something that is mine
If that must be guilt, then fine

How the hell

I wanted something nice, but fine
This guilt is a hole but it's mine
I wanted something nice
This guilt is a hole but it's mine!
