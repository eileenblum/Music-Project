I was born in this building
It was the first Tuesday
I had ever seen
And if I live to see tomorrow
It will be my Tuesday number 
2,119

How life has its way
Of turning your best suit
The wrong way
As if to smile and say
"I feast on irony, my friend.
I'm come-what-may
And it might just be, my friend
That this is your unlucky day
Will you change? What would you give to stay?"

Will I change?
I honestly can't say
I have no promises to trade
For the Lord of come-what-may
To provide me with another day
Every promise that I make
Is a promise I might break

The things we humans say to survive
The promises we make
The lies we tell
Vows we take
The battles we all win to survive
Prices we will pay
Though we all know
We will lose one day

Life is a ride, they say
But there are tickets I will never pay
I'm afraid there'll be no vow today
For any God of come-what-may

You let me live
You let me die
For what I am right here and now
For nothing more than all I am today
I close my eyes...
I do not pray

Promisesâthey tempt me too
Will I change?
I won't be that fool
Maybe for a day, a week
Maybe two
I'm a dreamer physicist
A man-child escapist
The face of death won't make me an evangelist
I close my hands
But not in prayer
Not in prayer
Into fists

I lost the will

The things we humans say to survive
The promises we make
The lies we tell
The vows we take
The battles we all win to survive
The prices we will pay
Though we will lose either way

I lost the will
I lost the way
I haven't lost the faith
It's just lost in me

I lost the will...

The things
That we must say
To pretend
This passing light of day
Is not the end
Is not the end

The things
That we all say
To be saved
The things that we will trade
Just give away
For one more day
We'll smile and tell 
Sweet lies
To chase away
The shadows that play
Cast by the passing light of day
