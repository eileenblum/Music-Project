I never signed onto this mankind
No color, race or creed
felt truly mine
Never had a country or a flag
I never had a culture, kin or kind
I could never really belong
Too loud
Too wild
Too silent or too shy
Too everything is what defines my mind

I've throttled back
I've dialed myself down
I'm done with that
I'll build myself a sun

Will you follow me?
Will you follow me?

This will be my tribe, my family
This will be my flag and nation
This will be my creed, my legacy
Will you follow me?

With me, I promise you will see
Things that your friends never get to see
I'll be too much
There will be no enough
But we'll set flame to everything we touch
I'll take it too far and drive it too hard
We'll fall
And find ourselves alone
Down on red with no way to get home
A reckless ride
But it'll be worthwhile
You'll remember it with longing and with pride
So, will you follow me?

This will be my tribe, my family
This will be my flag and nation
This will be my creed, my legacy
Will you follow me?

Out there
People wait and cheer
While I'm stuck here
Behind this empty stare
I turn the shower tap
Turn it all the way up
To burn this hole a way
I lost a dream today
Lost thirty years today

This has been my tribe, my family
This has been my flag and nation
This has been my creed, my legacy

Now it's only me

This has been my tribe, my family
This has been my generation
This has been my life, my legacy
Will you follow me?
