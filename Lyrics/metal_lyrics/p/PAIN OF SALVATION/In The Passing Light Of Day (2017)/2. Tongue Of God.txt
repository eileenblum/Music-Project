I cry in the shower
and smile in the bed
I cry in the shower
and smile in the bed

"Don't be afraid"
I hear people say
As if it will let me live
if I'm just brave
Then the clouds of death
Would simply draw away

I cry in the shower
and smile in the bed

The things that the living tell 
the not dead
If you only heard them 
as they sound in my head
If you only heard them 
from this bed

What's on your mind, God?
Spit it out!

Tongue of God
Lip my grin
Run your tip over my back skin
I'm not your kissing kin
Tongue of God
Lash right in
Lick me clean on the inside
We were never kissing kin

God loves a jester
God loves a joke
God loves a jester
God loves a joke
I may be stubborn and headstrong but you know I mean well
Too demanding to call up
But too good for Hell
So if you don't love me I might still be OK
Still have enough time to serve a punch line

What's on your tongue, God?
Spit it out!
What's that in your mouth?

Spit!
It!
Out!

Tongue of God
Lip my grin
Run your tip over my back skin
I'm not your kissing kin
Tongue of God
Lash right in
Lick me clean on the inside
We were never kissing

Tongue of God
Lip my grin
Run your tip over my back skin
I'm not your kissing kin
Tongue of God
Lash right in
Lick me clean on the inside
We were never kissing kin

I cry in the shower
and smile in the bed
I cry in the shower
and smile in the bed
I die in the shower
I live in the bed
I cry in the shower
I scream in my head
