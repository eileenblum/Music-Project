Push me over
Make me shiver
You're my cover
Let your river flow
Flow
Flow going high and low
Leave me open
Leave me fretless
Peel my cold skin
Make me reckless
Run
Run
Run for the morning sun

Baby, wrap me in your silent gold
Let the saddest story be untold
Baby, anywhere you go
Anything you do
Is home
Is gold

Take my body
Make it holy
As once you asked me, baby
"How do you roll with God?"

God?

God is what we do now

Baby, wrap me in your silent gold
Let the saddest story be untold
Baby, anywhere you go
Anything you do
Is home

Baby, wrap me in your silent gold
Let the saddest story be untold
Baby, anywhere you go
Anything you do
Is home
Is gold
