Though life has worn us down
Through sun and rain
Your eyes are still the same
Deep blue against all grey

"Love, don't be afraid,"
They seem to say,
"I'll be here for you all the way,
My lover, my best friend."

Do you remember us
That first January
You had just turned nineteen
And I was to be twenty
We fed on politics and poetry
Two children fueled by unbroken dreams

You're watching me slowly slip away
Like the passing light of day
Watching the colors turn to grey
Like the passing light of day
The passing light of day

Better burn out, they say
Than fade away
Some candles last an hour
And others one full day

But I, I wanna be like the sun
That steady flame that burns on and on
And stillâ¦

We're watching me slowly slip away
Like the passing light of day
We're watching the colors turning grey
In the passing light
A lifetime since we met that January
Two young kids feeding on
Politics and poetry
Running on dreams

Ending themeâ¦
Empires have fallen
Nations have been born
The heroes of our childhood
Dead, forgotten or gone
But we still stand
All those times that I went away
All those times that I couldn't stay
I wish that I could give them back
Wish that I could give them back
All those times when I failed on you
All those times that I turned on you
I wish that I could take them back
Just wish that I could take them back

Cos all those times are still here today
All those times they still hurt today
All those moments return today
All those times of "Another day"
You're watching me slowly slip away
Like the passing light of day
Watching all colors turning grey
Like the passing light of day

I need something new
If I could start anew
Would it be the same?
I need something new
To feel whole again
If I only knew
I will see this through
I need something new
Take me home again
If I only knew

All those people who worried us
All those things that were hurting us
None of that can reach me now
None of that can reach me now
All the darkness we thought about
All those things that we fought about
None of that can touch me now
None of that can touch me now
Cos all that matters is here today
All the thoughts that I think today
Every word that we say today
Every second alive today

We're all burning out, fading away
Like the passing light of day
We're all watching the colors turning grey
In the passing light of day
We may wish we could run
Just walk away
From this passing light of day
But at some point we need to stop and say
It's OK
It's OK

"My love, don't be afraid"
I hear you say
"I'll be here for you all the way"
And I just wish that I could smile and say
"Baby, hey
I'm in too much pain to feel afraid
My lover
My best friend"
Lover
Best friend

I'm watching it slowly slip away
Like the passing light of day
Watching the colors turning grey
In the passing light of day
And although I wish
That I could stay
It somehow strangely feels OK
It is what it is
I'll find my way

Through this
Passing lightâ¦
