'...and he actually held up the weapon before our eyes, and there, dressed
in a suit and tie, he smiled and told us with pride in his voice that "this
model was largely represented in the Gulf war!".    
He was so very proper and clean. And so alarmingly blind!'  

Welcome inside the machine  
It hurts!  
Go numb, go blind...
One's drilling out a pipe  
One adjusts the aim  
One makes trigger parts  
Weapons as a game!   

All trapped in killing routine  
Washed clean...
...by this machine   

On these grey walls  
Lovely pictures of the weapons we produce  
But not their actions...

All are part of the big Machine  
We do our job  
"Guilty!"   

But what if we save?  
And what if we solve?  
And what if we build?  
And what...

...what if we lose control?  
What if we lose control?  
What if we lose control?  
What if we lose control?   

(I am just a wheel!)    

...and what if we ...stop?
