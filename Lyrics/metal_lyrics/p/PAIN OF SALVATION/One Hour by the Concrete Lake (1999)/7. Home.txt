[Music: D.Gildenlow]

'The white man, he comes and goes. He can go. ...But that's our homeland for
thousands of years. That's our home, and we will never leave. No matter how
contaminated it gets. We live there! We have always lived there and we will
always live there.'  

This is our home - our roots go deep  
Where our ancestors sleep  
This is the land we've nursed for countless aeons  
But never ours to keep   
My tribe is crying - our land is dying  
But we can't leave - this is our home  
We can't let our past go...   

We're left with your legacy  
Wide awake, deep at our roots  
While you move on exploiting  
We'll sing lullabies for half a million years   

When my son asks why, what will I reply?  
But we can't leave - this is our home  
We can't let our past go...

[D. Gildenlow]

But we can't leave - this is our home!  
If you like concrete alone  
Then don't make your high lives depend  
On that past that you let go... 

[III: Karachay]
