[Music: D.Gildenlow]

'Only the tame birds have a longing. The wild ones fly.'  

So once again  
Another New Year's Eve will ease our pain  
Faith for the few  
And rites that will make us so brave  
So new   
We laugh and we cheer for a Happy New Year  
Happy?   

Candles burn down  
And in the darkness future comes around  
We smile - all aware  
But never speaking of the masks we wear  
Blind!   

Turning mirrors upside down  
Won't make dust fall off the ground  
Hiding wounds won't ease the pain  
Sleep won't make you whole again   

Change the inside!  
...drink the rain...   

Dressing our words  
Seeing the dirt and flaws inside us hurts  
One final glass  
A sour taste from our promises  
I bid farewell and crawl out of my shell   

I'm awake!  
I see the mistakes I make  
Hiding wounds won't ease the pain  
Sleep won't make you whole again  
Change the inside...   

Today I found a seed of sorrow  
The harvest leaves a soil of shame  
Now I undress and face tomorrow  
And brave I walk to meet the blame   

I'll search my home outside these borders  
I'll run to meet up with the past  
A Resolution for the New Life  
This time I know it's gonna last   

And I will...
Change the inside  
Drink the rain  
Open my wounds to heal the pain   

Learn the work of The Machine...

[II: Spirit of Man]
