[japanese bonus track]

[Music and Lyrics by D.Gildenlow]

The Timeweaver's abode is deep under ground 
As interweaving history he us creates 
He weaves in eternity not to be found 
The Elder's legend that braids our fates 

Hoary and hollow-eyed, older than sun 
Abiding his destiny to reverberate time 
There's no one to remember how it began 
In rooms filled with candles he reverberates time 

Timeweaver, tell me my history that I've been searching so 
Timeweaver, reveal the mystery that I've been letting grow 

He once was given his mission by three... 
The Holy, The Sacred and The Ancient Dream 
He doesn't exist for those who don't believe 
He's nothing but stories for those who don't deem 

Hoary and hollow-eyed, older than sun 
Abiding his destiny to reverberate time 
There's no one to remember how it began 
In rooms filled with candles he reverberates time 

Timeweaver, tell me my history that I've been searching so 
Timeweaver, reveal the mystery that I've been letting grow 

Spider's webs decorate dusty shelves lightened by old candles glow 
Ancient prescriptions from times that don't even exist 
In memories 

[D.Gildenlow/Both/D.Gildenlow/Hallgren]

Guarded by spells he reincarnates time 
Gives birth once again to a century's child 

Hoary and hollow-eyed, older than sun 
Abiding his destiny to reverberate time 
And now I can remember how it began 
In rooms filled with candles I reverberate time 

Timeweaver told me a history I didn't want to know 
Timeweaver revealed the mystery - two became one to grow! 

Timeweaver... 
...time...will...be...here...now...and...

Now!
