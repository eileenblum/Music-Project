[Music: D.Gildenlow]

Karachay: This lake in Kyshtym has swallowed nuclear waste for almost fifty
years now. Radiation was earlier so high that one hour at the shore of this
lake would cause death in just a few weeks. Karachay, the entire lake, is
now covered with concrete...

Don't disturb me now  
I can see the why, the when and how  
Looking back to see all bridges burn  
I have reached the point of no return  
this is zero  
(Shore Serenity)    
This is all that is left of me:  
A broken man at a broken sea   

To be or not to be a wheel in the big machinery  
That is not the matter of the game  
Just as long as you can sense the frame of the big picture  
(Wheels make The Machine)    

This is all that is left of me  
a broken man at a concrete sea  
But now I know that one cell can kill  
and a big Machine stands and falls with... a wheel...
