[Music: D.Gildenlow]

'They tell all the people of Europe, it's a good, clean industry, it's a
great way to save the world. But I'm here to tell you that now they're
knocking on our door because they can't find any place to store the damned
stuff for eternity, They come to our homeland and they want to lease some
land for 10,000 years!'  

This was our home - we had our truth  
Bled for our creed - why must we still bleed?  
Your tailings are bound forever in this ground...   
So you come for our holy ground  
When your nature's gone and your house has burnt down  
No!   

For hundreds of years you've hurt this land  
Eating what's there, leaving a wasteland  
But there are no space to hold all your mistakes   

Still you come for our holy ground  
When your nature's gone and your houses are all burnt down  

[instrumental]

[Hallgren]

'To this day, they will not return our sacred land, even though their
highest hypocritical court said that we could and indeed did, own the 
Black Hills. I still continue to struggle for the eventuality of regaining that sacred land.'
