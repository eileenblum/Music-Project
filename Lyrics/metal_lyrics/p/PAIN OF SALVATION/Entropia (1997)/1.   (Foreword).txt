[music &amp; lyrics: Daniel Gildenlow]

Walk with me! There are worlds to see!
Listen to me now - you. Listen to me now - you.
Do my words mean more to hear when I am standing here?
On a stage like all your silly idols do!
Open up your eyes - all. Let your walls and grins fall.
Would you reach for something new, if the crowds were reaching too?
Are you close enough to taste their tears at all?

Your hate is but a worn-out lover, sick and sear.
"Rape me again!" you beg in pain, dear friend
"But hey - just don't stop!The stillness makes me scared"

Listen to my plain words.
That's all you'll get from me: words.
The rest is up to you; would you dare to let me through?
Are you brave enough to leave me in control?

...you're all afraid...

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid of you!
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid anymore - I am a shipwrecked swept ashore.

Life won't wash away your sins.
Life can't wash away your guilt.
Life will only make your conscience... wilt!

[Daniel Gildenlow]
[Daniel Magdic]

Somewhere a child just died; yet another victim for man's endless strife.

World could be better than this! There are so many ways to live (leave) a life...
Would you claim you live yours... right? Right?! No!
Take a stand! World is in your hand!

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid of you!
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid of you!
We're just the same me and you.
The same me and you (Walk with me!)
...I see myself in you...
