[lyrics: Daniel Gildenlow]

(Watching corners and crossing
Watching all the red lights
Watching the stress
Watching beggars and bankers and rushing cars
I'm drowning in this mess)

Help me! Rescue me! Save me! Set me free! (watching all the stress)

It is strange - among all people I feel alone.
Very strange - despite the sun I'm cold to the bone!
If this is progress let me out!

Up on the rooftops I feel alive - lovely detached from the human hive.
Up on the rooftops I feel so free.
Far from the city that's suffocating me.

(watching corners and crossings
Watching all the red lights
Watching the stress
Watching beggars and bankers and rushing cars
I'm drowning in this mess)

Is this what we want?

I believe: beneath the surface we turn to stone.
Can't you see? You meet your neighbors over the phone!
I'm awake - watch me! I'll escape - watch me!
If this is progress help me to regress!

Alone by the ocean I feel alive - lovely detached from the human hive.
Alone by the ocean I feel so free.
Far from the city that's suffocating me.

You live too shallow act too deep! Fail to sow but proudly reap!
...and you still need more!
Indians show us where you're from
Stress indicates what we'll all become!

In time you'll awake!
In time you'll escape!
In time you'll awake!
You'll see what's at stake!
Is this what we want? ...is this what we need?
