[music &amp; lyrics by: Daniel Gildenlow]

"I'm here now, by your side"
Sheltered from the cold, a soldier guards a boy.
Clocks are cutting as times pass by their pain
(bringing release through the book on his knees)
(keep trying, keep trying, keep dying inside)

"Hush now little child, it's time to say goodnight.
Find rest in my lullaby this night
I'll still be here when the nightmists draw near"
(blind figures controlling his life)
(keep falling, keep falling, keep falling down now)

"Have faith my son - reach for my hand and I'll walk with you till the sun goes down.
Follow me now, we will meet again in your land
(have faith my son)
Now I'll lead you home."

Opening stillness, reaching through illness. They walk in nightmist.
"Now, we meet again. I'm so close to you now. Again we laugh."

Where shallow waters reach for unknown mystic shores they gaze at the horizon and smile

[Daniel Gildenlow]

"Behold my son - reach for the vision that fills your mind, just let go and run.
Follow the path that was meant for you long ago.
(behold my son)
And cross the plains of dawn."

Wordless questions, tearful confessions.
They meet at last now, when it is time to go separate ways
(fading pages)
They have touched through ages.

"Remember me my son, it's time to say... goodbye.
I'll free you from your prison - now go!
You're free now, the wave meets the shore!"
(keep running, keep running, keep running home kid)
(winning a war made him lose evermore)

"Farewell my son - the tubes that were straining you to a death within life are gone.
Wait for us, I and your mother will cherish you my son.
I cry as I'm watching you run across plains of dawn."

...and so through that evening a soldier is leaving his son once again and a war has been lost...
Forlorn he is reeling, unmendably kneeling.
But fate leaves no choice: now he must close the book!
