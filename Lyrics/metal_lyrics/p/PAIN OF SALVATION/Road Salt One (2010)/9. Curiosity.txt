Your love is beautiful.
Your love is sensual.
My love will puncture your skin.
My love goes all he way in.

Your love is poetry.
My love is sodomy.
Your love is everything.
My love is anything.

We believe it's personality, but really it's sexuality.
We put faith in love and honesty, but the stuff that makes our history and sets
us free is curiosity,
Curiosity.
Curiosity.
Curiosity.

My love is physical.
A shameless animal.
One with all riding the wave.
A childish lust feeling it's way.

We pretend it's personality, but it's really sexuality.
We put faith in love and honesty, but the stuff that makes our history and sets
us free is curiosity,
Curiosity.
Curiosity.
Curiosity.

You say love's divine.
(My love if beautiful)
Well baby, so is mine.
(My love if beautiful)
See, the only time I hear you take the name of the Lord
(Your love will puncture my skin)
Is when you're tied to the bed with your face against the head board.
(My love is beautiful
Your love will puncture my skin
We believe it's personality)
So, do you take it in vain?
And why would you take it again and again?

We pretend it's personality, but it's really sexuality.
We put faith in love and honesty, but the stuff that makes our history and sets us free is.
Curiosity.
