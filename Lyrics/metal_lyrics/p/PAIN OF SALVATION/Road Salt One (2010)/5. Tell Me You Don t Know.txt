There's a me who always found his way,
But I can't seem to find him just today.

If sometimes I ask you where to go,
Just don't help me find the road,
Tell me you don't know,
Please tell me so.

There was a me who always knew what was right -
That's who I need to help me through this night.

So, if sometimes I ask you where to go,
Please don't help me find the road,
Tell me you don't know,
Please tell me you don't know.

If sometimes I ask you where to go,
Just don't help me find the road,
Tell me you don't know.

If sometimes I ask you where to go,
Please don't help me find the road,
Tell me you don't know,
Tell me you don't know.
No, no, no..
