She likes to hide.
She likes to hide.
She likes to hide, and I don't know why.
I'd ask but she's too hard to find.
She likes to hide.

This Tuesday I almost tried to ask her why
But she got that look in her eyes.
She likes to hide.
She likes to hide.

Last night I asked her why, and first she smiled,
But then she just broke down and cried.
She likes to hide.
She likes to hide.

She told me that she'll be fine, and she's all mine,
But I'm pretty sure that she lied.
See, she likes to hide.

She plays this game where I'm supposed to find out the reason why she likes to hide.
She plays that game each night.
I fail to find out, 'cause I am where I like to hide,
I am where I like to hide,
I am where I like to hide,
I am where I like to hide.
