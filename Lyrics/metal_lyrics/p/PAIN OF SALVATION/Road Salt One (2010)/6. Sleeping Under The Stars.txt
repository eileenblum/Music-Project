Wait darling wait, for the sound of electric guitars.
Wait darling wait, you will soon be in bed with the stars.

Wait darling wait, and don't worry 'cause you will see,
Semen stains wash out surprisingly easily,
From leather back-seats of expensive cars,
And soiled toilet seats in the bars.

But why worry about emotional scars,
When tonight you'll be sleeping under the stars.

Wait darling wait, and don't worry 'cause you will see,
Semen stains wash out surprisingly easily,
From leather back-seats of expensive cars,
And soiled toilet seats in the bars.

But why worry about emotional scars,
When tonight you'll be sleeping under the.. Stars.

Wait darling wait, for the moment he catches your eyes.
Wait darling wait, "You're the shit" as they say in.
As they say at.
Wherever
they say that.

And don't worry about emotional scars,
'cause tonight you'll be sleeping under the...
Stars.
