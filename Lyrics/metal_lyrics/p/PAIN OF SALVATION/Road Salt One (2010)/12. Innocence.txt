Once there was a me who always knew the way,
Who somewhere on the road led me astray.

And I've seen so many souls,
(Always thought I'd change somehow, altered by the road)
Broken in despair,
(And become what I was always meant to be)
Lying at the curb,
(But every step along the way, every mile of road)
Gasping for air.
(Wore down the fearless manchild that was me)

Restless mind, you steal my mind.
Need to find a place to hide.

Slowly losing my innocence.
Slowly losing my.
Slowly losing my.

Once there was a me who always knew what was right,
But somewhere on this road he lost his light.

Always thought I'd be much more,
(Never thought I'd be this weak. Never thought I'd fall)
I would transform,
(And lose myself along these dusty roads)
Somehow, someday,
But here I am.

Reckless time, you steal my mind.
Need to hide each place I've found.

Still I'm losing my innocence.
I'm still losing my innocence.

We're all losing our innocence.
I want that invincible time, that invincible me.
I want it all back.
I want it all back.
I want myself back.
