[limited edition digipak bonus track]

I don't know what she means to me, I don't know why she moves me.
I don't know where she needs to be, but it is not here beside me.
I don't know what she means to me, I don't know why she moves me.
I don't know why she's not with me, I just know that it kills me.
I don't know what she means to me, I don't know why she moves me.
And I don't know where I need to be, but it is not here inside her!
