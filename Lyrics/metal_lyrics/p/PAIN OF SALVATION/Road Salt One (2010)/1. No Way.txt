There is no way that you can love her like I do.
Oh no, there is no way - I see through you.
'Cause when I hold her in the night,
All that is wrong will become right.
And I know that she feels it, too,
'Cause no-one loves her like I do.

There is no way that you could know her like I do.
Oh no, there is now way you'll ever do.
She is a flower of the wild,
Oh, and I have seen her from her darkest side.
She is a twisted little ride,
And you will never know her like I do.

But still I'm crying, feels like bleeding from two self-inflicted wounds.
Young and helpless, treading water in a cesspool of maroon.
Feels like dying, feels like dying... But I'll live!
But I'll live!
But I'll live!
But I'll live!

There is now way that you could touch her like I do.
Oh no, she thinks of me when she's with you.
She wants it gently like a child,
But play her right and she goes wild.
But one step wrong and she will hide.
And you will never touch her like I do.

There is now way that you can fuck her like I can.
Oh no, you're simply not that kind of man.
'Cause sometime when she's screaming no,
She really wants for you to go, go, go.
But you can never ask her why,
No, then she will close up and deny.

But still I'm bleeding this old road salt from my self-inflicted eyes.
Slowly scarring and corroding, to thaw this young heart of ice.
And I'm kneeling, yes I'm kneeling... But I'll live!
But I'll live!
But I'll live!
But I'll live!

I can see how you would need her to spice up your grind.
I can see why she moves you - knocks you out of orbit and mind.
And I can see how you need her to save you from yourself.
Unmeshing you from your grid, to dust you off on your shelf.

But I can't see why she needs you.
No.
I can't see that at all.
You'd have something that I don't?
Would that be possible?
Would that be possible?
Would that be possible?
Would that be possible?
