If you wait
If I could ask you to wait
I'd get back, somehow
To you

If I could ask you to wait
I'll bring myself
Home to you

I would walk on this road
Through mud, through grass, through dust, through rain
Whatever I find in my way
I'll power through
I'llPower through
Home to you
If you wait
If I could ask you to wait
But I can't ask you to wait

Though it breaks me:
Go
I must ask you to go
Go
I must ask you to go
Please go
(I must ask you to go)
