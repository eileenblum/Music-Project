Yellow raven sipped the air
Of thunder and of rain
Yellow raven sipped the air
Gentle eyes kissing the rain

Where do you go fantastic dreambird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from here
Where do you go fantastic dreambird?
Take me away somewhere
Take me away from here

Oh, Take me away

The thunderbird began to cry
The music died away
The thunder bird began to cry
And smoke was slowly drifting by

Where do you go fantastic dreambird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from here
Where do you go fantastic dreambird?
Take me away somewhere
Take me away from here

Yellow raven your heart's flying
But your love is killing me...
