You are all defining me
Like you know me inside out
And if I let it get to me
You'd damage me beyond repair

And I have always done my best
To block it out and keep myself
But lately it has been so hard
And I don't know where I end and you start

These are the words that I have bled
These are the tears that I have shed
These are the bleak roads that I dread
This is the home which they led

Can you hear me now?
Can you see me now?
Can you touch me now?

Deep inside I'm gone
Deep inside I'm gone
Deep inside I'm gone
Deep inside I'm gone

And I have given more than most
I've fucking overdosed on honesty
But then when I've given everything
Then what will there be left of me?

And who'll stand by this troubled man
With a burning mind and a fever inside?
See, if I cannot direct this flame
It might just burn everything in its way

These are the words that I have bled
These are the tears that I have shed
These are the bleak roads that I dread
This is the home which they led

Can you hear me now?
Can you see me now?
Can you touch me now?

Deep inside I'm gone
Deep inside I'm gone
Deep inside I'm gone
Deep inside I'm gone --

I just never seem to be enough
You're too many mouths to feed
Too many reached out hands to hold
Too many broken hearts to heal
And in the end, I'll spread too thin
And gently over-bleed
Sadly overestimating
The amount of me

I let you crawl into my head
I let you crawl under my skin
I let you taste every tear I've shed
I'm always letting you right in --

So crawl over the words I've bled
I'm not really there
Undress and crawl into my bed
I'm not really there
I'm gone
Oh yeah...
You see, deep inside I'm gone
