I watched you die
Though you had always been there
Since I first came into this world
Outside people smile
I ask - why this deep blue sky?
When you have left this world today
Does it not know when to weep?

All my life I've looked up to you
A humble old man who always knew
No one can ever be closer to God than you
So who could fill this void

I still can't believe that you are not around
That your warm voice won't make another sound
Sure I understand, but I never will accept
That you should be gone

I watched you die
And I have feared this moment
Since I was just a child
So why that sunny sky?
When my beloved grandfather
Lies dead here cold and still?
