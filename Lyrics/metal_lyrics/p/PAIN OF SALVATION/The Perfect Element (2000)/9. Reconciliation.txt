I thought I'd seen hell
Thought I knew it all
Now I know too well
Hell is to wake up
But it makes all the difference

Tasting the tears in my mouth
Taking the weight on my shoulders
The hours and days of your life
Don't necessarily make you older

I'm sick of running away
Along these bloody streets
I'm sick of predators and prey
Of being everybody's end!

I've washed my hands of your blood
Thought it would leave me clean
But with time on my hands
It turned to mud forming this crust of sin

Now - to be truly free
I'll let it come to me
So -break me if you must
When you break this crust
Freedom is to see

Hear this voice, see this man
Standing before you I'm just a child
Just a man learning to yield

I hate these hands soaked in blood
I hate what these eyes have seen
Up to my knees in filth and mud
How it hurts to become clean

I was always on my mind
But never on my side
Run - but if you run away
You'll always have to hide
So if you need to run
Run for help!
