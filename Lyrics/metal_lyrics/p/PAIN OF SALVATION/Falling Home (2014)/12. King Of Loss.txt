[Limited Edition Digipack Track]Mother
At my first breath
Every paragraph was set
As I inhaled the scent of debt

Mother
That first stolen air
Taken as a legal sign
On papers saying I'm not mine

"We crown you, the King of Loss
Better get on your feet
Best be one of us
Better get yourself on the list for success
Dress up as a State investment
Charm the press
A breed from the seed
Of only one short breath"

Mother
Hence we cry:
Some of us are free to stand
Most of us are bound to lie

In those bloodstained beds
No one can afford to pay
The prices on their babies' heads

I am the King of Loss!
For every dear smile
I feel I'm not one of us
I have been waiting here
In the line for success
Dressed up as a state investment
I charm the press
Then tell me that life means more
Than this vain thirst

"One more governmental blade
Now drawn from its private sheath
Quite a bargain I'd say since either way
You will live by the show of our teeth!"

I hold up my head
This was my life
Now I'm with the dead
So I lay my bare neck
This is your call
Dub a king or cut a wreck

Mother
Mother
Is this all I am?
Is this all I'll be?
This is not enough

Mother
I wish that we could talk
