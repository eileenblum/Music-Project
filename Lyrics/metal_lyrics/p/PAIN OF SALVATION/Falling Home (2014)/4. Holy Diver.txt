[originally by Dio]Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver

That's right
You're Holy, Holy Diver

C'mon

Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'til you see the light
Oh, we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away, get away
Gotta get away, get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel

Holy Diver
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
That's right
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
