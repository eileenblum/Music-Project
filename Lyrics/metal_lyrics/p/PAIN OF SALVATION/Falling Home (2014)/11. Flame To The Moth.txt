I long for the summer
I long for the sun gently touching my face
I'll open my eyes, let it burn every splinter
Unleash desert storms on its way to my heart

I had this coming
Every day of my life
This is where I stop fighting,
Eyes open wide

I once had blue eyes
Hungry and wise
Now they are black from this dark age of lies
We're all privatized
Industrialized
We capitalize on the beams in our eyes

It's all in the eyes

Eyes tearing with sorrow
Burning with anger and passion and lust
The swift wind of thought
Of wildness and laughter
The soil of defiance
The firm ground of trust

(we had this coming every day of our lives)
(we should start fighting for eyes open wide)

But I am put here, in this world gone insane
Where everything's for sale
From nature, over stars down to DNA
Then I can gladly say
That I'd be the first to break that norm
Any day, any way
And the last to join the ranks
To hunt down the Daily Threat
Or any other brand of prey

We once had blue eyes probing the skies
Now they are blackened from this modern life
All privatized,
Industrialized
A failure offensive and sore to the eye

From this dark age of treason
We all know how to cry
Then we learn how to smile, how to smile
We all tell you the truth
Tell us the truth!
Then we learn how to lie
And oh, how we lie
Now we lie

When you bow your heads tomorrow
At the world we build today
I want you to remember
That I stood my ground and said no
Say no!
I said no...
Say no!
I said no...
Say no!
I said no...
Say no!
Say no!
Say no!
