She keeps the world at bay
With walls built to stand come-what-may
And with that coldness on display, they held until today
She would hold her own
Running all alone
Ridding her road of every grain to stay in control

Suddenly she is down on all four
And the walls will support her no more
Cries her eyes out like never before
Onto this linoleum
The bottled up and stored

She's won every war
And when she's out that door
She will push ahead of you, frowning at the poor
She would move so fast not to end up last
Aiming for the finish line to smile at those she'd passed

Suddenly she is down on all four
And the walls will support her no more
Cries her eyes out like never before
Onto this linoleum
The bottled up and stored
And stored
The bottled up and stored

Sometimes, ooh, just sometimes
That's really all it takes:
A hand on her shoulder
Then she breaks

Sometimes that's really all it takes:
(Yes then)
A word of kindness and she breaks
(She breaks)
And then the sum of damage done
(Well she breaks)
Spills out on stale linoleum
(She breaks)

Sometimes that's really all it takes:
(She breaks)
A gentle touch and then she breaks
(She breaks)
To see the sum of damage done
(She breaks)
Stain this linoleum
(Oh, she breaks)

Sometimes that's really all it takes:
(Oh, she breaks)
A word or touch and then we break
(Oh, she breaks)
And all this world's linoleum
(She breaks)
Can't hold the sum of damage done

She's becoming her last casualty
If she breaks then at last she'll be free
But she keeps it together once more
To run another day to fight another war

Itsy bitsy spider
Climbed the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Now she stays on the ground
So she'll never fall
See she would rather drown than lose control
