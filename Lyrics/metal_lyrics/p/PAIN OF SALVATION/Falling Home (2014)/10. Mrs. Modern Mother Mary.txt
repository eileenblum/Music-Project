(We'll cut you down to size)
There is a woman burning at the center square
Raven black eyes and long let out hair
Screaming, while cloaked vultures holier-than-thou circle and glare
At sweat drops on pale skin like satin
And as the raging flames work her into cinder
Said in their defence:
Stupidity and ignorance,
Prejudice and intolerance
All sound so much wiser when dressed up in Latin

Life will never be the same
I have a bigger world since I found God (I found God)
Truth will never be the same
I'm in a righter mind since I found God (I found God)

I found Mrs Modern Mother Mary, all pale and weary
From raising her overweight kids in the outskirts of Suburbia
On a nice Christian gender based salary
And a church she can merely attend
And there on the flip-side of Caucasia we see
Miss Modern Mary Magdalene gone Deep Throat on international cable TV

So you keep talking about progress and equality
But to me the crusade is still on, my friend

Silly me who always thought
Life was for the living
And giving in to lust
Was all to give and to be given

Life will never be the same
I have a better view since I found God (I found God)
Guilt will never be the same
I'm on a higher ground since I found God (I found God)
I found God...
I found God...

Life will never be the same
I have a better view now
There's always someone else to blame
I'm on the winning team now

Death will never be the same
I'm in the faster lane now
No more am I the one to blame
I have a juster cause now

Love will never be the same
Lust will never be the same
Shame will never be the same
I will never be the same
And you will never be the same
