[Music: Daniel Gildenlow / Daniel Magdic, lyrics: Daniel Gildenlow]

(Watching corners and crossings
Watching all the red lights
Watching the stress
Watching beggars and bankers and rushing cars
I'm drowning in this mess)

Help me! Rescue me! Save me! Set me free!

It is strange - among all people I feel alone.
Very strange - despite the sun I'm cold to the bone!

Up on the rooftops I feel alive
Lovely detached from the human hive.
Up on the rooftops I feel so free.
Far from the city that's suffocating me.

Is this what we want?

I believe: beneath the surface we turn to stone.
Can't you see?
We meet our neighbours over the phone
I'm awake - watch me! I'll escape - watch me!
If this is progress help me to regress!

Alone by the ocean I feel alive
Lovely detached from the human hive.
Alone by the ocean I feel so free.
Far from the city that's suffocating me.

You live too shallow, act too deep!
Fail to sow but proudly reap!

Alright

...and you still need more!
Indians show us where we're from
Stress indicates what we've all become!

(Watching corners and crossings
Watching all the red lights
Watching the stress
Watching beggars and bankers and rushing cars
I'm drowning in this mess)

In time you'll awake!
In time you'll escape!
In time you'll awake!
You'll see what's at stake!

Is this what we want?
Is this what we need?
Well
Is it?
Is it?
Is it?
Guess it is
No?
Is it?

(Watching corners and crossings
Watching all the red lights
Watching the stress)
