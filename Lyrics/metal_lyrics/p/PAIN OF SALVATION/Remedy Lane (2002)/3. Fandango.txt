Watch them dance...

She is intimacy - a wonder of closeness
Fighting hypocrisy - a lonely child that
Never could believe, yet never give up
On life's insanity
Understanding is all, she fails to find it
She can never fall

All her life she's longed to be weak
All this time on roads turning bleak
Watch her dance...

He is sharpness of mind - a lonely Peter Pan
Always standing behind and from a distance
Looking at a world of love and deceit

This child of air defies every rooftop and tree
Instead of what he's craving for the most
Getting close!

Live that you might find the answers
You can't know before you live

Love and life will give you chances
From your flaws learn to forgive

All his life he's sought to be brave
All this time sought someone to save
Watch him dance...

They are two of a kind
Two children warm and wild
In a world going blind they raise their voices
Speaking for the mute
Building dreams of love finding their way through it
They are turned into myths - a beacon of hope

Live that you might find the answers
You can't know before you live
Love and life will give you chances
From your flaws learn to forgive

ALL HIS (life) HE WAS (just) WISHING
(to) BE TOUCHED (but) TOO SCARED (of)
WHAT HE (de)SIRED
(while) ALL HER (life) SHE WAS (an) OBJECT
(of) GROWN MEN'S (de)SIRE (and) WISHED TO
(be) UNTOUCHED
(now) THEY MUST (try) TO WORK (their)
UNFORGOTTEN sexuality OUT!

Watch them dance...

Always being much more human than they wished to be

They built up a world so wonderful
So pure and tense
Stained only now and then by the blood
Of their young innocence...

All their life on Tolkien's grounds
All their time on islands unfound

Trapped in a Fandango

Watch them dance!
Fandango!

Live that you might find the answers
You can't wait before you live
Love and life will give you chances
From your flaws learn to forgive...
