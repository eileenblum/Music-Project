And so I find myself here once again - first step down Remedy Lane
Budapest you tore my world apart - well, here I am
Worn with rope ends on my mind, torn with blood scarred in my eyes
But now I'm back to shake that from my life

to be honest I don't know what I'm looking for - who to be

blind, just finding rest from my mind here in Budapest?
confusing zest with the joy of being blessed with the bliss of self-escape as we kiss?
and mixing my being unstressed with your being undressed and the taste of being true
with the fresh taste of me and you as we touch? I don't know
but I saw so much of me in you, the me I've missed, the young and free in you
but still, that doesn't mean a thing, may not mean anything about my needing you
but I guess we had to meet, to be near; to make sure, and still my dear
beyond this bed and that door, to be honest, I fear I just don't know

to be honest I don't know what I'm looking for...
lying here, watching you leave through that door
