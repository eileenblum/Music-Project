Ticking... Ticking... Wishing... wishing...
Standing here in Buda trying to explain
To myself and to the girl beside
Why I feel so weightless and free from all my pain
Telling yourself that you're here inside
For the wind is in my hair as we are on this sun hot roof
And far below the Danube passes as we talk
And I'd like to think that this is what you wanted me to find
This happiness could help us rebuild what we've lost

Calling - Waking every god
Falling - Love is in my blood
Breathing - love is life unbound
Kneeling - let me tread its ground
Through her eyes I can see who you used to be
Through my eyes she can see
What that feeling means to me

Oh, ticking...
Wishing I was stronger - wishing I was whole
Wishing I was someone that I'm not
And I wish that I could linger to the faith I used to have
Wishing of myself to be a god
I'm wishing to be a god!

[Daniel Gildenlow]
[Johan Halgren]

Calling - waking every god
Falling - love is in my blood
Breathing - love is life unbound
Kneeling - let me tread its ground
Through her eyes I can see who I used to be
Through my eyes she can see
Numb anxiety!

Love take me home
Life shake me home!
