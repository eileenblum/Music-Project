I long for the summer
I long for the sun, gently touching my face
I'll open my eyes, let it burn every splinter
Unleash desert storms on its way to my heart

And I had this coming every day of my life
This is where I stop fighting, eyes open wide

You took this blade and cut a wreck
And in one blow laid bare your neck
Where did we go wrong?

I once had blue eyes, hungry and wise
Now they are black from this dark age of lies
We're all privatized, industrialized
We capitalize on the beams in our eyes
It's all in the eyes

Eyes - tearing with sorrow
Burning with anger and passion and lust
The swift wind of thought
Of wildness and laughter
The soil of defiance
The firm ground of trust

(we had this coming - every day of our lives)
(we should start fighting for eyes open wide)

But I am put here, in this world gone insane
Where everything's for sale
From nature, over stars down to DNA
Then I can gladly say
That I'd be the first to break that norm
Any day, any way
And the last to join the ranks
To hunt down the Daily Threat
Or any other brand of prey

You took this blade and cut a wreck
And in one blow laid bare your neck
Where did we go wrong?

We once had blue eyes, probing the skies
Now they are blackened from this modern life
All privatized, industrialized - a failure
Offensive and sore to the eye

One small step for man
Maybe this time I'll fly
And if I hit the ground, it's the way we all die
We are wrecks of the cut
Soups of the season
With dollar sign scars
From this dark age of treason

We all know how to cry
Then we learn how to smile
How to smile
We're all telling the truth
Tell us the truth!
Then we learn how to lie
And oh, how we lie
Now we lie

When you bow your heads tomorrow
At the world we build today
I want you to remember
That I stood my ground and said no (say no)
I said no...
Say no!
