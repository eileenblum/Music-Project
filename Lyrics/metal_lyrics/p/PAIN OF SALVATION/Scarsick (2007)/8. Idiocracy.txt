Silence
Cold skin
Black mind
Blue light
Broken
Shut down
Knuckles
All white

Babel
Cold fact
Core mine
Black gold
Failure
Lockdown
Gun-hands
All sold

We're waiting, so close your eyes
Relax and take a deep breath now
Believe the lies
When you wake up you'll be democratized

Violence
Cold pin
Blood crust
Blinded
Damp sheets
Needles
Stale smiles
Sick bed

Guiltknife
Scarsoil
Sinstain
Killchrome
Footbare
Gone wrong
Blue lights
Bring me home

We're waiting, so close your eyes
Relax and take a deep breath now
Believe the lies
When you wake up we'll all seem nice
So close your eyes
Just take another deep breath now
And fantasize
Pretend the world we're forming
Is a paradise

Why can't I close my eyes?
Why can't I just be hypnotized,
Industrialized and privatized?
All mesmerized

'Cause I can see
And what I see around me makes me paralyzed
Yes I can see
And what I see is not worthy a democracy
It's uncivilized
So please close my eyes
I don't want to see this undemocratic,
semi-automatic mediocracy and hypocracy
Pretending we're free
Under plastic flags waving dependency
For this idiocracy

Close my eyes...
