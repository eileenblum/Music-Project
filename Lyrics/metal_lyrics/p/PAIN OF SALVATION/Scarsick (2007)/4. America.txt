You brought us the a-bomb in so many ways
Endorsed by God and The Book
So God loves a war monger?
Hey Mr. Blix: forget Iraq and the time it took
'Cause I know just where to look

"Could we have a vote please?"

They came with a song - America
They wouldn't stay long - America
We are America
God bless America
God bless America and Capitol Hill
'Cause no one else will

So now you are scared
The Arabs will kill for their god
Like you do for yours?
Protect your obesity with your life man
Hey - Angry God or Diet Coke?
Who cares it's all a joke

"Heil homo pecuniae"

Saving us yet another time
Earning a buck on every dime
Sick of America
Sick of America
Sick of America and Capitol Hill
Moving in for the next kill

Did you say "I love you"?

A simpler democracy
Where every flaw and failure is called a "Right"
A new form of freedom
Based on your income, your color, creed
And your choice of gun
But it provides great fun

"Dr. Phil or Oprah?"
"Letterman or Leno?"
"Idol or Big Brother?"

(we'll be back after this short break)

It could have been good America
It could have been great America
Land of the brave and free
Welcoming you and me
But this Brave New World is not as new anymore
Each day a new store
Each year a new war
While chosen whites rule the poor

...in America

Oh, America
Don't you walk out on me?
Just wait a second now
Please hear me now
Oh... I'll do my best to love you
Oh yes I will
I know you're out there
C'mon
Raise your voices
Don't let them ruin your reputation
Don't let them wreck your constitution
Not out of fear
Not out of greed

But you had a good run America
Your day in the sun America
Hello British Empire
Hello Roman Empire
Hello Soviet
There is a new kid in town
Joining the gone down
Finding what you found
Treading your worn - worn down ground

Rise to your former glory
Be brave and warm
Oh America

If I say I love you
If I say I love you
If I say I love you
Dare you love me too?
