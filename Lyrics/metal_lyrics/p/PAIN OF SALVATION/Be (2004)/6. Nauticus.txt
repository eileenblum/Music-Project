[drifting]

Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Won't you hear a sinner's prayer
Oh Lord

Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Won't you help me find the way
When I'm lost and lead astray
Oh Lord

Mmm...

Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Won't you help me to stay humble
Oh Lord

Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Won't you help me be an ocean
Help me bend to stay unbroken
Oh Lord

Mmm...

Save me, I'm drifting
H elp me, I'm drifting

Oh Lord...
Oh Lord...
Oh Lord

[Mr.Money:]
- OK alright baby, the love of my life

[Girl:]
- Are you referring to me... or the car?

- Now, Cindy...

[Girl:]
- Sandra

[Mr Money:]
- Yeah, of course. Now, as I see it, we've got two natural choices
here. So, what do you say? Either I drive and you can give me some
good head while I'm watching the road...

[Girl:]
- What?

[Mr. Money:]
- Well, somebody's gotta watch the road honey...
- ...or... YOU can drive this baby
- ...oh, but only if you're good at handling the stick of course...

[Girl:]
- But... this is an automatic?

[Mr. Money:]
- ...rrrright!

[Girl:]
- Is that some sort of sick joke?

[Mr. Money:]
- What?

[Girl:]
- ... "natural choices" my ass!

[Mr. Money:]
- Well, that's a third choise I didn't think about...

[Girl:]
- You son of a...!

[Mr. Money:]
- Take it easy baby!
- No sweat... it was only a joke, alright?

[Girl:]
- Alright

[Mr. Money:]
- ... I mean, of COURSE I was joking...
- ... I would NEVER let you drive my car!
