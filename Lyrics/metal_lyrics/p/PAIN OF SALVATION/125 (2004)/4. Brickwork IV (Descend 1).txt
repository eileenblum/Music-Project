( Music &amp; lyrics by Daniel Gildenlow)

(we were too weak protest or to care)
our ugly lies will outnumber us by far
your beautiful dreams
you must close tour eyes

(you'll pay in soul for the cutting of our loss)
will your eyes be mine the day when you regret
when you pay our debts to recover life
to recover life...
