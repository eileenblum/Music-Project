[Lyrics by D. Gildenlow]

Once there was a world out on these fields
that was untouched
Grateful for its love we thanked the earth that gave so much
And oh, I loved it so!
Once there was a pair of eyes
unbroken just like my heart.
Belonging to a father and his son
now torn apart
And oh, I loved him so!

"Why, mommy?
Tell me why daddy is walking away
leaving me!"

I remember birds of pray
dark shadows piercing the ground!
Faceless men came shouting
about a pride to which we were bound
And oh, I searched for him so!
"Faith darling, have faith my son!
Your daddy is winning a war..."

"...for you!"

Daddy need me, love and lead me
Your superseding war won't feed me!

Watch fathers and sons
pale cling to their guns
Marching line by line
leaving reason behind
Their eyes now tensed with fear;
enemies are near
But all armies are
only fathers and sons...

Earth bleeding through their proceeding
All greedy vultures are needing

WAR! WAR! Dad - who is winning a war?
And dad - who is it for?
I won't shed a tear - I won't show no fear!
Won't disappoint you dad
(all greedy voltures need war)
I WON'T MISS YOU DAD!

Daddy need me, love and lead me
Your superseding war won't feed me
Daddy need me, love and lead me
Your superseding war won't feed me
