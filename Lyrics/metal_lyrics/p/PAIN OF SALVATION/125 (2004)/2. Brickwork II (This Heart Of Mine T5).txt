[Music &amp; lyrics by D. Gildenlow]

[Hermansson]

I lie awake watching your shoulders
Move so softly as you breathe
With every breath you're growing older

But that is fine if you're with me

I pledge to wake you with a smile
I pledge to hold you when you cry
I pledge to love you till I die
Till I die:

[Hermansson]

The rays of dawn play on your eyelids
A sleeping beauty dressed in sun
This bed is all, this room eternal
A world persisting when we're long since gone

I will wake you with a smile
I will hold yo when you cry
I will love you till I die
Till I die
