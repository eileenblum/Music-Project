[Music &amp; lyrics by D. Gildenlow]

walk with me
and see the world I see
it is our home
it's where we all belong

life is flair
a brittle dress we wear
a fleeting sigh

but though pointless it may seem:
live as death were but a dream

you don't have to walk their way
you don't have to watch the show
you don't have to play their game
and you don't have to die to leave entropia

[Hermansson]

all remains:
forgotten smiles in frames
two fleeting lives cut down to pocket-size

walk with me
and change the world we see
we'll cease to be
just people passing by
home is where we all get by

you don't have to cry for more
you don't have to have it all
you don't have to win a war
if death is but a dream
then don't let me...

...fall asleep
