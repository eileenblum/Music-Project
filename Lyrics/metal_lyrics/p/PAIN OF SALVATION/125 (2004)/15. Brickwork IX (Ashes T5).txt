[Music &amp; lyrics by D. Gildenlow]

You claim I don't know you, but I know you well
I read in those ash eyes we've been through hell
I've walked with the weakest just to feel strong
You've given your body just to belong

Let's burn together, let's burn together (baby)

his pain will never end
These scars will never mend

I taste your sorrow and you taste my pain
Drawn to each other for every stain
Licking the layers of soot from your skin
Your tears work my crust to let yourself in

Touching you harder, touching you harder now

As we walk through the ashes - I whisper your name
A taste of pain to cling to
As we walk through the ashes - You whisper my name
Who's the one with the sickest mind... now?

This pain will never end
Our s-s-s-scars will never mend
Cleansing sweat
We are just using each other, too depraved to stay alive
But too young to die
And we hurt - Thus we hurt

Scrubbing it harder
Too late to back out now
Scrubbing it even harder
We are just so darn broken baby!
[Scrubbing ad lib x2]

As we walk through the ashes - I whisper your name
A taste of pain to cling to
As we walk through the ashes - You whisper my name
Who's the one with the sickest mind now?

[D.Gildenlow]

This pain will never end
These scars will never mend
Damn this dirty bed
Damn this dirty head
