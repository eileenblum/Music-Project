[Music &amp; lyrics by D. Gildenlow]

day after day, nothing's changed you're far away
but I want you to know I can't sleep anymore
by the nights
night after night the stars are shining so bright
though my pain is larger than Universe tonight

want you to know I can't sleep anymore
by the nights, by the nights
day after day I want you to say
that you're mine, you are mine

year after year, oh, tear after tear
it feels like my heart will break in two
you came like a wind, I couldn't defend
you cut my heart so deeply the scars won't mend
I'll never believe in love anymore, after this, after this
can never change or re-arrange what we lost, what we lost

[F. Hermansson]

time after time I am wasting my time
living in a past where I was strong
but now I am gone, I leave no shadow when I'm alone
I'll stay forever in my dreams where you are near

want you to know I can't sleep anymore
by the nights, by the nights
day after day I want you to say
that you're mine, you are mine
want you to know I can't sleep anymore
by the nights, by the nights
day after day I want you to say
that you're mine, you are mine
