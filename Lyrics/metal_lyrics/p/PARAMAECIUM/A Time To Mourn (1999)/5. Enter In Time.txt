[Music by A. Tompkins and I. Arkley]

From the outside all appeared serene
The garden framing a dreamlike scene
In the beginning the house was new
The rooms were warm there was much to do
I opened up the door and walked through
And maybe now I've come to see the light is whiter
And the life will enter in time
It's always whiter and the life is ever in time

Gravely the old man with greyish hair
Waiting sadly beneath the stair
Frail hands reaching out anew
Called for me, bid me thereinto (I hate myself)
I opened up the door and walked through
And maybe now I've come to see the light is whiter
And the life will enter in time
It's always whiter and the life is ever in time

All I have left is this memory
Thoughts of how loving used to be
All I have left is this tainted view
Painfully, I'm in love with you.
I open up the door and walk through
And maybe now I've come to see the light is whiter
And the life will enter in time
It's always whiter and the life is ever in time.
