[Music by A. Tompkins and I. Arkley]

The night becomes the day
The darkness is swept away
My life became the death
The pain was in my last spoken breath
They always rely
Too much on me
They hide and think I can't see
They offer up their lies
I see it lurking behind their eyes
I'm not to blame

The door has been left wide
They have been left to decide
It seems the more I gave
The less I got, the more that they crave
They always rely
Too much on me
They hide and think I can't see
They think it's all a game
And when it's done they call out my name
But I'm not to blame

I held the will to live
But I decided to give
In ways they could decry
But choose instead to watch as I die
They always rely
Too much on me
But they don't realise
They always rely
So much on me
That they don't realise
It's not up to me
