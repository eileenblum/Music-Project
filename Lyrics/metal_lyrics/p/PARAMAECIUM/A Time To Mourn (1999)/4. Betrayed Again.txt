[Music by A. Tompkins]

I have been betrayed again
All my rights have been denied
All my friends have turned me in
I have been betrayed by them

Even though I have done my all
Even tempered I've thought it through
Though in pain had the wherewithall
To suspect they were hurting too

In the night time I cry
In the night time I lie
In the night time I die
In the night time I cry that I have been betrayed

I have been betrayed again
Silent curses filled my mind
Terror waits, I can't condemn
(Though) I have been betrayed by them

Patient minded in certitude
That this anguish will over time
Take the remnants of servitude
To the heights of the near sublime

In the night time I cry
In the night time I lie
In the night time I die
In the night time I cry that I have been betrayed
