[Music by A. Tompkins and I. Arkley]

The light of morn pours through the window
To settle on pages torn
The book, so old, vainly the truth waits for
Someone to read but is untold
Time is running out for the answer is clearer now

Behind the ordinary lives something quite impure
A latent visionary sees that which can't endure
They take away the sadness, they take away the pain
They say she'll never have to think for herself again

Live for the day, live life the way you want to
Give what you may
But don't let them take life from you

Too young, too shy, but even her ancestors
Knew not when they would die
The sands of time slipping away
Whilst she meditates on her last crime
Time is running out for the answer is clearer now

Behind the ordinary lives something quite impure
Holy they masquerade and purport to hold the cure
They take away the sadness, they take away the pain
They say she'll never have to think for herself again

Live for the day, live and do what you want to
Give what you may
But don't let them take life from you
Live for the day, live life the way you want to
Give what you may
But don't let them take life from you

They're counting the sands of time
They're touching the sound of moonlight
They're sealing the book of life
They're taking the truth from time

Behind the ordinary lives something quite impure
The taste of innocence found
That taste which can't endure
They take away the sadness, they take away the pain
They say she'll never have to think for herself again

Live for the day, live and do what you want to
Give what you may
But don't let them take life from you
Live for the day, live life the way you want to
Give what you may
But don't let them take life from you
