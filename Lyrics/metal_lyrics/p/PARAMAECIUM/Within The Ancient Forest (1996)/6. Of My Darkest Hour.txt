[Music by A. Tompkins, C. Burton and J. Sherlock]

Lassitude overwhelming me, my consideration to relent once
more strengthened with time. But the pervasiveness of the
promise, "Thou shalt not be enticed beyond thy strength to
withstand," held firm and true in my heart; the foundation of truth,
beaten and lashed and covered over by the waves of uncertainty,
yet still unmoved and untouched.

"Stay with me," implored De-syr.

These, the final moments of my darkest hour serve to reinforce
my confidence in power. I overcome temptation but the dragon
threatens "For thine is the hour but mine is the day."

I fought long to leave the dark side for life is a moment and death
the eternity.

Far from the sky my soul is calling. Far from the sky my tear
drops falling. Vilified faces everywhere are turning their gazes
from the air. They relinquish their hearts without a care as they're
turning their faces. Far from the sky; my thoughts are waning. Far
from the sky my life is draining. Ever the nightfall kills the sun and
the stars are seducing everyone. They clamber to heed the
mindless ones as ever the night falls far.
