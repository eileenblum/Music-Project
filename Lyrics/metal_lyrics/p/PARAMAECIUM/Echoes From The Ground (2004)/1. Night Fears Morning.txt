Take it all away, I have walked alone
And wept in silent thought upon the cobblestone
They ridicule my faith, the learned of this rich establishment
I fear they hold the truth, that my beliefs are but imaginings
Night fears morning

My God, take it all away, all I have to say
Thoughts inside of me want to cease to be
This time they've gone too far, they've taken all my solemn dignity
This time they gone too far, they tore the veil, the pain goes on
Night fears morning

I must make my way to the holy lands
Aboard a merchant ship to search with my own hands
The soil will hold the keys to unlock all the bindings of my heart
My dreams will be assured, veracity will have its daylight
Life fears mourning
