[Music by A. Tompkins, J. De Ron and J. Sherlock]

The disciples, they were crucified, burned alive, decapitate
Those of the Reformation rejected the establishment of Rome
The likes of Luther at the diet of Worms
Others put to death in utter cruelty for failing to submit to a church of corruption
Denying transubstantiation|
But they overcame them by the blood of the Lamb
And the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death

That church, you think you're right all the time
You think you know what life means
Silence, see your crime, for things are seldom what they seem
As though to breathe were life
Darkness begins to rot your mind, putrefaction has left you blind
Your traditions and lies have left you less than whole
For what will it profit a man if he gains the world but loses his soul
