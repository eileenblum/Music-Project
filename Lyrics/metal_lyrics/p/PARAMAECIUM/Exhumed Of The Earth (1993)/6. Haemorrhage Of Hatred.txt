[Music by A. Tompkins, J. De Ron and J. Sherlock]

If prolonged hatred breeds it will devour your mind
Animosity will annihilate sobriety
Insalubrious emotions can extirpate your existence
Agonised respiration, immersion in hatred

Internal haemorrhage of hatred
Exudation of hatred from within
Internal haemorrhage of hatred
Spreading writhing mass of vermicular sin

Suppress the grudge preempting its maturity
Destroy the enmity even before its inception
Seek extrication from the doctrines of this world"
Attain the love from the shed blood of God's Right Hand

Internal haemorrhage of hatred
Exudation of hatred from within
Internal haemorrhage of hatred
Spreading writhing mass of vermicular sin

We are to follow the ways of Christ
Be ready to obey the preparation which God has set
Harbour nothing against your fellow man
Except the love from the shed blood of God's Right Hand
Of God's Right Hand
