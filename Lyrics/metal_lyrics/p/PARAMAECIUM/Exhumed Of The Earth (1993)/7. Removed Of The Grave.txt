[Music by J. De Ron, A. Tompkins and J. Sherlock]

Within the grave the body lies still beneath the soil
Aimless roots invade the casket as the body begins to spoil
Bereft of life, this rotting flesh, once nurtured in the womb
From uterine to pine it rots inside its silent tomb

Demon cry "With howls of laughter we saw them die
The life was ripped from them in days gone by
We watched the carcass go down, lowered into the ground
And we saw the dirt fall, now they lie there of no use to Him at all."
At the advent of the firstborn of the dead
The Spirit gives life to that which was mortal
Rent from the soil, exhumed of the earth
Life is restored when removed of the grave

Within the grave the body stirs as remains are realigned
The cadaver sown in weakness finds it can forsake the pine
Cervical meets thoracic as it claws its way through earth
Then the slab is rent asunder by a child of the rebirth
Demon cry "They're disinterred to seize the sky
Raised to life and thence to never die
We saw their eyes, they have power, their frailties are gone
We thought that we would have more time
Before they would be rent from the soil."
Exhumed of the earth, life is restored when removed of the grave
At the advent of the firstborn of the dead
The Spirit gives life to that which was mortal
Death has been devoured
