[Music by J. De Ron, J. Sherlock and A. Tompkins]

Darkness in the garden
The prayers of the Desired of Nations are spent
As the blood drips from His flesh
Treachery
The traitor's kiss of love was active malignity
As his hanging and disembowelment would testify
He had betrayed innocent blood

With torches and weapons
They came to take Him away
The High Priest's servant, Malchus, his ear severed
From his head by the sword of Cephas
Was healed instantly by the touch of Christ

They took Christ to Caiaphas, He went resigned to die
The death sentence wielding
Such was denied Sanhedrin
Pilate unyielding save to the political will

Clenching a mandate in one hand
Reluctance in the other
The latter of small consequence
With the former beholden

His wife was plagued by nightmares
Whilst he was haunted by
The nightmare of insurrection
The crowd outside was gathering
"Crucify" was the refrain
Of their liturgy of death

Pilate claimed innocence of this man's blood
Just before he sentenced Him to die in agony
They abused the boundaries
Of their temporal jurisdiction
Unbeknownst to them establishing
The eternal kingdom
