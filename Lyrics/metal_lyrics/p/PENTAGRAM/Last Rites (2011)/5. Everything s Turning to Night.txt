I thought you'd be the one 
The one who would always understand 
I'm a man 
But I've lost my bite 
Everything's turning to night 

Now only your fire can save my soul 
But I'm a liar, I'm a story half untold 
I still have my goals, but they are drifting far from sight 
Must you steal all of my rights 

Now I pray that someday you'll see 
How much I meant to you, and you to me 
It's becoming still, I fear I've lost my life 
Now my whole world is night 

I thought you'd be the one 
The one who would always understand 
I'm a man 
But I've lost my bite 
Everything's turning to night
