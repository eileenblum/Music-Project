A vigil watch he keeps, over the little ones he preys 
And taking every care, to draw them into his maze 
Their youth and innocence, blind their eyes to risk 
And with a bit of trust, he takes all that's forbid 

Once his lust has life, there'll be no stopping the pain 
From his mind to his hand, a short journey away 
With no perfection in lies, today his tep will slip 
And his best-laid plans , now vapor in the wind 

Let justice be done 
When the innocent's betrayed 
No child's life in vain 
vulture, walk your final mile today 

Guilt or innocence 
Death or life 
Curse or blessing 
Darkness or light 
A free will and a choice 
It's yours to decide 
And death in the first person 
Will be your last given right
