Horseman, take me away 
I got nobody today 
Try and get me away 
From this place 

Ride me through the storm 
My thoughts have not yet been born 
There's a clearing in my way 
I hope it's today 

Was it really you I saw in a dream last night? 
I was always there to grab you 
you didn't hold on very tight 
Yeah 

Guess I'll be on my way 
There's today 
A horseman died, so they say 
Yesterday, yeah
