The autumn breezes are blowing 
And I guess it was you 
That helped me through 
This time 

The winter's not yet showing 
But I ain't got the time 
To recite you a rhyme 
Anytime 

Yes I'd like to take you in hand 
To the land of windmills and chimes 

The night, she speaks so softly 
But there's always a place 
For a warm embrace 
When you're mine, oh baby 

Through the door to our freeland 
Where you'll feet the hand 
Says that I'm your man 
Kill the time, yeah 

Even talking in circles is fine 
In the land of windmills and chimes 

So see if you can find the time 
For the land of windmills and chimes 
Yeah!
