Well what the hell is wrong with you 
We're all living in a zoo 
The rich and the poor man 
All part of life's trash can 

Yes you know that someday 
We're all gonna pay 
For the wrongs that each man gave 
To all mankind, yeah 

The politician thinks he's fair 
He sits and rots in easy chair 
Decision making calms his mind 
He'll blow us all up in time 

And that time's getting closer each day 
Soon they'll all sell their souls away 
To the one downstairs they think protects them 
After they die 

Alright! 

Well, we might as well give up today 
Because there's nothing left for us anyway 

Alright!
