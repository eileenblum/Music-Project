Seen down every path of dark road 
Just Breaking myself taking too much load 
Seen taking too much load 

Too many weights resting on my back 
Had to look between the folds just for what I lacked 
Just for what I lacked 

Climbed up a tree without any limbs 
And overlooked my life 'til the lights got dim 
'til the lights got dim 

I saw no signs and no real true love 
No wheel to steer to the roof up above 
To the roof up above 

You'll never reach the clouds if you don't take the bait 
Ain't no light in a tunnel that's a figure eight, yeah 

As my motor grew weak, I hopped a four horse guide 
But disguised for a transport, I almost died 
Yeah, alright.
