When your fears all start to land 
Call the man 
I know he can 

When your feet touch upon distant lands 
Call the man 
I know he can 

Well, you've got to find a way 
To get yourself through the day 
But you're weak and you don't think you can 
I know you better run for the man 

If your love breaks apart, sorrow stands 
Call the man 
His helping hand 

He can build all your dreams, all your plans 
He's your man 
I know he can 

'Cause if your one says she don't love you now 
And you want her to, but you don't know how 
And you've done everything that you can 
I know you better run for the man, yeah 

Now I see how you have been banned 
Look for the man 
I know he can 
Look for the man 
I know he can 
You better look for the man 
I tell you he can 
Look for the man 
I know he can
