Well, you just sit and wonder why 
That every time you start to cry 
The memories and pain come running home 

Well, maybe you've got too much pride 
I can see that you hurt inside 
There's no way that you can right your wrong 

Well, your lonely hours are becoming whole days 
The pressure's clamping down 
Someday soon it's gonna drive you 
Into the ground, yeah 

Now deep inside your private dreams 
You found that life's not what it seems 
Never let your thoughts rise to the top 
And now I hope I've answered why 
Next time that you sit and cry 
'Cause you want me back, can't open up 

Well, your axis of thoughts has started falling apart 
Your comprehension drowns 
You better run for your shell 
Sack into the ground 

Your glass stays half empty 
But mine stays half full 
The sheep will always be shorn 
As the wolves move in for the kill, yeah 

Into the ground 
Into the ground 
Into the ground, yeah 
Into the ground, yeah 
Alright!
