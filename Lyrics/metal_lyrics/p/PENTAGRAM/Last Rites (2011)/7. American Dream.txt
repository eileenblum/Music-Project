We came into this land 
With a dream and an empty hand 
To pray to our chosen God 
Now we fain to wear a mourning band 
One by one we're letting go 
Of the strength that our people hold 
In deception, we disesteem 
And turn our morale into fool's gold 

Now we seek to light again 
The flame that burns within 
Before it's all been lost 
To politics, lined pockets, thick skin 
And as our time grows short 
The favored truth is to distort 
They wanna maker believers the fools 
But the judgment won't be in man's court 

The American dream 
Has fallen asleep 
If we wake the giant 
What will our people reap?
