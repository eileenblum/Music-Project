Walking the streets again tonight
Casting my shadow into the light
The hand of doom has taken me away
Evil forces calling and I'm their prey
You can see the sin within my eyes
I'm heading for my fate and its no suprise
Spending my time on satan's deceptions
Yes I'm falling, falling in his direction
Scared and lonely your wasting your time
You've got to give in theres nowhere to hide
Coming events are closing you in
You can't hide away your fears again
Live free and burn
Live free and burn
Live free and burn - oh burn baby
Live free and burn
Now your gonna burn
Live free and burn
Your ashes in the urn
Live free and burn
Now its your turn
To live free and burn
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!!
