Living like caged animals
Afraid to speak in words
The streets are wild, with maniacs
The wicked know who they serve
For you and me, society
Is a prison without walls
I'll have no remorse for you my friend
When the light of the kingdom calls
I can see the neon lights
It's the nightwatch your pursuing
Crystal smoke and all that coke
It makes you so inhuman
Mesmerized I see your eyes
I cannot gaze any further!
Lets start a nuclear war
It's our souls they've come to murder!
It's harvest time it's on your mind
Seperate the wheat from the chaff
It's judgement day and soon now you'll pay
Listen as the reaper laughs
Listen as the reaper laughs
Listen as the reaper laughs - yea
Starving child just wait a while
Your death it comes on wings
All the rest get rich and fat
They wouldn't give up a thing!
Manipulated concentration
Flows from your silver tongue
You've turned away, but still you'll play
When holocaust it comes!
The world will learn to love again
You godless child of Satan
Burn in hell all black sheep
It's harvest time it's on your mind
It's harvest time it's on your mind
It's harvest time it's on your mind - yea
