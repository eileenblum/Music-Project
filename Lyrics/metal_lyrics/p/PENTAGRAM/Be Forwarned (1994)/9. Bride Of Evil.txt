In the pitch
The black of night
I perform my unearthly rights
Your soul cannot be saved
I'll begin so please behave
Your fate is mine
Now behold this hypnotic stare
Look even closer if you dare
Your virgin skin so young and sleek
Penetrating bellows deep
Your fate is mine
Bride meets evil
Dark thoughts run through your head
Bride of evil
You shall live amongst the dead - ha!
(I said) the priest he can do no good
You live in my realm it's understood
And for my services there's a special fee
My unholy slave for all eternity
Your fate is mine
Bride meets evil
Dark throughts run through your head
Bride of evil
You shall live amongst the dead
An angry mob with stakes tonight
They're discovered my burial site
Weeping goddess take me away
Unto the killing light of day
Your fate is mine
Bride meets evil
Dark thoughts run through your head
Bride of evil
You shall live amongst the dead
Bride meets evil
Dark thoughts run through your head
You're a bride of evil
You shall live amongst the dead!
