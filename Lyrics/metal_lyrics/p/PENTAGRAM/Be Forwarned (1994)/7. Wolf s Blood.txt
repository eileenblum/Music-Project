I hear stories about the nightlife
But not the ones that you know
Tales of terror and desperation
Somewhere out in the cold
Under the moon
When we hear the hounds
What's going down
Something knows what it's all about
And I gotta find out - wolfsblood
Through the shadow it's coming for me
To create another undead soul
I feel the damp fur against my skin
Tooth and claw makes me feel so cold
Under the moon
I'm a night scout
Thats what it's about
I'll never die
Unless I go without - wolfsblood - wolfsblood - yeah
The silver bullets my only threat
Wolfsblood runs black it runs deep
We give your life that will last forever
The price of course your veins to sever - wolfsblood
