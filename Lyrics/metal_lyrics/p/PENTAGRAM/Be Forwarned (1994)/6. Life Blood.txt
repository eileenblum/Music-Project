Awakened in the night
I focus in
On my white satin ceiling
Is there no end
Since I've seen the sunrise
Twenty four score
Till I opened my eyes
Four score more
To face the night again - alone
Ten thousand souls wee taken
Bloodloss deserved
Only to be forsaken
By one I served
Through grief and all the rage
I fell from grace
Yet my love is survived
Still see her face
Still I face the night again - alone, alone
I lived to defend the cross
In the name of god
I died to avenge my loss
In vein for god - oh no
The blood ran thick and free
In fields of silent screams
And my love will survive
My love never dies
Death is my life
