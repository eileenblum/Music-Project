Who did rob the grave last night
I think it was you in your nightmare gown
The latch was open
The catch was broken
And the body was turned all upside down
What's behind those games you play in the dark
You're feet were all wet
And I can't forget
The way that you looked in your nightmare gown
What's it gonna take to end all your fun
A stake in the heart baby all will be done
Blood was on your neck
And mud was on the floor
I need to shoot you in the head - babe
I'm gonna roll you out the door - look out
Who did rob the grave last night
I think it was you in your nightmare gown
The latch was broken
And the coffin was open
And the body was turned all upside down
What's behind those games you play in the dark
Your feet were all wet and I can't forget
The way that you looked in your nightmare gown
What's it gonna take to end all your fun
A stake in the heart and all will be done
Oh look out
