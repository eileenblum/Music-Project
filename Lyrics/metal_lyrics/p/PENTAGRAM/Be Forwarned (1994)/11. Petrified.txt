Born in times when all was stone
All that's left is dust and bones
Somehow still she lingered to be
In Satan's clutch for eternity
You'll find out what you didn't believe
For like Medusa's web she'll weave
They call her a whore
But her charms meant more
For she'll petrify you below earth's floor
Chosen to return by command for death
Forced to inflict her immortal test
None see what they're about to go through
Until she's won and you turn blue
You'll be petrified, turn you to stone
Petrified...... dust and bone
Oh roll me over, won't you take me down
Petrified..... turn you to stone
Petrified..... to dust and bone
You'll be petrified..... turn you to stone
You'll be petrified..... dust and bones
You'll be petrified..... she's gonna turn you to stone
You'll be petrified to dust and bone
You'll be petrified nothing can help you now
