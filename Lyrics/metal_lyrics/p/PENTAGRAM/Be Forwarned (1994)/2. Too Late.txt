Where in hell are we going
Cause heaven just can't wait
There's a hole in the sky
And there's dreams a dying
And I wonder if it's too late, too late
Oh yeah - listen
Can't eat, can't drink, can't breathe the air
Drowning in a pool of hate
Losing time, losing our minds
And I wonder if its too late, too late
Thundering clouds, sixteen hooves
Trumpets fill the air
All your sins, gonna seal your fate
Cause I think that its too late, too late - yea
