Full moon on an endless night
I can feel the change
Clouds roar lightning strikes
Time to break the chains
Can't believe what you see
Something tells you come to me
I touch my lips to your breast
My teeth pierce your flesh
Vampyre love - vampyre love
King of darkness
Prince of the night - vampyre love
Ruby tears like rain
Flowing down your back
I hold you in my arms
Your vision fade to black
For everlasting love
Our souls have become
I've given you all of this
And seal it with a kiss
Vampyre love - vampyre love
King of darkness
Pince of the night
Vampyre love
Vampyre love - vampyre love
King of darkness
Pince of the night
Vampyre love
