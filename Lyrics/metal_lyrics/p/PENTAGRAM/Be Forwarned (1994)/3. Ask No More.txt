You're about to step up off the platform
You, the one who sold your soul away
To travel down my mind made moonlit passage
A million miles exactly to the day - oh yeah
The radiance of your mind will glow so brightly
Until you have dissolved your fears to dust
And burn away to no remains, but embers
I'll ask no more the time has come you must
Oh yeah - baby
