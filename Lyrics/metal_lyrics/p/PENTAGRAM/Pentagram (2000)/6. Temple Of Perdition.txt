Slaces of the temple of insanity
Praying for their redemption
Awaiting the horrors of death
Tormenting by their ignorance

Children of the temple of innocence
Adoring artificial images
Chanting the lies by heart
Banished to endless darkness

Priests of the temple of iniquity
Threatening the poor minds
Ruling the world with terror
Maddened by their own power

Souls of the temple of perdition
'Trapped in a maze of fear
Seeking the good shepherd
To be led to the slaughter
