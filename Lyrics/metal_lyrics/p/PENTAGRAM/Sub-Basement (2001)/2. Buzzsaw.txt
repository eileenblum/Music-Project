[By Bobby Liebling]

Ever get the feelin'
Couldn't take no more
All her dirty dealin'
Not my case I'm sure
live wire
electrocute my soul on fire
love me like a buzz saw
she gave it to me like I never saw, yeah
lovely roman candle
supercharge my brain
nothin' she can't handle
plays her own game
she's a fast pace setter
love me like a buzz saw
I got to go get her
she gave it to me like I never saw
there was a time, baby when I was young
I used to see everything, yes I did
oh, yeah alright
let's get on out of here (lead break)
she's a live wire
electrocute my soul on fire
you know she love me like
a buzz saw
give it to me like
I never saw
she's a fast pace setter
you know I got to go get her - yes I do
love me like a buzz saw
she give it to me like
I never saw before - yeah
