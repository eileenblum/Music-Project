[by Joe Hasselvander and Bobby Liebling]

Ever since I started out I keep on sinkin' in the pit
times change called my name told me that
I'd grow out of it
out of step and time
ain't worth a dime
or they told me so
I'll stay a wrong sided hit
I don't like what's on the radio
torn down and been condemned
like a tenement now
but in the trap door cellar
there's a special lamp glow
and still down deeper
where you cannot see with eyes
is the ramp to the damp
where the sub-basement cries
no escape
through the years and the tears
under black cloud skies
seems the lower that I go
is where my true heart lies
and when I'm stuck in the thick of it
there's no need to roam
some think of me as fried but it's a choice all my own
I've been called a dinosaur relic
stuck in the twilight zone
but stickin' in the sub-basement
keeps me lit to the bone
like the bats hanging dormant
in their nocturnal fleet
I'm still around underground
gettin' my peace without sleep
no escape
there's no way out
no doubt
no way out
so when the strands on the spiders loom
cast a glow in the room
won't be long for the web has caught a new prey for doom
and there ain't no worry
about any fee or rent
as long as cement songs keep climbing
out of the sub-basement
ain't no worry about no fee
and there ain't any rent
as long as cement songs keep climbin' out of the
sub-basement
no escape
ain't no doubt - no way out - no doubt
sssshhhh - aaaahhhh
