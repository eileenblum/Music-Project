Don't press me, don't second guess me
seems like everything's made a mess out of me
maybe that's why I'm still here
must have blessed me and brought out my fear
so don't press me, don't second guess me
I'm going in circles, reachin' for and end, you'll never get there my friend
You've problem that I can't address
get a bucket full of your own mess
use your mind's clean up crew
and you mop up the rest
I'm tired of always being put to the test
You've got a problem, well I sure can't address the mess so
clock keeps runnin' can't waste no more time
all that time runnin' ever gets me is gone
I keep the chill, and I am the pill maybe that's
why people think I'm so ill
if you feel a real comin' on
better keep it to yourself and write down it in a song
am I fadin' in or fadin' out
it all depends on where you stand in the circle no doubt
you can only fly by reachin' sky, so don't so dent fly
and crush your problems out - yeah
cause I've been in this shit for way to long
don't give me any lessons about what's right and what's wrong
you might say I'm at a stone stand still just please don't
forget when you're stuck
I can bet my head strong long will grab the top bill yet
goin' in circles yeah reachin' for an end I said you'll never
get there my friend, yeah
I said you're goin' in circles reachin' for and end
you'll never get there my friend
oh no goin' in circles yeah
