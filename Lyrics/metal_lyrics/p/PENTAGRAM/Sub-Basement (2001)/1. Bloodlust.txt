[By Bobby Liebling]

I was the finder and the keeper
I never though I would need to be the creeper
but my keeper
turned out to be the reaper
and now it's bloodlust
tales of woe I was strung out on the line
and I though my life was fine
it wasn't mine
fell a little short and ran out of time
and now it's blood lust
and nowhere to hide
the killing floor may drag me down
but not without a fight
and even though they think I've lost my soul
if they could just keep me confined at night
bloodlust, I can't turn the tide
bloodlust, I'm hungry inside
bloodlust, I'm filled up with hate
bloodlust, the eclipse of my fate
get outta here boy
now why does his happen to me
the flames like a fire burning into the sea
sticking like lightnin'  to blurred to free
and now it's bloodlust
the spark's in me
the killing floor may drag me down
but not without a fight
and even though they think I've lost my soul
if they could just keep me confined at
night cause I got bloodlust
I'm filled up with hate
bloodlust, eclipse of my fate
bloodlust, I'm hungry inside
bloodlust, I can't turn the tide
to bloodlust
