[By Joe Hasselvander and Bobby Liebling]

In sleepless night I hear the thunder
I fell the dead hands round my neck
no telling what's this spell I'm under
I breath a lifeless icy breath
so when I ask you get the driver
and tell him please be dressed in black
I need him right beside the grave
because you're never coming back
won't you get the driver
drive me to the grave
ah, please, I need him
or there'll be no one left to save
someone help me look for what I'm after
I'm chocking on the bad dream that I made
just try to stop the evil laughter
or there'll be no one left to save
so if I plead get the driver
and tell him please be dressed in black
I need him right beside the grave
baby's never coming back no no alright
they say we all got five bad points
well I got five of my own
I think they're bound to com through
when the meat gets down to the bone
so if  I plead get the driver
and tell him please be dressed in black
I need him right beside the grave
because you're never coming back
you send me home to bust my back
slap me to your torture rack
you're out all night you sleep all day
and when we talk I got no say
So when I plead get the driver
and tell him please be dressed in black
I need him right beside the grave
because you're never coming back
won't you get the driver
drive me to the grave
please I need him
or there'll be no one left to save
no one left to save
no no no
