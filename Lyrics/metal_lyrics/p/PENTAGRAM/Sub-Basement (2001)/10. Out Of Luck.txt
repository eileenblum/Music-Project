[by Bobby Liebling]

Dreary, caped figure roams
through the fields way past twilight hours
used to be a man
long time ago
now he's out of luck
tell me broken soldier
what shattered your dreams
I know it must have been bad
your hands are still tremblin'
there's not enough love to go 'round
I wanna help you get your feet
on the ground
so I'll leave a light in the tower
to light the moors through
your restless hours
before you call it quits
and say you're through
just remember baby, I used to be like you
a battle plunges
to a very lonely end
I saw a man who struggled
but whose life would descend
a thought rang through me
as I rounded home's sweet bend
the last words that he whispered
you're my mirror's lonely friend - yeah - alright
