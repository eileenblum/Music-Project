I'm gettin' so weary even stayin' in this song
I've fought many battles but this war is just way too long
gave the choices how to reckon was relentless as I warned
but there's something stayin' missin' and the drive is all but gone
with the age comes the rage and the stage brings the pain
like a fight with a hurricane the screams finally came
losin' my stride and tryin' to hide even pride is feeling wrong
though inside I know I tried it seems it's time to move along
like a champion in the twilight when the twelve rings round
can't stop hearin' the bells of thirteen think I'm bound for goin' down
but there's something stayin' missin' and the drive is all but gone
with the age comes the rage and the stage brings the pain
like a fight with a hurricane the screams finally came - yeah
yeah the one after the last I've heard bring the final blow
I pray it's fast and passed I'm huntin' for peace don't you know
I know it might be soon cause lately I'm needin' it so
bring with haste no time to waste I feel it's tome to go no more
it's time to face the fact that it's almost done
this one act play called life has reached it's final run
and though it's high at cost
I'll rest and realize I've lost
