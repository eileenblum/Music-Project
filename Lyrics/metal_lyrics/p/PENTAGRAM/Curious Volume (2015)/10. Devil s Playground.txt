All thoughts wet gray and ugly my mind misunderstood
I see the wind rip through me Iâd feel it if I could
Wake some days and feel like life is not for me
I hold my head low and slowly fall down to my knees

Venom inside, unconscious seed
Laughing obscenely itâs telling me
My headâs on fire and all I see
Is this black sky

Shake in desperation I jump at every sound
Throw my face into my hands
my bodyâs hit the ground
How can this all be over, where will I go from here
My mindâs creation,
suffering revelations writhe around in fear

Venom inside a poison seed
Laughing obscenely it sickens me
My headâs on fire now I see
My life a lie

Ravaging decay in the face of the living,
piece of rotting slow, drifting,
hiding, hungry, weak and aging man

......please help me up from this place Iâve been
each moment Iâm here, Iâm in too deep
and I die a little more

My mind was blind but now I see
The Devil inside was a poison seed
Canât kill my soul, only deceive
Brought back and now Iâm free
My life aliveâ¦â¦..
