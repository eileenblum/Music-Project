Sometimes the way you neglect things
Brings me to the finish of the rope
I let some of em slide but some I just canât hide
Maybe soon youâll see my words ainât no joke

You know Iâll drive if you make me after all been said
You never dump thundercloud hangin on your head
Look at where my caution light flickers up to red
You think itâs bad just out of work well itâs probably worse dead ---- yea ????

Everythingâs fine and if it revolves around you
And although times have to change in you is nothing new
Some get high pursuing their joys flying through the night
Itâs time to see your plane will crash
On the earthflight
