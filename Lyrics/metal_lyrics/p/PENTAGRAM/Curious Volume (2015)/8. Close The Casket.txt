These times try hard to drag me down
But where Iâve been Iâve learned to abound
Well if I fall, thatâs not all
For the love above has answered my call

My body shows age beyond its years
And underneath these scars are a billion tears
Through the eye of a needle that Iâve passed through
By the love above that never withdrew

The black passed away now my night is day
I close the casket on the old manâs ways
And now I see through the eyes that were blind
And close the casket as the old man dies

Been so far, been so near
High as the sun and dead to fear
But glitter ainât gold in every dream
And the choice you make breathes eternally

The black passed away now my night is day
I close the casket on the old manâs ways
And now I see through the eyes that were blind
And close the casket as the old man dies
