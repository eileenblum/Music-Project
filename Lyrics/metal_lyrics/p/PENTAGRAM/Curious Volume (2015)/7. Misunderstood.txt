You play with my heart, you play with my head
The feelings you show, I think you wish I were dead
Now you wanna have your fun and run around all night
And then you crawl back to me and honey that ainât right

You say you love me, Iâm your only man
But things you do I donât understand
Love I want itâll never come
Cause youâre nothing but a liar and itâs time to run
Misunderstood

You play with my heart, you play with my head
I donât give a damn bout the things you said
One thing I know, I know enough is enough
Iâll never trust you and Iâm calling your bluff

Pack your bags baby hit the door
Never wanna see your face no more
Time has come to say our good-byes
Along with the heartache and all of your lies
Misunderstood

You play with my heart, you play with my head
I donât give a damn bout the things you said
You wanna have your fun and run around all night
And you crawl back to me and honey that ainât right

Pack your bags baby hit the door
Never wanna see your face no more
Love with you itâll never come
Nothing but a liar and itâs time to run
Misunderstood
