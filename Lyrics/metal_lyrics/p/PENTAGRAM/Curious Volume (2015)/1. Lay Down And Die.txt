Talking about the last night
Thinking about the next show
You can stick around but I ainât gonna go
Maybe youâre proud bout the games
youâve been teaching
But you shouldnât be preaching
Thereâs too much you donât know

Youâre a backstreet crawler
Nothing left to the eye
Wonât ya move out of here
Baby, Lay Down and Die

I ainât no starter
when it comes to makin love
But when our hearts got parted
âand the grace from aboveâ
You should of thought harder
For the damage was done
But if youâre gonna have your fun
Iâll let ya think that youâre one

I still love you baby
Though I know it ainât wise
But still the tears fear my eyes
Baby Lay Down and Die!!

Oh my oh my!!!
