As I look up lifeâs long lonely tracks
Iâve realized there is no turning back
The glimmers of the hopes I had have faded
No peace now it is true because Iâve made it

My fantasies are gone all things have stopped
Engulfed or just confused no cold or hot
The love Iâve had for life has badly faded
In brightness or in dark, Iâve turned to shaded
The spark of life is gone because Iâve made it
No peace now it is true because Iâve made it
The story meets the end of how I hate it

No peace now this is true
No time for me and you
The colors all turn blue
Oh how I hate it

My limits overdue
And now itâs come true
The pain is almost through
Because I made it

I hate it
Now Iâve made it
I hate it
Iâve made it
