Facing toward the harsh wind blowing
Of dreams growing in my youth
The rich and poor of masses telling
Seek for security
Gather treasure and store away
This will bring you joy and peace
But like the grass that withers daily
Moths and rust pursue like thieves

Review your choice and the path you follow
For the kings of the earth will see
Theyâll seek your pride and your will to comply
Send you to war for their precious greed

So you hunger for a different way
Your ears have heard of this curious life
In this venture death waits in the shadows
But in survival the volume wonât die

Many choose but few are chosen
Slice through dark and patterns of light
The calling voice rings ever clear
A curious volume sustains and revives

So you hunger for a different way
Your ears have heard of this curious life
In this venture death waits in the shadows
But in survival the volume wonât die
The volume wonât die, Yeah!
