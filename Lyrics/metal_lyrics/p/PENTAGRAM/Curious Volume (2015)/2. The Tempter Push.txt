Thereâs a war thatâs a burnin inside
And itâs eating you
You canât win and you cannot fight
And canât afford to lose
You wander round canât be restrained
Canât be subdued
Tried to shackle and tried to chain
But the legion grew
Day and night in the concrete hills
You cut and bleed with stone
Got you down with your face on the ground

Time to overthrow
Many try but they turn and fail
Say what can faith undo
By the hand of the chosen one
The legion pigs were slew

Mercy on the broken man
Demons die unfree
Tempter push, stick the needle in
But bruised head will bleed
Host of wicked powers of the air roam to and fro
Steal and kill, destroyer of your soul

Now the war that was burnin inside
Are dying embers in you
The demons fled and the books been read
Give nothing to the devilâs due

Mercy on the broken man
Demons die unfree
Tempter push, stick the needle in
But bruised head will bleed
