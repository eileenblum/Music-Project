I say Iâm suffering
Iâve got to have you right now
But look what happens to us everyday
Thereâs someone tryin to tell us that we canât play
I sure need music get me on my way ?????
Youâre still my lover but Iâve got to say

Iâve been sufferin --- yea
Iâve got to have you right now
Iâve been knocking around with all the other kids
Iâve got no place to go
Iâve been working all of this useless shit
When I ought to be on the road

Iâm suffering
I need you right now
Iâm suffering
Please baby I gotta have you right now
Better come around and see me baby
You know Iâm all bummed out
I wish the record man would sign me up
I just want to jump and shout

Iâm suffering
You know I need you right now
Iâm suffering
Iâve got to have you right now
Iâve got ta, Iâve got ta
Iâve got to have you right now
