I can only see myself in broken mirrors
My voice sings of sorrow, will it ever get clear
Another day I roam and walk alone

Feeling the pain in force, how it claws at me
Keeps runnin its course trying to break my strength
Another day I roam and walk alone

Life without my past is where my future exists
Time bleeds in my wounds, but by God I resist
Another day I roam and walk alone

Give to misery my final tears
And cherish my goal of  life wonât disappear
Another day I roam and walk alone

Darkness of days have been cold
Winter skies are laced with shadows
Tear down these walls that bring me sorrow
Give me the hope that makes me stronger
