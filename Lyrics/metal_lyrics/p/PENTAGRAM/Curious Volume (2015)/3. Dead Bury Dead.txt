Been here too long to have the time to spare
Iâve walked down many roads to despair
Day by day my flesh and pride must die
Lust of my eyes tempt my mind to fly

How many days have passed,
how many more can I last
The broken dreams Iâve known,
circles of madness are gone
But I press on
Wonât be condemned
Take up my cross
Dead bury dead

Above the stains remains a joy inside
While a world out there seeks to break my stride
Like a dove descends and shoulders the wind
Not one will be lost from the hand that gives

To transcend these days, Iâd be on my way
Singing my final song in the light beyond

But I press on
Wonât be condemned
I take up my cross
Dead bury dead
