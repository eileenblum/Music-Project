Frustrating thoughts within my brain
There's not too much that's keeping me sane
Black cloud keeps hanging over my head
She's got me in her grips I've been misled
Can't get her out of my way of thinking
It's come to an end but I'm still sinking
Voices in my head are telling me to change
My soul is screaming our god's name
Sitting and waiting for feelings to pass
They go nowhere they last and last
Living in my world of complete solitude
No one can see what I'm going through
My mental wounds not wanting to heal
Tears fill my eyes I drop to kneel
Voices in my head still telling me to change
My soul is screaming our god's name
All right now
Won't you listen
Taking my time trying to get by
Living in the past dwelling on ties
Trying to overcome what she did to me
Left me behind after planting her seed
Her evil seed
Planted in me
Now I know just what it's like
Got in too deep and now I pay
Setting my course for the future
Now I've learned your wicked ways yeah
