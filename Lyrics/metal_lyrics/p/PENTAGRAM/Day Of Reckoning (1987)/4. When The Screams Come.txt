The time that you take to find out life
Is not usually worth itself
Developin' a real "How to get by"
And polishing all it's wealths
Have you ever felt pain
When the screams come you know
That you're dying in vain
Right
Don't say I didn't warn ya
You had it coming anyway
Now it's just a revelation
You pushed me too far
AND NOW YOU HAVE GOT TO PAY
Why don't we look at all the fools
Witness their greedy drools
You've entered hell I guess and weren't so cool
NOW SATAN MAKES YOUR RULES
