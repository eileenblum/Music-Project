Taking my chances through madness
Trying to leave my problems behind
Paying off my debts to sadness
I've got better things on my mind yeah
Winning my race with emotion
Can't waste more time falling down
Pulled under like waves in the ocean
Host myself but now I'm found yeah
Heatwaves of anger
Slowly burning down
Facing all my slander
Breaking all the vows yeah
Had given up the truth for lies
I've seen happinness come and go
Finding things that money can't buy
But your future is all in your soul yeah
Listen
Time slipping through your fingers
Tomorrow has become today
And as the image lingers
Of hell on earth to pay yeah
