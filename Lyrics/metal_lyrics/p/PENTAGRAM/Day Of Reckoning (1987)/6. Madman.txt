The talk of night is nearing
As the madman makes his rounds
The city lights appearing
Into surrounding towns
All the while I'll love you
But leave you as you sleep
For I have unfinished business
Right now I'm so weak
The cops are out patrolling
The new night has brought the word
Announcements from the city
It's brutal so I've heard
All the while I'll love you
But leave you as you sleep
For I may not see tomorrow
Right now I"m so weak
A lady saw the traces
She said of blood upon the grounds
But after all their searching
Nothing could be found
All the while I"ll love you
But leave you as you sleep
For I may not see tomorrow
Right now I'm so weak - oh no
I got home at midnight
No sleep I had to tell
Could I reach those heavens
Or was I born to serve him so well
Next thing I discovered
I awoke in the dark room
Clock struck five knife at my side
Your life had met with doom yeah
So as the new day opens
The sun is cast with gloom
And as the cover closes
I cry beside your tomb
Though I'll always love you
I couldn't stand the pain
Now it's time to take another life
A madman dies in vain
