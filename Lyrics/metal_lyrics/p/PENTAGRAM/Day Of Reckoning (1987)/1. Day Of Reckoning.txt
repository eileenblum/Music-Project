Now take your last look the world's about to fall
Your efforts are useless to move a brick wall
You didn't seem to listen to a thing I say
I think that today will become your day
So open your eyes to which path to take
The man's gunna laugh as your resistance he breaks
Butchers and cowards they've been running your life
This day is for reckoning if you wish to survive
Breakdown
So why don't you open your eyes to which path to take
The devil will laugh as your resistance he breaks
Please be strong stretch your arms down at length
He'll dance in the flames he thrives on your strength
