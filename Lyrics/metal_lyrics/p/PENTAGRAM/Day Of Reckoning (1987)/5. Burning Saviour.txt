Your lay your head down to sleep
And pray to your lord your soul he keeps
Hope that he answers all your pleas
A sinner like you ON YOUR KNEES
How long can you keep pretending
You can't live by the rules you're bending
All your prayers do no good
When you don't do what you should
LUCIFER LIVES it's no illusion
Your mind is in confusion
Thoughts denied all come true
When he takes your soul from you
Will you writhe and take his turn
But you have doubts not born to burn
Or will you choose the right hand turn
Goat of mendes standing by firm
No time left to pray and kneel
Open wounds will never heal
Your beliefs I'll always spill
Shut them down and now you're ill
Tears on your pillow so ashamed
Of what's going on inside your brain
Thoughts above becoming maimed
Take the plunge play the game
You will write and take his turn
I have no doubts you were born to burn
No one chooses the right hand turn
Goat of mendes standing by firm
You're walking through darkness
No need to look behind
The gates are open for you
You're welcome here inside
No more listening to reason
No more asking why
Just accept what you are given
No more guilt ridden sighs RIGHT
Time turning tolling bells
You're learning what I tell
Deceiving but not lies
Retrieving alibis
I laugh hearing you cry
Fire bath you want to die
Sizzling flesh and burning cells
Living dead for the god of Hell
You lay your head down to sleep
And pray to your lord your soul to keep
Hope that he answers all your pleas
A sinner like you ON YOUR KNEES
