[By Bobby Liebling]

I always wanted to reach this day
I fell such moods in the things I say
But the people tell me that I don't mean them anyway
There gonna get whats comin' now
Pretty soon I'm gonna show 'em how
Alright
Those sunny skies
Bring those distant cries
Of a dawn which is never gonna come
Oh yeah baby
You know what I'm talkin' about
Ha ha ha ha ha ha guitar
Over here
I want to make you believe in the things
You didn't think could exist
Is it finally time to relax your thoughts
Or maybe just wanna show 'em how
No I think perhaps I shall
Alright!
Lets get outta here
Drill 'em up
Alright
Break it down now
