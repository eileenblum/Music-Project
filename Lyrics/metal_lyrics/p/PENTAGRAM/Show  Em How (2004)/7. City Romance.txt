[By Kelly Carmichael and Bobby Liebling]

I used to hear really clear
the distortion that would rally my ear
took me 'round to this concrete town
called and pulled like a magnet no fear
And at night I held tight to the dark
City noose 'round my neck but I knew I'd never break
I love to bay at the moon while all the other dogs barked
I like the rainy bloody feel
of the city romancin' me
Never quite get my fill
The city always took its chance with me
All of the sudden I'd been caught
cause the underbelly in my soul had seemed bought
Closer I step to the edge of the ledge
where inferno meets ice my god! ow it went to my head
If I ventured any further to the end of the board
I like the "thrill of the kill" the "shudder click"
I'd be a bull seein' red
Don't not a one of you forget what I said
I want s' more rainy bloody chill
I need the city romancin' me
I never seem to stand still
My destined will can you hear me Yeah alright
I feel the thunder
Don't forget what I said
Smokestack lightning is my bed
Once more the rainy bloody chill in the air
I need the city romance can't stand still there
ooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww Yeah!
HUH, alright, gitit, shit, c'mon, thats it
that's what I said, now listen
The sidewalks have engraved in them my name
but on this Broadway no flash no flame
And whether it's wrong or right
I hear my partner in the wind howl no bark just bite
I guess I'm stuck being a gambler
for the rest of me it's my destiny
And people might think I walk this fine line for spite
so when you lay resting look real close at tonight and your life
For the glowing rope outside
your window yeah baby
It might be a time for your ride
I need the concrete deep inside yeah!
Alright
HUH!!
