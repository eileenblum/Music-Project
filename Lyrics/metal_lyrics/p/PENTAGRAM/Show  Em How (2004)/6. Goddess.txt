[By Bobby Liebling]

Shining like moondust you will lies in trust
I know I can't reach you though our hearts burn with lust
we both try and try and I start to realize
your love is gonna linger as my life passes by
and so I ask you this question
I've got to know before the storm cries
Are you a Goddess from heaven
or maybe just a holocaust in my mind's eye
Sparkle like dew on a flower at dawn
that's the way you land on me and make me carry on
Gentle as the drizzle on my window pane
If I could only love you once I know I'd make you stay
and still I ask you this question
and babe I've got to know before the flame dies
Are you a Goddess from heaven
or maybe just that phantom rider taking me to die?
