I was headed for the border just tryin' to hitch a ride
I'm goin' down to the south of the Tallahassee side
I bumped into a real fine slickster
We all know the type a nothin' but a trickster
Pushed into those too tight low cut jeans
Just like a fairy tale twister with all the lines and the means,
Yeah wwwwoooooo, thats right baby
As I gazed up past the keys
The color wasn't bright as the green in her eyes
And when she looked me up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down, I realized
That I was gettin' mesmerized
If she had the chance to get inside your head
She was the player and the dealer
Yeah take you down to size 'til your half dead
Smooth streamlined ride when you hit the wall
Doin' about a hundred
Blinded but not by what the sun did
Silk soft skin can't win
Elektra Glide yeah
Silk soft skin I can't win
My Elektra Glide baby listen
Give me a shot, uh
Whatever you got
Streamy steamy white hot
I can't stand up but I dig it a lot
Can't cage her with no flock
Got an ace in the hole to hit the bullseye spot
Comes on strong with whatever you need
In the last act she's gonna make you bleed, yeah
wwwoooo, ow!!
That's what I'm talkin' about, huh  huh yeah
Come on baby
mmmmm, yeah yeah, give it up
Smooth silk streamlined ride
When you hit the wall
Doin' about a hundred
You're blinded but not by what the sun did
Silk soft skin I can't win my Elektra Glide
Silk soft skin I can't win she's my Elektra Glide
wwwwwwoooooooooooo
C'mon Kitty Kat
Gimme where it's at
mmmmmmm gotsho number dere
ow yea look out!
