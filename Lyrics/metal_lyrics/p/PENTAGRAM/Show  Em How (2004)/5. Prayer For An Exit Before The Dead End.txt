[By Kelly Carmichael and Bobby Liebling]

I'll never forget the days the for for quarter plays
the gang back in out everlasting first
when much in younger thirst for hunger
To keep the unified divided we thought we differed so
that so said code to live and nurse
Yeah
I don't know how even now you brought real morals
to my self made laws before I knew ya I'd say screw ya!
And all the more as may sewin' oats weren't flaws, yeah
c'mon baby that's right, now listen
But somehow through the wreckage what the heckage
and a little wisdom surfaced since brought friends then a love
them almost a wife and desire to finish
a jigsaw puzzle of years unglued crumbs
pieced and scattered my life back to one mmmmmmm
causin' notches conquered crotches
finally saw was just hell on earth
Finally no need to ramble or keep the gamble goin' too hard
can only hasten the end just needed this pause
To express the greatest cause
To feel the memories followed by the claws
Digging deep back to band with my starting line
yeah yeah baby, oohhh, tell ya
A life even friends I need even friends
Give me back my life baby
I need it so bad
That's the full circling swirl
I want to unfurl a prayer before the exit
The undertows thunder
to the no sea to see the unknown yet
That's the full circling swirl
my want to unfurl a prayer before the exit
And undertows thunder
to the no sea to see the unknown yet
baby yeah yeah
oooooooooooo
the dead end yeah
aw cry
c'mon
Thats the full circling swirl
I want to unfurl a prayer before the exit
The undertows thunder
to the no sea to see the unknown yet
Thats the full circling swirl
my want to unfurl a prayer before the exit
And undertows thunder
to the no sea to see the unknown yet
baby yeah yeah
I know
mmm yeah yeah
Got to be things are gone
won't you help me baby, yeah yeah
Yeah face the dead end
Alright c'mon yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah baby
IT'S GOT TO BE THE DEAD END!
