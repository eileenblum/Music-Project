[By Bobby Liebling]

There was that time when you'd gone away you'd been led astray
My worries they built and built had reached the hilt I was filled with guilt
What could bring you back to me?
I'd try the saddest love song and wait to see if the winds would change
If the winds would change
Cause I need to know yeah
All my nights and days begin to seem the same they begin to seem the same
ooooooooooo
A grip of sorrow can be so clear when you loose something dear defeat comes near
But baby I got the strongest hold I might be slow but I won't let go
Until I brought you back to my side I'll be signing that same song
About the nights I cried for the winds to change
I wish the winds would change
Yeah I need to know
All my nights and days they begin to seem the same they begin to seem the same
ooooooooooo
A grip of sorrow can be so clear when you lost something dear defeat comes near
But baby I got the strongest hold I might be slow but I won't let go
Until I brought you back to my side I'll be signing that same song
About the nights I cried for the winds to change
I wish the winds would change
Yeah I need to know
All my nights and days they begin to seem the same they begin to seem the same
ooooooooooo love you baby!
Oh yeah
