Crimson lace and your pretty face I don't need ya
I don't know what's behind this strange embrace but I don't need ya
Well the feelings rise and your wondering eyes should I tease ya?
I guess it was all to my surprise I wanna please ya
And I'm out on a Catwalk so why don't you come and rescue me yeah
You're a rocket ride in your own kinda way that you love me
And you've heard all about mistreaters not you come love me
Well I need you little woman I'm a gypsy on a tight rope so hold me
You're a message from hell I sill love ya because the devil he told me
I'm out on a tight wire don't let go you control me
Well alright!
Hey world go away I wanna get off at the very next stop
You better take away the lady cause I think I THINK my minds gonna pop
I need a rocket reducer cause I want this ride to stop
It was o.k. for a while but I'm hopin' that soon you're gonna give up
So I guess I'll stay on my Catwalk no one can touch me there Yeah
