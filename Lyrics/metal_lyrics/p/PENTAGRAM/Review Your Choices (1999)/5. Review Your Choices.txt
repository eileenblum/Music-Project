[By Bobby Liebling]

Man and woman try to keep a tie
While looking at what passes by
Village thieves and all the tramps
Somewhere someone left in some gaps
Look before you leap my friend
Should god take you in his hand
It's a very small price for you sins you spend
And there's a man with a pitchfork around the bend, oh yeah
Got my soul - Alright - Let's go
The evil churns, you'll start to burn
But will you crack, I know we can't turn back, oh no
Review all your choices now
There's no one around to show you how
But the hand coming down has reached its end
You know who's still coming around the bend, yeah
Yeah, around the bend, yeah
