[by Bobby Liebling]

You hurt me with your mind games
And baby's so frigid, you're about to drive me insane
But I have no fear, 'cause he always sets the course
Yeah, watch it
Take a step out of the shadows
Take a peekin' at your game
Baby's sweet and good-looking
I know you're wicked just the same
Yet I have no fear, 'cause he always sets the course
I've been livin' in a ram
I'm doin' what I can - Well, alright
