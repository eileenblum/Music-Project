[By Bobby Liebling]

I think that it's time for all this messin' round to stop
Cause I've finished speaking
Of all those hurricanes and getting down to cop
If you'd like me to make myself more clear
I've been tortured to the end of my wits
By the burning rays of the sun, ah
The burning rays of the sun, yeah
Now look out
'Cause I'm finally sure
That this is the way
My life was meant to be
I'm stuck in a rut
And baby I can't get out
But I never asked now one
To sympathize with me
So I'll be blunt
I'll get straight to the facts
I thought I'd do well
But I just got stabbed in the back
Listen, the days will go on shedding their light,
but it's much to bright for me
From the burning rays of the sun,
The burning rays of the sun, let's go
