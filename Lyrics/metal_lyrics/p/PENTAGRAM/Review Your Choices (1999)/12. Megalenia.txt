[By Joe Hasselvander and Bobby Liebling]

Some of you say may claim to amuse
And once shown you'll insist it's a ruse
Then those who fought the battle could only lose
For in it time megalania rules, there's no use
More than simply a meal without a match
And though the crocodile has his snap neck latch
To a mortal man a fearsome catch
Ha! Even it would cower when the young would hatch
Mmm-mmm
Crocodile strides but only with bursts of speed
Just another handicap that the lizard didn't need
No need to stop at all, megalania challenge and then they all fall
At 25 or 30 feet only it fed on warm blood 'n' meat
And rand a torrid sprint with a 40 mile pace
Or kept the strength at a distance race
Don't trip or you'll find yourself a nice hiding place
One glance strikes the fear of god in you face
No logic pulls toward you time
For it came through the ice age with no reason or rhyme, yeah
What I said
Abandoned with the past down under
Even in the bush staggered with thunder
Mmm-hmmm, nightmare, everyone's here
A megalania again has appeared
That's right
I know the rumble, it's only him
Perhaps your torso, or just a limb
And crush and maul in the night of the iguana
Please commence the demon even though you don't wanna, ha!
Only mounties charter him well
Ten megalania back to hell, alright
