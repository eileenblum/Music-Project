[By Joe Hasselvander and Bobby Liebling]

Sometimes the way you neglect things
Brings me to the finish of the rope
Some I let slide
Some I can't hide
Maybe soon you'll see that my word ain't no joke
I'll drive you if you make me after all has been said
You'll never dump my thundercloud hangin' on your head
Look out when my caution light turns to red
You think it's bad out of work but it's probably worse dead
Come with me now
Changin' and how
I'll make you stay
You still run away
I'm confused now, I'm going crazy
I got the gun now, it's getting hazy
How did you know that I would leave
I'm fallen back now just to deceive
Crank my amps
Take a stance
My god, the music's never been this loud before, yeah
Some get high, pursue their joys
Fly into the night
Time to see your plane will crash
You're on the earth flight
Come with me now, changing and how
I'll make you stay, you still run away
How did you know this change of heart
I've gone insane now, I'm falling apart, yeah
I'm confused now, I'm going crazy
I got the gun now, it's getting hazy
How did you know this change of heart
I've gone insane now, I'm falling apart, yeah
