[By Bobby Liebling]

Watch the people, they're up at six
You go to work and no one relax
Well this is it, yeah, I hope you saw
What's in this rotten world we're living for
Swarm Like bees, with their discontented pleas
And when fate stings another joy it brings
You'd better look around, yeah, at what your greed does
For maybe in your sleep you'll hear a buzz, right
