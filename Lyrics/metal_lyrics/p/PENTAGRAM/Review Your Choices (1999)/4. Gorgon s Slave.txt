Down below the galleys where the faring men ate
Lay the granite for the tombs and the tools to carve slate
All the piracy flourished seeking shillings and eight
At the time there was no knowledge of the map of their fate
For at starlight and moonglow there were none to be saved
One digs too deep, he passes treasure to his grave, yeah
In the night they behave
Now they're Gorgon's slave
When the eyes of Medusa stare them into their grave
Yeah, yeah
Let the moondrops fall, hear the screams in the hall
For when there's no one to stand guard
Only future futility to hear their call
It's the beast you may think drives the sane to the brink
Now the Gorgon's suspended the life in them all, yeah
Though they boasted glasses were empty, none there were brave
Couldn't cut from the gut of the Gorgon's slave, yeah
In the night they behave
Now they're Gorgon's slave
When the eyes of Medusa stare them into their grave
They came to take the jewels and eight
Now forever they will wait
But none cut from the gut of the Gorgon's cave, yeah
Frozen down deep in suspended sleep and the mad cries rave
Let the moondrops fall, hear the screams in the hall
When there's no one to stand guard no one is saved
In the night they behave the Gorgon's slave
When the snakes of Medusa tie a leash to the grave, yeah
Alright, alright
In the night they behave now the Gorgon's slave
When the snakes of Medusa tie a leash to the grave
yeah, yeah
