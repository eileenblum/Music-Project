[By Joe Hasselvander and Bobby Liebling]

Many ways the mind will stand unnatural limits of pain
The child hopelessly searching sanctuary lost in the rain
The point that pierces and poisons, impregnates the vein
Later only to wonder why we're on the board
Just to conclude by being driven insane
Seems there's no way around it out, ha
For one must be the hunter, the other labeled prey
As sirens fade in the night, ha ha
I am Vengeance, the Game, Yeah
That's what I'm talkin' about
Always to continue the on and ons
Their trickery designed for our own brain,
But just one original can stay the same
Etched unscathed indelible to prevail for reign
And malice looks like you shadow
like the wolf to the bane, yeah
Performance forever keeps the search for fame
Close your eyes but never sleep
Keep alarm to the mind as life slowly creeps
to be sucked down the drain
Just please remember, and forget never
Better listen because - ha! -
I am Vengeance, the Game, yeah
C'mon baby, yeah, mmmm-mmmm-mmm
Father such a merciful
Said father such a merciful, yeah
Well father won't you have mercy on me please
Look here, I'm down on my knees
Have mercy on my soul
Watch this
Father such a merciful Pearcy
Your warped figure we see manifest the hurt, see? Ha!
Or should I think that maybe something's just a little
tilt to you divine nursery
And it may be possible this little tiny
devout-like spit to the griddle
The making over requires and order for some surgery
