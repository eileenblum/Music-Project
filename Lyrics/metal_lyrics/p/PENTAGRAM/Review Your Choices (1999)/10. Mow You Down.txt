[By Joe Hasselvander and Bobby Liebling]

Sick of all you promises
Can't take no more lies
Won't be long so you'd better move on
'Cause I'm gettin' that look in my eyes
Gotta mow you down
You know that I see right through you
Just when I thought that I knew you
Time we shared together got suspended
Now I'm so glad it's ended
I gotta mow you down
You know that I see right through you
Just when I though that I knew you
You were a nasty old habit
Yeah, you can take it and have it, c'mon baby - hey!
Mow you down - Mow you down
I got to mow you down - Ah, c'mon
Get out of town
Sick of idle promises
Can't take no more lies
It won't be long, so you better move on
'Cause I'm gettin' that look in my eyes
Mow down
Look out
Mow down
C'mon baby
Mow down - mow down
