They eat through your head
And straight to your brain
The decisions they make
Slowly drive you insane

This is the brotherhood of satan
And they're forcing you to kill
The apocalypse is now
Revalation being filled yeah

You seem so self-assured
When your leaders speak
But the lies all come out
When the power grows weak

So they only hide away
Unworried and unsure
Still feeding on your blood
Still searching for a cure yeah

You believe in your father
In his love so strong
But the thoughts you've been given
Well they come out so wrong

And on your day of judgement
You'll know who's in command
No man's law will matter
Under God's saving head yeah
