Thereâs bound to beâ¦ Terrorism/and schism/thriving on in drovesâ¦
Itâll beâ¦ Pilfered/ripping/ramshackle/device rolling on...Through irrelevant wallsâ¦
Itâs sad itâs literalâ¦Extortion of opinionâ¦Itâs more politicalâ¦
So it goesâ¦ right/over/my/headâ¦ Whoâs the enemy? Do one and one make three?
Thatâs the questionâ¦Itâs right/directly/underneath/our noseâ¦
Land/scape(s)/overrun/by tanks/ crash through the dead meat
Panic/stricken/nay-sayers /got just what they paid forâ¦And keep paying forâ¦

Itâs taken literalâ¦The conquest for deceptionâ¦
Fear is subliminalâ¦And it goesâ¦ right/into/our/heads
Whoâs the enemy? Do one and one make three?
Thatâs the questionâ¦ Thatâs right/directly/underneath/our noseâ¦
Scape/goat/tattooed devils/take to the skyâ¦ the perpetual myths will not dieâ¦
Itâs not debatableâ¦ When fact yields phantom fictionâ¦
Itâs fucking pitifulâ¦That itâs drilled/right/into/our/headsâ¦
Does one and one make three? Thatâs the questionâ¦I wonderâ¦? Whoâs the enemy?
