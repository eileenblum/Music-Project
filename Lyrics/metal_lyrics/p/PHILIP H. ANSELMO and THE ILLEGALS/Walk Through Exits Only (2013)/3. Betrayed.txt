Iâve been betrayed revolt! how can they sleep with themselves at night?
When the blur that surrounds them distracts and then blinds?
This is a call for mass awareness/this is the time to stand resolute!
Youâve been betrayed insult! How can you crash so contented at night?
When the engine that drives you is bullshit disguised?
This is a call for mass preparedness/ we must stand resolute/inherently resolute!

I believe in mass obliquityâ¦Iâm convinced of a hidden agendaâ¦
Iâm amazed at the mass hypnosis (I see)â¦âTheyâveâ got us right where they want usâ¦
Iâve been/youâve been/weâve been/all are betrayed!
Thereâll come a boiling point
A swallow-chew-and-spit implosion
Collapse is long-forewarned auguryâ¦ The loudest tongue will lie about itâ¦
The whorish tongue will lie about itâ¦
Weâve been betrayed repulse! how can I sleep with myself at night?
When all I have done is consented and thrived?
But this is my voice and Iâll rally the call-
We must stand resolute/extremist resolute
Iâve been betrayed revolt!
