Itâs ruined. Everybody ruins musicâ¦ Not just meâ¦
You saw it/You liked it/Embraced it/Then faked itâ¦Not just meâ¦
(Iâm) jaded and over it/sick of the whole of itâ¦ Everything piles upâ¦
Until I burn it in the trash/rip it up and turn it into ashesâ¦ exitâ¦
Itâs ruined. Everybody ruins musicâ¦Not just meâ¦
You heard it/You learned it/You dressed it/(and) Accessed itâ¦
Not just meâ¦(Iâm) jaded and over it/sick of the whole of itâ¦
Everything piles upâ¦ Until I burn it in the trash/shred it up and incinerate to ashesâ¦ Exit!
Everything piles upâ¦Until I burn it in the trash/incinerate and turn it into ashesâ¦ Exit!
I walk through exits onlyâ¦ Because I can.

We are no different/Iâm not paving the wayâ¦ See?
Itâs indifferentâ¦Iâm not saving the dayâ¦(Therefore) we are no differentâ¦
So it drives us awayâ¦The flame is incentiveâ¦So I burn it awayâ¦
Like rabies amongst ratsâ¦Everyone ruins the music as time goes byâ¦Not just meâ¦
You jacked it/Then hacked it/Devalued/And stole itâ¦Not just meâ¦
Iâm jaded and over it/sick of the whole of itâ¦Everything piles upâ¦
Until I burn it in the trash/incinerate and turn it into ashâ¦

A comeback doesnât come gentlyâ¦itâs as ugly, as ugly isâ¦
Made of hedonist handcuffsâ¦crushing weightsâ¦ neurotic accuracyâ¦and kills love outrightâ¦
So burn it/one precious chunk/at a timeâ¦Thereâs no reading between the lines.
Like fire that falls from the skyâ¦ Like fleeing a monster of natureâ¦
Like a bullet born of a madmanâ¦Thereâs no reading between the lines.
Like disappearing from the face of the planetâ¦Like being cut in halfâ¦
Like having everything and burning itâ¦Thereâs no reading between the lines.
