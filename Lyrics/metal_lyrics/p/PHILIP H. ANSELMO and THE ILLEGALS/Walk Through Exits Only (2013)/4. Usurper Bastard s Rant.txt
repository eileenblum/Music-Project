And rant with meâ¦

Rant! (And Iâll slip/and shake/Iâll slip/and stick) Let them fall on their assesâ¦
Rant! Itâs this reputation/an institution/reiteration/I will destroy traditionâ¦ andâ¦
Rant with me rant! (And Iâll slip/and shake/then slip/and stick) Let them fall on their assesâ¦Rant!
