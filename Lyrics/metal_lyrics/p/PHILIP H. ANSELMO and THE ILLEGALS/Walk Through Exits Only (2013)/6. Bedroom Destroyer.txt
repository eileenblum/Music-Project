Cold beer scalds my back molarsâ¦ Cold beer fattens me up for depression and I use depressionâ¦
I will use this depression just like a weaponâ¦And itâs aimed at me, and anyone who dares to come too closeâ¦
Iâve washed some feetâ¦ (I thought) Iâd made it upâ¦
Iâve kissed some feet but still they stomp on meâ¦ Tantrum!
Bedroom destroyedâ¦ Bedroom destroyerâ¦

Framed faces bring spelled leaden guilt tripsâ¦ I could smash those faces with my worthless tales of yesteryearâ¦
Count yourselves as shit-heel fortunateâ¦ You donât have to live with this; my asinine paranoid-trenchesâ¦
Iâve grabbed at handsâ¦ (I thought) theyâd lift me upâ¦
Iâve grabbed some hands but still they beat me downâ¦ Tantrum!
Bedroom destroyedâ¦ Bedroom destroyerâ¦

Iâm pulverized byâ¦Fat, sloppy fears andâ¦Iâve wrecked this room/deck, once againâ¦But it doesnât matterâ¦
You wonât find meâ¦ Iâm hidden in a black room somewhereâ¦Iâm the boarder of thousandsâ¦(Of) undisputed demonsâ¦
And Iâm laying them on you thick-likeâ¦Because Iâm a talkerâ¦And Iâm a doerâ¦
And Iâll devour this place, sober and drunk Sober or drunkâ¦Hail to the king of the pillow and pillâ¦
My screams scare the birds out of every single tree for milesâ¦With a voice once heard but best forgottenâ¦
Trapped inside a closet inside 30-rooms and half a mileâ¦I grabbed a knifeâ¦But there is no fightâ¦
Iâve grabbed a knife, but thereâs no fight for meâ¦.Tantrum!
Bedroom destroyedâ¦Bedroom destroyerâ¦
