Taunting the law of man

Sebaceous provocateur of kills
(With a) wanderlust recidivism
Title this star, "Death"
Talismaniacally murder-theistic

Furious burden of Reapers
Total victim's count unknown

IQ under 70, yet the prey is outsmarted
What does this say for (the) supposed educated?

Title this star, "Death"
Talismaniacally murder-theistic

Furious burden of Reapers
Total victim's count unknown

Slashed tires, feigned distress
And then, it pounced

The driver tried to run the murderer over
But she missed
Slashed tires, feigned distress
Crestfallen, feigned intent
Homicidal

The last of eight
Indoctrinated
Went on a spree that hasn't ended
Corpses found, mutilated
Wounds suggestive of cannibalism
Eviscerated

Human debris

Strangle
Masturbating
Over crumpled deceased
Photographs found at the scene

Taunt(s)
Terrorize the diaspora
With smothering crux puzzles

Title this star, "Death"
Talismaniacally murder-theistic

Furious burden of Reapers
Furious burden of hands
Furious burden of non-closure
Spurious murderer planning
(A) painless, sober suicide on a dim October dawn
