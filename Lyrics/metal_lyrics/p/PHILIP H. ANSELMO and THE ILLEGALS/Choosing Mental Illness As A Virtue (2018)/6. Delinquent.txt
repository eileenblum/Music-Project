The lab botched the job
Alchemy's return of a sorcerer
An odium transition's not always odious

Over-conflict is critical
This treacherous work (is) all-encompassing
Rancorous cast of casualties devised

Simmering and seething invert symbols of autocrats

Delinquent

A baling wire act in infancy
Massage parlor tricks used for years
Pull-away sets of cardboard

Painted wax foreground cutouts
This is how the hell to do it
Spinning in a circle, phone in hand

Simmering and seething invert symbols of (the) lost

Delinquent
Confabulation

The mentally-ill have been given platforms
Extended into mainstream, deplorable of dregs

The remnant of original backdrop burns

Confabulation

The mentally-ill have been given altars
Indoctrinated autists, deplorable instructors

The remnant of original backdrop burns

Confabulation

The mentally-ill have been given scaffolds
(And) most will get duped, (at) pentobarbital lecterns

The backdrop burns

Simmering and seething invert symbols en backwards

Delinquent

Original thoughts publicly shamed
Parroted groupthink nonsense exalted
This culture rewards intellectual deviance

The denigration of contrarian thinking
Regurgitation of the likewise ignorant
Stupor on an industrial scale

Simmering and seething (always)
Invert symbols of (the) cost

Delinquent

Forged, ill-humanist, outlook

The people that are last to figure things out
Are the people most likely to remember it longer
