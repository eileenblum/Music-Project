Like a tried and tested beacon
Cowardly fingers tap
Dumb as a claw hammer
In line to strike for trips

Hawkish isolationist
Incursion foist
Mugged aggrandizing
Maladroit pilloried parse

Fucking ancillary limbic
Overarch ensconced
Palavered exculpation

Walk through fire
Walk through fire
Walk through fire
Walk through fire

The true story left untold
It's coming to the grave (with me)

Nascent, grouse, lockstep, plaudits

Blithely sinister and circuitous
Prose-pose via gadfly

Fucking Capgras Illusion
Meets Stapelia Gigantea
The reek invades in multiplicity

Walk through fire
Walk through fire
Walk through fire
Walk through fire
I walk through fire
I walk through fire
I'll walk through fire
I'll walk through fire

There is hatred in these words
No crooked finger could finger
Despite how much you want it
There is loathing in these words
That no finger could finger
Despite how much you want to

I do my job and you will do yours
I do my job and you will do yours
I can count on my fingers (the times)
And I know I can count on you

I simply count on my fingers (the times)
And it always equals four fucks and you
Four fucks and an all of you
Four fucks and a you
Four fucks and a...

You pissed my pants with culled indigent stabs
Without a passing nod
To face intended target

Peccadillo, mellifluous
Tongue in permanent insert, firmly into cheek

Isn't it amazing how many will push a myth to maliciously propel a flawed notion chamber?

Fucking desiccated ordinal impugned

Walk through fire
Walk through fire
Walk through fire
Walk through fire

There is hatred in these words
No crooked finger could finger
Despite how much you want it
There is loathing in these words
That no finger could finger
Despite how much you want to

I do my job and you will do yours
I do my job and you will do yours
I can count on my fingers (the times)
And I know I can count on you
I simply count with my fingers (the times)
And it always equals four fucks and you
Four fuck and an all of you

It's disingenuous, it's poisonous
So I'm calling bullshit on the whole distraction racket

You're all fakes

I do my job and you will do yours
And you will suck and then swallow
