Clog the timorous
With brilliant reaction backlash
The Orwellian determining factor
In milk-sop grave digging

Mope the shovel in paw's render
Wedged head into a trophy mount
(You) little fucking heroes

Tucked tail and a starfish stroke
Un-credulously pious
Acromegaly expanse
Apoplexy seismic

Drab quisling neophyte
Wedged head into a trophy mount
(You) little fucking heroes

Wedged heads mounted

Torrential and top-heavy
Barrel-chested infant
Sink the tears for tit-sucks
In voyeurs proximal

Anyone
With a pair of eyes
Should be able to logically see it
For what it really is

Riding the coattails of infamy
(You) little fucking heroes

Just finally admit you're jealous
Of the riddle that is me
It's evident and a sickness
(And) just because you're
"Down with the cause"
Don't ever assume the ridiculous mistake
That the cause is down with you
Little fucking heroes

Riding the coattails of infamy
(You) little fucking heroes
