Leave me be
In shadowed splendor
After alight empowered
Cast runes deployed
To all specific targets

Inure and curse

(With) tasteless transition translations
Hidden sequence enclosed

Vengeful jaundiced poxes
Vintage enemy archiving

Of all specific targets
Coerced (to) threat-filled syntax

Inure and curse
Darkest Art's assassination

Utopian
Subject in the palm of depth's left hand
Imperturbable possession of grieving faculties
Wise not to provoke ire of this scorn
Manipulating battery of cordial contempt and fear
Maligned vengeful obnoxious projections
And believe
The vintage enemy checklist exists

All fear thee
Inure and curse

Leave me be
And all fear of thee
