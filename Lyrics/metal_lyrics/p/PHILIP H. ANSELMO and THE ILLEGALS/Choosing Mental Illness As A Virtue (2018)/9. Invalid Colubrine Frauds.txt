The suspect in a shooting was 16 years old
He'd left behind five dead
And (he) said nothing when apprehended
The gunman opened fire and fled

The first urgent calls came at 7 PM
The second at 7:01
The third came not long after
Then the tires beneath the squads
Screeched the pavement

This all was senseless, senseless
Community latest on a list of mass shooting

The person had a rifle
And was shooting people in their heads in beds

By the time the cops arrived at the despicable hour
The carnage was complete
And true and disgraceful and scarring

There are people
Waking up this morning, and their world
Has changed forever

This all was senseless, senseless
Mortify, terrorize, (it's) too close to home

This all was senseless, senseless

Vaguely put, there are two types of people
One logical half that just want to be left alone
And then the other are the sick motherfuckers
Who won't leave them alone

Like a mullet to garbage
Like a dog to puke
Eat it up, regurgitate, shit and run

Colubrine frauds amongst people
Render them invalid, bloodsuckers of peril
Colubrine frauds amongst humans
Render them invalid, vultures of peril
Colubrine frauds amongst the sane
Render them invalid, leeches of peril
Colubrine frauds amongst humanity
Render them invalid, devourers of peril
Colubrine frauds amongst our future
Invalid
