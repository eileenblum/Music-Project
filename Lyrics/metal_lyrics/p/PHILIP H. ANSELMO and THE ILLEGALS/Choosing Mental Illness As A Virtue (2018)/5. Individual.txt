(I) stand tall
I don't need a fucking one of you
If you disagree with me, that's good
That's great, it's understood

I don't want to be part of your pack
(Or) your leader, your follower, (your) ambassador

Shut the fuck up
And don't even listen
Individuals will disperse
Now

Lone wolf mentality slaughters its kin
(And) stands tall
With independent, bloodied jaws

If you agree with me, go fuck yourselves
I will never be what you created
That pack won't hunt anymore
Lone wolf thrives

[Axe Solo: DeLeon]

Shut the fuck up
And don't even listen
Individuals will disperse
Now

Lone wolf mentality slaughters its clan
(And) stands tall
On non-dependent, staunch, Law of Claw

If I agreed with you, we'd both be wrong
Don't ever tell me that you're sorry
(Because) I know how sorry you are

The lone wolf mantra is primal and divine
Nothing is impossible, and it never was
The lone wolf mantra should be lauded, not opined
Nothing is possible, without these jaws that bite down

I don't want to be part of your pack
(Or) your leader, your follower, (your) ambassador

Shut the fuck up
And don't even listen
Individuals will disperse
Now

Lone wolf mentality slaughters the pack
(And) stands tall
On independent strength, and Law of Claw

It's for better or for worse, but not for long
If you disagree with me, that's good
That pack won't hunt at all

Lone wolf thrives
Stealthy, tracking, haunts

Rabidly, gnashing, pelt and teeth, embolden me
Lone Wolf Decalogue
