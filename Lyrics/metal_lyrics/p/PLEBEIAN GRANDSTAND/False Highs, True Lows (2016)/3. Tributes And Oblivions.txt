Being born
Dawn to age too late
To turn back
Now city kills stars share
The candle whose flame lights the past
And you can feel the void chance of life
Fragile appearance evidence challenging free
Will to carry the burden of hope
Embrace the clarity of the sun
Unripe watch cape kept years gone
Time flies cells die map and
Field donât match
Field is not wrong
Control obtained loosened grip
Field is not wrong
Road is not long
Having to suffer
Lose beloved ones
Waves have shaken the hull wheel
Grabbed tooth and claw
Collisions cloned and constant bruises
Chained power of sparing life
Suspicious lightness
Primitive shadows around
Mysteries of the night cape kept
Split mast soon old late wise
