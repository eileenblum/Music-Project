This thirs of life
Paid by death
Permanent cycles beyond good and evil
Talons claws fangs used to draw blood
Life feeds on death
Primitive intelligence brute force blind Energy
Will to power thinking substance
Without stretch
Without body
Without shape
Plastic changes driving force of wild thoughts
The paths are accurate
