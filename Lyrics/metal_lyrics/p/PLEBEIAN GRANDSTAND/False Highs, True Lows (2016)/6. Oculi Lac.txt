Hand that ones held
Is now crumpled and sick
Shoulders that felt made of brick
Are now weak
Calf beliefs mature griefs safety off
All alone certitudes that protected from anguish
Mother of melancholia on knees you sat
Later became feverish
The net is gone on the neck
You may fall broken bone
Secure womb place you called home
Is deserted and dull sobs
Go unheard
Nobody knows youâre hurt
You canât crawl
Back shelter dusts the hut has fell
Trees that you hid in are now dead
Security lack slaves of trite acting
As masters remove this blinders
To gaze at the dusk and
Catch a olimpse of the dawn
Beliefs or convinctions
Clear evidence
We are all alone
