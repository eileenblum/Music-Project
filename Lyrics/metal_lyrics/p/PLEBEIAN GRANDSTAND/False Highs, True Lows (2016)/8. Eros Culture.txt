Exultation of split blood
As a sign of life
Turing slaughter into beauty fantasies
Of solemn hugs
Wish in vain
Miser ending hope at least for decency
Blame all arts for fallacy
Long battle fought as hero
Fell noble fall harsh
Landing void will strike
Cowardly made of flesh and bones
Composed of life organs and feelings
Signs of remorses and lies
Move life away until
Flies kiss the scarf
Sacrifice and ecstasy
Enjoyment and blasphemy
Eroticism and death
Your lover is absent
You weaken in seconds
Silly position
War and lies blaming life miser end
Sadistic animal asserting satanic presence
In the beautiful evil
In the good black inside white
Feces and grease blood and urine for all prestige
No medal for bravery
No honor for meat already
Blame all arts for fallacy hope
At least for decency
Sadistic animal asserting satanic presence
In the beautiful evil
In the good black inside white
