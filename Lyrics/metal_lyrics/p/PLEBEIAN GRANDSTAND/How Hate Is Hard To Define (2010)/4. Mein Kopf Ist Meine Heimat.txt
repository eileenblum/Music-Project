How wide is the winter Boredom
Beneath the moon
Have a bath in the Ether
Let myself go away
How shy is the ambiguous glow
Either rising or setting
I could catch a glimpse of the light
From the bewildered eyes
No matter how far I roam
Looking for a way out
To finally meet the inevitable
Spending time around meaning
Life as a common breathing
As a common flow
I could feel fluid thoughts
Coagulated into boredom
Black hearts are out of sight
Until I get droned
Hopeful black box
Keep boredom
Black hearts are out of sight
Until I get droned
Hopeful black box
Keep me up
I can't recognized you
Until I get DRONED
