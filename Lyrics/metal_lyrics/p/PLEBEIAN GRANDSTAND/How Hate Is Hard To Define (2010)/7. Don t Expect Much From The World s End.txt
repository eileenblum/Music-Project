Bleak preachers finding you bliss
Could you measure your own grave?
I will hear you out
As far as meaning is concerned
Early death surrounds us
Countdown is your fantasy's need
I've half a mind to give my last breath
Carry me with your wings
You don't want to see how empty your soul has become
Maybe I can enchanted an evil song
Where have you been all my life?
For what reasons would you grant my wishes?
