Swallow your so-called universal values
There is nothing to understand
The will of god will be done
What appears is good, what is good appear
I don't want to fall apart
And reach the point
Where truth becomes a moment false
Great life is a hoax!
Bring back memories of our utopian old dreams
What kind of narrow-minded are you?
What's keeping you awake?
I don't want to hear more
Negation of life has become visible
Necessity is socially dreamed
And the dream becomes necessary
