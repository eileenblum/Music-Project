I've been burned too many times
I won't be able to rise again
Cold ashes
A time to drift in the bliss
Don't be afraid
You've already cheated howling death one time
I don't mind if you take me down
Jump on the bandwagon
Go along with doubt
Let yourself go away
Contempt of vice for contempt of misfortune
How lucky you are
Time flies
Who have missed the rise toeards wisdom?
I hate the way I feel
I'll be the one that let you down
Possession is the ultimate Pain
This barren world doesn't belong to me
Just time to being called by the whispers of Mares
