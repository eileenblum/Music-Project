My sins are part of all that I have met
Setting eyes wide apart
Light impacts heading down
Your heart seems so aunaffected
And blurs my sights
Tonight I feel grave
I need time
To overcome daily worries
And hold back tears
All pure emotions gather you and lift you up
Impure emotion seizes only one side of your being
Away from the fear, life has a new meaning
Being in love with someone who hates himself
Becomes your ruin
