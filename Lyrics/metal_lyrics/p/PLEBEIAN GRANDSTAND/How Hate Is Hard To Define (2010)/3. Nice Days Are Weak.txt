Go away! There'll be no love lost
Your screams sound hollow
Your eyes remain dry
Remember how glad our mornings were
Each effor brings me closer to death
Lonely nights seem deeper
Acute pain as my only flavor
This casts a gloom over our lane
We have climbed over montains
Considering life as an event
Gloomy dusks predict the end
Looking to find calm down
Through this storm of passion
True love will never fade
Fight fear
Head-on
Standstill
Without looking back
Why did I still bear the brunt of your crying?
And I'll never sink
There is no end to the sky
Every night with a different shade black
I was walking through my fears
Head-on
This is what you here and why I will never know you
I will go out far from the shore in a blaze of glory
