Cold winds
on your blistered wings
Warm breath
from the light whispers
Random blades
Reckless givings
My limbs full of shivers
Split in infinite slivers

We all crave for life
Time to struggle and strife
We all look for signs
Meaning between the lines

Foes are rife with wars
Lost silences leave scars
Cowardice - the only sin

Floating in the breeze
Scared of joy
Daylight leaves me dazed
and blades stay fazed

Frost tears
Glazed eyes
Blind fears
Modern rise
