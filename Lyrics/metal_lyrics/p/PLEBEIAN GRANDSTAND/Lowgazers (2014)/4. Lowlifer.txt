Every part of you
Could freeze my senses
Tearing me up
The mass of oceans
Shattered visions
Recovering my wits
How my clenching hands ache
Silence is deafening
Tamer promises
Lay down and
Go beyond lies
Blossom
At the end of the rope

Lowlifer
Dawn bursts
Sharp thorns
Hope to linger
Just a second longer
Hazy goals
Drown your sorrow

Moonlit landscapes
Surrounded by will-o'-the-wisp
First breath in the gloom
Bury myself in
Endless mourning
