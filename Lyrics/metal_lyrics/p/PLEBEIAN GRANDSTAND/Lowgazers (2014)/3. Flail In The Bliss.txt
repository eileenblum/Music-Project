Flames loom so high
Dust and thunder
Blacken the horizon
and thrill
the daunted fears
Drawing one's sword

Diving into scum
Climbing the tide
Flows carry my plight

Holding hands
Break the spell
Sun has settled
Down the hill
While dew
Dispells doubts
One single tear
into the funeral urn

Back in those days
You drew on me
Gleams in your gaze
You drew on me

Hard to tame
Hard to blame
Marred
Hard to tame
