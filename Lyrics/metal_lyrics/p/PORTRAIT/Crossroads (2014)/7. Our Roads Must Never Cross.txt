Archonic avatar, how dare you speak your mind
Won't you ever heed the warnings from one who knows your kind
The lies you try to live by I saw through long ago
And as you wouldnât get it, I let the discord flow

Do you ever wonder what happened in your chest
And why your simple life turned into such a mess?
I tell you it was me who through this blessed blend
Took the process further, quickening your end

Our roads must never cross

O evil parasite, don't dare to block my path
The errors of your ways, are yet to face my wrath

Do you ever wonder what happened to your home
When standing at the crossroads with nowhere else to roam?
I tell you it was me who through this blessed blend
Took the matter further, hastening your end

Our roads must never cross

So stand aside poor shepherd for I have seen you through
And mark my words of warning, or I'll truly mess with you

You brood of human waste
Say can you feel the heat
The scorching flames behind you
Burning as you weep
I tell you it's my blood
A force of darksome fire
Quickening your end
A dream for you so dire

Our roads must never cross
