Sorcery conjuring ancient rites
Summoning the Goat of Hell
And a thousand young
Speaking the infernal names of hell
Reciting the words of evil
Morbid hymns of praise

Ageless rites
Ageless rites

Chanting endless repetitions
Formulas to bring forth the Beast into flesh
Darkness unholy presence a shadow of old
Black masses, Covenant of blood

Ageless rites
Ageless rites

Dark Lord!
Come forth!
Lead us
Into hell

Master - hear my invocations!
Awaiting your return, break the chains of scorn
Eternal years have passed since the fall
Endless cursed torment, yet still I hear Him call

Ageless rites
Ageless rites
