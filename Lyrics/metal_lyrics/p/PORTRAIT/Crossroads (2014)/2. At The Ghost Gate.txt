Oh you, who spoke my name
Elevated one, or lonely shade
So friendly, yet your voice sounded sly
Art thou trickster or ally?

I'm still blind to your shaded plane
Tied by the tyrant's veil
But your presence indeed let me know
That this was a victory in its own

Oh, how should I know
How to read your signs?
Come again now and speak on this night
Let me know your kind

By the fires of the underworld
And by the waters of death thou art called
Speak to me now once again
Come forth through the ghost gate

I beg you, who called my name
To reveal to me now why you came
And at this place where borders are thin
To your secrets obscure let me in

Oh, tell me how
Should I read your signs?
Come again now, appear on this night
Let me know your kind

By the fires of the underworld
And by the waters of death thou art called
Speak to me now once again
Come forth through the ghost gate

Oh, the shivers
As I stare into the void
What will I meet, will anything answer me
And will its stains bless or curse?

To these Crossroads I welcome you now
The ghost gate is open
Hear the call of the quick to the dead
Echo through the land... of bones

Oh, tell me how
Should I read your signs?
Come again now, return on this night
Let me know your kind
