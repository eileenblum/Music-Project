As we ventured to the land of the dead
To seek patronage of our ancestors
The ones who trod the paths before us long ago
And with whom we are as one

Oh the passion as we entered that place
And as the candle's flame led us further on
The hungry shades that prey within these
hunting grounds
Would not dare defy our cause

We were not alone
On that night the cross showed the line of our
Family divine
We were not alone
On that night of kinship and are in the circle
by the pine

As our voices burned with love and with joy
The signs then granted us were all so clear
We walked with them in circles
unbound by time
To receive their wondrous light
