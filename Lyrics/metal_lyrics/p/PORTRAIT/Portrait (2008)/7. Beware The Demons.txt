Deep inside, beyond your mind
There lies something you can not deny
Unconscious powers, your deepest fears
The screams of fright
Forever asleep but aware of your fears
Scheming your death as they drink your tears
The forces within, the spirits of the night

Midnight hour, they are closer now
Do not wake them up, do not call their names
Hungry for blood and your feeble soul
Their ghastly shriefs will drain your life 
The nightmare is real, for them you will kneel
They will fill the light

Do not ever try to defy
The spirits of darkness are right behind
The demons within - a force you can not deny

Beware the Demons - the dark sides of your soul
Beware the Demons - the faces of the unknown
Beware the Demons - they are blinding your eyes
Beware the Demons - the essence of your fright

When you decide to transcend this life 
They will still be there, to haunt you soul
Their dreadful cries will echo still, oh ohoh!
No, never will they fade and die
The sinister forces at your side
Forever present, asleep but alive
