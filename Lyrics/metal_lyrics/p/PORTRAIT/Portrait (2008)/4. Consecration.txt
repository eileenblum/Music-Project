By fire and water I conjure theeThat there remain within thy frameNo adverse thought nor enmity Blessed be thou cup of waterHear my will, attend to me. As my word, so mote it be Atham√©, black-hilted knifeI see your powers glowing so bright Blade of steel, bathed in seven seasBan such things as named by meShine through them, oh deadly foilSpill their blood upon earthly soilHear my will, attend to me. As my word, so mote it be Magic book of secret powersExorcised with water and fireThe pentacle and it runes are drawnWith these words of powerBook of words, book of deedsBlessed be thou book of art
