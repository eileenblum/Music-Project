Oh, I have seen the light
And all I wanted was to put it out
And I heard about peace, love and good
I felt like destroying it all, as soon as I understood.

So when offered the sacred blood of Jesus Christ
For once I spat in the cup
And for each time you prayed "save him"
I threw you spells, saying "piss in the eye of the lamb"

Holy father, I turned from you
Threw the cross into the fire
Your name I deny
May the kingdom, the power and glory be taken from thee
I close my eyes, now I dream of Hell

I've been walking for long
Through the valley of the shadow of death
Lucifer's light guiding me
On my path made of remains from people like you

I'd rather spend my eternity in a lake of fire
Than together with you
Praying sheep, stinking church rats, your empty smiles
Make me nauseous and eager to kill

Still no conscience, still no regrets after all that I've done
'Cause I've never felt anything but contempt and scorn
For this world and mankind
A human life is worth nothing to me

I've dreamt of sulphur spheres 
Where black's the lightest nuance
And I've seen you suffer there
In anguish. In tormenting void
And each night, in the rivers of all-consuming fire

And that fire remains within me wherever I walk
All my hate is but love for the Lord
My tongue's cloven like the snakes, sharp as the sword
With which the lambs shall be slaughtered 
To water the soil with holy blood

Walk into me, wander beyond the grace of god
Into starless nights
Soon to enter, the kingdom of shadows in abyssal grave
Wield your knives, fight for what is wrong!
