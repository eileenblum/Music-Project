The world will end in fire, I've seen in in my dreams
His wrathful mighty flames around us you'll see
You'll never escape my vengeance; nor that of Satan
By blood of your sons we shall thrive forever

An urge to go beyond life down eternity's depths
With pain and pleasure I fall to my knees
Blesses by sulphur fires, I sold my soul
Forever I ride the serpent 
To the Devil a son

Bow unto the Devil, fall to your knees
Bleed for the devil, pray with the beast

A shadowed inner self, a soul bleeding strong
At which the pentagram points
And lead my way home
I seek the tree of life for Ouroboro's kiss
The third eye of wisdom to open I urge

The tranquil of the Nightside soon awaits for me
For the world will end in fire as I sail Charon's sea
