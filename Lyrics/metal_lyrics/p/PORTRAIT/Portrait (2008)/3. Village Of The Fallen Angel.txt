We're all doomed
That's what the old ones say
The old people in the village by the hangman's bay
Though centuries of time, from generation to generation
The legend has lived on
The legend of the fallen angel

His eyes will burn a hole in the souls of those who leave
His claws will take the lives of those who try
Every seventh year, a virgin must be given
Every seventh year they sacrifice
And if they should avoid the sacrificial rite
They're all doomed to burn in Hell

Oh mighty angel, we drain this life of thee
We drink the wine of wisdom and eternal liberty
Let your mighty darkness be the torch of our lives 
Let us find our way, our path through your light

The few who dared to try, the brave ones the defied
Was never more seen alive
The results of their quest; examples of the past
Examples of what follows sinful deeds
To every little child, the stories told,
The stories about the fallen angel's light

Oh mighty angel, we drain this life of thee
We drink the wine of wisdom and eternal liberty
Let your mighty darkness be the torch of our lives 
Let us find our way, our path through your light
