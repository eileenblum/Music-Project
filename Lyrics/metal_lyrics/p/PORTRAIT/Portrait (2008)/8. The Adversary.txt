I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God
I won't obey, I won't bow down
My desire was not to serve, nor to please
Oh creator, in any life, there is my seed

Father who art in Hell; hallowed be thy name
II give you my life, my devotion
And promise to destroy those of others

Written in blood, in soil and fire, your name
Whispered by the storms
So feared, so hated

I have burnt my tongue
Praising every sign of your presence
Thy every will is the same as mine
Spoken out loud by every leader
Chained, bound to our destiny
Carved in the heart of every soul
That hatred brought its shape

Ascend, oh Morningstar, shine your light on us
Oh great Adversary, bringer of the end

I'll ascend above the heights of the clouds
I will be like the most high
Bow unto me, for so you've done, through all your lives
I'm the saviour you'll turn unto in this end of time

Oh Morningstar, who fell from heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Ancient serpent, end of beginnings, beginning of the end
Prophet come, guide my hand, light my path
So that I can be your noblest servant

Ascend, oh Morningstar, shine your light on us
Oh great Adversary, bringer of the end
