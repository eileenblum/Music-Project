Night sky is calling, unveiling itself as a flash for our eyes. Oh hungry night, brighter now than ever before. 
I see them riding, those we've fed since the dawn of time, and side by side. No sea can quench the thirst in their eyes.
How life shall cease on this your night, oh storm of might!
A dreadful sight, for those that can't sense the light. Unholy night, naught shall still the thirst in your eyes. 
Something's howling in the shadows. Can you feel they are near?
Something is yearning in the shadows now, they must be closer now. And at the time between the time, we shall hear them howl.
Oh storm of might, how life shall cease on this your night. The seeds we've sown tonight you reap, as we rejoice.
