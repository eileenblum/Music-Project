Behold the crimson skies. No in deep red we are painting your paradise. We walk among you. In a land where all there's to us is the pleasure of your fall, oh sweet ending of it all!
Let battle now commence. Let's behold your true colours and welcome the ending of your days. And a sign to come, after all our prayers. Nothing's gonna be alright. Hear the screams in the night!
The passion burns with evil. The passion dwells in shadows.
Ruined, devastated lies the once great house of God. Here our Master's dwelling. Here is praised the INFERNAL MAJESTY. Lifeless stare the eyes now of the grand creation's crown. For our god has horns, and his kingdom shall forever be.
Watch your children die, with their empty eyes wide open, gazing at the golden shores. Plague spreading 'round you. Our swords are the deadly menace and mark our every word, the worst is yet to come!
