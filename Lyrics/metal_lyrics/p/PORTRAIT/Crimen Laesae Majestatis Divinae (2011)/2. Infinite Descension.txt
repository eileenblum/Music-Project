Come little child float into my damnation. Swallow my venomous spit so that you can see. We fall and fall in the shape of bleak abominations. I descend forever, befriend now the darkness that took me. 
The foundation's begun to tremble and shake. For each crime I commit the more I awake. Some see a heart of stone, I see stone walls collapsing. And floods of blood sipping through the barrier from the other side, to stain a murderer's path.
When you fell from heaven's heights, the blood they cried was like mine. And like that of the sacrifice to the ever shining light.
Through the cracks I can see hope ride on devil wings. For in the kingdom of the damned the dead is king. ENEMY OF FAITHFULS, amidst your sphere I fall. My poisoned dagger gleams, I wish the death of all. 
Into the abyss I yearn, depravation is my crown. As eyes are plucked out, as on his altar flesh is laid down. Souls of children thrown into the great cold dark. Our hungry void like a gape just waiting to consume. 
Your earthly breed unto your chains eternally condemned, can't fight the tumour that is me and thousands alike. For your ways are watched by the evil eye. Only peace found is in the dirt to eternal lie.
You were a stone, oh you were a foundation. Leaving a hole now the crown of its creation. You got to learn the true saviour is the one to wield the scythe. You got to see the most prosperous sight is no sight. You got to see the peace to be found in the eternal dead night.
