I fly through the icy skies this night. I behold mourning trees and landscapes full of sorrow. The pale, grey future of man (an all forgotten tomorrow).
Leafs are falling as they burn, reinforcing suffocation. Their cries for help so weak, the sounds of damnation.
Seek the face of the LORD, for you cannot see him and live. Aim for that than which no greater can be thought. And I shall bind you, not in death, but in life. Chained you will be for for what will seem an eternity. The shores of hopelessness, unified with life's worthlessness. The distant horizon...its hunger ever present. I am its medium, and my words shall burn the heart of the world. 'I die, therefore I am!'
Constant prayers are heard, but noone will ever answer. The empty graves are calling. Can't you hear their laughter?
