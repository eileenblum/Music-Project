Your evil fantasies can be reality
The power of the mind can realize
You could make it happen
Just close your eyes
All you have to do is fantasize
As you wish so shall it be
As you wish your fantasy
Watch what you wish for, you just might get it
Calling out on death can bring an early end
Choose your words so carefully
Ah, to be alone. And look ! The world is gone
You can't bring it back
Too late, you see !!
Call for a lover
Change the day to night
You've got the power
Watch what you wish for, you just might get it
I know what's there behind your eyes
Watch what you wish for, you just might get it
The power's there to realize

HEAVY METAL HEART

The beast is out tonight
Don't touch be careful it bites
A feast of many hands
There's no second chance
Beware the metal heart
Heavy metal heart
Built of ice and steel
Black night reptilian real
beware of each step you take
Cos it's bone that breaks
Beware the metal heart
Heavy metal heart
