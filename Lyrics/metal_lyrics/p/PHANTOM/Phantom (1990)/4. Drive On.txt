One more night gotta drag myself
From depths of a dreamless sleep
Wrench my brain from another realm
body to a stagger on its own two feet
Under ten minutes cut it to the wire
Blood pumping back in my veins
Senses back engine on
fight out in the lanes
Drive on - gotta push it past the limit
No I'm too far gone
Drive on fast enough to kill you
Will I ever see it done
Metro cup on his way to the hole
Driving by doing 105
Black in the back hands cuffed tight
Stark silhouette hard orange light
45 minutes - 45 miles
All the same you see
White lines racing by so many miles
Going down - Lord help me
Drive on - pushing past the limit
No I'm too far gone
Drive on - fast enough to kill you
Will I ever make it home
All the days turn into nights
The nights turn into days
Alltogether out of phase
Every single night a danger
Every single night another try
Taking my time and chances
Forever ask why
Drive on - pushing past the limit
No I'm too far gone
Drive on - fast enough to kill you
Will I ever make it home
Drive on Drive on Drive on
