Sidewalk messiahs sluttering the street
Calling for a sigh
Doling out salvation to wolves the rotted meat
Damn you for all time
You got me nailed down
Kneel and pray
Sidewalk Messiah - Sidewalk Messiah
Call for sacrifice
Hellfire preacher - derision on display
Blood &amp; Sacrifice
Black hearted city - altar of decay
Babylon doth rise
You got me nailed down
Kneel &amp; pray
As the blind lead the blind
They call out for sacrifice
Sidewalk Messiah - sidewalk Messiah
Sidewalk Messiah - call for sacrifice
You got me nailed down
Kneel &amp; pray
My Kingdom come
My will be done
