Dark eyes she don't need the light
Come stealing through the night
Feel it everywhere - evil's in the air
The hell is in her eyes
My sin is her delight
You evilize everything you touch
You evilize
Carnivore for blood you lust
With a swift and savage thrust
Feel it everywhere magic's in the air
The hell is in her eyes
My sin is her delight
You evilize everything you touch
You evilize - I'm loving it too much
You evilize - you got me hypnotized
You evilize come on and hold me tight
Feel it everywhere - evil's in the air
The hell is in her eyes
My sin is her delight
You evilize everything you touch
You evilize - I'm lovin' it too much
You evilize - caught in your spell
You evilize - take me straight to hell
