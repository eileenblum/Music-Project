A killer clown with silver dollar eyes
is calling out my name
Handing out balloons for the price of a life
Inviting me down the drain
A carnival of souls swirling down below
A calliope of pain
Where a dead man nailed to a painted horse
rides round again
We all float down here
We all float down here - in the dead pool
You'll float too my dear - in the dead poolat
That painted smile taunting in the dark
Like blood washed in the rain
Signaling to me - he giggles as he waves
It's starting once again
Floating face down in the wishing well
In boxes underground
The killer clown with the silver dollar eyes
Reaching up to pull me down - we all float .....
Come and play come to stay
Come and play come to stay
It's your dying day
We all float down here in the dead pool
You'll float too my dear in the dead pool
You'll float too in boxes underground
