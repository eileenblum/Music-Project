In the night they're coming for me
In the night I can see their shadows on the wall
Hear the call
Nightmares
Under the eaves and below the stair
Don't dare look cos they're always there
Waiting for the night that's to fall
I can hear them out in the hall
Oh.
The rise above the bed where I lie
Nightmares
Technicolor Nightmares
Nightmares
Oh - rising above the bed where I lie
Out of the window and into the night
Nightmares
Technicolor Nightmares
Nightmares
