The season of sorrow
The blank stares of horror
As they tear at the children
Blood stains the Land
There's no sense in fighting
What can't be subsided
The world as once we've known is at an end
Now the wolves are at the door
The wolves are at the door
Beware the red Moon
A fiery eye in black gloom
Screaming his tale of vengeance and war
The rivers shall run red
And those who are not dead
Will weep and will pray "Father we're lost &amp; alone"
Now the wolves are at the door
The wolves are at the door
The silence of sorrow
The bleak no tomorrow
As the wolves at last crash through the door.
Hear the wolves are at the door
Hear the wolves are at the door
