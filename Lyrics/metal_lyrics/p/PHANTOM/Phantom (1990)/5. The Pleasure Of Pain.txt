In the dead of night
I hear the whispered cry
of the tale - they softly sing
of the suffering
Beware the hunger
Shining in their eyes
Love in vein - the pleasure of pain
Lacey curtains wave
To the wind in vain
In slow motion silently
I'm drawn back again
Beware the hunger
Evil in her eyes
And as my soul is drawn
I hear the darkness moan
Love in vein - the pleasure of pain
A lover dies
With the settin sun
Gathering in the dark
The ending has begun
Beware the hunger
Burning my eyes
Each night I shall return
My love the touch that burns
