[Buckland, Green]

Madmen know whereof the story is told
Children see what can't be seen by the old
Take my hand I'll show

Here comes the night and the light of the day
Long gone the shaman of old
Listen to silence and hear what it says
Down in the well of souls

Whispers call to us in the night
Listen with your heart and see with your mind
Take my hand and fly

Here comes the night and the light of the day
Long gone the shaman of old
Listen to silence and hear what it says
Down in the well of souls

Here in the well they can take you to hell
Down in the world far below
Or raise you to heaven where you can tell
You passed through the well of souls
