[Green, Buckland]

Evil mischievers, purveyors of sin
Metal messiahs damned to the end

Vampiric prelates, cardinals of cain
Bones in your closet, your pestilent kin

We writhe as we rock as we spin as we roll
By the light of the moon we lose all control
Alive and well and wicked as sin

Caustic and christless, best at their worst
The new unreligion, the electric church

Merchants of madness, plague dealers of old
Gangrenous, godless... the wolf in the fold

We writhe as we rock as we spin as we roll
By the light of the moon we lose all control
Alive and well and wicked as sin

We are the nightbreed revelling in pain
Tortured and tangled, still I remain!!!

We writhe as we rock as we spin as we roll
By the light of the moon we lose all control
Alive and well and wicked as sin!!!
