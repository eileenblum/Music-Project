[Green, Buckland, Taylor]

As the night creeps up the stairs
Don't forget to say your prayers
All day long you didn't care, now say your prayers
Good night !

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
There's something there just out of sight

Say your prayers

You never feared death in the light
You only dwelt on it come night
Now your life wans in full sun

Say your prayers

What lurks in the shadows
Under eaves, below stairs
Just waiting for the night to fall !

They reach out from below the stairs

So don't forget to say your prayers

All day long you didn't care

Now say your prayers
