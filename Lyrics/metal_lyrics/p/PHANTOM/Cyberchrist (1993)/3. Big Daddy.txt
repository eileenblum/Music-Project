[Kohn, Green, Buckland, Taylor]

To the crack of bone, the whip of spine
I built my throne to drink my wine
 From the skulls of enemies, their eyes stud my crown
The brave live in fear of me
Fools lie underground!

Come wrap yourself around big daddy
Or take a long nap underground

I take delight in my dark abode
With skin so white
Your blood runs cold into the chalice
Your sacrifice, my gain
You came called to me by the sibilance in your brain!

Come wrap yourself around big daddy
Come to me and lie face down
Indide out and upside down
Keep your head spinning 'round

I lick your lips
Surreal, obscene
The grinds, the slips
Now head down, lean

Tongue tied and twisted you know you'll come around
Admit you really missed it
Now scream, I love that sound

Come wrap yourself around big daddy
Come to me and lie face down
Indide out and upside down
Keep your head spinning 'round
