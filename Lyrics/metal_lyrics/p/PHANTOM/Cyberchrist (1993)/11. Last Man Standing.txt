[Buckland, Green]

Ruler of ruins, lord of the waste
The silent warrior falls
Leprous and rotted, liege of the dead
King of these crumbled walls

The last man standing
Crowned lord of the dead

Scabrous battalions climb from the pit
The slaughtered rise again
Fortress no refuge
In bitter times
Worms twist in your head

The last man standing
Is crowned lord of the dead
