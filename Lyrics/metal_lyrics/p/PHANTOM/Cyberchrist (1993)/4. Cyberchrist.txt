[Buckland, Green]

Blinded, crucified, left out here for dead
Rising rectified
The circuits glowing red

Sanctus, sanctus
Dieu mundi
Vox exterminans we call for you

Kneel and pray
Don't pass this way
Cyberchrist draws near
Kneel and pray
Don't pass this way
Cyberchrist is here

I, god I machine
Unbroken on the wheel
Metal messiah
The undestroyed, now kneel!

Sanctus, sanctus
Dieu mundi
Sanctus, sanctus
Carpe noctem
Vox exterminans we call on you
Kneel and pray
Don't pass this way
Cyberchrist draws near
Kneel and pray
Don't pass this way
Cyberchrist is here

Cyberchrist, cyberchrist
