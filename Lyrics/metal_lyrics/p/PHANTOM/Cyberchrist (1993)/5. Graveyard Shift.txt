[Green, Taylor, Buckland]

I can see by the look in your eyes you
don't believe in me
But revealed just before you die
Trust in what you see

Feel that you're paralyzed as you drain to white
It's been there all this time, that dark playe in your mind

Graveyard shift by the light of the moon

I am here behind your closet door
You dare not speak my name
Don't close your eyes, it won't work anymore
It's always been the same

Feel that you're paralyzed as you drain to white
It's been there all this time, that dark playe in your mind

Graveyard shift by the light of the moon
