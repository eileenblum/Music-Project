[Taylor, Buckland, Green, Borsellega]

I saw the stars fall from the sky
Crashing all around
Feel the flame steal my eyes
Vaporize the ground

Red lines flashing
World is crashing

Red alert, red alert, code psycho zoo !

Thunder roars across the sea
A child cries alone
On a crumbled street with glass in his feet
He dies with shattered bones

Red lines flashing
God, we're crashing

Red alert, red alert, code psycho zoo !

Storm clouds gather, nothing matters now

The drums all stop, the flags all burn
In a silent night
The smoke filled air swirls and turns
No "Into glory, ride!"

Redrum, redrum
In the asylum

Red alert, red alert, code psycho zoo !
