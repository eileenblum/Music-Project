[Tylor, Green]

Feeding off the old lies of the new world
Casting off and spinning in a rage
Teeth bared for biting as the spring winds
Claw, crash and rattle in the cage

Down, down, down
You'll be six feet under

Kick and scream as worms feed on your brain
Living off the misery and pain

Down, down, down
You'll be six feet under
