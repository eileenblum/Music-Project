[Taylor, Green, Buckland, Borsellega]

Catch the twist
Severed wrist
Ride the crimson tide

Strike the chime
Sing the rhyme
Dead men never lie

Kingdoms rise, fall
She stands like stone
Hail, all hail, the queen of the damned

Cast to crime
The coffered dime
The jester on the throne

Tip the crown
Feel you drown
Crucify your own

Restless aparition
Eyes that never slept
A long held lost tradition
Those who once were kept

Kingdoms rise, fall
She stands like stone
Hail, all hail, the queen of the damned

Burn and crisp
Cry and twist
Telekinetic char

Crack the bone
Touch the stone
The queen of styggia
