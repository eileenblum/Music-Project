Something to remember
On this bitter winter's night
An escape from your fate
The beginning of the fight

Your razor was your comfort
In your life in the cell
Another way out
You knew all to well

Your days in endless sorrow
Your nights filled with pain
Memories of loved ones
Slowly drove you insane

Redemption was elusive
A dream and a temptation
Until you took the chance
And bid for salvation

[Chorus:]
Run now
Into the night into the light
Of freedom and a chance
To live again.

Run now
Into the light into the night
Of freedom and a chance
To live again.

Forsaken and forgotten
As you slipped into the dark
A figure once begotten
Of a hardened, broken heart

"When the morning comes" you cried,
"I'll be a brand new man"
"Not the one who succumbs
"To someone else's plan."

[Chorus:]
Run now
Into the light into the night
Of freedom and a chance
To live again.

Run now
Into the light into the night
Of freedom and a chance
To live again.
