It's insatiable
Going into overdrive
It's a revolution
Of the spirit

I'm fully able
I finally feel alive
It's a liberation
Can you feel it?

I found my open road
Destination unknown
Out on my open road
One I'll take until I die

[Chorus:]
Followâ¦
Followâ¦
Come with me
Taking every day
Doing it my way
Come with me

Without a thought
I grab the reigns
I'll change my course
And thrash it up

In the end I know
It's me against the world
It's my time now
This feeling burns inside

I found my open road
Destination unknown
Out on my open road
One I'll take until I die

[Chorus:]
Followâ¦
Followâ¦
Come with me
Taking every day
Doing it my way
Come with me

I found my open road
Destination unknown
Out on my open road
One I'll take until I die

[Chorus:]
Followâ¦
Followâ¦
Come with me
Seizing every day
Throwing care away
Rise with me

Destination unknown,
Uncharted road never shown
The only way to set me free
