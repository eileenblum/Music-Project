[Instrumental intro]

[Acoustic]
Thrice, I walked this path of destitute alone
My heart sinks like a heavy anvil
I arrived too late, nearly redefined
To lure the muses through the unbridled stone.

As I sit here to ponder what is right
I wonder what sorrows 'morrow will bring
When I close my eyes tonight
Will I feel this bitter night's sting?

[Heavy]
It's Midnight in this land of Darkness
As the serpents slither out of their holes
And somewhere amongst the rotting corpses
My fallen brothers' battle cry calls.

The Warrior's Oath I once knew
In Hades realm I will recite it
But now in Constantinople
I alone lead the righteous few.

I bid thee farewell now, forever
To fight the Ottoman hordes
Aside the Orthodox faithful
My bond on this realm do I sever.

As the mothers mourn their beloved sons
Come tomorrow will Hagia Sophia still stand?
Will I hear the prayers of the nuns?
Will there be a city left to defend?

I hear the raindrops drain the night
I see the stars clash with might
The trees whisper with fright
As misery clouds my sight

[Chorus:]
City of God, City of Light
Constantinople
Brave New Rome, show your might
Constantinople
To defend we fight!

Like a raging wildfire these questions plague me
As (the) enemies canons blast the walls
Raping the women, slaying the elderly
Before my eyes Constantinople falls.

Church bells echo throughout the land
On this black Tuesday, 1453
As emperor Palaeologos makes his stand
All of Christendom we fight to free.

With glory's reins do I ride
Across this empty Hippodrome
Through the great Blachaernaen Gates
With steed and steel held high.

I won't look back taunted by fear
While in my dark veins blood still flows
As the Turkish hordes draw near
If we'll survive the night, only the Lord knowsâ¦

As the sun settles in the East
The legions of Death feast
As the Dead to Hades enlist
The Hellenes battle on the Turk beast.

[Chorus:]
City of God, City of Light
Constantinople
Brave New Rome, show your might
Constantinople
To defend we fight!

As the sun settles in the East
The legions of Death feast
As the Dead to Hades enlist
The Hellenes battle on the Turk beast.

[Chorus:]
City of God, City of Light
Constantinople
Defending Europe and her honor
Constantinople
Like the Phoenix will rise again!

[Instrumental outro]
