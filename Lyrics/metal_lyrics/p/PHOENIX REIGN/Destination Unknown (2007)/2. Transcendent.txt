I'm consumed and overwhelmed
This madness is devastating me
I'm all alone
Inside this hell of torment and despair
Abused by the elements I have no control of
(Let me go, let me go)

I'm about to go down this time,
But I can't, I'm much too strong
Too much a warrior

[Chorus:]
I will never be defeated by your injustice
By a hand of doom or an act of God
I will rise up, I will transcend
In this tomb that I now dwell
Deaf and blind to the world around me
In my bitter cage
You have built with lies to keep me
From the truth, but I won't be denied any longer
You are the poison, I am the cure
A remedy to this calamity
Your death my design

[Chorus:]
I will never be defeated by your injustice
By a hand of doom or an act of God
I will rise up, I will transcend
What was once my haven
Has become an abyss
Full of dark stagnation
Memories of former bliss
With this innocence so fleeting
Like a fantasy
Who is safe anymore?

[Chorus:]
I will never be defeated by your injustice
By a hand of doom or an act of God
I will rise up, I will transcend
