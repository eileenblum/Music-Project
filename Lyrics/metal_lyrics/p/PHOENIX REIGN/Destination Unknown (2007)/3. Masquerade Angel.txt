This dread that I feel now
On this crimson twilight
Means the end is near
I feel it coming onâ¦
The crowd is calling to me
"Come and join us!"
But he's ready to deceive
While dressed to pretend
Forever bound to him
He's possessed my senses
And I can't break out of
His spell.
His music draws me in
Someone save me
Before I've lost my
Mind to this game
This is only the start
Scene one draws, you play the part in it all
The dance of destiny, you can't break free
The masquerade calls for you

[Chorus:]
Masquerade Angel
You're a devil in disguise

On the run from this
Unholy madness
We've passed that point
Of no return

The crowd was calling to me
"Come and join us"
But I can't, he's
Calling for my blood
This is only the start
Scene one draws, you play the part in it all
The dance of destiny, you can't break free
The masquerade calls for you

[Chorus:]
Masquerade Angel
You're a devil in disguise

Did you ever believe in something
Only to have it taken away?
If you follow his delusions
It'll happen all over again

[Chorus:]
Masquerade Angel
You're a devil in disguise
