When I look into your eyes
The power bleeds in me
Forces pull me closer
To lead another way

Open your eyes
Tears are gone
Open your heart
Shed no more

[Chorus:]
I got this power inside
It makes me see
I try to fight
To make it through this time
Show me the magic that you hold
Pull me closer, I need to feel again

Opposition holds me back
They try and bring me down
To win I'll use the strength
I feel when seeing you

Open your eyes
Tears are gone
Open your heart
Shed no more

[Chorus:]
I got this power inside
It makes me see
I try to fight
To make it through this time
Show me the magic that you hold
Pull me closer, I need to feel again

When your grip is lost one me
The power drains, you see
Spells pull me further
To fall into the fray

Open your eyes
Draw me in
Open your heart
I need you now

[Chorus:]
I got this power inside
It makes me see
I try to fight
To make it through this time
Show me the magic that you hold
Pull me closer, I need to feel again
To feel again
