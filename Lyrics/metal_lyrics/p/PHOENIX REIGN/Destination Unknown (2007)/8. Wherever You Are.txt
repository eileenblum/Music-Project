There is no reason
We should stand alone
Counting falling stars
Under the moonlit sky

As dark night whispers
For your warm embrace
This frail heart sings and speaks to me
And I see your smiling face

So many memories
Share you and I
Our first kiss dances
Through my mind

And though my heart
Alone will die
Your entrancing eyes,
They still light my sky

[Chorus:]
I looked away, my heart said no
I fell astray, to an angel's love
No goodbyes, wherever you are
Your emerald eyes are from Heaven above
Your emerald eyes are from Heaven above

There is no reason
For our love's denial
No compromise sooths
My heart's lament

In this tragic world
Only you make sense
I need you now
Don't leave me in suspense.

[Chorus:]
I looked away, my heart said no
I fell astray, to an angel's love
No goodbyes, wherever you are
Your emerald eyes are from Heaven above
Your emerald eyes are from Heaven above
