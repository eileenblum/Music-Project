Forgotten times
Forgotten words
I breathe your name
To live again
With you, possessed
I'm in your depths
And I'm in chains
To your memory

Tell me why do my dreams resound
With your words and deeds I've tried to drown
Wondering, struggling, fighting
To reclaim my life

[Chorus:]
When I've reached the end
Looking back upon it all
I'll know that I was so alone
Forgetting all about you

Forgotten days
Unending nights
I've played this game
Longer than the rain
I dream your eyes
And I bleed your lies
Forever in chains
To you memory

All your spells that well up in me
They bring me into darkness, now
My mind it aches sore
Not innocent, something more

[Chorus:]
When I've reached the end
Looking back upon it all
I'll know that I was so alone
Forgetting all about you
