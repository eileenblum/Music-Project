You live your life in cemented walls
If you keep yourself closed off you're gonna fall
It feels like this day could be your last
But a change is coming soon and it's coming fast

[Chorus:]
You gotta keep breathing
This breath isn't your last yet
You gotta keep breathing
Play this as your biggest bet
You gotta keep breathing
These challenges you've always met
You gotta keep breathing
That's all you gotta do, you're set

This never ending nightmare
Is over now.

Always seems, just beyond your reach
Standing fast at a wall you're trying to breach
you're scared, despaired but there's hope
As long as you're alive, there's still hope (there's still hope)

[Chorus:]
You gotta keep breathing
This breath isn't your last yet
You gotta keep breathing
Play this as your biggest bet
You gotta keep breathing
These challenges you've always met
You gotta keep breathing
That's all you gotta do, you're set

This never ending nightmare
Is over now.

It's time for moving on
You've gotta let it go
No need for holdin' on.

It's over now
It's all over now
