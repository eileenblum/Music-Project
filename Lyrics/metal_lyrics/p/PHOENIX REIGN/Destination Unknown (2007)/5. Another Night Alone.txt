I hear the calling of the wine dark sea,
as lightning rips the sky
reflections in the waves speak of you and me
for the heavens cannot lie.

I feel the pressure weighing in on me
blotting out my light.
That's the price, my nightly fee
that I wrestle every night.

There's no sea too deep to drown my misery
like a hammer the sky falls.
It's a cold night, I don't wanna leave,
But, that's how my fate rolls.

I hear the howling of the wretched outcasts
That toil in the dunes
All those that cast away their lots
As love demised their fortunes.

Darkness stares me down, another night alone
prisoner for life, free alone to roam.

Alone I drift asleep, drown in misery
reflecting on my life, dream of you and me.

[Chorus:]
I can't stand - Another night alone
I can't stand - Another night alone
I can't stand - Another night aloneâ¦

I hear the calling of the Sirens begging me
to jump in their abyss.
Their hypnotic song to set my heart free,
if I give in to their kiss.

I hunger for your sweet and loving voice
And that is the truth
I've made a careless foolish choice
My pain is my proof.

There's no sea too deep to drown my misery
like a hammer the sky falls.
I see no light, just shades of gray
as melancholy calls.

I hear the calling of the wine dark sea,
as thunder blazes high
reflections in the waves speak of you and me
of a love not meant to die.

Where do I go if we aren't right
When I can't even face the morning light?

How can you not glance in my heart
Put up a better fight so we'd never part?

[Chorus:]
I can't stand - Another night alone
I can't stand - Another night alone
I can't stand - Another night aloneâ¦
