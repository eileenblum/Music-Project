The days are now getting darker
Maybe tomorrow it has arrived
And this holy war has come to an end
The time for regret is getting closer
Somehow I knew we would lose this fight
So as the sun goes down, so does life

We are all condemned

Why do people cling to life
When we know that we canï¿½t live forever

The lives and dreams getting weaker
Itï¿½s only hope that keeps me alive
I thought this holocaust had come to an end
The scent of death now surrounds me
But like the seasons I will be back
Because I refuse to leave this pain this hell

We are all condemned

Why do people cling to life
When we know that we canï¿½t live forever
