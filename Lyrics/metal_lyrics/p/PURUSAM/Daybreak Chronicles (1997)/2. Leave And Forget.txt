The sun rises to form another day
Another day that will end the same as yesterday
And we'll be standing there without a single thing to say

We tend to allow our past destroy our future
And pretend that some things will last
Although we know

Reminded by the once so distant time
We make it once again and dig a grave of our mistakes

We tend to allow our past destroy our future
And pretend that some things will last
Although we know that time will flow
Regret will grow
Leave and forget the past as yesterday

As days flows the moments slowly fades
So now the minutes waits to take another day away

We tend to allow our past destroy our future
And pretend that some things will last
Although we know that time will flow
Regret will grow
Leave and forget the past as yesterday
