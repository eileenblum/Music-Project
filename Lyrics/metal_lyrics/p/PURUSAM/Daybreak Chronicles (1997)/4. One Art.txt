Paint me a picture of the things that hides behind that smile
Make me a sculpture of something
Just something that helps to find
The meaning of all the meanings I see
Are they really what they were meant to be
Or is this painting just the things I want them to be

Like the last thing I see as I slowly fall asleep

How do we know which way is right
Unless we observe for ourselves
How do we know which things we find
Unless we observe for ourselves

Write me a poem with some words as beauty as a mind
Tell me a story about the princess
Who gets saved by the knight
That illustrates your imagination
And describes the very essence of life
Paint me a picture that shows me true beauty inside

How do we know which way is right
Unless we observe for ourselves
How do we know which things we find
Unless we observe for ourselves

Like the last thing I feel as morning comes to me

How do we know which way is right
Unless we observe for ourselves
How do we know which things we find
Unless we observe for ourselves
