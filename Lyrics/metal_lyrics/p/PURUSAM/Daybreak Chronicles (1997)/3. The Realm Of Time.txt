Sometimes life is ticking away
Sometimes there is no reason left to stay
And sometimes it's beauty like never before

We will never appreciate it
No one that loves or hates it
No one that cares at all

Time flow like a river
And history repeats
A life is an eternity

Sometimes it's a wonderful dream
Sometimes life is as beautiful as mean
Just like before

We will never appreciate it
No one that loves or hates it
No one that cares at all

Time flow like a river
And history repeats
A life is an eternity
