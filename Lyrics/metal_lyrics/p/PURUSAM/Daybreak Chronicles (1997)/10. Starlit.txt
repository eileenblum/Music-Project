Over the edge of day and on into the night
Heading away for where the secrets lies
All those dreams of a better world
Gets crushed down as we want more
It's starlit now but not for so much longer

Over the cloudy sky, afraid in bright daylight
What lies ahead no one surely know
So we'll turn the airship into dust
Say a prayer that in God we trust
It's starlit now but not for so much longer

[Chorus:]
What takes a lifetime to create
Takes a moment to destroy

Next time we'll do it right, no regrets and no painful cries
We'll discover what no one has before
All those dreams of another world
Falls asleep as we gets to know
Why it's starlit, and why one shines more than the others

[Chorus]

Turning my face away, don't want to see it
Turning my sense away, don't want to feel it

[Chorus]
