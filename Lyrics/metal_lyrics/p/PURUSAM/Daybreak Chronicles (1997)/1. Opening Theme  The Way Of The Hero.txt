"As the sun cracked in the dawning east, the mighty trees danced in the humble wind. And as the day grew older, stormy clouds raged upon the starlit sky and the sound of war could now be heard in every corner of the worldï¿½ the thousand years old prophecy of the last daybreak had now come to it's beginning.

A sellsome dream was sent to the one who was born in the moon and the sun to guide the mighty airship along with the people from the city of Relm away from the burning fire and into new horizons."
