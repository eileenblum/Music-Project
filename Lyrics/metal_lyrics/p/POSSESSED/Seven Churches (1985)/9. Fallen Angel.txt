[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Deceiving angel full of hate
Outcasts will rebel
Below the crust, the dark kingdom
Also known as Hell

Fallen angel distrusts God
Exiled down below
His burning lust to power all
Starts his own domain

Poisoned minds
Evil plague
Wicked shrines
Where you beg
Merciless
Angel fell
Soul won't rest
Into Hell

Flames of fury burning hot
Glowing in his eyes
Down below forever rot
Until his soul can rise

Hellsent souls become his slaves
Working against all
Bringing pain the master raves
Lucifer they call

Poisoned minds
Evil plague
Wicked shrines
Where you beg
Merciless
Angel fell
Soul won't rest
Into Hell

[Solos: Mike, Larry]
