[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Holy Hell, death to us
Satan's fell, unholy lust
Devil's water starts to flood
God is slaughtered, drink his blood

Our bonding, trust is at hand
Go we must, to Satan's land
Pray for death, and cry for life
Reaper's breath will breathe new life

Satan's child, he is born
And to death he is sworn
Days of hate, and days of pain
Endless term of Satan's reign

Endless dreams, in the night
Eternal sleep, eternal fright
Defiled crosses, oh black mass
Satan's reigns, me at last

[Solo: Larry]

All of Heaven, all of earth
You'll meet your god
Chained to torment, chained to pain
Like a dog

Evil days and evil nights
Are black as death
Hearts of sinners, hearts of stone
Reaper's breath

There was blood and there was pain
Ecstacy
Rage of magic, rage of witches
Sorcery

Feel the power, feel the heat
Down Below
Kill the people, kill them dead
Take their soul

Blackened masses, blackened crosses
Ritual
Cut the heads, cut the throats
Take the fall
