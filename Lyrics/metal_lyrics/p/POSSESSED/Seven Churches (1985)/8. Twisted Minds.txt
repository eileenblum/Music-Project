[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Twisting my mind, insane
Ripping our your brain, you're slain
Grieving the sunset, terror
And your last breath is nearer

Revenge

Draining your soul out, bloodless
Awaiting the final sentence
Grasping your last piece of mind
Slip into madness, our kind

Revenge

Life is strange, it's one big game
Live or dead, it's all the same
Hidden secrets inside my head
Decaying bodies, my blade is red

Rotting world, so full of clones
Sickening feeling inside my bones
Madness creeps up from behind
Sanity is drained, my state of mind

Mentally insane
Maladjusted minds
Lunacy within
Evil twisted minds

Cast my wishes from the grave
Below the Earth, my body enslaved
Cults of people down in Hell
Skulls are splitting from their spell

Forgotten souls arise at night
Rule the world with unchallenged might
The sun sets into the sea of blood
Chanting Satan as they drone

Mentally insane
Maladjusted minds
Lunacy within
Evil fucking minds
