[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

[Solo: Mike]

When you wake up in the night
And you stare into the dark
Your eyes will scream for sight
Evil left its mark
You'll be looking all above
Looking all around
But if you want to see them
You'll have to look down

Tortured by thoughts
Stricken by fear
Blasted to Hell
The end is near

As you wait upon your fate
Your throat is full of pain
And when you try to scream
You know it's all in vain
Nothing you can change
Destiny is complete
Silence seems so strange
And you start to feel the heat

Forever to burn
Infinite pain
Demons of darkness
Warriors domain

[Solo: Larry]

You think you're so secure
Protected from above
Gaze into the hell fire
I know you'll fall in love
They'll hunt you down at night
Your flesh is what they want
Your eyes will scream for sight
When evil comes to haunt

Cursed by nightmares
When you sleep
They'll cut your throat
And blood will seep

Fighting through the mist
Forever trapped in Hell
Crushed with Satan's fist
You can't escape his spell
Sanity will pass
Reality is just a word
Evil does its task
With its mighty sword

Open your eyes and die
By the hand of mass
Escape and you'll defy
My long awaited grasp

[Solos: Mike, Larry, Mike]

They want to steal your soul
Death will steal away
Your wrongs will take their toll
Below the crust you'll lay
Spell has cast no hope
Forgotten thoughts of good
Your neck awaits a rope
And things go like they should

Enslaved in forever torment
Blood drips from your eyes
There is no way to repent
From your wicked lies

Blades of steel
Cut off your head
Served as a meal
Satan is fed
Masters of evil
Blasters of Hell
No one can stop them
We're under their spell

Red eyes are glowing
With you in sight
And if you're knowing
Scream out in fright
