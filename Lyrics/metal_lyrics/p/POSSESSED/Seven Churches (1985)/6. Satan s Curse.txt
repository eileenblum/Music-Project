[Music and lyrics - MT]

Hell, evil, Satan's curse
From the sky it falls
Metal burns my fucking brain
Satan took the fall
Deceased men from hell and hatred
Pollution to mankind
Antichrist my son from hell
I will make you mine

You'll die there's no time to run from hell
You lied the witch has cast her spell
Your sins will be paid for and sacrificed
This is the price - Satan's curse

Sin, hate, eternal death
Decayed my flesh I rot
Running below Satan's home
Lord of Hell he's not
Lust for evil, son of Hell
Beneath the smoke I rise
Flames torch my body
A sinner's solar eyes

Sacrifice your soul will be doomed
Your evil friends who have deceived you
Satan's curse enters your soul
Beneath you'll burn - Satan's curse

Sky fades to black
As the heavens diminish
Evil takes over
The world is finished

[Solos: Larry, Mike, Larry, Mike]

Hell, evil, Satan's curse
From the sky it falls
Metal burns my fucking brain
Satan took the fall
Deceased men from hell and hatred
Pollution to mankind
Antichrist my son from hell
I will make you mine

You'll die there's no time to run from hell
You lied the witch has cast her spell
Your sins will be paid for and sacrificed
This is the price - Satan's curse
