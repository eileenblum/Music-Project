[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

I believe only the real
Walk through life on what I feel
Living my life from day to day
What's wrong, what's right, who's to say

I live how I want to live
I don't regret my choice
I give what I want when I want to give
And I speak my voice

Conformist pigs
Gather around
And criticize
The life I've found

Kill the pigs
Hear them squeal
They want to change
The way I feel

I cannot follow majority
It's how I'm living
Constantly

Find the power
To control
Soul on ice
Heads will roll

My belief
