[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Sail the sea
Ship of dreams
Things aren't always as they seem

Spinning thoughts
Inside my head
Thinking now of what's ahead

What is false?
And what is real?
There's no knowing how I feel

Sail the seven seas
Who will rule the world next
They will bring you to your knees

The storm is in my mind

If there is
Will I care
At my brain thoughts will tear

I want to live so fast
How long will I last
I live from day to day
I watch my brain decay

Feeling the current pull you in
Feeling you're all alone
Feel the fire burn within
Death has now begun
