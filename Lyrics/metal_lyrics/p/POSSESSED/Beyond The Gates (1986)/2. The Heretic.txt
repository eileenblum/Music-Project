[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

It is thy heritage to rule the world
Sent to defile from Belial
Revelation unorthodox
Atheistic is so mystic

Fall to the abyss of Hell
Only the weak will not rebel
The prophecies that I will tell
Will make you give your soul to sell

Tie the knots with Satan's twine
Necronomicon will be mine
To be immortal, desires of sin
You secretly hold within

Rule the world with an iron fist
Heavens above will not exist
So foolish is your exorcist
So don't deny my heretic
