[Music - LL Lyrics - JB]

Can you hear the thunder?
Can you hear the sound?
Can you hear the nightmares
That rise beneath the ground?

You can feel the sorrow
And you can feel the pain
Know there's no tomorrow
You'll never love again

The skies are filled with blood
The sun no longer rises
But no one understood

The final tribulation
The Heavens take their fall
Experience Hell's sensation
Satan standing tall

War between the powers
Fury in the skies
Heaven fights the dragon
With evil in its eyes

Tribulation
In love with Satan
Desecration
Come to Salem

Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
The power of darkness is waiting inside
As the Heavens fall down
Hell will survive
The serpent of death devours your life
