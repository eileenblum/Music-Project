[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Marching to Death's bell
Descending into Hell
Judgement Day is near
And your fate is clear

March to die, die, die, die

Take my mind and soul
Countless heads will roll
Future lies with me
Come forth, and you will see

March to die
Blackened is the sky
Is it Heaven or Hell?
Only time will tell

Pendulum will swing
Manifesting screams
Oppression will prevail
Lower the window's veil

March to die, die, die, die
