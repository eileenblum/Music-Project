[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Mutants from the battle
Survivors of the blast
Lightning fills the sky
Today will be the last

Blood stains on the earth
As the night emits its shadow
No hope of rebirth
From the final battle

No will to live, so set me free
From this pain and misery

There's no days to pass
No tomorrow here
Next breath is your last
And no time for fear

Death is in the air
And thunder in the skies
Children in despair
By his blade you die

Wear a robe of death
Stand around the fire
Steaming is your breath
Worshipping the sire

Satan's call is strong
From a world away
Tempt you with his eyes
And you will decay

No will to live, so set me free
From this pain and misery

Blood runs from my throat
Razor in my hand
Ended with a slice
All the blood is nice

Hanging by a rope
Wrapped around my neck
End my life with death
Murder on my breath

Drink the blood from my chalice
Come to Hell, and my palace
Grab your heart
It's in my hand
Take you to the evil land

Alone at night
In your grave
Coffin's door is your slave
Blackened earth is all around
Below I hear a burning sound

What could it be except for Hell?
Burning souls is what I smell

Can't suffice
So pay the price
Give your soul
Take the toll
Die

Bleed for me
Your death, so sweet
Die for me
You'll feel the heat
I am real as the earth
Can you feel Satan's birth?

In the night, the undead roam
In the day, you're dead in your home
You can live only by death
Worship Satan with the rest

Burning bodies fall from the sky
Horrid glances in their eyes
Glowing numbers on their heads
They're arrived, the living dead
