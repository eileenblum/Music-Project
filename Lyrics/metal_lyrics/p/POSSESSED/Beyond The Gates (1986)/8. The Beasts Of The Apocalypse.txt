[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Overshadowed is the earth
As the beast does spread its wings
Arrives the Dragon's birth
To rule with the seven kings
Descending from the sky
Ascending from the sea
All Holiness deprived
By the beasts of prophecy

Apostles tell visions of Hell
Dreams of pain drive them insane

Powers of the wicked one
Come forth from the nethermost Hells
Eclipsing the burning sun
Revelation tolls its bells

Heaven's rule will cease
Just as the prophets saw
Prophecies and blasphemies
Are ruled by Satan's law
Seven years, grim and dark
Man will wear the Devil's mark
Nightmares are reality
Symbolic of your destiny

Apostles tell visions of Hell
Dreams of pain drive them insane
