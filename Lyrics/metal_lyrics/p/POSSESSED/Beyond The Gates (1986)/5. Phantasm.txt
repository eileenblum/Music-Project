[Music - LL Lyrics - JB]

Welcome to your funeral
Your life has just begun
Lie in the hearse
Into the morgue
Where the dead unite as one

Into the shrine you fall
Hear the dead, they call
Angel of the damned
Walks with me, hand in hand

Fly through the night which has no end
Into the land where you're condemned
Messiah from the grave
Lead the corpse from hell
Behold the morbid saint
Come forth from whence you fell

As you walk through the valley of death
Phantasia waits for your last breath
The demons stride with the Devil's bride
Rest in peace

Phantom, spread your wings
As the black coven sings
Eyes which mesmerize
From the crypts they rise
