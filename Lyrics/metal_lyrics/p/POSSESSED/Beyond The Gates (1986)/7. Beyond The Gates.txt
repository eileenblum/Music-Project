[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

I bow to the altar
For I bow to my faith
Guide me to my destiny
With everlasting grace

Unholy are my thoughts
In you I must confide
I prowl among the nights
With Satan at my side

Bow to the altar
The pagan one
Pray for the birth
Of Belial's son

Beyond the gates

Lucifer, hear me
I pray to the altar
I hear the sounds of insanity
Master, I drink the unholy water
Save me the torment that beckons for me

Walk through illusions of terror to come
And I could tell you of things I have done
I saw the gates
The future I've grasped
I've been beyond Gates of the past

Unearth the graves of all mankind
Beyond dead and buried
Enter the shrine
Condemned to the torture
The horror and pain
Enslaved by your sins
Brought under death's reign

Lucifer, see me
I live for the night
Stalking and prowling in the moonlight
I crave the unholy temple below
Spreading the tales of death that I know
