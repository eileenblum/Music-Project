They broke our backs against the pavement
They ground our teeth down to the bone
The hung us high and bled us dry
Left to die here, defenseless and alone

In the dark
Like a forest fire waiting for a hint of spark
Take up your arms, sharpen your knives
They gave their very last chance when they gave our lives away

Words betray us in the native tongues we speak
When power corrupts the strong, false hope contends all weak
Break the confines, brace us for the flood
Raining from the heavens with the force of seven gods on us all

(We were all fixated on ego)

All our lives, just a drop in the ocean
One more nail in the coffin, straight into the dirt
Born to die, it's the final debt that we pay
The stain on your hands that can't be washed away

(Can't be washed away)

A permanent solution, a moral absolution
The guilty many, the new disorder
The bloody hand leads the lamb to the slaughter

I heard them laugh as their eyes rolled back
Raising a glass as their hearts turned black

Tyrant, how can you stand by their graves?
Not all can be saved

A wasted chance to set things straight
A change of heart that came too late
Out of sight and out of mind
We are the ones you left behind

Can you hear the sound?
(A wasted chance to set things straight)
Piercing the silence ringing out
(A change of heart that came too late)

As we feed the ground
(Out of sight and out of mind)
We are the ones you left behind

All our lives, just a drop in the ocean
One more nail in the coffin, straight into the dirt
Born to die, it's the final debt that we pay
The stain on your hands that can't be washed away

We are the ones you left behind
We are the ones you left behind
