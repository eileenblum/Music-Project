Look at yourself
Narrow of mind, shallow of breath
So far removed from the plight
So far removed from the death of your kin, downtrodden and ill

Oh so high as you stood, how heavy you fell
As so many will fall for the bait
Compassion too little, too late
For some small peace of mind

How can you walk on the bones of your brothers' broken homes
Knowing how karma's cold hand grips at your throat?

I've been trapped beneath the soil and the dirt
Do I close my eyes, do I close my eyes?
Lying still beneath the burden and the hurt
Am I dead inside, did I make it right?

Left in the dark, in blackest oblivion
Only forced me to learn that light comes from within
And only fades where fear prevails

Where is your heart? (Where is your heart?)
Does it grow weaker each time you think
Of those you scorned from afar? (From afar)
Their voices rise from the wreck to call you by name
The blood that tarnished the brush will mark us the same

What have we done?
What have we done?

Can you fight this, can you fight this alone and abandoned?
Look where we've landed and know
This must all have a consequence
Nothing, nothing will make sense again

You'll never rest peacefully
You'll never rest peacefully
You'll never rest peacefully

You cowards, you cowards, you left them for dead
Left them out in the cold, they said
You liars, back-stabbers, sold out your own kind
I can't turn a blind eye, can't rewind
