Where do we go now?

I'm still trying to find the words
A quarter lifetime on
As if a pen and paper could restore
The greatest loss I've known

Every outline of you lingers in the door
Every cigarette, a silhouette in ash drawn upon the floor
Remember how they told me, "You're too young to understand
You will shift just like the weather as you grow into a man"

This I know

My life has flashed before my eyes
And the days all seemed to pass me by
All the pain I earned and the love I lost
Was the only truth, this all will someday soon return to dust

Return to dust

And if we all go to hell, I'll find some peace where I dwell
I never thought there was more to this than met the eye
When I have no more to give, surrender my right to live
We're only killing time 'til time kills us and we

Decay together
We're not built to live forever

Content to shed my blissful ignorance
No fire, no light, an insignificant mistake

And if we all go to hell, I'll find some peace where I dwell
I never thought there was more to this than met the eye
When I have no more to give, surrender my right to live
We're only killing time 'til time kills us

My life has flashed before my eyes
And the days all seemed to pass me by
All the pain I earned and the love I lost
Was the only truth, this all will someday soon return to dust
