I know I said I'm not worth saving
I know you tried before
I always knew you grew to hate
The parts of me I hated more

Just put me up, stick me back together
Rearrange the pieces, build me up to tear me down

(You look at me like a stranger)
You look at me like a stranger
You look at me like a long lost son

Oh dearest mother, you gave me my name
I asked for nothing, you asked for me to change
With imperfection, we're already stained
And when it's all over, we'll never be the same

I feel their hands around my neck
Contorting, moulding all the thoughts in my head
I'm not a man you can mend
But rest assured, you'll see me break before I bend

What does it matter in the end?
Build me up to tear me down

You look at me like a stranger
I'm only trying to be someone

Oh Holy Father, I'm calling Your name
I don't deserve this, You don't deserve me to change
This self-indulgence, this sick, selfish game
Serves a constant reminder; we'll never be the same

Oh fallen brother, you swore that you'd stay
I guess it's over, I guess that's the price we pay
And in the darkness, I still hear you say
"If we ever survive this, we'll never be the same"

We'll never be the same
