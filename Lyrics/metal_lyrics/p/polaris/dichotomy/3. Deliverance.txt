Stay safe in your skin.
You canât ignore the itch that creeps in.
Stick to your senses.

This flesh, a rusted cage, now tear it off.
Shed this withered shell like the snake that youâve become.
Your mouth holds a devilâs tongue
that whispers liquid lies to thirsty ears
who drink your poison words.
Youâve always reaped but never sown a single seed:
Youâll never fucking grow.
You will never fucking grow at all.
You will never fucking grow.

Now I know this time,
your colours will fade to black and white.
Itâll take some time for every trace to fade.

Iâll web my way inside your mind,
Iâll creep around cocooning myself deep into your thoughts.
In every vision I will be lurking in the background.
Every memory will be laced and tainted.

If you were bound to me,
youâd be my misery, but Iâd be your end.

This time your colours will fade to black and white.
Itâll take some time for every trace to fade.

Now I know this time,
your colours will fade to black and white.
Itâll take some time for every trace to fade.
These eyes have seen so much pain â how could you be so blind?
Itâll take some time for every trace to fade.

If you were bound to me,
youâd be my misery, but Iâd be your end.
