The past has proven, through days gone by,
those fed by cruel hands
seem to sharpen their teeth for the bite,
while below the skin lies potential
to choose a greater path.

Realise your actions hold consequence,
and for each misguided step you take,
someone must bear the weight.

Compromise is never something Iâd take lightly.
Cauterise the wounds and let the scars speak for themselves.

Burgeoning, Iâve come to terms with an imperfect past,
knowing when our lives diverged my friend,
you chose the wrong path.

Carve these words into stone:
I have waited patiently for this time.
I will leave behind a legacy.
The weak willed will rupture and break.

Compromise is never something Iâd take lightly.
Cauterise the wounds and let the scars speak for themselves.

I will be the change that is needed.
I will be the foundation stone.
