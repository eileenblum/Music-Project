This narrative begins at a point in time
in this unfamiliar reality, where you have been defined
not as you were, but as what youâve become:
a brother to all, but a son to no one.

I was once not unlike you.
Benign and beaten down,
I scoured the corners of the earth
in search of a better way.
I ploughed the furthest depths, myriad leagues below,
and where you found that sinking feeling,
thatâs where I found myself.

I told myself that there was nothing there for me,
ensnared within a vacancy that only I could see.
Each step I ever took was a vow
never to return to that place I left,
in search of what I always lacked:
My security.

I know this desperation breeds acceptance of any alternative,
so I made a promise to myself that I wonât break.

Meet me at the turning point,
Iâll be waiting there for you my friend.

Give me strength.
Give me a new mentality.
Give me hope.

Meet me at the turning point,
Iâll be waiting there.

Give me strength.
Give me a new mentality.
And give me hope.
