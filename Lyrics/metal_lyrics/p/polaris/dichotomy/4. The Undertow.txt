No words that spill from your mouth
could overcome the ringing in my ears.
The blood is pounding in my temples
and it deafens me, engulfs my thoughts.

After waiting and wishing for so many years,
I have turned back the clocks,
trying to fill the hole that was left.
But an empty heart could never fill one so pure.

This was never my intention: a future not of my invention.
This was never my intention: I feel it coming to a close.

And now Iâve seen the end of all Iâve known.
My chest is sinking like a stone.
Iâll wait for the numbness to set in,
and hope Iâll never feel again.

Itâs getting harder to face the truth,
but my frustration is fruitless.
I canât decide for you. I canât decipher you.

And as Iâm getting older, Iâm starting to believe
that there is nothing on this earth that measures up to what you need.
When every future is a tempest in an unrelenting sea,
and every consolation seems so hollow, it all seems so false to me.

As the years keep slipping by,
the voices racing through my head will always keep me up at night.
From the ashes with these broken hands, I will rebuild my life.
This time I wonât look back.
My heart was always in the right place.

And now Iâve seen the end of all Iâve known.
My chest is sinking like a stone.
Iâll wait for the numbness to set in,
and hope Iâll never feel.

Again I find myself alone, and I just sink like a stone.
