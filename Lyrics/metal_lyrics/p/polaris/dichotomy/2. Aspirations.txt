Iâve spent my life chasing ambitions
that were just beyond my reach,
just to feel so disenchanted as potential fell to waste.
But still I tremble at the thought of my unaccomplished aims,
knowing all my best laid plans
might leave me reeling and empty handed.

Vicious circles are a false sense of progression.
Every wrong turn one step further from my goal,
furthering the distance in my mind.

The path less travelled is one Iâve feared to walk,
but hesitation is a dead end road.

It seems Iâve always run away.
Turned my back on uncertainty
(Never dared to face my own worst fears).
A life spent being led astray will never amount to anything,
until my reflection shows me
that the hands that held me back are none but my own.

My heart will never be another unrequited dream.
Iâll travel the earth and seas to find a heart that beats for me.

And though the winds will change, Iâll find new strength to fill my sails,
each growing breath one final push to carry me home.

Searching for so long just to find
what was right in front of me all this time.
It takes so much just to open up your eyes.
And when you feel like you're alone,
look for strength to find your way back home and carry on.

Nothing comes of apathy.
