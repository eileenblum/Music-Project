Keep walking forward, step in line,
Dead inside and anesthetised to thought and pain.

We're always watching our footing,
Treading all so carefully,
When conscience is all we can depend on;
Separating men from machines in a manufactured world,
Where we've all grown numb
To self-assessment,
And self-control,
Yet still so quick to judge one another.

Crawling back to a finish line
With no reward for our constant strive,
We know nothing of sacrifice,
No sense of consequence pervades our minds.
We've walked this path for far too long.

And every day,
Every day I feel it slip further away,
The minutes tick by, and turn to years.
And in the morning I'll awake
Believing nothing new has changed,
Except my outlook has turned inside.

And now I've seen the fading lights
Grow cold and turn to night.
The only warning sign
To cut these worldly ties

We'll align ourselves with the stars,
And tell the world we know who we are,
Based on reflections in deception's mirror.
Anesthetised to thought and pain,
We take what we're given,
With no second guess,
And walk away all the same.

We owe no allegiance
Give rise to your own independence;
The dawn of a new era,
Where lives are valued and not regarded
As commodities for the worst of men.
Take my hand.
It's no utopian promised land.
This will take everything.

Seeking light of our own.
Breathe in life, breathe in hope.
We've walked this path for far too long.
