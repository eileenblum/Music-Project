I came into this world an unmarked page, 
But I've stained the paper with lines that I cannot erase 
Discarded my identity, 
A fragment of what I used to be 

An iron mind in paper walls 
Is not a stable foundation in this ongoing storm, 
And now these hands of stone have eroded, collapsed again 

I see a stranger's face staring in the mirror, 
Who I was, was somewhere lost along the way 
Caught in an empty space, I never thought I'd be here, 
Each day I feel it take a part of me 

No retribution. No compromise. 
Selfishly self-immolating inside 
Burn, burn me alive. I've seen the other side 
Burn me, set me alight 

I see a stranger's face staring in the mirror, 
Who I was, was somewhere lost along the way 
Caught in an empty space, I never thought I'd be here, 
Each day I feel it take a part of me 

I can't deny this feeling, I can't ignore the pain 
Of knowing I am human, and we all feel the fucking same 
We're all born to feel this way 

And so I ask myself, 
Is the measure of a man, his character, his worth, 
Contained by what his heart holds or contained within his works? 
My motivations have never strayed, 
But somewhere I think they were buried along the way 

I see a stranger's face staring in the mirror, 
Who I was, was somewhere lost along the way 
Caught in an empty space, I never thought I'd be here, 
Each day I feel it take a part of me 

I've seen the other side
