[feat. Marcus Bridge]I've learned a lot about repentance, a lot about my shame 
I felt the dark inside me long before it called my name 
I thought my spine was stronger, 'til my bones began to break, 
from all the weight of never-ending 
Hate. Hate what I've done, 
When the floodgates are open, and the damage is done 
Hate what I've become 
The fight forgotten hasn't always been won 

I feel the pressure closing in, 
it weighs on my mind 'til I start to cave in 
Regret is calling out to me, and I'm tired of answering 

So sick of searching for a sense of relief 
So sick of seeing my conscience as the enemy 
So cut me off before it's too late to see 
I'll weigh you down 'til you're sinking with me 

Forgiveness never seemed so far 
Pick at the scabs enough, soon they turn to scars 
I was young and idealistic, that was stripped away by time, 
And in the end all that was left was 
Hate. Hate what I've done 
When the floodgates are open, and the damage is done 
The clocks won't stop, the race is already run 

I feel the pressure closing in, 
it weighs on my mind til I start to cave in 
Regret is calling out to me, and I'm tired of answering 

In a crooked spiral 
In a spin that never comes to rest 
We turn again, we turn again 

In a flame of repentance 
We wash away the pain and the regret 
We burn again, we burn again 

In a crooked spiral 
In a spin that never comes to rest 
We turn again, we turn again 

In a flame of repentance 
In a permanent purgatory 
We burn again, we burn again 

So sick of searching for a sense of relief 
So sick of seeing my conscience as the enemy 
So cut me off before it's too late to see 
I'll weigh you down til you're sinking with me
