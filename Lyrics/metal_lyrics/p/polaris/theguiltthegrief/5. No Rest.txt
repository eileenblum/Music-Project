We fell together, and then we fell apart 
So absent minded I was blinded from the start 
Excuses hollow, absent and alone 
Trying to find a place for me to lay my head and home 

I needed some time to take time for myself 
I needed a moment to breathe 
I needed some silence to placate the violence growing inside of me 

So scatter my ashes, and throw me to the wind 
There's no rest for the wicked, and god, how I've sinned 

So unaware, so disconnected 
So absent minded I was blinded by the choice 
But everything I have could be taken away, 
Without a moment to spare 
With nothing ventured, there's nothing gained, 
But you have to believe I still cared 

Give me some time to take time for myself 
Give me a moment of sleep 
Give me some quiet to break up the riot growing inside of me 

So scatter my ashes, and throw me to the wind 
There's no rest for the wicked, and god, how I've sinned 
But I tried and I tried, I just wanted to be 
A better man for the rest of my days 
I know that the world is bigger than you and me 
Cut me open and see how I bleed 

So scatter my ashes, and throw me to the wind 
There's no rest for the wicked, and god, how I've sinned 
But I tried and I tried, I just wanted to be 
A better man for the rest of my days 
I know that the world is bigger than you and me
