Hold your tongue and close your eyes, 
There's nothing here to see but sacrifice 
Swallow the pill to ease your mind 
Just bloodsuckers with an axe to grind 

But we won't be silenced, when there is so much at stake 
You've lost all trace of humanity 
You're all condoning the violence, closed mouths speak in volumes the same 
You've lost all trace of humility 
I've said it before, I'll say it again, it's got to end 

These walls they fucking talk to me, the bars they scream a prayer 
How can you even sleep at night, how can you say you care? 

Separation, you've cut the conversation, 
But it whispers on the wind 
Can't deny it, there's so much said in silence 
Complicit and contained, you've lost your way 

You stitched the lips of an honest man, 
With no attempt to understand 
You're not so different 

When we can't trust our protectors, 
These hypocrites and social hypochondriacs, 
Who will guide us home? 

Now the poison's in the water 
The serum's in the very air we breathe 

Can you feel it in the air? Can you taste it on the wind? 
The war you think you're fighting is still yet to begin 
But if you looked into their eyes, then maybe you would see 
The dis-illusion of a land of prosperity 
You stitched the lips of an honest man
