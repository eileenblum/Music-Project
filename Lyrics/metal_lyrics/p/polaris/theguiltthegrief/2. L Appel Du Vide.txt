I was a king cast down, no throne nor crown 
No claim to my name or my past 
A sense of self-worth so immeasurably small, 
In a universe stretching so vast, and so airless 

Day by day my life force continued to fade 
Pull me from this atrophy, restore the life blood back into my veins 

Strength comes from admitting weaknesses inside us, 
Staring our fears in the eye 

I'd give anything 
To be the one who kept composure, 
To start over 

And I want you to know there won't always be an answer 
There won't always be a perfect ending 
Is it all too late? Are we too far gone to save? 
Never thought we'd walk so willing to an early grave 

Haven't we suffered enough? 
Haven't we shouldered the world? 
The world that beat us down 

I'd give anything 
To be the one who kept composure, 
To start over 

I'm a truth unspoken 
I'm a life untold 
I'm a mind unbroken 
Til my blood runs cold
