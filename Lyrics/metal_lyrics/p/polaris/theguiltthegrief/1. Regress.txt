We are the gears in this churning machine, 
The burning steam from the crack in the surface 
We are your soul's insomnia, the restless heart of indignation, 
Forever awake 

You're all insane, staring at inevitable change 
The selfish few who will stand in the way 
But with each orbit you beg the world to turn at your will, 
To rotate in reverse 

You're not a hero if you're trapped behind a mask 
Can't hear them screaming when your head is in the sand 

We're hopeless, we're helpless, we'll wait here for a sign 
Or stare into the sun until we're blind, and out of time 

You left each other to drown in a sea of ill concern, 
In search of a thorned crown you were never meant to earn 

You'd set the world ablaze to warm your hands on the flames 
How did we let it come to this? We're all to blame 

This isn't progress 
This. Is. Not. This isn't progress 
Misled and sick in the head, playing the victim again 

You're not a hero if you're trapped behind a mask 
Can't hear them screaming when your head is in the sand 
What will it take to make you see? 

We're hopeless, we're helpless, we'll wait here for a sign 
Or stare into the sun until we're blind, and out of time 
We are the gears in this churning machine, 
The burning steam from the crack in the surface 
We are your soul's insomnia, the restless heart of indignation.
