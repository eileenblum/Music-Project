when asking god for an answer
you're wasting your time
be prepared to wait
I can't hear anything at all
an as the silence resounds
don't feel let down
don't blame yourself
you're wasting your time

I like to see 
fire-fighters fail
it's nice to see
how they fall in the fire
horoscopes and weather forecasts
suggest upset stomach
your hands stink of coins

it may be time
to dip our toes into the thames
looking over both shoulders
as liquid enters the lungs
the strength of this reflex
is greater in cold water
and with any luck
it will pull us under
a heaving heart
an empty spit bucket

liars will prevail
hands drift towards the mortar
don't die, please don't die
on an empty stomach
with heavy lungs
taking in salt water
drain the river's mouth
drain the river's mouth
we are all in need
when you can't control your hands
a heaving heart
wet shoes, sealed eyes, and the stars
a final glance confirms
that everything is meaningless

goobye to all friends
and past loves
this is the parting note
so save your thoughts
a heaving heart as liquid enters the lungs
and with any luck
it will pull us under
such a waste
such a fucking waste

drain the river's mouth
gulping, necking, fisting petrol
we're pleased to report
blood turns to wine

sharp neon lights catch us
writing brithday card to the dead
