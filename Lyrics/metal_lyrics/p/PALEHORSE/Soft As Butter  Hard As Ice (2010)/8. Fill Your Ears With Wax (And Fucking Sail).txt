we've tried to sleep at night if only for a handful of hours
but I keep getting the unavoidable feeling
the really crippling impression
that the worst thing in the world is about to happen

like a cascade of broken wills
or broken eyelids, or something else altogether
so I'm hoping these nauseating moments
will find kindness enough to give way

this isn't elegant, but we thought we might be able to avoid
letting every day seem precisely like the last
ashamed and terrified and eyes twitching
and your boss will notice this in the morning

on the edge of the mattress
with a foot on the floor for balance
a burning cigarette in the ashtray
and paracetamol, just in case

so you'll remember I raised the bed at an angle
with a variety of worthless books under both corners
only in vain hope
it might settle your stomach

the sound of a word
echoed shortly by the next
but now, and quite suddenly, the real terror
the misery of complete fucking silence

I can imagine there might be many ways, not just this one,
to become hardened and more absolute
and a constant and unmixed
sense of loss will usually keep it that way

placing one foot in the soil
and simply praying the other follows
everything should be thrown away instantly
without a thought or second glance

you weep tears in rows
that are roads to the rope you'll weave
and when you dance your final jig
I'll cheer with the crowd

you lie in ways that are worn
with overuse
and when you finally drown
I'll drink with the boys

you gather branch after branch
and lay them against your knees
when you burn
I'll fan the flames to warm myself

I've had my crew
lash me to the mast
and when you sing your next song
it'll be your last

the sound of a word
echoed shortly by the next
the misery of complete fucking silence

rain, and tears and bleating
and we're still yawning
as good as dead

there's a digging beneath the gums
and you have to fucking pay for it

the last time we tried to bleed parts of the body
for the sake of salvage
many people kissed
many flowers of all sorts

and dipped their heads
over mounds of earth
of earth

an ideal action would be to cut off all the limbs
at source, and set them to sea
another option is to write a pointless and forlorn
love letter to your scandalous wife on shore

you should know by now
that all hope is lost in the belly of a whale
you should know by now
nobody's coming home
