leave your sex toys on the floor
leave your cheque book at the door
not enough...
whiskey

leave your face-print on the wall
leave your knickers
I like fucking
and getting drunk

not another wedding
funeral or baptism
or dinner parties with your parents
please
rest on my chest
please
will you hold my hand
please
fuck your friends
please
write you name in ink and blood
and fucking leave

leave your sex toys on the floor
leave your cheque book at the door
I like fucking
and getting drunk
I like getting...
fucking drunk

it's my fault
it's my fault
it's your fault
it's your fault
it's my fault
it's my fault
hold my hand
kiss my eyelids
leave your mark
on the carpet
