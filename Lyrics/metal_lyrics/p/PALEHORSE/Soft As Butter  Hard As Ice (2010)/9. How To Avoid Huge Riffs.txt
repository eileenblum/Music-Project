"can we turn the music off please
exactly. fine. no, no it's fine, actually I don't
undress yourself, quickly
you're beautiful, it's okay"
such innocence
upper lip white
and bottom lip blue
such fragrant incense

lost in lust's perfume
a slender wrist
a withered frame
wrapped in tarpaulin
blemished skin

"I don't know, whiskey, wine
literally whatever you've got
I don't hate you
I just said I didn't
I just said I didn't, right now"
sun-blemished, white-washed
ghost-like

you're beautiful
"this is impossible"
your portrait stillness
"it's borderline fucking pointless"
so elegant
like a lotus flower hand-carved in ice
as inviting as christmas lights

like a fallen deity
draped in chinese jade
so ornate

let me miscarry for you
I'm in need of the protein
an exceeded dose
a struggled breath
a flatline
such a tragic coda

the church bell tolls
and the church bell chimes
for the last time
like singing the blues for the last time

the cry of the choir
ascends like a sex crime
your back is an open canvas
your legs are like bear-traps
murderous and unforgettable
faultless and listless

I should have heaved
the barbed stems from my throat
the guilt of the world
upon which we can hang ourselves
the collapse
fashion a smile through the white noise

and I can't take this anymore

the first was a suicide note
the second a proposition of marriage
the third was a suicide note

an aching head
an unspoilt bed

like a flower
hand-carved in ice
and about as inviting as christmas lights

can we turn the music off please
it's not consistent with the ambience

your hair, teeth, skin, eyes

another murder
with hands like these

can we turn the music off please
it's not consistent with the ambience
