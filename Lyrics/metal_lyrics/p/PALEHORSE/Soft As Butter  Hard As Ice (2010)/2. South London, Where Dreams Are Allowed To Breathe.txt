I want to bleed from my nose
I want tears to fall from my eyes
I want spit to drip down my chin
I was fast asleep until my eyes opened
I used to breathe deep but recently it's mostly grasping for air
I used to love with ease, but that's near enough broken

I hate myself
I want blood to run straight from my nose
and I want the bile to flow from my mouth
I want it from my mouth

I want skin to fall from my flesh
I want bones to snap at the joint
I want lungs to give up
I want guts pulled from my fucking throat
I want blood to bleed from my nose
I want bones to snap at the joint

skin falls from the flesh
bones snap at the fucking joint

goodbye to all my friends
go make your beds
pride has turned on itself
so go catch your fucking death
farewell to my friends
carve your blackened caskets

it's your family, it's your life
the tears have opened my eyes

death has opened my heart and eyes
to the worthless children, who fill their time
thinking there is a purpose
I want blood to bleed from my nose
until the passengers complain
