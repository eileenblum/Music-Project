the first time an adult hit you
or the final time a love one kissed you

the scandal of being alive
lighting fire after fire
as our heroes meet their maker
and we're busy wasting our time
playing in bands that don't amount to anything
and having the nerve to be proud of it
still, alcohol should solve some of the problems
or at least help to forget them
we were supposed to have kids by now
friends who loved gardening
and an understanding wife
I thought we were meant to grow up and settle down

we are flesh
we are dead
we are unborn architects
we are flesh
we are dead

hey, hey lower your heads

these are dead or failing limbs
we are barstool alchemists

dead man, lower your heads
broken bones make for better health

there's no cause to think
that anything will ever change

dead man, no more rest
leave the dying to the living

you have said
you will say
you will say
you have said
what, what will become of us now?
hey, are these the last words we'll say?

stop cleaning the word-worned furniture and the resultant ephemera
I have come to brink of utter ruin in the midst of the entire assembly
like another bad day
and on and on and on
like another bad day
and on and on and on
like another bad day
it carries on and on and on
like another bad day
and it's on and on and on
like another bad dream
it goes on and on and on
like another bad day
and on and on and on
like another bad day
it carries on and on and on

there's not, there's not an emotion
just breathe, don't forget to breathe
