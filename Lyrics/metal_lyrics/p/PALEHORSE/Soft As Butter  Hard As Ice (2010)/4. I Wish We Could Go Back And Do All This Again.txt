no plans for today
except cabin fever and anxiety attacks

if you feel like walking
until you no longer know where you are

nil by mouth for days
drinking the noyac in fucking tears

one of the first signs
of the beginning of understanding is the wish to die
the wish to die

I want to be left alone
but please stay with me
I need some time by myself
don't go just yet
I'll be gone for a few months
I'll be fine I promise
I'd like to be left alone now
but can you stay with me for a while

forget your gods, friends, life, death
it's a false dawn, it's a lost cause
eyes, teeth, tongue, lips
dry-wrenched, vomit

forget your gods
forget your friends
forget your life
forget death
