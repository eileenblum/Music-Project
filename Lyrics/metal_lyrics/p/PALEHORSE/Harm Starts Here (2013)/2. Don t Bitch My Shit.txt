Andy, I know your mates
Andy, I've read your books
Andy, I know your mates
Andy, I know their games

They are good mountain dogs
Search and rescue
Special ops

Leave

The Pakistan army are better than Chris
They know the bandits
You cannot expect beings
Even with zero intelligence
To deal with discrepit things like you

God almighty Andy
The U.S.A.F dumps on everyone
Especially kids

Don't you care, Andy?
Don't you care about the kids, Andy?

Can't you go to D.C.?
And dump D.C. for good?

Roger that, over and out

Commander shit squad
