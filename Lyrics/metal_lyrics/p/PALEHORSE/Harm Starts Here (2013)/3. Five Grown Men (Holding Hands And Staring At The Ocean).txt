Light shines through
Holes from the staples
The slits in your hips
Drool and albumen

Holiday Inn
Wedding reception
I have never
Felt so cold

Red brick powder
Torn nylons
Eucalyptus leaves
Rattling like bones

We were cutting nails
We were cutting nails and you're cutting our thoat
The trials of a wife
The trials of a wife at the edge of the woods

In a 12 x 12
Yourself to blame
All bets are off
Your dear dog is dead

It's about time
Mountains folded
Across and beneath
Your beaten brow

I'm drowning here
And you're describing the water

There is no humour in heaven

We've all lost!
Holy Christ!
What a thought!

There is no crumb of comfort
And as a youth I used to weep in butcher's shops

With limp arms and verdigris
Sallow cheek absurdity

Fuck this open wound
Spattering on your chest

So, did you think it right
To heave open God's eyes?

They are blind!

Our hung clothes are a dead version of us
And our hung clothes, they are a dead version of us
Aversion of us
Our hung clothes are a dead version of us

Let's fall down the stairs together

Broken nails and bloodshot eyes

So he's glued to the bed, immovable eyes
Gripping the hand, dependable wife
He said: "I'm not afraid of death my darling,
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid I'm terrified of life"

A stampede of bad will
Broken nails and bloodshot eyes

"I'm not afraid of death my darling,
I'm terrified - I'm terrified of life"

Sunscreen and alabaster
Cattle skulls and cheap cigars
Let's fall down the stairs together
Glued to the bed, immovable eyes
Gripping the hand, dependable wife
He said: "I'm not afraid of death my darling, my dearest.
My darling I'm terrified. I'm terrified of life"

"Brave tales have I. They're brave tales of life"
Glued to the bed, immovable eyes
Gripping the hand, dependable wife

I've said our hung clothes
Are a dead version of us

He's glued to the bed
Immovable eyes
Gripping the hand, dependable wife
"I'm terrified. I'm terrified of life"
