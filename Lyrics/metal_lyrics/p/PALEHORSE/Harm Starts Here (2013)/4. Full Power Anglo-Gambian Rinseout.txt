I don't see so pretty
Twilit, fat and dripping
You don't seem so pretty
Varicose and veins rippling

I don't see so pretty
Red curtains swishing
You seem much less pretty
With these strange growths listering

(In the dark, dark city)

I don't see so pretty
You're fading, oh fickle pale mistress
Your body, a dreaming dense city
I don't like to share your streets
Speckled, spattered, seeping
How to erase these streaks

(I'll just carry on with headphones on)

Where are your friends?
They are losing weight
An old man once said
To see out the night
Keep your head to the door

I'm so upset about everything
But no amount of whimpering
Is going to change that
We'll salivate blind

Be home soon with a twist in the mouth smiling
Be home soon with a twist in the mouth crying
