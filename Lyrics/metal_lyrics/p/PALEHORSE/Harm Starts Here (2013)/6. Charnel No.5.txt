Across the crowded room
I can't but catch your perfume
You are like an empty room
Like it's only me and you

Who is fooling who?
Are you a flesh eater in bloom?
Is it the dead cert of the tomb?
Or your body's inexorable ruin?

Like a beacon in the gloom
Like a siren's crooked tune
It's as if the sun and moon
Grind and gravitate around you

I think you can guess
What happened next
