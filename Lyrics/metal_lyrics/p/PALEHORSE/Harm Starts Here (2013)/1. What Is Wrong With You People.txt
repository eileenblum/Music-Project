This process reeks of shit
This handshake smells of vomit
This kiss burns the lips
I love you all, and I'm ashamed of it

What's the point if no-one's watching
Now sweating and hateful and frightful and hopeful
I'm riding the train and thinking about death - it's fairly pathetic
I'm embarrassed about it, but I'll get there with or without your help

Brave horizons? What horizons?
Why do you still keep your hands in the air?

I would love to tell you everything
I would tell you everything
If it wasn't the same old fucking story
I'm sorry

Our hands are clean
Perhaps not mine
A tomb to share
And don't claw out

What the fuck did we do to deserve this?
This isn't a gift, it's a burden
This isn't for friends, it's for hermits
This isn't the end it's our birthday

What the fuck did we do to deserve this?
This isn't a joy, it's a fucking car crash
It's painful enough without the tinnitus
This isn't the end, this isn't the end

I'm ashamed of it
This isn't the end
