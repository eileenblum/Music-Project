snubbed at birth, removal of air
no more gastric juices for baby to shave
denied the comfort of oxygen
body parts swirl in lieu of disengagement
do your best to ignore life
there's five seconds left till never
hanged by angel's hair you severed
you cannot conceive of forever
you will be built up to never know
stab your whole family tree
and pretend that you're not here
cancel subscription to full head of steam
hope asks permission to smoke in the canteen
piles of magazines hide the view of excrement
but is the dwarf in your shoebox really that content?
