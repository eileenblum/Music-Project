pan koÃ²ikov is a carpenter. he works alone.every day he looks out at the summer skythrough the grimy bars of his small window.but he is happy. forty years of toil and strifeare finally paying off. word is getting aroundthe small town, and he's getting more work.everyday at noon he goes to buy bread fromthe baker down the road. on the way he passesa little girl begging in the street, dirt on herclothes and her hands. her name is anna andeveryone in town knows her. he sparedher hardly a second glance. despite her pleasfor food - everyday is the same. one day pan koÃ²ikov is very happy. he isgetting more and more work and decides tobuy two loaves instead of the usual one. as hepasses anna, he relents, and for the first time,gives her a loaf of bread. the next day, annais back at her station. she is convinced thatthat was the extent of her luck. but pankoÃ²ikov beckons her over to his workshop;he sends her to buy the bread, promising hera fresh loaf. the next day, expectant, annaneeds no beckoning. she runs to buy thebread and is happy. this continues everyday until the skygradually turns grey and the winds startto pick up....the old man looks out ofhis door. anna is waiting for him as pernormal. he slowly steps out and looksdown at her. "sorry", he says. "there isno bread today. for you, or for me. peoplewill not buy my tables in winter." sheturns, and walks away, and sits back downin her old position on the street once more....
