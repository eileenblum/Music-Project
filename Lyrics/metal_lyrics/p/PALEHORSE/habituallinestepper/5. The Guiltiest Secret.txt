storm a storm stormbringer rise fury wings rain-maker bring it do it now all life is just a slowed down heart attack so
don't look around just feel down just wash it all away to your favorite place: the drain all life is just a slowed down cardiac arrest and the guiltiest secret I know is you want it, so so bad heart beating, breaking passing fad maenads deep in drink bad luck you
headless, poet, lyrist, orpheus give in give up soiling the hebrus driftwood on the shores of lesbos where at least they'll bury your skull face-down knee-deep subsumed in bitumen darkening, forming, contraction cracks we'll drape the insides and entrails like so many
ornaments across the naked picture rail and we will always remember how to stave off sleep with arguments, tears and drink stained-glass cabinets useless artefacts your mouth loves you sweating, bleeding clean, eyes ahead I left two notes for you in south-west London
thank god you won't find them two deeply selfish documents these arms are anvils these shoulders will soon give way toothless, the jaw drops bleeding clean, eyes ahead this will be my last drink I promise you, I promise me blankly scanning the walls the stench, the
weight of these artefacts these fucking dreams are over-run with images and thoughts of death this is the god-awful truth and, I promise you, this is not a cry for help this is the ugly reality this is not a lie
