another fucking nightmare of bashing heads together oh dear, I'm such a fucking nightmare melting heads together you thought that you had the answer but you didn't even fucking try you thought you could
get away with murder but you didn't even fucking try thought you had the answer but you didn't try not now liar lies fucking her you lied to fuck her liar "nigger please on your knees you heard the command do as you're told" the genealogy of your whole scene are you so
fucking comfortable that you've got a flag for your sexuality are you so fucking comfortable that you can trace your root back to zero no and dominate against everyone and this might be your final try for you to make that leap I'd love you or your breath you're right we
all deserve to die and now you are perfect and now you make your shape a halo of blades of grass and strands of hair and then the arms descend to a place like Christ from nowhere I can hear the grinding of my teeth blood-loss and anvils to have nothing in common with
yourself and to stand very quietly in a corner content that you might breathe let's take a final dip in bottles and silt how to vomit over daddy's death kitchen cloth, break and vowels quit fucking up you've got the keys still your shaking hands you're at the door please
father one request as your parting shot close the door
