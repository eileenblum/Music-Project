Are we just some kind of puppets on a string
Enslaved to be tools of presidents and kings
Players in a show that runs almost for free
Only to the costs of those whose straings are weak

It's a tragedy (tragedy) - neglet the domination
Like a parody (parody) - a fiendfish agitation

The people of the world - on a collision course
Dictators and religions - the population as their toys
Racial hate unfurled - it's a collision course
Humanity collides - it's a collision course

Stop - breaking the rules of nature
Blind - can't you see the danger
Mute - standing there in silence
Screaming echoes of hate and violence

(A puppet you no longer shall be - set yourself free)

The troops are sent out - for a fast kill
Are we directed without an owl will
Do we have to obey - in order to survive
Do we have to march on to sacrifice life

A possibility (it would be) - to neglet the domination
Play a parody (parody) - war assassination

The people of the world - on a collision course
Dictators and religions - the population as their toys
Nations of the earth - it's a collision course
Humanity collides - it's a collision course
