Attracting looks of hatred - hate is in their souls
Past and future fight without control
Do you feel their anger? - what have they been told?
The books of history have to be closed

Falling...beneath the shadows of the past
Strawling...to leave the past behind

You are just a victim of our memory
Forget the past and just be free

Falling...the blood in your veins seems to burn
Burning...burning up inside

Deep in there down in your heart
Down in your soul there's something cold
And you feel the misery
And you hear them pray

Overshadowed...history terrifying me
Overshadowed...must we feel this pain
Of the shadows in our soul

(You're) falling...inner feelings so absurd
Turning...back the hands of time

Deep in there down in your heart
Down in your soul there's something cold
And you feel the misery
And you hear them pray

Overshadowed...history terrifying me
Overshadowed...must we feel this pain
Of the shadows in our soul
It's calling
