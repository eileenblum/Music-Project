She was born in a country place untouched soul, innocent face
Finest education anyone could get with high society wisdom she was fed

Oh no - she is leaving home she ain't ready to leave this idyll
Oh no - she is all alone an illusion of a childhood-thrill

Lost in the streets - a fatal decision
More than real - fantasy destruction
Blinded by light - glamorous confusion
Hide in the dark - shattered illusions

Taking the tray away from her home so excited there was no time to moan
And as she saw the lights of the city they looked at her shining with pity

Oh no - she is leaving home entering the world of enhancing light
Oh no - she is all alone the grab of the city holding her tight

Lost in the streets - a fatal decision
More than real - fantasy destruction
Blinded by light - glamorous confusion
Hide in the dark - shattered illusions

Life beginning to end in a blur - gone away from home
She has left her home forever - lost for all time
She lost her life - to crime and agony she was so blind - overdosed vanity
So disillusioned shattered childhood dreams

The new friends turned out to be fools falling in love with the angel of doom
Deadly poison seeping through her veins (drug bound) - her body for sale

Oh no - she is all alone she has entered the word of light
Oh no - far away from home it's her destiny to lose this fight

Lost in the streets - a fatal decision
More than real - fantasy destruction
Blinded by light - glamorous confusion
Hide in the dark - shattered illusions
