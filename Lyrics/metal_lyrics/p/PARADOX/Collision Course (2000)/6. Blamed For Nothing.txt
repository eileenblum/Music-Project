The hammer has fallen - the sentence has been past
I can't imagine now long time can last
It's just a factor - between birth and death
Left isn't much and it's only getting less

I don't know why but I've been blamed for nothin'
Look at me, I'm unable to move my hands

You're making a big mistake - I'm victim of justice hate
It seems judge and jury forget what justice really is
One way thinking - games with paragraphs
Abusal of law and reckless denial of facts

I don't know why but I've been blamed for nothin'
Look at me, I'm unable to move my hands
I don't know why but I've been blamed for nothin'
I'm not the one I deserve no punishment

Listen, I am innocent - yes I am
There is no reason to repent

I don't know why but I've been blamed for nothin'
Look at me, I'm unable to move my hands
I don't know why but I've been blamed for nothin'
I'm not the one I deserve no punishment

Can't you see I'm no killer - I can prove my innocence
Won't you realize it's impossible to kill with the hand
Witnesses missing - the truth is clear to see
Just no one else to accuse except for me

I don't know why but I've been blamed for nothin'
Look at me, I'm unable to move my hands
I don't know why but I've been blamed for nothin'
I'm not the one I deserve no punishment
Blamed for nothin'
