There is no proof the bringers of death seem to leave their sins behind
Cause their deeds were not observed will be left as unpunished crimes

They got nothing to lose and nothing to win - dead within their lives
Who cares about truth - who cares about sin - who is a killer at large

Look into their eyes

No use for prayers and forgiveness hearts have turned to stone
They don't care, they are aware that they are all alone

This is the age were killers run free denying their own past
Washing their hands but the dirt beneath will forever last

Look into their eyes

Their eyes can't hide the truth...even if they rearrange the past

Historical facts - modificated no consciousness of wrong and right
Memory, history was manipulated horror was changed
Into fairy tales to keep alive

A prophecy we have in store for those about spoken of
We can see the closing door to eternity and peace

Time preceding life is fleeing towards the bitter end
Then they will ask - was is worth all this never again

Look into their eyes

Their eyes can't hide the truth...even if they rearrange the past
Rearrange the past
Rearrange the past
Rearrange the past
