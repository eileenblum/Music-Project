Never saw it any other way - for him it was the truth
He learned it early: the method of denying
When accused - the easiest to say was "no not me"
Pointing the finger at somebody else
Was far from lying

Sealed his fate by denial, never defend - never repent
Life no holding is trial - never again
Here is the end of the path of denial

The reason wasn't personal fear - just a way to get on
Weakness of character - no force to fight
But striving ahead
Instead of standing up - he broke down
And lied like a child
No energy for conflict - no power to arise

Sealed his fate by denial, never defend - never repent
Life no holding is trial - never again
Here is the end of the path of denial

Falling backwards - falling down the stairs of life
Down on the knees - crowling to escape his fate
Crying it out - too late to relieve the soul
Used to be proud - now he's gonna pay his toll

Thronging in fame on the top stair of commerce and society
Nothing was wrong to get get there - reckless for success
Reality lurking to bring him to fall, a silent strike
A little mistake an undercover eye
He couldn't stand the test

Sealed his fate by denial, never defend - never repent
Life no holding is trial - never again
Here is the end of the path of denial
