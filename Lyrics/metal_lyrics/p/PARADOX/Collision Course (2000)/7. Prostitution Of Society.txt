All the things we must achieve
To keep our state alive
A prostitution of society

Truth - is what they calm to say
That it's for the sake - of the human race
Shame - they should be ashamed
They're the ones to blame
When we lose the game

We vote to be free - society - will never die

Fools - are those who still believe
That society is free - it's not reality
The lies - produced by government
Yes I do believe - that we are deceived

We vote to be free - society - will never die

All those word we try to understand
Are all together so irrelevant
Just open your eyes to insanity
And to prostitution of society

Use - your brain to check your soul
You have lost control - you no longer rule
But you - are not the only fool
This is how we work - of which we are the victims

We vote to be free - society - will never die

All those word we try to understand
Are all together so irrelevant
Just open your eyes to insanity
And to prostitution of society

We vote to be free - society - will never die

Control - is what they strain to hold
So they rule alone - an egoistic role
Time - we cannot rewind
But we have to find - salvation from this crime

Now we know it's real - the words we hear
Produce no fear

All those word we try to understand
Are all together so irrelevant
Just open your eyes to insanity
And to prostitution of society
