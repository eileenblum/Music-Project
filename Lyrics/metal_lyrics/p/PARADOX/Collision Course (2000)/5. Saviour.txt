Feel the pressure of this time hear your heartbeat pounding twice
Man's emotions is growing cold always asked but never told
See the colours turn to grey our life has led astray

Life is so complicated - the hope is lost in time
Problems underrated - there is a way
(Out of the dark)

What we need right now is a saviour from these times
To take us far away where our inner child can rise

Now the time is close at hand fate's so hard to understand
Mother earth will take revenge for the spoil and all the stench
Everyday maybe our last remind the shadows of the past

Life is so complicated - the hope is lost in time
Problems underrated - there is a way
(Out of the dark)

What we need right now is a saviour from these times
To take us far away where our inner child can rise

Confidence is hard to find success is all we have in mind
Love and faith are getting rare god help us now we better care
Please release us from our sins and in the end no one wins

Life is so complicated - the hope is lost in time
Problems underrated - there is a way
(Out of the dark)

What we need right now is a saviour from these times
To take us far away where our inner child can rise
