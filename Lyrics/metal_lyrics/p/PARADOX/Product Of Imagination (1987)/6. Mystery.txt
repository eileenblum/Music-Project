Trouble!
I saw in hanging in the night air
Exactly as it shouldn't
I prayed for it to go its own way
Allthrough I knew it wouldn't
Who can I tell
Who would believe me
There's no one else around
Something's changing
It's moving off now
It's not making a sound
Someone tell me I didn't see it
It was only a dream
Oh God! It's moving towards me
I think I shall scream
Where am I now
What am I doing here
What is this thing in the sky
Why does it want me
What have I done here
Why does it come for me now
Who could tell things would turn out this way...tonite!
I know why it's here, it's coming to take me away...tonite!
But why
Mystery
Mystery
Mystery
