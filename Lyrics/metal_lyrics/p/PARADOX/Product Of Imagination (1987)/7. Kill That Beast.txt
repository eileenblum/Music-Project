Massing on the borders
All over this small world
The big red bear is coming
The big red flag unfurls
Spreading mindless terror
Through puppets the world wide
No one really knows for shure
Who is one whose side
Kill...that beast!
Kill...that beast!
The bear is in San Salvador
He's out in Cuba too
He's marching on North Africa
Is there nothing we can do
See the eagle in his nest
Not knowing who its master is
Or is it all the man in power
Or is it a disaster
Kill...that beast!
Stop...the spread!
Kill...that beast!
Rushing through the danger zone
Why can't you see
There's something going wrong
We have to move now
We can't sit back
Just like we have been
Doing far too long
We have the power
Should we use it
No mistakes now
Don't abuse it
Kill that beast!
We saw it in Afghanistan
We can't allow that to happen again
If it doesn't stop now it never will
We all just drown
In the nuclear rain
Nuclear rain
We have the power
Should we use it
No mistakes now
Don't abuse it
Kill that beast!
Kill that beast!
