I'm a genie
From the bottle
A voice upon the raw north wind
I know you
If you hear is good
I'll also know if you have sinned
You can lead me
To a warhorse
See me riding on it's back
All be with you
As you reatreat
I will lead the main attack
Paradox?
No just a lie!
Paradox?
I wonder why
You will feel no joy
You will feel no pain
You'll never see the sun
You'll only feel the rain
I run with the wolves at midnight
I can stop the sun at dawn
I'm a king
A queen, a bishop
You are just my lowly pawn
I sing with the elves of Mirkwood
And I've watched the dragons die
I'm the king beneath the mountain
I'm an eagle in the sky
Paradox?
No just a lie!
Paradox?
I wonder why
You will never feel the power
You will only feel pain
You will never see the sun
Are you insane
Is it only common senses
Ooh it the truth
Tell me, is it all a lie
Do you need to have the proof
Yeah!
Tell!
You will feel no joy
You will feel no pain
You'll never see the sun
You'll only feel the rain
Gangdalf rides
Fair shadowfax
Arathorn strides far and wide
Boromir stands by
The mighty oak tree
A hundred arrows pierce his side
I have formed the highest mountains
I have hurled a storm of rock
The world equates as paradise
To you it's just a paradox
Paradox?
No just a lie!
Paradox?
I wonder why
You will never feel the power
You will only feel pain
You will never see the sun
Are you insane
Insane!
