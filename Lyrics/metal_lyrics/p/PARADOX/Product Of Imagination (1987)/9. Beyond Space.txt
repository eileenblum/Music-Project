Out of time
Out of spacial, space
Out of time
We're a new race
We had to come
Across the nebula
We had to come through
A black star, we're right
We had to fall
Through a time warp
We had to fall
We had to fly
Through a star burst
We had to fly
We were in flight
We could not delay
We were in flight
Each and every day
Oh oh...
Not to worry
There's a new world there
Time to hurry
We may not have to care
If it isn't we will take it anyway
Beyond space, fight
Look!
We haven't come
This far to be scared
We haven't come
This far to be there
We had to fall
Through a time warp
We had to fall
We had to fly
Through a star burst
We had to fly
We were in flight
We could not delay
We were in flight
Each and every day
Oh oh...
We don't worry
We don't even care
Don't have to hurry
It will still be there
If it isn't we'll find in anywhere
Beyond space - we will fight
We had to fly
Through smoke and clouds
We had to fly
Through a storm of dust
We felt that we'd come through hell
We didn't like it
We didn't want to stay
This wasn't what we needed
It wasn't good or right
It wasn't what we wanted
It wasn't light or bright
Oh oh...
No to worry
We have time to spare
Not to hurry
We don't have a care
If it's not good
We'll go anywhere, anywhere
Beyond space - fight!
