The warriors of Asgard fly
Their seeds across the sky
Lightning snaps from shield and sword
The god that never die
Helmets shining
Spears aligning
As they ride
Hallowed knights on golden chargers
Screaming as they say
Pray...to the godz of wrath
Speedin in the silver morning
Sunshine lights their day
Eyes a sparkle, spirits soaring
Nothing bars their way
Helmets shining
Spears aligning
As they ride
Golden gods on golden chargers
Screaming as they say
Pray...to the godz of wrath
Great swords swung against their foes
Cries of battle end the air
Thunder rolls across the sky
Of the gods of wrath beware
Helmets shining
Spears aligning
As they ride
Savage lords on golden chargers
Screaming as they say
Pray...to the godz of wrath
