Take look into the future, a look into the past
Can you realize that we are goin' fast
I feel yesterday was just a second away
But as the seconds flow memories disarray

Our way leads to nowhere, time is a mystery
Our plan is to find it, we're goin' hyperspeed
Our life leads to somewhere, it seems a memory
As we speed to find it we loose the entity

History went by so quickly
A raving, erratic race
Yesterday was bones and stones
Tomorrow: hyperspace
Fantasy to us
The sci-fi-stories only to amuse
Which have become designer blue-prints
Complicated, easy to use

Our way leads to nowhere, time is a mystery
Our plan is to find it, we're goin' hyperspeed
Our life leads to somewhere, it seems a memory
As we speed to find it we loose the entity

Hyperspeed hallucinations
Hyperspeed hallucinations

Tomorrow will be even faster
No way to let thoughts go astray
Concentrate and navigate
Calibrate, don't estimate
Loose your mind then loose your life
Keep it under your control
Push the button, flick the switch
Full speed ahead off we go!

Our way leads to nowhere, time is a mystery
Our plan is to find it, we're goin' hyperspeed
Our life leads to somewhere, it seems a memory
As we speed to find it we loose the entity

Hyperspeed hallucinations
Hyperspeed hallucinations
