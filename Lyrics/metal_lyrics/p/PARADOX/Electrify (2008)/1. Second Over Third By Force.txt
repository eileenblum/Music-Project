You want to piss on my back?
You want to manipulate?
You're just a hollow creature
Constructed to bring hate
Instructed to detest, to destroy and discreate

You want to hollow me out?
You want to suck me in?
You're like a nasty machine
Constructed to destruct

We are just numbers, figures in a game
Can we resist? Or must we back in shame
Who will be first? Who will be last?
Unmistify this: second over third by force

No will to break or change
No reason to believe
No enemy to fight, no one to deceive

We defend our fate
We have to flick the switch
We must resist, in order to exist

We are just numbers, figures in a game
Can we resist? Or must we back in shame
Who will be first? Who will be last?
Unmistify this: second over third by force

We must defend the sacred treasure
We must obey the judgement of heart
First come numbers, then comprehension
Never to remorse, second over third force
THIRD FORCE!

We are just numbers, figures in a game
Can we resist? Or must we back in shame
Who will be first? Who will be last?
Unmistify this: second over third by force

Second over third by force

Power to the fifth or sixth
Glory to those who dare resist
