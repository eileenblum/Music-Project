Conquering time, conquer the world
Spreading death, screaming and pain
Sending our warriors ready to die
Thousands will kill and be slain

To build your monument
To build your monument

No repents, no regrets
It has to be done, to be done
To show the world who is in charge
'I am the immortal one'

Godlike, undead, steadfast,
eternal, holy, fame

Hallowed be thy name
A monument built with death and pain
Indestructible
Built on walls of blood

The battle is won, people enslaved
Cannot fodder for the next strike
Command and obey, no other choice
Subject to the emperor's Reich

To build your monument
To build your monument

Hallowed be thy name
A monument built with death and pain
Indestructible
Built on walls of blood

Who cares - If soldiers have to die
Who cares - If blood is shed for a lie
Who cares - about the next to come,
When creating a monument for the 'one'

Eternity, pride and lust
Perverted killing - fun
Burning skies, bitterness
All for one, and only one

Godlike, undead, steadfast,
eternal, holy, fame

Hallowed be thy name
A monument built with death and pain
Hallowed be thy name
Indestructible
Built on walls of blood
