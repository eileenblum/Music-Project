Racing through the atmosphere
Tiny matter you should fear
Artificial energy strong and fast
Colder than hate fix to blast

And as we scan the sky
We know that we must die
We dare no to defy - electrify
And as we race the night
We know we all must fight
A force of blinding light - electrify

The flick was switched so many years ago
A mission for mankind
Having gone out of control
A trike back operation
Of the fortitude we made
Electrocution of the inventor: immolate

And as we scan the sky
We know that we must die
We dare no to defy - electrify
And as we race the night
We know we all must fight
A force of blinding light - electrify

Lightning strikes the atmosphere
Neutronic power from an outer sphere
Everything to be blown away
What is this force that we lead astray
To splatter us away

And as we scan the sky
We know that we must die
We dare no to defy - electrify
And as we race the night
We know we all must fight
A force of blinding light - electrify
And as we search the night
We recognize in fright
Humanity has committed suicide - electrify
