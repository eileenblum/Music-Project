Some incredible noises are crushing my head
There's no other choice - the code is red

I feel all is in vain
This life is insane

Daily pressure is rising
Search the way to rid the pain
Is it time to give up
Abandon this game?

I feel all is in vain
This life is insane

A call from behind opens my mind
Wake up, step back, unwind!

I turn back to myself
Start anew, ending it all
Step a new into existence
The bridge to silence must fall

Now the time is right to conclude this fight
The future is clear, start right now and here

I feel all is in vain
This life is insane

A call from behind opens my mind
Wake up, step back, unwind!

I turn back to myself
Start anew, ending it all
Step a new into existence
The bridge to silence must fall
