A still life - a life still
A new love - a new kill

Fascination for blood shed
A work of art in blood-red

No! No accusation
Art is free - freedom of art!
Gone is fascination
The shiny red is fading away
Colour the portrait in grey

A still love - a love still
A sharp knife - a sharp will

Silent admiration, unheard, unseen
Fantastic immolation, totally clean

No! No accusation
Art is free - freedom of art!
Gone is fascination
The shiny red is fading away
Colour the portrait in grey

Blood is red or is it grey
It's not the same, it fades away

It gets forgotten, discreate
Shadows fall, dissimulate

No! No accusation
Art is free - freedom of art!
Gone is fascination
The shiny red is fading away
Colour the portrait in grey

Colour the portrait in grey
