I look into a strangers eye as I look into the mirror
Can you see me when I'm looking at you?
Eyes expressing hell - wicked spoiled and sick

Infecting my environment and creeping under skin
Infiltration, domination, alienation from inside

Detect the septic place
Hunting down the trace

Here I'm under skin, now I'm deep within
I crawl through your veins he must be infected

I am feeling a chain reaction
Devouring my mind
While I'm analyzing I'm loosing my sense

Will I win the fight or will I die in pain?

Here I'm under skin, now I'm deep within
I crawl through your veins he must be infected

I am the virus that's creeping through your system
You feel the pain when I'm running through your veins

What is this that grows inside me, devouring my sanity
Can't get hold on it, I can hardly see - unholy source of energy

I need the antidote, the infection's gone irate
Getting devoured from inside is not to be my fate
Disconnect to rid this biomechanical killing machine
Scanning the all systems until I'm virus-clean

Here I'm under skin, now I'm deep within
I crawl through your veins he must be infected
