Where am I now? Where I am here? What has happened to me?
I seem to be somewhere, seem to be unfree
Unhuman cold existence with human conscience
With human feeling and a human soul

Look as I learn now
Watch me decide now
My time is right now
Perfect control, corpse without soul

Seems I'm floating around through hyperspace and time
Falling through an unknown clime
I breathe nothing, no taste, no feeling, lost my mind
I'm in a new, yet explored surrounding: cyberspace

Look as I learn now
Watch me decide now
My time is right now
Perfect control, corpse without soul

I feel observed, analyzed, like an alien thing
Millions of users in front of the screen
I feel no weakness and I begin to understand
I am the master, I am in command

Look as I learn now
Watch me decide now
My time is right now
Perfect control, mechanical soul
A perfect role, separated soul

I'm disconnected
I'm unprotected
