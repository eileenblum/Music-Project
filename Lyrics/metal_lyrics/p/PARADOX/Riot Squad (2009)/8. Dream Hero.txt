Look at me I spit on you you rotten imbeciles
I want you to envy me proud and arrogant style
I show of an MTV pools and cars and rings
I know that you wish to be just like me

Say can you say my name
Feel can you feel my fame
Now open up your eyes
Go it is time to rise

Calling to me
Praying up to me
I am just a dream
In the front row
No looking back
I'm a superhero

The simple things in life to me are just simple waste of time
Why should I criticise myself when I am first in line

All the things I own are just to boast around
All the things that you want aspiration profound
Money ain't the problem a wonderful possession
Showing off all the time - that is my profession
