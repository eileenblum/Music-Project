Always on the run
Trying to escape
But I have begun
Building my own fate

I rely on myself
Alone am I and I got

No place to survive

I deny destiny's help
Told them of my latitude
Goin' on all by myself
Isolation attitude

I deny togetherness
Alone am I and I must survive

Scanning the one who's on the run
Jumpin' the gun
Get the bad guy dead or alive
Criminalized
He chose to be the enemy to society
Hunting the man who won't
Understand all is in our hands

Can't just say what you think
Can't just do what you want
Hiding from authority
Shackles of the free

I defy conformity
I'll find a home even if they say
That I got
