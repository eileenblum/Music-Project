Suburban terror squad
Pollution of the mob
Revolution of lies
A deadly teen war cry

Child by child
Cordiality reviled
Educated fright
No wrong and right

Extreme brutality
Complete egality
Lunatic animosity
A modern tragedy

Malicious and vicious
Aggressive destructive
The youth gone wild and hitting hard
Righteous and pernicious
Oppressive collusive
Suburban terror suburban riot squad

Who cares about forgiveness
Don't search for comprehension
They get right down to business
No fear of adult detention

Who cares about forgiveness
Don't tell them about peace
They get right down to business
Childish rage released

No cares about forgiveness
Don't tell them about peace
They get right down to business
Childish rage released
You can't walk alone
Through the streets of your town
The air is filled with lead
Blood is to be shed
