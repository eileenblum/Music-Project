I don't care about you I don't care about me
I'm in a state of nothingness a state of egality
Where love is lust and life is blood and soberness insanity
And ocean of hate and waves of lies brutal profanity

Thrashed around astray

The more you preach the less you teach all I learn is lies
The more you think the less I conceive ignorance must arise

Thrashed around astray
Toss it all away

Riptide - tearing me down
Riptide - tossing me around
Riptide - pulling me under
Riptide - like rolling thunder

I don't need a government or laws and jurisdiction
I'm my best and only friend charity is insane fiction
Follow me I know what best for those who seek tranquillity
No politics or ethic tricks - salvation is stupidity
