Rotten to the core
Rude and disperspective
Enraged and yet so calm
Protectice and aggressive
Every step is planned
Rude and relentless
Rapid but unseen
The victims and defenseless

False rebellion
Machination
Secrecy
Profanity

To rise in rank

Begging to obey
Obeying to be worshiped
Praying to opprey
Rise with tactical tricks

The harder the climb
The harder the fight
The higher we rise the more
We loose sight
