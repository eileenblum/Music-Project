On the road to ruin
The race to a final end
It will be all over soon
The beginning of the end

Turn back the hands of time
Delete all sweet memory
Swatch back to primitivity
Reset the modern minds
Destroy beloved luxury
Regenerate to plain simplicity

To pollution there's one conclusion
Renewal of evolution
A radical step to save creation
A liderating slavation

Leave it all behind
Solution to mankind
Delete all tech-advance
Shut down the power-plants

As our world collides
There is a resolution
A new hope to arise
To change all constitution

Turn back the hands of time
Delete all sweet memory
Swatch back to primitivity
Reset the modern minds
Destroy beloved luxury
Regenerate to plain simplicity

Switch off electricity
Disclaim to survive
Put and end to luxury
So we can stay alive

Turn back the hands of time
Delete all sweet memory
Swatch back to primitivity
Reset the modern minds
Destroy beloved luxury
Regenerate to plain simplicity
