War a hollow peace
A twisted sadistic nightmare
Antimissile offence
Defending nothing nowhere

Bringer of peace willing to fight
Bringer of war a mission of light
Bringer of peace preparing to fight
Bringer of war the mission is right

Painful hate and greed
Power surge
Inhumanity
Life submerge

No reason to believe in
Hollow peace

It's killing time to save the weak
Need an excuse to kill the weak
It's no difference anyway got to support the industry
Grenades and missiles are made to free

A definition of mankind it was always there
Survival of the strong bringing despair
Those who attack are just defending themselves
A simple excuse delivering hell
