[The hatred that was shown by the crusaders for people who were basically peaceful and the extremes of torture and murder to rid France of the heretics]

Look out Sentry,
We're in a killing mood
Don't stand in our way,
Don't try to slow us down
This is war, seek Divinity
We only want to stop heresy
Terror, hatred, murder
Error, fateful, mistake

No need to shout boy
It won't save your skin now
It's best to prepare
The time must come for all

Terror, hatred. murder
Error fateful, mistake

Don't stop carry on ahead
Don't stop till they are all dead

Minerve die
Cathars fly

Don't stop just swing that sword boy
No one to resist you just forge on

Massacre, Heretics, Cathars
Murder, in the name of the Lord

Blood flows like fire in my brain
Blood flows like water reddened rain
Won't you come and join us
Praise and rejoice us more

If we don't act
And win this war
These heretic bastards
Will be knocking at your door

Massacre, Heretics, Cathars
Murder, in the name of the Lord

If we don't end this blasphemy
The war will reign for centuries
Keep our church free, we will
Massacre these Cathars and make sure
