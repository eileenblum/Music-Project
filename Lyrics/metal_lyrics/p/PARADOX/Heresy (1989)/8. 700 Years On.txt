[How the events of the 13th century are remembered today, and does it really have any boaring on today's society]

A country splintered by religion
Torn by anarchy
Heretics burned for their derision of the holy See
Seven hundred years on

World, do you recall
Just what happened then
Gentlemen and Gentlewomen
Let into the pyre
Seven hundred years ago

Let's think
Images of war
Flashing swords, burning homes
The Albigensian Crusade
See the ruins upon the hills
Just seven hundred years on

So now in nineteen eighty nine
How much do we know
Except for learned scholars
No-one knows at all

Blind
Apathy
Forgotten
A part of history

Flashing swords, burning homes
The Albigensian Crusade
See the ruins upon the hills
Just seven hundred years on

To blind to see that religion's free
Believe what you believe
Established Churches still don't agree
Seven hundred years on

Heresy a different route
From mother church in Rome
See us, we're hurting no-one
Why can't you leave us alone

Hunted
Persued
Burnt
Marched into the fire
Oh, then!
