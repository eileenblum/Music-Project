[From the 11th to the 13th century a particular religious sect was allowed to grow in the Languedoc region of France. Called Catharism this dualist thinking religion flourished, not only with the poor but also people like the Counts of Toulouse and the great Esclarmonte of Foix. In the early part of the 13th century the Pope petitioned the king to form. a crusade and vanquish the heretics. This petitioning finally led to the Albigensian Crusade. A force of Knights and Mercenaries besieged the Cathars and in a massive pyre at Montsegur massacred some 200 of them virtually eliminating Catharism in Southern France]

Heresy

The beginning.
How the believers of the dualist theory turned there backs on Catholicism
and found their own methods of embracing God

They started on a distant shore
The rich believing with the poor
Fighting, striving hard to seek
A higher power with something else to say

Spreading their belief
Praying for a life
It's the perfect way
But to the church it's just called heresy

Heresy

Heretics, that and nothing more
Daring to renege on our Gods law
It's wrong for them to feel this way
Detrimental for the soul
Help them through this time
Disregard these lies

They say the perfect way
But to the church it's just called heresy
Heresy
Yeah Choose!

Cathars gaining more control
The choice is free, us or holy Rome
Join with us you'll see the light
We have a holy Right

It's the perfect way
But to the church it's just called heresy
Heresy, heresy, heresy
Choose!
