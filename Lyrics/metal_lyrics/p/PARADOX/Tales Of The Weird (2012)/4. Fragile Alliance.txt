There's darkness all around
They draw the curtain over
My body and my life is gone
Anybody, help me out!
Coz I'm fallin' and fallin'
All is still, I can hear if you're calling
Something's tearing me down

I'm losing all my memories
Life turns away from gentle peace
Stay! But another picture fades away

Now there's no more friends to lose
Throwin' light upon my lifetime
I'm supposed to break in two
Fade away!
What I feel is an empty head
But I'm tryin' and tryin'
Not to lose, not to leave and forget
Make my whole life a lie

I'm losing all my memories
Life turns away from gentle peace
Stay! But another picture fades away

Fragile alliance, of that I know
Getting less, takin' me over
Fragile alliance, body and soul
Broken mind, getting cold
Fragile alliance, of that I know
Getting less, takin' me over
Fragile alliance, body and soul
Broken mind, getting cold
So cold!

Some day depression comes hard
A slap in my face
Drifting, no haven in sight
All alone I have to fight

Down and tired â I'm blown away now
Down and tired â deep in the storm
Down and tired âthere's harm inside me, telling me
You should not have been born, have been born!

And I say: "Anybody, help me out!"
Because I'm fallin' and fallin'
All is still, I can hear if you're calling
This is breaking me down

I'm losing all my memories
Life turns away from gentle peace
Stay! But another picture fades away

Fragile alliance, of that I know
Getting less, takin' me over
Fragile alliance, body and soul
Broken mind, getting cold
Fragile alliance, of that I know
Getting less, takin' me over
Fragile alliance, body and soul
Broken mind, getting cold
So cold!
