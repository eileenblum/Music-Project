War, infernal core, business, not more, blood spattered fame.
For I sell the death, march on the path of vice and pain.
Escalation, exaltation to kill.

Hunt, bombers and guns, warlords have won, before they fight.
Arms, rockets and tanks, the means on the bank tell me, I'm right!
Escalation, exaltation...

Carnivores and marauders, that's what I saw.
My equipments, I promise, decide your war!
Escalation of violence, state power's gone.
Domination of malice, the battle's done, done, done, lost and won.

We raid you, 'til you have paid the price of your fate.
Survive, if you're bold!
Kill, charge and fulfill contract and bill that we have resolved!
Escalation, exaltation...

Carnivores and marauders, that's what I saw,
My equipments, I promise, decide your war!
Escalation of violence, state power's gone.
Domination of malice, the battle's done, done, done, lost and won.
