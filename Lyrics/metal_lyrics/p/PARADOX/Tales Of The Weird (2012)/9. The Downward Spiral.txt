Heaven knows I'm not blind
Can't adhere without a mind
Heaven breaths another sigh
Hesitate what I seek
Terminate society
Heaven weeps another cry

Sail me sober
Stray me closer

Heaven knows I'm alive
Motivate what's inside
Heaven breaths a passive sigh
Can't escape reality
Never wake a fantasy
Heaven weeps another cry

"Tormented screams, that only I can hear
I thrust myself into the black hole and fall through the depths
Sinking Deeper, Becoming Weaker
Will I Wake... I Break..."

Heaven knows this,
Can I beat this hell?
Have I known this
Enough to save myself
Have you noticed,
Another signal's down,
You're barely focused,
I shy away

Heaven knows I'm not blind
Can't adhere without a mind
Heaven screams another cry
