From the darkest hole, the eye of the storm
Creatures creeping out, hungry and reborn
Anguish in their faith, their believe
Conquest and disease

Fear takes over, reason should not, but it fails
Thrill of malice, inquisitivness prevails

Hands snatching at us so cruel
Will they get us and kill?
No! We will grow up and spread the thrill

Tales of the weird, horror and fear
Parts in us love it!
Blood thirsty nights, no rules
But fights for heir apparent

Entering your skull with depravity
Lord takes you aside finally you are free!
What is awesome rush overtaking all!
One time comes the call!

Your time's over! Speeding furious â gone!
Hard impact, but you knew that this time would come

Hands snatching at us so cruel
Will they get us and kill?
No! We will grow up and spread the thrill

Tales of the weird, horror and fear
Parts in us love it!
Blood thirsty nights, no rules, but fights
Cowards attack from behind!

Pounding, scorching, crushing, recharging hate
Amdness, roughness, distress, confess to your fate
Tales of the weird

Lord will make you pay sins and bills
Sword of Damocles sure is falls and kills
Life is leaving you, maybe now it's time
Finally you decline!

Your times over, karma judges you
You were takin', never givin' that is true

Hands snatching at us so cruel
Will they get us and kill?
No! We will grow up and spread the thrill

Tales of the weird, horror and fear
Parts in us love it!
Blood thirsty nights, no rules
But fights for heir apparent
Tales of the weird, coming so near
Just trace the world-news
U.S. make it real, one minute, one kill
Tales of the weird, they are near
