There's oil and gas detected in the sea
And they need tons of it to move their goods
Oil tankers break in two periodically
And death is playin his melody

Out of sight, out of mind, waste pollute the sea
Who's to die the brutal kind?

We deserve the blackened rose
Tons of trash won't decompose
Money's reigning in your head
You don't care, you slash her death!
Slash!

The timber trade, good for the company
The Amazonian forest offers much
There's hunt and trade of threatened animals
In so much ways, we can not see!

Greed for cash and avarice, lumberjacks arrive
They don't care, who will survive

We deserve the blackened rose
Tons of trash won't decompose
Money's reigning in your head
You don't care, you slash her death!

Death commandos operate
Worldwide and decide your fate
Stand up and frustrate their plan!
Earth recuperates again

Atomic waste disposal underground
Nuclear reactors â an eternal risk
We do not have complete control of it
The folks demand to shut' em down

Hell, infernal overkill
The danger is latent
People start to comprehend

We deserve the blackened rose
Tons of trash won't decompose
Money's reigning in your head
You don't care, you slash her death!
Slash us dead!

Slash!
Slash!
Slash!
Slash!
Slash!
Slash!
