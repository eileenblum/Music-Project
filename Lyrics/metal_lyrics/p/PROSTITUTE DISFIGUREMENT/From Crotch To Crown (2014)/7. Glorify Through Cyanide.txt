God is among us
Reckon his true divinity
Follow the line
Of father divine

Jonestown sect of the holy
Pentecostal congregation
Congregation of the dead
Sacramental ceremony
In the temple of the damned

The last supper
All here to serve
For the love of god
Only one way to end
Never to sin again
Never to live again
Destruction of the holy
Heavenly deceptor's plan

To die in revolutionary suicide
Is to live forever

Drinking the potion
Speaking in tongues
Venomous psalms
Chanting intoxicating praises

White night
White night
Rehearsal suicide
White night
White night
Glorify through cyanide

The guilt of the dead
Outshining them all standing in line sing and praises
Please hold hands and die
Massive scale of the blessed all be one with their god
Mass suicide
Sets in leave 914 dead
To die in revolutionary suicide is to live forever

Jonestown massacre
All here to serve
Cyanide poisoning of the blessed
Sucking down their dixie cup
And willing to meet thy maker
We're all going to die 
There's a great dignity in dying
It's a great way to end our struggle
And please die with some dignity

The temple's religion turned into dust
If you are lucky you'll get out alive
If you try to run or hide
You'll get a bullet instead of cyanide!
