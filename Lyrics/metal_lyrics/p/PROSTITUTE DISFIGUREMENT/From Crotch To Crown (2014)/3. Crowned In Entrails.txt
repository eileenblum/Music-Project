Something festers inside of me
A secret identity that breeds in me
With an urge to rape and murder constantly
Laying dormant too long now finally set free
Picking my victims at random
As I lurk in the dead of night
I'm hidden from every sight
Until I find the one just right

I watched her eyes drop to my shaft of steel
Buried in her belly above the pubic triangle
She looked at my hands as I pulled the blade up
She saw her entrails slid out of her belly

Entrails gush to the ground
Followed by her body her entrails form a mound
In her own entrails she's crowned

Explosive adrenaline pulsing through my veins
Complete feelings from this act I receive
I climaxed on the hot steaming pile of jelly

Chopping at her face in hate
Eyes wide open staring from a mangled face
Vagina bit in retribution
Her labia removed exposed in disgrace

Turned unto her back
Her ass invaded her crotch stimulated
Anally mutilated after death
Her bluish lifeless body for several hours penetrated
Carved up from anus to chin

Cause of death asphyxiation overpowered by strangulation
Creep up from the back, cord around her neck
I devour one by one
Stabbed and pounded faces
All life withered away in decay
Bodies discarded without a trace
Only taste for more death remains

I watched her eyes drom to my shaft of steel
Buried in her belly above the pubic triangle
She looked at my hands as I pulled the blade up
She saw her entrails slid out of her belly
Picking my victims at random
As I lurk in the dead of night
I'm hidden from every sight
Until I find the one just right

Embarked on my killing spree
My face you will never see
Carving up whores my destiny
Born to kill for all eternity
