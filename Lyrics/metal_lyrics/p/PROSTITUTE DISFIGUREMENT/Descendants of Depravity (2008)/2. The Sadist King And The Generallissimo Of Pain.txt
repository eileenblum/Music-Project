All crumble beneath their feet
Feeding on a global misanthropy
Fear and misery line their plate
Pain and suffering just makes it great

The gods of ghastly supremacy
indulged in sadistic depravity
Go through excitements of bestiality
Absorbed in sickening insanity

Sacrificial strangulations
Massacred without mercy
Slaughtered for pleasure
By the subliminal terror spawn

They are the destroyers of the World
They are diseased in the mind
They are the misanthropic force
The darkest side of humanity

The gods of ghastly supremacy
indulged in sadistic depravity
Go through excitements of bestiality
Absorbed in sickening insanity

They are your husbands, they are your sons
They're everywhere and there will be more
Of your children dead tomorrow
You spread the word, they spread the sorrow

A megalomaniac duo
Yearning for grotesque recognition
Unspeakable acts arising
From bloodshed ruled oppression

They are the destroyers of the World
They are diseased in the mind
They are the misanthropic force
The darkest side of humanity

Sacrificial strangulations
Massacred without mercy
Slaughtered for pleasure
By the subliminal terror spawn
