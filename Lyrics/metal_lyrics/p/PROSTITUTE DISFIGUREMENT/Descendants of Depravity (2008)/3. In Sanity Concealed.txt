I'm called the one-eyed drifterA cross-country odyssey of crimeAdvocate of different methodsMy cruelty seems to know no bounds While you sleep, I destroy your worldBecoming a merciless killing machineMurder to rob and eliminate witnessesRape as a tool of punishment Fulltime arsonistDevil worshipping cultistChronic alcoholicBestial and depravedHitman for "The Hand of Death"Raping and killing saintsIn service to this cult Female targets of violent outburstsI expose the terrible realities of existenceEnjoy the transient feeling of powerI'm the exploiter of murder an mayhem Look down on me,You will see a foolLook up to me,You will see your lordLook straight at me,You will see yourselfI'm the sickening of humanityConcealed in sanity My cold blooded natureBeneath a veil of charmsI'm a master in dissemblingMy true monstrous face A prodigy of wickedness,Hollow to the coreMurdered, raped and burnedMy way through the stateDetermined to raise hellAnd spreading fearDay by day,My twisted life if hate
