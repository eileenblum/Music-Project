[Lyrics: Patrick]

BAthed in cum, she heads for the shower
Unknowing the twist of faith, her final hour

Bloodlust haunting me, leaving me no choice
Yearning for her blood, my only fucking rehoice

Your pain... Blood release me!
Your screams... Are futile bitch!
Had her last load, up her face
Another whore's life, will now be erased

Welcome sluts
Welcome to my world of pain
For you'll be my monument
My monument of death's decay

Pissing in a gaping hole
Where her chest used to be
Leaving a grimace on my face
Caouse this abhorrent delight releases me

Release me, release from the voices
Voices, voices in my head
Till these voices again
With blood have to be fed

Gutting her, slice her to bits
Blood squirts all over me
While I lick what's left to her tits

Cutting up her cunt, slice of every limb
Using her asshole, as a fleshly cock ring

Welcome sluts
Welcome to my world of pain
For you'll be my monument
My monument of death's decay

Pissing in a gaping hole
Where her chest used to be
Leaving a grimace on my face
Caouse this abhorrent delight releases me
