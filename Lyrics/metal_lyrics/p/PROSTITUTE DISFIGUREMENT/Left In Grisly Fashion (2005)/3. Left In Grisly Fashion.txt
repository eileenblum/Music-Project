[Lyrics: Niels]

Torn to shreds in the sickest form
Lacerations to the bone
Mutilated after dead
Draped over the tombstone
Torso impaled through the spine
Chest cracked open wide
Unveiling all the organs
Rotting from inside

Left in grisly fashion

Maggots digesting
Consuming flesh
Eruption of cysts
Smell the rotting dead
Inside twisting
Underneath bloated skin
Cempelling ravaged bodies
Stir perversities within

Left in grisly fashion. Corpses for my recreation
Left in grisly fashion. Become monuments of mutilation

Savage butchery
Ripped, cut and torn
Pits of corpses
In bloated form
Slashed and dismembered
Worm infested whore
Left in grisly fashion
Embalmed a week before

[Solo: Roel]

Left in grisly fashion. Corpses for my recreation
Left in grisly fashion. Become monuments of mutilation

At this putrid paradise at night
I wake the dead from their sleep
I unearth the buried ones
No sympathy for the deceased
Grisly masterpiece
Paradise of putrefaction
Remnants of the dead
For my ghastly collection
