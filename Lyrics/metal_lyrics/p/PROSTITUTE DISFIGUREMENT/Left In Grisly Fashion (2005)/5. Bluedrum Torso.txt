I defy the living, fouled the gift of life
To build my shrine of death
Carnage and dismemberment I strife
Only here I find sanctity

Acid filled thoughts
I'm out of control
The dead viscera I Fuck
After I lured them for a buck

Blue drum torso
And corpses in my tub
All I want is some company
And with me you'll forever be

drunk and incoherent
I drugged them to die
Photographs lying around
Of dismembered human bodies

Subsequent dismemberment of the body
To be kept as a trophy
Performing oral or anal sex
Whether alive or dead

Smell of decomposition
Polaroid pictures taken
At various stages of death
Here you'll take your last breath

cut open torso
In my blue drum table
On skull masturbation
For gratification
