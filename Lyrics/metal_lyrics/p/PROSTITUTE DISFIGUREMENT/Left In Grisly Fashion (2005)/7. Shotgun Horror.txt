[Lyrics: Niels]

Day of darkness, hatred burns my soul
Numb and indifferent, dark side takes control
Living abomination, reject of society
You mark my words, I'm the last one you'll see
Haunting the innocent gives me a thrill
Sick and depraved shooting people at will

I open fire on the crowd
Dying people, vomiting blook, screaming loud
I watch their blood spill and spurt
Bodies lying limb and twitching in the dirst

There is no escape
For the fucking ones I hate
I'll gun you down tonight
Don't try to run and hide
Victims shot in a row
People are dying slow
Can't control my twisted mind
A trail of corpses left behind

Day of darkness, hatred burns my soul
Numb and indifferent, dark side takes control
Haunting the innocent gives me a thrill
Sick and depraved shooting people at will
My final day, the best I ever had
Mass murder rampage, I'll kill until I'm dead
