[Lyrics: Patrick]

All that's left
Are facial impressions
Of bitches that left me
Caused the corroding of my sanity
Desperation surrounds me like a veil

Living in the prison of flesh
A shell of imperfection
Well, fuck you bitch!
If I can't have an erection

Exploring of a mind so numb
What's the way for me to cum?
Copulation doesn't work for me
Is scarlet the color that roughs me

Pale fingers stroke my cavity
Where normally a cock used to be
Amputated hands in my bed
As I sit on her decapitated head

Your bloody but cheeks in my face
Your mockeried lead to disgrace
Now all you bitches feel my hurt
If you're never seen a hole squirt

[Solo: Roel]

Your bloody but cheeks in my face
Your mockeried lead to disgrace
Now all you bitches feel my hurt
If you're never seen a hole squirt
