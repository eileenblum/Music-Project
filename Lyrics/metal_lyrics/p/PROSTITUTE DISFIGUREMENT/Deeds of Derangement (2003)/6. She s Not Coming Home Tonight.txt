She went out for a cuddle and a kiss
She was beaten up and picked up for a horrible ride
She vanished of the street one cold Decembernight

Woman in decay â Mom Iâm home early okay!
Woman in decay â Murdered in a grisly way
Woman in decay â Her parents can only pray
Woman in decay â The hearse is taking her away

Dead human collection at my home
A hidden hell, my own realm of sickness
Upon the meathook slowly slicing her, I watch her bleed
I masturbate while her blood streams

She knows sheâs not coming home tonight
The blade touches her flesh her face is stiff of fright

My insanity becomes my depravity
Brutal vile attack, bloody gruesome deeds

She knows sheâs not coming home tonight
The blade touches her flesh her face is stiff of fright

Smashing in her face, she screams and moans
Dehumanized, complete body sliced
Sliced up for a bag, bloody bags to drag
My mutilated grace, disfigured gruesome ways
