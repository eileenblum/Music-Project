Bring unto them their worst
They stand together as one of their brotherhood
Fed from the food of their morals
Colonized and accepted ideals raised into society
A matter of time is only needed:
The village will collapse upon itself, a twisted colony of beautiful perfection [2x]
Corrupt by fake ideals and a faux path to safety [2x]
The village will bring destruction, branching outward towards every last crevice of the earth
How can you justify this? [2x]
The disgust of ego married with arrogance dressed in white
A grotesque picture praised by the village like a false idol
The village will bring violence
Violence will bring destruction
Destruction will bring your end
The village is you, composed of your ideals, composed of your lies
Composed of your ideals, composed of your lies...
Bring forth the depths, swallow this village whole.
