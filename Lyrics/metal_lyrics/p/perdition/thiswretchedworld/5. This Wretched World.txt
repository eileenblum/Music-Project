A small boy lost within himself
Confined to his home and sought by doom
Death has taken what he loves. He is alone. He is alone.
He delves within himself learning his own raw power:
Miraculous gifts rewarded by rare religious insight as the boy grew
The dark side of himself emerged, practicing every form of depravity
Vile acts lead to isolation [2x]
He is alone, he is alone...
Capable of healing the sick and reading thoughts, he can sense fear, he knows who you are
With an apathetic word he can control you too
By candlelight demoralization grew
Saintly power corrupt by wretched intent [2x]
I had the misfortune to stumble across this man
A dark hooded figure, giving the essence of expiry
With a twisted finger pointed at my heart, he raised his head
And spoke to me....
I am death
This is the end.
