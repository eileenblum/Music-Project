Have you been caught up to date?
Been persecuted by reality?
This is not a game, this is your fucking life
Dig your knife deeper into the flesh of humanity
I guarantee we will fight back
We do not tolerate you
We will oppress anything that might spit from your throat
I cannot relate to you
You are a murderer
How's it feel to know that you were the only one inside
You're the one that will hide this horrible thing you cannot deny
You were what went wrong in society
The perfect plan, spoiled by corruption
You are no longer welcome to me
You're a fucking murderer
It should have been you
