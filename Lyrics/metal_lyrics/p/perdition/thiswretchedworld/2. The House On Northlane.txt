[feat. Shea Moll from Autumn Of Terror]I am a survivor of the house on the corner
I have survived the house on Northlane [2x]
The house on the corner is a place wrought with dread
Just the thought of that place instills doubt in my head
I can hear them like a vice I've fed
I was kept between one man of heaven and one man of hell
Deep within that dark twisted house; it is a place I will never return
For the one sought by hell so often spoke and told me to let him free me
But the one touched by heaven who rarely formed words told me I'm already free
I can still hear the evil one, my sanity cannot be found [2x]

[Shea:]
"I am your end
This is the last fucking face you'll see
Your screams are useless cries of desperation
What once was good has faded from my heart
All that's left is a broken shell
I feel it tearing in me, who will prevail?"
I could not decide who I ought to believe
So then from Northlane I decided to leave.
I may have escaped but I am still haunted by the two who invade my mind
Who am I to believe?
