You will tremble with fear.
I am in control of this place,
This kingdom i call my home.
This world i have created.
You cannot escape my grasp,
Nothing can escape the black hole of my subconscious.
There is no room for sanity, here in this metropolis of madness.
The sun the moon and I; a perfect trinity. We will drown the world in sadness, if we say it is to be.
Nothing can survive, if we do not allow it to live.
Not even the rivers will flow, while we are in control.
Give me a reason to differ your fate from the cowards.
Oh god what have I become?
My power is only limited, by what i cannot imagine.
I can see the world and its' past from my throne of the exiled.
I can see the pyramids rise from the sand, and the oceans swallow the land.
I can see the world, here from my throne of sorrow.
I can see the world.
From this throne of the exiled
It is the end.
