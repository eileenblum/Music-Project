Pussy tight, tonight, pussy tight

Just keep it coming just keep me pleased,
If you know what is good for you, you will be looking for me 
I know you know I can please
Last night was crazy got in a fight Saturday night
But tonight Daddy is going to make it right 
Slip and dance with me all night

Pussy tight, tonight, pussy tight

Coors light on ice, she is getting right
She is feeling my rise do not stop roll the dice, 
She is got my rod in her thighs
Tonight feels crazy, open the tight you know I might
Call me at day I cannot fucking wait!
That is supposed to feels like I can handle all right?

Pussy tight, tonight, pussy tight
