We wanna live our life forever each day. 
To burn your candle at both ends. 
Mach 10 velocity not slowing down at all. 
Your metal heart just never bends. 

Ah!

Don't stop to wait for life just burn it to the ground. 

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.

Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.

Live hard, die great, burn it down!

As the years go by.
The road gets very steep.
It's time to stand or fall.
Can't leave my politics and words, honestly.
It took you going, after all.

Ah! 

Don't stop to wait for life just burn it to the ground. 

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.

Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.

Live hard, die great, burn it down!

Show 'em now!

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.

Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.

Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.

Live hard, die great, burn it down!
