She's the talk of the town
gets around

Love her, leave her
For all the wrong reasons
Love her, leave her
You might even

Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your bed?
Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your head?

Out on the streets
She ain't got enough to eat
Making a living off your time

Love her, leave her
For all the wrong reasons
Love her, leave her
You might even

Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your bed?
Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your head?

[Solo]

Wooh!

Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your bed?
Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your head?

Who's been your latest lover?
(Your latest lover)
Who's been in your bed?
Who's been your latest lover?
Who's been in your head?
