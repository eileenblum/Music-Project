Under the light
The way I feel
Everbody making such A big deal

I do the things on my own way
but this but this is it
do it moving on
while you been singing that same old song
it's Not for me
it's Not for you

Now if youll do ill do
all the things That I'll do babe

I'll be alright
Just give me a chance
I'll be alright
till got it above the ground

can't repeat it I'll never be the same
and one of these days out with that game
it doesn't like it i don't who don't
in other twelve is on her who wonder now

do it now moving on
and you keep playing that same old song

was the new hell thing all satisfied
but you know that you have pack them

I'll be alright
until give me a second chance
I'll be alright
because got it above the ground

[Solo]

I'll be alright
Just give me a chance
I'll be alright
because got it above the ground

baby! baby!!

I'll be alright babe

I'll be alright!!
