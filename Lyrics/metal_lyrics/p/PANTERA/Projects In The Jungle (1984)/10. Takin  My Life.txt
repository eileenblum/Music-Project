I can see
I know it was meant to be
You can be what you want to be
Just set yourself free

Oh my life
Been trying so hard to get it right
Been searching in the night
Trying to set myself free

Now I can't turn my back and walk out the door
Now that I know found out what I'm living for

I'm taking my life into my own hands
Got to be strong got to be a man
Takin' my life

No No No
No more no more living in a mystery
I'm not going to let it get the best of me
Takin' my life

I can see
I know it was meant to be
You can be what you want to be
Just set yourself free

Now I can't turn my back and walk out the door
Now that I know found out what I'm living for

I'm taking my life into my own hands
Got to be strong got to be a man
Takin' my life
No No No
No more no more living in a mystery
I'm not going to let it get the best of me
Takin' my life
