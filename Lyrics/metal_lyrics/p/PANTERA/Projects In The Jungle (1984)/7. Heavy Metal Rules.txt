All my life, it's been the sameToo many rules if you wanna play the gameDon't do this, don't do thatYour mom and dad, they know where it's atI'll show 'em all, a thing or twoI found a game I know how to doPut on your leather, snap on your spikesMe and the boys are hot rockin' tonightI'll stick my fist, high in the airI'll make a sign, 'cause I don't careHeavy Metal Rules! It's the same corruption, everywhere I lookThere's a brand new rule inside a brand new bookSome people claim that the devil is looseThey blame it all on the rock 'n' roll youthThat don't stop me, I'm on a rollI found the noise, bangin' my soulSo take it up, loud as you canThere's just one rule that I understandI'll stick my fist, high in the airI'll make a sign, 'cause I don't careHeavy Metal Rules!
