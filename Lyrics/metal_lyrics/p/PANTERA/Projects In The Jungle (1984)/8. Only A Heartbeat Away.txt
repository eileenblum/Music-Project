I remember the first time your lips met mine
We were young and innocent, we had plenty of time
The years have gone and passed us by, don't run and hide
Think of all the things we had, and what you're feeling inside
Feeling inside
Take me, take all of my love
Take me, I can give you so much
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away

So close, but so far away,
You say you love me, but you can't stay
Hear me now, we're wasting time
Take a chance, loves on the line
Love's on the line
Take me, take all of my love
Take me, I can give you so much
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away
