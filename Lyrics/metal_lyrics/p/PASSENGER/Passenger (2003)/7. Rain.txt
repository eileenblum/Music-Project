We got to give them someting
It is time to crawl
You go to lend us the moment
And you'll have a rewind for life

Who do we blame?
For this rain
Is this just another breakdown?
Who do we blame?
For this rain
Why dont we stop and just let go?

We got to take away something
It is time to fall
You go to lend us the moment
You're in a rewind for life
