Cut through the silence
I'm  shaking
I'm ready but I'm still waiting
Everything is coming back around
I'm praying
I'm lying
Like I've never done anything else

Emptiness is all I find
When I.....
See through the eyes of my mind

I can't tell you anything
About the early hours
I'm sober now
Don't ask me how
Used to have endless day
