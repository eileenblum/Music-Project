What would you sacrifice for reality?
Is it important what we used to be?

Looks like I got here first
Offer a king and I'll invite you in
Spend carnival money
Because tomorrow wont be as sunny

Praise you
I cant change you
When I try to

Above it all
We end up somewhere
If we're equal
We could go far
Dim the lights
We're everything
The day we try to bend it
(We fall) like any other star

Would you save this moment for another day?
If youre told maybe and thats all the say

Cross the waters to the silent
Focus on love
A golden dove
Wake up (to) a new day
Lets climb to the top
