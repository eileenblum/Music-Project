Pacing around in circles
Talking to himself
He could see the beauty there
Talking to another one

She came to see our city
She came in the dead of the night
I tried to introduce him
But she got scared and ran away

They came, thousands from far away
They came a sunny day
I tried to introduce him
Now I'm talking to myself
I tried to introduce him
Now I am the one talking to myself
