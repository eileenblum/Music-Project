("Don't think too much. Feel. Feel. You'll go insane if you think too much.")

Mental illness is not a name
To be abused for fortune or fame
Mental illness is notâaâgame
There are noâwinners â don't bother to play

Hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt

Of all the approaches that you could have chosen
(That you could have chosen),
This has got to be the lowest of the lowest
(Of the lowest)

(Huh) I bet you think that you've seen it all,
But you don't know the half, 'cause all you do is
Play the part
But we can see right through your lifeless act

Anxiety is not a calling card (calling card)
Have you ever had a suicidal thought?
And depression is not a fashion statement;
It's just a matter of time until you get caught

So, don't pretend
To understand (Ohhoohoohoohh)
You can't pretend
To understand (Ohhoohoohoohh)

(Oohhoohhoohhooh
Oohhoohh)

You want to see crazy? I'll show you crazy
I've been diagnosed with everything in the book
But you â night after night, living a fictional life you don't believe in
It's going to catch up with you one of these days
You can only fake it for so long
You can only lie to so many kids
Karma bows to no man
Do it!

Don't pretend to understand
Those scars are painted on
Don't pretend to understand
You're not fooling anyone

Mental illness is not a trend
You want to tempt fate? Go right ahead
Mental illness is not a fad
You want to taunt death? You'll wish you never had

("- lovin', baby.
Don't you weep, pretty baby.
Don't you weep, pretty baby.")
