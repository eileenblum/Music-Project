The last time we listened,
The last time we listened to you,
We decided to forfeit,
But nowâwe'reâhere, and we'veâgot something to prove

NO, we willânever die
NO, we will never die
NO â let me hear your voices
One more time
NO, we willânever die
NO, we will never die
NO â we're screaming this
'Til we're buried alive â I said I'mâ¦

Still alive
Yeah, I'm still alive
You know I'm still alive,
And I'm not giving up without a fight

It's time to let go
It's time to let go of you
We're just sick of the torment;
It's too much after all we've been through

You can't tell me I'm terminal,
('Cause I'm not done here yet)
You can't force me to burn it all,
('Cause we're not done here yet)

Kill me if you can, kill me if you can
Kill me if you can, 'cause you know you can't
Kill me if you can, kill me if you can
Oh! Yeah, you know you can't

Still alive
Yeah, we're still alive
You know we're still alive,
And we're not giving up without a fight

And I've stared death
In both of her eyes
And I've cried my way
Through my sweet goodbyes
And I've tried suicide
And made up my mind
I'd rather stand up and live
Than lay down and die

Still alive
Still alive
Oh! You know we're still alive
