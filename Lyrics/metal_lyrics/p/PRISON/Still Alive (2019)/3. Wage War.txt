("I hate war.")

Hurt, hurt, hurt (hurt)

(Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!)
(3x)
(Huh! Huh!) Oh!

We are a temporary plague
In an eternal nightmare
We're bred toâhate,âbut we ignoreâthe pain we cause
And pretend toâfight fair
FEED, feed the war machine
Until we've no arms left to bear,
Then we feign regret and pray to any god
That our trivial lives are spared, BUTâ¦

Everything you know and love will die (because)
Everything you swear by is a lie

We fight for PEACE, we kill for PEACE,
Yet we embrace war
WAR, WAR,
War is what we live for
We fight for PEACE, we kill for PEACE,
Yet we embrace war
WAR, WAR
Let's start another war

You're starting a war,
You're starting a war,
You're starting a war,
You're starting a war that you can't win

Ooh!

("Everything you know and love will die.")

(Oh!) (Rghh!)
(Uh!)
(Oh!) (Ah! Ah!) (Oh!) (Ah! Ah!)
(Oh!) (Ah! Ah!) Uh!

We are a temporary plague
In an eternal nightmare
We're bred toâhate,âbut we ignoreâthe pain we cause
And pretend toâfight fair
Start a war
You've started a war
You've started a war that you can't win

We fight for PEACE, we kill for PEACE,
Yet we embrace war
WAR, WAR,
War is what we live for
We fight for PEACE, we kill for PEACE,
Yet we embrace war
WAR, WAR
Let's start another war

Fight, kill, start a war
Fight, kill, start a war
