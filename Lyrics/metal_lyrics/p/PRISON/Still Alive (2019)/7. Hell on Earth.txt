One morbid, festering heap
Of ignorance and waste
What better way to reconcile
Than to throw it allâaway?â(You say)
No recourse,âno recovery
For the solar system's stain
ButâI'm putting in all the work,
Yet no one knows my name,

But you'll know my name

I search for the silver lining
On the billowing mushroom cloud
That envelops the entire planet;
Mother Earth's entrancing shroud

I breathe
In my final breath â uh!
I breathe,
I breathe in my final breath as I watch itâ¦

Burn, burn, burn
Hell on Earth ("Prolonged exposure to fallout will result in certain death.")

Burn, burn, burn
Hell on earth

Isn't this what you wanted?
Isn't this what you said in your prayers?
Isn't this what you asked for?
Isn't this what you taught to your kids?

Your wish (your wish)
Is my command
I hold the world
In the palm of my hand

Burn

(Careful what you wish for) (Careful what you wish for)
[14x]
