("I'm Jesse, and I've survived [â¦]")

Huh huh

Pray for me â feel
Pray for me

Huh â locked inside this prison
Hurt
Locked inside this prison
Hurt â rghh!

("Iâhaveâseen war. I haveâseen war on land and sea. Iâhave seen blood
running from the wounded. I have seen children starving. I have seen the
agony of mothers and wives.")
