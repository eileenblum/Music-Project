[This song is dedicated to anyone who has struggled with the loss of a loved one.]

Hurt
Kill

I've been trying to find my friends
But I forgot they're all in my head
I've been trying to kill myself
But I forgot I'm already dead

And I would die a thousand deaths
Before I'd live again
I could have eternal life
But I choose death instead

I choose death
Or did death choose me?

I've been looking around
And all I see is sanity
Where did I go wrong?
What is this secret you keep?
Why am I so weak?
What is this sickness in my speech?

I've been trying to look myself in the mirror and say
That I'm okay with who I am and where I've been and what I've done
But I'm such a bad liar
I've been trying to look myself in the mirror and say
That it's okay, that I'm still straight, that I'm just fine
But I don't trust this tongue of mine

Do it
Kill
Face down on the concrete
I always said I'd never shed a tear for dead meat
