[This song is dedicated to anyone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts.]

I'm a bridge torcher
A tortured performer
A victim of abuse who is shorter when cornered
If there's one thing I know, it's that I'm never enough, butâ¦

I've got a knife in my hand and a dying dream
Oh, yes, I've got a knife in my hand and a dying dream

God in Heaven
I need divine intervention
To escape this detention
At least divert my attention
I've got the right intentions

I'm just sick
Yeah, I'm sick in the head
And every morning I wake up
I curse and I wish I was dead

Everything I touch, it turns to rust
And everything I love crumbles to dust

I've got a knife in my hand and a dying dream (Do it)
I will die on my own terms or I will not die at all
You were absent during the climb
And now you've come to watch me fall

I've lived a life of suffering
I seek only peace
I'll die a death of sweet relief
But only if you'll let me

God in Heaven
I need divine intervention
To escape this detention
Can't you divert my attention?
I swear I've got the right intentions
I'm just sick

Oh, yes, I'm sick in the head
And every night when I lay down to sleep
Oh, I wish I was dead

I've got a knife in my hand and a dying dream
I drag the blade vertically
There will be no resuscitating me
