What I would give to wear your skin
Yeah
What I would give to wear your skin

Well, everyone I know has this perfect little life
In their perfect little home with their perfect little wife
No troubles, no struggle
A perfect stranger to pain and strife

When I look in the mirror
I don't recognize the man I see
Oh, how I wish I could be you
And how I wish you were me

The thoughts in my brain
They are laced with unbridled disdain
And I can't remember
The last time I felt this insane

What I would give to wear your skin
Go!
Yeah
What I would give to wear your skin
I wouldn't waste an inch

When I look in the mirror
No, I don't recognize the man I see
Oh, how I wish I could be you
And how I wish you were me

Well, everything I see is just conspiracy
Like this whole godforsaken world is ganging up on me
But I see you, and I want to be you
I'll wear your skin like a suit

I'll wear your skin
And I'll live your life over and over again
Over and over again

When I look in the mirror
I don't recognize the man I see
Oh, how I wish I could be you
And how I wish you were me
Oh, just let me wear your skin
Oh, come on, you gotta let me wear your skin
I want to wear your skin
Why won't you let me wear your skin?
