[This song is dedicated to anyone who has struggled with whether or not to pursue professional help for mental health issues.]

Set it off

I, I, I swear I've seen this all before, it looks so familiar
But I just can't place it in my mind
I, I, I swear I've walked this exact street with these same two feet, but I
I just can't pace it, I don't have time

To every person in the back of the room
Who crosses their arms and thinks they can do what I do
Come walk a mile in my shoes
And maybe then you'll see
It's not as easy as you think it would be

I, I, I think I'm losing my mind
I, I, I think I'm losing my mind
But I tell my doctors I'm feeling just fine, even though
I, I, I think I'm losing my mind

I, I, I swear I've written this line before, it sounds so familiar
But I can't just sing it in my mind
I, I, I've got this raging beast inside just waiting to grab that mic
So I just let go and close my eyes

To all the people in the back of the room
Crossing their arms and scoffing at everything I do
Come walk a mile in my shoes
And maybe then you'll see
It's not as easy as you think it would be

I, I, I think I'm losing my mind
I, I, I think I'm losing my mind
But I tell my doctors I'm feeling just fine, even though
I, I, I think I'm losing my mind

I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost it
