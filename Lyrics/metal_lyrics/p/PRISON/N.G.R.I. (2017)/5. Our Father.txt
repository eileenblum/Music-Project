[This song is dedicated to anyone who has struggled with faith or faced discrimination due to what they believe.]

Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
But it doesn't matter what creed you claim
Because we all bleed the same

I wish your issue with authority
Didn't bleed your well of faith so dry
And I wish your issue with uncertainty
Didn't pull that veil over your eyes

If you believe in right and wrong, then you believe in good and evil
(Break the barrier)
Underneath, we're flesh and bone, just ordinary people
So you can keep your judging stares, all men are created equal

Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
But you keep twisting the scriptures
So human beings are to blame

I wish your issue with authority
Didn't bleed your well of hope so dry
And I wish your issue with uncertainty
Didn't blind your prying eyes

Commanded by the hand of god
To judge the few?
God isn't the problem
It's people like you

Commanded by the hand of god
To judge my views? I doubt it
God isn't the problem
It's people like you

Don't let mankind ruin your faith
