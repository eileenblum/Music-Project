[This song is dedicated to victims of sexual abuse.]

Rape me
You know that I'm too weak to speak my mind
Rape me
You know you want to, I can see your lust eating you alive

My body used to be a temple
Why do you think I'm sober?
Why do you think I'm able to make a choice?

No libido, no desire
You robbed me of my freedom
You robbed me ofâ¦

My body is not your property
No means no

With every kiss you steal
And every touch you sneak
And every lie you spit
You cut me so deep

Rape me
Well, was it something I was wearing at the time?
Rape me
So tell me again how I was begging for it with my eyes

Who died and made you queen?
And what makes you think that you own my body?
Hurt

So blame the victim
You think you'll get away with it
No means no means no

My body used to be a temple
Why do you think I'm sober?
Why do you think I'm able to fight back?

No libido
No desire
You robbed me of my freedom
You robbed me of my fireâ¦ fire

Rape me
If you can sleep at night with this weighing on your conscience
Rape me
If you can live with yourself knowing what you've done

Rape me
Don't let me stop you
Don't let me stand in your way
