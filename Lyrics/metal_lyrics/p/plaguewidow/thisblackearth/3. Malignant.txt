[performed by Plague Widow]Reflect the suffering
To expect control.
Hideous delusions,
Disgust in creation.
Surrender all
Thoughts of ones
Independent
Consciousness.

Now a place of programmed
Implementations.
So empty before this
Life of obsolescence.

Swarming coagulations
Manipulating time
And somatic senses.

A loss of time in
Mnemonic seclusion,
Altering unworldly and
Cognitive dissonance.

Disarmed and destroyed,
Afraid and forgotten,
The withering earth prevails.

Invoking all resting revenge,
Now unleashed from
Malignance.
