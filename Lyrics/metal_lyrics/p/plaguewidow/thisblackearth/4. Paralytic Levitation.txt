[performed by Plague Widow]Forced into the mind, implanted reactions
Directing the body into paralytic levitation
Re-birthed through reanimation
Auto-hypnotic trances of lurid psychosis
Left in a state of complete possession

Chambers of lifeless bodies all specifically grown for this breed of servility
preparing for the fires of the final wars
masses charred, now time to rid the fear to silence

They lay sleeping like the quiet corpse
Waiting for the last age of existence
