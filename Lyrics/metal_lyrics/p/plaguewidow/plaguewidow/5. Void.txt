Servile and programmed
Conducting augmented voids of life,
Paths are forming of ignorant and feeble mind,
Existing beyond the eyes of blinding apathy
Into unseen dimensions
untouched by mortal beings-
Mountains of bodies lost in this barren land,
for this is the moribund

Hallucinating unknown designs of structure,
within the void of human life. [2x]
