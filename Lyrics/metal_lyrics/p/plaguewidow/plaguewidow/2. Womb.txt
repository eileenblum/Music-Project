Incubated genes
manipulated birth
Harvesting the bodies from the womb-
Artificial minds
of artificial purpose
Collecting what is left for rebirth-
Perpetuated life:
We are already dead because of fear, predetermined into something catastrophic,
that will end us all,

We are the prisoners of this wretched plague

Embryonic farms will control and produce the world of slaves,
and we are left with nothing
but fear of innovation,
We are prisoners of the wretched plague.
