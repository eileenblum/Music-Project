Witness the gaping skies
engulf the earth
this land of fire, plagues and extinction
and it is here, where we will conjure
entire lives, forgotten...

[Chorus]

Thrown in the wars of dividing worlds
Immersed in a helpless, tired existence...
falling in sedation
with the essence of obfuscation

Engineering the apparatus
we are left to envision interpretation,
An undeserving reaction, but one of certain inevitability.

[Chorus]
