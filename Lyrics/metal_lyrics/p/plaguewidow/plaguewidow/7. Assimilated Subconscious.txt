Within assimilated subconscious, patterns of the great unscaled influence,
regaining collected and unknown incapabilities,
Strengthening the connections of internal memory into external reality-
Everything controlled, life was never cherished, now we are stained in agony-
the world will fall alongside the weeping children, begging for absolution-
Living as the cyst upon the speaking tongue of primitive aphasia-
Unavoidable perversions companied the last engrained projections.
