Animated perception, Living in antogony
Burn, knowing that life was just as delicate
as your burnt flesh
(Mabus Incarnate)
With everyone gathering, witnessing incarnated life
Outside of death where the divine writhe,
Lies, devoid of ever knowing the truth
Time restarts, life begins again...
Never will we attempt, to rebuild what has fallen out of our hands,
now reduced to a pile
of cremation. [2x]
