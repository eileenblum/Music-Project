Life is floating
Passing me by

Sometimes I try to reach for it;
Sometimes I do not care

Destiny, I was set to cross
I only see the paths walked
Yet, as new images emerge
I look ahead
Playing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde;
One foot in the stream
One in control;
Sometimes I don't care 

Life is floating
Passing me by

Sometimes I try to reach for it;
Sometimes I do not care

Earth, I was placed upon
I see society; and Them

Yet, as I am here anyway
I look around
But as things grow too big or too small
I fall
I find
Sometimes I try to reach for it 

Life is floating
Passing me by

Sometimes I try to reach for it;
Sometimes I do not care
