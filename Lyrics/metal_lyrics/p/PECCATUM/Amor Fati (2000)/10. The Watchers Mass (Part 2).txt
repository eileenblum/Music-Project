The watchers;  Those who fell

They were set to be
The watchers
Their duty was to instruct
The children of men

Some angels came too close
To their task:  mankind
They descended to earth;
Found its daughters to becoming
Thus condemned
And fallen angels they became

Right side was no longer their place
Nor were they placed on the left
half divined by birth
half evil by their sin
They were renamed half-casts

Unlike men their halves did not mingle
But stayed there side by side
Pure -- untouched
Carriers of sorrow

They bred with humans
Thus, their tale never ends
Glowing; pure and cursed
They still chose the earth over again
