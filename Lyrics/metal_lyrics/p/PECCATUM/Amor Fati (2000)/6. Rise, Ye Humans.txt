Maybe one of the reasons why humans
are floating away from humanity
is their misinterpreted crusade of working
for themselves opposed to working
and searching within themselves.

The past
The judge
Oh, ye humans
Grieve, grieve
For your lost humanity

Oh, ye humans with your shallow talk
and pointed fingers continue to sleep
with your enemies and sink even deeper
into hypocrisy until you crawl away
into a new day where no species
are to be called human beings.

The past
The judge
Oh, my fellow species
Search, search
For your lost humanity

Search
Crawl humans
Rise
