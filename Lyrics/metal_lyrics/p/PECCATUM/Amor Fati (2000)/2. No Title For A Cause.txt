As I am chained to Earth
I float on a leash
As I am chained to myself
I drift in solitude
Far off and close are my next
Like them I walk alone

One dimension; or many?
Is my dream alive
Or life a dream
Oh, I envy your answers

One truth; or many?  If any

Are all leashes as tight as mine
Or am I just a rebel?
Where is then my fight?
Release my powers of solitude
Keep them as a shield
Unlike society I drift alone

One truth; or many?  If any
