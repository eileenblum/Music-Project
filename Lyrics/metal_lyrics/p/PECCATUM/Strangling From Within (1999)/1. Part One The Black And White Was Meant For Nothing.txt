THE SHADOWS MEANT FOR ALL

Where do I then belong?

Hail Thee; my brother;
My angel of nothing and all
Why did you welcome your own kin;
Spawn of the ultimate sin
If not with you; where do I then belong?

And even the kingdom of death
Rejected my existence
As a human being
Neither was I to be welcomed
Among Gods nor Angels

I am walking around
In life itself
But as my eyes meet reality
All I can see is death mingled
With misery; And I still walk

Reveal your care
Hear my final prayer;
My darkest call
Confirm to me and for all
Where do I then belong?

The feet of mine
Can no longer walk towards Thine
So my dearest brother; I beg you
To walk, at last, my steps for me
And guide me back to Thee
