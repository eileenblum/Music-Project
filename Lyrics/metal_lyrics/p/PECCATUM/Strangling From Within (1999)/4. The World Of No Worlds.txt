When I opened my eyes
I could again device
The way I saw when I was;
But I was not yet born
The time of my arise
Was the sunset
And as men was thrown at me
The eclipse became the eye of mine

The eclipse of men caught me
Inside a human pestered earth
Father earth; Holy mother;
Save me from the land of loneliness
And return to me the divined
Gift of solitude

And as men was thrown at me
The eclipse became the eye of mine
I was not able to see the dark
Because of the darkness
While chaos of emptiness
Tormented the voices of silence
And as I fought the voices of time
A crow finally
Revealed before me

A crow finally
Revealed before me
Yet as my eyes fought back the dark
The darkness came to me
The home of men exploded;
The sun fell
And the shadow of Thee
Finally embraced me
The world of no worlds
Was again mine to be
