Corrupted desolation 
the sound of glass between teeth 
I belch the suicide of guilt 
naked body on display 
parasite my heart 
and the immensity wherein it dies 
immense desolation I cry 
and spit my perception at the world 
amused by the disgust 
or by chance to see it move 
I belch the world I laugh.
