Sickening, sickening place 
framed snapshots of buzzing stillness 
noisy polaroid faces 
with tick, tack clock voices 
with crawling on my skin words 
to drown outside 
my feverish head 
away away away 
to go under in 
a silent sea of nothing 
gone gone gone 
paranoid, paranoid wish 
all feed the claustrophobic storm 
broken down in molecule faces 
with tick, tack clock presence 
with crawling on my heart eyes
to drown outside 
my feverish head 
away away away 
to go under in 
a silent sea of nothing 
gone gone gone 
as a delirious Don Quixote 
I enter the shadow 
of spinning windmills 
ghostly spin, away but not towards 
earthly ride, away but not towards.
