Lights underneath 
from lights above 
trial by water after all 
two by the ocean 
waves crashing in 
a witness of the deep 
the swimmer can swim 
a thousand lengths 
clockwise and reverse 
I cannot swim in you 
absorbed in itself 
all the way down 
to the ever hushed cry
the threat of its stillness 
mirror the sky 
one, two, me and you 
the swimmer can swim 
a thousand lengths 
clockwise and reverse 
I cannot swim in you.
