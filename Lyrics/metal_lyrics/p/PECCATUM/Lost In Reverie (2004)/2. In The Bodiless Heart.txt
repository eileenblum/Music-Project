In the bodiless heart 
headlights in the drowning view 
of splintered night 
invisible moves 
soaked concrete heads 
through floating glass 
like a Gabriel outside 
his heavenly curtain 
he cannot see where the lights 
END 
where he 
ENDS 
or if they know where they 
END 
in the bodiless heart 
headlights in the drowning view 
of splintered night.
