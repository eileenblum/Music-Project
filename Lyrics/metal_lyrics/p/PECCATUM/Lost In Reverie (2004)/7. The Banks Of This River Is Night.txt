Running wide 
on promises of sweet tomorrows 
running deep 
in ignorance and hope 
on and on 
towards the big black sea 
the banks of this river is night 
night is within me 
and I am here in your arms 
drawn in 
by this massive flow of violence 
drawn down 
in this procession of mud 
on and on 
towards the big black sea 
the banks of this river is night
look at her 
when she passes you by 
feel him 
as he denies you again 
on and on 
towards the big black sea 
the banks of this river is night 
night is within me 
and I am here in your arms.
