All is sad, deliciously sad 
and the world affixes itself 
to the sorrow 
quietly, the old woman's kiss 
brought to mortal lips 
swept away swept away 
the kiss 
swept away swept away 

swift chill of desolation 
and the sadness affixes itself 
to decay 

anxiety, the undone 
brought to mortal hearts 
swept away swept away 
her touch 
swept away swept away 

All is cold, deliciously cold 
and the world affixes itself 
to the silence.
