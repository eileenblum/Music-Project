Where beggars take cheques and children steal credit cards
from the pockets of wrecks that lie the road.
I came to in my future and that was just yesterday,
unsure of my past that's a knot in my gut.

You buy me a drink then you think that you've got the right
to crawl in my head and rifle my soul.
You tell me I'm free then you want me to compromise
to sell out my dreams you say you'll make it worthwhile.

Oh, boys would you drink to me now
here on the hill, half way up, half way down
Oh, boys would you drink to me now
here on the hill, half way up, half way down

You tell me I'm drunk then you stand back and smug a while
convinced that you're right that you're still in command of your senses.
I laugh at your superior attitude
your insincere platitudes make me throw up.

The sooner you realize I'm perfectly happy
if I'm left to decide the company I choose.

Oh, boys would you drink to me now
here on the hill, half way up, half way down
Oh for the company born to the company
live for the company until I die.

The sooner you realize I'm perfectly happy
if I'm left to decide the company I choose
The company I choose is solidly singular
totally trustworthy, straight and sincere
polished, experienced, witty and charming
so why don't you push off, this company's my own.

Oh, boys will you drink to me now
here on the hill, half way up, half way down
Oh, boys will you drink to me now
here on the hill, half way up, half way down
Oh for the company, dream of the company
live for the company until I die.
Oh for the company, dream of the company
drink to the company until we die
until we die
until we die.
