... And love remains a constant river
May sadness flee from stars delivered
The sunwheel burns in ancient grace
On marble stairs the soulspawn race...

Take this old rose and go to the stones
Where a twin-flower grows without love
I know of your leave you've spread on the ground
Let my sunbrother weave a flamedove

Shimmering nightfalls contain lunar blood
My halls are so barren and empty
I kneel on our hill while sunshine awakes
But no one to share the grandeur with me

Oh dear, oh dear
Wail morningtear
Oh dear, my dear
Moonqueen waits here

The presence of autumn allows me to dream
About silver-pearled breasts obscene
Imagine a goddess unbound to spacetime
Would you taste the crestfallen wine

Look into thy springlit mirror
Do you see thine goldforged eyes
Save my orbit kiss ye wounds
Fairyland or flaming scythe
Summer's melting heart shines blue
Deepblue like a secret flower
Away, away with all thine sorrow
Labyrinth or cosmic tower

Diamond nails and autumnswords
Rainspeared symbols loose their tongues
Is there one beyond the line
Who tells me where my soul belongs
Bow to winter's crystal ocean
Count thy stars thine firmament
Arrows run through undressed visions
Godwinged bird or restless end

On marble stairs we float and dance without rings
Our wedding is eternal we don't need mortal strings
Love me like I love you and feed my starving flame
A serenade in minor could fill the empty frame

Oh dear, oh dear
Wail morningtear
Oh dear, my dear
Moonqueen waits here
