Once upon a time there was a queen without a royal smile
She used to watch the crimson stage when sun and sea
collided

One night the spirits entered the chamber
And winter's talons escaped from existence
Through wormholes we are yet our task is to be
We slip into pictures, spiritlands, astral trees

Cheerful she balanced on heavendressed shorelines
Her virtues reached out for the center unlogic

Moonrose ennobled by thorns
Horizon's eclipse will flow into dawn

I burn down ye stronghold
And I burn down ye kin
Kneel down to thy scythe
Praise my soulhorde of sin

Sorrowed breath we are
Midnight mood soulstar

Moonrose ennobled by thorns
Horizon's eclipse will flow into dawn

I burn down ye stronghold
And I burn down ye kin
Kneel down to thy scythe
Praise my soulhorde of sin

On melting flames we drift above your sombre aura
Our nights still dance where Lord Sun never falls

Disown me bright angel, I spit onto you
Ephemeral lights won't paint my sky blue

Oh princess come and yearn for me
I save your tragic smile
We rise together hand in hand
To starlit mountainsides

You flee, you flee, Lord Tragedy
Perfection, chaos, end
I procreate thy wicked seed
Our Satan hails thy damned

Moonrose ennobled by thorns
Horizon's eclipse will flow into dawn
I burn down ye stronghold
And I burn down ye kin
Kneel down to thy scythe
Praise my soulhorde of sin

We are gods...
Undying ornaments in an everlasting cycle...
Painting the frame for the nightfall orchestration,
As the sun yields her stage to the moonqueen
