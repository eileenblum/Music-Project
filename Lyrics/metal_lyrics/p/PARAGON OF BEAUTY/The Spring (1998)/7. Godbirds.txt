A godbird bears the wisdom of a million striving lilies

Diamond coloured angel yearning to fly because we are
godbirds

Wail thou dancer, wail thou child
Thy godbirds leave their castle, dark frozen autumnside
Your flaming dress, your charming smile
I would flee from Eden's safety, a blind man for a while

Why do you search for the graveyard in me
As moongold awakes on my cheek
Grey meadows in June like sheltering hands
That bleed in the wombs of thy weak

She married my knowledge, crimson shorelines to sort
With her steed named loverebellion riding sunblessed fiords
Astral fires burning distant galaxies
We hunt to feed our wisdom, perpetual odyssey

Hail thou dancer, hail thou child
Thy godbirds join their kingdom, bright velvet autumnside
I love you robe, I love your smile
Could I flee from Eden's safety to kiss you with a sigh?

Why do you search for the graveyard in me
As moongold awakes on my cheek
Grey meadows in June like sheltering hands
That bleed in the wombs of thy weak

Why do you search for the graveyard in me...
