I have this vision true and wise
Of a winter's gravedance dawning twice
Painful life, joyful death
I hail you under the spiritual flag
Of the sunthorncosmos

My heartbeam was wingless and the skygreens were grey
Hark, I starved of a cosmos at my soulbirth in May

I emerged from the stones with a flamebunch of mirth
A weight that is more than a lifetime on earth

Chaoswoven threads and miracles of soulspawn pain
A sparkling shade amidst the purple edenflame

A black woeful raven crossed the sunconquered plain
Starved of love and withered with an ode to the rain

Unravel thy secret thou keeper unseen
And write down your rune in emerald green

Chaoswoven threads and miracles of soulspawn pain
A sparkling shade amidst the dying edenflame

Seeds unbroken and wings sailing free
December birds have churned up the sea

Newborn dreams, oh please cherish the night
The winter dies with a promise, moonchild

Chaoswoven threads and miracles of soulspawn pain
A sparkling shade amidst the purple edenflame
