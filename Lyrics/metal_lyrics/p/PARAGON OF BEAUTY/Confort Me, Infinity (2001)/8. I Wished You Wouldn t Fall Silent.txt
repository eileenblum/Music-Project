My lips are dry like summer air
I cannot move. I cannot bear
The things you've never blown away
I look at you but don't sway

Remember how amazed you were
When lilies white budd new and rare
When all the sketches of your past
Were freak tales unattached and vast

Something is left within - I know
Something is left - anywhere

You glide towards sardonic roads
Impossible to steer your boat
A leaf that swirls in dizzy height
Is easier to catch than pride

You think that everything goes well
But deep inside sensations yell
You never heard this cruel sound
Cause otherwise you'd spinning round

Something is left within - I know
Something is left - anywhere

I wished you were the same
A dancer in the rain
"My childhood is over", - you say
