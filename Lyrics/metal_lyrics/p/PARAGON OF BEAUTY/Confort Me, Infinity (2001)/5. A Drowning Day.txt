I listened to the endless grey
Nowhere, nowhere I stay
I am too weak, I cannot cry
So cold inside my heart

I leave this world today
You will not save me
The lights are glowing dim
No more rain

I'm running through a
dripping cloud
Why can't you feel the same?

You are so far away
I fear those sad nights
And every day is bleak
Hold me back

There are no colours here inside
Sometimes I wonder why
You don't leave

No more rain
Why does it rain?
