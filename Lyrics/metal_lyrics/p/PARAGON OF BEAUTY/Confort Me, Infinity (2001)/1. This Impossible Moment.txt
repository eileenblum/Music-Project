Sometimes I am infinite
Sometimes I am dead tired
You have seen me there
On the ground, without heartbeat

Weird they are, the frail colours
Of this impossible moment

I hoped the wind would glean colder
I have searched for reasons to live
You have seen me here by your side
A fragile night

Weird they are, the frail colours
Of this impossible moment
Countless thoughts have rushed
through my cruel mind
Who was there - inside the end?

The end, the end, the end...
