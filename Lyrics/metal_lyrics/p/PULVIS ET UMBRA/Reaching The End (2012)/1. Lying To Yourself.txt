Every time I ask You
if there's something which is going wrong
and You answer me that everything's OK
You know that's not true, 'cause You're lying to Yourself

Every time I see You
feeling so strange
but You tell me you're OK
You know that You're lying to yourself

[CHORUS:]
Don't play with trust
respect is not a game
beware from lies
they took Ya in the darkside

Always told me that I'm Your best friend
so tell me what went wrong
I'd like to know, I'd like to help You
at the contrary I can't trust You anymore

If You don't speak to me
I can't give You my advises
If You made the wrong choice (tell me)
what should I think of you, man?

[CHORUS:]
Don't play with trust
respect is not a game
beware from lies
they took Ya in the darkside

Time to put it away
so put Your mask away from You
You can live with anymore
You'll be rotten to the core
