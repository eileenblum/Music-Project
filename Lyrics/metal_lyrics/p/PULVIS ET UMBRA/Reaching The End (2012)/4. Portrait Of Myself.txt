I'm driving alone
on this empty road
where the sun wont shines
and birds refuse to fly
Don't know where I'm heading
(I've got no one to reach)
There's no one left behind
(all it seems black as pitch)

Drawing new lines
adding new colors
Trying to replace my pride with honor
Painting new skies
(I've got nobody's help)
I've got nobody's help
(wanna escape from this hell)

Think about I am right
as well as I'm wrong
I can feel myself wonder
as well as indifferent
Suffocated by memories
trying to be strong
Drowning in doubts
and no one hears my call

Drawing new lines
adding new colors
Trying to replace my pride with honor
Painting new skies
(I've got nobody's help)
Blinding my eyes
(tired to bring hell inside)

[CHORUS]
I'm trying it hard, I'm trying it hard so many times
pain and sorrow are not easy to forgive
Remorses appears me as crimes
things drive me mad, I cannot reach the light

Darkness surround my mind
shadows push me from side to side
Afraid by myself, loosing my way
is that the price I have to pay?

I showed You my weakness
anxious wait behind my heart
It brings anguish and fear
this is my portrait, yes this is my portrait
this is my portrait, the portrait of myself

[CHORUS]
I'm trying it hard, I'm trying it hard so many times
pain and sorrow are not easy to forgive
Remorses appears me as crimes
things drive me mad, I cannot reach the light
