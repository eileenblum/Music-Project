We're breathing every day
lies and arrogance
Refuse what stays outside
we close ourselves in our dreams and fly

It's seems a turning circle
that never leave this place
We're trying to change the course of things
we're trying to make them better

Afraid by those who follow
people live in fear and apathy
They are not stupid
they're acting as to be

It's seems a turning circle
that never leave this place
We tried to change the course of things
we tried to make them better

[CHORUS:]
Consider us like fools
they're pushing man vs. man
Think there's nothing to believe in
depriving humans of their feelings
Black and white are on the screen
what we can put in between?

Society try to stop us
society try to put us back
Everywhere we turn
our hopes are going to burn

Foolish reigning on the sphere
violence hits us everywhere
Controlling each existences
destroying all resistances

Words are written on the wall
men of power will take control
We're facing the battle
some stand and some will fall

[CHORUS:]
Consider us like fools
they're pushing man vs. man
Think there's nothing to believe in
depriving humans of their feelings
Black and white are on the screen
what we can put in between?

Last days are getting closers
everyone feels own self alone
Peace and hope, the real losers
everything has now be done

The sky is turning black
evil won't let us go
There is no turning back
everything has now be done

Mankind reaches its end
each man killed own self
There's nothing more to believe in
chooses easy the way of surrendering
Blood is covering the screen
red will paint us til the end of time
