It lives in all of us
from ancient times
No money could buy it
I'm sorry it has no price
no force could ram it down
it will rise stronger
stronger than you can imagine
stronger than we can imagine
it stands ...

( P - R - I - C- E . . . . . .  T - R - U - S - T )

Don't try to hide it
cause you'll show your weakness
Don't try to change it
cause you'll show your weakness
it's your weakness

Don't need to hide it anymore
your purity is strong
Don't need to change it anymore
your purity is strong

Be honest with yourself
be honest with your friends
Ask for it it's easy
but you must deserve
There's one way to be chosen
remarking truth with trust
This is the only price
this is the price of trust

( P - R - I - C- E . . . . . .  T - R - U - S - T )

Don't try to hide it
cause you'll show your weakness
Don't try to change it
cause you'll show your weakness
it's your weakness

There's one way to be chosen
remarking truth with trust
This is the only price
this is the price of trust
