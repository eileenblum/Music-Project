We live in a world where everything goes to rack and ruin day by day
and where at the same time seems that nobody notice it
War and racism are two words that we still not be able to erase.
Politics criticized each other publicizing themselves in turn.
While some people die in the street if they are not able to sell drugs,
young mothers kill they children and kill themselves soon
afterwards as if it is like a style
If it's a life,I found it repulsive

Nature destroyed houses and families of many people
Boys and girls are sentenced by their dress
and other people who has nothing to do sow terror on the streets
If it's a life, I found it repulsive

I don't know if my these words will change something
but down here life is hardest and hardest
The only thing to do for everybody who keep my same thing
is to hope in a better afterlife

One day we will call in front of Him
And each one of us must pay, included all of they
who think are able to judge their convicts in this world.
I hope (for me) that day will be so far.

I don't know if my these words will change something
but down here life is hardest and hardest
The only thing to do for everybody who keep my same thing
is to hope in a better afterlife

I address this last pray to you:
"Don't let me be the last to bring the flowers...
I will not able to endure this pain. Thanks!"
