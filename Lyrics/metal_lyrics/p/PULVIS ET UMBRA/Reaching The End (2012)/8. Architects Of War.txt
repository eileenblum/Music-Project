Architects of war
bringers of pain
Erasers of life
nothing remain

There will be no winner
there will be no looser
Those people are fools
'cause they fight as they're tools

[CHORUS]
Who brings all this violence
who brings here the death
Listen to our conscience
and fight all of this back

Thinking to be right
insanity is their guide
It's a never-ending fight
no conscience from their side

Building are burnings
people are dying
It will be a turning circle
no sense, only pride

[CHORUS]
Who brings there all this violence
destroyed what we sinked
Who brings there the death
destroyed his life too

Who brings there all this violence
someone with no conscience
We 'll never stop dreaming
our future is clear, our future is near

Look at what You done, do you feel ya satisfied?
Time to pay for Your mistakes
Prison or death is not enough for You
We bring You suffer for each day of Your life

Yeah, that is what we'll make
Yeah, that is what we'll make
Yeah, that is what we'll make
