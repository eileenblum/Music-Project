Cannot realize what I'm feeling
no answers to my question
All around has no more meaning
void is hurting me inside
It's time to end it up (free your mind)
it's time to fill it up (free you heart)
I'm taking back myself
and no one can stop me

[Chorus]
Ocean without water
veins without blood
That's what I'm feeling
I can't fight this no more
if no one hears my call

Million words cover the walls
like sign which comes from above
They're written with no ink
who can help me then to read?
Close my eyes &amp; wonder why
flying away to understand
It's not simply imagination
it's my idea of recreation

[Bridge]
Emptiness as loneliness
push oneself to the agony
Trying to make you weak
wants to make you weak

[Chorus]
Ocean without water
veins without blood
That's what I'm feeling
I can't fight this no more
if no one hears my call

Sky deprived of clouds
sun deprived by own light
That's what I'm feeling
'til someone hear my call

Final
Game build up by madness
trying to make you weak
wants to make you weak
