... bottomless drift ...

Souls Of Our Beloved
Left our bodies
Changing own identity
til they'll disappear
Hands are writing memories
on empty pages
Hitting our hearts once again
we're blaming those images

Sitting on the edge of a dream
afraid of what we left behind
don't wanna open that door
Afraid of those dead eyes

Don't wanna hear anymore
afraid of those unspoken words
Don't wanna hear anymore
afraid of those unspoken words

Suburb of a fallen city

knowing herself as a symphony
Music is playing inside her
no instruments recognized
She felt as deprived of her dreams

Black maelstrom
vertigo falling into void
unboard ocean where memories float
faces, books, palaces .. echoes
captured in a bottomless drift

she felt as been deprive
she felt as been deprive
she felt as been deprive
of her dreams...
