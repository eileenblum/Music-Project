When all seems dead and gone
and all your tears has been cry out
When all your hurts seems bleed away
empty status, no reason to shout
When pain or smile don't hit you anymore
lost in a limbo being not be able to escape from
When everything seems lost mean and sense
you lost what once has been name "innocence"

[Bridge]
It's time to ...

[Chorus]
Look through the eyes
press the trigger, hope to reborn outside these lies
No reasons why
should keep something about own life

Living an eternal question
time's getting longer and irrelevant
Thinking about given my best of
losing any concept of trust
Wearing skins like a mask
weakness let me awaiting
The real me lost his own task
no more giving no more sharing

[Bridge]
It's time to realize....
Can't figure out but it's to face it
It's time to realize
It's time to ...

[Chorus 2x]
Look through the eyes
press the trigger, hope to reborn outside these lies
No reasons why
should keep something about own life
