Sick of being abused by this sickness
which haunting me like a ghost

Circle of neverending moods
close to me like a shadow
Fluctuation of sorrow / happiness
mindfield full of enemies

Trigger is not the solution
battle will be avoid
Still caught in this limbo
heart is exploited

[Chorus]
Converge them in a place
where all can be finally faced
serenity will begun

Uncovered memories wait
as sinners loosing their faith
They're act as parasites
they work days and nights
Co-exist with my demons
hope dies as a concept of freedom

Tears, screams and blood
increase without senses

Set to forget and not to forgive
follow this chosen path
Set to forget and not to forgive
follow this chosen path

What about aftermaths???

Time will tell...

Implosion of pain
