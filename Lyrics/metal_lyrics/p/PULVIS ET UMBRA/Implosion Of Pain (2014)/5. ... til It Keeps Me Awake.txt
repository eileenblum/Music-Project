Unknown sensation
roughest than a usually hurt,
nearest to a broken heart
Cannot describe it to You
I feel them on all of my sides
both inside and outside

Temporary suffering reaches mind and body
Serenity broken by screams of agony
Who's the bringer, who's the blame
I'm searching escape from this pain
they drive me mad, I'm reaching insanity
please bring me away, bring me away

[Chorus]
And when I'm going to sleep
I close my eyes, turn off my mind
My dreams I' can't succeed to take
'cause pain keeps me awake

As a finger push itself on a button coloured green
I feel this torture over and under my skin

Results of this simply but deep impact
are the feelings which work in me

[Bridge]
No antidotes ...

[Solo - Damy]
