Resounding in my ears
Ticking in my brain
Lullaby
I close my eyes, fall asleep
feels like someone's stealing my dreams
Lullaby
Walls are closing in
locked windows, melting floor
Claustrophobia appears once more

Run away
give me the key
Run away
give me that key

Unlock the door, facing the unknown
my body sweats as tied in own bed
Open the door, jump to the unknown
this is not what I dreamed for

Wake me up
stop singing
Wake me up
I am the victim

[Bridge]
Evil creatures born from Your notes
Evil creatures born from Your words
Lullaby

Wake me up
hold my hand
Wake me up
Shut Yourself !!!
