Humanity always challenged itself in huge goals
one of which may emerge is the conquer of space
American was sure to win against Russia
on the race to the Moon

July 20 of 1969
American Neil Armstrong wrote a page in the story
as the first man who walked on another heavenly body.

[Bridge]
Everything which follow in the future was consider
by many people like a âdaily routineâ,
but the years and the unforseens established the contrary.

[Chorus]
Someone should lost the Moon [2x]

NASA was facing the frightful battle of those years,
save three men, the crew of APOLLO 13,
from the unknown âworldâ of space.
Day and night people talk over, improvised, simulated, prayed
while press established its bastards
Lending interest only when they hear about the âTragedyâ

[Chorus]
They've lost the Moonâ¦ [2x]

[2nd Solo - Alessandro Tuvo]

A dark, painful and monotonous view flowed below they
the unbreathblity of the air was caused by the saturation of filters.
The parachutes and the termical shield
could be damaged.

Entering the atmosphere
endless radio silence âtilâ¦.

Theyâve lost the Moon [3x]â¦
But they survived
