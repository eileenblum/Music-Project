When you get home I will be there waiting for you
With a poisoned drink in my hand,
Because two can play at this game
This world's not big enough for the two of us
Although, you're still the most beautiful hooker alive

Look who's smiling now
Remember when you said,
"What's the worst thing that could happen?"
Well it's happening to you,
Yeah, right fucking now
To a soundtrack inside my head
And the record keeps on skippin',
Playin' the same part
Over and over and over again!

Satellites spin in empty galaxies
As the comets penetrate the space
Good nights fade into bad days
As the sun set into blue nightmares

Bleeding out the apathy,
Sleeping with the enemy
You are now my only desire
I don't know whether to kiss you, or cut you, and kill you

I couldn't cry if I wanted to,
I wasn't good enough for you
You are unhealthy for anyone
The skin and the muscle, the worms

Look who's smiling now
Remember when you said,
"What's the worst thing that could happen?"
Well it's happening to you,
Yeah, right fucking now
To a soundtrack inside my head
And the record keeps on skippin',
Playin' the same part
Over and over and over again!

What's the worst thing that could happen?
It's happening to you, right fucking now
Look who's smiling now
I remember you and I parked on Lover's Lane,
Drinking each others' blood,
So young and insane
When you bit your lip, and you winked at me,
With a promise we would be
Together forever
Let's stop pretending,
This love is neverending
But all good things,
Must someday come to die

One more disco!
One, one more disco!

Look who's smiling now
Remember when you said,
"What's the worst thing that could happen?"
Well it's happening to you,
Yeah, right fucking now
To a soundtrack inside my head
And the record keeps on skippin',
Playin' the same part
Over and over and over again!
