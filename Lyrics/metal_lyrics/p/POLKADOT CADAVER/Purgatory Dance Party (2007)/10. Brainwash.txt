Oooh ahh, oooh ahh, oooh ahh, oooh oooh
Oooh ahh, oooh ahh, oooh ahh, oooh oooh

Your fragile eyes brainwash the weak,
Remaining silent so to speak
Your dizzy head and weakened bones
Play funeral dirges in skeletons

Brainwash my head
To clear away all the lies that I've been forced and fed
What could have been?
What could it be,
That you saw inside of me
That you would ever give me your love?

I believe the fact God worships you,
Is going straight to your head
I'm dying to feed on your disease
(And I swore I heard you sing)
"Drive through to the next window, please"
(Drive through, now)

Brainwash my head
To clear away
All the lies
That I've been forced and fed
What could have been?
What could it be,
That you saw inside of me
That you would ever give me your love?

(Brainwash)

All these days fade into gray,
As this dying love decays
Inside this cold lobotomy
(No brain activity)
I'll turn to stone if I look away
(I can't look away)
The sun won't shine a single ray
(As we eclipse the apocalypse)

I've got news for you now, sugar,
You're a real fucking heartbreaker
But before I lay down and die,
Oh, I've got a big surprise
So come and hold out your hand and close your eyes real tight,
There will be no forgetting tonight
This is a memento of my demise,
Take my heart here wrapped in velvet,
I don't need it anymore!
Talk is cheap but I know you're listening,
I don't want to feel anymore!
Sinking like a pirate on a seagrave ship of fools
You know I'm a fool for you, a fool for you, a fool for you

Oooh ahh, oooh ahh, oooh ahh, oooh oooh

Brainwash my head
To clear away
All the lies
That I've been forced and fed
What could have been?
What could it be,
That you saw inside of me
That you would ever give me your love?

(Everybody sing it now)

All these days fade into gray,
As this dying love decays
Inside this cold lobotomy
(No brain activity)
I'll turn to stone if I look away
(I can't look away)
The sun won't shine a single ray
(As we eclipse the apocalypse)
