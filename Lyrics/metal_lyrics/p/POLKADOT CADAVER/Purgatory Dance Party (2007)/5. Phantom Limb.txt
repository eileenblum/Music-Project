I don't know how,
I don't know how, but they've found me
It's only a matter of time,
Before I'm hanging by a light post in the center of town
Along with my family

We'll drink to the dead now, just ghosts in the war fields
Eat bread as the body of a god make believe
These sticks and these stones will break hearts and split bones
Peace of mind only comes when you realize...

You can't chase away all your demons now
With withered and broken legs...
As your crippled sanity
Swings like a pendulum,
Hanging like a phantom limb

I don't know why,
I don't know why you ever loved me,
Such a low, down right, pitiful fool
Look at you now,
Hanging by a thread
Under a full moon

We'll drink to the dead as we gulp down the blood
We'll chase it with whiskey and swallow the floods
That wash away souls of which I can't forgive
That hover like a phantom limb

You can't chase away all your demons now
With withered and broken legs...
As your crippled sanity
Swings like a pendulum,
Hanging like a phantom limb

Phantom hovering silently,
hanging like the guilty
[x2]
Phantom hovering silently

Dizzy vultures in my head,
Slowly circling the dead
Nauseating nursery rhymes

You can't chase away all your demons now
With withered and broken legs...
As your crippled sanity
Swings like a pendulum,
Hanging like a phantom limb
