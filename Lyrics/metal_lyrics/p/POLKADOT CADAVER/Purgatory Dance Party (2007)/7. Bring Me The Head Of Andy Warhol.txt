This is beginning to feel just like a competition
I see you smilin' at me and your front teeth are missin'
Snapshots and flash bulbs ignite along the runway
And you freeze like a pale mannequin,
I think you like what you see

The plastic surgeons all whispered to each other and blushed
Malevolence breeds contempt into a deviant crush
Mortals threaten suicide until they forget your name
Fifteen minutes of fame is now the name of the game

Post mortem penetration,
Rigamortis sets the scene
Now get under the microscope,
All writhe and squirm in Vaseline
In a city full of rats,
all feeding on the narcissism
I lit the match,
I lit the fire that burned your Hollywood to the ground
(Burn it all down)

IV drippin' like cocaine down the back of your throat
Drama queen all dressed up with nowhere to go
Street walkin', night stalkin', cold-blooded killer
There's a murder in the room of your polkadot cadaver

Bring me the head of Andy Warhol
Bring me the head of Andy Warhol
Nightmares shapeshift into oblivion
You have not even seen the last of me
What do you want me to say?
I wouldn't have it any other way
One day they'll find you with a candle burning inside of you skull

Are you happy now?
You're finally the talk of the town
Search lights in the sky
Your fame will turn this blood into wine

Fashionistas deliver the death blow,
Penetrate you like it's your birthday
Playtime for children in the graveyard
You have not even seen the last of me
What do you want me to say?
I wouldn't have it any other way
One day they'll find you with a candle burning inside of you skull

Cold, pale Jesus,
Sodom and Gomorrah
Headless Horseman,
Death is at your doorstep
The best rehabs are
All in California
Junkies pushing up
Daisies in the garden
Can you dig it?

I've come here to eat your heart out,
Slit your throat,
And fuck your brains out
Keep your voice down or you'll wake them

(So we're starting to get somewhere)

If LSD was was popular as cocaine,
I wouldn't drive a Delorean

Cold, pale Jesus,
Sodom and Gomorrah
Headless Horseman,
Death is at your doorstep
The best rehabs are
All in California
Junkies pushing up
Daisies in the garden

Fashionistas deliver the final death blow,
Penetrate you like it's your birthday
Playtime for children in the graveyard
You have not even seen the last of me
What do you want me to say?
I wouldn't have it any other way
One day they'll find you with a candle burning inside of you skull
