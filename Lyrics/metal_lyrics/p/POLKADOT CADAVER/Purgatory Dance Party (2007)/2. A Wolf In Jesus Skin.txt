Do you remember on the day
We took you down off of the cross
And shot your ashes into space?
Oh what a waste of time to believe,
You would ever come back to life

The resurrections were all faked,
As the earth trembled and quaked
And all the stars fell from the sky
As all the Pagans began to smile
And sigh...

You remind me of a wolf in Jesus skin
I think it's safe to say the drugs are kicking in
As you begin to howl under the Baltimore moon
As you begin to shape shift into a Christ-like cartoon

Come sink your teeth deep inside
This wet and elegant bride
Give her the time of her life
Then turn and leave her to die
The devil is so en vogue [x4]

Well I remember
When all the idiots and whores,
They stood tall like matadors
On the eve of the conviction
In a gruesome crucifixion
And through the hourglass of time
Hollow futures will unwind
Into the ghosts that haunt the past
But it never seems to last

I see you standing there,
Your hands running through your hair
Bleeding on the countryside
Underneath the bright red sky

It's warm inside your broken heart
I know that I never want to leave
The sweetest sting of pains unlike anything I've ever felt before
Seconds before the gunshot blasts ignites straight into your head
Save the last dance for your dying bride
Until the horsemen drag you away

Come sink your teeth deep inside
This wet and elegant bride
Give her the time of her life
Then turn and leave her to die
The devil is so en vogue [x4]

You remind me of a wolf in Jesus skin
I think it's safe to say the drugs are kicking in
As you begin to howl under a Baltimore moon
As you begin to shape shift into a Christ-like cartoon
