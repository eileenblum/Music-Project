She likes to cut herself
Until she doesn't recognize
Her face in the mirror
She's walking evidence
At the scene of the crime
She's the hollow and belligerent witness

You belong right here, baby,
Sitting in the electric chair
We'll flip the switches that take you to your burning home:
A haunted castle of Brimstone

Heartbreak in the whites of your eyes,
You pupils bleeding as you cry
Sirens scream at the moonlight
Because the wolf is on the loose tonight

You belong right here, baby,
Sitting in the electric chair
We'll flip the switches that take you to your burning home:
A haunted castle of Brimstone
I know you've got a death wish, honey,
Protruding like a broken bone
Shot from a cannon, gliding on the dance floor,
Smelling of menthols and Coppertone

Everyone's trying to live forever
But you've got your own agenda,
That's what I like about you
You might not be here tomorrow

Through the champagne glass your face looks just like a violent mime
Behind the prison bars your last meal is a bitter pill
One foot in the grave and your head inside the lion's mouth
Time keeps on tickin', they keep on laughing at you, laughing at you
But you know exactly what you want
And now you're gonna get it!
A pistol whip off a loaded gun
You arrived like a bullet in a drive-by

Everyone's trying to live forever
But you've got your own agenda,
That's what I like about you
You might not be here tomorrow

You belong right here, baby,
Sitting in the electric chair
We'll flip the switches that take you to your burning home:
A haunted castle of Brimstone
I know you've got a death wish, honey,
Protruding like a broken bone
Shot from a cannon, gliding on the dance floor,
Smelling of menthols and Coppertone
