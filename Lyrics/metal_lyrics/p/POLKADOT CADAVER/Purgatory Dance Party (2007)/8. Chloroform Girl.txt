Your eyes look just like bullet holes,
It must be all that cryin'
You haven't learned a thing at all

Another Helter Skelter,
Moonlight has come and gone
The bloody writing's on the wall

Chloroform Girl, how have you been?
Don't let me catch you sleepin' again,
You're only alive because I like you
It's been three years since you've seen the sunlight,
But I know you're having fun,
Bound, gagged, and chained up in my basement

You look just like a zombie,
Inches from dead and pretty,
With purple flowers in your hair

I hear the angels crying,
Just as the Devil smiles
All little pigs will die tonight

Chloroform Girl, how have you been?
Don't let me catch you sleepin' again,
You're only alive because I like you
It's been three years since you've seen the sunlight,
But I know you're having fun,
Bound, gagged, and chained up in my basement

I hear the Devil singin' the most haunting melodies
I've got this overwhelming feeling of morbid ecstasy,
Coming over me...

Chloroform Girl, how have you been?
Don't let me catch you sleepin' again,
You're only alive because I like you
It's been three years since you've seen the sunlight,
But I know you're having fun,
Bound, gagged, and chained up in my basement

Chloroform Girl...
