Sole survivor, the guilt is setting in
The plane came crashing down,
I'm the only one who lived
A turbulent flight led you to this place and time,
A one-way ticket to the end of your life

Black and blue angels who float through the aisleways
Smile at children who don't hear a word they say
Fasten your seat belts, you're in for a bumpy ride
Please remain come in the event of emergency

You didn't deserve this cruel invitation,
You didn't deserve this fucked up situation
I hope you had someone who loved you,
I hope you had someone to love

We can blame it all on the moonlight,
Is that good enough for you?
We can blame it all on the rising tides,
Revenge of the oceans blue

They'll blame it on you

I remember a little boy sitting next to me,
Sitting alone without a care of this world
I hope he had someone who loved him,
I hope he had someone to love

We can blame it all on the moonlight,
Is that good enough for you?
We can blame it all on the rising tides,
Revenge of the oceans blue

They'll blame it on you

Come and fly the friendly skies,
Oh what a frightening way that would be to die
Come and fly the friendly skies,
Oh what a frightening way that would be to die

Flashback to photos of you on your last birthday
Blow out the candles they told you to wish away
Daydreams of dying, the airplanes came crashing down
This is the day that you've always remembered now

You didn't believe in karma, did you?
I think that it believes in you

We can blame it all on the moonlight,
Is that good enough for you?
We can blame it all on the rising tides,
Revenge of the oceans blue

They'll blame it on you

I awoke among the burning, twisted wreckage
Choking on black smoke inside a field of fire
A turbulent fight brought me to this place and time,
A one-way ticket to the rest of my life
