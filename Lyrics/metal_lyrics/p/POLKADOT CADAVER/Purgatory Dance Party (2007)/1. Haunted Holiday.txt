Riding on a train that's a future runaway
Sleepin' in the desert on a haunted holiday
And now you're miles behind me
Just like the setting sun

Is that the best that you can do?
Who needs a death wish, when all I want is you?

If this is all a dream then don't bother waking me
Just let me sleep in this comfortable coma
And as you're standing in the sun
I'll be the ghost just hiding in the shadow

Is that the best that you can do?
Who needs a death wish, when all I want is you?
There's nothing more that we can do
Than listen to the rain, while staring a the moon

Where do we go from here on this desolate highway so far away from home?
Here we go again, chasing a ghost on a haunted holiday
Blistered from the sun, you are venomous and I know to stay away
Grains of sand are slipping through my hand as the moments pass away
