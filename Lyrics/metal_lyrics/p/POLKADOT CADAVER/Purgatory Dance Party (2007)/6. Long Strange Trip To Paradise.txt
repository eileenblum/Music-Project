Born in a coffin with lipstick on your cheek
I can't look away, I can't look away
Where have you been all night?
Your eyes are swollen shut
You can't see a thing now can you?

Valley girls in love with the decadence
Blindfolded, purging up the vanity
A kiss like a near death experience
(Sitting in the backseat of my daddy's car)
Oh yeah!

Buy the ticket,
Buy the ticket, take the ride
On a long strange trip to paradise
Buy the ticket,
Buy the ticket, take the ride
The pleasure's yours and the the pain's all mine

Rosemary's baby is rockin' in the cradle
Eyes wide and staring like she's hypnotized
Jacob's ladder is leaning up against the wall
(Every time I try climbing it, I fall)

Valley girls in love with the decadence
Blindfolded, purging up the vanity
A kiss like a near death experience
(Sitting in the backseat of my daddy's car)
Oh yeah!

Buy the ticket,
Buy the ticket, take the ride
On a long strange trip to paradise
Buy the ticket,
Buy the ticket, take the ride
The pleasure's yours and the the pain's all mine

Looking at you now I see
You're barely breathin', yeah you're barely breathin' now
You're barely breathin', yeah you're barely breathin' now
Peggy Sue, what the hell's gotten into you?
Call 911 for the 666, yeah
Call 911 for the 666, yeah

Dancing with the Devil's wife,
Begging her to take your life
Vapid little vampire
Is all staring at my jugular
We've made the nightly news,
And there's no way that we can lose
Smiling slave all dressed in leather,
What's your poison, what's your pleasure?

Buy the ticket,
Buy the ticket, take the ride
On a long strange trip to paradise
Buy the ticket,
Buy the ticket, take the ride
The pleasure's yours and the the pain's all mine

Looking at you now I see
You're barely breathin', yeah you're barely breathin' now
You're barely breathin', yeah you're barely breathin' now
Peggy Sue, what the hell's gotten into you?
Call 911 for the 666, yeah
Call 911 for the 666, yeah

Mascara's running in a marathon,
Palm reading hands across America
Sleep tight, loose lips are sinking ships
I'd kill just to be in your arms again
