You've got a face that only your mother could love
Beneath the make up and skin is only skeleton
Looking through your window when you're home and all alone
I'll swallow you whole with milk and spit out the bones

This song is not for you,
This song is just for me
La dolce vida in the city by the sea
Inside our honeymoon suite
Inside the belly of a whale
I want you lyin' face down
Upon a bed of nails

Say hello to my little friend,
My God, it's so good to see you again
Pure bedlam
For half breeds
Under the hot rain,
In this tropic purgatory
Pure mayhem
For OGs
I'm down with
Tippin' 40s to your memory

We are now the Bonnie and Clyde of the prison yard
Our love is firing bullets at the prison guards
We are now the angels of death breathing cyanide
Circling the sun, burning holes in the blue sky

This life is not for you,
This life is not for me
Now we've got our necks all stuck in a guillotine
Don't let them see your fear,
Don't let them hear you scream,
Just close your eyes and pretend it's a bad dream

Say hello to my little friend,
My God, it's so good to see you again
Pure bedlam
For half breeds
Under the hot rain,
In this tropic purgatory
Pure mayhem
For OGs
I'm down with
Tippin' 40s to your memory

(Harder, faster
You want it
Harder, faster)

Lullabies in a voice so sweet
To you and me and the Devil, makes three
There is no place like home,
But we are not in Kansas anymore
Rape becomes the new 'I love you'
Out with the old assault on the senses

Ashes of the mushroom clouds
Sulfur tears rain down
Whispers in the wind grow loud
My God, it's so hot down here
Hush little baby, dry your eyes
Don't cry my sweet Clementine

(Hello pharaoh, where's your halo?)

Say hello to my little friend,
My God, it's so good to see you again
Pure bedlam
For half breeds
Under the hot rain,
In this tropic purgatory
Pure mayhem
For OGs
I'm down with
Tippin' 40s to your memory
