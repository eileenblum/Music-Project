The snow is falling down
And Christmas is coming round
All the children count down the days
Until Saint Nick hops on his sleigh

But this year I paint my face
With tears perfectly placed
Under eyes bloodshot and dazed
Because you packed up and went away

I'm a sad Christmas Clown
Now that you're not around
All my holiday cheer
Has gone up in smoke
Now I crack the bottle
I wail and I moan
A sad Christmas Clown left here alone

When I was a child
Without a care in the world
I never would have dreamed that I'd find a girl
Who'd rip out my heart
And tear me apart
Cutting me down to the bone
Turning my love into stone

I'm a sad Christmas Clown
Now that you're not around
All my holiday cheer
Has gone up in smoke
Now I crack the bottle
I wail and I moan
A sad Christmas Clown left here alone

Sad Christmas Clown
