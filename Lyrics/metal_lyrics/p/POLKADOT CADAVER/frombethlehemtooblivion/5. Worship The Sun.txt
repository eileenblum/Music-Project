And on that day
Far from our homes
We shed the blood
Nobles turned rogue
Toppled the Gods
The king from throne
Go for the throat
Silence the moans

A heretic, a patriarch
Man into beast
Light into dark
Summon the slaves
Worship the sun
And build a tomb for the chosen one

Twas this time last year
Something in me died
I cannot feel
I cannot cry

A past once revered
Now only hateful hordes
Gather at the temple
With disease and with swords
A star is born
Now turn out the light
The sun will set
The son will rise

Father into your hands
I commend my spirit
Why have you forsaken me?

The son will rise again..
