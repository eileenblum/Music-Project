Low down rat, evil fly
Circling shit a mile high
You don't deserve a god damn thing for Christmas

Greedy slug, selfish prick
Smiling wide, convinced you're slick
You don't deserve a god damn thing for Christmas

Walking on the backs of the weak
Your karma drives a dead-end street

It makes no difference to me
I'll let it go, I'll let it be

Corporate shoe, religious twit
Such a blatant hypocrite
You don't deserve a god damn thing for Christmas

Evolution, forget that
Climate change, your wallet's fat
You don't deserve a god damn thing for Christmas
