This flesh palace is beginning to rot
Raw meat and bones in a boiling pot
Love profane, clog the drain purging my sins
The butchers at the chopping block
Shall we begin?
Death, murder, famine fill the emptiness inside of me
Television politician monkey brain
Lobotomy
A deviant welcome
To all new arrivals
A slaughterhouse striptease
A game of survival
now your naked
Hung up to dry
Dripping red roses
In a house full of flies
For a thrill ride and the time of your life
Come in Take a step a little deeper inside
Dressed as a clown
Iâm the master macabre sadistic
Drunk bloated nihilist slob
You canât deny me You canât even fake it
handcuffed
Turned around bend over and take it
Laying on a deathbed
Tied up in vines
Cut from the fabric
In a room full of knives
Shell shocked and writhing
Foam at the mouth
eat you alive till im 6 ft down
now your naked
Hung up to dry
Dripping red
Roses
In a house full of flies
Itâs a thrill ride
The time of your life
Come in take a step a little deeper inside
Wails and moans and prison cries
Echo in the dark recesses of my mind
You approach me peeling off your disguise
In the den of iniquity
The sun donât shine
Begging for forgiveness at your alter
