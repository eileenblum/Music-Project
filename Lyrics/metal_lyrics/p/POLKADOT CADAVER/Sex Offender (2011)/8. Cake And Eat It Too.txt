Black strap on a
Violent shade of pain
Rock hard Able and raising Cain
Harsh disciple and
The gimp is trained
To drop to his knees and
Take the blame..
Take what I give you
I want my cake and eat it too
With milk and blood and a piece of you
Look what sick love made me do
Pins stuck in my voodoo
Doll baby suffering in my hands
Will anyone on the hotline understand?
Iâm defiled and dejected
Suicidal and fully erected
Blood Rushing
and Iâm thinking
Itâs happy hour somewhere and I should be drinking
Black tar, hypo-shooting licorice root
Nymphs naked bareing forbidden fruit as I
Taste your peach out in the pouring rain
Orgasmic ecstasy insane
Straight jacket off 3, 2, 1 Rocket delight
Commit me to the psych ward in the cold
Dead of night
Meth head high and knocked off my feet
I canât decide if youâre a trick of a treat
Abracadabra cast your spell
Drown me in your wishing well. Exorcists, thousands surveyed
Say a zoloft a day keeps your demons away
Prescribe me anything but faith
I want my cake and eat it too
With milk and blood
and a piece of you
Look what sick love made me
Pins stuck in voodoo doll baby
Suffering in my hands
Will anyone on this hotline understand?
Iâm defiled and dejected
Suicidal and fully erected
Blood rushing and Iâm thinking
Itâs happy hour somewhere and I should be drinking
In the garden of Eden the
Molesting began
With a snake, and an apple, a woman and a man
Your lips tell me no but your eyes say take me
Overpower and indulge as you break me and rape me
Bottomed out inside of you
Iâm frozen lifeless and entombed
Beaten and the punishments due
I want my cake and eat it too
Written on the bathroom wall
The greatest turn on of them all
Molest me, caress me
Our bed becomes a grave
Before we blow ourselves away
