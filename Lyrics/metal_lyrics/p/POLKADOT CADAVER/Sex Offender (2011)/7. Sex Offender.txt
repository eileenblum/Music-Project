Black out crazy, makin babies
Dead soul
Jesus Christ canât save me
The walls drip sweat in cheap motels
Without a doubt
Should have pulled out
Teen spirits an awful smell
When Cast into a mid-west hell
Terminated
There were two
The life we spared was you
Heart spasms, slow decay
I canât look the other way
Your dedication I admire
As you set my world on fire
With your legs spread open wide
You invite me to cum inside and
I give and take my turn with
Lessons never learned
Snuff films shot in super 8âs
Swallow, suck and masticate
Playing doctor lick your wounds
Fillin up your waiting room
Candles burn in pitch black space
The Ouija board spells out your name
The se, the drugs, the decadent life
Plagued and cursed like a Kennedy wife
Make an example of me
Wake up sleeping beauty
Heart spasms, slow decay
I canât look the other way
Your dedication I admire
As you set my world on fire
With your legs spread open wide
You invite me to cum inside
And I give and take my turn
with lessons never learned
Tied to the whipping post
Give me Everything youâve got
Little demons Swirling in my head
a kiss goodnight and off to bed
Iâm a dirty bird
A filthy little pig
Thank you sir,
May I have another?
Beaten to a bloody pulp
Thank you sire
May I have another?
Rock and roll is a dangerous business
Just another victim, can I get a witness?
Laying in ruin Smoking in bed
Skull fuck the crowd gathered... off with their heads
Speaking of the devil just as she appears
Iâve had general pangs for a calendar year
Fanning the flames as temptation burns higher
Lust is a cheap and unforgiving desire
Make an example of me
Wake up sleeping beauty
