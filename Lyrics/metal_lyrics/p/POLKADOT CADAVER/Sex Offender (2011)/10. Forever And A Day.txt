Your alive, like a virgin after the first time
Pleasures survive by feeding on our troubled minds
As the planets align
I creep down your spine as
Emptying asylums spill out into the night
Take your time my love
And soak it in
Where one life ends another begins
Your alive, like a virgin after the first time
Kiss me tonight, as if it were the last time
Razor to wrist
I canât resist
If I could seize the day
Rather than merely exist
Iâll wear the suit
Youâll play the roll
A devil, a god a friend a foe
Waking from the coma
And I heard you say
What a perfect day to dream away
Not a cloud in the sky
As I close my eyes and
You sing me a heroin lullaby
Obscene and stuck here in limbo between insanity
And some sordid dream within a dream
I may be coming undone and
I want nothing more than to take you with me
Letâs go further than weâve gone before
Closer to the edge of disaster
Leave you inhibitions behind
Now Youâre a part of me that I canât deny
Transitioned to the other side
Far from our shallow graves...
This is paradise eternal love forever and a day..
