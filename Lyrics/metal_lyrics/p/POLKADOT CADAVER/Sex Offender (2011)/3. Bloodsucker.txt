Red moon rising
From behind the clouds
My nose to the wind
When hunting you down
Thin skin translucent
Blue veins
Seducing me to take you
Where we will live forever
Teens aspire to become vampires
I donât blame you
In fact I abhor you
Suck you Dry, we feed at night
Barely legal, I donât mind
Hit me baby one more time
Parasite, Iâm over wide
In the twilight of our discontent
Weâve shape shifted
And the changers are permanent
I have come to suck you dry
Immortal now
Avoiding the light
Run like hell
We feed at night
Teens aspire to become vampires
I donât blame you
In fact I abhor you
Behold set forth as sheep among the wolves
Headless preacher with arms swinging wild
Cold heart empty like a motherless child
With every tooth knocked out
With every vein collapsed
With all your pulsating fear
Weâll live forever here
