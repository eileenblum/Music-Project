My god is better than your god, therefore Iâm better than you
My god is better than your god, letâs start a war!!
I wreak havoc on planets that Iâve never been to
Iâll padlock up your heart just like a cage at the zoo
Spinning and stuck all up in my gravitational pull
Constellation mutation shift to
Taurus the bull
Weightless, floating
weâve arrived
Suspended in the silent night
A warm embrace
The Cyclops eye
Mass graves lit by candlelight..
Falling up into the sky we orbit fractured satellites
In heaven only you and I
Unanswered prayers and angel cries
Reborn new day golden dawn
The bounty hunters of Babylon
A warm embrace
The Cyclops eye
Winking at these stellar spies
Within a love completely un-corrupted
Lightyears from any earthly enemy
Like a pulsing flawless organism infinite
Were written in the starlight requiem
With no way to escape
You and I will find a way
All Evolution is crippled when
Dogma dictates..
My god is better than your god, therefore Iâm better than you
My god is better than your god, letâs start a war!!
