Paralyzed, You pass me as your sinking
I fight the waves you dig my grave
Into the ocean floor, a fragile mind
Capsized and blinded by a paramour
Mesmerized Iâm rising with the bends
Contempt growing like moss on the tip of my tongue
By guess and by God
For all and evermore
Flashbacks of love lost cast out to sea
Treasured hearts broken pieces
Rain down on me
Surging moon as our worlds collide
A king is born in starry skies
And now Iâm slowly quietly drifting away
Hypnotized, set adrift the swollen vessel
Immortal in the current pull
Far from the doldrums
Static ignites a foul berth in the sacred space between us
Now the light has faded into who I used to be
Memories in echoâs forever haunting me
You speak to me in a whisper
From your heavenly hideaway
In a violent sea of skeletons
Overboard and tumbling in
Reach your hand down from the clouds
and Hold my head under the water
Apathy stands the test of time
When leaving no one behind
Poseidon ignored
like a voice from within
An oracles warning
The salt on my skin
Deadly sea creatures begin closing in
The octopus, electric eel, the shark and the squid
hanging from a rope to mend the devil
As rolling thunder scrapes across my back
A piercing stare from my weathered eyes
and without hesitation I begin my attack
Until today a bloodless existence
But now the waves  roll over red
In this odyssey the enemy will suffer for
The first to attack is the last to be dead
Opus Dei
There will be no other way
In the ancient order of the deep
Iâll rock the maritime to sleep
Until returning on my dying day
Empty this sea grave shall stay
