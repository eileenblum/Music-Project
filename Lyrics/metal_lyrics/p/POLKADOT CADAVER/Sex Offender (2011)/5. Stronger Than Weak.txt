Your not the only one
So go and have your fun
Iâm contagious and Iâm bringin it home to you
Every life forsaken
Slow deep breathes
Iâm takin
A clear shot in my sight
The bulls eye is open wide
Spread across my skull
And you wink and guide me in
Possession en route
Split me down the middle Iâve become so...
Weakened by the will to be
Stronger than your love for me
Crazy hearts in padded rooms
Close to death so far from you
Rock your body back and forth
Foul rhythms pumping in time
Brain stems, rose pedals
Damaged goods, infected minds
Sterilized, anesthetized surgery begins
Heavy eyes lids, cold steel scalpel cuts across the skin
Iâve become so...
Weakened by the will to be
My eyes roll back I scream your name
Losing form and spilling out
nothing but the air that I breathe
We play Truth or Dare
Till were Black and blue, unbreakable
I lay back inside you
And before I can speak
With sweat dripping off of your cheek
Whispering softly you repeat to me
Show me that your stronger than weak...
