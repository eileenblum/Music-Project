Wipe away the drool
Before someone sees you
Close your moth and focus
On Doomsday hocus-pocus
In order to control
Invent someone theyâll fear
Then name the enemy
Make their agenda clear
You are the prodigal son
And now you are the chosen one
You are a weapon of mass destruction
El presidente mongoloid leads
A nation to disfunction
Heil mein fuhrer
Feed me to the lions
Rape and pillage
Bathing in oil
A jihad on the poor
If egos slowly atrophy
From outer space to inner peace
Tell me than how should we start?
With an olive branch or a stake thru the heart?
A fly in the ointment
Writhing cancerous
A safe distance from genius
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Sly as a fox network
Nazi hitler youth
A sample on a slide and a toast to genocide
If egos slowly atrophy
From outer space to inner peace
Tell me then how should we start
With an olive branch or a stake through the heart?
A fly in the ointment
Writhing cancerous
Wake me up when Rome begins to burn
Your Ivy league
A legacy In ancestry
Blood runs deep
Founded in the mason creed
Were all slaves
On puppet strings Survival of the working class
Echoâs of desperation
Entranced distracted squeal like pigs orgasmic
Staring like zombies into their television screens
Armageddon keeps me soaking in
My wet dreams
When angers all consuming with sickness blooming, an esoteric disguise
Out of body, out od mind
Out of hope, and out of time...
Welcome to the new world order
Heil mein fuhrer
Feed me to the lions
rape and pillage
Bathing in oil
A jihad on the poor
As egos slowly atrophy
From outerspace to inner peace
Tell me than, where do we start?
Ann olive branch or a stake thru the heart?
Bestial, estranged, prolific and deranged
Hail to the chief
A tremendous effort indeed
A fly in the ointment
Writhing cancerous
Wake me up when Rome begins to burn...
