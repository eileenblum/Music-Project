Graveyard shifts in the garden
Dirt under your nails
You've been hiding from the sun
Leather skin, cold and pale

You've been thinking of a girl
When you were a younger man
Who stole your breathe with her smile
As she took the flowers from your hand

And then she walked away, Never to be seen again
And then she walked away, Never to be seen again

Perhaps it was a dream
A callous on your soul
Soil under your knees

While you were digging that hole
And planting the seeds
Will they ever com to thee?

Far more beautiful than you, Remember her to be
Far more beautiful than you, Remember her to be

Day after day
You'd peer out your window
Praying that the seeds will grow
Into a blooming crescendo

A symphony of roses, that sing to your heart
A sweet lullaby till death do you part
And the very next day
As you peered out the window

There they were
To your suprise
A symphony of roses
That brought tears to your eyes

A sweet lullaby till death do you part
A symphony of roses that sang to your heart
