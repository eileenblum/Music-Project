You and I were meant to be
At war, eternally
Two lone battleships at the sea
Staring at the enemy
Nurturing the urge to destroy
Escape becomes a dirty word
When you try to kill the pain
Rolling up the coast, top down, in a daze
I don't know where I'm going
But I'm feeling good
Whispers in the wind, head spinning around
I don't know where I'm going
But I'm feeling good
In the valley of dry bones
We burn the fat off our souls
Where everything is meant to be
Infamy and obscurity
Now hunger and our thirst is raw
A primitive survival song
Where everything is meant to be
Sucking and gnawing like baby teeth
Choose your poison
Walk the edge between
Overdose and tranquility
Fear becomes a dead friend
From sweet release, to the bitter end
When you've got nothing to lose
In the valley of dry bones
We burn the fat off our souls
Where everything is meant to be
Infamy and obscurity
Now hunger and our thirst is raw
A primitive survival song
Where everything is meant to be
Sucking and gnawing like baby teeth
Battle ready, From the cradle to the grave
Write the menu of become the menu
I see you clinging to air
My ghost is holding your hand
A master, mistress and slave
Aboard a ship with no name
The mockingbird sings your song
From twilight until the dawn
To carve a path out of light
To set the soul into flight
In the valley of dry bones
We burn the fat off our souls
Where everything is meant to be
Infamy and obscurity
Now hunger and our thirst is raw
A primitive survival song
Where everything is meant to be
Sucking and gnawing like baby teeth
Painkiller! Painkiller! Painkiller! Painkiller!
