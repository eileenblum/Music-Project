Call man a human, but I feel like an animal
The world's a jungle, we build and destroy
No wonder why, we cage the wild beast
As their appetite's grotesque
Voraciously increase

Dog eat dog, spit it out, feeding the homeless
Empty confessions, compassion escaping me now

I am what I eat, what's the beast to do?
Who am I to feel for those destined to fail?
Only the fittest will ultimately survive...

Lions feed on inferior breeds, I consume, therefore I need..
Eating of God's vital seed, delicious indeed..

I feel nothing now, except the need to keep on feeding
Canines sink into flesh, my eyes roll back
I pour salt on your skin
This is my kingdom, where you all have your places
Consuming all, even their faces

Lions feed on inferior breeds, I consume, therefore I need..
Eating of God's vital seed

You are beautiful indeed, don't take it personally
We are what we eat, don't take it personally

Dog eat dog, spit it out, feeding the homeless
Empty confessions, compassion escaping me now

Lions feed on inferior breeds, I consume, therefore I need..
Eating of God's vital seed

Swallowing the roaring seas, I am nourished, not by your charity
But the fact that you are weaker than me

Don't take it personally
