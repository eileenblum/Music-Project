Batten down the hatches
The devils got the wretched twitch
Send in the cold assassins
With a blitzkrieg fever pitch

All the eyes on you
Hypnotic voodoo
An overnight sensation
Isn't that what you wanted?

Global sodomy
Earthly catastrophe
New world order
Thy will be done!

Starlight, starbright, who we gonna kill tonight?
Vermin in the burrows? Hunters in the shadows?

All the kings horses and all the kings men
Sent to fight a rich mans war have come home cold and dead
In the forest of hanging bodies, we're feeding the trees
Blood, sweat and oil and plastic apologies

Into the jaws of death
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Big war, big business
Moral suicide

Starlight, starbright, who we gonna kill tonight?
Vermin in the burrows? Hunters in the shadows?

All the kings horses and all the kings men
Sent to fight a rich mans war have come home cold and dead
In the forest of hanging bodies, we're feeding the trees
Blood, sweat and oil and plastic apologies

The worm has turned, The cities have burned
The sky is on fire, Your children are dead

The worm has turned, The cities have burned
The sky is on fire, Your children are dead

All the kings horses and all the kings men
Sent to fight a rich mans war have come home cold and dead
In the forest of hanging bodies, we're feeding the trees
Blood, sweat and oil and plastic apologies

Starlite, starbright, who we gonna kill tonight?
Compassion to calm the empire
Or fall the way of Rome
Bring your sons and daughters
Your brothers and sisters home
