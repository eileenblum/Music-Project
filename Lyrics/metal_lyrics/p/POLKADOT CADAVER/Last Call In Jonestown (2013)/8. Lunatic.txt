It only hurts, if you let it in
Feeding on muscle, under your skin

Spread out the pieces, the look on your face
Scatter the ashes all over the place

In my heart, you are an infection
In my eyes you are divine
Strange machinations involving my ultimate demise
On the block, inch by inch, all over you,
Skinned up soul, Foul religion imprisoned in your womb

It only hurts, if you let it in

I'll take the wheel and pull of the road
Teach you a lesson, before we get home

Which one of us is the lunatic?

In my heart, you are an infection
In my eyes you are divine
Strange machinations involving my ultimate demise
On the block, inch by inch, all over you,
Skinned up soul, Foul religion imprisoned in your womb

I only shoot when you drive by
Bullets fly, fill the sky, Oh my, oh my
I only shoot when you drive by
Bullets fly, fill the sky, Oh my, oh my

Death spasm, You ain't innocent
You made your bed, now lay in it
Guilty pleasure and pestilence
You broke the leash and jumped the fence
Death spasm, You ain't innocent
You made your bed, now lay in it
Guilty pleasure and pestilence
You broke the leash and jumped the fence

You know you'll never get away
