Black and blue, covering you with dry dead leaves and witch perfume
You're an obedient slave. A vulture pecking shallow graves
The moon, the stars, the sun
The aftermath, what's done is done

Named betrayal by your mother, now slither away
Your lust for another is a sinful display
No past, no future, only now!
Swinging a cat and taunting the crowd

You don't wanna know, what I've been thinking
While your castle was burning and your ship was sinking
I belt out that hook, imperfect pitch
Trapped in your head, Stuck in your lip

Love... Love, love, love...

Cradle your foul creation, A deformed infant
Just skin, teeth and hair
Convince it to love you or beat it to submission
Preserved now, set it in a jar
Years have passed, You've come so far
Slow march to the gallows pole
Denial at this point won't bring the nipple to the babies mouth
Or keep my soul from flying south
I'm an insatiable creature
I want what I want, I want what I want, I want what I want
And I want it now!

I know you felt the same way
Clip the achilles on game day
We'll make it hurt
Leave you a cripple
I know you felt the same way
Clip the achilles on game day
We'll make it hurt
Leave you a cripple

You don't wanna know, what I've been thinking
While your castle was burning and your ship was sinking
I belt out that hook, imperfect pitch
Trapped in your head, Stuck in your lip

Spirit men, fight through the crowd
Spinning around and upside down
Cracking whips and heart attacks
Lust and desire, carved in your back

Flesh on flesh
Skin on skin
Take me to hell your in
