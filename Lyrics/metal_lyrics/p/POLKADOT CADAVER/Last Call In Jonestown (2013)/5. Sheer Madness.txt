Behind every fortune is a great crime
Future dividends begat my past lives
White walled cuckoos nest
Chemically calmed, we smile and sing
A night at the opera, a day at the races
You should have seen the look on their faces
A lifetime of sadness, turns to sheer madness
God only knows why
I found Jesus under the sink
His hair was long, his cheeks were pink
Now I smile and sing
La la la la laa laa laa
I've found Nyquil quite delightful
To calm the nerves, you goddamn right it will
Make you sing: glory to the newborn king
A night at the opera, a day at the races
You should have seen the look on their faces
A lifetime of sadness, turns to sheer madness
God only knows why
The end is near
Repent or enter the lake of fire
The day of reckoning's upon us
Judgement day has come
A night at the opera, a day at the races
You should have seen the look on their faces
A lifetime of sadness, turns to sheer madness
God only knows why
The flies at the altar, the pawns in their places
The exorcists voice, and the acolytes faces
A lifetime of sadness gives birth to sheer madness
As god sits alone in the sky
