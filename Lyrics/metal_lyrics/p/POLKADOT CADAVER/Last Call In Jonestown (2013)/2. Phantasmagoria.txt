Bodysnatchers and the holy ghost
The lamb of god and the headless goat
Posessing the masses and the misanthropes
White platinum stars slit their golden throats

I'm still here hustling, paying dues to the latest henchmen
Pennies from heaven, never enough charity to go around

Is it phantasmagoria, feeding the hysteria
Smoke and mirrors, make your escape
Heretics and sleight of hand
The poltergeists are back again
And now we're sleeping, sleeping with the lights on

Stigmata rising on my face and hands
While building castles with the sandman
By candlelight we eat our last meal to
Newborn cries and pig squeals

Phantasmagoria, feeding the hysteria
Smoke and mirrors, make your escape
Heretics and sleight of hand
The poltergeists are back again
And now we're sleeping, sleeping with the lights on

Only fear lives here now...

The omens, the covens, green witches, faith healers
The omens, the covens, green witches, faith healers

Our curiosity has come back to, to haunt us
Our past has come back to, to haunt us
Our sins have come back to, to haunt us
Our fears have come back to, to haunt us
Our past has come back to, to haunt us
Our sins have come back to, to haunt us
Our fears have come back to, to haunt us
After the blood, sniffing like dogs

Only echoes and fear remain, Only echoes and fear remain

Is it phantasmagoria, feeding the hysteria
Smoke and mirrors, make your escape
Heretics and sleight of hand
The poltergeists are back again
And now we're sleeping, sleeping with the lights on

Only fear lives here now...
