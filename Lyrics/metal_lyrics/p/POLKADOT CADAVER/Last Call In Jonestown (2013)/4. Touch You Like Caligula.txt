You're all mine, The world is mine
You're all mine, The world is mine
If I touch you like Caligula
Will you be my Mary Magdalene?
I'll dress you in my mother's clothes
From her closet full of skeletons
You're all mine, The world is mine
You're all mine, The world is mine
The road less travelled led me to Salem's Lot
Where the devil in the details, tied my neck into a knot
Our cancer is blooming like a flower
Shatters the glass holding the hour
If I touch you like Caligula
As curious as Oedipus
Into the darkest of desires
To consequence I grow remiss
Take a step closer to the edge of what you fear
Behind you looming silently, you feel me drawing near
Your pounding heart now is the only thing you hear
With my hands around your neck I whisper in your ear.
Midnights eternal in this wine soaked bacchanal
Sky high on venom while bonding with the beast
No rest for the wicked, no compassion for the weak
A marriage of power, now the world is all mine
Seven deadly sins, where do we begin?
Seven deadly sins, where do we begin?
You're all mine, The world is mine
You're all mine, The world is mine
Take a step closer to the edge of what you fear
Behind you looming silently, you feel me drawing near
Your pounding heart now is the only thing you hear
With my hands around your neck I whisper in your ear.
Midnights eternal in this wine soaked bacchanal
Sky high on venom while bonding with the beast
No rest for the wicked, no compassion for the weak
A marriage of power, now the world is mine
The road less travelled led me to Salem's Lot
Where the devil in the details, tied my neck into a knot
Our cancer is blooming like a flower
Shatters the glass holding the hour
