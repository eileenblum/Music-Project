Sunday mantras repeated together
Predict second coming's, I forecast the weather
Snakes never bite us, gathered we sing
God is our shephard, the glory, the king
I'm knocking on your hearts door, let me inside
Follow me now, let me be your guide
Gather now children and welcome the dead
And silence the beast inside of your head
Last Call! Last Call! Last Call in Jonestown
Bottoms up, Swallow the hemlock
Drink from the cup!
Last Call! Last Call! Last Call in Jonestown
Bottoms up, Swallow the hemlock
Drink from the cup!
Pupils dialated, roll over white
I am a witness to Heaven's bright light
Join hands now ye faithful, In worship we sing
But the light is too bright, I can't see a thing
Save us now father from what we've become
Bring us together now as one
Guide us to paradise to Jesus the son
Save us now father from what we've become
Last Call! Last Call! Last Call in Jonestown
Bottoms up, Swallow the hemlock
Drink from the cup!
Last Call! Last Call! Last Call in Jonestown
Bottoms up, Swallow the hemlock
Drink from the cup!
