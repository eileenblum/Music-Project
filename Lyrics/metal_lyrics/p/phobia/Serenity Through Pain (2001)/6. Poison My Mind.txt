I amâ¦ an anarchist
Despise me if you will
I amâ¦ the flag burner
That you want to kill

Through an attempt you willâ¦ find
You canât poison my mind

Poison My Mind
Poison My Mind

I amâ¦ the filth
In society I will reside
I amâ¦ the truth
Something you want to hide

Through an attempt you will find
You canât poison my mind

Poison My Mind
Poison My Mind

Compromise my hate
You fucks donât matter, fuck your patriotic ways
Compromise my hate
Iâm stern in my place, Iâll live by my ways
Compromise my hate

Through an attempt youâ¦ will find
You canât poison my mind

Poisonâ¦ poisonâ¦ poisonâ¦ poison
