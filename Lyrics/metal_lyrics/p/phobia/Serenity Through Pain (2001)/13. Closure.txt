[Info in the lyrics sheet:]
âIs there hope for self solitude?
Does sovereignty work in ways to compromise?
Fuck all that is apprehensible to my natureâ¦
Insurrection against the coercion!!!â

Was this lust, your fate to be
Now brings a wrath, for your stupidity

Who destroys, a complete environment
A selfish fuck who exists through insecurity

From all this, you have a lifeless line
Your name is dead but, Iâm still alive!

No blood runs through
The betrayal is on you
No blood runs through
The betrayal is on you

The betrayalâs on you!

Your compassion is a tool
I guess itâs the way for a weak ass fool

A vulnerable state, so you rape minds
Take your needs but you have nothing left inside

From all this, you have a lifeless line
Your name is dead but, Iâm still alive!

No blood runs through
The betrayal is on you
No blood runs through
The betrayal is on you

Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain
Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain
Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain
Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain

Your lifeâs a pain, youâre put through shame
Your lifeâs a pain, youâre put through shame
Your lifeâs a pain, youâre put through shame
Your lifeâs a pain, youâre put through shame

Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain
Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain
Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain
Your lifeâs a shame, youâre put through pain

No blood runs through
The betrayal is on you
No blood runs through
The betrayal is on you

Thereâs no closure today!
