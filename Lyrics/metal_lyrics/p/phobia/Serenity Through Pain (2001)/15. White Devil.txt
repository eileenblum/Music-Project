Call me white devil
Thereâs no hate in me
Thereâs no dispirit while you
Dispose you blame!

Disassociate, animosity,
Your pride advocates
Your power is no different than the KKK

Call me white devil
You speak inveigh to me
Hate crimes, discriminate, fuck you
They go both ways

Disassociate, animosity,
Your pride advocates
Your power is no different than the KKK

Weâre all minoritiesâ¦ governed by hate
Weâre all minoritiesâ¦ within a social plague
Weâre all minoritiesâ¦ governed by hate
Weâre all minoritiesâ¦ within a social plague

Call me white devil
Thatâs not my identity
Ignorant fucks like you enable this social insolence
