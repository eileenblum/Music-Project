This is your interrogation
For millions of murdered souls
What do you have to say for yourself?
You're one more on the death toll

This is the campaign for no tolerance
Through this, you will see
Intolerance, no sympathy

Death threat, death threat
Death threat, death threat

All the pain you've endured
Blood shed while you conquered
It's all in your hands while you fall
One more on the death toll

This is the campaign for no tolerance
Through this, you will see
Intolerance, no sympathy

Death threat, death threat
Death threat, death threat

Break you to your knees
Break you to your knees

[Solo]

Death threat, death threat
Death threat, death threat
