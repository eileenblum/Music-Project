This faith through manipulation you contend
A weakened conscience, deceived until the end
You might as well put a bullet in your head
No Chris to save youâre already deadâ¦ already dead!!!

Nailed down to the stake through shame!
Iâll give you something to ease the pain

Mercy killing
Mercy killing
Mercy killing
Mercy killing

Whereâs the honor while dying with your guilt?
Accomplish nothing the reminisce your fault
You might as well put a bullet in your head
No Christ to save your already deadâ¦ already dead!!

Nailed down to the stake through shame!

Mercy killing
Mercy killing
Mercy killing
Mercy killing

1/3 population remains blind
Youâre the whore within the system
That bleeds you dry

Bleeds you dry while
You try to make sense
If this is the case
Itâs already the end

Mercy killing
Mercy killing
Mercy killing
Mercy killing
