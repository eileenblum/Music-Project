Pray to save, for fathersâ sake
But your faith, feels like hate
Persistent to, a retributive siege
You attack me, this I see

Slave to religion
Slave to religion

Your perfect life is a fallacy
Read the good book, chastise me
Slander the father the daughter sees
Christ has got, you on you knees

Slave to religion
Slave to religion

My frustration!
This is my frustration!

Prayâ¦ for a father sake
Prayâ¦ your faith feels like hate!

Iâm the sinner laughing down at you
My existing presence, is what weakness you
Iâm the sinner laughing down at you
The whore resides in your holy house, with god and you

Slave to religion
