âLife is painâ¦ get used to it!â
Weâre locked in a world to feel
Breathe and suffer our surroundings
You fucking suffer!

Possessiveness of control
That bleeds and kills

Senseless acts, corruption we feel
Weâre confined, trapped the cycle never heals

Live to slave, suffer âtil demise
Ongoing oppression to maintain our lives

Sufferâ¦
Suffer!

Weâre locked in a world to feel
Breathe and suffer our surroundings
You fucking sufferâ¦ suffer too!
