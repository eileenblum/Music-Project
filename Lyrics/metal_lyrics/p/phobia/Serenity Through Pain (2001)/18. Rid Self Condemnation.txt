Donât stand next to me
I have a madman to contend to
He lies and cheats and steals
Through his eyes itâs better not to feel

Hey you donât bring that shit on me
I know what the fuck you mean
The sores the blood the anxiety
It keeps the cycle of insanity

Iâm a reflection of pain
The more self torture the more I gain
The constant complaint with me
The shit, the hate, the things I see

Youâll see
Youâll see
That I need
To be free

When Iâm dead theyâll have nothing good to say
Shouldâve been locked, confined, put away

Tortured
Tortured

Youâll see
Youâll see
That I need
To be free

Hey you donât bring that shit on me
I know what the fuck you mean
The sores the blood the anxiety
It keeps the cycle of insanity

Youâll see
Youâll see
That I need
To be free
