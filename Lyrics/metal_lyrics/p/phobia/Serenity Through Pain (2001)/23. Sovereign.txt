I am not completeâ¦ Iâm not complete
And to feel the ambiance, of my own defeatâ¦
I am not completeâ¦
This is to beâ¦ the vanquish of my dignityâ¦

I will ariseâ¦ and to ensueâ¦ my rage,
To be sovereign, through serenity, through pain!
through serenity, through pain
through serenity, through pain
Painâ¦ painâ¦
