When this manifest displays the pain
Livid, confusion canât come to refrainâ¦ whatâs to blame?
Try to preclude distend the mood
Fuck the distress the ongoing feudâ¦ whatâs to blame?

Lifeâ¦ misery!

Mental Incarceration
Mental Incarceration

Through frustration my mind will cede
Anxiety disorder everyday asperityâ¦ whatâs to blame?
Numb like a callous I fail to dissuade
The fucking distress the ongoing feud... whatâs to blame?

Lifeâ¦ misery!

Mental Incarceration

Must be careful who taunts your mind
Oblivious to the impassible what will they find!
Must be careful who slanders the disturbed
Oblivious to the impassible what will they find!

Is it all in my mind?
Is it all in my mind?
Is it all in my mind?
Is it all in my mind?
