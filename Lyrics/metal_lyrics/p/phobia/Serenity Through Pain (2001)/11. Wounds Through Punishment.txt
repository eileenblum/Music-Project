Anger has an endeavor
Where shame has no place
Anger is the justification
Youâll feel the hate!

Reign of terror
Your crime your fate
Reign of terror
I wonât hesitate

You want this pain?
It will cleanse your shame
You want this fucking pain?

These wounds, are through, your punishment
I guess thereâs hell to pay!
These wounds, are through, your punishment
I guess thereâs hell to pay!

These wounds, are through, your punishment
I guess thereâs hell to pay!

The guiltâ¦ lies with youâ¦
Lies with you!!

The feudâ¦ is on youâ¦
Itâs on you!!

These wounds, are through, your punishment
I guess thereâs hell to pay!
These wounds, are through, your punishment
I guess thereâs hell to pay!
