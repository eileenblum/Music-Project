Like the sheep, in the factory who dies
Youâll be next through, societyâs lines
The bloodshed a billion times
Next it will be you, social sheep

Like the sheep, in the factory who dies
Youâll be next through, societyâs lines
The bloodshed a billion times
Next it will be you, social sheep

Close your eyes, shit your mouth,
Plug your ears, close your mind

Mindless sheep

Social sheep

Close your eyes, shut your mouth,
Plug your ears, close your mind
Follow sheep, blinding sheep,
Mindless sheep
Stay in line

Like the sheep, in the factory who dies
Youâll be next through, societyâs lines
