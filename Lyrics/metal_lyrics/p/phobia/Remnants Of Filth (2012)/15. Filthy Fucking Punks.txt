Time to charge, time to destroy
Cuts and bruises, a lifeâs story
They like to say, we have no respect
Maybe those fucks just feel a threat

Filthy fucking punks!
Filthy fucking punks!
Filthy fucking punks!
Filthy fucking punks!

A reign of terrorâ¦ an insurgency
Bullets and protest and anarchy!

Filthy fucking punks!
Filthy fucking punks!
Filthy fucking punks!
Filthy fucking punks!
