What has been toldâ¦ about others who depend?
What sort of challengesâ¦ can we expect to pretend?

Failures put aside
You concerns and lies

We once could prevail
From addiction we can fail
A point of attitude
Or bottom out and loose

Contradiction
Contradiction
Contradiction
Hail to a shitty ways

We face our hurtâ¦ in solid ways
We have unjust to decline
To contradict our plays

Contradiction!!!
