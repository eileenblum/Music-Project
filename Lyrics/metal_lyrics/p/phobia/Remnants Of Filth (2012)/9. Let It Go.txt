Who are youâ¦ to say to me?
Go fuck yourselfâ¦ and your shitty ways
Who are youâ¦ to say to me?
Youâre shallow I donât want to stay

Presence is torture
Means nothing when youâre insecure
Donât live for what they say
Youâre a person I donât fear

Let it go! Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!

Frustration becomes to anger
You donât like my self control
Push to a situation
Itâs getting fucking old

Let it go! Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!
