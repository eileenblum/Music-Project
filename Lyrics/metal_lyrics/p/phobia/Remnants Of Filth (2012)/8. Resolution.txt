Sterilize consumption
No breathing down your neck
Ride the insensitive bastards
Bring hell to the lunatic

Resolutionâ¦ bring us back to life
Resolutionâ¦ itâs time for them to die
Resolutionâ¦ bring us back to life
Resolutionâ¦ itâs time for you to die

Itâs our preservation
To reclaim our possessions
Abstraction isnât an option
When we face our own destruction

Resolution! Revolution! Revolution!
Bring us back to life!

Resolution! Revolution! Revolution!
Bring us back to life!

Resolutionâ¦ bring us back to life
Resolutionâ¦ itâs time for them to die
Resolutionâ¦ bring us back to life
Resolutionâ¦ itâs time for you to die
