Search in your soul for a way to live
Makes no difference if you must forgive
Iâm sick an addict, youâll ill deceive
When Iâm drunk you donât want to fuck with me

My life
Is sickening
Is this what I believe?
My life
Is sickening
Is this what I believe?

Need to restore my sanity
Departed from morality
Live, breath, sleep demons within
Want to not feel this ever again

My life
Is sickening
Is this what I believe?
My life
Is sickening
Is this what I believe?

[Solo]

My life
Is sickening
Is this what I believe?
My life
Is sickening
Is this what I believe?
