Worship ideas
That couplet the way you feel
Optimism gets you killed
Aggravation you wonât ever heal

Force upon insurgence

Freedom isnât free!
I hope you learn and see!
Freedom isnât free!
Hope you learn to see!

Blood that spoils
For your persistent ways
Resolution has been taken
Your disposition has found its way

Freedom isnât free!
I hope you learn and see!
