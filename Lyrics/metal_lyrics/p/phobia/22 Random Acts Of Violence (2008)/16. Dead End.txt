Dead end!
Dead end!
Dead end!
Dead end!

Dead end
That's what you'll see
So you better believe

Dead end
No hope for life
The end in sight!

When Christ has risen, the people will lose expression
Animals still suffer from human devastation
Political corruption, the roots of all evilness
Powers that destroy, hostile deviance
