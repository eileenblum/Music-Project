Who are the oppressors
We look them in the eyes
Who contributes to murder
Is it the citizen's right?

Anarchy is not a solution
It's an alternative to a bullshit scheme
The war is fought in our city streets
Leaving death and defeat!

Blood that streams from the weak
Blood that streams from the weak

Solutions can be buried
With those who have seen their graves
Revolt, self destruction
A first that has to change!
