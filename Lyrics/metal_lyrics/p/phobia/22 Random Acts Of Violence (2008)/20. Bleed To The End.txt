It's easy to feel dead
When there isn't any light
To feel a worthless doom
That over hangs your life...

Overall, we're bleeding to the end!
Overall, we're bleeding to the end!

The cold of a feeling
The despair I have fought
Remnants of the healing
Depressing every thought!

Embrace your demise
We bleed to the end

Bleed to the end
Bleed to the end
Bleed to the end
Bleed to the end

Overall, we're bleeding to the end!
Overall, we're bleeding to the end!
