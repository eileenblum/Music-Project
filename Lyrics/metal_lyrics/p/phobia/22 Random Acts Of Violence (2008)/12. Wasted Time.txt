Gangs to prostitution to CIA
Government has a conquest, a vision that's insane
Capitalist onslaught leaves victims to remain
Ignorant fucks that turn a blind eye away

Wasted time!
A life full of deceit, watching people suffer, you're killing on the streets
Wasted time!
Through the killing machines, humanities struggles, to feed into their regime

This is your America, is this your dream?
Self imposed battle fields, to contribute to the means

One of many conspiracies to social defeat
Millions of lives ruined with terror on the streets
Gangs and government
Oppressive works of hate, a solid activist said
