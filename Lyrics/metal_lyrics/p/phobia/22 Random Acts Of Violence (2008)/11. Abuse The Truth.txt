Looking through the windows
Shadows that always seem to haunt
Justifying the obvious
So you can remain calm

Honesty a profound ideology, but we always seem to abuse the truth!

Lives will never change, it s plagued with one own guilt

Believing until the dead end, exhausted beaten, you will never win!

Abuse the truth
