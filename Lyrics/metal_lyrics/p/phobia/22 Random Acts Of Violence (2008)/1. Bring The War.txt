What was broken, wasn't always in defeat
A revolution s collapsed, but isn't on kneeling feet
Those who became victims on a heroic battled street
Lived for the chaos, that s the ideals and beliefs!

Another stage
But it s just another rage
Set into force
Smashing this state
Fallen lives
This point they die
Insurgence to Fear
The war is here!

Bring the war
And see your demise!
