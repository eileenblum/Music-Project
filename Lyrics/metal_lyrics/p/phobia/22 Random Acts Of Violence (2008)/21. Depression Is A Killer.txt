Is that oppression
Attacking me again
It never seems to leave
Always seems to begin
Maybe slit my own throat
To bleed so-called sins
Love and hate is so fucked
Put this to an end!

What's the point to try?
Depression's a killer inside!
What's the point to try?
Depression's a killer inside!

A fragile existence
Is a horrid sign
It makes no difference
For what you try to find
You live in mental fear
And hope to only die
The end is coming
This must be my warning!
