People always waiting because their hope has never died
Selfish acts of reason is what they always find
Violence born of hatred, these means have done their deeds
You preach about some fucking change and do your coward ways!

Rise up, build self esteem
Take control, don t take the fall!

You see disasters every fucking day
You mind goes racing and stressing has it s way
Rid all this burden and kill your self disease
Rise up, get up, stop living on your knees!

Rise up, build self esteem
Take control, don t take the fall!
