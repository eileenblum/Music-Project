So you want to protest cops
Express your anarchist thoughts
Live, breath and absorb the ideals
That your fucking taught
2 days a week and feel like you fought
It s a full fledge insurgence is what you thought
Revolution systematic change
Doesn't happen with your fucking games!

Anarchist farce!

Refuse a system that you want to exploit
In the name of punk while you shoot your junk
Fuck shit up and fuck the state
Now you put them in their place
Studded belts and tattooed face
That has nothing to do with smashing the state
Your freedom exists and I m game to this
But we need to fight, so punks unite!
