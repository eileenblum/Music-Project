From my pain-Hatred came
Emotions lost- Eternal strain
Losing Grasp-Forever lost
Nothing left-Internal Rot

Internal Rot

Fear of life-Fear of pain
Losing Grasp- Of whats inside
Destroying emotions- A shattered mind

Stricken me down
Below my own insight
Internal Rot
Eating my body alive!

Internal Rot
