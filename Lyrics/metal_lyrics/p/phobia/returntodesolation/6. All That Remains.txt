Our mother earth
Is dying for your greed
Starving hungry people
Are left to feed
Money and power
Takes control
But nothings left
to feed the world

Extinction of Mankind
Is on it's way

Economy is failing
What's to do
There's no future
For me and you

We just sid
And wait to die
From Disease, hunger
Or another lie

Nuclear age of warfare
Predicting death is near
Dictatorship and politics
Fills our lives with fear

Bodies piling on the streets
Children suffering as they bleed
Our mother earth
Is dying for your greed
Annihilation

Buildings burning to the ground
Ashes falling from the sky
Death, confusion is all around
Annihilation

Extinction

All that remains
