Do you ever think what's near?
Your greedy minds pollute without fear

Chemical pollution
in the lake
Chemical discharge we can't take

Its going to come back toyou (it burns)
It will affect you too (it hurts)

Burning eyes your hair falls out
Rashes on the skin never come out
No hope for anything more
The greedy bastards just want more

Its going to come back toyou (it burns)
It will affect you too (it hurts)

It will come in effect
The garbage now will be down your necks
No hope for us what's done is done
Stop their ways
Chemical fear is on its way
