Eating flesh we are taught to respect
Humane conditions is their aspect
Hypocrite
necessities engaged in discretion

Reversal in revolting bloody intentions
Is our given life an exchange for death
To urge a certain power of dominance

Your indulgence is a sickening torture
Invisible to the truth you stand for
Stubborn to the form of stupidity
And you show your felicity
Feed the power no more
The sick murder you conquer
Construct the mind
Not hypocritical lies

Is our given life an exchange for the death
To urge a certain power of dominance
Your complete force degrading humanity
