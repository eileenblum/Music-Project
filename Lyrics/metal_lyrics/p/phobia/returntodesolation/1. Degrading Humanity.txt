Thousands of years in the making
Man's inhumans desire, controlled by money and greed
Disaster to profit, the cycle of hate
That will destroy our lives, the oppressor will devastate, and lead us to our demise

Degrading Humanity
Inhumane act of permanency
Extinction of human resources
To satisfy political forces

Horrendous display of greed and unconcerned
The works of evil governments to satisfy their mania

Degrading Humanity
Inhumane act of permanency
Extinction of human resources
To satisfy political forces

Corporate death stalks the Earth
The lives of the innocent, controlled by a force system
A failed system of selfishness and greed
Endures no safety or future of mankind

Disease ridden from unhealthy environment conditions
Bodies drop from starvation, sickness and exhaustion

Degrading Humanity
Inhumane act of permanency
Extinction of human resources
To satisfy political forces
