Recognizing the lies
of modern society
Oppressive power
structures that hold self-autonomy

Systematically imprisoned

Questionâ¦ how can we be inviolable?
Refuseâ¦ use the social shackles that hold self-liberty!

Establishment that confines existence within a freeâ¦ democratic society

Overlook theirâ¦ power and refuse it!
Make your ownâ¦ path which makes them powerless!

Social, political imprisonmentâ¦ relies on ignorance
Your ignorance is their power â Questionâ¦ how can we be inviolable?
Refuse, use the social shackles that hold self-liberty!
