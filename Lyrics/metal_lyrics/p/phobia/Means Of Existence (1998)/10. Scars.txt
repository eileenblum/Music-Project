My painâ¦ it comes within
It comes from you
Life slowly fades (away)â¦
Itâsâ¦ destined to


Abuse myself
The things Iâve felt
Emotional infant tragedies
Has ruinedâ¦ socialâ¦ capability

Abuse my soul!

Keep myselfâ¦ in line
Blew it time after time
Itâs true what they say
Scars neverâ¦ go away

Abuse my soul (x4)
