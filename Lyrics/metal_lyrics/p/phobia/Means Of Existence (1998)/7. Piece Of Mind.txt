To find freedom must we hang ourselves
To rid hostility and disappointment

Piece of mind

Is the tradition of self-centeredness
One that strengthens within (Canât even be overcome)

My mind bleedsâ¦ in senseless hopeless grief

To find freedom must we hang ourselves
To rid hostility and disappointment

Piece of mind

[Verse missing lyrics]

Lack of stabilityâ¦ prisoner of my own mind
Striving to overcomeâ¦ the pressure inside

Mentally fatiguedâ¦ I still search inâ¦ hope to find
A life without tormentâ¦ to achieve peace of mind

Piece of mind
