Resisting
Protesting
Decentralize groupsâ¦ of strategy
Means of existenceâ¦ for individual dreams

Speak ofâ¦ speak of revolution, speak ofâ¦ speak of change
Too sectionally, too sectionally divided, we oppress, we oppress the same

Unifiedâ¦ Socialize our coalition for social independence
The dividedâ¦ is whatâ¦ lacks the supportness

Speak ofâ¦ speak of revolution, speak ofâ¦ speak of change
Too sectionally, too sectionally divided, we oppress, we oppress the same

Society consists of two classes
Those who ruleâ¦ and those who must obey
Without unityâ¦ things will be unable to change

Speak ofâ¦ speak of revolution, speak ofâ¦ speak of change
Too sectionally, too sectionally divided, we oppress, we oppress the same
