Iâve seen the children suffer
For they lay feeble ridden with disease
Cries of our children, stricken to death and poverty

Never did they choose this life they suffer severely

Livingâ¦ in a media exploited world
Strivingâ¦ to create change out of self-righteousness

The assholes who choose to live
Within their own comfort
Are the same fucks
Who brought this oppression upon us

Infant suffering [2x]

False aspiration, leads to political games
Bombs before change, is their true ways

Infant suffering

Millions suffer, millions will die
No apathy, just fucking lies

Infant suffering [3x]
