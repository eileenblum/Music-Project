Inseparable, an emotional bind
Value compatibility, a connection I canât find

Why canât you see? Why canât you see?

Respect, toleration is all that I ask
Incapable of change, too much of a task

Vision (of change)â¦ a resistance to be built
World trembling by for you
By convenience youâre fueled

Stink head [4x]

Inseparable, an emotional bind
Value compatibility, a connection I canât find

Why canât you see?
Why canât you see?

Respect, toleration is all that I ask
Incapable of change, too much of a task

Why?
Why?
Why canât you see?
Why canât you see?
