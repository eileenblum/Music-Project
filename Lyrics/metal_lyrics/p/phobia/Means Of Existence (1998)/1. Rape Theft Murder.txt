Misled by passion for patriotism
Only the lies that speak heroism

Rape, theft, murder â Thereâs your American dream [2x]

Fuck you!
My voice will remain heard
Iâll shatter your nationalismâ¦
from truth, you wonât accept it but youâll learn

Schooled through false knowledge of independence
Lies that maintain the cycle of manipulation

Rape, theft, murder â Thereâs your American dream [2x]

Your classâ¦ your class statusâ¦ your lies
Fuck you!
My voice will remain heard
Iâll shatter your nationalismâ¦
from truth, you wonât accept it but youâll learn

Abolish the thoughts
That strive to make America a better place
Your patriotic bullshit is a disgrace

Rape, theft, murder â Thereâs your American dream [2x]
