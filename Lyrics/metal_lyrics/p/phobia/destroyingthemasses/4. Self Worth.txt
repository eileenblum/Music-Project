What is it that burns
Soulless within humanity
Face the harshness of pain
As it comes too

What's our self worth?

What's our position, in life?
The ultimate spiritual struggle
All I want is to flow, like the river and be clean
Have no part, in this suffering

What is this that destroys?
Our regard for life
Only sadness to contribute
As to respect we're immune

"What's our self worth?"

We need to
Grasp a position
In our life
Give us self worth

Have no part, in this suffering

What's our position, in life?
The ultimate spiritual struggle
All I want is to flow like the river and be clean
Have no part in this suffering

"What's our self worth?"
