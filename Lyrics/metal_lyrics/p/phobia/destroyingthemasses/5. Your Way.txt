What do you think? What do you hear?
Well, I'm not plagued with needless fear

No need - to justify
No need - to clarify
Whom are they â are they to say
Your own path, is your own way!

Your own path is your own way!

What do you feel? Because it's real
When your teeth clinch
And cannot control the rage
When see fit, your action will test
Don't be ridiculed, through scene fascist ways

No need - to justify
No need - to clarify
Whom are they â are they to say
Your own path, is your own way!

Your own path is your own way!
