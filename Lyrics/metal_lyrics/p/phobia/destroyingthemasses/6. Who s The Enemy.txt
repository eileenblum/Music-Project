[Incomprehensive intro]

Are we fascist, in our own affairs?
I've seen only hostility towards others than theirs
Is there passion, is there a cause
Their bullshit pacifism, we'll take the loss

It's all the same

Why is this, their abuse?
Why is this, their abuse?
Why is this, their abuse?
Well I will refuse

We must lengthen, our equality
Who do you think, is the default of humanity

I've heard the word of control
When the finger points the hate unfolds
There's no difference
When will we see?
It's ourselves who's the enemy

It's all the same

Why is this, their abuse?
Why is this, their abuse?
Why is this, their abuse?
Well I will refuse

It's all the same
It's all the same

There's no difference, when will we see?
It's ourselves who's the enemy
