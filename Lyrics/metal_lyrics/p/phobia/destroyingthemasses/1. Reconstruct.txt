All I want, is to destroy
All that is bad, within my life
Some good aspiration, to rise up
Break it down, fuck shit up!

Within oppression, lies many faces
Either trait, confines you with fences

Destroyingâ¦ the masses
Destroyingâ¦ the masses

The threshold stands through classes
Reconstruct your life, leave them ashes

Destroyingâ¦ the masses
Destroyingâ¦ the masses

They'll take your spine
They pray on weak minds
Isn't that enough for you?
Take self esteem
Take dignity
Isn't that enough for you?
Break free!

Suppressâ¦ break down
Suppressâ¦ break down

Have you noticed, our willingness to obey?
Gets us nowhere struggle by day
Suppress the power
Break down the classes
Take back our lives
Destroy the masses

Destroy the masses!
