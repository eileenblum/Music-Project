I will not, loosen my hold
Of whom I was, or have become
It's my individualism, expression of life

It's Iâ¦ who needs
It's youâ¦ who expects

Pick apart me, rehash ideas that tremble to your feet

It's Iâ¦ who needs
It's youâ¦ who expects

Feed from others, no mind of own
Shallow arrogance, has only shown

Don't need your shit, when you can't relax

It's Iâ¦ who needs
It's youâ¦ who expects

Oblivious
