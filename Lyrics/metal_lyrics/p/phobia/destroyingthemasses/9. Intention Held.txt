If I could crucify, I would nail your body
To the cross and witness what I see
Insurgence to control, your vision of conquest
The reality you don't have to perceive

There's a weakness
Shared in your favor
Your slum of patriots
But not I

Intentions hold
Intentions hold

You take minds
You take pride
But not I

There's a weakness
Shared in your favor
Your slum of patriots
But not I

Intention hold... Intention hold...
Intention hold... Intention hold...
