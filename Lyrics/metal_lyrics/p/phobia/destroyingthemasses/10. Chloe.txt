There is one way
That goes, day by day
Not to off myself, and throw it all away
Maybe she sees the eyes, of a man
(That has) nothing but love her way
I should appreciate
For the incentive
For those cheated and swept away

Iâ¦
I don't want this anymoreâ¦
This must be the terrible side of us allâ¦

What do you think then?
Is there, a coward who lives within?
Screw all the hopes and dreams
Doesn't want, doesn't need
Please come this way
So I, can embrace you through the day
This is my life
It's our life
It's so inconsiderate
To think this way

I don't want this anymoreâ¦
This must be the terrible side of us allâ¦
I don't want this anymoreâ¦
This must be the terrible side of us allâ¦
