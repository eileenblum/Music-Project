Falsified intention
Weak at the mind
Take only what you need
You depend and feed

I donât need you
I donât need you

I donât need you
I donât need you
I donât need you
I donât need you

These peopleâ¦
That you seeâ¦
They want controlâ¦
They have no soulâ¦

Will see these things
And we see it in you

Your lack of stability
Is something that weakens you

Falsified intention
Weak at the mind
Take only what you need
You depend and feed

I donât need you
I donât need you

I donât need you
I donât need you
I donât need you
I donât need you
I donât need you
