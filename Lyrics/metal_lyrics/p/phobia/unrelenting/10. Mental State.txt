So much sufferingAnd distorted mindsIs this called living?No reason to be alive Serenity is a mental stateBacked up frustrationsDepression destroys your fait Through mental interventionThrough solitude you'll find your placeLife has courses that are beyond our controlDo not look to another face Face your downfallChallenge your plagueIt's yours to burn Never ending sufferingTo be born a hurtful thing
