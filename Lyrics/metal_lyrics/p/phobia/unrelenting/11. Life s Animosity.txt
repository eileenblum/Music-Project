It's a killing nightmare that overhangs your lifeEveryday struggle, give me a fucking knifeIt brings out your soul... it brings out your soul Means of a solution... to reign your sanityMeans of a solution... it's life's animosity Humanity can not spareThe weakness that is clearThe struggle can seeThat you will be desiredUnfold your animosity
