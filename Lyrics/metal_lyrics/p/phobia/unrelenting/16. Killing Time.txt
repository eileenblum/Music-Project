Pieces of shattered hurtAre all that remainsOnly going deeper through your veinspain and sorrow that kills! Killing time... continues lies Fragments of thoughtsHeal but you can't feelSuicidal thoughtsBut then you'll rot Killing time... continues lies Everything burnsEverything turns... seen through eyes
