Tradition of power that hangs over your headPolitics through media, mentally we end up dead Live for chaosLive to destroy Break down the towers that confine you with power!Enrage through the change that has always plaguedThrough your conviction, rid their tradition! Live for chaosLive to destroyBreak down the towers that confine you with power!
