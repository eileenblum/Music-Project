Extinction is what we have becomeNothing learned and nothing gainedAll that hope has washed down the drain Insurgence failed, who is to blame?Dying for who? Brought into a world through a sight unseenNothing to complain but those that are of greedDeath plagues and hasn't yet compromised In a world of sufferingthat leads us to our demise!Dying for who? Start a militia to even the scoreNever ending battles, we have fought before
