Death comes to us allIt's a bloody soreEverything is tornLifeless you are born! Rehashed... remnants of the bornRehashed... life has no remorse Consistence to persistenceBuild your self-esteemLifeless life has solitudeMentally can be confused Rehashed... remnants of the bornRehashed... life has no remorse Life is full of imbecilesI can see the ending...
