I know you like to pull your PC trip but you always seem to lie and want a drama gripYou like to feed the scene and try to demeanBut listen you'll never be me! You don't matterYou don't matterJust a fucking cowardYou don't matter Learn your lesson on how to be coldUnder pressure you always seem to foldIgnorant fuck that has no self-esteemBut listen you'll never be me!
