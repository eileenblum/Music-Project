another death, another day, another name
fuck these atrocities and all the bullshit
patriotic hyms Bush and all his endeavors
4 more years and the nightmare begins
ignorant americans!

peasants fight, the rich get gold!
mass anxiety that's the fear that they
control thousands dying
that doesn't get old?
another death, another day, another name
