life's pressures has a cold long stare
it takes strength to even feel or to care
a frail existence humans to be torn
seek for that affection

nothing can compare
kill to love
when desperation takes its toll
kill to love
when you feel nothing at all!!!
our faith has to suffer
grief blackened existence
what have we become
to want this need? [repeat]
loving, hating, and killing!!!
mortality has taken what minds we
have sought nothing can mend the
damage that we've done!!!
