cursed, cursed, cursed, are we in hell?
cursed, are we in hell?
the scourge lies with us every single day
we rid ourselves of progress
lack with moral decay
cursed from beginning to end
there must be a heaven
because we reside in hell
godd looks down and laughs at us
as our exsitence fails
[repeat]
