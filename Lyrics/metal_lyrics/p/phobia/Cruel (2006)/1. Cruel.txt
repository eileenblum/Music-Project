CRUEL!!!
Birth into passing,
Chapters in our lives,
Oppressions that confine,
The enemies and his lies.

No sympathy for your apathy,
There's no remorse just cruelty.

Cruel!!!
Immortality has its endeavors,
Violence has its place,
Through life's anxieties,
It's the curse of humanity [repeat]
Frustration....want to kill it all!!!
Cruel!!!
