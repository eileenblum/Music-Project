You had some self esteem
So much beauty that I see

Drug abuse to self abuse
You need to see it through
Drug abuse to self abuse
How he needs to be with you

Like a bullet in your head
You will most likely wind up dead

Drug abuse to self abuse
You need to see it through
Drug abuse to self abuse
How he needs to be with you

Fix your self you fall so deep
He tries to wake but your in eternal sleepyou need to see him grow.....
