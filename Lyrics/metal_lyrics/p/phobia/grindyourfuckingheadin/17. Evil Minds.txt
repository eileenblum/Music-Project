Evil minds have a price...
Despicable behaviors, through love and hate when you loose grasp, anguish is your fate

Evil minds have a price...
Agony of it all, we learn to adjust and kill just another piece that pertains to the thrill

Immortality always conquers
Through the misery of it all

Evil minds have a price...

[Repeat]

Immortality always conquers
Through the misery of it all
