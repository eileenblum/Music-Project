We bring the violence
A new society of nihilists
To a filthy police state of whores
And their vehemence
A period of influence an era of insurgency to exterminate the authorities and their perception of liberty...

Regulate the sovereign state

Restraint and riot

How can they say there's prison walls
When I don't feel confined
See to your self autonomy
With this you defeat their fallacy

Restraint and riot

Use your strength and over whelm
The possibilities of the enemy
Fire with fire and provoke some violence use aggression and the fury

Restraint and riot
