Sling the ink in the skin
Feel the pain that as it go's in
Creating pictures of life memoirs
Feel the addiction you want some more

Sick... life

Blood is drawn but we see it through
Just a compulsion nothing new
A noise that gratifies your every mood
My spirit's lifted to the devils tune

Sick... life
