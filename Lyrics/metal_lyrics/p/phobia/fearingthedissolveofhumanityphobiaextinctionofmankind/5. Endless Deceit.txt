[performed by Phobia]Feed from failure
to boost self worth
emulate others
you have no source
Peace and equality, itâs a profound ideology
The so-called serenity
Destroy with its abilities!

Endless deceitâ¦
Endless deceitâ¦
Your only crime is yourself being deceived

Deceive yourself, in shambles of make believe
Only holding your ideals
But youâve become, a part of the scheme
The so-called serenity
Destroy with its abilities!

Endless deceitâ¦
Endless deceitâ¦
Your only crime is yourself being deceived
