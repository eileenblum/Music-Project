[performed by Phobia]Why does it have to be, peopleâs hurt from other grief?
These challenges are a part of life
Fuck those assholes Iâm not going to fight!
Out of mind, out of sight!

Those rigid souls
They canât be alone
Feasting on their prey
Ignorance is the only way
A life thatâs fitting
Disgusting minds are pretty
Through shadows your words
Will lie with your mind you will die

Life it seems to kill
Human ignorance at will
Life it seems to kill
Human ignorance at will

This hurt is a part of life
Through agony you would think so minds
The worst enemy
Looking for self autonomy

Life it seems to kill
Human ignorance at will
Life seems to kill
Human ignorance at will

Those rigid souls
They canât be alone
Feasting on their prey
Ignorance is the only way
A life thatâs fitting
Disgusting minds are pretty
Through shadows your words
Will lie with your mind you will die
