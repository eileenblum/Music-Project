[performed by Phobia]We got blood from oneâ¦ and blood from another
Whatâs the priceâ¦ that keeps the struggles together?

From one to another
Rid the onslaught of the aggressors

Have nothing but hostilities, when unison becomes insane
The chain that strength the hate
Is the same, that determines our fate

From one to another
Rid the onslaught of the aggressors!

[Solo]

From one to another
Rid the onslaught of the aggressors!

We got blood from oneâ¦ and blood from another
Whatâs the priceâ¦ that keeps the struggles together?
