A collection of manipulated slaves
The stateâs dominion of evil ways
Enemies ideals of self-serving benefit
Working for their power while we remain powerless

Rendered powerless to stateâs aggression
Laws, tools to maintain peopleâs frustrations
One third of the population remains blind
Controlled, enslaved or suffer your demise
