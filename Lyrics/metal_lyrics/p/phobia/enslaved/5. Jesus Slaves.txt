Lack of securityâ¦ and self-esteem
Look for a superiorâ¦ to set you free

Deprive your moralistic standards
Become manipulated from the endeavor

JESUS SLAVES
Manipulated by their hypocrisy
JESUS SLAVES
Enslaved to old mythology

Your greed that betrays hate
Barriers that discriminate
The creation of power
Youâre enslaved to conquer

Judge meâ¦ for what I am
Despiseâ¦ where my ideology stand

JESUS SLAVES
Manipulated by their hypocrisy
JESUS SLAVES
Enslaved to old mythology

Shed blood by your hands
Kill the sinners while you can

Feel free to let your mind go
Onward to freedom, peace in your soul
Free your mind as it has evolved upon me
You being enslaved and morally deceived

Jesus slavesâ¦
