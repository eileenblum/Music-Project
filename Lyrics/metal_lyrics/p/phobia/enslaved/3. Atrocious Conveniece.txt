[Info in the lyrics-sheet:]
âChimpanzees differ from humans in their genetic structure by less than two percent. The bond between a mother chimpanzee and her offspring is just as strong as it is in a human family.â

Millions die an atrocious display of brutality
Massacred, tortured and enslaved for human convenience

Animals murderedâ¦ for their greed
Profit from bloodshedâ¦ no longer proceed

The existence of oneâs lies deceased upon their hands

The machine that sacrifices life to the endeavor
Is the same that Hitlerâ¦ used to extinct a raceâs future

An uncontrolled desire of wealth to their demands

This invention that proclaims the safety of all
Is no more than a cruel sick profit-making holocaust

Burn the labsâ¦ which cause the horrendous torture
Put the machine on those who have conquered
