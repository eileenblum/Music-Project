âIâve come here to create a new country for you called chaosâ¦ and a new government called anarchyâ

Iâve seen the children suffer
For they lay feeble ridden with disease
Cries of our children stricken to death and poverty
Never did they choose this life they suffer severely

Livingâ¦ in a media exploited world
Strivingâ¦ to create change out of self-righteousness

The assholes who choose to lie within their own comfort
Are the same fucks who brought this oppression upon us

INFANT SUFFERING

False aspiration leads to political games
Bombs before change is their true ways

Millions suffer - millions die
No apathy - just fucking lies

INFANT SUFFERING
INFANT SUFFERING
INFANT SUFFERING
