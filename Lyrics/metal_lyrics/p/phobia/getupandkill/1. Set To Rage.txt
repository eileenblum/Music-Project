You're born to exist
It's the origin of self-indulgence
Life's course is grim
Reject the conceit
And rid the sin

Kill that disease... Kill that disease!!!

Send blood to stain... Send blood to soil

Set To Rage... For Their Misery
Set To Rage... For Our Atrocity
Set To Rage!!!

[Repeat]

Mendacity manipulates
Malicious means
See to your self ideals
Struggle to attain

Kill that disease... Kill that disease!!!

Set To Rage... For Their Misery
Set To Rage... For Our Atrocity
Set To Rage!!!
