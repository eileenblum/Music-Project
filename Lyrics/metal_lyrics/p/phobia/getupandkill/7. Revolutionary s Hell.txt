I've felt the cold cell
A distinctive place that I know well
No system can seem to falter me

Attach yourself
From what has gone
Abhorrence comes clean
A political detainee

Revolution... A Day In Hell

Contest and defiance
Through a hectic rage
The bars conceal
A voice that's real

Revolution... A Day In Hell
