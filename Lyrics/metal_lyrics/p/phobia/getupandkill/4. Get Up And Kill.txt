It's our position
To be fierce
If our means
Are sincere

It's the intolerance
that will prospect their demise

Get Up And Kill

Voices of inequality
It's where you want to be
To come and arise
Their nightmare has arrived

Are we to be that of the evils...
Through a violent deadly insurgency...
Has frustration taken a mental path...
Fuck them all, I give them no sympathy...

Get Up And Kill
