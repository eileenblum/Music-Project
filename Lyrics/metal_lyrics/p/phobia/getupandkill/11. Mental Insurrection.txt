Burn them and their sins
Kill faith and oppressiveness
Divest their fascist decree
Set your path to be free

Mental Insurrection
A Harsh Life With A Spineless Side
And A Feeble Mind Is A Frail Sign

Control is their constraint
The basis to terminate
See this as your faith
The strength is in your place

[Repeat]

Mental Insurrection
