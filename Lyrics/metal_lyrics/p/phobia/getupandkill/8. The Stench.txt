13 years... and no flesh for me
No carnage no blood
And no disaster

The Stench

Never needed... part in this cruelty
My conscience needs to be clan
No filth and nothing obscene

Sickened course... adulterate pores
Brainless identity... consume is stupidity

Dead and spoiled
You devour filth that plagues
Contaminated remains

The Stench
