Lots of bombs... but they are all gone
Children breathe their last breath
And families parish like the rest

You Follow
The Adversary's Lead
Time Will Seize

I see no alternative
Kill toleration rule
Execute all those who believe
Or they are murderers to

You Follow
The Adversary's Lead
Time Will Seize

Animosity has no edge
Just the undying disgust
That will be their end

[Repeat Chorus]
