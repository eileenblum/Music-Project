Punk for us was a vision of growth
A movement for change
A dream to break free
This chance to take part
In the larger world
And challenge its roles of oppression

I was inspired by the bands in this scene
Who expressed the concerns of imbalance
We've used slogans and images to protest injustice
Yet it takes action to back the word

We plant the seeds of revolution and watch the tree grow!!! [x3]

It is important that we
Take these messages as inspiration
But it can be a danger to paint some as leaders
When they are capable of becoming opportunists

No one is perfect in this struggle
And we must learn from our mistakes
Yet we have to be critical of those who would
Uses this for their glory
We do this because of an unfailing belief!

We plant the seeds of revolution and watch the tree grow!!! [x3]

And now, as we have watched this movement develope,
Punk has split into two
One side values image and profit
While we struggle to build something new

It is sad to see some view rebellion
As only limited to reactionary action
They disrupt our contribution to freedom and revelution
Their only goal is to be a pointless sensation!

We plant the seeds of revolution and watch the tree grow!!! [x3]
