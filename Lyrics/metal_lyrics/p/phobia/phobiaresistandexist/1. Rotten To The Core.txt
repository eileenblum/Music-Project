Committed the crimes where their structure lies
Felonious abuse to suppress and defy
Opposition I will try,
Burn this fucking system along with the lies

They call me a heathen or just an anarchist fuck
I believe in the rebellion that will finish them up because...

I AM ROTTEN TO THE CORE
I AM ROTTEN TO THE CORE

Ignite their fucking bodies
Screams are anthems to my ears
Opposition I will try,
Burn this fucking system along the lies

They call me a heathen or just an anarchist fuck
I believe in the rebellion that will finish them up because...

I AM ROTTEN TO THE CORE
I AM ROTTEN TO THE CORE
I AM ROTTEN TO THE CORE
I AM ROTTEN TO THE CORE
