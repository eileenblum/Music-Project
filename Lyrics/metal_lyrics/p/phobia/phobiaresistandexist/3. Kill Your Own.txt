Hate... is what brings the light of day
Pain... is what I hope you gain

Cruelty is given, blood shed you sustain
Racial suppression, you point the blame
I'll give you no sympathy for the murdered souls
Through the streets you kill your own

THESE ATROCITIES ARE NOT ON MY SKIN
THESE ATROCITIES ARE NOT ON MY SKIN
YOU KILL YOUR OWN
YOU KILL YOUR OWN

Carnage left by sadism, I see the hate
Nothing but conditioning as the racism unfold
I'll give you no sympathy for the murdered souls
Through the streets you kill your own

THESE ATROCITIES ARE NOT ON MY SKIN
THESE ATROCITIES ARE NOT ON MY SKIN
YOU KILL YOUR OWN
YOU KILL YOUR OWN

Your blood is soon to flow!!!
Abhorrence is your defeat

THESE ATROCITIES ARE NOT ON MY SKIN
THESE ATROCITIES ARE NOT ON MY SKIN
YOU KILL YOUR OWN
