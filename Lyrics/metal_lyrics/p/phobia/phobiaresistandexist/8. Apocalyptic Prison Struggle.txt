The solidarity of the streets must extend beyond to those arrested
We must prove to these freedom fighters that they will never be ignored

This song is for political prisoners
Forgotten by their own movements
To these people who have committed to challenging injustice

Let us put an end to our priviledged, sectarian squabbles
Regardless of the label the fight is for Liberation!

This song is for political prisoners
Forgotten by their own movements
Do not forget the inhumane condition, the despair of ultimate oppression
It takes more than writting letters,
We have to fundraise and rally,
We have to educate the public,
We have to study the role of prisons

This song is for political prisoners
Forgotten by their own movements
Regardless of political difference these people cannot be abandoned
Psychological torture, humiliation, and inhumane abuse
Isolated in cells deprived of life
Their families destroyed at the hands of the state
Rougher times for activists because they're a threat
The struggle must continue strong for the liberation
Free the prisoners, ALF, ELF, revolutionaries
The state repression must be dealt with until all are free...liberation or death!
