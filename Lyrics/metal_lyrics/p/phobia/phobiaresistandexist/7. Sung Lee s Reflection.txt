As I stand before this mirror
I am afraid of what I will see
Of who and what I will become
Of the person that stands before me

Blink once - blink twice
I no longer see myself
I see my father's eyes
His aging face stands before me

Oh father be strong
Your war is over
Though your nights are long
Soon you will see the sun
And the children will play again

Oh father be still
My mother is gone
She had found comfort in the arms of another one
The days will turn into years
But I will always be here

Oh father be silent
Your eyes scream all the pain you have inside
I hear you, yet you never cry
A man should be brave and have pride
Never questions, never ask why?

As I stand before this mirror
I am no longer afraid of what I see
Of who and what I have become
Of the person that stands before me
Blink once - blink twice
I see myself
In my father's eyes
His aging face no longer stands before me
