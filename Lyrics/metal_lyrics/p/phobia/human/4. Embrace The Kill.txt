Observe the current state. Our civil rights they rape. While the blood is running through the cracks they manipulate confection facts. The terror we embrace. Why are things so safe? Everything is made of paper mache. Marshall Lawâs not far away. Social structure in decay. Who is really civilized?
These lies. These lies. Bury you alive. These lies. These lies. Some will not survive. These lies. These lies. Bury you alive. These lies! Educate read between the lines, there has to be a better life. All dead in time. We're all guilty of this crime. They have bought and sold. Our lives are forced controlled. All dead in time. We're all guilty of this crime. This crime! Educate read between the lines there has to be a better life.

Situations out of focus. No one even seems to notice. Bureaucracy to cloud our minds. Born to serve the government swine. Confrontations getting closer. We must all oppose this order. No corporate thieves. No more controllers. To regiment our natural lives. Take a look at what's around. Hidden eyes that documentÂ· Better ways to buy and sell you. Embrace the Kill a world of shit. No Corporate Thieves. No More Controllers. Hidden eyes that documentÂ· Confrontation getting closer. Embrace the Kill a world of shit.

Embrace the Kill. The blood will spill. What the fuck are you going to do about it?
Embrace The Kill. A world of shit. Mal intentions sold.
The media swayed your eye, programmed before you know a slave until you die!

American Ideals provide you with an escape. Justify the ignorance. Personify the hate. In the midst of the chaos and the worship of a Christ. Oil price to coincide. Consumption of our lives. Objection overruled. The violence took their place. One world money soon to enslave the human race. In god we don't trust. Let me say it to your face. The Trap is set. The Solution. We need revolution world wide.

Embrace the Kill. The blood will spill. What the fuck are you going to do about it?
Embrace the Kill. A world of shit. Now this story has told a fact or just a lie.
Educate, read between the lines. There has to be a better life.
