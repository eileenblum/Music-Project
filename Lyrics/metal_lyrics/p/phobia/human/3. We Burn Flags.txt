we burn flags - true patriots has lost its stand.
we burn flags - to smash the oppression of the higher hand
we burn flags - to demonstrate against right wing klan we burn flags - to show loyalty and love of the land!
freedom doesn't come from a fucking cloth - but ignorant pride and lives' lost
is that what you call loyalty to the sovereign state - you sacrifice your body only be blown a way!
wars are for the rich that's why there fought - don't believe the hype of terrorist thoughts
you imperialize a counties day after day - your going to fucking DIE for the USA
destined to bleed selfish greed - destined to bleed for there needs
ignorant pride your blind can't see - maimed or dead that's all you'll be!
we burn flags - the same that drape the body bags!
we burn flags - fuck the state you'll end up dead
