As the Stock Markets open - as the City wakes up
See the masses clock in to whore another day at their dead end job
They got their mortgage sorted - Seem to have made it in life
See their faces featured in the weekly special of the Financial Times

dead inside, dead inside
just a useless product with an ignorant mind
dead inside, dead inside
kissed your life goodbye career suicide

It aint that plain and simple - aint just an easy ride
Cos when you look at the small print their so called success has got an uglier side
How come there's global starvation - how come there's wars to fight
It's that same system you work for of greedy corporate genocide
