[Music: E. Vizla, J. KrivÄns lyrics: E. Vizla]

Dark days upon my dear kingdom
Rumors spread as fire in the reeds
My people stricken by cold anguish
The smell of burning floats above our fields
To crush the Turk with iron hands
Our knights will ride, when midnight strikes

The army gathering like storm
Sent by the Raven king to war

They coming hateful in their bloody thousands
With weapons sharp and deadly, (devoid of mercy!)
And many nations have already fallen
Before the might of Ottomans
The enemyâs advance is to be halted
Black ravens soaring high this day

United under royal banners
Earth shaking when they charge!

The terrifying screams of both men and horses
The clash of swords and commands shouted
Many died this day and many fled the field
Ambitions drowned in sea of blood and chaos

The ravens soaring high this day!
The Black armyâs marching onward!
Fear will darken the invaders minds
Crying to the heavens, hope abandoned!

This fight is over, let the weapons rest
The sound of trumpets rings through air
Blessed was this day with luck and glory
Immortalized in chronicles of old

Yet be not blinded by the splendor
Of victories and mighty deeds of war
For enemy is always there and watchful
Their wounds will heal, theyâll come again!

Yet ravens claws are sharp and swift with anger
To face the Turks, the Poles, the Holy Romans
On land and sea, with guns and armor
Sent by their Raven king to war!
