[Music: J. KrivÄns lyrics: E. Vizla]

The longships are burning and the flames go up high
To the sky the smoke rises, and memories turn to ash
The waves are silently mourning the fallen and lost
Forgotten in foreign lands, not praised in the sagas

The longships are burning and the age draws to a close
Burning together with their gods, the heroes of old
Deeds of valor and of cruelty are engraved in the rune stones
Fading as the years pass, gnawed by the rain and the wind

The longships are burning and shadows of fire are dancing
Seen from afar upon the cold waters of darkness
The black mountains stand guard to this funeral
And the ghosts of the past howling among their spires

The longships are burning, and soon it will all end
A sorrowful parting, a fatal knowing of destiny
Still grief is greeted with laughter, bravery not forsaken
The glowing embers sink down but the song is lifted to skies.
