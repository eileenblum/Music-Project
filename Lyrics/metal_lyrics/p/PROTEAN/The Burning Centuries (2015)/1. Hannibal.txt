[Music: E. Vizla, J. KrivÄns lyrics: E. Vizla]

Across the sea his ships set sail
The wind was sharp as daggerâs blade
Heart cold and dreadful, mind contemplating
The thoughts of vengeance and of conquest

The frozen Alps, with many hardships
To challenge his unyielding army
His voice is roaring through the air:
Endure, withstand, donât turn away!

The mountain pass is steep and deadly
And savage blizzards blind the eyes
From cliffs, the men and elephants are falling
Their bones will freeze for centuries!

Hamilcar Barca, the Suffet of Carthage, ordered his servants to summon his son to swear a solemn and terrible oath against the Roman enemies:
When I come to age, I shall pursue the Romans with fire and sword and enact again the doom of Troy.
The gods shall not stop my career, nor the treaty that bars the sword, neither the Alps nor the Tarpeian rock.
I swear to this purpose by the divinity of our native god of war, and by the shade of Elissa.

The son of Baal will turn the tide
Against the Jaws of Roman wolf
His legacy is graced with pride
His star of fortune glowing bright

The new day brings the rays of sun
Upon the armor, horses, weapons
Make haste, the lines must close!
The wolf awaits, his fangs are sharpened

The fight was hard and many died
The wolf was beaten, yet unbroken
Withdraw he must, his country calling
To fall with him, to dust, to ruinâ¦

The jaws of wolf have turned the tide
Against the son of Baal so mighty
Yet in their nightmares Romans shiver
Of dreadful name of Hannibal!
