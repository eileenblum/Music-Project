[Music: J. KrivÄns lyrics: E. Vizla]

The sound of oars in the darkness
And of harsh voices from the mist
Something is moving in the night
Distant fires glowing from east

The sea-worm will rage and the ocean will rise
The wolf will howl and the winter will come
Those who have fought and died with warriors honor
will stand with their gods for their final glory

The ship made of the nails of the corpses
Naglfar, the bringer of fear
Going to war,
The final war
To end it all in flames
Strength and courage
The final sacrifice of blood
My vengeance is dreadful.

The madness of fire will swallow the world
and the chaos will come as the battle is fought
Heroes and gods, monsters and giants, everything falls
The age of great deeds will gone forever!
