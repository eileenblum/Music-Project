[Music: J. KrivÄns lyrics: E. Vizla]

My voice is singing from the grave
Upon the winds in autumn rain
Can you remember me, do you recall
How did I fight, how did I fall?

I am no more, my flesh is dust
My armor is adorned with rust

As pale remembrance of days old
The bony hands still grasp the sword
The mortal glory, songs of praise
Has laid me to my silent rest

The wreath upon my chest will wither
And farewell candles be extinguished

I was your father, son and brother
A noble man and nameless stranger
My blood now feeds the earth below
My spirit howls in Northern storms

In darkness, fear is creeping from my tomb
The writhes with swords there lurk in gloom
And songs of mourning wont cease soonâ¦
