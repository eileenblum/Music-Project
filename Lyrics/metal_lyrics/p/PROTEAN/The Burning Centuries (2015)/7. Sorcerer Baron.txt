[Music: J. KrivÄns lyrics: E. Vizla]

He is riding again, the devil's apprentice
Upon his black stallion, the mad sorcerer lord!
His hand holds the whip, his voice mocking us
Our suffering grows, our land weeps of his works

The lord of our land has made a pact with!
a pact with the devil himself!
Through evil magic his power is strong,
everyone fears him!

Our sweat and blood he drinks as thirsty mad dog
Beating and enslaving us, trading with our souls
His wealth is great, gained by means unholy and evil
Locked away in secret chambers beneath his walls

The lord of our land has made a pact with
a pact with the devil himself!
Torture and death awaits those who rebel,
everyone hates him!

No good death awaits you, no peace in the afterlife
As you made us suffer, you now will suffer forever!
Those who serve demons will be devoured by them
Those who drink blood, in blood will be drowned!

Your screams of death will roar from your castle
The sorcerer's agony is the most horrible torture
Your ghost will haunt the halls of your home
To bring fear to the living on dark Autumn nights

The lord of our land has made a pact with
a pact with the devil himself!
Torture and death awaits those who rebel,
everyone hates him!

We will drive an iron spike through your possessed heart!
Our prayers and curses will burn and prevail against you!

Your accursed head will rest between your feet
Your coffin we bind in strong copper chains!

Bring the word to the people,
the vengeance has come
The lord of our land has been taken
to hell by the devil
