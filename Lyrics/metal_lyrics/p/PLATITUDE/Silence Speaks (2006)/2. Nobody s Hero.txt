I know that you doubt me, but I'm not who you think I am
No one believers me 'cause I am myself
Often, I dream away, but there are limits
To all I've seen in my dreams

I'm standing right between good and bad
I can not see what's right or wrong!

No one can see me, I'm nobody hero...

Sometimes just before evening time
I dream away to my hidden happiness

I'm standing right between good and bad
I cannot see what's right or wrong!

No one can see me, I'm nobody's here...
No one believes me, I'm nobody's hero
