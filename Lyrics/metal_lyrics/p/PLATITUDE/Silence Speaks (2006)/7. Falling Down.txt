Gazing eyes, lost in my mind
Frightening visions of my past

Feeling down, feeling lost
Feeling like I'm going down... that is all I can see
I got lost in a swirl. I was taken by the wind...
Now I'm falling away, from you...

Someday, wish that I'll see the light
Get reminded of the feelings we had - they meant all!
Sometimes, I remember your torch
I was falling fast and I didn't land, until now!

Sleepless nights, can't find myself anymore
What is this world will do better without me?
Is it worth the journey? Will I fall again?
No one stands beside me, no one will catch me!

Feeling down, feeling lost
Feeling like I'm going down... that is all I can see
I got lost in a swirl. I was taken by the wind...
Now I'm falling away, from you...
