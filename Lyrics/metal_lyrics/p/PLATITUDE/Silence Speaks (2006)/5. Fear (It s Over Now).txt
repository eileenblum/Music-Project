(2:am)
Where I am heading? Is this the end of my days?
Too much to take... my conscience is failing me
Why can't I see? What can I do? Tell me what's true

I'm building dreams on lies
Castles in the sand
Kill the ones who cares on my own demand

(3:am)
It's coming back!
The feelings I thought disappeared...
They're all coming back!

It's over now... don't look into my eyes!
It's over now... my eyes of betrayal!
It's over now... broken pieces left!
It's over now... of me and my life!

This hell I wander. Can't seem to break out this
Spell that I'm under... don't ask me why!
The guilt is on me. The sentence of solitude
Took me away... away from you all

I'm building dreams on lies
Castles in the sand

It's over now... don't look into my eyes!
It's over now... my eyes of betrayal!
It's over now... broken pieces left!
It's over now... of me and my life!

(4:am)
The wounds in my soul has taken control of my freedom
Blackened eyes... only fools would cry for help!
No one ever would - could I...?
