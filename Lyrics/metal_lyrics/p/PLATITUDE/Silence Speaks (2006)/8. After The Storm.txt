I can't believe that you have decided to move on...
Loneliness, emptiness - trapped within me!

Not me! No more! The tears beneath your eyes, will be
Falling for someone your heart can't recognize

But when the storm is over, I will be waiting for you
I'm always too late. Trapped within you...

Stand alone - got time for myself. Wish that I had not...
Everything I do is up to me
But alone, how can I succeed?
I'm crying!

Not me! No more! The tears beneath your eyes, will be
Falling for someone your heart can't recognize

But when the storm is over, I will be waiting for you
I'm always too late.

But when the storm is over, I will be waiting for you
I'm always too late.
