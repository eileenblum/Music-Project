The roll of the dice has just begun
You're thinking your life is over
Believe me I don't care at all
Tomorrow is far away...

Don't be afraid - it's alright
I'm not holding back anymore...
Don't be afraid - hold on tight!
Don't let them touch your soul!

One of these days, it all comes back
Back to your head, a sense of pain!

Some people believe
Some people grieve
Filling their minds with sorrow
Look at yourself, down on the ground
You're still on the run!

Don't be afraid - it's alright
I'm not holding back anymore...
Don't be afraid - hold on tight!
Don't let them touch your soul!
