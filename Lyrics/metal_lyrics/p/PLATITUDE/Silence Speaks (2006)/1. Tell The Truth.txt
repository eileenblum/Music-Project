I see questions in the sky...
Why are we pretending?
Why is mankind always blind

So far... from truth... when we are... the same kind!

Tell the truth! Tell me now, I'm waiting!
Tell me! I will tell no one...

It takes human diversity to solve the biggest quest of all
Is that to form up and fight for things that we believe in?

So near... we're close to... the end of mankind!

Tell the truth! Tell me now, I'm waiting!
Tell me! I will tell no one...

There is something in the air tonight, passing by
Something strange, something else, than the truth

Were lost... but there now...
Today, we'll die here!
