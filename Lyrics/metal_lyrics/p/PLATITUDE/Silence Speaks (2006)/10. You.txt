Walking through the park in the never ending rain
Who's' behind your back? Your identity down the drain
When it all comes down, anybody is anyone else...
Take some time to think. You're all caught in a plan
Leave the stupid trend and don't keep running in the sand
Get some self esteem and find out that you are unique!
Just like everyone else!

Why is it like this? Wake up! What is happening to us?
Everyone's acting like if they were the same and
Why does no one stand up to put an end to this game?
Cause we're never the same! No one's the same!
Mankind biggest shame!

Some believe in beings 'cause they need someone to blame
Some will search inside themselves and see the human game
Think by yourself... you have a mind of your own!
Politics are grinding off our personalities
Stand up to their needs
Dump further creativities
Tell them to go fuck themselves
The keyword is inside yourself! Individuality!

Why is it like this? Wake up! What is happening to us?
Everyone's acting like if they were the same and
Why does no one stand up to put an end to this game?
Cause we're never the same! No one's the same!
Mankind biggest shame!

Make your dreams come true... you are yourself...
Don't let no one control your mind
There is no one of your own kind
The rest is a lie!
Don't let your life pass by!
