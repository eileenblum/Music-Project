In my dreams, I can see a new world appear
Things we never would imagine occur - they are now reality

Is this the end of the journey? (out of control)
Will we see a new day rise?

Where do we go from here?
When silence speaks louder than words?
Where do we go now?
When silence speaks louder than...

Mankind can't break the nature's law, said a man who lost it all
Nature's reconstruction is on the way

Is this the end of the journey? (out of control)
Will we see a new day rise?

Where do we go from here?
When silence speaks louder than words?
Where do we go now?
When silence speaks louder than...

Now I can see a new world spinning round
It's perfectly clean
Who knew that mankind didn't fit heaven?
