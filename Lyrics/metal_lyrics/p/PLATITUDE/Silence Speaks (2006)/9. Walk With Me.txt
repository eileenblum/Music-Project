When everyone changes beyond recognition everywhere
You where standing there in my darkest hour
Walking this lane, I don't know where it leads me to
But with you I will get by

If you fear sometimes that life will let you drown
Just turn your face to me, I won't let you down

I'm watching the sky at night and heading for a fall
But I know, you're always there to catch me!

I know you will be there, next to me!

Walk! With! Me! Into the fire!
Walk! With! Me! I need you beside me tonight!
Walk! With! Me! Into the fire!

I'm thinking about my life and wonder what went wrong
All the hours pass me by
Taking it all too hard, but sometimes you can't help yourself
Turn yourself to me again!

If you fear sometimes that life will let you drown
Just turn your face to me, I won't let you down

Walk! With! Me! Into the fire!
Walk! With! Me! I need you beside me tonight!
Walk! With! Me! Into the fire!

You're my shelter...

Walk! With! Me! Into the fire!
Walk! With! Me! I need you beside me tonight!
