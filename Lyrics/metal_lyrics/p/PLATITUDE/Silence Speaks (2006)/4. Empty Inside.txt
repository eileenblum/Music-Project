In this lonely world, in this nick of time
Locked inside and still can't find a way out
I am lost for words - why do I still care?
When no one seems to bother anyway...

Frustration! No wonder! I feel like going under!
Obsession! No question! When will I learn my lesson?

Torn apart. Empty heart. Take these chains off me!
Empty heart, torn apart. Let me live!

In another world, in another time
Maybe I could see, but now I'm blind
I am longing for a piece of mind again
Please... can you help me out, my friend?

So lonely... abandoned! I stand alone and frightened...
I'm shaking, I'm stranded! To darkness I am bounded!

Torn apart. Empty heart. Take these chains off me!
Empty heart, torn apart. Let me live!

I'm shaking, I'm stranded! To darkness I am bounded!
