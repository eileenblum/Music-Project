I don't know what I am feeling
My heart is one messed up chamber
I knkow it truly is over
You did the right thing the wrong way

When will I be bree of the feelings
That I still have for you, my baby

I can't make myself hate you
Even though you have me
More than I've ever known
I still love you baby!

I would not have worked at all

You can't even tell me you're sorry
You lack of empathy, as always!

I can't make myself hate you
I still love you baby!

[Solo]

When will I be free of the feelings
That I still have for you my baby

I can't make myself hate you
Even though you have me
More than I've ever known

When will i be free of the feelings
That I still have for you baby...
