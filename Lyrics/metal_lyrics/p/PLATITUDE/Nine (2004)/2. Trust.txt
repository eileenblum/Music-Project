Once upon a life
I'm still trying to find
So what's left to do?
Can you tell me why?

Love is all need
Trust me I will never let you down!
Trying to move on
I reach out but noone's there for me!

Lies are feeding lies
This i know for sure
But how can this become?
When you and I are one?

Love is all need!
Trust me I will never let you down!
Trying to move on
I reach out but noone's there for me!

[Solo]

Fate is in my hands
Even on my own
I won't understand
I guess time will show

Love is all need
Trust me I will never let you down!
Trying to move on
I reach out but noone's there for me!

No...
