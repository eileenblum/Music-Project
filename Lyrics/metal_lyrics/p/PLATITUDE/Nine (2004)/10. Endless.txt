Welcome in, grab a chair
How may we use you today?
Let my will set the way!
Your synthetic brain will obey!

So you want  revolution?
You have no mind of your own!
I am your ruling anonymous
The puppet-mastering pimp

You are too lazy
To do something else with your life!
Don't give in! Don't give in!

There aint no way you can win this!
You're just a programmed reciever!
You're all expendable nobodies
You have to be a believer!

The future aint what it used to be
Or has it always been the same?

So don't give up, don't give in
You've got to rule your own life!
Stop sucking up to the power!
Together you might win this fight

The future aint what is used to be.
Or has it always been the same?
The future aint what is used to be.
Or has it always been the same?

[Solo]
