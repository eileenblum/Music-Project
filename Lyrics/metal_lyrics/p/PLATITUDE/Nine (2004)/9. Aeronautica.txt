Face your dreams
Progress thru' your life
Without any guidance from what you believe
The stars and the sky

Universe, please open up for my life!
I need some guidance to save my own time
It's getting late!

Soaring thru' the unknown
Passing stars and skies far beoynd
Soaring thru' the unknown
Passing stars and skies far beoynd

Turn the page
What's left of your life is the soul
A master's remains, his left over dust
in the wind

Universe, please open up for my life
I need some guidance to save my own time
It's getting late!
Soaring thru' the unknown
Passing stars and skies far beoynd
Soaring thru' the unknown
Passing stars and skies far beoynd

[Solo]

Soaring thru' the unknown
Passing stars and skies far beoynd
Soaring thru' the unknown
Passing stars and skies far beoynd
