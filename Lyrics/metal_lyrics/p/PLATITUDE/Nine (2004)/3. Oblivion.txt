I am trying to comprehend
My inner worries and peoples behaviour
It doesn't make sense at all
It seems like there's  no catch

I'm wasting my precious time
On giant riddles with no solution

Sometimes
I think it's better not to care
Turn your back away
Sometimes
Let your worries fall into oblivion

Maybe one night forget
To live in a decent life in the haze of worries
I've never been much for depressing
Endings in the stories I've read

It's up to myself
To win the princess and halvf of the kingdom
I'll feed my revolution
with my utmost will to live

Sometimes
I think it's better not to care
Turn your back away
Sometimes
Let your worries fall into oblivion

[Solo]

Sometimes
I think it's better not to care
Turn your back away
Sometimes
Let your worries fall into oblivion
