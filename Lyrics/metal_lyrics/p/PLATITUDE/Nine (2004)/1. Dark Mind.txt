I'm laying a puzzle in my head.
But the pieces are created by me
Sometimes I wish the activity was dead.
Too many hours alone.

You say you love me and i know
I know it's true.
But my dark mind, makes up it's own truth
It gives me fragments.
Of something I might want to see.

The trust invested is in danger.
but only because of me!
My paranoid mind is being strong
I am betraying myself

My dark mind gives me fragments.
Of something I don't want to see.
But deep down I know
That it's just lies!

My dark mind
In my dark mind
In my dark my, yeeeaaah

[Solo]

My dark mind
In my mind
My dark mind is changing

I have hit the wall, what can I do?
Which will be the weapons
To kill my own dark mind.
