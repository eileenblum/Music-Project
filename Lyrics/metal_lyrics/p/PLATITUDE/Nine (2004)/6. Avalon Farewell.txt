So, this is the way it all should be?
When you're lost inside this world
Nothing seems to be, no
When madness calls you by your name
Will you answer
Would you fall into it's hands?

I can see horizons in places never found
I'm watching myself being carried away with time

Avalon - slipping away, I'm dreaming
Avalon - can't keep this heart from beating
Avalon - slipping away, I'm dreaming
Avalon - can't keep this heart fom beating.

It's an illusion
Could it be an illusion

Now, this is the end as we would know
But not for me, I'm still alive - still alive
So far away from home
The place I knew, the home is in your arms

Fading black horizons, sunset is above
When all faith is gone I'm my only God

Avalon - slipping away, I'm dreaming
Avalon - can't keep this heart from beating

We're all gone mad
The feelings we had
Suddenly seems gone
Help me now
'Cause I want to come home
Avalon!

[Solo]

Avalon - slipping away, I'm dreaming
Avalon - can't keep this heart from beating
Avalon - slipping away, I'm dreaming
Avalon - can't keep this heart fom beating.

Oh, I'm alone in this hell...
