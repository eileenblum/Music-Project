My world is coming to an end
I'm remembering the times that've past
When mankind put faith in:
Love - Honesty - Empathy
When no life was worth more than another

Those halcyon days are gone
The love is gone
Those halcyon days are gone
What happened to happiness?
Those halcyon days are gone
Hate all over the world
Those halcyon days are gone
I'm dreaming away

Someday I hope they'll understand
That our suffering
Has only been breeding from
Hate - Greed - Selfishnes
Turn back now before it's too late

The halcyon days are gone
Those halcyon days are gone
What happened to happiness and love?
Those halcyon days are gone
I'm dreaming of the fire!
Those halcyon days are gone
I hope it's not to late

[Solo]

Those halcyon days are gone
Dream away, the love has gone away
Those halcyon days are gone
Where is the love
I can't make it seem to last
Those halcyon days are gone
Hate all over the world
Those halcyon days are gone
Greed was spreading lika a disease
