I'm thrown around in my mind, in my head
Voices of wonder
Whispering slightly inside my brain
That time's running fast!

So low my life turned out to be, 
I'm closin' out my fantasy
Possessed by the darkness to come
I see the future's stars are here

Ans so I close my mind's door.
Letting the future take control
I dream of a world beyond mankind
that surrounds us all

How could my life turn out so wrong
I was closing out my fantasy
Possessed by invisible forces
The starlight above me is right here

I'm puzzled by questions
That's roaming my mind
There's somehow no answer
Why can't it be logic?
It's itching my brain! A livin' disease

So low my life turned out to be
I'm closin' out my fantasy
Possessed by the darkness to come
I see the future's stars are here

And so I close my mind's door
Letting the future take control
I dream of a world beyond mankind
That surrounds us all

[Solo]

And so I close my mind's door
Letting the future take control
I dream of a world beyond mankind
that surrounds us all...
