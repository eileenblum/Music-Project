You cried out. This is what I'm proposing.
Please stay with me. I'm yours forever.

This is your life, just one try.
No one will live forever.
Let it be done, 'cause tomorrow you're gone.

Just don't change your mind for me my love.
Don't live in lies for me, my love.

If this is love, we're committed forever.
Signs from above. Will get us nowhere.

This is your life, just one try.
No one will live forever.
We will be one, 'cause tomorrow you're gone.

Just don't change your mind for me my love.
Don't live lie for me, my love.

[SOLO]

Please tell me the truth, before it's too late.
You are my hope. Please kill my hate.

This is your life, just one try.
No one will live forever.
Let it be done, 'cause tomorrow you're gone.

Don't change your mind for me my love.
Don't live in lies for me, my love.

[SOLO]
