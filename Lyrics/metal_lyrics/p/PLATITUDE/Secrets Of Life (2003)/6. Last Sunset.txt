My end of time will come soon. So they say.
My time is running up. My final play.
I've shed some tears, but for no use.
Physical dead, but my soul you'll abuse.

You try to kill me.
I'll never die.

Time is running, life slips away.
Vengeance is nearing, face the truth.

What can I do, I've been locked up since long.
I'm innocent, this is totally wrong.
Voices I hear are complaints of my crime.
You are all fools, don't waste your time.

You cry for vengeace.
I know the truth.

Time is running, life slips away.
Vengeance is nearing, face the truth.

[SOLO]

I'm not afraid of your mind-breaking game.
Nor for the death angel's furious flame.
Voices I hear are complaints of my crime.
You are all fools, don't waste your time.

You try to kill me.
I'll never die.

Time is running, life slips away.
Vengeance is nearing, face the truth.
