Darkness is surrounding.
The air is filled with screams.
There's a chance that you will die
'Cause this is not a dream
The darkness if this world is clearer when it rains.
But the mystic lights that bring out the hope won't
Shine in vain.

It's a hopeless fire that burns in the night.
Don't call me a liar.
I'm where darkness rules.

Blood was shed and dreams were crushed. Heaven was falling.
Magic tales of happiness, no longer told.

It's a hopeless fire that burns in the night.
Don't call me a liar.
I'm where darkness rules.

It's a magic mirror that fooled friends i knew.
Don't try to deny it.
Just look through its glass.

[SOLO]

Gight with soul and you will see, the dark surrenders.
Like a bird up in the tree, it flies away.
You know knowledge is the key to stay alive.
Those magic, raining tears won't help you.
If you die.

It's a hopeless fire that burns in the night.
Don't call me a liar.
I'm where darkness rules.
