I'm standing alone in a dark cold room.
Without you in my arms.
How could you turn away from me?
You tear my heart apart.

My life was a lie before I met you.
A joke as you would say.
Believe in me, I am trying to make it better.

The love we had is hidden in your soul.
A place I want to be.

I'd die here.
I'm dying here

So many ways to fall out of love
To step into the trap
Where are you now, 'cause I need you so?
No place on the map

My life was a lie before I met you.
A joke as you would say.
Believe in me, I am trying to make it better.

[Bridge:]
The love we had is hidden in your soul.
A place I want to be.

I'd die here.
I'm dying here

[SOLO]

I'd die here.
I'm dying here.
