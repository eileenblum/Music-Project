You've been wandering thru'  your life
Without a broubled mind.
Waiting for a revelation. But goodness made you blind.

I see a burning flame.
It glows like the faces of the failed, when the night is falling.

You have never turned around to face the blackened skies.
Ages of deception will haunt you. You'll sacrafice.

I see a living hope.
I wonder if this will wake you up. From that evil...

...Nightmare...Nightmare...

You will wreath in fortune till that day wyour time will end.
Then your burning soul will be destroyed by evil.

I see a living hope.
I wonder if this will wake you up. From that evil...

...Nightmare...Nightmare...

[SOLO]

I see a burning flame.
It glows like the faces of the failed, when the night is falling.

...Nightmare...Nightmare...

You'll wake up from your nightmare.
Face the devil - look him in the eyes.
Your time will end.
