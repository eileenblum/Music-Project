The night was cold and gray. The night you turned away.
The love lost that night, won't leave a hope in sight.

Today I realize. You turned my heart to ice.
The cold that sticks in me is not that heavenly.

You said I hurt you so, that I just couldn't stay.
Believe me, I would never be that way.

You made me see that life is not a misery.
Leading nowhere.
You just turned away from me.
Away from something that was meant to be.
We were dreaming.

I saw our last chance die. It happened, I wonder why.
Could  our love disappear? It's far away I fear.

Love's like a dream for some.
Althought it marks you when it fades away.

You made me see that life is not a misery.
Leading nowhere.
You just turned away from me.
Away from something that was meant to be.
We were dreaming.

[SOLO]

You made me see that life is not a misery.
Leading nowhere.
You just turned away from me.
Away from something that was meant to be.
We were dreaming.
