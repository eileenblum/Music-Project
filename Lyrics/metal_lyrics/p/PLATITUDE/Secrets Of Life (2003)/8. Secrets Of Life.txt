In ancient times, this world startedto.
Create itself from an empty piece of nothingness

This makes no sense to our minds.
We have no clue to this mystery.

We'll never understand.
The secrets of life.
So I'll just have to find my own way.

We got our lives from the sun, and down here.
Forests and lakes and the virtue of our Mother Earth.

Out of the sky the rain fall down.
To where it once had been before.

We'll never understand.
The secrets of life.
So I'll just have to find my own way.

[SOLO]

Follow yoursteps and you'll find, who you are.
The unknown ways are inside your mind. Open it!

Through burning mist I'll see your world.
It is so strange and yet so divine.

We'll never understand.
The secrets of life.
So I'll just have to find my own way.
That's the secret of life.
The secrets of life.
