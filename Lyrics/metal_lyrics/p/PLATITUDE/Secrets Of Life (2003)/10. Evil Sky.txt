Standing here, out in the dark.
No sign of Heaven.
All the hope has dissapeared.
Burned up in flames.

The rain is pouring down.
Washing me, free from sin.
No one will ever know.

There is no hope, and death is closing up.
I'll fight until I drop.
I'll turn away, to face the evil sky.
T'll stand there petrified

My body is as cold as ice.
I start to shiver.
Far away from Paradice.
Is where I am.

The rain is pouring down.
Washing me, free from sin.
No one will ever know.

There is no hope, and death is closing up.
I'll fight until I drop.
I'll turn away, to face the evil sky.
I'll stand there petrified

[SOLO]

The rain is pouring down.
Washing me, free from sin.
No one will ever know.

There is no hope, and death is closing up.
I'll fight until I drop.
I'll turn away, to face the evil sky.
I'll stand there petrified
