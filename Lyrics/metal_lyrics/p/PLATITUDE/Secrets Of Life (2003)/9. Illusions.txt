You're lost inside yourself.
Trying to find out.
Why am I chainedin misery?

I'm seeking wisdom.
'Cause I know knowledge is the key.
The key to open our hearts to see what there's to be.

I search my mind.
Who's been there?
Who stole my thoughts?
I live in lies.

Don't try to change my mind
Don't try to change my mind

Fading lights surround my head.
I'm getting weary.
Are these illusions maybe real?

I'm seeking wisdom, 
'Cause I know knowledge is the key.
The key to open our mind to see that there's to be.

I search my mind.
Who's been there?
Who stole my thoughts?
I live in lies.

Don't try to change my mind
Don't try to change my mind

[SOLO]

I search my mind.
Who's been there?
Who stole my thoughts?
I live in lies.

Don't try to change my mind.
Never try to...
Don't try to change my mind.
