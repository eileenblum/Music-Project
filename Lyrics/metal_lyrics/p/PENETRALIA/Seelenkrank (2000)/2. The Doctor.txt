Good morning, I'm your doctor
Dr. Oste is my name
I appreciate your coming
To play my wicked games

No need to be frightened
Calm down and lay to rest
Come on let's see what drugs we have
Yeah - alcohol's the best

Now nurse where's my scalpel
Give it - will you please?
Patient's still in conscience
Anyway - I can't ease the pain

A little cut right here
Another cut down there

How I love them screaming
Like little kids in fear

Yeah I'm Dr. Oste
Surgery's my game
Cruelty was my mother
Everytime I do the same

Here is the nervus opticus
Cut it - will you nurse
Now give that slimy eye to me
I'll put it in a glass

Don't want your flesh
I just want your eye
Gimme eyes
But I won't take both
Just one
Cause I'd like you to see
My sofisticated art

How d'you like it
Disfigured faces are beautiful I think
Say you like it
I want you to say it .
