Illdisposed - rotten brain
Talking mental bullshit - gone insane

Disgored by mother nature - can't you feel the shame
Little dumb bastards - all of you just the same

Narrow minded idiots - you are Hitler's whores
Ridiculous, all of your kind - that's what I call
A total eclipse of the mind.

Fuck you - Bastards
Come down - just a piece of shit
Ain't worth it

None of you will ever fool me
Cause I see things you'll never find
Just let me show you
The total eclipse of your mind

Perhaps you call me untrue - and that's allright with me
Bay all the things you stand for
Just sound ridiculous to me

Narrow minded idiots - I see things you'll never find
Just let me show you - the total eclipse of your mind

Bastards - I'm just not the thing
You wanna see in me - Fuck

Bastards.
