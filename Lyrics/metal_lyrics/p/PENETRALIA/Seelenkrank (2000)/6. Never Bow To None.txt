Are you really satisfied
Doing the things they tell
All their morals and ideologies
Just ways to keep you calm

No way anyway
Never bow to none

Spit forth the hypocrit
Deny the essence of their life
Even more to do, more to find
Just take care or you'll go blind

Do what you want
Shall be the only rule
I'll show you life
You'll be my tool
