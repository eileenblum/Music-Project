Swimming in a cold stream of blood
Clothing is getting heavier,
Soaped with the sap of life.
Unable to find a stand or grip,
No power to move further,
Ready to die in these stinky floods.

Drink or drown, little Jester.
Drink or drown!!

I can see pictures of rape,
Naked violence passing my mind.
Hatred accelerates the heartbeat
To the speed of wardrums,
Calling for Armageddon.

Drink or drown, little Jester.
Drink or drown!!

There is sin, Jester, there are sinners.
Be god's revenge, slash them, where they stand.
Show them the thruth of god's word:
"(An) Eye for an eye!"
Be the shining sword of justice.

Drink don't drown, little Jester.
Drink don't drown!!
