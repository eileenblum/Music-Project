Narrow minded herds, self-loving and absorbed
Welcoming the plague, with barbed tainted flags
Standing all alone no longer is your own
Heed this dying tone, already carved in stone

With halos of iron, spread your wings of trust

The rules that you enact are quarreled with your facts
The syndromes you endorse are kicking your dead horse
Your movements had been raped by day jobs and red tapes
And nihility prevailed between their fingernails

The waves will wash ashore
What your shameful bliss has done against all odds
Give in to fear and fall before
The consequences gods

Beg to differ where no difference can be spared
Embrace with open arms the scent of smoking guns
Cry out from the top of your collapsing lungs
How the world has turned its back on you and smiled

Renounce your false-golden dreams
Set fire to the ideals once stood proud
Tear down the walls, lit (sic) up the consensus
Rise from those boundaries unbowed

Shatter your glass prison
Regrets, you'll have none
To progress is to shed skin
Let bygones be bygones

Make amends with your true nature
Do not submit to the voice of the old
Shed your true individual light
Unto this vacant world
