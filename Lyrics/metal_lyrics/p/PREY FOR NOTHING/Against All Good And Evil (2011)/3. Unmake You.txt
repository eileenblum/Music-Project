A storm is coming to flood the gate
But it won't break through my walls
The servants rise to overthrow their kings
And miserable they'll fall

So it comes to pass
Your true face is shown at last
The perfect opportunity to fail

There will be no turning back
Once the table will be set
How easily you turn friends to foes
To me you never were a threat

Don't make me unmake you
Your suffering has only just begun

So it comes to pass
Your disposition turns to dust
I'll compromise the future
To forget this perfect past
