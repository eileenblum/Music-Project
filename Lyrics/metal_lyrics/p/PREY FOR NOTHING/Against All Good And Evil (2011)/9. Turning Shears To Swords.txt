This has gone far enough
The vacuity of what you stood for
Your turbid stand, dried out and hanged
And we were those who kicked the trapdoor

Your perpetual stench reeks out from the morals you dissolved
You stand as a fact that even the rats can evolve
Embody the old, the layers down under, grown fat and obese
Let tranquility be torn asunder as we bring down the beast

Odious decadence
I'm killing your tune, chord by chord
Revoking this stalemate
As we're turning shears into swords

Be it your disdain
For what you thought that will not strive
Like the enemy you tried to tame
We'll prove we're very much alive

No parental guidance - just musical world of hurt
Your deaf ears will finally hear our words
Throwing the wrench in the gears of industrial art
Let this song turn your shears to swors
