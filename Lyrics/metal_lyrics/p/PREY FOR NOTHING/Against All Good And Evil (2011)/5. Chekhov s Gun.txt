From the start / to the end / of this road
Stand aside / petrified / from this fraud
All these lies / cold as ice / sacrificed
Filicide

You will break / on the stake / one more take,
Set the stage / tear a page / untamed rage,
Move in stealth / hold their breath / drowned in bath
Dreams of death

One by one we all fall in despair and suffering
None of us have such a cross to bear upon the screen

Devil dance / on the chance / to find life
Plead the fifth / spitting filth / provoke strife
On the air / wild affair / no one cared
Eat your young

Set all your / stories straight / for the judge
Misconception of hate / tense and grudge
Foul deeds / plant the seeds / pleading kids
Flooded lungs

You will burn on the altar for your pointless parade
For the sins of our fathers made our teeth set on edge
An unnatural selection - let loose the wolves
Chekhov's gun, locked &amp; loaded, is the purest of proofs

Innocent children lured by their parents, like prey taking bait
And justice is coming, as always, a little too late
