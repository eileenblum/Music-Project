Miscalculated destiny
Driven to its end
Reclaiming Ahab's retribution
On this white whale world of man

This Gordian knot was cut in silence
Confined in this mortal shell
I swear to none of these allegiances
The arrow turn, the sword rebel

No validity
No purpose found above
Moral event horizon has been passed
Siphon divinity
Defy both hate and love
Stand against them all and watch the world collapse

Serene I fought angelic monsters
To this deviant bliss
There's nothing staring back at me
For I am the abyss
