How can you define a man,
If not by the taste of his own words
And as long as life might span
We reign upon this faux enclosed
Destiny, I laugh at thee
Your reign of terror soon to pass
I now declare thy chains removed
This broken oath benign the past

It comes as no surprise
Like biting bullets, grinding teeth
Your called reclusion lingering
A sliced promise to a sliced wrist

These loathing smiles I will delete
Your grudging grasp now obsolete
Torn apart beneath the unlearnt history
Bombardment of these past mistakes
I light a match to your oily wake
Treachery, sweet treachery

An endless line of failure stands
In front of what you comprehend
Majestic impotence of acts
Next to the trust you seem to lack

Like mother that forsakes her son
In a trash can down the street
A crime that cannot be undone
Atrocious vow, splendent defeat

Condemned the partners you betrayed
In your smothering serenade
Breathing just this foul adultery
To put an end to your charade
Sever the ties with a scorning blade
Treachery, of sweet treachery
