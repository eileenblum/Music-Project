Picking the wound with the hands of a healer
That has gone sour in years
Insight entombed, till the fog will get clearer
With searing comes the fear

An overcoming urge
To default, to obtain
The latest power surge
Of a little change in plans

Shudder to think of the consequences
Of this angry-filtered letting go
Like the moth to the flame I'm attracted
To the only path that I know

A repeated answer to the mundane ordeal
Which comes from a man who can't tell what is real?
A personal struggle, euphoria no longer applies
"This is my final relapse" he had sworn to the lie

A man with no future will ask
What is right, what is wrong?
Cannot foresee the coming disaster
The same sickening old song
