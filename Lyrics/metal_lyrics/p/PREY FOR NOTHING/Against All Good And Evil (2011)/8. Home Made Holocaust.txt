I've grown sick and tired from what mankind can offer me
I learned to know that I'm better than anyone I'll ever meet
My parents thought that I'm a beacon of despair
And still they grant me freedom to accomplish my malign affairs

A secret tyrant
Assume control
Of earth's entire providence
With no one watching
Imminent fall
Degenerated brilliance

I find social interactions nothing but a waste of time
The usage of my resources feels just like a tactical sublime
I couldn't care less for your whimpering faÃ§ade
I've trained a whole lifetime to stand against you and your odds

Authentic genius
Caprices' crown
An outcast of misbegotten deeds
With unclear reason
Vague shaded bounds
Can't trust the hand that feeds

All fair in love and war, and you'll get no love from me
Pacifists can't settle scores,
Dare to walk this road and see
Shadow of my former self, a dry and empty crust
Spreading judgement from mom's basement, homemade holocaust

Duct-taped philosophies tie another node
I'm armed to my teeth as my master-plan unfolds
Behavior is a riddle scarring me with doubt
And what is this compassion that you talk about

A deadly password
Rmeoved with ease
Fortifications broken down
Keep pressing forward
The end complete
A kid with a hundred atom bombs
