Welcome to your future crash site
Where old tenets engulf the modern world
Let vagaries grow in hundreds
Let your cogitation deterred

Deciphering the signal
Of mankind's last resort
A linguistic overtone
Where dreams make science rot
Deciphering the signal
Unchanged neccessity
Replace the code of conduct
With new bigotry

Psychological temples and clerics of reason
Intelligence flowing like lives shred in crimson
Benevolent murder of critical thinking
As personalities led to the brink of extinction

This behavioral scripture is illusive at best
Decrepit answer of whims, desires and zests
Despicable structure that's raising new prophets
Root out this ailing wry concept
