Wet wires circled around your neck
Sewn into the vision you forsake
And as you clear the fog around me
You'll find a new obscurity

A requiem for the initiative
A charge to keep against all which is offensive
Upgrading amok, as luxuries breed
Technological fumble in immortal speed

A vow of obedience is programmed in a card
I play the last of options, and the final note is hard
The random lights and cryptic writing spell the coming end
Of all that is humane, and what you'll never understand

By the future you once own
Stolen by the neon pantheon
You've divided and you conquered well
Led every single brain to fail

The engines of comfort moan with a sigh
As another victim falls prey to their lie
Unreachable memories of days long past
In a giant machine never built to last
