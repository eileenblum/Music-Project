I know now more than ever
that everything I've done was meant to be,
it comes as warmth and painted silver,
a toss to our simplicity

Shatter the days of old
and turn your journal's pages slowly
an era is come to an end,
an evident to yours presence only

An emotional gambit,
a game to play and war to win,
every battle won we still feel we lost it,
our personal agendas glowing thin

Through the walls of dejection
I found myself a Breach
Hell hath no fury as the wounded wolves,
four hands grasp granting swifter slight of moves

Where others seem blurry
and they have no effect anymore
you told me a change was coming
and I embraced it without sores

The colder my hands will grow
the stronger my shoulder will be

An emotional gambit,
a game to play and war to win,
every battle won we still feel we lost it,
our personal agendas glowing thin

Through the walls of dejection
I found myself a Breach
Hell hath no fury as the wounded wolves,
four hands grasp granting swifter slight of moves
