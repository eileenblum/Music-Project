Bright star of foreign man,
your lies are all forgotten well
from crooked smile you draw a plan
of how to chime the Jewish knell

I am caught inside illusion of an illiterate mind,
I'll cut my easy way out, force the foresight to bleed wine
Since God created hatred, Since Able cried to Cane
we've become the tools to our own demonic plans

Abomination of your soul
has granted life to Dead Man's Dream
and through your sewn shut eyes
you'll watch the dying of my sins

Sins are all told quick,
our annals repeat themselves again,
we only taught by stones and sticks,
indeed, the hardest way we learn

I am caught inside illusion of an illiterate mind,
I'll cut my easy way out, force the foresight to bleed wine
Since God created hatred, Since Able cried to Cane
we've become the tools to our own demonic plans

Abomination of your soul
has granted life to Dead Man's Dream
and through your sewn shut eyes
you'll watch the dying of my sins

Between the Reichstag and the temples laid to rest
where the serpents slowly rebuild again their nests

Abomination of your soul
has granted life to Dead Man's Dream,
an Inspiration born of hate,
too many years have sealed its fate
