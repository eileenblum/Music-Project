And at that night I came to cross my stare with fear,
behind her glassy eyes I noticed you, my dear

Just a few days ago I was petrified by grief
but now I see eternal comfort, a sanctified relief

Don't let the mourning break your will,
walk to the bereavement and prevail

Without fear
but with knowledge
I will steer my mind
to acknowledge

Torn from the past
to become a distant future,
manipulate the facts
to attach romantic suture

Instead of granting birthright to my kindred
I shed my prudence and Bestowed it Upon The Void

Willow of misfortune mark my way,
blink of an eye between your cradles to your graves

Without fear
but with knowledge
I will steer my mind
to acknowledge
