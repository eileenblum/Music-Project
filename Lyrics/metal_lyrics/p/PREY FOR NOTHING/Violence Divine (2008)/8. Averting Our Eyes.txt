I'm but a simple man
who fell as victim to the circumstances,
I was given with a shameful stain
to decorate my clear nuances

Do not treat on me, girl,
I was merely just a fiction,
I got nothing more to sell
for your selfish prediction

A dagger in the dark
worth dozens swords at dawn,
how can you ask forgiveness
when you can barely atone?

With every lie, your smile suffice
Averting Our Eyes, Averting Our Eyes
did you believe I am not that wise?
Averting Our Eyes, Averting Our Eyes

A pestilence of thoughts,
profanity so pure,
I saw from a far that you crave for scars
but I'm not the one to scar you

A dismal past and future
that you put down to display,
how everyone molested you,
even God shined you away

I'm but a simple man
but even I hold some few dirty tricks
and with my back against the wall
you can surely use a little fix

I've gone against your wills,
I've turn the other chick,
this old dog has finally
learn a damn new trick

With every lie, your smile suffice
Averting Our Eyes, Averting Our Eyes
did you believe I am not that wise?
Averting Our Eyes, Averting Our Eyes
