Can you forgive your God for granting you your shape?
Barely reached adulthood, you took too many vicious steps
it seems like every moment passing by time runs against you, 
a decadence so evident for this generation's point of view

Disintegration, figures twisted version, 
a hole is carved inside the belly of the beast
Primal and ill-fated, all are infected, 
too many walked the road, awaiting their defeat

Behind every smiling face you hide disgusted sheen 
with loathing melodies you're littering your skin
like children play with hand grenades, like peaceful war within 
the fuse is running short of time and so does your disgraceful kin

And in the end 
your Cowardice will grant your fall, 
you know that in the end 
that Cowardice is in you all

Shimmering mire found in every ivory tower, 
a graceful force of terror in every contact lens
Photography, pornography, success will taste your sour, 
the chrome folios draw your image completely out of sense

And in the end 
your Cowardice will grant your fall, 
you know that in the end 
that Cowardice is in you all

Cowardice
