Becoming wrath, ignore placidity,
a taste of faith is earned
A monstrous passage is revealed
that leads to a world unknown

Icons will crumble,
brush the dust of illicit books,
how grave will be your fumble
when you dare not to overlook

Over the human panorama
of destructive power-play,
behind the velvet words of drama,
the iron rules will choke the day

I am The Maw, my mission's clear,
I devour everything I see
Emotions swallowed, my heartstrings torn,
I am the great of all conspiracies

Revenants of life, I warn thee
I am all that you fear,
growing inside a tiny office,
the worst of nightmare now appear

Now you will witness the becoming
the up and coming end of days,
the latest fashion of destruction
is but a man with hunger

Disaster strikes your cities,
the hungry one now stands,
I take the Violence you throw against me
and respond with crushing hand

Corrupted mind, distorted bowls,
a cannibal of thoughts,
you can barely grasp the mind work
of this glutton Juggernaut
