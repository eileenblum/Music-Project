Touching the essence, a blasphemy's born,
why do we keep on trying when lives are torn?
In times of poverty we must remember that
there are no cues above only within the heart

Shade the future so no light find its way
to clarify the actuality

Wherever you look it will clench your sight,
a design so spiteful inverting what's right
To a stranger a lark, for the locals a war,
collapse the foundation like never before

There will be no excuse
for the path that we choose,
smite the foul from the lungs of our breed

How could we come this far to a place that all forgotten,
our fate hath bound us here to stand as one again,
a million years old legacy cannot be crooked by men,
don't let the serpents soil your mind; it is the worst of stains

Tearing The Fabric of existence thread by thread,
not looking at the oblivious impending end

Wherever you look it will clench your sight,
a design so spiteful inverting what's right
To a stranger a lark, for the locals a war,
collapse the foundation like never before
