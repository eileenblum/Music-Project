I think I saw a blaze of sorrow
piercing through your mind,
I wish that I could tell the difference
between the wicked and the blind

To see the literature as justice,
to hear the melody of crime,
combine them both into a masterpiece
of some primordial design

Pouring the sentiments on the coherent rhyme,
never knowing it might grow and grow in time,
place the lies you hidden well unto the one you trust,
ensemble of depression, compose the Overture Of Dust

Pouring the sentiments on the coherent rhyme,
never knowing it might grow and grow in time

Divergence of beliefs
combined into formation
no one can achieve,
the clandestine submission

The clandestine submission

Never dare to touch the fire
unless the burning fill your soul
beyond the reason you expired,
there is a feeling that's begging you to crawl

Promise me this
and I will leave you be,
don't you ever dare to stare
into my entity

Pouring the sentiments on the coherent rhyme,
never knowing it might grow and grow in time,
place the lies you hidden well unto the one you trust,
ensemble of depression, compose the Overture Of Dust
