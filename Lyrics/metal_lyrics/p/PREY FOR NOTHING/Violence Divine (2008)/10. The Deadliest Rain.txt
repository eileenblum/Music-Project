How many risks will interlope
this fragile condition of hope,
assurances will bow to the state
bring back the bones that you paid for with hate?

One more step toward an un-final goal
"A change of direction", the rise before the fall

A vision antagonized
as words fell on stones,
a region that is left without shelter
barely with sins to atone

I cannot attain
what is left out of me
as I take cover from
The Deadliest Rain

The more we cry for help
the more our calls are ignored,
condemned to be destroyed
by the M-21 tear drops of God

I cannot attain
what is left out of me
as I take cover from
The Deadliest Rain
