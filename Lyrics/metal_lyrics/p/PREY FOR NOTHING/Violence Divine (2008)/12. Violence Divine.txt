Blessed be the naÃ¯ve who travel so far
only to see their destroyed dreams
a pilgrimage of honesty is now twisted
after years of obscene stream

Blend Into The Darkness,
became as one with nothing at all,
invariable viciousness,
consume another flesh to control

Ask atonement for your mercy
and replace them with malice instead,
salvage the remains of integrity
and mutate them to serve as a blade

Blessed be thy shotgun who keep thee safe at night,
blessed by thy knuckle duster who tend your children right,
blessed be indifference which flag bureaucracy,
blessed be thy Violence which fortify thyself with thee

Ask atonement for your mercy
and replace them with malice instead,
salvage the remains of integrity
and mutate them to serve as a blade

Terrorism doesn't distinguish between human beings,
does not care if it strikes down men or women, adult or infant,
with the stench of death in the air, at the sight of a bomb blast,
while the television shows limbs flying in the streets, somewhere -
someone is watching the same scenes and rubbing his hands together in pleasure
as he plans the next attacks.
