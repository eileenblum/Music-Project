Play your D-N-A like string of a harp
As eulogy of how you gave it up
Devotion and faith from biblical years
Scorched all you achieved, based only in fear

A different setting collides with our own
No one to bear this torch anymore

Sacred Evolution
Devolve back to the spirits of need
Sacred Evolution
Let your country crumble to a kingdom of greed

Stock the flaming end of the words of God
Blur the holy text, all written in blood
Smear the sacrilege, ban the renaissance
God cannot stop this holy puppet dance

A stab in democracy's pitiful ground
No one will bear this torch anymore

Sacred Evolution
The traditional wound that eternally bleeds
Sacred Evolution
The final step to fundamental regime
