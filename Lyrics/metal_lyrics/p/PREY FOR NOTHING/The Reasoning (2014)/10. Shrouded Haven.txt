Barefoot I stride - walking on the autumn leaves
The stars are aligned - The city's calling back its thieves
This pavement is cold - and with every step I tell my tale
A story untold - A ship lost at sea without a sail

It is impossible to run
It is impossible to be done
Seeking a shrouded haven
A shelter found by none

The neon lights fade - But the streets are echoing my name
In midnights I wade - And still it feels more of the same

A lie told so many times - is still a lie
Understanding more and more - won't change it by and by
Shunning myself from the world - alone
Still this pavement growing cold - and no stone left unturned
