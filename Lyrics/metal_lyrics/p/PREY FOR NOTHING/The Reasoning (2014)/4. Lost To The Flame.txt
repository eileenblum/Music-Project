Cold 2011, in the chill of the middle of March
Like a disaster waiting to happen, barely holding its charge
A blazing flame had ignited, revealing a hint of a grin
Disguised as a dying ember, beguiling me into a gin

The ember burns, she hungers for a source of fuel
Her power grows quickly, she's hopping like a fool onto the floor
Then she expands to every wall
With scorching steps, her dreadful grace consumes it all

[Chorus:]
A mournful morning reduced my life to dust
Counting memories to the last
Stories, fabrics, papers, pictures, moments caught in a frame
All I was defined by - All I lost to the flame

I deserve this rude awakening, for letting down my guard
To see my home collapsing, a burning house of cards
A fire I thought that had died, a mistress that dances in awe
The non-metaphorical bash to the face that is my broken jaw

I see 30 years swirling down the drain
Notebooks I've written as a child, poems I've written as a man

[Chorus:]
You stop at nothing, impossible to quench
So hard to kill you, you sot belligerent wench
Playtime is over with this blistering deadly dame
All I was defined by - All is lost to the flame

As I sit in ashes, my hands are searching to find
Something I could hold on ot, a little peace of mind
Nothing lies beneath this blackened veil of cinder
Losing all I'm defined by through the gap between my fingers
