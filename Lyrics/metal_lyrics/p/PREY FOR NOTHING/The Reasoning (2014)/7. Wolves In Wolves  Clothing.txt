Glad you can join us
Please take a sit
The time has come to learn
Why you don't fit

Ungratefulness in its pure form
Pouring concrete to fixate a norm

We're wolves! Let our pack begin the hunt
All dressed in shadows, ever ready to confront

We insist to leave a trail
Yet you won't follow
When every second thought has failed
Is the truth so hard to swallow?

Like father like son
A spineless band
After banishing the hounds
Take possession of their den

Fifth columnists in its pure form
We'll howl and take your world by storm

From the price tags policy you endorsed 
To your government findings, can it get any worse?
Don't you dare to forget what they say
Who is the predator and who is the prey
