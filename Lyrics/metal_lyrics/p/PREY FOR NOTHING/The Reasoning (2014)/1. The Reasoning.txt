A thousand smiling faces
Could not hold back your tears
Perpetual indifference
To the brunt held by your peers

[Pre-chorus:]
Understanding what it'll cost
Your perspective is forever lost
These excuses will exhaust
Even you, my fingers are crossed

This is my grand reasoning
This is how I welcome the end

You swing a terrible truth
Much like an axe
Hoping to chop down
The forest of facts
I now understand
What we must do on our own
A yoke made of iron
We'll reshape to a throne

[Chorus:]
This reasoning is engraved
With the verses of conquering words
This reasoning is what we have
We are left to our own accord

There were no spoils of war to be shared
Yet you horded the loot that we spared
You cannot claim a title that needs to be earned
And this is the lesson you refuse to learn

So take your sluggard decree
That smeared your own name
Back to the place where we started
Before this campaign
Holding a bittersweet grudge
That would smother your flame
This reasoning judge
You got only yourself to blame
