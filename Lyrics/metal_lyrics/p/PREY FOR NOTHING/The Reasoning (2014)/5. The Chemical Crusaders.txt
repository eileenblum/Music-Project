Waking into nightmares
Of a new-old middle east
Engulfed by superstitions
And intricate release
The beast to wear this burden
WIll not join in this feast
Warmongers in our bedrooms
Bequeathed their legacies

So - you'll break an open door
When you step upon my shores
Like the good old times of yore
Claim you spoils of war

[Chorus:]
I will heed the sound
Of the fog horns when they'll ring
When the zero hour comes
Bringing angel on steel wings
My knees kiss the ground
And my face against this loam
As The Chemical Crusaders
Carve their mark upon my home

Dread consumes my lifetime
And depraves me of myself
My family is scattered
I no longer fear my death
Once an educated student
Of your cultures and degrees
Now I walk among you, strangers
In the wasteland you left me

So - read between the slugs
Between trip-wired lugs
Between the graves I dug
Deep down we're all thugs
