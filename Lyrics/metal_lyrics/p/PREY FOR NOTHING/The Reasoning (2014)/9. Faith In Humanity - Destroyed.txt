When all rivers run to the sea
We are left to drink our tears
I await and stand aghast
As our wishes disappear

A legacy of concubines and syncopates
I've hoped to lift this mask a long time ago
Savor this grandeur of delusion
And then leave it room to grow

Facing an emptiness so vast
In a world that is never built to last
And nothing can ever fill this void
As my faith in humanity's destroyed

As it was, now it soon shall be
The gathering lepers, their pipes calling thee
Our cities avulsed, their outsides are in
Surrounded by pity, collapsing in sin

Grinding the gears of the social machine
Both scars and tattoos removed from the skin
But I can't find the courage
To ask for a heart made of tin
