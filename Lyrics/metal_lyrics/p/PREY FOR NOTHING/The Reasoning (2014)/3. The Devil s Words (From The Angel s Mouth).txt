They sweep the land untarnished, embraced by our denial
Whole generations garnished, a face behind the lisle
Inflicted dead weight premise, how dare you wink and smile?
Your beauty in these numbers, a fraction in this wile

[Chorus:]
Not a moment too soon, their dagger faithfully stabs
And now their destinies revealed
The Devil's words drip from the Angel's mouth
And again this falsity concealed

They never dare to dwell deeper, they never dare to learn
The Alphabet is burning, its syllables will turn
Decapitate their numbers, to seconds and to thirds
These Kabalistic spheres shine through the devil's words

[Chorus:]
Not a moment too soon, their dagger faithfully stabs
And now their destinies revealed
The Devil's words drip from the Angel's mouth
And again this falsity concealed
