Through the looking glass we find the evidence we seek
To prove our rights and wrongs and change our morals as we speak
Radiocarbon dating estimates 3000 years
Shedding light unto a subject no one dares to go near

As the world keep turning
Nothing is truly justified
Each of us should ask himself
"How desperate am I?"

Raise the bar for everyone and look the other way
Diminishing your progress, we have led you all astray
Hold on to your precious research with no avail
Nothing you discover can truly tip the scale

History and chemistry and politics combine
First deface the facts and figures, leave nothing to opine
Adding extra steps, and if somehow you'll prevail- 
Like serpents shedding skin, we will remove those scales

Theories combusted
Each one of them is flawed
We all should ask ourselves 
"How far do we take this fraud?"
