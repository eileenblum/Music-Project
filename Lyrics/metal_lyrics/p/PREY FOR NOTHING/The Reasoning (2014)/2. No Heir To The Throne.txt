Powerless I stand before you
The tides of shifting sands of time
Cracks, holes and empty promises
Like that writhing skin of mine

[Chorus:]
Scattered are the ashes of this momentary sigh
Held by the throat I am left on my own
Disciple of titles, I have searched for a sign
And thus I will leave no heir to the throne

In retrospect almost all that we do is a waste
Meaningless cells in a meaningless pace

Monuments of forgetfulness
Surrond me like halos of flies
Regrets that bear no fruit at all
Are all that's left before I die

[Chorus:]
Scattered are the ashes of this momentary sigh
Held by the throat I am left on my own
Disciple of titles, I have searched for a sign
And thus I will leave no heir to the throne

Suit for a king is this effort
Remained behind glass, out of sight
No one is immortal
If our work is embraced by light

[Chorus:]
Scattered are the ashes of this momentary sigh
Held by the throat I am left on my own
Disciple of titles, I have searched for a sign
And thus I will leave no heir to the throne
