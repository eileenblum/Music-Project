[2004 Edition Bonus Track]You were the one that made her cry
You were the one that told her lies
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile
You were the one collecting space
You were the one just saving face
You were the one whose brain moved in circles
Neither an adult or a child

Now it only moves you forward
And back to the blackness at the same time
Burnt out tracks, the world went black
Futile
Lost my head, the world went red
Futile
It's not true, the world went blue
Futile
