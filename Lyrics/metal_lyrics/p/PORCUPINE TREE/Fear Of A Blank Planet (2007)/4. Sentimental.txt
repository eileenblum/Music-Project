I never wanna be old
And I don't want dependents
It's no fun to be told
That you can't blame your parents anymore.

I'm finding it hard to hang from a star
I don't wanna be...
Never wanna be old.

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way wish away each day

I don't really know
If I care what is normal
And I'm not really sure
If the pills I've been taking are helping

I'm wasting my life
Hurting inside
I don't really know
And I'm not really sure...

[x2]
Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way wish away each day
