This means out
This is your way out
Do or drown
Do or drown in torpor

Leave no trace
All my files erased
Burn my clothes
Burn my Prada trainers

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now
Let's leave forever

This is fate
This is your escape
Leave here now
Leave here like it's over

Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now

Let's leave forever
