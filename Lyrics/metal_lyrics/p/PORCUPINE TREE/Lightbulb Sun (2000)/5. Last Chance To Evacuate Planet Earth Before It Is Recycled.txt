[Written by Steven Wilson]

[a) Winding Shot (Summer 1981)]

If you fall asleep with me
You can dream and drowse
The miuntes turn to hours

We could climb a tree or two
And watch the sun go down
Upon our sleepy town

After all the time I spent with you
Summer went away
And we just weren't the same

It's just you and me alone
Not grown ups but not kids
You kissed me on the lips

[b) Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled]

[instrumental]
