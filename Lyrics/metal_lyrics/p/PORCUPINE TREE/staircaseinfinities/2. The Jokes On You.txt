Riding on a unicorn stranded in my mind
Electric raven met me there
To see what we could find

Strange days incredible days
Bring all my children to me
Strange ways incredible ways
On a dark stars endless journey

Endless remains of fading dreams
Lies stranded with the past
We climb up on the wind of change
We say "you know the jokes on you"

Strange days incredible days
Bring all my children to me
Strange ways incredible ways
On a dark stars endless journey

Strange days incredible days
Strange ways incredible ways
