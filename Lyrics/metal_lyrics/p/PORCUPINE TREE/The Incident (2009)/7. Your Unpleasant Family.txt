Your unpleasant family,
smashed up my car
(perfectly uncalled for)

Your unpleasant family,
how vile they are
(I crawled out of the wreckage on my knees)

It's alright my flower
so what did we learn?
(there I found regret amongst the trees)

Snaps of a life,
We had in the garden,
We tear up the flowers
