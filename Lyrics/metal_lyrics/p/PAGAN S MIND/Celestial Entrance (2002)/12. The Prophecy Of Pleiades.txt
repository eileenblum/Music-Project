Walking through winter woods at night
A starlit freezing sky
With confidence and self control
The abscence of the night held my captive soul alive
Felt free to choose...

As I wandered closer
Towards the heart of the night
A strange reflection calling from above
Something gave me pictures, pictures in my mind
Never seen before

[Bridge:]
As a puppet drawn towards...
... A captive mind, no free will
Closer to an unknown place...
... Atmospheric, intense light

[Chorus:]
Waiting in silence
Falling in deep trance [x2]

The strange reflection whispered
Out my name, an unknown voice
Whisper in the trees and in the wind
Heed the call, mysterious
No control of mind
Drawing closer
Freezing sting in my body and my brain
As I felt that I would
Lose all my control
I stopped and
Took a deep big breath

Who am I to face in this night?

[Bridge:]
As a puppet drawn towards...
... A captive mind, no free will
Closer to an unknown place...
... Atmospheric, intense light

[Chorus:]
Waiting in silence
Falling in deep trance [x2]

Heed the call
Of the enlightened conscious ones
Time has ceased
By the trance, you'll see the light

Purified light and sound unexplainable
From the ship came lucid frightened ones
"We came forth the seventh star
Constellation far
We've been here before"
We watched this earth alive...
... Breathing, dying
A science experiment
Bring the Sign, now bring it to
The humankind to all
"A prophecy of our reign"

[Bridge:]
As a puppet drawn towards...
... A captive mind, no free will
Closer to an unknown place...
... Atmospheric, intense light

[Chorus:]
Waiting in silence
Falling in deep trance [x2]

Heed the call
Of the enlightened conscious ones
Time has ceased
By the trance, you'll see the light

"Bring the sign
Now bring it onto
The humankind to all!"
