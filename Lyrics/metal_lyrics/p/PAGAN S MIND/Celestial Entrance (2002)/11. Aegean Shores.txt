Reflecting who I am
I see myself again
I see myself in different lives
Time is running short for me
Like they cry out in my eye
Inside the walls my waiting cell

[Bridge:]
Time goes on and see - miracle set free
In my mind, there's someone calling

[Chorus:]
Somewhere I'll fly away 
High on wings, I'm gazing from the sky
In silent emptiness
I close my eyes

Tonight in darker symphonies
And serenades I cry
Break through the walls who capture me
Let my spirit cry out in my life!
From the sinking land in pain
Saviours from the sky

[Bridge:]
Time goes on and see - miracle set free
In my mind, there's someone calling

Calling for the cry to mesmerize
Through time

[Chorus:]
Somewhere I'll fly away
High on wings, I'm gazing from the sky
In silent emptiness
I close my eyes [x2]

With my mind, somewhere else I'm waiting
High on wings, I'm gazing from the sky [x2]

Await the Aegean shores
