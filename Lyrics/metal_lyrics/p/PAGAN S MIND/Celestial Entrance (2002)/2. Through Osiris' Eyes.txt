The reign of a complex mind
They arrived again
A curse on this vast promised land
Have foreseen the time

[Bridge:]
My pace is slowly dying
Foreseen, the priestess crying
A curse, arriving
Fiend mind, infernal quest
Onward! (Osiris)

[Chorus:]
Eyes of Heaven's reign
Rise of the pageant
Sense the mortal truth
Reach eternal life, through Osiris' eyes

Immortal empire of this land
Deceived by own men's hands
Gods of supremacy race
Claimed the throne again

[Bridge:]
My pace is slowly dying
Foreseen, the priestess crying
A curse, come forth! [x2]
Arriving, onward!

[Chorus:]
Eyes of Heaven's reign
Rise of the pageant
Sense the mortal truth
Reach eternal life, through Osiris' eyes

"The curse has been lifted!"
Empowered through thousands of years
The gods of high sphere
Constructed by allegiances of far
carved their name in stone

[Bridge:]
My pace is slowly dying
Foreseen, the priestess crying
A curse, arriving
Fiend mind, infernal quest
Onward! (Osiris)

[Chorus:]
Eyes of Heaven's reign
Rise of the pageant
Sense the mortal truth
Reach eternal life, through Osiris' eyes
