Lord, give me
Strength to carry on in time
I've seen me born in Luna's light
The healing light...
... To magic crystal skies!

Gazing to mystic starlit sky
Dimensional flight - 
Princess Divine
Guide me through the night
With power within...
... To magic crystal skies!

Like a lucid dream alive - a mystery
Sworn the princess to set free this mistery

I am the warrior of my dreams
Warrior in dreamspace...
(The sirens sing)

Etherical conversation:
"Who are you to walk across
the graves at this late hour?"
"I am only a traveller
in these dreams!"
"We protect these dimensions
with our eternal souls..."
"I was sent by Aurora!"
"Enter the gate and move on..."

Sword in mind I bear
Princess in flames
Dreamscape warrior
Endless - my quest

Like a lucid dream alive - a mystery
Sworn the princess to set free this mystery
Sworn to set you free - this mystery
I hold the key...

"From your day of birth until your final day
You were as determined as
A warrior of these dimensions
Now you've solved the riddle
The palace lies before you"

Waiting for the break of dawn
Crying for the time we all shall fight back!
Waiting for the break of dawn
Crying for the time when we shall all fight back!
