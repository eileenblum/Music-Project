Sleep, my dearest beauty
The time's for you been
Lead behind the wall
Constructing madness
That lies beyond this world
In this chalice dream I have
Keep haunting me again
When in the moonlight your empty shell lies
Baptized in the fire

[Bridge:]
One day we'll unite
In dimensions higher

Mournful misty morning
When abscence warned the essence of your mind
And fading slowly, crystal shining eyes
In the misty moors in rain
I search your ghost again
For in the wind there your lonely soul lies
In spiritual fire

[Bridge:]
One day we'll unite
In dimensions higher

Leave this world of mortal chains
Free from captive shell I rise

[Chorus:]
In my dreams behind
My conscious mind
Through the gates of time
I search again...
... A thorn that scorns within
In dimensions higher

Haunted in my sleep
By darkened force - the force
Forced up from my rest
To a magic quest
The pain that slowly goes away
Somewhere the darkened spirits arise
Waiting someone to cry
The force chants me there all the time...
... In spiritual fire

[Bridge:]
One day we'll unite
In dimensions higher

Leave this world of mortal chains
Free from captive shell I rise

[Chorus:]
In my dreams behind
My conscious mind
Through the gates of time
I search again...
... A thorn that scorns within
In dimensions higher

In search for a lost soul
Dimension of this mystery
Astral projection
Embraced by eternal flames

"Erif laurete eht yojne"

Leave this world of mortal chains
Free from captive shell I rise

[Chorus:]
In my dreams behind
My conscious mind
Through the gates of time
I search again...
... A thorn that scorns within
In dimensions higher
