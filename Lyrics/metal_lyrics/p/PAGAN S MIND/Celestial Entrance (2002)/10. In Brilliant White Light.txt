Tender light upon frozen ground
Approaching the celestial one
Scene of beauty appear before
My fainting eye - a sign

Floating closer, transcendent light
On this magic night revealed
"From far, creator of time"
Answers in time

"On your dimension
You're destined to be
A passive observer
Of life's mystery"

Heed the call
Of the enlightened conscious ones
Time has ceased
By the trance, you'll see the light

Bring the sign
Bring it onto
The humankind to all

"A prophecy of our reign
