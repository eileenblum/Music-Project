Appearing pictures in my mind
Distracting
I see the fate of thousand men
The door to appearance, higher

[Bridge:]
The cry of distant calling
The cry of distant soaring from far

In the sacred sands of Egypt
A secret, wisdom revealed
Carried by immortal gods
Ancient power of distant forces

[Bridge:]
The cry of distant calling
The cry of distant soaring from far

[Chorus:]
I am immortality, ancient creator
Gods of higher sphere
Enter the Stargate
Gate to seventh star
A constellation far

Break the cryptic key of Taurus
And the seven signs of Nexus
Draw the Elysian line of Horus
The open gate
Beyond there, somewhere else await
Await the reborn one
Carried by immortal gods
Ancient power of distant forces

[Bridge:]
The cry of distant calling
The cry of distant soaring from far

[Chorus:]
I am immortality, ancient creator
Gods of higher sphere
Enter the Stargate
Gate to seventh star
A constellation far

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I am immortality, ancient creator
Gods of higher sphere
Enter the Stargate
Gate to seventh star
A constellation far
