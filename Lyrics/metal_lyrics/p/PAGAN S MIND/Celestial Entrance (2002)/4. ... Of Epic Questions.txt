Physical obtained nothingness
A nightside tale!

I am the mighty call
To force you into your fate
Your destiny
Evil try to force you to your knees
A carnal force of darkness

[Chorus:]
What is life? Where is God?
In this dimension
Where is the truth I'm in search for?
What is life? Where is God?
In this dimension
Where is the truth I search?

Physical obtained nothingness
A nightside tale!
Spiritually leaded carved in flesh
Shed the grace

Down in vain...
... You'll feel the pressure building
Up from the skies
Majestic!
Create the pain...
... Of gods and creatures
May you enter
This stage of reign!

I am your emperor
The one imperious
Your master of fate
Cast a spell to drown thee of your strength
Your fatal loss of power

[Chorus:]
What is life? Where is God?
In this dimension
Where is the truth I'm in search for?
What is life? Where is God?
In this dimension
Where is the truth I search?

Physical obtained nothingness
Vault of infernal pressure
Spiritually leaded carved in flesh

I thee dominion
Supremacy of mind
The answer to all
Locust plague the bringer of your pain
And faithful loyal servant

[Chorus:]
What is life? Where is God?
In this dimension
Where is the truth I'm in search for?
What is life? Where is God?
In this dimension
Where is the truth I search?

What is life?
Where is God in this dimension fall?
Where is the truth I'm in search for?

Physical obtained nothingness
Vault of infernal pressure
Spiritually leaded carved in flesh
The epic questions!
