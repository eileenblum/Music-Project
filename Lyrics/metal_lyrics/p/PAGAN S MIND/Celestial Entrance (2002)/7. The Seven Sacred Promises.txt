Changing colours
Lights appearing in the sky
Sights that are messing
With my sanity
In my mind I'm slowly waiting
Waiting to be free

[Bridge:]
Rise
Are they guardians...
... Gods of higher?
With these eyes I see
What I should believe

[Chorus:]
The seven sacred promises
A prophecy of their reign
Still we believe the promises
Promises waiting in time

Gazing starlity sky
Then I try to climb
Time is my chance to
Keep my sanity
Still I'm waiting slowly for the
Time to be set free

[Bridge:]
Rise
Are they guardians...
... Gods of higher?
With these eyes I see
What I should believe

[Chorus:]
The seven sacred promises
A prophecy of their reign
Still we believe the promises
Promises waiting in time

Destructive mourning of
The souls passed by
Oh, how life do lie about it all
In sorrow, grief...
How pain do never cease
The sign do lead us on our
Resurrection, never ending path

Child of Luna's light
Open your eyes to see
Drifting into hazed insanity
Finally the light has taken
Control of my mind

[Bridge:]
Rise
Are they guardians...
... Gods of higher?
With these eyes I see
What I should believe

[Chorus:]
The seven sacred promises
A prophecy of their reign
Still we believe the promises
Promises waiting in time

I believe there's something in my mind
I believe there's something in my mind [x2]
