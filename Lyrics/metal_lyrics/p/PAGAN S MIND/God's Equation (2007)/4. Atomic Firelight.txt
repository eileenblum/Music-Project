Finding the host of our needs
Recall the incense of you
Backfire, darkness prevail
Here we come back again
Cycles to reign

I know there's a change in the future
Follow, now the world is in changes
(I am on the line)
Never vanish, we'll be here forever
Searching for the mystical energy

Time existence, interruption
Indecision. Curse you! Fall!
Me immortal, you destruction
Force our mission, crucify

Endless, the Highest of power
Visions of dimensional changes
(I am on the line)
I am calling for the once lost horizon
Mission: channelizing souls in pain

Firelight
Black cold eyes
As we flow, yet to know
In our dreams, not what it seems
As we flow, seed of life

Ending the life in this soil
Mission is now clarified
Starfire, crash into earth
In Flames you're surrounded, there's no turning back

Heed now, all will discover
Silence, bringing the world to an end
Fearing changes: cent of our nature
Do not fear, all will unite as one...
One!

Firelight
Black cold eyes
As we flow, yet to know
In our dreams, not what it seems
As we flow, seed of life

Time existence, interruption
Indecision. Curse you! Fall!
Me immortal, you destruction
Force our mission, crucify
