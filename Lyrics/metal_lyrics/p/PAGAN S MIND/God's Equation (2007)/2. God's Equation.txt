Flying through space and time
To see what's real and what's fantasy
In silence I'll always remember
To search the open door
And by this conclusion I call you
Escaping through the core

Save us in Heaven's skies
And grant us sign of Life
Stars are rising
Seven senses
With my eyes, do you see?

Racing through endless seas
Reveal the Heavenly Force in you
Building a lifeform with power
The energy in all
Communicate visions as always

I search this open road
I feel like carrying on
And by this conclusion I call you
I call eternally

To the unknown sacrifice
So long, released once again

Incense conclusion
Find the way out from the light
In these dimensions:
Find the way out

Save us in Heaven's skies
And grant us sign of Life
Stars are rising
Outer senses
With my eyes, do you see?
Heavenly fire, Gods of higher
Silent in all their grace

"All lifeforms in this universe are built upon one single, true equation.
A deep, intricate, yet simple equation
That bonds everything together."

In silence I'll always remember
To search the open door
And by this confession I call you
Escaping through the core

In God's true creation,
To save your soul
And by the Equation
The key remains unfold

Save us in Heaven's skies
And grant us sign of Life
Stars are rising
Seven senses
With my eyes, do you see?
Heaven's sensation
God's Equation
Silent in all their grace
