I was seeking the light
When misty morning came
And washed my sins away like rain

As the smoke is slowly clearing
Visions of light
Our revolution

Endless, our dreams carry on
All traces in time
United
Tears in our eyes, escaping the night
Through the eyes of the light, carry on

When tide is running out
In silence all remain
When nightsea breezes in
To hyperspeed exceed,
Illuminated rain
Here my cry to the sky

Endless, our dreams carry on
All traces in time
United
Tears in our eyes, escaping the night
Through the eyes of the light, carry on

Interference congregation
Mission for your secret vision
I see someone in the light
See in supervision
Intelligence collide

Endless, our dreams carry on
All traces in time
United
Tears in our eyes, escaping the night
Through the eyes of the light, carry on

We'll see all the sanctuary
And we're all united
Our vision is clear
No more tears in our eyes
Escaping the night

Through the eyes of the light
Through the eyes of the light
Through the eyes of the light
Carry on!
