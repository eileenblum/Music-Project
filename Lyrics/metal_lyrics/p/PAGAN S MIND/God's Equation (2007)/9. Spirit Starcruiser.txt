I am your pulse
Delivering by machinery stalls
Implant frequency,
Terrorvision energy
Pounding sound,
See the spacecrafts coming

Reborn again from the Heavens
Calling my name he is risen

Flying, I'm all alone
Over seas and lands
I call your name
Soaring through endless times
As I linger I decide

Kneel down, your kind
Rejoin, races exceed
Technical latency
discovering the enemy
Reinforce, Terra's soul is burning

Reborn again from the Heavens
Calling my name he is risen

Flying, I'm all alone
Over seas and lands
I call your name
Soaring through endless times
As I linger I decide

Flying, I'm all alone
Over seas and lands
I call your name
Soaring through endless times
As I linger I decide
Flying, all alone
Seas and lands call your name
Soaring through endless times
Seas and lands
