3, 2, 1, COMMENCE!

I see through spec of terrorvision
Await my turn, prepare countdown
Massive loaded battery stations
Enigmatic cycles, A.I.
Wildfire

Nightsky raging, engines burning
I come alive, The Undertaker
I hunt them down, my engines'
Hellfueled

Take off, lightspeed liquid metal
Cyber engines, all systems go
Hellfire

Speed through the end of time
Racing fast
Spitfire

Ride the sky, sacrifice
Blinded eyes, energize
Ride the sky, I will blind your eyes

Spitfire
Ride the sky, sacrifice
Blinded eyes, energize
Channelize, blackened skies
Ride the sky, I will blind your eyes
Spitfire
