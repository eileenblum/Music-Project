Into the abyss arrive
Returning here again
Over the fields of despair
The messengers came
Forcing all to obey

Led by Gods
The curse will be lifted
And all will see
Triumphant
The Reign has returned
To rule once again

Her eyes stared over the lands....

Her eyes blinding
Spellbound by magic

Evil the hands of men.
We pray to the Gods
To return again

So long, be gone!
Gods of Superior
Cast from their throne
Godsped you all....
Fading away into the starry sky
Never return,
Leave all to burn

Over the vast desert plains
Here to strike again
She was cursing the land to obtain
To build eternal life in mind
On their knees
The pain that would make them
Rise up to this slavery
Casting them back into space

Farewell the menace surrounding us
Cast from her spell,
Now take heed
And leave us!

So long, be gone!
Gods of Superior
Cast from their throne
Godsped you all....
Fading away into the starry sky
Never return,
Leave all to burn
