First arrival of Our Kind
In Eden's scenery
Storytellers of our world
Who made the art and showed us
Ezekiel's sights
Ancient lights
Unspoken war in paradise
Heaven cries

"Lifted their wings...
Mounted up from earth,
Never returned"
Push, push
Insight of You

Painted skies, secret lies
In all dreams, heaven's eyes

Heed the word,
Say your prayers
Read the tokens everywhere
See the signs, ancient rhymes
Is there life?

"Then the Glory of the Lord
Departed from above
The entrance of the temple"

Push, faith, push
Insight of You

Painted skies, secret lies
In all dreams, heaven's eyes
Waste no time, waste no time
Within dreams of men
Heaven's eyes

Push, fear, push, fear push, push
Insight of You

Painted skies, secret lies
Like all dreams, in your eyes
In painted skies, the secret lies
Like all dreams
Heaven's eyes
