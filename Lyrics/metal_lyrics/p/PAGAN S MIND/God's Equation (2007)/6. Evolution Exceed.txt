Supernatural message,
Into soil of earth
Spitting fire invasion
Passive world will burn

Mass destruction, force our mission
Cool winds cleansing
Flesh devoured, slowly fading
Feel the death of our realm
Order of the inquisition
You are left to die

Evolution Exceed
As our visions fly free
Hear our voices searching
All across the lands
So it will be Done
As our visions are growing strong
Letting all you see, what will be
What has been

Massive energy presence
Legacy alive
Alien Entity rising
Massive world collide

Mass destruction, force our mission
Cool winds cleansing
Flesh devoured, slowly fading
Feel the death of our realm
Chained under infernal pressure
None will hear your cries
What is written fade to pieces
Enemies arise

Evolution Exceed
As our visions fly free
Hear our voices searching
All across the lands
So it will be Done
As our visions are growing strong
Letting all you see, what will be
What has been

"The core seems to expand in a pace that the world community is having difficulties to break down
The process of revitalizing our world aura are slowing down
The concern of The United Planet Alliances (U.P.A.) are now on level RED"

Evolution Exceed
As our visions fly free
Hear our voices searching
All across the lands
So it will be Done
As our visions are growing strong
Letting all you see, what will be
What has been

"Every living thing on this planet has an Aura
It's our Legacy"
