I slowly fade away
Leaving the past behind
From what I can't describe
Lifted higher

Leaving my chances, my life
Leaving all my dreams
Conquering all that I've lost
Forever!

[Bridge]
Mass destruction we're on our way
Interference, no one should stay

[Chorus]
If you try to understand it
Then you will find it
Might be time to realize it
And Follow Your Way

I turn the back of time
Finding the pictures of life
I can't recall this dream
In my mind
Leaving my senses to tell
Leaving all my fears
Challenging all that I've lost
Forever!

[Bridge]
Charge to war across the seven seas
Crushing power no disbelief

[Chorus]
If you try to understand it
Then you will find it
Might be time to realize it
Into the eyes of a storm you collide
(I turn the back of time)

[Solo: Jorn Viggo Lofstad]

[Bridge 3]
Even if you understand it
Now it's time to realize it

[Chorus]
If you try to understand it
Then you will find it
Now it's time to realize it
And Follow Your Way

Even if you understand it
(Always remember)
Now it's time to realize it
Into the eyes of a storm you collide

Always remember, forever FREE!
