Taken back in time
Travel throgh the ages
Messenger of fate
Head out to the star now

Intermission takes me higher 
Lift me up unto the sky
Intermission takes me higher
To the edge

Eyes of fire
Watching you listening in silence
I can't believe and I'm lost in your eyes
I know that we'll win in the end

Whispers in the wind
All accross the heavens 
Time will carry on 
This moment you'll arrive 
Arrive

Inspiration to desire
Living life on to the last goodbye
Inspiration to deire 
Takes me higher

Eyes of fire
Watching you listening in silence
I can't believe and I'm lost in your eyes
I know that you'll win in the end

Whispers in the wind

Intermission takes me higher 
Lift me up unto the sky

Eyes of fire
Watching you listening in silence
I can't believe and I'm lost in your eyes
I know that we'll win in the end
I can't believe and I'm lost in your eyes
Believe that you'll win the enda
