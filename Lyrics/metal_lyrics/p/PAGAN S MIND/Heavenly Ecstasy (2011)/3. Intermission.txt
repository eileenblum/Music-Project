Follow the fire

I clench the new horizons
Searching for the inner light
I watch this time goes by
To find the reason why
To find the reason to my prayer

Time will conceal you
Time will unveil

End of the line, I'll be waiting in time
By the stars to be reunited with you
Fire of life, intermission in time
In the end, to be reunited with you

Light....

I touch the light of morning
Flying high above the seas
This mission never ends
I find the key that bends
I find the key that changes all

Time will conceal you
In sacred ways

End of the line, I'll be waiting in time
By the stars to be reunited with you
Fire of life, intermission in time
In the end, to be reunited with you

Following...

Innocence,
Lost behind the walls of time
Once again
Free your mind and realized

Light years away from me
Rejoin again

End of the line, I'll be waiting in time
By the stars to be reunited with you
Fire of life, intermission in time
In the end, to be reunited with you
I'm waiting here

I'll be waiting
And stay true to who you are
And reach out to the stars
We will follow
Follow the fire
Our life
