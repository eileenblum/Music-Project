The night is running low
The time is in changes
One of my visions is changing forevermore
Lights will arrive, eyes of a stranger
But it's not the same without you (Eva)
Cold with a mask, into oblivion
Watch my dreams come back.
Time's running low,Â 
I can't believe it
The truth reveals in time!

Let the light shine and lead us home

Give a hand to the weak and weary
Give them peace and strength to carry on
Can you imagine what a felling that'll be?
Live your life like a dream.

Tides that unfold
Yesterday's faces
And be what we will be
Destiny guides, faith is the reason
You can always choose the way
Time is running low
It is in changes
Watch it all came backÂ 
In all my dreams
I can't believe it
The truth in flames revealed!

Let the light shine and lead us home

Give a hand to the weak and the weary
Give them peace and strength to carry on
No religion that will bring us to our knees
Live your life like a dream!

Give a hand to the weak and the weary
Give them peace and strength to carry on
Can you imagine what a feeling that'll be?
Live your life like a dream!

Reach out to the poor and the needy
Let us lead them to our sanctuary
You will never beg for mercy once again
'Cause you live your life like a dream!

Reach out!
No religion
Believe in yourself
To live your life like a dream!
