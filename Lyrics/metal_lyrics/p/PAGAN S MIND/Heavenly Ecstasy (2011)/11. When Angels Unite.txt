when angel unite I see your eyes watching the night
Watching the lights
Feel, tantalizing
You are a dream I can not describe
See, I'm not awake
I close my eyes and wish it was real
Closer, to what I've become
Watching my destiny
And I can no longer wait
The moment has arrived
Here you are by my side
And this is for real
The pain we feel, left behind
See, I'm still awake
Open my eyes, and know it's for real
