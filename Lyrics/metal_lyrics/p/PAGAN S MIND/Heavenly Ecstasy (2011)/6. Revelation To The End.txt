The sign of sheer destruction
As open sea embraces the land
The ancient signs, a warning at hand

Spiral twisters darkening the horizon
The firey gates of hell unleashed
Infernal darkness, all life has deceased

Killing, fire
Rising higher
Demon bullets
Fight your enemy

I see through all you do

I don't understand
Take back my life, take back my senses
Why, why we are here?
Take back the life from my heart

The cosmic cross arising
As winter solstice now appear
The mystic cycle, precession is near

Intersection to the equinoxes
To axis point, ecliptic key
Approaching ending, the tokens are here

Killing, fire
Rising higher
Demon bullets
Fight your enemy

I see through all you do

I don't understand
Take back my life, take back my senses
Why, why we are here?
Take back the life from my heart

The silent count is over
Though life we know has come to an end
Enlightened ones, we're chosen to stay

Me, the creator of life
Thus our allegiance you broke therefore you'll perish to none
I am the bringer of light
And now with vengeance I'll strike
Watching the cleansing of earth

I see through all you do

I don't understand
Take back my life, take back my senses
Why, why we are here?
Reach out and try one last time
Falling down
By my hand you'll live again
