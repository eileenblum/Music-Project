Hear our words
Like echoes in front of you
Have faith in us, we're strong in our beliefs

Follow the sign, learning to live with each other
The faith in us all, our dreams carry on
The power we hold, we are not alone

[Chorus]
Welcome shadowland you've always been
True to me
Black star shining across the seven seas
Watching me

Keeper of words
No broken promises
Give hope to us and read between the lines

Keeping the faith!
Never again Walk Alone
Together we stand, our mission at hand
Still holding on, the spirit's not gone

[Chorus]
Welcome shadowland you've always been
True to me
Black star shining across the seven seas
Watching me, haunting me

[Keyboard Solo by: Ronny Tegner]

I talked to God, tried to understand
Am I a part of his masterplan?
Show me the way, 'couse I'm still in doubt
Give me my faith!
'Couse I need it now....

Hear my words
No broken promises
The truth will be told, and give hope to us all
Hear our words
Free, no more emptiness!
The signs be revealed
To the entire race!
