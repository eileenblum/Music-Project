Commence your attack.
Into the sky I've been blinded by pressure.
And I play dead,dead I play.
Cease fire!

Die-intoxicate
Death-what you have seen
Feel-that nothing's real
Be-what you can be

Lightyears away
Into The Aftermath
Reach out again
Always shine on

Closer towards me the edge isapproaching.
And there's no return.
Death is not final,it's only the first step you take
Cease fire!

Die-intoxicate
Death-what you have seen
Feel-that nothing's real
Be-for it will be

Lightyears away
Into The Aftermath
Chosen to stay
Always shine on
Higher we rise
HEAVENLY ECSTASY
Carried away to the stars
Embrace it your destiny calls.

All of my dreams shattered to pieces.
And I play dead.

Lightyears away
Into The Aftermath
Reach out again
Always shine on
Higher we rise
HEAVENLY ECSTASY
Carried away to the stars
Embrace it your destiny calls.

I commence my attack.
Gentlemen, commence your attack
Commence your attack.
