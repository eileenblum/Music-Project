Reincarnated by the gods, our kingdom.
We're universal entity, too.
The truth is hidden in the skies,
Concentrated inner eyes.
Now let all imagination fly.

[Chorus:]
Supremacy our kind.
Force of the universe, I am.
Transcending, unending.
Light is the parable of time.

You end up dying.
Hear the Silence Device.
I ruled the land upon your hands.

Ancestral powers of true life,
Approaching!
Transparency of apparition.
Read the truth inside the eyes,
Commencing powers - all unite.
Eternally to tranquility.

[Chorus:]
Supremacy our kind.
Force of the universe, I am.
Transcending, unending.
Light is the parable of time.

You end up dying.
Hear the Silence Device.
I ruled the land upon your hands.

"The domination of nature calls."

Fire in the sky lead by infernal rain.
Seek the signs of change.
To the eyes of the light you'll see,
Lead by their command to all.

"From burning skies of red,
Lights are fading and. They arrived..."

[Chorus:]
Supremacy our kind.
Force of the universe, I am.
Transcending, unending.
Light is the parable of time.

You end up dying.
Hear the Silence Device.
I ruled the land upon your hands.

"The domination of nature calls."

Fire in the sky lead by infernal rain.
Seek the signs of change.
To the eyes of the light you'll see,
Lead by their command to all.
