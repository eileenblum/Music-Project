They came from distance far,
Waiting behind the moonlit sky.
Far away - an ancient lifeform built this race,
To call cyanide aliens.

[Chorus:]
Saved we are, taken far,
rise of the new race.
Heavenly supremacy,
Creating empires to reign,
Eternally and forever more.

Like seed in soil, mankind is born.
Science bred, constructed DNA.
When we tried to find the key inside the core,
Structure search, secret deep inside.

[Chorus:]
Saved we are, taken far,
Rise of the new race.
Heavenly supremacy,
Creating empires to reign,
Eternally and forever more.

Prevailing entities, precendence of the skies.
Far Away, they came out from the constellation,
Cyanide (created our species) aliens.

Energy, supremacy.
majesty, celesty,
Rise of the new race.

[Chorus:]
Saved we are, taken far,
Rise of the new race.
Heavenly supremacy,
Creating empires to reign,
Eternally and forever more.
