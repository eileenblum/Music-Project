Through these sacred eyes I see,
What has been and what will be.
Mesmerized, the will to find the way.
Seeking wide to find the key to mesmerize.
Waiting, climbing, searching the way.

[Bridge:]
Through the skies hear the whispering silence,
To the eyes of the grandest conclusion of war.

[Chorus:]
Charging humanity.
Save us, unite us!
There's whispers in the wind - blowing...

Higher consciousness, our race,
Now involved in the next phase.
Tranquilized, a higher state of grace.
Light the fire in those who dwell - Urantia.
Open their eyes, Mission Athena.

[Bridge:]
Through the skies hear the whispering silence,
To the eyes of the grandest conclusion of war.

Terminate the mortal shell.
Cryptic codes unleashing hell.

[Chorus:]
Charging humanity.
Save us, unite us!
There's whispers in the wind - blowing...

Ascending higher, rise to the light.
The Celestine Prophecy.

Nine insights will lead the way to transform as one.
Charging mass consciousness, twelve tribes of Israel.

[Bridge:]
Through the skies hear the whispering silence,
Charging up to a mindwarp.
Powersource, parallel aiming,
Melting cosmos and Tellus again...

Terminate the mortal shell.
Cryptic codes unleashing Hell.
In this world, United Force...
... Enigmatic Calling all.

[Chorus:]
Charging humanity.
Save us, unite us!
There's whispers in the wind - blowing...

Ascending higher, rise to the light.
Some will rise up, some will perish.
Lead us higher, eternally.
Charging humanity, save us, unite us...
... before the night takes us all.
