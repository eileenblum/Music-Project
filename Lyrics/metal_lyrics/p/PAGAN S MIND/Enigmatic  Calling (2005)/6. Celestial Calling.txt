Deceived by betrayers, lightspeed escape to the sky.
Transcending in vastness and darkness.
Stargate arise - all systems transforming,
Transforming to transparency.
Unseen by the four guards,
Pass through the eyes of the firestorm.

[Bridge:]
Onward - celestial calling,
Saviour of empyreal breed.
Onward - reach for the calling,
Sacrifice the ones who stay.

[Chorus:]
A mission divine - they're freed,
To be staying.
Back to the call of their empire.

Far signals approaching, increasing in intensity.
Lifeforces searching - searching to find,
Enforced by the higher.
Calling from lightyears away, the key to this riddle;
Hidden inside the cryptic eye.

[Chorus:]
A mission divine - they're freed,
To be staying.
Back to the call of their empire.

The calling of gods, reaching out for...
Called by the gods, eternal fire.

Folding cryptic pages round and round.
So hard to find understanding to this riddle deep
Travel through dimensions and transposed through space and time,
The key is undermining all of sense.

The eyes of war searching to find prophecies within.
The Calling - seek the answer in your mind.

[Bridge:]
Onward - celestial calling,
Saviour of empyreal breed.
Onward - reach for the calling,
Sacrifice the ones who stay.

[Chorus:]
A mission divine - they're freed,
To be staying.
Back to the call of their empire.
The calling of gods, reaching out for...
Called by the gods, eternal fire.
