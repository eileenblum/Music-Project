In a trance-like possession, I arose from sleep,
Reading pictures and codes that I recall.
Complex technical structures appears in my mind.
Recess the past, drawing back in time.

[Bridge:]
Ascension of my consciousness.
Memorize a state ablazed.
Rise up to the nebula...

[Chorus:]
Resurrection, my time memories,
To the spheres of light.

Under oath on this night, I pledged the allegiance.
Secret circles of force, an ancient entity.
Epileptical ecstasy - equality.
Bond of ancestory, henceforth now I'm one.

[Bridge:]
Ascending to the seventh star.
Memorize a state ablazed.
Racing through the cosmic shell...

"Ancient wisdom of Gods,
Power of Anathema thee now holds..."

[Chorus:]
Resurrection, my time memories,
To the spheres of light.
Constellations, echoes in time,
Chanting stellar signs.

Resurrection, my time memories,
To the spheres of light.
Constellations, echoes in time,
Chanting stellar signs.

Resurrection, my time memories,
To the spheres of light.
