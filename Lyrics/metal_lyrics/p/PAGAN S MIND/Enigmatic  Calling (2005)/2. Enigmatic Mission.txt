In a ruined ice metropolis,
Searching lost worlds back in time.
Walk the sea of lost imprisoned ones,
To what we are, to what we see.

[Chorus:]
Timewarp, eyes of the nebula.
Transposed back in time.
Starway, change the course of destiny.
Desire of my memories.

Divided souls in black dimensions.
Long lost one, I'll find the way.
Powers to redraw reality, within my hands,
Closer to the...

[Chorus:]
Timewarp, eyes of the nebula.
Transposed back in time.
Starway, change the course of destiny.
Desire of my memories.

Falling between, interstellar,
Multiple damage control,
contracting, bypassing.

[Chorus:]
Timewarp, eyes of the nebula.
Transposed back in time.
Starway, changing the course of time.
The enigmatic calling for my memories.

Desire of my memories.
Time will pass by.
