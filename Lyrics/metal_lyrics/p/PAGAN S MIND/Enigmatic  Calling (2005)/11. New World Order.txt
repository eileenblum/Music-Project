From crimson burning skies,
Arrival of unknown existence approaching closer.
Disconnecting understanding to be free.

[Bridge:]
Somewhere lost in time, I'm dreaming,
And my lifeline is closing in.
Freed now, unchained.

[Chorus:]
Echoes in time - we`re left behind to understand.
This mystery haunts me.
Seeking, finding - codes entwining.
Somewhere deep inside me, racing through my soul,
Freed now - unchained.
Alive again.

Coded minds forever, key within - inside your mind.

Back to their reign. Lights are fading.
They finally arrived to the new world order.
Analyzing humans being.

Standing up against the light, facing fear.

Somewhere lost in time, I'm dreaming,
And my lifeline is closing in.
Freed now, unchained.

Coded minds forever calling.
Key within - inside your mind.
