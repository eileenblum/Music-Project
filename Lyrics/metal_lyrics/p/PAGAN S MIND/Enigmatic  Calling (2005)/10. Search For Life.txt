Awakened from embrace of sorrow.
Heal the spirit deep inside.
Call the new era tomorrow.

We will unite as one, and signs will unfold.
Always searching for the key they lost.
Finding true life`s essence - uniqueness of our kind.

And we travelled, drawn back in time,
To our endless dream lead by starlight.
Horizons of hope calling from within.
