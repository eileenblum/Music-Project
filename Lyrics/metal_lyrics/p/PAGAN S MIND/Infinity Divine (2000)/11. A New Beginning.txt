In my eyes, closer to
Destiny revealed for you
Darkened self, sins of mine
Eyes of lies, no compromise

Time has lost your
The time enclosed your inner lies
Mind of treason
You played your life profound my way

[Chorus:]
Enclosed to your
Your eyes do wander too
A new beginning, look in your eyes

Gaze the shores of endless pain
Turn to see your guiding hand
Life this life state of thrill
Open up your mind's free will

Time has lost your
The time enclosed your inner lies
Mind of treason
You played your life profound my way

Realize
Learn to open up your mind
Mystify
Breathe the air surrounding your
Light to dark
You are I and I are you
And closer to
The path will open in front of you

Here you lie, here you cry
The the step above the sky
Tokens dark, evil shell
Shut the door to your own hell

[Chorus]
