Miracle born
Baptized in lunas light
The rain fell hard that day

Silver misty rain
The kye to galactica
Behold, fantasia arise
Secret land arise

[Chorus:]
Like a dream
Falling into the skyline
Tears we should cry
Melted into the sea
Virtual life life from another dimension
I see the light
Dawn of a crystal sky

Cherish the land
The gates of ivory
The mist that never cease

Forsaken maidens cry
Our vision utopia
Behold, twilight arise
Secret land arise

[Chorus]

Thriumph of gods
Bow to infinite ones
The fortune tales the past

Immortal presence be
The guide to eternity
Behold, twilight arise
Secret land arise

[Chorus]
