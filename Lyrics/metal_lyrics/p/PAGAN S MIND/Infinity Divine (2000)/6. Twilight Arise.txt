Things will get changed in my way
I'll be back everyday
Not a minute too late
Turn back time, turn the back of time
Eternal life for me

[Bridge:]
Vision divine, you'll be clear in my mind
Show me the art of time

Drawing the meaning of life
Sense the vision of times, its our future to be
Holy quest, sacred quest of life
Equal to live nor die

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Crying out, angels serenity
Dare you dream
Live your life
Born with a pagan's mind
Free all you can in your mind
To be free!

Father time, release me free
I walked upon this earth no meaning at all
Holy wish, sacred wish of time
Transcendant journey
Till the end of time

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
