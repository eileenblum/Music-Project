A teardrop lined your chin
The marble skin your empty shell
For now you descend
Where your dreams dwell
I strain my vision far
And gather all thy rays
A slumber sleep
Your flight to endless shores
Has ceased your self

In lunas noble light
A starry sky the angels cry
The path in front of your life
Did face and end
Enclosed by endless peace
A silent hush through
Branches of trees
Enforced by earth to leave

[Chorus:]
I know the time has ceased
Tears fill my eyes, I'll see
Drowned in grace, my loneliness
Under the moonlight sky
We signed our pact

Await the fall of life
The sands of time
Did grant me sleep
I have no longer tears to weep
A rainy stormful night
The sky cleared up
And from the clouds
Your marble skin had come to life

[Chorus]
