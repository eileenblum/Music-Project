A silent whisper glimpsed my eye
Told the story of a time
You were here before and ruled a land upon your fatal hand
Sea and shallow waters, mountains high, the empire of a king
This is the mirror of your dreams

Crystal sky
Tell me why

Reflections of my past life tell
Me the history of time
I have seen myself in roles I never dared believe I see
Crystal Shadows Mourning, astral light, the beauty of this night
I sense the the dawning of a newborn day

Rise towards the magic sword
Hail be to all masters words

[Chorus:]
The quest of a king
I'm lifted by the eye
I see the light
Rise higher with me
Lift me up to my dreams
The quest of a king
The quest of a king

The whisper opened my third eye
Granted me the sight to see
What will be and what has been
The past existed as I speak
Parallel dimension, fall of life
In cycles born again
Your spirit is immortal

A silent whisper glimpsed my eye
Told the story of a time
You were here before and ruled a land upon your fatal hand
Sea and shallow waters, mountains high, the empire of a king
This is the mirror of your dreams

[Chorus x2]
