Dying of terror the lust in your eyes
Temptressed by your glance
As you fade away

[Bridge:]
Achieving higher steps
To a perfect life
Gaze a crystal sky
Its wept away
Your sorrow end

Paint all my pictures with glanzed perfect eye
Fall into the visions then wonder why

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Your wanderlust so high
Wanderlust so high to try
Truth I'll find
I'll never can describe

Take the chance
You are what you mean you can be
When trying you fail
In times that you

Seize the moments that's true
FUll of life
When nightbreezes whispers you to unwind

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
