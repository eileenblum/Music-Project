Falling into deep trance
Linked to my inner self
Follow steps of the wisdom masters
Bearers of the way

Concentrate, you elevate
An ancient art reveals
The spirit self begins its journey
Freed from the mortal shell

Focus mind you can walk into what
World you want to see
Four dimensional sight in mist
Train the inner eye

Silver thread, essential line
Too thin may cause your death
Beware unholy presences
Do not go in their way

[Chorus:]
Life's altar revealed
Crowned with roses and lilies - oh
Into grace I'm lifted up
A deepened state
Hight to purchase seventh shores
I gaze to other worlds

Out of body experience
The state of bordering sleep
Let go of fear you should concentrate on
The light that leads the way

Condition D, time to leave
Projection through mind's gate
Attend respect of the highest level
As wandering along the way

[Chorus]

Now you've learned the master craft
Whispered through the wind
Gained control of the higher senses
New life will now begin!
Now be wise, no compromise
Thou art is so divine!
Chosen you are, use it for good
Or thus will face death's line

[Chorus]
