I experienced a mystic rain
Freed from all my sorrows
Ive left them behind
A perfect sudden drama - Shine!
Someones crying out my
My name

Pounding, pounding at the gate
In shallow waters

The path of righteousness lies clear fronts my eyes
I sense majestic empires
I once ruled a land
Phantasious visions thrill my eyes
Patterns slowly unveiling
A key to the gate!

Pounding, pounding at the gate
In shallow waters

[Chorus:]
Rise to fall
Rise to the winterstorm
Cleansed by the light, fear no dark hell in sight
Theres no room for the weak at heart
Sword in my hand now
To strike down the dark
High on my silver wings
Descend all mortal sins
True to creations shores

Cut the strings to reality
Climb the path
Dreams I dream become my life
I see them impact
Threads are nimbly twining
Escape through the gate
Drawing closer to awake
This dream is alive!

[Chorus]
