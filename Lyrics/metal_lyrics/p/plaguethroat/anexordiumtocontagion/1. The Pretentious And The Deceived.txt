Pain is an illusion, Crafted to divert.
Pain is a lie, its all in your mind
Desire of defiance, compelling your fear
A impulsive force, denying for deviation.
A blackened reminiscence, designing thoughts
Conceiling your reality, drifting figures
Animate the dead soul, with fiery eyes
With a heart so dead cold, BLINDED TO FALL!!!
BLINDED TO FALL!!!
Awaken in madness, escaping this delusion
Descending into the void, trapped in a sphere of lies
A definitive error, in fragments of ages
Perpetual chaos at timeless measures, subjected to torture
Breaking through still vision
Execute sedation and intention to destroy a fragile mind
A twisted story devised by the wicked
Sold to the weak mind, waiting to be fed
Slowly they decay, with their false righteousness.
THE PRETENTIOUS AND THE DECEIVED!!!!
