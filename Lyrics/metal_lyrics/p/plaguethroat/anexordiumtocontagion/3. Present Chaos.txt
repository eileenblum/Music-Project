Nations fallen, community divided,
Hatred for religion, hatred for race.
Dark shadows and depressions, curse our soul

Violence and bloodshed, ruins tranquility.
Fighting for life, Fighting for our creed
Destroying of the temples, burning of the churches
Exterminate our sinister mind.

No sign of peace
No sign of Harmony. [2x]

People cried out in agony
Strengthened our weakness, Strengthened our mind [2x]

Cry for freedom,
Pray for peace.
In this present chaos
Lets stop war!!!!

Violence and bloodshed, ruins tranquility.
Fighting for life, Fighting for our creed
Destroying of the temples, burning of the churches
Exterminate our sinister mind.
