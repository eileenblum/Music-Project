We think we grasp, upon their stance
All we know, no life exist
Faith is sealed, the young and old
took one by one to honor a soul
The plague begun, with no justice serve,
there's no one there, to stop the crime.

The attack was a genocide,
when they came, left no one alive,
all been played and burnt alive, they left no sign. BURN!!
BURN THE VICIOUS!!

Watch em kill, watch em die,
an unusual crime, a destructive mind,
merciless savage beatings drowning in their own blood

If peace is what we ask for, in this holocaust,
Sadistic aggression, Eradication of the Weak
