Down this Shit, cant hardly breathe,
we see, a shadow of annoyance,
Spawn my greens, see what you see,
SMOKE IT HIGHER.

Look before and after, more truth revealed,
fragments of imagination, over broken windows.
A Heart of stone remorse will weaken, Diminishing fear,
once tricked by hate of veiled Deceptions Desire for revenge,
Drowned in tranquil moments.

SPAWN MY GREENS, SEE WHAT YOU SEE,
BURN WITH DESIRE, SMOKE IT HIGHER!
