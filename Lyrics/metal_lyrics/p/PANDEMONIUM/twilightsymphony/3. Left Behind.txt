As I shrink into the shadows 
I remember what was then 
There is something missing 
Like a piece of me... 

Haunting mists are following me 
you will never be again 

Like a ship, on the everflowing seas 
ever drifting away 
life?s light blown out by a wind of unbeing 
could do nothing more, 
it was all lost, when you died. 

Left behind I can recall 
what you knew and what you were 
All these thoughts and memories 
unable to share 

Haunting mists are following me 
you will never be again 

Like a ship, on the everflowing seas 
ever drifting away 
life?s light blown out by a wind of unbeing 
could do nothing more, 
it was all lost, when you died. 

Left behind 

The starlit passages of rain that fall 
Infernal memories of dreams we had, 
now ever in the shadows of the dead. 

Alone I sit and wonder what went wrong 
a sparkling candle, then you are gone 
The pain that's glowing in my heart 
Who would have known you would so swiftly depart? 

Life?s light blown out by a wind of unbeing 
could do nothing more, 
it was all lost, when you died. 

In mourning now, 
we stare at the remnants 
of a life so glorius. 
Never to see, never to be, evermore 
rushing at futile flickers 
of hope in the dusk, 
I am 

Left behind
