As we reach unto the sky 
living fearful in a lie 
we stop and stare upon the starlit fields we see 
Out there I watch the trail of streaming light 
defining patterns in the shining eyes 

My lifeblood, that feeds my will to be 
is slowly deserting me 
The silence from your lips deceives your true intentions 
and it follows me into the grave 

Those shining eyes, I feel their cold gaze 

My lifeblood, that feeds my will to be 
is slowly deserting me 
The silence from your lips deceives your true intentions 
and it follows me into the grave 

As we reach unto the sky 
living fearful in a lie 
we stop and stare upon the starlit fields we see 
Out there I watch the trail of streaming light 
defining patterns in the shining eyes 
-staring back at me 

As our world is set on a course that is bound 
to lead to extinction 
Our minds wont still allow us to 
think in different ways 
A silent roar rising up to the ceiling 
of suppressed emotions 
I try to look into your mind 
but a barren wasteland is all I see 

Those shining eyes, I feel their cold gaze 
Those shining eyes are staring at me 
whispering statues marbled in stone 
Starting to transform into a shape 
that was previously to them unknown 

Running in fear of denial 
afraid of losing what little dignity is left in me 
A violent roar of anger and frustration 
will my soul never taste the light? 

Reaching to the sky... 
Living fearful until we die... 
Afraid of living 
afraid of ourselves 
For all we know 
we must die to end this proces
