The twilight darkness is growing in our souls 
And the twilight symphony is playing thousands of tones 
The tones that lead us to the eternal night 
The night that makes us blind with all its might 

I can feel the pain 
Listening to the mourning of the lost 
Confronting emotions cold as winter frost 

When the glimmering stars are covering the sky 
My dreams turn strong and I close my eyes 
I start to fall into the mysteries of night 
When I hear the symphony of the twilight 
The tones of beauty and tones of pain 
Blind my body, it is hopeless to explain 
Twisted fantasies are coming down 
When the tones of the night begin to drown 

Listening to the twilight symphony 
And feel the tones of an elegy 
Forever confronting the sadness that the music brings 

The cold nights have awoken me 
But my soul is still asleep 
Drifting by the wind 
Followed by the twilight tones 
The tones I always hear 
Tones so full of misery 
A reflection of a life 
Empty and without lust 

Listening to the twilight symphony 
And feel the tones of an elegy 
A requiem performed with lucid purity of blind emotions 
Empty I feel when I listen to the twilight tones 
Beauty and pain 
Turning the pages 
Infinity, chaos I will find 

The twilight darkness is growing in our souls 
And the twilight symphony is playing thousands of tones 
The tones that lead us to the eternal night 
The night that makes us blind with all its might 

I can feel the pain 
Listening to the mourning of the lost 
Confronting emotions cold as winter frost.
