Looking through my inner past,
And I see your spirit walking around

Eternally lost, confused I am screaming for your response
why have you left me behind?
A choice made so blind, a step in the night
a night so misty and cold...

Left in tears and eternal suffering
You are like opium so enticing...
so pretended...

Silent she walks and silent she laughs at her impurity
So many souls, so many lives, so many tears she has thrown into flames
All of her deeds, all of her crimes are pictures of this frozen world
Want to escape but cannot escape, she must pay for her sins...

She will pay for her sins...

She twinkles with her eyes,
the eternal sleep is waiting.
I hope you will get the same,
the same you have given me.
