The summary of all white lies, reunites under the darkest skies
-can you hear the thunder roll my friend?
From deep inside it saturates, dissipates into the night
leaving in its trail no more than pain
Rising from my throat, a shriek of agony
as your contemplations are revealed
Darkness comes to darkened minds, only out for an unfair fight
filled up with their hatred and their fear.

Oh, my heart is cold
Like the coldest dawn on this earth
Sacrificed for the sake of believing
Believing in trust...

Oh, the manipulative cries
tormented a thousand times
Seeking with ambition - forever destined to fail
You revealed the stairway out of here
Bitterness again, denied the chance of relief

From deep inside it saturates, dissipates into the night
leaving in its trail no more than pain
Rising from my throat, a shriek of agony
as your contemplations are revealed
Darkness comes to darkened minds, only out for an unfair fight
filled up with their hatred and their fear.

Oh, my heart is cold
Like the coldest dawn on this earth
Sacrificed for the sake of believing
Believing in trust...

Reaching away, where the thought cannot see
Entwined in embrace of engulfing flames
As the morning comes with the light of day
Forever whirling faster, will it lead me...
To apeiron
