Tides of darkness approached,
bringing the smell of fading flowers so morose.
Interrupting the dance towards the blooming fields,
the fields where I had wished to sleep.
Where the grass turned into needles,
a paradise transformed to battleground.
And here the battle began, here the battle was won
by the stars, and with the contemporarily colouring sun.
Cold bitter darkness levitated above my lands once so green.
Sublime shadows wrap their arms around me.
Wellknown realms now rest in grey absorbing steams

My eyes enclosed
Never more to see the light of dawn
My ears deprived
Never more to hear the shrieks of swans
But deep from the profound I grow

Mountains arose were peaceful paths once went so straight.
A winter so cold struck with furious storms of hate.
Anxious dreamers lost in the seas of time.
Frozen and afraid they fall asleep.

My eyes enclosed
Never more to see the light of dawn
My ears deprived
Never more to hear the shrieks of swans
But deep from the profound I grow

So tenderly you touched my pale skin
Erasing melancholic structures within.
You kissed my parched lips
Like water silently engraving the cliffs.
You removed the burden from my shoulders
You opened up my sleeping eyes.
You broke my coffin firmly locked in prediction
and in hope that I would die

(Thought:
You trailed me out from the tunnel,
me running through striking fists.
Rapidly heading for nowhere
among my own confusing mists
And so I see your hand, your inviting hand
but it is oh so far away
Will it take me home
or will it lead me all astray?)

Mountains arose were peaceful paths once went so straight.
A winter so cold struck with furious storms of hate.
Anxious dreamers lost in the seas of time,
silently awaiting a final peace of mind.

Awoken from my hibernation
returned from my inner journey
after rushing through my darkened past
all my memories of mourning
I now gaze at the stars and I think of you
smiling at me so beautiful

Revived into the lights bane
eternity it shines like gold
You sit beside me, I face your eyes
and plunge into the untold
Like hypnotized I followed you
but suddenly I watch you walk away...
