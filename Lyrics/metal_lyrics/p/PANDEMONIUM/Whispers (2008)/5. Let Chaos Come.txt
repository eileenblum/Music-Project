[Lyrics: Wallin]

Cry out my name as a warning
Cry your fears to the wind
Let them carry far and wide
And hope they reach some of your kind

I bring you the fears of night
Darkness it walks by my side
And I carry in both of my arms
The power to end all your time

Behind the silver screen a watcher hides
Shying in the cover of night
An observer and my enemy
Someone I must not allow
To reach my goal ahead of me
Or the burden I carry will fail
In its purpose to destroy you all
Bringing ruin to worlds and to days

The malice bound in me
Controls my every thought
And the hate for all of life
Inside it burns so pure

The fire spawned in me
Commands my ecstasy
Like rivers of joy in my system
It feeds me and tells me what I must destroy

Curse the bastard authority
That forces me into this war
My only wish is now to be
Named a destroyer no more

Cry out my name as a warning
Cry your fears to the wind
Let them carry far and wide
And hope they reach some of your kind

I bring you the fears of night
Darkness it walks by my side
And I carry in both of my arms
The power to end all your time

In vain you seek a hiding for yourself
From the ever approaching fate
You will die alone in the rain
That pours down in endless streams
Like tears from the sky that mourn this day
And all that were lost were for nought
A figure shrouded in mist appears
Shining like a being of gold

The rain upon thy soul
It will not cease
As long as death and hate
Command your every move

Come now
Release the will
Your desire will soon be instilled
Recognize all the joy you have sworn off
And the spell it will be broken

My mind it is dark this day
Darker than ever before
Freedom lies within my grasp
But the darkness has given me more

Rain upon us
Wash away the filth
That draws the mind into black
And threatens to take in us all

Dream of an eternity
With power and glory all mine
Wanting only domination
And cursing it couldn't be mine

As the dawn approaches
Golden shapes are all around me
Looking like they will kill
But they offer one solution
That will let me live
To follow my own free will

Spit at the name of the one I used to be
This abhorrent entity
And release the dormant shape
That must come forth and prevail

Gone is the power that was vested in me
My spirit has broken its pact
And destruction has been wrested from me
I cannot command it no more

At the sudden separation of forces
A reaction has occurred
In the parting of the two that were one
A massive explosion is heard

I can never be again
The power that I was
Yet something has been gained

Inside this heart a new flame burns
That sends out hope
Gone is the shadow
That was all that mattered
And fear is no longer my name

Come the restful absolution of my days
As the one who delivered the final fate
When my being is set ablaze

Their eyes upon me
I travel now into their realm
I rest in silence as my body is thrown to the ground
