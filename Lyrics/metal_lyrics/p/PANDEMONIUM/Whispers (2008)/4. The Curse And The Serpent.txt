[Lyrics: Ahlgren]

The curse and the serpent in symbiosis
Unite in the face of the evil one
The horrors of death appear in my eyes
Fury and wrath embraced in silence
Deny and I will bring you
The powers of night and the devil's bride
Lullabies sung by wicked angels
Seduced and nailed you fall apart

The storms have been unleashed
Enjoy the game we play together
It's pure misanthropy
Erotic myths and mystic spirits
Our sins are made of flesh and blood
Taste the world of darkened passions
Do you hear the call?

Come embrace the darkness
By night we gather all our strength
Infecting all the weak
Dressed in gowns they'll search for peace
Fallen like the dead
I hear them scream on my command
A universe of pain I rule
You see: my eyes are cruel

Blessed by the curse we passed the gate
A serpent touch you gave
To the carnival's morning I'm lost in a maze
Midians' claws have grabbed the thousand souls
Hand by hand they walk as one in grace
Unto the empty halls of flaming haze

The curse and the serpent in symbiosis
Unite in the face of the evil one
The horrors of death appear in my eyes
Fury and wrath embraced in silence

Caressed by the sounds of thunder
Damnation has become
The guide to human secrets
That we hold so beloved
Faithless are the creatures
Who's souls now fade away
Rejected from the house of gods
You choose to walk my way
In pain

I crush you all beneath my feet
Your purity is filth
Promises cursed by the shadows of the dead
Can't escape because your soul has been misled

The curse and the serpent in symbiosis
Unite in the face of the evil one
The horrors of death appear in my eyes
Fury and wrath embraced in silence
Deny and I will bring you
The powers of night and the devil's bride
Lullabies sung by wicked angels
Seduced and nailed you fall apart

Caressed by the sounds of thunder
Damnation has become
The guide to human secrets
That we hold so beloved
Faithless are the creatures
Who's souls now fade away
Rejected from the house of gods
You choose to walk my way
In pain
