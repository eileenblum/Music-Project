[Lyrics: Ahlgren]

When the shadows appear
I feel a touch from the dead
I open my eyes into a new world of fear
My soul is caressed by the hands of the unblessed
Falling into silence
In flames I lay to rest

Seduced by the one who enthroned my inner self
Behind the mask
The torment was waiting to prevail
The mourning, the screams
The pleasure was to curse
The one who slept in grace

In plagues they raise their arms
To be embraced by the spirits
That bring them endless nights

I see the water reflect a human face
A blind man's acts I practice
I walk around in sleep
But the truth is hidden
Melancholic winds are blowing with a prophecy

Behind the mask
There's a face of evil
Something that was meant to be
Behind the mask there's a creature in pain
Searching for the light
To be released from torment

Hiding from myself
Hiding from eternal hatred
Impossible to flee
Dark is my eternity
Once so plain and beautiful
Despair has cursed the face
The flames have spawned my dark impurity

Disgrace from the world below has occurred
The oath was sworn to me
But the one behind the mask
Is blessed by death and heresy

I'll see them fall
Obedience to the mask is all
Fools they will remain
My wisdom tells they'll burn in pain
The serpent has seduced me once
Like Eve I've tasted the unknown
Forbidden fruits: a cursed proposal
Of the one behind the mask

The joyful times have changed into an endless night
The souls that fell are abandoning the light
Now the hall of flames is their home
No one will hear when the songs of repentance are sung

I close my eyes
My mind is bright
Released from ghosts of suicide
Who'll care?
In death we'll all unite

Behind the mask
There's a face of evil
Something that was meant to be
Behind the mask there's a creature in pain
Searching for the light
To be released from torment

Hiding from myself
Hiding from eternal hatred
Impossible to flee
Dark is my eternity
Once so plain and beautiful
Despair has cursed the face
The flames have spawned my dark impurity

Through the nightmares and horrors I've walked alone
Ever since the time I stepped down from my throne
Luscious spirits tempt my soul
Imprinted memories blind me when I moan

When the shadows appear
I feel a touch from the dead
I open my eyes into a new world of fear
My soul is caressed by the hands of the unblessed
Falling into silence
In flames I lay to rest

"Hoc est corpus meum
This is my body, this is my flesh
Hoc est corpus meum
I present myself to thee
Hoc est corpus meum
This is my body, this is my flesh
Hoc est corpus meum
As a fallen entity"

The time has come for you to see
The secrets of your hollow soul
It all turned out to be
A monument of a faceless creature
Anthems of an evil seed
Something that will be eternal
In this chaos and insanity

Through the nightmares and horrors I've walked alone
Ever since the time I stepped down from my throne
Luscious spirits tempt my soul
Imprinted memories blind me when I moan
