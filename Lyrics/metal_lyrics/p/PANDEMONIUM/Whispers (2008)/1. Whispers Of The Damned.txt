[Lyrics: Ahlgren]

Whispers of the damned
Unspoken words consuming us and leaving us to cry
Mystified redemptions
Bold misanthropy
Our minds are poisoned with the gift of terrifying dreams

What have they done to your soul, my precious?
Left to be a victim in the shadows of the night
Leading our eyes to look another way
Cast the spell of tyranny and fade away the day

Oh I wish that I could have seen
The beauty of the everlasting pictures
And the blood stained face of yours
Vengeance is here
Body disappears
Into the holes where evil dwells
Seduced by inner calls

Now I see what you have seen
The lilies wither
A storm in the night
And the cosmic collapse

Time to face the secrets of Eden that never were told
I defy the eyes of darkness around
Far away in a distant future
She will show her passion for the six-six-six

Night time is falling upon our souls
Can you feel the unleashing of powers?
Searching for life and the symbols of light
Falling apart under thundering skies

Feeling the might
Screaming in sorrow your voice in the night
The dreams that we shared of lust and desires
Lost in the grave, burnt in the fire
Now that we see the results
We close our eyes and turn our backs
The tragedy in our souls is complete
Take my hand and walk away in the storm
A collective demise points at the sign that you had to follow
No one will ever remember the choice

Cry out thy lust
No one will ever remember
The words that you have spoken
Are locked in a tomb
Forgotten and lost forever

What have they done to your soul, my precious?
Left to be a victim in the shadows of the night
Leading our eyes to look another way
Cast the spell of tyranny and fade away the day

Oh I wish that I could have seen
The beauty of the everlasting pictures
And the blood stained face of yours
Vengeance is here
Body disappears
Into the holes where evil dwells
Seduced by inner calls

Time to face the secrets of Eden that never were told
I defy the eyes of darkness around
