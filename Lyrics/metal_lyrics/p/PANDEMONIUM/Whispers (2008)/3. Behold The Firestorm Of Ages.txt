[Lyrics: Wallin]

Grim are the times when this flame must arise
Drawn from the bottomless depths of the earth
A silent fury unleashed
Breaking and shattering all that it sees

Moving towards the remnants of a structure once proud
Now ashes are the only proof of what once stood
The soil is blackened by soot
What has become of this glorious place?
The streams that used to run by have all vaporised
A flock of birds move by
But the barren waste offers nothing for them
All turned to ruins and left to the wind

Gone
Echoes are all that remain
Done
The force of destruction unleashed

What can end an existence so lightly?
Where now has everything gone?
The definition of absolute power
Reigning in silence alone

A silent fury on the surface of the lake
Reminding us of days and dreams
That we have been denied
Sordid the dreams of this world have become
The water shows a warning
Of the power supreme to return

Cry out in an empty hall
Long grow the echoes and silence grows cold
Name is forgotten and memory old

The woods will crumble and
The earth it will heave
Can the paralyzing fear be relieved?
Dream the dream of winter again
Rest in the silence it brings

Behold the firestorm of ages
As it turns all that moves into naught
A destruction that is boundless
And a crushing force

Gone
Echoes are all that remain
Won
Leveling the land

What can end an existence so lightly?
Where now has everything gone?
The definition of absolute power
Reigning in silence alone

The screams of vanity
Calling the power inside to come forth
In silence echoing the words that will
Summon my fantasy to me
Command us and the power supreme to be ours
Return to dreaming
Where the power lies

In infinity the slumber shall ever be
And I summon now this power to me
To destroy
To shatter and crush
The dreams of humanity
The flame it will come forth
And destruction shall be

Behold the firestorm of ages
As it turns all that moves into naught
A destruction that is boundless
And a crushing force

Into the arms of infinity
My power it delivers thee
Return to sleep again
And trouble no more

A silent fury on the surface of the lake
Reminding us of days and dreams
That we have been denied
Sordid the dreams of this world have become
The water shows a warning
Of the power supreme to return

The range of cloud and smoke emits a sigh
The fog goes down again
Dreaming of a silent end of days
Cathartic cleansing in the flames so full of hate
The dreamless sleep of an age has been erased
