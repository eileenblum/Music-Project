[Lyrics: Wallin]

Send a great release to the world
The voice of foresight is to be heard
Bringing justice and truth to depend on
A tale to tell to the end

Hold on to your beliefs
Pay no heed to those
Who try and lead us astray

The guardians of truth
Ever holding on to firm beliefs
Try to deny the freedom of creative thinking

Beneath the burning altar of the unseen worlds
In an act to cover and cut off the
Million ways that are yet to open
The guardians preserve this truth
In their vision blinding us
To what might be

We only know this one
The only one to be
The only one you will ever see

A crushing might that reveals no lie
Tells me of this one, the only one to be
The only one I shall ever see
The truth to end all truths
There has only ever been this one

Organic pain collector
Filled with sins of those
That think and act against
Show us what you have seen

In a story of grief and misspent hope
The pain collector gathers all
The failures of this world
And keeps them on display
As a warning to one and to all
It motivates the following
Of a strict regime
But holds a greater power on its own

We only know this one
The only one to be
The only one you will ever see

That which is not to our pleasure
Must be contained
What can not be contained
We will eliminate

Organic pain collector
Spew forth what you have seen
That the world may envision
An alternate ending and sow
The seeds to plant the beginning of
A future yet unknown
In the wake of thy relief
Shall come a massive storm
To be named the final one
But all shall be as one in this release
Ignorant to all but the suffering
Caused by countless generations
Not this one alone

Amassed in a giant resounding blow
To numb the senses of those that still stand
In this action awakening the hope
And a new day shall again be greeted without a sigh

Push aside
The structures that are set in stone
And make your way up to the throne
Your rule is of justice and wisdom and truth

Send a great release to the world
The voice of foresight is to be heard
Bringing justice and truth to depend on
A tale to tell to the end

A crushing might that reveals no lie
Tells me of this one
The truth to end all truths
There will ever be this one
