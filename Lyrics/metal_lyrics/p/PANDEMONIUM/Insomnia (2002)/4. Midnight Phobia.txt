Through emptiness we walk
And see the unseen
Facing the world of the lost
The beauty in my dreams
Appears in front of my eyes
The moments I wish could remain
Forever, in the empty moments of life

The moonlight shadows hunting in the night
As we see the nocturnal emptiness in the sky (so high)...

Imprisoned by the memories of the past
That we wish we could forget
We hide the fear inside ouselves
And close our eyes in despair
Defying what was meant to be
Our destiny and inner pain
We take the future in our hands
It will go on, will never end

Searching for another new dimension
A place where we can hide

Together in an endless dream we fly
Alone in the mighty sky
A phenomenon you'd call fiction
But a vision so magic to me
I can see them passing by
Mortals devoured by pain
And the emptiness in their souls
Will they ever find a way?

A way that leads to the gates of the unknown
The key that opens the thousand dreams of yours

Close your eyes and follow the stream
Reality falls down into oblivion
Raise your hands and feel the beauty
Illusions can change themselves into nightmares
Look in the mirror what do you see?
I can see the colours of silence
Deep inside the mysteries of night
You hypnotize yourself in the twilight air

Can you feel the other side
Rising inside your mind
Afraid you fall asleep
You scream you want to hide
Losing all your control
Nightmares grow in your soul
Confused you try to run
Away, you're so alone

Beautiful is daylight
When it breaks upon the sky
It shows the way back to your outer life
Disenchanted you are, but only for the day
The night will soon embrace you
It might be your last play in this world...
