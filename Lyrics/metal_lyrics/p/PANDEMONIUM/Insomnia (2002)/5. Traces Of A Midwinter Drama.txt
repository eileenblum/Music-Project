A pattern composed in the darkest den
Those moments will never be again

Now when the winter has come
Then my memories they guide me to an ancient dimension
A time full of tears
Where the winter-queen showed me the light of deception

Traces of a midwinter drama impossible to erase
Your face so eternal, my nightmares so infernal
A sphere full of pure tyranny
Seduction in fire and darkness
A nymphchild not of this world
Covered with skin like an innocent bride
She is dressed for her pleasures, sin and delight

Have you felt a cold desire?
The beauty in my dreams is the darkest soul, my pain and my disease...

Tears like the purest waters
Frozen in thy eyes
Try to hide the weakness
That dwells behind the grace

When the old man has spoken
All promises are broken
The daylight has fallen into the deepest night
Where thy snake-eyes are watching
Your fingers are touching the skin of the beloved ones

See the queen descending in grace down from her throne
She desolates those weak souls who cross her bloodstained path
Tragedies surrounding the beauty of the night
Frozen are the waters where she seduces the blind

I hear the thousand whispers and screams from the unknown
I feel the mighty presence from the spirits in her gown
Devoured and embraced, I stand alone with fallen grace
The sky is turning grey, I see the bleakness of it all

The waters are turning to frozen ice
I realize it's the tears from a million cries
Those old memories are now fading away
For the last time, the last farewell is said

When the old man has spoken
All promises are broken
The daylight has fallen into the deepest night
Where thy snake-eyes are watching
Your fingers are touching the skin of the beloved ones
My dreams are no longer
My pain growing stronger
I feel the power of the midnight storms
All roses are burning
The flowers are turning
To ice in the presence of her light

I remember the voice in the night
The face is so eternal, but the memory is gone...

Traces [x5]
Of a midwinter drama, Erased!
