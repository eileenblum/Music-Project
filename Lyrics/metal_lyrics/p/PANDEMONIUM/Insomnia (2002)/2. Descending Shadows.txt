Faithless gathered in the pouring rain - a crescendo of voices driven to the edge
Wishing for complete serenity of the mind - a beautiful mosaic missing a piece.

Eternal loss, forever engraved in the soul.
Loveless, lifeless, lustless - Is this what all will become?

I see dark clouds looming ahead on our journey
Is there no end to this search?
Morbid visions of relentless slaughter, frozen tears and pain.
Terrifying destruction, but all in vain...

As dusk falls quiet birdsong echoes in the wind,
Broken by a piercing shriek...
The rising sun disperses mists over a battlefield,
Shines on our epitaph, and we are gone.

Faithless gathered in the pouring rain - a crescendo of voices driven to the edge,
Wishing for complete serenity of the mind.
Stench of decay, emanating darkness allowing no sight
Flickering whispers of madness
And the gathered masses hear the flapping wings of death

Cries of despair echo through the void.
Loveless, lifeless, lustless - Is this what all will become?

I see dark clouds looming ahead on our journey
Is there no end to this search?
Morbid visions of relentless slaughter, frozen tears and pain.
Terrifying destruction, but all in vain...

Despite the strife to erase, unite and pacify, we reach the point of no return.
The rising sun disperses mists over a battlefield, shines on our epitaph, and we are gone.

Sacred visions all depicting unation
Ridiculed or met with derision
Hopefilled prayers of what could have been
Are labeled as insanity
Hope might not yet be lost
All will not have to end
Hearts not yet turned to dust
Will know there is a way

The dawn brings to light a whole new world, shattered and broken
All hopes of a different outcome, have been forsaken
Faithless gathered in the pouring rain - a crescendo of voices driven to the edge
Wishing for an instantaneous relief, with the blackened sky admitting no escape

The last remains, shattered to infinity.
Loveless, lifeless, lustless - Is this what all will become?

The rising sun disperses mists over a battlefield,
Shines on our epitaph, and we are gone.

We're gone...
