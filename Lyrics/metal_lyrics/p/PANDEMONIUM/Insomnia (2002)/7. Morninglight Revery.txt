From the tragedy of reality
Of all that is, that lives to die
The tragedy of you and me
Of your emotions of my cry

Another morning beneath the cold sun
The sun that only I can see
Another morning in hope for euphoria
Where you and I will be

Where you look at me with the same eyes that follow you on
Where you think of me with the same thoughts as those awakening me

Same as those awakening me

From the tragedy of reality
Of all that is, that lives to die
The tragedy of you and me
Of your emotions of my cry

Another morning beneath the cold sun
The sun that only I can see
Another morning in hope for euphoria
Where you and I will be

And I used to ride beyond the horizon
Beyond the cold winds of your voice
Beyond the glaciers of your shoulders
Beyond all boundaries of universe!

Beyond all boundaries of life
Beyond all boundaries of universe
Beyond all boundaries of life!

Where the beauty of a thousand dreams is cast upon me,
Like a tidal wave of gold to reach the shore
Where it feels as if I can't reach any longer
On the edge of all that we can see or touch
Undefinable waters not yet sailed
By intentions that would cause our love to fail.

In diplopia I see what was meant to be
The moon and the stars in the darkened eve
In diplopia I see what I want to see
To rise above the shroud of singularity enforced upon me
The moon and the stars and the sun of thee

But as night turns into morn
And as I turn into me
A dream turns so forlorn
And you turn out to be fantasy
Are those my silhouettes walking by your side?

Are they the ones that seem to be casting shadows in the light?
For long I've known that you are the one
Why won't you see the morning sun?
