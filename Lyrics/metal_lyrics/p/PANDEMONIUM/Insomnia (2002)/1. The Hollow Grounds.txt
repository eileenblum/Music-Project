Kill me now
Pain grows inside
Carnal damnation arise
Devotion untunes my mind

As I step towards the light of deception
My heartbeat finds its pace
To be held high and burned again

The beguiling song of Babylon
Calms my mind to a state of enthrallation
Gods to the sky, grown men will cry
No more will we suffer from this threat of indignation

The deepest thoughts, for the strongest minds
My hollowed soul, marked with the sign of lies
Salvation's the key, to a mutual waste of time
Lionize them all, they'll bring some sunshine in to sacrifice us all

The names have been written on the wall, to stand there forever
Fabrication has deceived us all

The beguiling song of Babylon
Calms my mind to a state of enthrallation
Gods to the sky, grown men will cry
No more will we suffer from this threat of indignation

But still we're standing,
Reaching out helpless, trying to embrace the sky
Rejection of time
Just a quicker path on the big road to die

Dissection of the fate draped red in blood
The darkness will speak the truth again
Finding out that there's nothing left inside
Waiting, 'cause the promises were made

Lightning strikes hard, your time has come
Bury your lies, better not to be found no more
Mysteries lie now ten feet below ground
Let this be your place where you die

Your misinterpretations die with you
A whole population wiped out
No end to the bloodstreams that will flow
From your faith, from your hearts, from your misrepresented minds

Hollow grounds!
