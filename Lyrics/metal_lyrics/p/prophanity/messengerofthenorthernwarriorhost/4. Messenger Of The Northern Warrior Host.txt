[Music:Olsson, Malmstrom / Lyrics:Jarrebring]

The freezing air bites my skin
Riding in the light
Of the crystal fullmoon
The forest gather around me
A horde of wolves
Is following in my footsteps
I plough through the snow
The valley opens wide

I am expected
I am the
Messenger of the
Northern warrior host

They lighten their torches
And turns towards heaven
Summon in sviarnirs tongue
The human sacrifice is given
To almighty Odin
He gives us the sign
As the spear impales the body
The horn is blowing to war
