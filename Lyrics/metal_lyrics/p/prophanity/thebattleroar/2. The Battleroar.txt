[Music:Olsson / Lyrics:Jarrebring]

A thousand shining spears 
Beatings of the wardrums 
Our horde is gathered 
Ready for the battle 
On the other side 
Not far away 
The battletroops 
Of our enemies 

It is freezing cold 
The dawn is near 
The magic red sun 
Is beginning to rise 
It is time for the battle 
It is time for the war 

We bend our bows 
Let's hear the battleroar 
The first sign goes 
The arrows are on their way 
Raising our shields 
It's raining arrows 
Over our heads 
The battle is on 

I love the war 
We raise our swords 
Listen to the great sound 
The battleroar 

I have my faith 
I have my sword 
Meeting in the middle 
The clash of our hordes 

Screams of pain across the field 
Man to man, steel to steel 
Bleeding warriors all over the field 
Warm blood covering the snow 
The war is here, I love the roar
