[Music:Olsson, Blomberg / Lyrics:Olsson]

Behind the horns I stand 
My dear friend, take my hand 
I'll lead you from the light 
Into the darkest night 
Only one way to follow 
Through pain, suffering and sorrow 
Dressed in black and leather we are 
Inverted crucifix and pentagram star 

No books filled with lies 
Open our misleaded minds 
We can only live for ourselves 
Can't believe all that tales 
Together we'll find reality 
The only way to immortality 
Souls of evil will show our way 
Join us or you'll pay
