[Music:Olsson, Blomberg / Lyrics:Olsson]

I'm sitting upon my throne and watch 
The killing of a holy priest 
Laying on his knees and pray 
But I only laugh 
I am taking my crucifix 
My power is now united 
I raise my hand and give the sign 
His death is finally completed 

I shall heal this world 
From all kinds of holiness 
Christianity shall die 
Jesus will never live again 
All preachers shall die 
By my hand 
They will feel my malignity 
When they suffer to death 

Life of an evil kind 
Minds filled with hate 
Naked bodies dancing 
In the light of the moon 
Living in endless sin 
Until the end 
All those who don?t believe 
Shall be layed to rest
