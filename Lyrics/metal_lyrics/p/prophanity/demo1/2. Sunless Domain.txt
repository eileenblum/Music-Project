[Music:Olsson / Lyrics:Jarrebring]

A blaze in my heart 
Like in a forest unknown 
Darkness rules in there 
You are the... one 

Demon lord 
Falling from grace 
We rule this world 
Eternal Darkness 
Is finally here 
Praise the master of hell 

Our time is here 
Show us thy way 
Lucifer in my eye 
Lucifer in my heart 
Thy kingdom come 
Eternal master
