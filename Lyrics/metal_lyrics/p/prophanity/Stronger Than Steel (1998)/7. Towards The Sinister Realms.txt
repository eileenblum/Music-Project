[Music:Olsson / Lyrics:Jarrebring]

Riding across the darkened sky
With my ravens flying above
Seeing things not known to mankind
I'm on my way to the reich of death

On my left I see a world
Here rules the fire and the light
On my right is another world
Here rules the darkness and the ice

In the nine worlds of sorrow
In the nine worlds of death
Rules the mighty mistress of Hel
Queen of melancholy
