[Music:Olsson / Lyrics:Jarrebring]

All dressed up for battle we are
Holding our swords up high
On my shield the sign of Thor
For power and protection in war
I raise my skull to the skies
A sign on the horizon is given
My roots are near
The power fills my heart and soul

I have walked through fire
I have walked through ice
To reach this place
Where proud pagan men
Have stood long before me
It's a wonderful view
I'm summoning you
One eyed old man
With wisdom and strength
With powers of life and death
I'm summoning you
Proud god of all
