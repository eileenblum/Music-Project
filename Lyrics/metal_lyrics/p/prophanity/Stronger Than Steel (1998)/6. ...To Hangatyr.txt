[Music: Magnusson / Lyrics: Jarrebring]

Hung in a tree far above
Bleeding for a heathen spear
Sacrificed to Hangatyr
The wolf's howl, the raven's flee
Screams of anguish
Writhe in despair and fear
Their hopes of an arrival
To the land beyond the ocean

A life on the knees
You're better off dead
Your life is fading
Take your last breath
Call upon the gods
Summon the king of the hanged people
A last wish to enter the mighty halls
Of all the fallen heroes
