[Music:Olsson / Lyrics:Jarrebring]

I'm finally here
At the edge of my life
Sacrificing myself to you
My body is frostbitten and wounded
Bleeding for the christian sword
I lay down my sword
And raise my knife
Summoning you

Take me to the place
Where death is just over night
Where christians never shall rule
My earthlife is over

But I'll live on
In thy mighty halls
A warmth is filling me
From inside

A fire in my heart
Bloodsmell fills the air
Warm blood on my hands
A fall on my knees
Never to rise again
In this feeble earthlife
I'm waiting for
Your valkyries arrival
