[Music:Olsson, Magnusson, Malmstrom / Lyrics:Jarrebring]

The beast of the North
Roars of thunder
The beast of the North
Back from the depths

He is here to conquer
He is here to reign
He is here to slay
He is here to stay

The beast of the North
Is coming to take you
The beast of the north
Is coming to rape you

A more brave warrior
Has never been seen
Led by anger and hate
He fights without fear
Until the last man
Falls to the ground
