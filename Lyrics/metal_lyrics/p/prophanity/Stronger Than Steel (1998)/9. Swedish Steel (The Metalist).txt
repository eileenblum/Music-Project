[Music:Malmstrom / Lyrics:Malmstrom]

Chaos ruled once in time
No life could be found in this world
Set unnamed
No light, no darkness exist
Only a chronology hid and left in time
From this nothingness stars shined
Shined from a heaven on an obscured world
Sunrise and dusk brought forth life
From a crack in the ground
The first man arose, immortal

Time went by and the races grew strong
So strong that even the weak fell to oblivion
Might, intelligence, knowledge and ease
In ancient tales these words shaped his name
Mike is the name the races forgot
And with his wrath he?ll show immense power
So one day he went to where he was born
To prepare this worlds people for their day of doom

Fight with your honour, fight with the swedish steel
They who will crush you, crush them with swedish steel
The heart of your glory shines from the swedish steel
The victory has a banner which spells swedish steel

With five men in follow in leather they all dress
His conquest went to all corners of this earth
No one should elude their music of doom
A music for peoples true hymns disbelief
Mike the Metalist, his accompany him called
And with these he has cleaned the oblivious minds
Their music they all play on top level tenis the music
That once brought Mike his own life

In the castle of stone they all sit
In a circle around a sparkling fire
With beer streaming in their throats
With music of Metal
Their conquest of doom they remember
The tales are some told in mourn, some in delight
When the stories flow from mouth to mouth
At the end of all tales the Metalist stood up
To fill this castle with his wisdom

[Repeat chorus]

"Some of the races stood up for the storm
Proud of the sound when the metal horde tolled
Sad is the fact that most of the battle is an ocean of
Unfaithful desciples,
All men ain't made for Metal
But all Metal is made for men"
