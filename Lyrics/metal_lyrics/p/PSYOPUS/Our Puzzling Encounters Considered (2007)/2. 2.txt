Dear brother symmetry conjoined
like a birth right parasite
our likeness of hearts is far too close
leeching

Chained by life
Chained by life

Dear brother symmetry beside me conjoining,
sustaining the smaller, weaker draining leeches!

God's art
in the form of monsters
God's art
in the shape of two

Sever bonding minds
beyond these cursed parallel souls

You

Head fold dissected
Less parasite extracted
Scars scalpel the tombstone
and leave dear brother symmetry
alone, he haunts our conscience
Leeching my nightmares
