I swear into your eyes with
loving lapse of time we fuck as liars

Imagine nothing more than
you and I and alibis

Lovers hold liars

Be with me when you breathe
In your perfume's liquored stowaway

Be with me when you sleep
With your clandestine heart's imposter
With your clandestine heart's imposter
In your wedding bed

You swore into my eyes listing lustful vows and lies, you
fucking liar
Fucking liar
Liar

I need you more than some
cheap bar room whore's number
Under a matchbook cover does

Forget me not
I remember everything you said
You said you love me
You said you need me

Forget me not
Like scripted lies being well rehearsed
Forget me not
Like lipstick on your collar
Forget me not
like some cheap whore!
Forget me, you fucking liar

You said you love me
You said you need me

Forget me, I'll fucking kill you

You said you love me

Hold me closer, you fucker

I will never leave you
just disclose and betray you
'til' lovers can't believe you
And only I will love you
