Construct this jigsaw
Laced with your true intentions
I can't figure out
Who the hell or
What the fuck we are

What is this?
Love poems with Cupid as a martyr?

Collapse under the crushing wonder
Wonder

Core curiosity
Drives my stomach eating itself alive
Discovering sweet
in the heart of a chameleon
My starving
stomach eats itself alive

this puzzle
Relying on projection
You can't figure out
who the fuck
or where hell we are
or how to even care
