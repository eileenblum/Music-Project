Good bye scissor fuck
Idol paper doll
Stenciled into shape
Loneliness escape
Lies tab fold dress
Decorate your mess
with sparkling fools gold

Heart pit-patter skips
Paper cut my lips to kiss salt

Fuck me, my fake

Your soul spins on axis self centered like a whoring tornado
Your soul spins on axis self centered like a whoring tornado
Tornado

Scissor fuck paper doll
Scissor fuck paper doll
Scissor fuck paper doll
Ripped to Shreds

Like sniffing fairy dust high
to fake the feeling of a rhythm to your folded heart
My big lie

This fog surrounds me
'til I'm choking and desperate
Reaching out to extinguish these feelings
Reaching out to a sincere mirage

Keep stuffing your face
Keep stuffing your face
like a vulture on suicide
Keep stuffing your face

Folding, creasing origami into
dotted line orgasm guide
me falling for this bitch
this drug
this curse
this emptying clasp
this delusion

Your soul spins on axis self centered like a whore

Scissor fuck paper doll
Scissor fuck paper doll
