He sees her. Sees her peeking out
From behind his eyes
He sees Cynthia
Reaching to strip him out
And sculpt her in
Like flesh in drag
Make him beautiful
With the surgeon's magic wand
Make her beautiful
Make him Cynthia
He's beautiful removed
She's beautiful like a mutilated sculpture
Cynthia
He sees her
She's all he's ever wanted
Cynthia
She sees ripping him off of her
