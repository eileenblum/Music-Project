Planted less the sunshine to bloom
Six feet below
Ms Shyflower wears tomorrow's
Funeral
Wake her do wipe the soil from her
Eyes
Eyes only
Only eyes
In their panic
Chased by darkness
Chased by darkness
To see nothing
To see nothing
To see nothing
I'm not dead
I want the sun
I'm not dead
They will walk over to do this
Crushing stone marker
Panic
Scratching away at the lid
Shyflower buried
Thy seed is alive
Shyflower buried alive.
