Smile for the camera
Oh she's crying. Jesus
To the lens focus
Black mascara bleeds her face
Smile for the camera
while you are sliced to ribbons
Scream for the camera
Oh she's pleading. Jesus
For her pathetic life
A starlet with a duct tape smile
Scream camera
Your inspiration focus is a shard in your cunt
Prepare the scene
A method star cured for crucifixion
Play dead
Put on your murdered face
It's only acting. Acting. Acting
Look she's dying. Jesus
Grainy and unsteady
Falling down like a character in hell
Scream!
