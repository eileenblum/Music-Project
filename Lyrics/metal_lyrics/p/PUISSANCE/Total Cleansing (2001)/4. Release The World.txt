Will someone ever love enough to light another star?
All i want is someone to release the world and all the filth we are.
I still believe in one.
Why is it that the truth of today is more valid than the truth of yesterday?
Do people really believe that we have learned enough to even know what truth is?
I know that i myself have no idea, so my bet is that most people are clueless too.
Who decides what truth is? It is really smart to let biased reporters of a market
economy news-selling institution dictate what we shall believe and think?
What kind of qualification do they have to perform their smeared-ink
brainsurgery on the unknowing cretins of modern society?
As far as i know there is no licence required to be a journalist, and they
don't really need any training, as far as i know all you have to be is a liar.

What is truth or common sense? It is just the current media-hype at a factor of ten?
Isn't it a variable that is ever shifting ever changing every couple of years?
Two hundred years ago it was common sense to have slaves, we don't believe
in that now. Fifty years ago or so it was illegal to be gay, and it was legal to rape
your wife, we don't believe in that now either, but if common sense can change that
much in just fifty or two hundred years, what is there to say that it won't change
tomorrow? No-one knows what the truth of tomorrow will be...
But i do know who is going to invent it, and i do know who is going to look back at
the truths of our time and tell us they were lies...
