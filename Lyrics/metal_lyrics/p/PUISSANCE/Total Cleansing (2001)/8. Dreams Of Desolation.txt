Who spawns the dreams of desolation?
we do...
Who writes the epitaph of light?
we do...
Who lies and preaches of condamnation?
we do...
Who clips the wings of angels bright?
we do...
We are all the only one.
We are all the weak and tepid.
We all strive to rule our own world.
We all tie ourselves down.
We all rot in perfect harmony.
We all love to pity yet do nothing.
We all care enough to ignore.
We are all people.
We are all just a disease.
Who spawns the dreams of desolation?
we do...
Who writes the epitaph of light?
we do...
Who lies and preaches of condamnation?
we do...
Who clips the wings of angels bright?
we do...
We are the victims in a conspiracy of nothing.
We are all liars in the end.
We all hold our own ideas as truths.
We all fool ourselves to believe that we really exist.
We all cheat and lie to keep our noses above water.
We all cry at the end of the day.
We all smear our own guilt onto others.
We are all just pawns in a game played by pawns.
Who spawns the dreams of desolation?
we do...
Who writes the epitaph of light?
we do...
Who lies and preaches of condamnation?
we do...
Who clips the wings of angels bright?
we do...
Who spawns the dreams of desolation?

Who writes the epitaph of light?

Who lies and preaches of condamnation?

Who clips the wings of angels bright?
we do...
