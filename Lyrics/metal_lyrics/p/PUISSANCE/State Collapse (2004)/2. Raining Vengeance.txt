Blinded shallow eyes, faulty hollow lies
I will burn a hole in your...
Crippled volatile sucking down the bile
void of all and nothing more
Whore of all and none, texture shifting gone
wipe it clean of all.
Smooth as summer winds, wiping out the sins
like there ever was one more

One day when we least expect it....
a day like any other in our sheltered prepackaged lie
We choke on our morning coffe
It's raining vengeance from the sky

Blinded shallow eyes, faulty hollow lies
I will burn a hole in your...
Crippled volatile sucking down the bile
void of all and nothing more
Whore of all and none, texture shifting gone
wipe it clean of all.
Smooth as summer winds, wiping out the sins
like there ever was one more

Suddenly there is no tomorrow,
Somehow someone took it away.
What are your plans for the evening
What if tomorrow is your last day?

Blinded shallow eyes, faulty hollow lies
I will burn a hole in your...
Crippled volatile sucking down the bile
void of all and nothing more
Whore of all and none, texture shifting gone
wipe it clean of all.
Smooth as summer winds, wiping out the sins
like there ever was one more
