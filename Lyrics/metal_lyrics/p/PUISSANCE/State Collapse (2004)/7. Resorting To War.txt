You say it's self defense, I say it's insane.
You call it freedom, I call it pain.
The labels may differ, but facts will remain.
You're slaughtering children, over and over
and over again.

Worlds only change when we change our own ways
Problems you blame others for are certain to stay.
Resorting to war, a solution for fools.
If you want real change then just bomb your own schools

You say it's an act of war, I say it's a cry for help.
You call it terror, I call it news.
The labels may differ, but facts will endure.
You're lacking two houses, but happily butcher the poor.

Worlds only change when we change our own ways
Problems you blame others for are certain to stay.
Resorting to war, a solution for fools.
If you want real change then just bomb your own schools

You say the world is yours, true but not yours to divide.
You call it's justice, I call it genocide.
The labels may differ, but facts are the same.
You're building the biggest base of enemies and shame.

You say it's self defense, I say it's insane.
You call it freedom, I call it pain.
The labels may differ, but facts will remain.
You're slaughtering children, over and over
and over again.

Worlds only change when we change our own ways
Problems you blame others for are certain to stay.
Resorting to war, a solution for fools.
If you want real change then just bomb your own schools

Worlds only change when we change our own ways
Problems you blame others for are certain to stay.
Resorting to war, a solution for fools.
If you want real change then just bomb your own schools
