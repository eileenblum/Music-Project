There is a strange look of expectations of the faces of the I meet,
There is a building tention in the air, traces of sulphur in the breaths i take.
It seems that something has been growing,  behind our backs for a long long time.
It's war that you taste when you open your mouth, it's the iron of blood 
waiting to be spilled.
It's the winds of revelation that are coming, the storm of armageddon is 
soon to be released.

There is a glow at the horizon, a second sun set in the east.
Still there is hope for a future, pure rid of people at least.
Hope we so secretly carry, that one day we may just  be free.
Free of the lies and the liars, that all that remain is debree.

You may not admit it openly, you may not admit it at all.
But most things in your life are empty, hollow shallow and false.
You might not even fell the longing, to be put out of your misery.
But if you were handed the answer, I'm sure you all would agree

There is a glow at the horizon, a second sun set in the east.
Still there is hope for a future, pure rid of people at least.
Hope we so secretly carry, that one day we may just  be free.
Free of the lies and the liars, that all that remain is debree.

I don't believe it's impossible, I don't think the road is too long.
I'm quite convinced we can bring this, even if most consider it wrong.
As we have said so many times, and history has proven us right.
It only takes but a dozen, to transform day into night.

There is a glow at the horizon, a second sun set in the east.
Still there is hope for a future, pure rid of people at least.
Hope we so secretly carry, that one day we may just  be free.
Free of the lies and the liars, that all that remain is debree.
