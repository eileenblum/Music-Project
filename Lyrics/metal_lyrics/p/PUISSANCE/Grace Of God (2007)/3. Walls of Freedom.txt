Stand before the gates of hell my friend.
Brace yourself before the degradation.
Open your eyes slowly now, they will show you when and how.
Trust me they don't lack tools of persuasion.

Tear down the walls of freedom now.
Let likes of Caesar show us how.
Just like the emperors of past has lead the way,
Better to burn alive than fight another day.

A storm of greed that took away your children.
The winds of freedom swept away your home.
Even though they crushed your dreams, just to fit their thieving scheme.
You will be grateful or alone.

Tear down the walls of freedom now.
Let likes of Caesar show us how.
Just like the emperors of past has lead the way,
Better to burn alive than fight another day.

One day you will praise their foul persistence.
Say your prayer inside your precious cage.
You'll submit to market rules, just another feeble tool,
Forgetting all the decades spent in rage

Tear down the walls of freedom now.
Let likes of Caesar show us how.
Just like the emperors of past has lead the way,
Better to burn alive than fight another day.

Tear down the walls of freedom now.
Let likes of Caesar show us how.
Just like the emperors of past has lead the way,
Better to burn alive than fight another day.
