I left before I should have
I failed to follow through
But venture to the fields of death
And I will walk with you
Together in a tight embrace
We'll cross the bridge of light
Into the land of never-was
Where echoes rule the night.

And all the things you fight for, and the things you hold for true
Won't change the fact we walk towards the end, and so do you
The steps you take so carefully may be big or small
But leads you to the edge and then eventually you fall

I really wish you could have come
But you must stay behind
In a world of dying flesh
Memories in your mind
One last thing I leave you
I really must persist
The hope of a better world
Where death does not exist

And all the things you fight for, and the things you hold for true
Won't change the fact we walk towards the end, and so do you
The steps you take so carefully may be big or small
But leads you to the edge and then eventually you fall

And so I cross the river
Move to the other side
No one left to hold my hand
As is for all who died
But finally I'm not afraid
There's nothing left to fear
And rest assured I won't forget
A single of your tears

And all the things you fight for, and the things you hold for true
Won't change the fact we walk towards the end, and so do you
The steps you take so carefully may be big or small
But leads you to the edge and then eventually you fall

A voice now from the other side
Wishing all the best
For everything and everyone
Eventually we rest
I walked as blind for all my life
Until the veil was cast
That life is truly beautiful
And death will never last

And all the things you fight for, and the things you hold for true
Won't change the fact we walk towards the end, and so do you
The steps you take so carefully may be big or small
But leads you to the edge and then eventually you fall
And all the things you fight for, and the things you hold for true

Won't change the fact we walk towards the end, and so do you
The steps you take so carefully may be big or small
But leads you to the edge and then eventually you fall

[Swedish version:]

[I dÃ¶den]

Nu vet du att jag lÃ¤mnat dig, trots att jag hÃ¶ll dig kÃ¤r,
men kom, i natt, till dÃ¶dens fÃ¤lt, sÃ¥ mÃ¶ter jag dig dÃ¤r.
SÃ¥ kan vi bÃ¥da vandra Ã¶ver ljusets bro,
till landet bortom ingenstans, dÃ¤r nakna sjÃ¤lar bo.

Men du fÃ¥r inte komma, nej du ska stanna kvar,
och bÃ¤ra pÃ¥ mitt minne, det jag lÃ¤mnat har.
Det sista jag kan ge dig, fÃ¶rutom allt du minns:
ett hopp, i all fÃ¶rtvivlan, att dÃ¶den inte finns.

SÃ¥ gÃ¥r jag nu allena till flodens andra strand;
ingen vid mig, lÃ¤ngre, som hÃ¥ller i min hand.
Men jag Ã¤r inte rÃ¤dd nu, fÃ¶r du har lovat mig
att lÃ¤mna mig i visshet om att jag Ã¤lskar dig.

En rÃ¶st, frÃ¥n andra sidan, som Ã¶nskar dig allt vÃ¤l;
fÃ¶r var du Ã¤n mÃ¥ vandra, Ã¤r dÃ¶den hack i hÃ¤l.
En brist hos mig, som andra, det du inte vet:
att livet nog Ã¤r underbart i sin fÃ¶rgÃ¤nglighet.
