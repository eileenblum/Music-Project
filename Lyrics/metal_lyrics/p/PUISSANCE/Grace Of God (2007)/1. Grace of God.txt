The last resort -- arch enemy
I turn to You in desperation
To understand, to set me free
Because I know You feed on desolation
And if you hear me, and I think You do
Won't You just grant me one thing?
To see the stars just one last time
And then go back to silent waiting

The sky is clouded by Your grace
Your sacred earth we desecrate
Supreme above it all, You reign
Please wash away this human stain
The time to crush, to overtake
The very end is still at stake
Won't You end this pointless quest?
And kill the world, then lay to rest?

Whatever I have done, I know that You forgive
This rotting world, ridden with infection
My biggest crime: I really don't want to live
Too much time is spent, on mere deflection
So if you hear my prayer, set the fields ablaze
I only want to gaze upon the sun
You have the power to end the human race
Just one simple wish, let it all be gone

The sky is clouded by Your grace
Your sacred earth we desecrate
Supreme above it all, You reign
Please wash away this human stain
The time to crush, to overtake
The very end is still at stake
Won't You end this pointless quest?
And kill the world, then lay to rest?

Now for the first time, I have heard your call,
and rest assured, you won't go out alone.
But it is time, to leave once and for all.
Too many lies have turned your God's heart into stone.
And I will leave you in fury and with rage
The earth lay sterile, for a while
So will the shadows fall and then it is too late
To think I do all this for a single smile

So the shadows falls...
So the shadows falls...
So the shadows falls...

The sky is clouded by Your grace
Your sacred earth we desecrate
Supreme above it all, You reign
Please wash away this human stain
The time to crush, to overtake
The very end is still at stake
Won't You end this pointless quest?
And kill the world, then lay to rest?

The sky is clouded by Your grace
Your sacred earth we desecrate
Supreme above it all, You reign
Please wash away this human stain
The time to crush, to overtake
The very end is still at stake
Won't You end this pointless quest?
And kill the world, then lay to rest?
