You are the seeds, past through the centuries.
Alleged crimes live through the lies.

Disarray, lead to the war, that leads to blood in the night.
Will demons reach to your world?
Will you cry at the end of your life?

Darkest deception
Reason recital
What you need, when you die in the night.

Repetitive, restless in the night.
Will, what time free this night?
Will, never rise your right?
Will, the demons leave your life?
Will never desecrate
