Coming of a one winged angel nightmare truth returned, 
Feel the discord in my soul misanthropic messiah, 
Distant call beneath the earth last remnants of chaosâ legacy 
Unholy revelations geostigma infected my resolution to sail the darkness of the cosmos 
Resanctify this holy ground, hordes of chaos running loose, 
Wreaking havoc forevermore leaving nothing but an empty ruin, 

Disciples of destruction, forbidden reunion 
Distant struggle for revolution, never ending 
Children of the dawn, a new world order, 
Left with no survivors, eradicate existence, 
Destroy this world, final Armageddon 
Sephirothâs vision, metamorphosis 
Children of Jehovah, baptised in bloodshed all life will end
