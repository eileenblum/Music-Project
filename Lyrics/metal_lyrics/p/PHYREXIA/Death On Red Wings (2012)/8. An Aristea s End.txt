The world has bowed beneath my sword hewn and destroyed, 
Legions of bodies lie at my feet all cut down 
A crimson lake reflects my face 
God of destruction ancient terror final empty victory 

No mercy for the weak fleeing for life, 
Living on battlefields like cattle to slaughter, 
They fall on my blade sacrificed to the god that dwells within my blood 

And so the fight becomes meaningless, 
A pointless struggle no honour, no glory 
In this end the only battle left to fight towards suicide
