1914, bullets fly across the field searching for another unnamed tomb, 
As my soul departs my body, I look back wretched, hated, sum of humankind, 
Conflict has awakened my lust for the sanctuary contained within the omnipresent death, 
Eye for an eye, life for a life I cannot see beyond this rage, 
Bloodlust is consuming dark psychosis eroding all thatâs of shattered reality 
Eye for an eye, life for a life lost in the destruction exalting in obliteration 
Finally free in the act spilling the blood of my fellow man we all die here. 

I must desecrate I must terminate I must desecrate, 
Absolute power bring your fear bring your hate. 
The dead will never rise again, You will never rise again.
