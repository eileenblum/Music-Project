War erupts from the skies bathing the world in flame civilizations collapse, a new apocalypse, 
Godslayer forgotten forsaken annihilation 
The dawn will never come, cancerous religion 
Beyond the catacombs, sword of the ancients, 
Cast relic of chatic uncreation, forged with the last sworn cast down from heaven, 
By obsidian blade, you will see the truth in the lies, 
By obsidian blade, you will see the end of your lives.
