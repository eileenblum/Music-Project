Amongst the forgotten ruins lying bloodied and shackled 
On the barren ground, consumed in the fires of your betrayal 
Demon of the poisoned tongue throughout the ages long 
Sire of mortal tragedy and sorrowâs dark harbinger 
Your deeds carved wounds in the earth and the flesh of innocence 
By blood rites I invoke you hear this hymn of retribution 
Your blood shall quench the land and set my spirit free to walk the path of absolution 

Voices, of the dead calling, out to me 
Brother, betrayed purity, defiled 
I hear your voice from below the grave 
Unbearable was his treachery 
Unrelenting was his venom 
Unending was your suffering 

My brother, can you hear me? 
Your blood cries out from beyond the veil 
My brother, can you hear me? 
I shall be a dagger in the traitorâs heart. 

I shall walk the path of hate this is my vow I will seek vengeance unto my death 

Descent into the twilight this starless and bleak land shadows breeding in the depth 
I see a black mountain breaking the dark horizon by infernos crowned and screams surrounded 
A gateway to infinity imprisoned by a dark fortress driven by winds of wrath and legacies of blood 
I ascend the hidden paths there lies the wretched demon blinded by dread curses 
Chamber covered in sigils an empyrean tomb as I plunge the blade into his flesh searing pain in my chest a demon I am 

My brother, can you hear me? 
Your blood cries out from beyond the veil 
My brother, can you hear me? 
My blood seals the oath of your cursed death
