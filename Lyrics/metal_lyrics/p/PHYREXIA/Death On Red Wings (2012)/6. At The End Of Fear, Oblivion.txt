I lie broken here on this field full of the rotting dead, 
Blood leaks from my wounded chest, the ravens flie above, 
the scavenging carrion come to devour my flesh, 
Once I have seen the darkness descend for the last time 
At the end of fear oblivion 
As the last glow passes out of my eyes I see nothing but an endless void 
Spiralling ever downward into nothingness everything unified by the darkness, 
This cannot be all there is, infinite space of cold emptiness and miserable death
I leave this life by a bitter end, and now I float motionless in a sea of blackest night nthing in sight as I drift 
eternally enclosed by the realms of infinity 

Confined to the paradox of wandering a dead cosmos, 
All my deeds go unpunished no price for the crime of sin no hell or any heaven, sorrow misery and pain 
All now worthless in the end, conscience is all that's left 

Now twilight descends and night is falling fast, 
I don't understand this doom lain before me so many questions to be unanswered, dislodged from any plain of existence, 
I feel the fated blade pierce my ribcage again, 
passing right through my armour there was no endless void 
Was it all an illusion? I can taste the blood in my mouth 
We mortals are but shadows and dust drifting in the sands of time
