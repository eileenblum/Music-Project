Smoke fills the air, scent of cinder is there the ground shakes, the earth quakes 
In desperate fear I stand, a distant silhouette 
Zooming from afar, that visage I shall neâer forget 
A dragon enraged by fire, engulfed in death 
Raging ever higher, light the funeral pyre 
Roarix Bladewing, guide Thy flame come to strike again! 

Sonic boom, sound of thunder 
Lightning flashes, death hereafter 
Rain of blood, smouldering flesh 
Death on red wings, Bladewing forever! 

Ground into dust, humans fall to the ground 
No-one stands against Bladewing the Risen, 
Legendary creature of nightmarish design 
Wherefore didst thou rise again? Necromancy, death in red magic 
Summoned destroyer, demon among dragons wherefore to feast again? 
Strike from the grave leave the living in pain!
