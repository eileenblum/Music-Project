Ancient ritual of deadly design, forged by those with power in mind, 
An ancient sect, wizards of red, all life hangs by a thread, 
Cult of the dragon, cult of the beast, A great colossus long since deceased, 
Sought to revive this deadly creature, little did they know it was ready to feast, 
The magic users fell to their knees, lost their heads, executionerâs fee 
The beast emerged hungry for more, on towards the mountain it roared, 
Blood spewed from all sides, Creature was unstable, ritual had not completed, Bloodfire was imperfect, 

Bloodfire Colossus creature of destiny going to implode going to explode 
Resurrected demon, destroyer of worlds 
Your resurrection is lifeâs destruction. 
Feel the blood boiling see the fire burning creature calling demon roaring

Round and round, gathering more speed, taking many lives, an endless feed 
Flowstone flood, out of control, fuel the fire that was its need, 
Burn the soil and purify the air, Night blazed like a flare, 
Terrifying beast of mass destruction, creature of colossal evil, 
The embers burnt and died, flesh tormented and fried, 
Sooner or later it was going to explode, Bloodfire razed the ground it would not die alone.
