Patterns lull me in to sleep
still I can not reach your keep
My ship lies still upon the sea
and yet no harbour can I see

Sunsweet voices call my name
sweeter pictures calm my shame
Realm of sanctum how I long
to hear your angels sing my song

Ripples on the mirrorlake
dewdrops where the fairies make
Life a part of heavens sake
spring in every breath you take

Skin against my pounding chest
in your arms I'll make my nest
Once I've touched you I may rest
filled with piece and newborn zest

Ripples on the mirrorlake
dewdrops where the fairies make
Life a part of heavens sake
spring in every breath you take
