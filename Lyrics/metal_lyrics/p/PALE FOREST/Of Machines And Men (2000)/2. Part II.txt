Nails scratching wooden surface
Eyes red from tears like blood
Torn hair in clenching fist
A guttural scream from the mouth you kissed

It seems so far away now
just as if it has never been
Seems much clearer somehow
an eye for a lie in every scene

I was so lucky on that day
still I almost let it go
When you went away
what a lucky turn it was for me

Things must work out better the second time around
cause this is beauty I have found
She's breathing in my ear now
what a sound
You are the dead leaves falling to the ground

You mistreated me, never let me be
The lies you told to me I was too blind
to see you
when you were tightening the noose
To see you
you only wanted me to loose
I was so lonely
lonely...

It seems so far away now
