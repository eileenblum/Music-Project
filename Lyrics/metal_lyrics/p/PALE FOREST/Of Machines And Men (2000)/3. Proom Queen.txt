I am so ugly, and it turns me inside out
Queen of the ball, yeah I really have no doubt
you just want to bring me down
to make my moans the only sound
and they have to wear the crown
at last the new fool has been found

I see the wretched creature staring back at mee
from the magic mirror on the wall
I see her pale and disfigured, how could it be?
...cause ugly is me

I am so ugly, and it turns me inside out
the most beautiful of all, yeah I really have no doubt
you just want to bring me down
to make my moans the only sound
for what is underneath my gown
the new found fool will get her crown

I feel it growing inside of me
and I just cant get it out
I feel myself growing ugly
and I wont let you find out

I see the wretched creature staring back at mee
from the magic mirror on the wall
I see her pale and disfigured, how could it be?
...cause ugly is me

All you ever wanted
was to laugh behind my back
when you tried so hard to dazzle me
and get me off the track
