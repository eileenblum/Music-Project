If I say I love you
will you stay or want ot wither, fade away
If I show you the sun and the night of my past
will a smile cross your face but just vanish too fast

In the greener field she lies
the superior being with emerald eyes
Red strand of hair and straw entwined
She's surrounded by utopia
but unable to find

A reason to keep those flaming eyes burning
for darkness blurs her yearning
She feels the tides have stopped their turning
and beauty only lives in death

I hear you singing in my dreams
awaken to your silent screams
I see you dancing on the line
of sorrow versus joy divine

In the greener field she lies
the superior being with emerald eyes
Red strand of hair and straw entwined
She's surrounded by utopia
but unable to find

A reason to keep those flaming eyes burning
for darkness blurs her yearning
She feels the tides have stopped their turning
and beauty only lives in death
