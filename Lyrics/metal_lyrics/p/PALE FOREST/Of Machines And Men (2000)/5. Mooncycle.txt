one two three four five six seven eight
don't you know it's all to, all to late
nine ten, lion's den, sell the hide, suicide
come with me, you will see
how it's all supposed to be

Shapes of fire, blinding light
Step into the ring tonight
Join us in our song of longing
for a shape of greater might

We praise the moon
you join us soon
We chant for heaven
to fall onto earth
under a bright full moon

When the light fades, take my hand
Join the chant and understand
Like a whisper in your ear
they are waiting
they are here

Shapes of fire, blinding light
Step into the ring tonight
Join us in our song of longing
for a shape of greater might

We praise the moon
you join us soon
We chant for heaven
to fall onto earth
under a bright full moon
