Did you know?
while you were sleeping I was not
Did you know?
I couldn't sleep cause of the things you never said
I waited for so many nights to hear you say
how every road I walked became the wrong way

When I tried to get to you
I tried to reach the inner child
All those times I tried to hold you
left me feeling we had died
we had died

Did you know?
when we fought last night I knew
that the blame was really mine this time
I tried to make you show me
a hint of what you tried to hide
turne the tide

When I tried to get to you
I tried to reach the inner child
All those times I tried to hold you
left me feeling we had died
we had died
