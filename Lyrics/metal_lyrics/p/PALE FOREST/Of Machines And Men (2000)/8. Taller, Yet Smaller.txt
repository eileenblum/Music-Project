Strange is how I truly feel
when I watch the world outside
Everything appears unreal
with nowhere left to hide

When I was younger the light in my room
would stay on with the light of the moon
Now the comfort I had in such things
is broken and so are my wings

Afraid is what I truly am
of nothing and all there is
Wouldn't help me if you gave a damn
wouldn't bring me bliss

When I was younger the light in my room
would stay on with the light of the moon
Now the comfort I had in such things
is broken and so are my wings
