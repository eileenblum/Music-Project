I know what youâve done righteous mister hunter
I know what has become of you and the fox
I ainât happy with you, not at all satisfied
I feel the need to scroll holes into your head

Abra cadabra all ethics and morals out the window

So you caught the fox
Know what it means?
The stain of border crossed
Became your prize to keep

I know what you are
