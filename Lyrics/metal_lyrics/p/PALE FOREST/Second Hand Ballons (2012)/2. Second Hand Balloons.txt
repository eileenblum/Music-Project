Let me tell you all about a man just down the street
Heâs wearing second hand balloons and cardboard on his feet
Telling wicked stories
He laughs with nervous friend
Heâs really quite amusing when your life goes down the bends

Let me sing a song for you of little lady lay
She goes with anyone she meets
Sheâll go with you one day
And if the lord would come to her sheâd follow him for sure
But he has never asked her out or offered her a cure

Soothing
Let the ever eluding rust soothe you, my friend

Let me walk a while with you and watch the rain come down
On every little print I make upon the soggy ground
Iâll tell you that thereâs no excuse for feeling left behind
To make this circle spin around I guess our teeth must grind

Soothing
Let the ever eluding rust soothe you, my friend
