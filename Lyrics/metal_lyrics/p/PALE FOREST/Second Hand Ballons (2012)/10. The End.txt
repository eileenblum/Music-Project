Sinking to the level between
This room and all the places that we've been
I breath behind the walls and this door
and all the things I used to be before.

What you are.

Smiling by the touch of your skin,
I have to end before I can begin.
I leave you by these walls and this door
and all the things I used to be before

What you are.

What you're looking for.
I won't beg more
Awake all night,
I'll lose this fight.

What you are.

So this is where I leave you, my friend,
This is what I'd like to call the end.
