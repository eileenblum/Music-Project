Mosquito swarm under my skin
Drooling old man on the pyre within
The hall is empty but itâs never quiet
Youâre a better man than I Mr. Sin

But I wanna be new
Try to fill the holes in my head
New. Let them drown the old instead
New. Try to separate the good from the bad
New. Throw away all the feelings Iâve had for you

My head is painted with the words of your call
I see the shadow of a noose on the wall
I have to kill you or Iâll die instead
A million pieces of my disco ball
