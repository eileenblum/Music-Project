I might be mad
The days have no end
I might be lost cause I keep missing a beginning of everything

I might be sad
I canât get enough
I might be lost cause I am shrinking

So am I nothing or am I all?
Am I the resurrection or am I the fall?

I might be mad
I think Iâm the one
I might be lost cause I keep thinking Iâm nothing and everything
