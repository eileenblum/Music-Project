Iâd like to be a silent fly on your wall
Reveal your tendencies to know it all
Iâd like to hear it when you call me names
And to be a poison you drink from my veins

Iâd like to be a little twist of your tongue
Make all your sentences come out wrong
Iâd like to be a worm under your skin
And to fuck you up from deep within

Cause my name is envy the yellow fever
Myself I worship
Iâm a believer

Yeah, you smile at everyone just like on TV
Why canât you leave and be gone?
I just want them to see me

Iâd like to be a hair in your hundred-dollar soup
Iâd like to be a chair with an electrical loop
Iâd really like it if you sizzled and burnt
Iâd really like for you to see how I have yearned

I breathe, I breed

I just want you to see me.
