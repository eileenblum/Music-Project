Stick to one like old man Drake
He poured lemonade and made a cake
Served it to the princess upon her happiest of days

They were a signal, a beacon through space
He dared to fly above the maze
High enough to win that single pearl

Where ever you may see him
There is where sheâll be
His little jar of honey
Heâs not afraid of the stinging bees

They were a grain, a child in the womb
All of their days he gently crooned
Only one, my only one

Where ever you may see him
There is where sheâll be
His little jar of honey
Heâs not afraid of the stinging bees
