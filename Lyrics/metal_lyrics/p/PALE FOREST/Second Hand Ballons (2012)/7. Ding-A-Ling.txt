Shadows in my head again
Too far from you bed, my friend
I stand on shaking shoes
And Iâll never be of much use

Counting toes beneath the table
The rain will flow when they are able
To fly this low to get me
And Iâll never be of much use

Foghorns blowing from the bar
The sky reveals a lucky star
For everyone but I
And Iâll never be of much use
