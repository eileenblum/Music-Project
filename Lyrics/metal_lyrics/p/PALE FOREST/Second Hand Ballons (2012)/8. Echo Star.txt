While youâre moving through the show
While youâre letting no one know
That somewhere thereâs someone no one loves
Who lives inside the goddess they behold

While they cling to you like snow
While youâre slowly letting go
Knowing you will fade but always be
The only image they could ever see

You give life to the twinkle in their eyes
You give meaning where all reason dies
Youâre just like the echo of a falling star
Shining still cause they canât see that far

While you vanish they become
While you choke they take breath one
And youâre the dream to bring them to the source
A saviour on the quickest horse
