Broken words lay on the floor
Lines I cannot fix
Thoughts that were, but are no more forgotten in the mix

And all my great designs, theyâre fade
Like butterflies in frost
Dead souls gasping for more air long after life is lost

I wonder if they breath on planets far away
Technicoloured beauties

A sentence spoken in a dream will vanish when I wake
Leaving just the melody of its sweet refrain
Like plans you made when you were young that never came to be
But still would be your favourite song if capture by your ears

I wonder if they live all those hopes and dreams
In a secret place
I wonder if they breath on planets far away
Technicoloured beauties
