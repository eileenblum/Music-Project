[L.M. Jenssen / J. Hagen]

Smoother surface than before 
eyes set to a different shore 
But what of that which lives within this face 

Sweeter scent than before 
renewed temptation, open door 
But what of that which stirs inside this body 

My colours have faded to gray 
I know 
Inside I feel the same 
You've left to see a fresher show 
To burn another flame 

Warmer weather than before 
storming fire now in store 
But what of the lightning we made 

My colours have faded to gray 
I know 
Inside I feel the same 
You've left to see a fresher show
