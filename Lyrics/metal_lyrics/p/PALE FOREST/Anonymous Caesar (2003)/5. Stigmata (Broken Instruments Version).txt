[L.M. Jenssen / E. Brox]

When I was down, you were up 
never feeling the pain at all 
When you were down, you kept shut 
all the doors that made you small 

Held your hand 
thinking I was quite the man 
to feed your soul 
I couldn't see you running empty 

I was digging in your sores 
scarred myself inside the source 
The wounds appearing with the tries 
Made me feel like Jesus Christ 

Some of the fears we made leave 
left me thinking you heard my call 
Somehow that made me believe 
all the bricks in your wall would fall 

Gave myself 
a place upon the highest shelf 
and for that sin 
I'll always be condemned within 

I was digging in your sores 
scarred myself inside the source 
The wounds appearing with the tries 
Made me feel like Jesus Christ 
now I pay the price
