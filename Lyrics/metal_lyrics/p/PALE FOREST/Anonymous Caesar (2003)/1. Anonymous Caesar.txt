[L.M. Jenssen / J. Hagen]

Swipe the jelly glass clean 
I thougt I might let it all blow over 
We can talk about anything else 
I assume the matter is too delicate 

He's passing it over now 
with his standards of professional confidence 
The AA meeting is buzzing 
his collegues are compassionate people 

Stick your leg out 
the papers have been put away 
pieces of mind 
stacked under his chesterfield 

The hat sticks to his forehead 
he leaves for his usual afternoon conference 
Knowing how to speak to offenders 
they'll be ready for his imminent summoning 

Stick your leg out 
the papers have been put away 
pieces of mind 
stacked under his chesterfield
