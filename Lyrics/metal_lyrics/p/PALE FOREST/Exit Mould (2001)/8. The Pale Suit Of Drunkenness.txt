Got that feeling of standing still 
the shudder of winters coming chill 
Got that distance in my eyes 
frozen paintings of all my alibies 

And I've got the urge to leave this room 
but it has become my home 
In this dark and familiar gloom 
my features are turning to stone 

Slowly 
holy 
intoxicating love 
takes hold of me 
while I survive another one 

Got those pale trousers warming my will 
they keep me from standing to still 
Got that pale jacket clinging to me 
I just know that I'll never be free 

And I've got the urge to undress myself 
but I dare not show my skin 
Cause this damp and familiar gloom 
has become what I am within 

Slowly 
holy 
intoxicating love 
takes hold of me 
while I survive another one
