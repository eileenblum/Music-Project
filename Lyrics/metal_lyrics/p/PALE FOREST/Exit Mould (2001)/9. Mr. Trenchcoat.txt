Hey mister trenchcoat 
what gray weather were having 
Hey mister sad thought 
I sometimes wonder were youre going 

Hey mister trenchcoat 
what illusions do you carry 
Hey mister un-bought 
is this truly necessary 

Cause you're always out when the rain is pouring from the sky 
your garments hanging down from shoulders pulled up high 
And you always seem to know exactly where youre going to 
as if here among the shadows there is always work for you to do 

Hey mister trenchcoat 
yes we have met 
Hey mister trenchcoat 
I know you're really Mr. Death 

You hide from us 
turn your face away 
I think you don't want us to see you 
but you know that I do 

Cause you're always out when the rain is pouring from the sky 
your garments hanging down from shoulders pulled up high 
And you always seem to know exactly where youre going to 
as if here among the shadows there is always work for you to do
