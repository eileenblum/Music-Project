The hour of souls is the night by your side 
the whisper of angels, your breath 
I sleep behind the moon 
with your slender hand in mine 

The ceiling is gone 
above me spins the spiral shaft 
spinning round and round 
above me spins the spiral shaft 

The first day of spring is the light in your eyes 
the core of the fire, your voice 
I walk on the surface of the sun 
with your slender hand in mine 

The ceiling is gone 
above me spins the spiral shaft 
spinning round and round 
above me spins the spiral shaft
