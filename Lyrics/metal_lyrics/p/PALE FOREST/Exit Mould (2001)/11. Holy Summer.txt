Would you like to be 
on the moon with a spoon? 
I don't care how 
I just want you to tell me something new and terrible 

Isn't he beautiful 

You can drive me in your car 
It won't matter where we go 
This habit for my rose 
This habit for my rose 
I lost my radio phone 

Mr. Rainout 

Electric toys for you 
Funeral so good 

How? 

Isn't he beautiful 

Well, I dig my own dinner in a fancy restaurant 
This car by the sea 
I don't have so much to give 
I'm going to wear my clothes 
I'm going to wear my clothes 

Mr. Rainout 

Would you like to be 
on the moon with a spoon?
