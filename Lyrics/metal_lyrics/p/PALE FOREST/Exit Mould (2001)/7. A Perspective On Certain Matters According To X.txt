Mr. man on the moon 
do you own a fishing pole 
I would surely take your bait 
into my mouth 

and feel you tugging at me 
just maybe I would try to escape or tease you for a while 
then I would let my self go 
fly into your basket 

Now the world is spinning faster than the wheel in my head 
think I heard a new disaster in the things that you said 
I could see them in the window, I could see they were three 
my reflection in the mirror said 
No, I am just me 

So, little lady of the lake 
do you own a pretty pipe 
I would gladly light it for you 
and taste your sweet tobacco 

feel it fill me with calm bubbles 
maybe we would have to hold our heads above the water 
or the stinging soap 
would get in our eyes 

Now the world is spinning faster than the wheel in my head 
think I heard a new disaster in the things that you said 
I could see them in the window, I could see they were three 
my reflection in the mirror said 
No, I am just me
