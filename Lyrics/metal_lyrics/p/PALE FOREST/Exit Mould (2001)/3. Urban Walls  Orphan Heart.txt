Wait for me 
don't walk away on hasty feet 
listen to me 
before you go on down this street 

Angry one 
the neon lights are red tonight 
Father's son 
turning love into a fight 

The mist of this city fogs your mind 
you appear like the man you left behind 
It's just a small crack in our trend 
nothing's really broken, friend 

Come with me 
I hold the key to this garden 
Let me be 
the one to beg your pardon 

Lonely one 
trusting me can't be that hard 
When I'm gone 
I'll be a flower in your yard 

The mist of this city fogs your mind 
you appear like the man you left behind 
It's just a small crack in our trend 
nothing's really broken, friend
