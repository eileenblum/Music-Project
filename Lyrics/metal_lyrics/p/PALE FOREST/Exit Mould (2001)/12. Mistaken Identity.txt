Son, it's never as it seems 
the flowing of the silver streams 
Where people laugh and smile and say 
no day is as beautiful as today 

I wear the mask of perfection 
whenever their heads turn my way 
Clutched in the embrace of rejection 
in a room where I must stay 

In hiding 
It's where I keep my dreams alive 
residing 
It's the only place where I can survive 

Even my mother never knew 
that the face she saw was never true 
In my room there lives no friend 
for whom I must pretend 

My gleaming mask upon inspection 
is where a hundred diamonds lay 
and no one sees the true reflection 
where every stone is grey 

In hiding 
It's where I keep my dreams alive 
subsiding 
to my place in their hive ...
