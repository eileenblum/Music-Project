Big screen 
Wide promises 
not worth keeping 
Would you even think of how I felt 

In the dark 
your hand in mine 
not worth the weeping 
Your hand on my chest 

That big old ship sinking 
like you and I 

Let's call it over 
let's call it over now 
let's call it over 

Walking home 
your biggest show 
not worth a night sleeping 
Our arms entwined in life 

That big old ship sinking 
like you and I
