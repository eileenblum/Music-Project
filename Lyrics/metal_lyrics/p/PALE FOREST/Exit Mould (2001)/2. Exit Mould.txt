Once again surrounded by moving walls 
vacating the innermost of human halls 
Searching, I'm heading for the light 
Walking closer without fright 

Whats that? 
A tricle, a shiver down her spine 
Erase memory 
be divine 

Why do you remain silent 
brother? 
Why don't you speak your mind 
sister? 
Why walk the path of shoulders cold? 
Exit mould 

I'm here again, among trees and green meadows 
and people in countless rows 
Searching, I tread the paths in need of light 
embracing everyone in sight 

Whats this? 
A story of feasts and wine? 
Erase memory 
be divine 

Why do you remain silent 
brother? 
Why don't you speak your mind 
sister? 
Why walk the path of shoulders cold? 
Exit mould
