No one had taken notice of her smile 
No one had spotted her tears 
No one had deemed her good or vile 
No one had calmed her fears 

But she brought me a golden heart 
on a velvet chain 
You know we'll never be apart 
or experience pain 

She whispered 
Never be apart 
Never going back to the start 
Experience pain 
never again 

No one had taken notice of my smile 
No one had spotted my tears 
No one had deemed me good or vile 
No one had calmed my fears 

But her blood lives inside me 
in every vain 
She shows me what I can not see 
keeps me sane 

She whispered 
Never be apart 
Never going back to the start 
Experience pain 
never again
