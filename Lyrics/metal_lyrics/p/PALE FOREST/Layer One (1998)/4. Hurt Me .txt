Your liquid eyes 
where reason dies 
are pulling me 
into the sea 

Your passion for 
what you adore 
will be my guide 
to suicide 

When you clench your fist 
consumed by the mist 
When you're stuck in the haze 
and bring sorrow to my gaze 
you own me 

Why can't you just be 
Angel put your arms around me 
Why can't you see 
your hurting me 

Your need to own 
what you can only loan 
will cause me to 
give myself to you 

Why can't you just be 
Angel put your arms around me 
Why can't you see 
you're hurting me 

I can't deal with being free 
just hurt me
