Nestled up inside 
chrysalis is warm 
Feeding in my hive, soon I will be gone 

But, years have gone by 
and the walls are still to strong 
Embraced in claustrophobic care 

Safe, and with my belly full 
I face each day with glee 
cause this will be the day when she might set me free 

And when the walls still won't give in 
I slowly start to dread 
that for another night or two 
cocoon must be my bed 

Squirming worms inside 
Chrysalis is worn 
old man in his hive, permanent unborn 

The walls are cracked, the egg is hacked 
but now I am to weak 
I can't get out through paper walls 

Safe, and with my belly full 
each day I twist and bend 
cause this will be the day when everything will end
