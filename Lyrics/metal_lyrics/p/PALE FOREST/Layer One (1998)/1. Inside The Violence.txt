Once forever 
in without 
Flow the magma 
from the sun 

Solitaire I am within 
I'm forever only 
but I want to fade away 
Never could I be as lonely 
...and everlasting 

Beautiful be all that I see, I smile to the rain 
Beautiful black, mourning free 
I hurt again 
I shed my tears only for me 

I know I am really nothing 
I know my true pain 
The gleaming needle is 
my only true gain 
...forever laughing 

and I cry magma die
