In my garden, among the trees 
runs a river, ten foot deep 
in it lies a hundred tears 
In my garden, among the trees 

In my dreams, among the ruins 
of past and present fears and lies. 
I dance on air, among the trees 
In my dreams, among the ruins 

Swallow all my well meant faults 
let me from the darkness vault 
I am fading, paint me back 
resembling shadow black 

As the cold veil of white erases every trace 
the raptured remnants of summer leaves 
Gone without a single word or phrase 
are all the colored autumn leaves 

In my ashes dwells no soul 
it has flown to behold 
Father, son, young and old 
In my ashes dwells no soul 

In forever I am tall 
flowers breathe, large and small 
feed on water, feed on all 
In forever I am tall 

Pride yourself to have me known 
I am in the picture shown 
Resembling shadow tall 
not fading, I am all
