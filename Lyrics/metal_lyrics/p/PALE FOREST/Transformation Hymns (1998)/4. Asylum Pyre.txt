Conscience has me easily disturbed 
the moving things around me makes me weep 
Why can't they stop so I can see them properly? 
It makes me wonder if I'm slightly in daze 

My hands are thrown into a great fire 
My inner ear is singing 
singing like a huge church choir 

Decomposition of my eyes won't help my vision 
this isn't quite as funny anymore 
Corpsepaint isn't really necessary 
I haven't got a pulse anyway
