Sunken are the eyes of my creation 
into a glass containing smelly puss 
Whatever sense of gratitude I may have felt 
It went away too soon 

He was your son, I was your daughter 
and the dream would last a million years 
Embraced by the song of a million weeping strings 
and all forgotten things 

The wheel was my father's 
and mine was the stick 

If you ask who made the castle crumble 
and who is left to blame 
I guess my answer to your question 
will most surely be 

He played his strings through me 
revealed my symphony 

The wheel was my father's 
and mine was the stick
