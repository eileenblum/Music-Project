[pt. 1 symbiosive]

What is one without the other? 
nigh5t to feed the light of day 
Like a child deprived of mother 
ears to hear and tongue to say 

What is dry if wet was never? 
evil feeds onwhat is good 
Like a fish on land forever 
understand the understood 

Why does it feel like I'm fading 
and why is that every time I try to make contact 
they turn the other way? 
What is the true code of behaving 
when the minds aren't true to the words that they say? 
...I don't know 

What am I without my sorrow? 
darkness does contain my soul 
Like the cries of pain I borrow 
The exit I enter, where is my soul? 
The exit I enter, where is my soul? 

[pt. 2 not much]

Don't you think the time has come to look back? 
To see what you have done, and what waits up the track? 
Don't you think the time has come, to realise your dreams? 
before the one track mind becomes the cracking of the seams 
When your the eyes become sore from the hourglass sand 
When your tears are no more, together with your promised land
