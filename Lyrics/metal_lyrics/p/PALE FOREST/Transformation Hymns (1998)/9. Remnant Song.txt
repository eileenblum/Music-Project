In tune, the final June 
the oceans overflow 
Deranged, the deserts range 
to mankind's final show 

So soon, the final goon 
the darkest hole is full 
Insane, collect in vane 
The finest carven scull 

...and bones are all 
nothing is left 
The waves still fall 
and bones are all 

Why run from skeleton 
the fallen Mother earth 
All gone, the final son 
and death to follow birth
