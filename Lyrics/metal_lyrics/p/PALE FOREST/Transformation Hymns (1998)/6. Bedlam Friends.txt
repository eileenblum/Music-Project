I'm clinging to the red drapes 
while listening to eaten tapes 
The footsteps booming in my ear 
every second a hundred years 

The walls are tall and white 
plenty of room to fly my kite 
My skin is slick and yellow 
I can see you little fellow 

Little insect on my pillow 
you may try to run away 
But the birds up in the willow 
will eat you up if you don't stay 

I have a little friend in you 
and I know you like me too 
Crawling beneath the yellow sheets 
caressing me with all eight feet 

Little insect on my pillow 
you may try to run away 
But the birds up in the willow 
will eat you up if you don't stay
