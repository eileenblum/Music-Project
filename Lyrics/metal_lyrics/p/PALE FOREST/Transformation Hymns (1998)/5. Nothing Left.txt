All good things have ended now 
my voice no longer speaks out loud 
I'm silent and cold within 
my options silenced by your skin 
Wrapped me in your deadly sins 
for I am the one who's line is thin 
I've begged for you to leave me be 
I've begged for you to set me free 

I won't leave you alone 
you whisper, and your breath is sweet 
You are mine to the core of the bone 
You are mine, head to feet 

I'm stranded in the corner now 
you stand above me tall and proud 
I'm drooling and spinning around 
tried to get out, but somehow found 

Your bars are in my window 
Your hands are on the knob 
Your voice inside my head 
Your coldness in my bed 

I am left here on my own 
still you have not left me alone 
Your ghost is in my pathway 
Your words are in my telephone 

I won't leave you alone 
you whisper, and your breath is sweet 
You are mine to the core of the bone 
You are mine, head to feet
