Lies!" claimed the liar 
when truth had widened every eye 
History re-written 
once the false was told "goodbye!" 

Alone, the once proud shape now stands 
in the shadows of regret 
Onto his trembling hands 
tears are flowing, fate is set 

Lost in the hole she had designed 
for someone else to fall into 
Swallowed by the images 
of a consciousness denied 

The old colossal birds 
conscious of their might 
Soaring to the sky 
aware of every lie 

But soon his lies were told again 
from darkness he was free 
Told to every foe, and friend 
...once again
