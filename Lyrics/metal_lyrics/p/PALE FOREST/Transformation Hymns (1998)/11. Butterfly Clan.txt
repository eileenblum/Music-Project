When we were young and regarded the world with hope 
we came to feel pretty soon the burning of the rope 
The cosmos grew far too vast, our faces turned to stone 
engraved by sleepless nights and the chilling of the bone 

We turned to the wings on the soft summer breeze 
small butterflies 
Melting all hearts disillusion tried to freeze 
small butterflies 

Like the old Stonehenge rocks 
our circle praised the sun 
A huge canvas to warm us by the golden goddess spun 

We turned to the wings on the soft summer breeze 
small butterflies 
Melting all hearts disillusion tried to freeze 
small butterflies
