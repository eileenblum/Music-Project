Crystal wings on angel backs 
descending far above our tracks 
Puny minds beneath their lives 
A flight of glory over star encrusted skies 

Drift into obscurity's passage 
where silence is all 
Drift into obscurity's passage 
where silence is all 
where nothing is all 

And no one below knows where the truth lies 
Nothing really fades and nothing really dies 
From child to senile, from senile to child 
Unbreakable circle, the river running wild
