Peeling off her coat again 
winter turns and goes to rest 
Birds encircle treetops green 
summer brings the final test 

Sunshine bring me transformation 

Shedding skin you live my friend 
plunged into the mud they left 
When they run away, you scream 
king of kings, and king of theft 

Sunshine bring me transformation 

Sunshine warming all but one 
I feel his hand so cold in mine 
Sleeping in the needle dream 
draped in soil sublime 

Sunshine bring me transformation 

When winter speaks I dream of warmth 
when summer comes I sigh 
Cause cold is still my frozen soul 
for change is live and die 

Sunshine bring me transformation
