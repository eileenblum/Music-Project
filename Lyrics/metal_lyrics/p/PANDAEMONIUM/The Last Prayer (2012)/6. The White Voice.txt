I hide my tears in the rain,
In a song, in a smile
I hide my face in my hands,
I hide my agony

Children bought and raped by
A damned church
Money in exchange of white voices
Trading human beings like things

The white voices

I hear your voices, I hear your laments
Victims of a cruel institution
I'll never forget

Children bought and raped by
A damned church
Money in exchange of white voices
Trading human beings like things
