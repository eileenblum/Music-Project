The battle fires burning bright
The blades are swinging side to side
Your end is coming down tonight
You can't escape from me

And as I grab my spear
I can see clearer through the mist
I shoot straight into the seal
The magic shield disappear

And the sun is rising back

Through the wind
And the sun is rising back
Trough the wind

Fear, fear is in his eyes
He doesn't know what's in my mind
I run like a shooting star
And I'm right in front of him

His eyes are like a black abyss
his body heavier than stone
I don't fear the Dark Lord
I know I am the chosen one

And the sun is rising back

Through the wind
And the sun is rising back
Trough the wind

Don't be afraid it's time to die
"You're just a fool and you will cry"
The stars are burning by my side
The fires are blowing from the fight

No one can see who's going down
The Lord is lying on the ground 
Dead!

And the sun is rising back
Trough the wind

What you're waiting for?
