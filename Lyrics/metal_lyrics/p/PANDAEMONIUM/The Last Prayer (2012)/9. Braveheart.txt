Heart, water, wind, fire

The world of the liars is so far away from my heart

Now you remember the world of your great lord
Respect to the world of the fairys dying

Braveheart you fight for the world of the fairys dying
Blade and fire, now is time to fight

Now I can ask to my blade and my hand
To defend your reign, against the enemy

Braveheart you fight for the world of the fairys dying
Blade and fire, now is time to fight

Now I can fly in my sky
And remember the reason of my life

Welcome to the world of the fairy and the elements
Welcome to the world of the glory and pain...
