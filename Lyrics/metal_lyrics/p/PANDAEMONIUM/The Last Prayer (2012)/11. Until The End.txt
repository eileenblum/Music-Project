Now I fight for eternal glory,
search the truth in all my stories
Find the dark in my heart and body,
see the light and follow the glory

See the light for the eternity
And follow your heart until the end

This world is dying for the indifference and hate
It cry like a children sad, cry and pray the moon
The stars suffer for all

silence

Bow to your lord of the dark and pay for all your crime

I'm the water that wash your sins, purify your body and your soul

Now I search the truth in my heart forever
Defender of my fairy land
The magic smile to me, the justice is for all
