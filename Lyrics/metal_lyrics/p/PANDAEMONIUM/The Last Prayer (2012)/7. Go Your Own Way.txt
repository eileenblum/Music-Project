Oh my angel, guardian of my pain
Oh my angel save me from myself

Fetch me the happiness I left in the oblivion of an 
Ancient and unknown word
This wind will bring rain, this earth will bring fire
This time will bring death, this tears will bring pain

I can't save the world, I can't save myself
I can't dry a tear of children crying
Eyes full of tears, eyes full of terror, eyes full of sadness
Eyes without hope for the world

Go, go your own way
Go, your own way, follow your destiny

Don't be afraid of my face, follow me in the dark
And listen to my voice
Follow me in the night, follow me in the sky
Follow me in the future of your life

Go, go your own way
Go your own way, fallow your destiny

Guide me though the just, through the ages
Through the past, in the blue, in the tear of child dying
This is my tragedy
