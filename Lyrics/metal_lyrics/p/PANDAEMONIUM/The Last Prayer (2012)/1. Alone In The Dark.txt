Here I stand waiting under the moonlight
Hidden behind the trees and the snow
I listen to each noise and watch every movement
Again and again, again and again

Alone in the dark I have to keep on
Smelling the night and see where they are
The only path that leads to our land must be
Under control, under control

Father, I don't fear the Kings of New World
Here I stand waiting not trembling anymore
Something has changed in the air of the night
Father, I know they are here right by now

I grab my trusted sword
I'm ready

I see the stars burning bright in the sky
Alone, alone in the dark
I hear them marching
Gods of war
Alone, alone in the dark

I sneak through the army of horses and knights
Friend of thee shadow lead by the stars
I have to find the Lord of New World
And hit in the back, hit in the back

Now I can see him, he's running unconscious
He will taste the kiss of death
I raise my sword and jump to his neck
An invisible power pushes me back

They found me out
I'm not safe anymore
They're gazing at me the Kings of New World

I see the stars burning down the sky
Alone, alone in the dark
I hear them screaming
For my blood
Alone,alone in the dark

I traveled miles
Tonight the time is right to die
I won't survive
I'll die

I see the stars burning bright in the sky
Alone, alone in the dark
I hear them marching
Gods of war
Alone, alone in the dark
