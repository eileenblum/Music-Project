I see with your eyes
I feel your pain
The scars of your skin
The sorrow of your sacrifice

Don't let the grief take you away
Take my life and save yourself
My heart is lost without you
Don't leave me in agony

I see with your eyes
I feel your pain
The scars of your skin
The sorrow Of your sacrifice

I'll flying again on your wings
With you in the sky

Without fear, without pain
We'll fly under the rain

I'm lost in the pain of your sacrifice
Give me your final breath

Let's leave it in the hands of God
Don't be afraid of the storm
Dragon say goodbye to your warrior
You draw to an end

I'm afraid to leave without you
I'll never see you fly again
I'll never see your eyes
I'll stay with you in my mind

I'm lost in the pain...

Let's leave it in the hands of God...
