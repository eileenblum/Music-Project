Today
Today the nightmares are fading away
I'll find what we use to foresee
And this words will be my last breath
I'll never gonna have you again
I'll never have you again

I fell in love with the power of night
She was my savior my wrong advice
Together we're drowning deep in the dark
Holding our hands as we reach the final path

I can see the end
I will wait no more

And the pain will grow

Today the nightmares are fading away 
I'll find what we use to foresee
And I'll be your voice
I will wait no more

Now that I master the power of night
The witches are coming for the ancient rite
I enter the Tower of Fears in the dark
I sit on my throne as the sabbath starts

Stars are falling from the sky
Burning bright before my eyes
The Black Lord rising from the dark
I'm the chose one
Born to shine

The Dark Lord now is here

Today the nightmares are fading away
I'll find what we use to foresee
And I'll be your voice
I will wait no more

Tell me what I have to do
And I will serve you soon
Now we can reach what we use to dream

'cause I'll burn the sky
And we we'll never die
The world will bow and fall
And we'll take control

Stars are falling
