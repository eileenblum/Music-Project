Tower of fears
Now that I'm here
I am feeling like I'm born again
And I hear
The calling of my race
They want me to strike back

And I'm hungry for blood

The Tower of Fears in the dark
Is spreading its aura all around
The magical power is here
The Black Master's waiting for me

Oh, in their eyes
The same insane gaze that lights in mine

And the pride
To be the ones who will bring back
The dark in these lands

The Tower of Fears in the dark
Is spreading its aura all around
The magical power is here
The Black Master's waiting for me
