Feels like someone calling
"Stand up" I have to stay awake
And I can't move

Chains tight up my body
They want me to say the truth
But I can't speak

Feels like they cannot help themselves
They can't find the answer

Set me free
To the wind of the summer dance

Through the field and through the storm
As the battle roars
I can hear the Holy Voice

This cage is cold and dirty
The smell of death is all around
And I can't breath

The Voice told me the secret
Now I can defeat the Lord
But I can't move

Feels like they cannot help themselves
They can't find the answer

Set me free
To the wind of the summer dance

Through the field and through the storm
As the battle roars
I can hear the Holy Voice
