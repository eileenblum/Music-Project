The thunder and the rain are in my veins
The rage of my spirit is in my sword
God saves my soul
From the sky of this world
Give me another destiny 
The Dragon can fly in its sky
Listen to my voice and my cry
Dragon fly with me
with my destiny
Save me from this time

Take my hand and my misery
The rain of this world keep falling on me
In the time of reality
every man is misery
The Sword in the ancient rock 
is the time of victory
When the moon covers the sun
and the Dragon can fly
When the fairies come to me
I will be free

Change the world of reality
Where the moon is sad and dying
Bring me in the time of my memory
Where the dragon can fly in the sky
Please save my soul from this destiny
You are the Fairy of the Moon and the Sun
You will change this world in a Paradise 
I am the warrior lost in time
The future of my life is written in the sun
The fairies of the night light in the dark
They guide my eyes
to my destiny
Take my hand and walk with me
My life and my death are in your mind
The remembrance of my land is in my heart
Dragon fly with me
with my destiny
Save me from this time
