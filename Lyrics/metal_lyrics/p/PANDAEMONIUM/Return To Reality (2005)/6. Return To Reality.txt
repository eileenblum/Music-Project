Tears in the eyes of the world
shadow covers the sun
No warrior no dragon no trolls
only the rage of the wind 

When the moon will fade away
you can see the light
The magic power of this world
Return to reality for everyone

Death in the heart of the crow
water decides not to fall
to stop its flow in the long rivers
and kill everything you call life

Now man has to recall 
the force of the four elements
and you have to fear 
the rage of the world

This dying world is ready to hear your cry
died for our blame and all the dirty crimes
In this tragic time you whisper your last goodbye

Tears in the eyes of the moon
sheï¿½s watching the end of the world
no battle no blade no wars
only the rage of the earth

Fire invades the world
man tries to challenge his god
Remember the time of the moon and the sun
when people was able to love
