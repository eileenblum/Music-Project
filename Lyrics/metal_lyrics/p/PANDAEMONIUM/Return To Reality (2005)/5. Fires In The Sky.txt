Before the war has started
I used to smile up to the world
Now that the blades are fighting
I sadly watch my dirty hands
When there were peace and joy days
everything seemed to ever last
When I took up my black sword
I've carried away that illusion
I've seen a child wandering trough desert plans
on the run from the pain he had to feel
I've seen a woman looking at her hands
where she kept the last tear that her lost man shed
When he went to war

[Bridge]
Tell me if there is a chance to live
or are we waiting for the silence' speech
Silence will speak withÃ

Fires in the sky
Trough the rainy clouds
Life is slipping through my fingers
The power of Fire burning tonight
I've heard the whispers of two lovers in the wind
died together in an endless embrace
I've seen an old man with his eyes wide shut
He was feeling all the dark without a sight
'cause the time has come

Before the war has started
I used to smile up to the world
Now that the blades are fighting
I sadly watch my dirty hands
When there were peace and joy days
everything seemed to ever last
When I took up my black sword
I've carried away that illusion
