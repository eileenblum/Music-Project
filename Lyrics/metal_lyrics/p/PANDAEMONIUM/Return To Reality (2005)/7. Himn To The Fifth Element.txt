Come! Oh master of the time
to save this world of corruption
Pull back your hands
I see your Rainbow
Help us to walk trough it
I know at the end of the road
the greatest treasure I will find
Peace for everyone
I can see the Rainbow 
but I canÃ­t walk trough it
When you will allow me
I will be free

Come with me master of the time
Walk with me for eternity
Bring me back in my time
The truth is in my heart
Born to remember the sun
of a far and forgotten land
Welcome to the rainbow of the time
where the dragon can fly
You can give me back my time
and dragons of the sky
Warriors with heavy swords
and fire for a torchCome! Oh master of the time
to save this world of corruption
Pull back your hands
I see your Rainbow
Make your hand go down on us
Bring us to your endless life
Your Force, Wisdom and Majesty
is the same of the four elements
You are nothing, you are everything
you are death, you are life
you are anything you want to be 
Be my Salvation!
