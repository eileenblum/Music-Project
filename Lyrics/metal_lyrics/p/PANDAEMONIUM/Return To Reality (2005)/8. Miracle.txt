I see hate in your eyes
and I hear screams of pain all around
Many ones are leaving this world
as the battle is still raging on
No one knows when this war will stop
but itÃ­s late to give up the fight
DonÃ­t speak, I know that youÃ­ve change
Hear my words, try to understand
Trust in me thereÃ­s a chance to be free

Oh, here I am, I am near by your side
Can you believe in a Miracle for you and I?
IÃ­m the one who everything sees
and I know that youÃ­re more than you think
Leave your past life there where you are
The end of the road is still far
Can you see the stars in the sky?
Tell about your future life
Here, in my crystal ball
see your fate donÃ­t wait no more
YouÃ­re the Savior of this world

Time is right to stop the silence 
you are the one weÃ­ve waited for
ThereÃ­s no answer to your question 
Time for us to win the night
Fight, Warrior
IÃ­ am the one who everything sees 
and I foresaw the end of this war
Victory is there in your hands
but the end of the road is still far
Forever, IÃ­ll be by your side

Never lose hope, never give up
Never tame them, you can win
Never stop to find a reason
to wake up and fight another day
