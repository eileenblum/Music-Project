Black thunder breaks the sky
howling winds and haze cover the sun
in the mist fear growing in our mind
hate will feed the damned blackened Star
It shines on our lands
leading soul to evil side
But I see the end of all dreams
theyÃ­re falling away and itÃ­s made to be seen
Blind are the Angels
they donÃ­t see our fate
the feeling of pain
is now turning to hate

Feel all the evil power 
burning first the dirty cowards
WeÃ­ll be the last in line
fight against the dark 
(IÃ­ll stay awake)

What we have today
IÃ­ll pray the Light to shine on my way
We have to see
to feel to bring back peace on our reign
We have to keep together life and force
TheyÃ­ll never have our hearts
We have to keep the faith alive
in the eyes of our babes
Like puppets in a weird game
theyÃ­re dancing for their lord
not knowing what they fight for
slaves of a mad sorcerer
The World is not a bad place to live
The World is not a bad place to fight
for our sons to keep them alive

But I see the end of all dreams
theyÃ­ll be falling in the dark
If I see the end drawing near 
IÃ­ll be gazing on 
IÃ­ll be telling on
a story that has a fairy end
