When the night will fall
the fear of the dark 
will take up your heart
The hand of the witch 
will come to stroke your soul
When the night will fall
we weÃ­ll be there
awaiting the evil
We will return from the ancient land 
with the honour

Time of Glory
We will be back for eternity
Time of Glory 
We will be back to win

Now the time has come
to ask my steel to fight again
Now the time has come
for the Glory of my soul
My sword is sharp and biting
is scorching in the dark of the night
she tells of battle I won 
for the Glory of my spirit

After the time of silence
After the time of legend and tales
