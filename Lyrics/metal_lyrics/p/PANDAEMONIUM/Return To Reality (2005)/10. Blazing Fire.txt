Since the time when I was born
I was on my own
No one ever told me 
what I had to do
Rage and Anger in my veins
flow but I am free
The Lonely Warrior
without any destiny
Many people come and go
they donÃ­t know what theyÃ­re for
I feel IÃ­m shining like a star
My blade spreads my light

Without any fear and pain
I ride against the wind
with a Blazing Fire
burning my heart again
Blood and Iron is my law
I will never fall
Try to stop me and you will 
taste my heavy steel 
As another innocent dies
I raise my eyes and cry
I feel I have to fight for them
ItÃ­ s my fate and I wonÃ­t bend

Now that I am grown and old 
and IÃ­ll soon be gone 
I remember times when I was
strong and free
Painful disease cuts my skin 
I am sinking deep
the lonely warrior is coming 
to his last breathe

Many people come and go
and now IÃ­m going too
I feel IÃ­m shining like a star 
My blade spreads my light
