Can't hesitate in the Silence
we are the warriors of the dark
sons of an ancient mystery
We'll save your soul from your destiny
The truth is behind a veil of mist
A cutting blow divides in two
your thoughts your reason your will
to live
You will live for the Ancient Land
where we are now
You will live searching better way
and we will wait for you

Keep on following the light of your heart
We're in this light, take up my hand

You will live for the Ancient Time
We are here in the other side
Look your soul in the mirror of life
The truth is in your heart
in the vastness of the sky
in the rain that falls
in the force of the sun

Your mind and body smile now
they can hear the song of life
played by the traveling Minstrel
to take you in the near future
Now you are next to the light
don't be afraid of your destiny
take up my hand and come with me
in the Light

Take up my hand
