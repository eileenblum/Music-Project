[Music and lyrics: Lorenzo Zirilli]

[Solo: Alex Niall]

Screams of pain
'till morning comes to face the night,
but dark's still calling.
From right to wrong
My soul has been wondering all this time.
The sea of blood,
the war, the blades are far from here.
All desperate tears we cried in vain
for reasons that now are far and gone.

The blood, the thunder,
the scream of the innocent,
the sorrow, the torment
are roaming my mind.
Dust on my sword,
emptiness fillin' me.
There are no more reasons
to cry or to laugh.

Screams of pain
'till morning comes far away from now.
Screams of pain,
who's to blame for my useless life?

God saved my soul, where's the reason why?
My heart is bleeding, I'll wait till twilight.
War is now calling, I can stand no more.
Maybe my way is not here anymore

Right before my eyes
He's standing marching on the ground
Right before my eyes
He's calling me
Right before my eyes
The master of Space, Time and War
Right before my eyes
Now it's my time

[Solo: Ragman]
[Solo: Giulio Capone]

Now the time has come
for me to fight again,
Please now let me
take my sword to fight again

Now the time has come
for me to fight again,
Please now let me
take my sword to fight again

[Solo: Alex Niall]

Screams of pain
'till morning comes to face the night,
but dark's still calling.
From right to wrong
My soul has been wondering all this time.
The sea of blood,
the war, the blades are far from here.
All desperate tears we cried in vain
for reasons that now are far and gone.

God saved my soul, where's the reason why?
My heart is bleeding, I'll wait till twilight.
War is now calling, I can stand no more.
Maybe my way is not here anymore

Don't wanna live no more
My life has lost all its meaning
Don't wanna waste again tears and blood
Right before my eyes
He's standing, taking up my hands
He takes my soul with him
and carries it away
