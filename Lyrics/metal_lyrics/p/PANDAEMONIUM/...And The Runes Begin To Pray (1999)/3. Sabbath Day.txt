[Music and lyrics: Daniel Reda]

Screaming and laughing dancing in your head
The angels arrive scorched by death
Today with the idea of destroying the world,
you can't escape, cause they are the witches of... (Death)

On Sabbath day you have to pray
From ashes come the murderers,
the Kings of the Death
(Hail to the Kings of the Death)
Sabbath day, you fear this day
cause they are the witches of... (Death)

[Solo: Alex Niall]
[Solo: Ragman]

Thunder and lightning obscured the sun
The fog is rising from Hell into your mind
Their satanic dancing has attacked your brain,
you can't escape, cause they are the witches of... (Death)

On Sabbath day you have to pray
From ashes come the murderers,
the Kings of the Death
[Hail to the Kings of the Death]
Sabbath day, you fear this day
cause they are the witches of... (Death)

[Solo: Ragman]
