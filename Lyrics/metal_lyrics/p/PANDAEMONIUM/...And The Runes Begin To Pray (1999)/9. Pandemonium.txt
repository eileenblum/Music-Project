[Music and lyrics: Daniel Reda]

An ancient man was riding with death in his heart,
his beautiful black horse was trying to understand
why the ancient rider was crying
while looking from his hand to the gloomy sky.
His heavy black sword was shining in the air,
all was the result of his damaged brain.

Hate invaded my brain,
destruction's the only thing I want.
Desire of blood
Burns in my head cause I will shine
In a gloomy world...

Time of glory, time of decadence,
living or burning, strength or loneliness,
winner or loser, you can't make your choice,
dream up a future, it will be your life.
(it will be your life)

Fly with your soul before you die
cause your name in this world will just mean death.
I escape cause this is Pandemonium

Death's the one god to pray,
fog and fire begin to rise again
like creatures of the mind,
a corrupted mind born to reign
in a gloomy world

Time of glory, time of decadence,
living or burning, strength or loneliness,
winner or loser, you can't make your choice,
dream up a future, it will be your life.
(it will be your life)

Fly with your soul before you die
cause your name in this world will just mean death.
I escape cause this is Pandemonium
