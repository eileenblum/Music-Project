[Music and lyrics: Daniel Reda]

We are gonna blow this place away,
we're here to kill Dwarves and Elves.
Your end is drawing closer,
we got the magic power.
Gather around young warriors,
only the strong survive.

[Solo: Lorenzo Zirilli]

Time of war, time of blood,
time of war, time of witchery

Time of war, time of blood,
time of war, time of witchery

From time to time
a warrior found the strength to hurl his axe or throw the lance,
and for a while the fury of the battle grew stronger,
but it was soon lost against the wall of shields.

Trolls, Gnomes, powerful magicians:
you cannot kill the justice.
Now it's time for your fate to come true,
there ain't no escape for you.
Gather around Druids, Dwarves and Elves,
fighting for a cause.
