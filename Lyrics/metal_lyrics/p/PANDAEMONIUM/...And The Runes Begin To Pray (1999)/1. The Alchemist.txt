[Music and lyrics: Ragman]

Don't be, don't be, don't be afraid,
Sandman's coming to your bed to pray.
You live in a dream of a thousand faces
listening to the faeries singing and playing.

"Tell me, tell me, tell me your name"
Said the little girl with the blood red hair.
Follow the stars in the Northern sky,
don't be don't be afraid to die.

Don't bee afraid of the voice from the sky,
three stars are are falling so you can realize
life gave you blindness and death in the past,
but now free your eyes from the dust.

Pray the gods of the elements:
Air, Water, Earth, Fire
(Hell and Fire)
Help me, I'm in dire straits.
Death, war, desolation.
This is my creation.

Don't turn your eyes to the blaze of the Sun,
Night is the realm where your magic grows strong,
your love, your hate, your quest to fulfill;
the Nightmare is going to be real

Fire from your eyes
When the moons of magic rise,
you're the Master of Time
and my dreams become your life

Fire from your eyes
When the moons of magic rise,
you're the Master of Time
and my dreams become your life

Face the Dark, don't fear me
I am you, believe me
Now the Dragon is forging the Blade
And the Runes begin to pray

[Solo: Ragman]
[Solo: Alex Niall]

Fire from your eyes
When the moons of magic rise,
you're the Master of Time
and my dreams become your life

Fire from your eyes
When the moons of magic rise,
you're the Master of Time
and my dreams become your life
