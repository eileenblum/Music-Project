[Music and lyrics: Daniel Reda]

"Listen to the wind", said the old man to the warrior
"Listen, it's talking to you, singing its sweet melodies,
Carrying lots of tales, tales of war, tales of peace."
"Listen, 'cause it'll speak to you
Everytime and everywhere"
Close your eyes I can feel it
Follow its path I can see it

Listen to the wind,
it's carrying melodies played by young ministrels
Listen to these songs and cry.

Listen to the wind,
it's carrying melodies played by young ministrels
Listen to these songs and cry.

"Get on my wings", said the wind to the warrior.
Unchain the weak spirit hidden beneath your armor
And I'll take you to a place
Where you will not have to fight.
Let the lady, my trusted, come and take it.

[Solo: Alex Niall]

Listen to the wind,
it's carrying melodies played by young ministrels
Listen to these songs and cry.

Listen to the wind,
it's carrying melodies played by young ministrels
Listen to these songs and cry.

Free your mind, give me your spirit,
the lady is coming for you,
let yourself be rocked by the wind
