[Music and lyrics: Daniel Reda]

Madness in my eyes,
I would have never died
The dragon flies over me
And I can't kill him

His shadow covers my soul
And I can't get out of here,
maybe I don't have the strength
or maybe I don't want to

I ride the dragon,
but I don't fight him,
I can't defeat him
Because I'm already dead

Killed by you or by myself,
trapped in my soul,
lost in my spirit,
I will never die

Fire burns my soul
Water purifies my body,
Wind blows my dust away,
Earth will keep me forever

You'll never find my body,
you'll never see my smile again,
you'll just have those few damned words
that will stay with you forever

Earth, water, wind, fire...
The dark before...
