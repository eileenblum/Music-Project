I am the incandescent revelation in a darkened world, seen by no one.
It's my unspoken words of wisdom that will guide you when you're led astray.
I am the virus of a lost mind, the ease for every rotting soul.
I'm not of this world.
I am from nowhere as I'm nothing at all.
Believe in me, and I'll light your way as you walk to your graves.
Confide in me, and tell me your sins and you will be blessed in the name of I.
Murder.
Kill, kill, kill in the name of I.
Without ears I cannot hear you pray, without eyes I cannot see your face.
Without sense I cannot feel your pain, without anything I cannot exist.
Without me you cannot judge, no reason to kill, no corpses to fill the holes.
You fake me through every era.
I'm just a hoax.
Believe in me, and I'll light your way as you walk to your graves.
Confide in me, and tell me your sins and you will be blessed.
