I fall into darkness.
I sink into oblivion.
We fall into decay.
I'm dead inside.
You left my heart to bleed.
Draining the life out of me.
Leaving every sin undone.
Leaving nothing but pain.
I fall with no intentions of saving my life from hell.
I'm not in fear of death.
I would die any day for you.
Now revenge is on my mind.
I won't be the only one who's lost.
You said we were fine.
Now we die.
We fall into darkness, we fall into decay.
Remember my eyes that I wore when you betrayed me.
It's the same eyes that will watch you burn.
Watch you burn.
I left everything undone.
I left nothing but pain.
My broken heart is bleeding in her hands.
I'm dead inside.
You said we were fine.
Now misery drowns my blackened soul.
Nothing can save me now.
And now misery drowns my blackened soul.
You said we were fine, and now we're dead.
Dead.
