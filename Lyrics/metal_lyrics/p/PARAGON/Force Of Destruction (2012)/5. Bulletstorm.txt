Restart the game
New chances for all
The collapse of civilization
A race to survive
Out of control
Burning the flags of the nations
The blood of us all is flooding the streets
When all empires are drowning
The creatures have risen
Craving for meat
Ancient terror to bring

Raining lead
A blackened sun
The end of all days
Tumbling walls
Hold your gun
Fire and pray

Tears of the gods
They sigh no more
The will to survive is the only law
Now paint it black
Paint with blood and gore
On seas of blood search the save shore
Dying in the bulletstorm

All hell let loose and madness reigns
Nothing to live or to die for
No heroes are left
All blown away
Gun barrel justice for all
