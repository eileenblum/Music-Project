Deep below fields of doom
Weird places no one knows
Beyond all the halls of gloom
New life's about to grow

The fire from the sky
And a flash in the night
In all dark and black
There's a glimmer of light

Secrecies of past lives
Secrecies untold
Unforgiven, still alive
The truth shall unfold
Hail the flame that never dies
Keep it burning bright
The secret of all prophecies:
Life may demise just to return in victory

Stars collide and worlds will die
The expanding universe
Time may forced by word or sigh
An ancient bless or curse

Secrecies of past lives - secrecies untold
Unforgiven, still alive
The truth shall unfold
Hail the flame that never dies
Keep it burning bright
The secret of all prophecies:
Life may demise just to return in victory

Secrecies of past lives
Secrecies untold
Unforgiven, still alive
The truth shall unfold
Hail the flame that never dies
Keep it burning bright
The secret of all prophecies:
Life may demise just to return in victory
