Deep down in the ground
Below the rocks
A secret entity
Awaiting e

Stones are trembling
Knowing I am there
Sensing human life
After all these years

All the captured souls
Gather around
Spirit's eternal pole
Spellbound

A drop of my blood
A touch of my hand
Traps are unlocked now
Answer my demand

Is this the devil's work
or a gift from the gods
Find the end of all despair
In the Demon's Lair
Use or destroy
All in my hands
A weight no one can ever bear
Down in the Demon's lair

Shivers down my spine
Humming machines
So pure and divine
Or dirty and mean

The arms of a corpse
Reaching for me
The smile on dried lips
Frozen in eternity

Is this the devil's work
Or a gift from the gods
Find the end of all despair
In the Demon's Lair
Use or destroy
All in my hands
A weight no one can ever bear
Down in the Demon's Lair

Is this the devil's work
Or a gift from the gods
Find the end of all despair
In the Demon's Lair
Use or destroy
All in my hands
A weight no one can ever bear
Down in the Demon's Lair
