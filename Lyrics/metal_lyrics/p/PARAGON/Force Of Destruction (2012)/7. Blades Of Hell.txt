Relics of the doomsday
We'll turn them into steel
Treasures of the wasteland
The corpses don't appeal

Determination the will to survive
Gods of the ancient came back to live

Blades of hell - a shine in the darkness
Reflecting the fire of hate from our eyes
Blades of hell - the day of the warrior
Born from the ashes we will arise
Blades of Hell

The spirit never dies
The truth in ancient tales
A lightning in the night
A force that will prevail

Contamination - we're all doomed to die
Into a new world our spirits will fly

Forged by Armageddon
In the amber of demise
Superior to all
a new breed will arise
