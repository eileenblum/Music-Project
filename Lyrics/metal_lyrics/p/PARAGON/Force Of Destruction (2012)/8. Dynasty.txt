Return of the warlords
An age of thundersteel
Pretenders of an old law
Forced to obey and kneel

The shadow reign has past
But pain is here to stay
All memories are blown away

Out signs are shining in the night
Fall to your knees
And pray to the light

A new world now awaiting me
Plagues creating a new dynasty
The tyrants end is what you see
Follow me into a brave new... dynasty

When time is just a circle
Repeating history
The dawn of a new kingdom
On the grave of liberty

A look into the future
It's the returning past
The glimpse of live will ever last
Forevermore

At night we'll be comin' upon you
A swarm of heroes
We're out for your blood
