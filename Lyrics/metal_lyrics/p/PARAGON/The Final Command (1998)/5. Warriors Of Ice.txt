Riding horses - Driven rage
The axe in hand - A poisoned land
Ending lives and all burnt down
Rape and plunder - The end unknown
[Bridge]
Cold metal steel
Cold hearted men
No more time
To confess your sins
[Chorus]
The invasion from the sea
Battle ship set warriors free
On blood trails
On trails of wrath
The red banner is to rise
Facing warriors of ice
Warriors of ice
Screams and laughin' - Indignity
Fire and ice - All you see
Cold shock took you by surprise
You start to freeze by the look in their eyes
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Riding horses - Driven rage
The axe in hand - A poisoned land
Cold shock took you by surprise
You start to freeze by the look in their eyes
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
The red banner is to rise...
