Face your last sunrise - Shiver from the cold
The glimmer of life - Behind your dyin' eyes
And all cries and moans - Still in the cellars dirt
The voices callin' - You from below
[Bridge]
The pain is gone
Hate and anger took I'ts place right now
The final step
The fear to reach the river's other side
The sense of time - Right at your neck
Bloody metallian tools - Broke your self respect
Early morning light -The masses gathering -
The voices callin' - You from below
[Bridge2]
The pain is gone
Hate and anger took I'ts place right now
The morning dew
All that remains are your...
[Chorus]
Ashes - Climb into the fire's lair
Ashes -Face your final fear
Burnt to ashes
Cries that noone hears
And ashes all that's left
The dust of time
Vanishing life - End the pain
Divious minds - Going insane
Fire and flames - Out of control
Free at last - A crying soul
[Bridge2]
[Chorus]
