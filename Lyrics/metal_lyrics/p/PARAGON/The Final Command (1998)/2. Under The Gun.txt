Times of violence
Times of decay
Armed assault
A spreading desease
Brother against brother
Blood against blood
Don't look any further
Fear reigns the neighbourhood
Don't you start talking
Nothing here to say
Better hide your face
When your life gets blown away
[Bridge]
Spiral of violence is rising high
One step too far and thou shalt die
[Chorus]
Under the gun - Under the gun
Ignored the warning signs
Under the gun - Under the gun
Staking out the claims
In the market place
Never ending struggle
Caught in a rat race
The price of life is cheap
See it going down
Competition is on
See it day by day
Fortified territories
Armed to the teeth
The law of the gun
Is the only belief
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
