Get of my back - Don't bother me
Don't really want you around don't you see
The wrong you have done can't be reversed
You're poison to my soul
The season of trust you have betrayed
Damage cannot be undone it's too late
Won't change my mind - No place to hide
You cannot avoid your fate
[Bridge]
I will track you down
Vindication shall be done
[Chorus]
Eye for an eye
Life for a life
Vengeance shall be mine
Eye for an eye
Tooth for tooth
A life for a life
The nightmare won't end - you'll pay for your lies
Don't turn your back or get ready to die
No mercy for you - I will not let loose
You won't escape my wrath
Time's on my side - In darkness I wait
The light of the moon a flash of the blade
Can't change my mind - No place to hide
No way to avoid your fate
