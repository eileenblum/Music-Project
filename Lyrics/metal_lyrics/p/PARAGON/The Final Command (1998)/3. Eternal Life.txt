Trapped in darkness - Alive and dead
Thousand years - A blink of the eye
I'm searching by the light of the moon
Unknown stories - I can tell
The lurking horror - Out of hell
Damned to live by the light of the moon
[Bridge]
Riding through the dawn
Hiding from the sun
Addicted to the blood - Desperate for love...
The ancient curse - Flows in my veins
Demon blood - Forever reigns
Cloaked in darkness - beware the night
Countless victims - Through the years
Perpetual nightmare - Breeding fear
The dark stranger - beware the night
[Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
Hellbound - Legend still lives on
Revenge - Live in fear of
[Chorus]
Eternal life - A curse from the past
Damned to live for all time
No one to fear - The spell ever lasts
Damned to search for all time
A long lost love - Of times gone by
A vision - That will never die
She haunts my dreams forevermore
Finally found - For what I seek
Follow me - Into the black
I'll make you mine forevermore
[Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
