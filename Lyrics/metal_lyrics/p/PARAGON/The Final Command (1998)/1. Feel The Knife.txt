They keep me locked in
To repent my sins
Yes, I'm the bastard
And I allways win
Bad blood of the ages
Poison in history's traces
Got a beast in me
Addicted to the steel
[Bridge]
Don't turn your back
Don't close your eyes
I destroy your dreams
Thou shalt demise
[Chorus]
Feel the knife - Metallic strike
Taste the fear - Loose your life
Feel the knife - Sacrifice
Mortal terror - Sacrifice
They try to change me
But they can't succeed
Yes, I'm the killer
On your nightmares I feed
On through the ages
The horror never dies
No way to stop me
I will always return
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Crawling through the night
Your eyes stare full of fright
On the road to hell
Now it's time to meet your end
As you see the axe descend
Killer's revenge - Life after death
[Chorus]
