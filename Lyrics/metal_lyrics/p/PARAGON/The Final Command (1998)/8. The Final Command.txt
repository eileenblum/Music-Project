The prophecy
Of ancient times
Fortells a future bleak
Clairvoyant master
The alchemist
Visions of mankinds defeat
[Bridge]
The warnings
The signs
See the black horseman ride
The demons
Will rise
On wings of death they glide
[Chorus]
Far beyond reality
Far beyond our dreams
The final hour is at hand
I hear the last command
Polluted seas
No hope for life
The skies are turning red
All that was written
All that was said
Is now becoming so real
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Searching for a sanctuary
Down in the land of doom
Damn all the visionaries
Nightmares are comin' true
[Chorus]
