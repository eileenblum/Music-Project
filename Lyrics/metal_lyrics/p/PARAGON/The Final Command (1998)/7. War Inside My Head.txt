Here I sit - an empty room
Listening to this certain song
Thinking about things that went wrong
Deaden my senses - numb is my heart
It's hard to see that we're apart
Don' t let me hang on in the dark
[Bridge]
Minutes turning into days
Hours turning into years
There's nothing I can do
[Chorus]
I lead a war inside my head
And now my blood turns to lead
But even though I try
It brings back... the tears into my eyes
I miss your face - I miss your laugh
Your absence is like you died
Hear my cries - Don't give a damn
I really hate to pay this price
And all I feel is pain inside
The memory of your love remains
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Take a little time and think it over
Think about our love we used to share
We still got feelings for each other
The loss of you is more than I can bear
[Chorus]
