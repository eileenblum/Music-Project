Your final destination
Tonight's the city's womb
The church of profit and greed
No songs to praise the kings
But tortured being's screams
No bread and wine but roasted human meat

Deep and down
In the underground
The evil black
Swallows every sound
Figures moving in a torture twist
Thoughts are knocked out by the devil's fist

Meat train - feed our town
Be a part and make it grow
Meat train - on bloodstenched ground
Obey the dark lords of down below

The roots are groping for ya
Slashing wild around
Cutting and ripping the meat
Your destiny's fulfilled
Final breath and scream
Melting flesh in the oven's heat

Be the beat
Of the city's heart - eternity
And now you're a part
Of a growing town that will never sleep
You sow the wind - this is what you'll reap

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
