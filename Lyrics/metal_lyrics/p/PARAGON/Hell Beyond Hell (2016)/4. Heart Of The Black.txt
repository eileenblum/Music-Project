Deep below majestic rocks
In a realm bare of life
Removed from the world
In everlasting night
A blade forged by the gods
Sacred and divine
Made to rule the world
On the outset of the time

To end the pain - fight the oppression
Were questing the blade - this is our mission
Brave at heart - no turning back
Bound by the oath
Onwards to the heart - heart of the black

Under the mountains
Sheltered in secrecy
The blade is rising up
Fulfilling the prophecy
Out in the fields - the killing is on
Fire and smoke - eclipsing the sun
The blade is calling us
No turning back
In the heart of the black

Foul winds from the depths of hell
As we cross the gate
We broke the seal to nameless horrors
Guardians of the blade

And in the hope of despair
We keep on descending down to the lair
Fear in our hearts - no turning back
Bound by the oath
Onwards to the heart - heart of the black

[Chorus]

Stairway to the underground
No mortals walked before
Ancient horrors all around
Inside the mountains core
Crawling through this labyrinth
We must fulfil our fate
A whisper in our very mind
As we're approaching the blade

[Chorus]

We will return - we will return!
From eternal night - eternal night!
Victory is drawing near
In glory we'll ride
Under the mountains
A light in the dark
Time has come, we're striking back
We have returned
From the heart of the black
