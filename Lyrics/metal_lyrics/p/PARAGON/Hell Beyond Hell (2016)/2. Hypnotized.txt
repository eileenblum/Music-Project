Eyes of a snake - danger ahead
You conquer my mind with your might
The sins not outlived
The evil undone
I'm on the edge between wrong or right

Controlling me
And freedom is gone
My new master
Now we act as one

Hypnotized - my will in chains
Paralysed - the eyes of a snake
Your tool, deaf numb and blind
Work for my master's sake
When my life is at stake

Under control - under attack
You feed on my strength and my soul
Commit perfect crimes
The pain is all mine
Left here alone, rot and die in this hole

I played my role
Without a script
You took my soul
Torn and ripped

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2x]
