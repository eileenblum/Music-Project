Rolling thunder in distant skies
Shadows of the past
A final glance on familiar faces
Time is running fast

Lost and buried in the sand of time
On history's garbage heap
A million fates - half of a line
Praise the king - save the queen

Embark - to the gates of hell
We're caught in a twilight zone
Straight into nothingness
Or the great unknown

The wind in Charon's cloak
Sand in the hourglass
Tickets with no return
Through time - future and past

When souls are flying away
Facing the sun - facing it all alone
When souls are flying away
Cursed and damned
And the lost ones die alone

Memories from another time
We're begging, we're praying for another day
No more boys and not yet men
Rotting lives and slow decay

We're holding on to our cold brides
Starring into the dark
Clenching our fists so hard
For the last time - a call to arms

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2x]

Who told us about the angels
The lie that they're always kind
See their joy when they gamble
Feeding on screams and pain
