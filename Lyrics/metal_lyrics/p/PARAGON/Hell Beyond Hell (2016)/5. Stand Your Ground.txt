Last rays of the setting sun
Tombstone's shadows grow
Another prey is on the run
Time to start the show

Hear the signals echoes
Hanging in the streets
When the knifes are glowing
In the nightfall's heat

Stand your ground
Hold at any cost
Stand in line for unity
The loner is the lost
Stand your ground
Fighting side by side
Bound to the colours
We are sworn to the fight

Gathering in the starting rain
With eyes so full of hate
Ready for an act of pain
Yet the victim is a bait

Lurking in the doorways
Ambush in the night
Invaders in our alleys
For our reign we'll fight

[Chorus 2x]

Bound to the colours
We are sworn to the fight
Stand your ground
Stand your ground
Bound to the colours
We are sworn to the fight
