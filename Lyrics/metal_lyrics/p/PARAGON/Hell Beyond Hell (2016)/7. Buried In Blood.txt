On the road to nothingness
Fading dreams and hopes
Surveillance games in secrecy
All lives in a scope

Bad seeds down the drain
On a rush for gold
Critics are in vain
We're sorted and we're sold

Designed by mortal hands
In fatal arrogance
Made in a jar
All hail the chosen few
A rusty hook in the bait
Too late for me and you

Hellbound - hellbound!
Drowning lives
All swept away by the flood
Spellbound - spellbound!
Fading dreams
When all is gone
We're buried
Buried in blood
Buried in blood!

The army of the rubbernecks
Black souls dressed in white
Doing just what can be done
Genetic dynamite

Rape the Bill of Rights
Steal our dignity
Human parasites
Under the masks of sanity

A brave new world will arise
Build on debauchery and lies
Made in a jar
Hail the chosen few
Superman or Frankenstein
The choice is up to you

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Buried in blood!
Buried in blood!
