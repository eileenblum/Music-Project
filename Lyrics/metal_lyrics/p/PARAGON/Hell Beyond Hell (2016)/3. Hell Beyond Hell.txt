Sign your name
Sign in blood
Punch in your code
Secret words
Secret signs
Ticket for this road

It's your new religion
On your trail of pain
A man servants final bow
On a down-bound train

Ain't a secret what may be
And you are a part of me

Hell beyond hell
On the edge of darkness
A deadly trap is now revealed
Hell beyond hell
In the holy fire
Nailed to a burning cross in hell
Beyond hell

[Lead: Christian]

Sell your soul
Sell your life
Show me all you've got
Waste your time
Waste your life
The wire's getting hot

It's burning fever
A bad disease
Death to the unbelievers
Suffer and decease

Got your hopes
Got your dreams
All your wishes
And your sins

Hell beyond hell
On the edge of darkness
A deadly trap is now revealed
Hell beyond hell
In the holy fire
Nailed to a burning cross in hell
Beyond hell

[Lead: Bertram / Christian / Bertram]
[Double lead: Bertram &amp; Christian]

Hey!

Hell beyond hell
On the edge of darkness
A deadly trap is now revealed
Hell beyond hell
In the holy fire
Nailed to a burning cross in hell

Hell beyond hell
A deadly trap is now revealed
Hell beyond hell
Nailed to a burning cross in hell
Beyond hell
