(We're) coming out at night
Disciples of true steel
The virgin flesh we seek
And bring them all to heel

The Sleeper's wake-up call
The enemy within
Standing all for one
The mass shall now begin

Up from the ground
From the ashes we'll rise
Forever we're bound
With fire in our eyes

And from dark to light we will claim our realm
We will bring the law - this is our time
The rising force is here to rule and to reign
This is the sacred, sacred moment in time

Fate and destiny
Implanted in our heads
Ancient legacy
The truth has to be spread

End our masquerade
New life beyond the veil
Reborn for this raid
We're the science holy grail

You can't resist
Fall in despair
Your name's on our list
And the horde's everywhere

[Chorus 2x]
