Trapped down here in purgatory
Hypnotized by a force beyond believe
Blurring features - Scaring flesh
I'm all alone as the nightmare begins...

See my life now passing by, images so real
The sins I have committed, forever haunting me,
All along the road of torture, leave this world behind
Fear of the beyond is taking hold of my mind

The Afterlife
This is the Afterlife

A thousand voices call my name
They echo through the hall
Grasping hands â creaking floorboards
Into the void I'm gonna fall

No light at the end of the tunnel
No hope at the end of the road
Falling into fire
Burning in this hell
Take me back to reality
Someone break the spell
