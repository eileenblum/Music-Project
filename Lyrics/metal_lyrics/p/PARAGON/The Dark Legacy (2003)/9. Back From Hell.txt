Reborn
Feel the wind in my hair
Return
Free from despair
Free my mind â Breathe again
Feel the rain on my face
Taste the blood â Beat the pain
This is the end of the chase

I have seen the underworld
More than I could bare
Branded by the purgatory
In the devil's lair

Back from hell
In the end I'm free again
Back from hell
And the visions will remain
Back from hell

The past and the present
Merging in my memories
Forever
I'm cursed by the legacy
Here I am to carry on
Though I will never go back
To the trails of terror â the halls of horror
Hidden below in the black
