Hear the crowd
Demanding a hero
A gate swings open
Screams are filling the air
The smoke is waving
Wide open eyes
Behind the gateway of terror
Watch and stare

Lord of thunder
King of pain
Humbly whispered names
A pair of wild eyes
Shine in the dark
Seeking for glory and fame

In the hall of horror
Legends are born
Now it's time to make the score
In the deadly eye
The eye of the storm

Born of wrath
An angel of war
The titans are clashing
Brave at heart
Smashing and pounding
Shaking the ground
Who will stand
Who will be torn apart
