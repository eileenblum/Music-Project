Fear the dark and fear the nightfall
The future and the past
What will await me behind the silvered glass
The sky is black â the wind is hauling
The force will revive
Nightmares are filled with life

Lashing winds â raging storm
Thunder in the air
A pale moon in the blackest night
Fills me with despair

Breakin', breakin' glass
Spellbound by the call
From far beyond the mirror on the wall
Breakin', breakin' glass
Evil is unleashed
I am drawn into the kingdom of the beast

Drifting on a sea of horrors
Stars explode in the mist
Distant places where no time exists
I see myself in broken glass
Starring back at me
I'm gonna take a look into eternity
