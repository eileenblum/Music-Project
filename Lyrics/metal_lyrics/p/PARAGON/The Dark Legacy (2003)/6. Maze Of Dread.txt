A thousand doors all around me
The hallway never ends
A million ways to change my fate
Trapped in a wonderland

Rays of light leading nowhere
Mirrors on the walls
An unknown fate's awaiting me
Tumbling worlds will fall

I hear nails scratching on stones
Fear the sound of breaking bones

Life and death will unite
In this deadly trap
Pain and fear in the night
Caught in a maze of dread

No time to choose â no time to wait
A force I can't escape
Destiny is marking my way
Visions are taking shape

Walls of fire at my back
The past is gonna burn
A fire-breath is on my track
Hell awaits my turn

Run from the fire
Feel sweat and tears
Demonic fire
Caught in a maze of fear
