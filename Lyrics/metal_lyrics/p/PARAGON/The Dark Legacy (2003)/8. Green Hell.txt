Step into another hell
In the mud is where you dwell
On through a swamp of rotten trees
With snapping beasts below your feet

A boiling brew â the poisoned air
Pleading answers â earning despair

Forgotten realms - Forgotten times
Locked in this horror by an evil spell
Trails of terror painted in blood
Your lost in a green hell
Green Hell

Slip into a pool of pain
Sweat and tears are mixed with rain
A pair of eyes blocking your way
Face to face â who will prevail

The mirror's waiting - another gate is near
Be on your way â show no fear
