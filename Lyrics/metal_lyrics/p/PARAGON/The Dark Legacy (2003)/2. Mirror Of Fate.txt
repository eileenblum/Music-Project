Break the black door â a secret room
Four candles burning bright
I face myself â a silver tomb
No escape from the magic light

Bound now by my own stare
And my soul will be the fare

Re-animate
The mirror of fate
Revelations of secret worlds
The demons of time
Breaking the line
A gateway from beyond
The mirror of fate

A sudden wind - the flames increase
Waiting for the magic words
Catching my breath when the storm has ceased
In this place of the absurd

Run away â never look back
A demon's call â out of the black

In a lair of sorcery
An open book enchanting me

Past and present merging
My fantasies are urging... me
