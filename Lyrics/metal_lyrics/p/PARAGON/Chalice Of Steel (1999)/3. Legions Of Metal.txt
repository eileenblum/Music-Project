Visions of the moment in my bloodred eyes
No time to repent - the scars on my face
It's waiting for you
It's waiting for me
Beyond the black
Lies the thing that should not be
...Should not be
Up from the ashes
We shall arise
Out of the underground
Into the night
United forces
Hearts filled with pride
Legions of metal
Forever ride
Raindrops on black leather
The glittering steel
Through the smoke we spot the enemy
The guns are loaded
Swords sharpened twice
Riding down the road
Armed and ready to fight
...to fight
[Chorus]
Together we ride
Through storm an rain
United we strike
