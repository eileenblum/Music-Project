Riding on the wind on wings as hard as steel
The thunderstorm sounds leave no way to conceal
Breaking through the waves a reversed waterfall
The fire breath of hell condense to a ball
[Bridge]
No one who dares
To stand and fight
Paralyzed by the
Look in their eyes
Lords of the realms
Of the middleage
Born to be kings
To rule the land
Darkness cloaks the land steels all light of day
The sunlight reveals in these days of decay
Sinister yellow clouds - sulphur in the air
Mankind bow their heads crying in despair
Down from the hills
Into the towns
Born to kill
To destroy all around
The mighty kings
Fear them and hide
On inflamed wings
They ride through the night
[Chorus]
Fly on
Mighty winds of the west
Leave no trace of your existence
Leave the land in waste
Reign on
With the smoke in your eyes
Times will change to wrong from right
On your wicked flight
The dragons flight
