Before all time, the twilight of creation
A quest for power had begun
A cup of steel, forged in the master's furnace
With secret knowledge of the one.
The ancient conflict of dark against the light
Eternal battle the never ending fight.

[Pre-Chorus]
Self fullfilling prophecy leader of the dammed
Before the gods you'll kneel
Searching for the sacred cup, to wield its magic powers
The demons wrath you'll feel:
CHALICE OF STEEL

A secret lodge the keepers of the chalice
Masters of war and destiny
Forbidden fortress, beyond unholy wastelands
Through all time in secrecy.
The demons servants searching for the keep
The powers of the chalice, for evil use they seek.

The spell has been broken, evil unleashed
Unchained the warriors of hell
Merciless onslaught riders of doom
Attacking the old citadel.
Converging armies ultimate conflict
The cut of all time is at hand
All must arise to heed to the call
Obey the Final Command...
The ancient conflict of the dark against the light
Eternal battle the never ending fight.
