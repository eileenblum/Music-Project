Five thousand years ago
On the banks of the Nile
A sacred place
The birth of a child
The rites of the ancient
In the temples of Seth
Priest of the underworld
Casting the spells
The wrath of the gods
The curse of Osiris - forever damned
Initiation secrets of the old
Invocation evil to unfold
Wheels of eternity
Forever grind
The sign of the ancient
Through space and time
On through the centuries
He walked the earth
Lived in the cities
Of mankind
Fortells the future
Turns lead into gold
Constructs machines
That sails the skies
In the sign of the pentagram
By the powers of night - forever damned
Initiation secrets of the old
Invocation evil to unfold
