In the forest at the hill
Something wicked has been found
Rumors of a witches skill
A story goes around
"Go and get her!" they yell
As the fear turns to hate
"We'll take that bitch to hell
An end her vicious fate"
Through the dawn
By the light of the full moons eyes
Now all is gone
Like the ashes blown by the wind
Burn!
Burn at the stake
Burn!
For heaven's sake
In the early morning light
She was taken into town
The judge proclaims the sentence
"To die on holy ground"
The wine runs like blood
On this glorious bright day
The hot tar and dry wood
Her poor soul flies away
