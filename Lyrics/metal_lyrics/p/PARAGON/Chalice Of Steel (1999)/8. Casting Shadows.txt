Sitting in a dark room
By flickering candle light
When a black cat starts to moan
Hear the creatures of the night
By the bursting crystal ball
The vision turns to dust
Echoes from the stone walls
And shatters the dusk
Calling out
To the mysteries
Speaking words
Of darkness...now
Open mind - Magic light
Casting shadows
Casting shadows
Truth not true - Live no life
Ancient words
Ancient words
Heaven and hell - Read the spell
Casting shadows
Casting shadows
Rise from the ashes a blaze...in the shadows
The pages turn and turn
I hear footsteps down the hall
The pages start to burn
My secret name they call
Revelation in their voices
No place for disgrace
Words from my lips increase
The tear in time and space
