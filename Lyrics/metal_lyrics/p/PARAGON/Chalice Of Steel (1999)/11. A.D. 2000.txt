The evolution has reached the end
Unknown demons
Forgotten - Now close at hand
Pyromania on the powder hill
The betrayed souls
Again they're ready to kill
The rage for knowledge
All science at the end
The quest for power
But nothing to defend
Now we face the final dawn
The bloodred sky falls down
It's the last breath that you take
Apocalyptic dawn
The disillusion the bitterness
Increasing clouds
Thunder roars - Lightning strikes
Poisoned air and acid rain
Gods of war
Screaming their commands...
