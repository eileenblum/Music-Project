The empty room narrows
Swallows the light of the day
A cold wind whispers
Tells me I have to repay my time
Ashes in my clothes
Glittering shadows of grey
The soul burns bridges
The end of it's prosperity
Feed my head
With bitter lies and lethargy
Time to cure
My sins reveal in pouring rain
The pain - No place to hide
The fear inside that controls my mind
Journey Home - Run like the wind
Reborn again - Escape the blackened fate
The constant reminder
Scars turning red in the heat
The weight of remembrance
Can't crush the eternal weed inside
The blood on my face
The sweetest dry liqour - revenge!
Run down to the river
Trickles away in the sand
Venomous lies -Terror device
Rebellion
Killing my mind - No peace to find
Rebellion
Being tossed and turned
So far I can recall
My memories are banned
And locked behind a wall
