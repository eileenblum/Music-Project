Trail of the afterlife to the land of the dead
Where souls captured in another maze of dread
They'll all meet in here behind the final gate
Unforgiven - in hate
Lost in a world of grey between life and death
Searchin' for the exit the only chance they have
Across the river step into the hallway
Damnation - the price to pay
The pain goes on
The cries cuts in
Screams of vengeance howl
The torture never goes
By the sign of the cross
And all symbols of hate
DESECRATE
False prophets always claimed the end of the world
But the few who know they'll never say a word
Unholy crucible - merge in something new
Beware the wicked brew
?Gods of wrath return - desecrated souls of hell
Terrorised victims in fear they yell
Raping their minds brings them to despair
A final scream in the air
Out of the shadows
Marching new creatures
The will to survive
That keeps them alive
The evil lives on
The good to destroy
They're driven by hate
And all that they preach...(is to) desecrate
[Chorus]
