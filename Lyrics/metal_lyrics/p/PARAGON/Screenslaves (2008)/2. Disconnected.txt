Trapped in a can to suffocate and die
The pressure's gone eyes are open wide

I will swear allegiance
To whatever will appear
Serve every deity
Just get me out of here...

Space burial, unholy ritual
Human ashes build the stars
Disconnected, doomed to die
Solar winds forever in our hearths

Dressed in white heading for the black
The revived body's getting numb again

Caught up in nightmare
I should not wish to end
Force to face reality
Ain't no saviour to be send

Space burial, unholy ritual
Human ashes build the stars
Disconnected, doomed to die
Solar winds forever in our hearths

[Solo]

Space burial, unholy ritual
Human ashes build the stars
Disconnected, doomed to die
Solar winds forever in our hearths [x2]
