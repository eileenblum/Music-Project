An aching body
Slowly hits the ground
And footsteps echo, fading quick away
A pale curtain, paints the picture grey

Live your life in isolation
You fear the blade in the dark
Hide forever in the shadows
Your name's engraved on the blade
The blade in the dark

Figures in the game
Of friend and foe
Exchanging secrets, under marble arcs
Dastardly, dwelling in the dark

Live your life in isolation
You fear the blade in the dark
Hide forever in the shadows
Your name's engraved on the blade
The blade in the dark

[Solo]

Your desperate soul's locked up, nearly dead
Reach out for the key, loose your head
But you have to

Live your life in isolation
You fear the blade in the dark
Hide forever in the shadows
Your name's engraved on the blade
The blade in the dark [x2]

The blade in the dark [x4]
