[Backstreet Boys cover]

I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, Alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent
In flashes of light

All you people can't you see,
Can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, c'mon
Cause all of your time spent
Keeps us alive
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive

All you people can't you see,
Can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

[Solo]

All you people can't you see,
Can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

And that's makes you larger

All you people can't you see,
Can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right

And that makes you larger [x2]

And that makes you larger than life [x2]
