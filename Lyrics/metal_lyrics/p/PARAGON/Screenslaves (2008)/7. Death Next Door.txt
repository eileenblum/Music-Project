My time is up and I hear them coming
The breath of hell my destiny's calling
Neon lights like lightnings to my eyes
Two strong arms get me to my bare feet
The greasy stones they make me stumble
And I see my father shouts in joy

I believed in new world wonders
In the lord and the holy ghost
Tell me now where's the lord of hosts

The death next door
Grings and rolls the dice
The death next door
He waits and swallows all the lies

Right straight a light is shining
Encouraged moves by whispered blessings
The gang of five is coming back again
Whoever broke my wheel of fortune
Whatever killed my good intentions
I'll back and find them in the end

Wasted years the wasted talents
All to fill this world with life
At the end there's no saviour
And hope of, of the after life

The death next door
Grings and rolls the dice
The death next door
He waits and swallows all the lies

[Solo]

Wasted years the wasted talents
All to fill this world with life
At the end there's no saviour
And hope of, of the after life

The death next door
Grings and rolls the dice
The death next door
He waits and swallows all the lies [x2]
