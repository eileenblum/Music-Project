Drive the nails just deeper
Deeper in my heart
My pain turns to anger
Till I'm torn apart

Bring the acid and the sait
All to dry my blood
Constant torment in this vault
Till my head explode
Explode

Slaves to machines
Slave to the screen
Depart the life
Slave of the screen

Ultraviolation
Minds caught in a web
Infraradiation
Homes turns into labs

Bring the acid and the sait
All to dry my blood
Constant torment in this vault
Till my head explode
Explode

Slaves to machines
Slave to the screen
Depart the life
Slave of the screen

[Solo]

Slaves to machines
Slave to the screen
Depart the life
Slave of the screen [x2]
