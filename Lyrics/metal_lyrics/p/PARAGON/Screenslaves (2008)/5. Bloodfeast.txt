In the long forgotten land
Buried in the dust of time
A pair of blood-red eyes are staring
As a Knell starts to chime

Sudden winds shall raise a castle
Blackened towers against the sky
Whispered cwords sail on the wind
By the beast that cannot die

Hear him calling [x2]

Serve the demon, on the bloodfeast
Yell dark hymns into the night, the night
Fill the cauldron, yeah the bloodfeast
Raise the spirits of the night

Gathered in the hall of serpents
Wind and whirls become alive
While their victims cry out sentenced
Stabs of black knifes end their lives

Blood shall rain [x2]

Serve the demon, on the bloodfeast
Yell dark hymns into the night, the night
Fill the cauldron, yeah the bloodfeast
Raise the spirits of the night

A sudden wall of fire
Thunder fills the hall
Smoke is rising higher
Answering the call

[Solo 1]

Believers! Believers!
The saviour has heard our cries!
Deceiver! Deceiver!
Yes thou shait demise

[Solo 2]

Serve the demon, on the bloodfeast
Yell dark hymns into the night, the night
Fill the cauldron, yeah the bloodfeast
Raise the spirits of the night [x2]
