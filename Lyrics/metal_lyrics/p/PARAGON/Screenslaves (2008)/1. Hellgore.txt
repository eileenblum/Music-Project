Isolated, behind a wall of ice
Humiliated, chained and blind
One more shot to keep me paralyzed
Pure poison, to control my mind

Hell's fire ahead
Burning white heat
A lurking dread
Flames know no deceit

One more soul, for the legion
One more soul, for the death parade
Take all my blood and all that's human
One more soul, unchained forever free

Violated, my thoughts show on a screen
Calculated, priced and sold
There's no more pain, no more fear inside
Nor longing for a hand to hold

Hell's fire ahead
Burning white heat
A lurking dread
Flames know no deceit

One more soul, for the legion
One more soul, for the death parade
Take all my blood and all that's human
One more soul, unchained forever free

40 days and 40 nights
The time to leave all behind
Let the new life creep inside
Leave the state of mankind

What will wait there for me?
What will wait behind that door?
When the human life has left me
I'm prepared for you hellgore

[Solo]

One more soul, for the legion
One more soul, for the death parade
Take all my blood and all that's human
One more soul, unchained forever free [x2]
