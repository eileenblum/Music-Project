In the shadows I am waiting
Got your picture, got your name
I'm the water I'm the wind
The sudden death of your life's flame
You won't face a new tomorrow
No more sunsets or a sunrise
I'm honest I'm kind
Sure I'm Death in Disguise

Ain't no time to shed a tear
When the hand of fate is here

I choose to be killing hand
I'll end it all, I'll make my stand
And I won't fail and I won't fall
I am meant for this, the killing hand

Endlessly I cross the lands
Scanning faces in the night
Prepare my arms fix the plan
Always hiding from the light
And the road leads on forever
A dark rider on it's track
You won't find a place to hide
Right now I'm at your back

I'm a creature cursed and damned
A deadly angel heaven sent

I choose to be killing hand
I'll end it all, I'll make my stand
And I won't fail and I won't fall
I am meant for this, the killing hand

[Solo]

I choose to be killing hand
I'll end it all, I'll make my stand
And I won't fail and I won't fall
I am meant for this, the killing hand [x2]
