After all these years of battle
After all these years of peace
I've been wounded praised damned and loved
A slave at the end beyond belief

Blessed with the power, the sword in my hand
Foes gonna fall, while I made my stand
Trapped in a world of glory and fame
I gave it all my soul and my name

The voice roars like thunder fills all marble halls
The pride of forefathers staring from the walls

Entombed and locked in, at night I'm reeling from the pain
Lord of the dark realm, buried but alive
Entombed forever, voices driving me insane
A slave to my name and the power till the end

Heads are gonna roll, by a word from my lips
A wave of my hand, hear the crack of the whip
A sword above and a knife behind
Sleepless nights are killing my mind

The voice roars like thunder fills all marble halls
The pride of forefathers staring from the walls

Entombed and locked in, at night I'm reeling from the pain
Lord of the dark realm, buried but alive
Entombed forever, voices driving me insane
A slave to my name and the power till the end

[Solo]

Entombed and locked in, at night I'm reeling from the pain
Lord of the dark realm, buried but alive
Entombed forever, voices driving me insane
A slave to my name and the power till the end [x2]
