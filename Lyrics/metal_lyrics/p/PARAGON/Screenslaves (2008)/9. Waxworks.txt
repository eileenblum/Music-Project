The fragile angel's stare so divine and pure
The sinful wicked flesh I will cure
You're pool is waiting, warms and inviting
We'll keep it secret, for our lifetime
Drip by drip, eternity
No more decay
My new goddess cheers me

Through all the dust of times and the winds of fate
We shall pass the gates of hell
Through a rain of tears and the falls of hate
You're preserved by my waxworks spell

The temple's waiting now as it did so long
A plinth with your name, that's were you belong

And I will worship, now and forever
I'll keep believing, I'll praise ya!
Drip by drip, eternity
No more decay
The beauty never dies

Through all the dust of times and the winds of fate
We shall pass the gates of hell
Through a rain of tears and the falls of hate
You're preserved by my waxworks spell

[Solo]

Through all the dust of times and the winds of fate
We shall pass the gates of hell
Through a rain of tears and the falls of hate
You're preserved by my waxworks spell [x2]
