Raging through the mindfields of this hollow life
An army of immortal battles on
See there ain't no reason see to all their lies
Bounded by hatered we're strong

Hammer strikes the anvil - a rage that breaker the chain
Strikes down like a lightening in our ranks
A horde of berserkers
Always seein' red
Hear the sound of crushin' bones

Feel the rush of power
Surging all around
The sound of slicing steel
That cuts them to the ground
Force of the choosen
Protectors of the sound
We march of forever and
Bring the hammer down

Fought the fight for many years
Always kept the faith
No one would ever bar our way
Sense of pride and unity
Filling our heads
The key to an everburning flame

Hammer strikes the anvil - a rage that breaker the chain
Strikes down like a lightening in our ranks
A horde of berserkers
Always seein' red
Hear the sound of crushin' bones

Feel the rush of power
Surging all around
The sound of slicing steel
That cuts them to the ground
Force of the choosen
Protectors of the sound
We march of forever and
Bring the hammer down

The first "official" Paragon release and a big step forward compared to the EP.
Shortly after it came out Blue Merle went bankrupt. Only about 1500 CDs were
pressed and distribution was poor so itÂ´s also a collectors item.
