Filthy
Human minds
Doomsday
Is setting signs

Sun ain't no longer life
Dictator
But hits with deadly rayes
Oxygen becomes posened gas
Make us suffer

Maelstorm of decline
Annihilation of our minds

Skyscrape
Is turning black
Total pollution
Pushin' greenhouse effect

Killing and wars are public
Sports
Government ain't give a shit
Exploitations of our mother
Earth
Givin' the final hit

Maelstorm of decline
Annihilation of our minds

Our planet's got a fatal disease
Ignore the lessons taught
Humanity's trail has come to verdict
Ultimate holocaust
