Armies approach leavin' no hope for life
Leavin' no defense from the foe
Calling for mercy - forgotten by all
Unearthly voices proclaiming
Allegiance to none
But carnage to all
In the mist of the night the crucifix will fall

Blessed enough to see the
Light that keeps the gift of life?
A call of arms by high
Commands fade into the night
No hope for life

The fires of hell raging on
And on in a whirlwind of genocide
All life will rot - in the twilight
The voices of millions have
Faded away - not a word you might hear
When the banshi screams
Destination is near
Blessed...

The hunter - the hunter - your fate
The winner - the looser - too late
Now that the terror is real
Bleeding souls staining the veil

Immortality - just a passing dream

Legions are lead by blasphetic conviction
The infernal empire rises right
Before their eyes
Turning the world into purgatory
Condemnation of dignity
And sanctuary
No hope for life!
