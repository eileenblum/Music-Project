Toxic wastes pollute our seas
Despair fills our skies
Bitter lost devoid of hope
We watch our planet die

Many years of vile abuse
Profit at all, cost
Nothing here to keep us back
The battle's gone and lost

Beyond the void
Point of no return

Gathered strength we build a
Ship in space we place our faith
Searching for a better world
A new and peaceful place
Secret chambers
Underground, the site of our construction
The ship is slowly taking
Shape, above immense
Destruction

Take off day has now arrived
The odyssey now begins
Forget about our bitter past
Forget about our sins
On we drift our through the
Stars, lost in outer space
Searching for the perfect
World, to found the perfect race

Beyond the void
Point of no return
