Wading through chambers of his mind
Floating in the sea of silence
Act of balance on the edge
Explore the path of life
Searching for some new ways

Fighting demons no one sees
A war inside his head
Growing paranoia - filling him with dread
Frozen houra drifting past - lost track of all time
Reality slips away - insanity left behind

Drug fiend - walking
Through the fires of hell
Falling in an endless well

Friends turning to enemies
Conspiracy in the air
Cunfusion reigns supreme
Chaos everywhere
Fading fast - he has lost the
Grip - point of no return
Borrowed time elapses
Months turn into years

Fighting demons no one sees
A war inside his head
Growing paranoia - filling him with dread
Frozen houra drifting past - lost track of all time
Reality slips away - insanity left behind

Drug fiend - walking
Through the fires of hell
Falling in an endless well

Chained and nailed a cross he
Bears - for how long will it last?
Burned out - empty eyes - the echos of the past
Been the places no one has
Been and he can't return
Rapped inside this shattered
Mind forever he will burn
