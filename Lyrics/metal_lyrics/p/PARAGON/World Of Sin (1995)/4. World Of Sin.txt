I can't see a happy ending in this world
Time runs short walking
Hand in hand with death
More and more our life is
Shifting to the end
What can explain why we
Destroy what's in our hand

No mercy to be spared - for
The wicked for the scared
Ain't nowhere to run - your
Fate has just begun

Dreams slip away - lifetime in pain
Only tears to fall
Stabbed in the back - cought within
The world of sin!

Ignored the warning - what a waste
What will it take to learn
Form our mistakes
Is there no love - is there no
Love left in this world
Look to the past - you're on a
Neverending search

Not that we are condemned
Now we understand
Get the message clear - we'll
All end up in fear

Dreams slip away - lifetime in pain
Only tears to fall
Stabbed in the back - cought within
The world of sin!

See the time slip through our hands
Buried by it's sand
Much is spoken but nothing is said
Afraid to understand

Dreams slip away - lifetime in pain
Only tears to fall
Stabbed in the back - cought within
The world of sin!
