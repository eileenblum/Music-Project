See the spell of darkness
Spread across the world
Ancient seeds of evil
Spawned and now reborn

Onward grinding war
Machine - death lies in it's path
Scorched is all that's in it's
Way - destruction aftermath

See the fires burnin' - burnin'
In the night
The shadow world's rising
Swallowing the light

Into the black

Secret convents cast their spell
Power is their aim
Mankind's lying at their feet
Shattered and in pain

Pulling strings in highest
Places -furthering their cause
The end is drawing closer
Evil is the norm

Into the black

See the fires burnin' - burnin'
In the night
The shadow world's rising
Swallowing the light
