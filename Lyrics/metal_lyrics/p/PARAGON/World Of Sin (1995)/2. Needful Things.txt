Welcome - just get in and
Take a good, good look
Around
An assortment of immense is
Waiting for you

When you close the door
Don't look back
There will be no return
Nothin' stays the same
Your life will change
When I call your name

I am your healer - I'm dealin'
With dreams
I know your obsession on certain
Needful things

Welcome
So you got something on
Your mind
I'll please your desire if you
Want me to

And it's an eye to eye
A give and take
You never get some for free
Better listen now
To what I say
This is how it's gonna be

I am your healer - I'm dealin'
With dreams
I know your obsession on certain
Needful things

Penetrate power
Crushin' your brain
Performing the duty
Emotions retrain
