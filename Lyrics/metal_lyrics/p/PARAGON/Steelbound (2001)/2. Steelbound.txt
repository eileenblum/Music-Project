The mighty sound of metal
Fills the holy hall
Eternal gods have
heard our call
Blinding light

Taste the sweat
All to rise
Their fists and yell

A blaze of raging fire
Burning up the air
Fly up to the
Dragon's lair
Roaring sounds
Thunder in the sky
Grinding guitars
Take you up so high

Steelbound we are
Steelbound forever we'll be
There is a power - can you hear the call
Steelbound forever
Steelbound one stand for all

Energized and charged
Right down to the core
Follow and obey
Metal is the law
Forged by the flame
Hard as a rock
Pure as steel
A verdict of the blood
