Hidden in the deserts sand
Forgotten for so very long
Dead eyes with a secret stare
To the ones they lived among

Rise!
From the dust of times upon
Reign!
With revenge and terror on

Don't you break the silence
From a whisper to a scream
In their eyes you see the madness
To reality from a dream

Don't wake the dead - Leave them alone
Don't wake the dead - Let them rest in peace
For the evil curse - For the lives they lived
Don't wake the dead - Let them rest in peace...

Dirt and ashes in their eyes
Crawling maggots gleaming bones
They await their time to rise
To ride out under bloodred skies

Don't you break the old seal
Leave the doorway shut and locked
They return from the underworld
To walk among the living now

Screams of the tortured
The echoes return
Long forgotten cries
Now they will be heard
Empires gonna fall - Kingdoms turn to dust
Realms gonna burn
But the ancient warning calls...
