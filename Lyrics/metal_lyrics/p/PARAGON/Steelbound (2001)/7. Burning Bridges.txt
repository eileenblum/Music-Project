I'm like you - You are like me
Together in the cage of life
Living our lives of no tomorrows
Walking on the razors edge
A mighty spell that keeps us alive
Forced to live a life thats spent
Deep in our heart it cuts like a knife
The memories we've never had

We shall unite
Out of the shadows into the light
Showing our might
Blasting the sinners out of sight

Burning all bridges left behind
No more fears to hide
Takin' the future in our stride
Don't believe in lies no more
Burning all bridges left behind
We're the armies of the world
Our freedom's call is gonna rise
And we're burning - burning
Burning all the bridges down

This is my life - And it's yours too
Implanted thoughts we must obbey
Wasting our time on trails of wisdom
Yet ruled by thev DNA
See myself when I look in your eyes
Come and share my lonely life
There's no chance for your disguise
You better join me to survive

In the end of all time
Breakin' the spell upon our minds
Sunset for the eternal night
Settin' the bridges on fire...
