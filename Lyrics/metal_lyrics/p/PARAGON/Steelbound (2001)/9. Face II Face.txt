The sound of the anthem echoes through the hall
The fighters are entering the pit
Lights are going down excitement starts to mount
Who's gonna fall who will take the hit

Eye to eye and one on one
Deadly tension in the ring
Blood on blood so face your fear
Meet your fate - your time is here

Face to face - life or death
Challengers drawing their knifes
Face to face - life or death
Only one gets out alive
Steel to blood - blood on steel
Only the strong will survive
Steel to blood - blood on steel
Only one gets out alive

Exploding muscles the crowd begins to roar
Their faces expressions of war
Merciless killers clashing in the cage
Blood and sweat is dripping on the floor

Fight to live and fight to kill
Death's the only referee
Trapped inside the hall of pain
Only one man will remain
