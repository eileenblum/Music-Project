Dusty sunlight - a dirty window
A broken leave lifeless on my bed
A breeze has captured the final echoes
Of the last words she said

Gone in the morning - I'll come with the night
Nothing ever changes - all remains the same
Day after day - night after night
Forever lost - I must remain

Freeze the moment - forget your fears now
Immortal souls speaking without words
We share the same dream - all that you know
Living our lives in different worlds

Creatures of the night
We are the shadows of death
Hiding from the light
We're the gods of wrath
Immortal we are
Sinners as we are
Listen to the lonely call
The call of the damned
