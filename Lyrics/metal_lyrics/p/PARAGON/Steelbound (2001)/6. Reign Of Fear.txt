On wings of fire they rip through the skies
Bringing on death from above
Spreading destruction night after night
A spilling of innocent blood
Raging fear in the hearts of mankind
An unknown force from beyond
Vastly superior they meet no resistance
Taking whatever they want

Sacrificing human life
Free us from the curse
Calling unto ancient gods
Praying for a release

Never surrender
Fight the reign of fear
Better to die than to live
Under the reign of fear
The reign of fear

Nocturnal abductors take you away
To places of torment and fear
Where desperate screams are never heard
The odour of death in the air
Experimenting on human flesh
Their aim is total control
Mindless creatures being created
Slaves without a soul

Gather around human resistance
Defiance burns in our hearts
Destiny's calling for death or glory
Mankind get ready for war
