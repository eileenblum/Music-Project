Ages ago - bodies were burned
In rituals of pain and blood
The demon inside - the corpse has been cursed
They are serving the dark lord

Watching the changes of times
Watching the change of the signs
Chronist of the wars of the world
A life that never ends
No punishment for all the sins
Ruler of the dark - the black lord

Looking for the sins of the flesh
Life without fear - there is no pain
We're everywhere in space and in time
The secrets we hide are arcane

Tears - Tears of the damned
When will I ever be free
Tears - Tears of the damned
Lord of blood forever chainedsteel
Only the strong will survive
Steel to blood - blood on steel
Only one gets out alive

Where is the light
Where is the sun
Longing for a morning dew
A ray of light to come
Never be free
Never again
Spreading the desease on and on
