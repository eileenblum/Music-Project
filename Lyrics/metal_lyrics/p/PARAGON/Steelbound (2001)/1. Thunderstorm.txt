Thunder brakes the silence of the eternal night
Lightning striking in the dark but no rain in sight
Dust in the end
Lashing the land
Leaving no place to hide
Visions are real
The end is revealed
Dryness in the high tide

Dehydrated men
Unknown survivors
Digging for water in desert's sand
Bare bones and dry winds
The graves of the older
And in the sun they will be burned

Thunderstorm - turn the page
Thunderstorm - bring the rain - end the night

No mercy in the wastelands of the sun-burned world
A new race in charge on human heads a reward
Crying in pain
Screams that remain
Howling winds in the night
In the ruins they hide
The day is the night
Sick in the dust of time

Thunderstorm - turn the page
Thunderstorm - bring the rain
Long time ago
Our planet was alive
Thunderstorm - bring the rain - end the night
