We are the chosen - the very last ones
Insane survivors of the final war
Ripping through the ruins
We are the ones
Slaying the humans
Till they scream for more

Our hate is not a crime
By the meatless bones shine...

Bow your head
On your knees
The killers are here
Close your eyes
On your knees
The death squad's here

Serving the wargods in temples of blood
On through all the dark ages of mankind
The forces are with us
Together as one
The kingdom of pain
Hate's in our minds

Machines roar in the night
By the sacred swords shine
