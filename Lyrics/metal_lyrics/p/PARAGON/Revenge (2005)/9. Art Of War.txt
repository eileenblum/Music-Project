Protectors of the realm
A living horror for all the weak
Denying gold and riches
ItÂ´s honor and glory they seek

Their minds wonÂ´t be mislead by love nor hate
To kill is an art performed by the blade

The art of war
Living for the sword
The art of war
Where honorÂ´s the only reward

Severing your head
While your bodyÂ´s rotting on the fields
ShameÂ´s all to fear
The brave and the bold need no shields

They battle one on one - To win or to die
Fame for all eternity - No one can decry

The art of war
Living for the sword
The art of war
Where honorÂ´s the only reward

The art of war
Living for the sword
The art of war
Where honorÂ´s the only reward
