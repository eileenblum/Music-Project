On through the night the alleys
Deserted and alone
Anger is filling our blakened hearts
Finally turned to stone

Out of all bounds
Out to raise hell again
Screaming all around
ItÂ´s your turn to feel the pain

Revenge
Revenge
Hear the screams and yells
Revenge
Revenge
I condemn you to hell

A drop of your blood for each of my teardrops
A curse to bring you down
Vengeance is all I desire
A beast insideÂ´s unbound

Dirty and mean
A taste of the sweetest wine
A killing machine
Is lurking inside my mind

Revenge
Revenge
Hear the screams and yells
Revenge
Revenge
I condemn you to hell

IÂ´ll take your eyes and spit in your face
Tear off your head and dance on your grave
All of your sins you shall repent
I take my pleasure in your punishment

Out of all bounds
Out to raise hell again
Screaming all around
ItÂ´s your turn to feel the pain

Revenge
Revenge
Hear the screams and yells
Revenge
Revenge
I condemn you to hell
