On a green blue desert
IÂ´m drifting on and on
Battle sounds still echo on inside my wicked mind
Muzzle flash in the dawn

On a mighty fortress
Riding on the waves
And the winds are enslaved
Like a smoke-cutting sword
Raping the elements
As sheÂ´s dancing on our graves

Leading lives of borrowed time
Borrowed time from our fates
Like a knell the shipÂ´s bell chimes
Fragile sounds of hate

No lord nor king or country
Will defeat the sea
Every shotÂ´s a sacrifice
Your blood will set us free

We will survive
Fighting for our lives
The winds of fortune
Always lead us on
Forever free
For the world to see
The fearless masters
Masters of the sea

Servants of the wstern winds
Hail the storms of the north
Captors of the eastern winds
Looting down in the south

No lord nor king or country
Will defeat the sea
Every shotÂ´s a sacrifice
Your blood will set us free

We will survive
Fighting for our lives
The winds of fortune
Always lead us on
Forever free
For the world to see
The fearless masters
Masters of the sea

Look up to the southern sky
My final sunsetÂ´s gonna rise
My spirit will return one day
I swear revenge and close my eyes

The black flag
Will rescue me
Our black flag
Will reign the sea

From the depths of the ocean
WeÂ´ll rise to plunder all
We sail towards the yaws of hell
On decks of blood youÂ´ll crawl!

Fire!
Open fire!
The skull on black shall never fall

Rapiers, cutlasses held up high
Laughter of marauding  hordes
Screams of those doomed to die
As blood is dripping from the swords

Born by kings and queens
And the pure will to live
To kill and to careen
Always take and never give

Follow the pirates call
When youÂ´re lost at all
WeÂ´re all for one
And one for all

We will survive
Fighting for our lives
The winds of fortune
Always lead us on
Forever free
For the world to see
The fearless masters
Masters of the sea
