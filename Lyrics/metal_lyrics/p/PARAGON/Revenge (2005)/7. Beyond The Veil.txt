Clenching my fists in the darkness
I can feel shadows drawing near
A pounding heart that breaks the silence
So full of life and full of fear

Hear the battleÂ´s thunder as the clouds increase
Time will come to stand or fall
Demons of the land - Ghosts of the seas
Dressep up for the evil ball

Glory to the blood bound brothers
The hounds of hell
For the darkness will prevail
Demons of the seven seas
To thy spirits we are sworn
WeÂ´ve setting sail
From beyond the veil

See the grim smile on our faces
Determination in our eyes
Past and future are embracing
As the wind is lashing on the skies

Hear the battleÂ´s thunder as the clouds increase
Time will come to stand or fall
Demons of the land - Ghosts of the seas
Dressep up for the evil ball

Glory to the blood bound brothers
The hounds of hell
For the darkness will prevail
Demons of the seven seas
To thy spirits we are sworn
WeÂ´ve setting sail
From beyond the veil

Time to feed the fire
For the truth unfold
Take up the gauntlet
In the hour of the bold

Glory to the blood bound brothers
The hounds of hell
For the darkness will prevail
Demons of the seven seas
To thy spirits we are sworn
WeÂ´ve setting sail
From beyond the veil
