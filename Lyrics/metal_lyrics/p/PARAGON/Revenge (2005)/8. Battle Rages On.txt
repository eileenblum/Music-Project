Another night in this burning hell
Mind the reaperÂ´s eyes
HeÂ´s out in the fields
All the doubts illusions and fears
When time is up the horror reveals
Out in the fields

Glory for you and me
Got to try and dare
Here is decay to see
Blood everywhere

Shouts of joy
Tears of laughter and pain
And all your deeds shall remain
Screams of death
Standing relentless and strong
The battle is raging on

Constant barrage all night and day
But when silence is falling
Death is near
Pay with blood for every inch
Crimson tides are washing away all your tears
As the reaper appears

Glory for you and me
Got to try and dare
Here is decay to see
Blood everywhere

Shouts of joy
Tears of laughter and pain
And all your deeds shall remain
Screams of death
Standing relentless and strong
The battle is raging on

Shouts of joy
Tears of laughter and pain
And all your deeds shall remain
Screams of death
Standing relentless and strong
The battle is raging on
