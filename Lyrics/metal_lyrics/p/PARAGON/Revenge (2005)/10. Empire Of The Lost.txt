Silence - Nothing but silence
All around me now
Nothing - Nothing remained
Nothing but emptiness
In a world bare of life

The screams echo on
On the wind in the empty streets
Telling the tale
Of the final defeat

Guardians of the dying flame
Facing the final storm
Damned to be alive
In the empire - Empire of the lost
Sole survivors
In the ashes of yesterday
Let down by the gods
In the empire - Empire of the lost

Ruins and rubble, records of the past
They are standing sentinel in the twilight of the vast
Burnt down by a fire coming from the sky
Now life is sentenced - The world is doomed to die

No turning back
No way to undo whatÂ´s been done
The final night is falling
All will be gone

Guardians of the dying flame
Facing the final storm
Damned to be alive
In the empire - Empire of the lost
Sole survivors
In the ashes of yesterday
Let down by the gods
In the empire - Empire of the lost

Will life return - what is to come?
Will it rise up once again when we are gone?
Buried in the dust of time - Our destiny is signed
This is our legacy - We are leaving  the world behind

No turning back
No way to undo whatÂ´s been done
The final night is falling
All will be gone

Guardians of the dying flame
Facing the final storm
Damned to be alive
In the empire - Empire of the lost
Sole survivors
In the ashes of yesterday
Let down by the gods
In the empire - Empire of the lost
