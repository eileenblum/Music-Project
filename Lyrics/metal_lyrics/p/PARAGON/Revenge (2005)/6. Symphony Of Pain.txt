Below the floor in the attic
Chained by a spell
A creature bare of flesh
From the abyss of hell
Unconsidered by a drip of blood
You broke the seal
And now a vicious demon
Is about to reveal

Satisfy the hunger
Feed me!
Let me plunge into flesh and blood
And let me play to you

The symphony of pain
Written down in hell
Welcome to the reign
Welcome! To my symphony of pain

My powers are growing
Night after night
As you bring on the victims
To please my appetite
Unspeakeable torture
I had to bear
But now IÂ´m rising up
I will leave my sepulchral lair

IÂ´m on a blood marked trail of wrath
Follow me!
Undead among the living
IÂ´m gonna play

The symphony of pain
Written down in hell
Welcome to the reign
Welcome! To my symphony of pain

The symphony of pain
Written down in hell
Welcome to the reign
Welcome! To my symphony of pain
