A poisoned knife behind my back
Innocent eyes - feigned respect
You swallowed all the years of trust
Now I spit at you in pure disgust

And now your final game
Your life is at the stake
No more lies - take the blame
We understood your fake

Traitor
Hang him high
You gonna pay for all the lies
Traitor
Torture is my name
You gonna burn in endless pain

You bite the hand of those who feed
A bastard grown from evil seed
Purified by fire - in pain you gonna scream
As the flesh is burning up - your soul may redeem

In the end the truth has won
Your life is at stake
Decapitated, betraying scum
We understood your fake

Traitor
Hang him high
You gonna pay for all the lies
Traitor
Torture is my name
You gonna burn in endless pain

In the end the truth has won
Your life is at stake
Decapitated, betraying scum
We understood your fake

Traitor
Hang him high
You gonna pay for all the lies
Traitor
Torture is my name
You gonna burn in endless pain
