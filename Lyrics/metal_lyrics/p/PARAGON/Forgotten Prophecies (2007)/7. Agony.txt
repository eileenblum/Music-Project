Fading pictures in a desert's heat
Of a world that died so long ago
Long lost forgotten dreams
And broken heroes died in the fields
Blood's preventing them from rust
We were crushed by the wheels

In bloodless times
Obey the machines
With every breath
Hail the machines

Life in agony under the spell
Live and die -- To be reborn
Reborn in hell

Ancient scrolls have turned to dust
Lonely preachers lost their trust
Metalian deities
Feed on human daily sacrifice
Beyond those leaden clouds
They die with open eyes

Life in agony under the spell
The time won't tell no more tales
Pain and agony -- Bearing the spell
Live and die -- Only to be reborn
Reborn in hell

Hours, months and years did pass  - So much wasted time
Not to dare to move or think -- Staring at the signs
Raping, abusing, plunder and cut out your heart
Chained and locked in for 10 bloody years in the dark
Watch the people pray for some kind of heaven
Listen to the screams and cries last for 24/7
The dreams of freedom died long ago in the night
A state of despair killed your strong will to fight
