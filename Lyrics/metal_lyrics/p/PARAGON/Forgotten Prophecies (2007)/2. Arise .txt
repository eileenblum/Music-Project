The hour of decision -- Now it's close at hand
To end their reign, tear down the walls, unify the land
Break the chain of command -- Cut the wires now
Bloodlust in our eyes -- Through their ranks we'll plough

Decode the words -- A strike full of hate
Unlock the doors -- A strike of the blade

Arise! Out of the dark
Heroes of the realm returneth
Arise! Out of the dust
Arise! Shine forevermore

Frozen mutants tremble before they turn to dust
Now we will kill, we will win, we'll be victorious
Time's up for the palace on this melting ground
A ray of sun breaks the ice with a cracking sound

Deep down in caverns -- Below the poisoned waterline
The sound of howling sirens crawls into their minds
Corpses end their endless sleep in a machine's sigh
Smoke and fire, tumbling walls -- Fear opens up their eyes
A Lament in the guild of thieves -- Cut and chopped off hands
A senseless beg for mercy a blackened, bloody end
