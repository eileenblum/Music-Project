Self-imprisoned lords of doom
Endless sleep in hidden cells
Close to hell in frozen rooms
In a cyber world they dwell

Ancient brains to control the wastelands
Mindless guardians in control
Electric shadows in the poisoned air
With invisible webs they haul

Obey souleaters
Feeding on your dreams
Reigning in eternal dark
Land of souleaters
Man-machines
On and on they're ripping you apart

The immortal Pharaohs
Deadly thoughts rush through the wire
Unbent minds will overflow
Shocked by the minds whip's fire
