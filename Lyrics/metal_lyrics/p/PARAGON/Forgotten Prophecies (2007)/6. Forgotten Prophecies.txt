Beyond all the shadows -- Search behind the black gate
Your journey through darkness and cold shall begin
Forgotten paths in secrecy
An ancient silver plate
A garden of horror and fear
Where the truth lies in

Pages crumble -- In the dust of time
Etched new wisdoms on book's spines

Forever lost in time
Clutch the broken straw
Those who believe
In the lost forgotten prophecies

Annoying voices will infiltrate your mind
The spotlight's on you -- The clouds shall move aside
Remember all the prophet's words;
A blind shouldn't lead the blind
This won't be a childish dream
Nor a supernatural ride

Revealed forces of the universe
A look through the eyeglass in reverse

Forever lost in time
Clutch the broken straw
Those who believe
In the tales of war

Awaiting their time
Waiting for a sign
Fulfill the lost
Forgotten prophecies
