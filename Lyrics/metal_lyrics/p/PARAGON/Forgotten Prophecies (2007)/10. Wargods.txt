Fear the line of fire crawling through the night
Unleashed forces are heading for the fight
Legions of the damned hold their weapons high
Riding on the wind a flying battle cry

The terror has arrived again
Colored faces with no names
Enslave, rape and kill again
Gleaming ashes to remain

Wargods of death
Cursed and damned forevermore
Wargods of death
Undead warriors created for the fight
Bringing war...

Servants of the tyrants, deadly tools of hate
Seek, destroy and plunder -- Murder, terminate
Choose to run or choose to hide, fear's on your side
There's no peace and freedom no way to stay alive
