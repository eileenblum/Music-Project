Sudden ambush
Dead of the night
Disintegrating
Shadows to light

Know that the run from the law don't make no sense at all
When the signs differ now from a block to the block
And the wolves and the snakes as they wait for our fall
And they'll feast on your blood and your shocks

Back to back the brothers fighting
Chains and maze beat down
Bastards screaming mutants howling
Freezing time as one fell down

And the smoke is rising
All pictures frozen in
A false move so fatal
A mask of horror and sin
Face of death

Eyes wide open
Adrenaline
Another soul
Caught by death

Fast is the end of your life always unexpected
Black is the curtain that falls down on you
Souls that flare up and then cease to exist
In a blink of an eye and in hours for you

Stabbing knives -- An ancient slow-mo
Blood's painting pictures red
A scream will end this illusion
Looking down find your friend dead
