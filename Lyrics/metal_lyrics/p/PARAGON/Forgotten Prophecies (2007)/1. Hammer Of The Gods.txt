Deadly attack at the sirens call
A thunderous sound as the weapon falls
Hammering fear inside your heart
Try to face the danger ripping you apart

Suicidal weapon
For the final attack
Face the last curtain
There's no turning back

Feel the hammer of the gods
Mankind is bound to fall
Feel the hammer of the gods
Certain death from above

Erased landscapes and poisoned seas
Nuclear winter devastates your dreams
Burning cities and melting flesh
All you loved has turned to ash

Path of destruction
The signs of defeat
Stand up and fight
Or die on your knees

Total destruction, nuclear waste
Masters of power digging our graves
Terminal war abandoned all hope
The neck of mankind caught in a rope
