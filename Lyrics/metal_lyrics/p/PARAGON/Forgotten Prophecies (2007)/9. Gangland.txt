Fear and terror rule the land
All evil words made flesh
Heroes under bloodstained sand
The reaper's harvest -- Threshed

The blackened forces
Demons out of hell
Like winds of fire
From a wizard's spell

Gangland -- Land of glory and fame
Gangland -- Deserts with no names
The orders are gone and buried in the sand
Gangland -- Fear is all that remains

Cracking whips and rattling chains
Cries for mercy in the air
Leather hordes ride out again
Leaving nothing but despair

Schemes in the fire -- Once a maid now a bitch
She laughs as you suffer down in hell's ditch
Used and disposed -- Tamed and enslaved
When the de-evolution is digging our grave
