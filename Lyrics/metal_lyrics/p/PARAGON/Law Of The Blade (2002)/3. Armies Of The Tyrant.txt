Hear the distant thunder â rising from the plains
The sound of marching legions on their way
The ground is shaking â the threat is drawing near
Our hearts freeze in terror feel the fear

No signs of life in their eyes
No cruelty theyâve left undone
The silence is gone - time to realize
The bloodshed has begun

Armies of the tyrant
Following the seal
The armies of the black spreading fear
Armies of the tyrant
Following the seal
Ainât there a way to escape from the seal

Unseen they passed us â an eerie scenery
Silent slaves of the war machinery
Forced by their commanders â the power of their will
Driven to destroy and to kill
