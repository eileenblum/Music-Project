A beam of light out of the shadows
Darkness casts a spell upon us
Burning alien rays leading the blind
Spellbound and frozen to ice
Chained and hypnotized
Madness is raging in our minds

Millions of miles in a blink of the eye
The sense of time is gone
Unknown dimensions â weâre a part of the sky
The forces of darkness have won

Abducted now
Taken away into the night

The open gate - closed behind us
A trail of light ahead of us
The visions in our minds are running wild
Screams of pain make us shiver
Journey through an unknown river
Nightmare and reality collide

Abducted now
Taken away into the night
Abducted now
So far beyond of all the light
