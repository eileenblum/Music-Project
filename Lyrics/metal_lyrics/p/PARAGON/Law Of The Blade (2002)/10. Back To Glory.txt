Moonlightâs shine
Feel the emptiness inside
Iâm all alone
Silence all around
Back in the reality but the vision still remains
I look in the mirror and Iâll never be the same

Voices
Calling me back again
Prayers
Towards the stars I send

We, the knights
Defenders of the right
United pride
Fought the battles side by side
These memories had changed my life for now and for all time
Counting scars on my face and Iâm waiting for a sign

Misery and pain
Honesty and fame
Hopeâs a burning flame
Back to glory
To stand in the light
To stand every fight
Dreams will never die
Back to glory

Once in a lifetime
To take the chance of fame
Forever and ever
They will know my name
