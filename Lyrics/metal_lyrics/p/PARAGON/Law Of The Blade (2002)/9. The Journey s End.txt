When the night is over
And the smoke has finally cleared
Weâre the last survivors
Without fear

The battlefield in silence
A solemn heroes grave
We walk among the ruins
We â the brave

Memories like dust in the wind
Finally at the journeyâs end
Remember the time â I wonât repent
The traveller at the journeyâs end
The journeyâs end

So lost without a trace
Iâm lost in my memories
Canât imagine their faces
In secrecy

Reflecting their words
The alliance weâve sworn
The hymns that Iâve heard
Now â I am torn
