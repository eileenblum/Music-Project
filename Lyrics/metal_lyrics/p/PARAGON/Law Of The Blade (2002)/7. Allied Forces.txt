Down below in the darkness
Behind secret doors
Thereâs a light to guide us
In our blackest hours
Long forgotten but still alive
Sworn together on a rotten ground
From everywhere the fighters arrive
On to the battle weâre bound

The fierce and the wild
Legions of the light
Standing side by side
Into the final fight

No more sorrows - No more pain
Weâre breaking the chains
Break the spell â Arise tonight
Weâre the forces of light
Feel the power â Feel the force
We show no remorse
To free the world â Weâll ride tonight
In for the kill - The forces of light

Spreading the message
All across the land
We shall end the dark age
The futureâs in our hands
Determination in our eyes
The tables have turned
Finally our powers have grown
To arise from the underworld

Strong of heart and mind
Weâre gonna end oppression
The darkness will be forced
Into submission

Determination
We shall defy
End the dark reign
Our time has come
