The daylight flows down the hills
Reveals a long deserted plain
Vultures are waiting â feel the chill
The blood is boiling in our veins

Forced to believe in the reality of dreams
Stranded on a strange world
Open our eyes to a nightmare of a scene
Stranded on a hidden world

A world behind the sun
Black and grey shadow world
The lord of evil has won
Grey and black shadow world

We look above and feel the fear
The greatness of a second moon
As other planets seem so near
A dying warrior beats his drum

A light breeze uncovers human bones
Relicts of the unfortunate ones
The red sand nearly buries us
Creating new desert dunes
In the distance across the plain
We see a range of black hills
Silent voices whispering their name
Where the lord of evil dwells
