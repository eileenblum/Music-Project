Sick and wounded â and close to death
Step by step through the desert sand
Burning our lunges with hot breath
A nameless torture without end

Hope and desire
Merged on a trail of fire
Agony and pain
Praying for a desert rain

The crack of the whip
The beat of the drum
The horror seems to last forever
Crossing the land
Weâre crossing the sea
Chained and bound together

Across the wastelands
Beyond the seas
Onward to an unknown fate we ride
Across the wastelands
The barren earth
Facing our fate side by side
Side by side

Passing galleys on a lake of sulphur
Bloodred sunset â yellow water
Increasing clouds of poisoned vapour
Hear the echoes of the tyrants laughter

Rain and our tears
Mixed on a sea of fears
Screams and cries
Stars of an endless night
