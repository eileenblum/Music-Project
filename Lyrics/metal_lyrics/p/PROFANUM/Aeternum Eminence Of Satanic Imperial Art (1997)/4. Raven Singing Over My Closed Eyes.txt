Far beyond the frontier of east I come
In the shadow of raven wings
To meet the moon rising up on the sky
To meet Him before came over land of my damnation
Far beyond the circle of this kingdom
I shall dwell
In the shadow of raven wings
To seek the moon of my dream
Moon with has never rose so far
Moon which never saw this land's night
Slept over sacred circle
