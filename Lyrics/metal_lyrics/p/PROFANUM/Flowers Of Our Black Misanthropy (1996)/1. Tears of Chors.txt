The face of the moon is rising over the nightSilver face in pagan blazeof eternal star's eyes... The touch of soft lightFills with dream virgin forest immensity...Vampiric silence of shining blacknessas sword rapesSharp cold steel...silence First scream from child of nightThe light of moon enthrones the princeDancing shadows riseas the realm of Chors...Join the great feast of dream,Ancient forest wind...Until dawn abysmal sleepgates await Tears of Chors invite...
