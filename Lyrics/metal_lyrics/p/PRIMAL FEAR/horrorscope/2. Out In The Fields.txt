[unreleased cover version of the Phil Lynott/Gary Moore song]

It doesn't matter
if you're wrong or if you're right.
It makes no difference
if you're black or if you're white.

All men are equal
till the victory is won.
No colour or religion
ever stopped the bullet from a gun.

Out in the fields.
The fighting has begun.
Out on the streets.
They're falling one by one.
Out from the skies.
A thousand more will die each day.
Death is just a heartbeat away.

It doesn't matter
if you're left or to the right.
Don't try to hide behind the cause,
they want to fight.

There'll be no prisoners taken
when the day is done.
No flag, no uniform
ever stopped the bullet from a gun.

Out in the fields.
The fighting has begun.
Out on the streets.

They're falling one by one.
Out from the skies.
A thousand more will die each day.
Death is just a heartbeat away.

There's no communication,
noone to take the blame.
The cries of every nation,
they're falling on deaf ears again.

Out in the fields.
Out in the fields.
They're falling one by one.
Out in the fields.
No flag has ever stopped
the bullet from a gun.

Death is just a heartbeat away.
Out in the fields.
A heartbeat away.
Out in the fields.
Death is just a heartbeat away.
Out in the fields.
A heartbeat away.
Out in the fields.

In the fields.
The fighting has begun.
Out on the streets.
They're falling one by one.
Out from the skies.
A thousand more will die each day.

OUT!
