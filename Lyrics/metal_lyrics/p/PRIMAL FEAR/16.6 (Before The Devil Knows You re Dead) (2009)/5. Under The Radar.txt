May lightning strike me
As I roam the blood red skies
I wear no armour, no disguise
Fearless figher
I'm coming around the bend
My heart's my weapon, my defense

Strike like the lightning
Out of the dark
Right out of frozen skies
Into your heart

Racing the ages
I'm bending time and space
Under the radar I will race
Say your prayers
To a hero on parole
No one was ever in control

Strike like the lightning
Chasing the storm
Where ever thunder's rolling
I'm coming home
Strike like the lightning
Under the radar

[Solo]

Strike like the lightning
Chasing the storm
Where ever thunder's rolling
I'm coming home
Under the radar
Out of the dark
Right out of frozen skies
Into your heart

As I roam the blood red skies
I wear no armour, no disguise
I'm a fearless fighter
