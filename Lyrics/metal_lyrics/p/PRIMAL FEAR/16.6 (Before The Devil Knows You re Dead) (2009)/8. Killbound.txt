Ever since I was born I was different to the others
No one ever like my company
Virtual thrills feed my hunger
Six six six is an admissible number

Hello - here I go - got my six gun loaded
Anytime - anyplace - I pull the trigger on the way

I'm killbound
Killbound - A crossed viper
Killbound
I'll take no prisoners

The Cops to the left - the killers to the right
I am ready to take every fight

Hello - here I go - got my six gun loaded
Anytime - anyplace - I pull the trigger on the way

I'm killbound
Killbound - A crossed viper
Killbound
I'll take no prisoners

Ain't no fear in the heart of a killer
There's no way to stop this thriller

Hello - here I go - got my six gun loaded
Anytime - anyplace - I pull the trigger on the way

I'm killbound
Killbound - A crossed viper
Killbound
I'll take no prisoners
I'm killbound
Killbound - A crossed viper
Killbound
I'll take no prisoners / Killbound
