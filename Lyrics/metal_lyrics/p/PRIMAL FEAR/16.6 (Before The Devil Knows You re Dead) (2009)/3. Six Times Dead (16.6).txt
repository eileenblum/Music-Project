Yes we're alive - with seven lives
Not forever 'cause forever is a lie

Not crucify keep your coffin nails
All these obvious lies have failed

We don't know
What you've been told
We will show you

16.6 all over this world
16.6 it's true what you've heard
Six times dead and we're back on the track again

16.6 all over this world
We're back from Hell by a sixth rebirth
Breaking them bones and sticks
With 16.6
16.6

No sacrament - no sacrilege
Has brought us back from this awful place

One more minute - control the pain
Hear you breath and go entirely insane

We don't know
What you've been told
We will show you

16.6 all over this world
16.6 it's true what you've heard
Six times dead and we're back on the track again

16.6 all over this world
We're back from Hell by a sixth rebirth
Breaking the bones and sticks
With 16.6
16.6
