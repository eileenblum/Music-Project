Drive the Devil out of me
My soul is cryin' for liberty
Demon blood runs through my veins
The Beast will have no mercy can't you see
My nature is oppressed by sin
The incarnated pest within
Satan's curse hangs over me
Water vaporizes at my skin

There's only one who can see
The evil beast inside me
Only the cross heals my heart
I need to see:

The Exorcist
Come take the fight with the beast
Demons no longer resist
Smoking a pipe with the priest
I want to break free

The Exorcist
The Exorcist

Strapped and gagged into my bed
An iron crown upon my head
Finger scratch upon the wall
Maggots on my skin - my eyes are red
A trident sign adorns my skin
Angels came and carved it in
Dr. Demon on his rounds
Sister pain says: let the show begin

There's only one who can see
The evil beast inside me
Only the cross heals my heart
I need to see:

The Exorcist
Come take the fight with the beast
Demons no longer resist
Smoking a pipe with the priest
I want to break free
