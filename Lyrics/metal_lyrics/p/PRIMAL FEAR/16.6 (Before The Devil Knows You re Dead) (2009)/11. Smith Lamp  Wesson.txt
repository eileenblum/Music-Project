You've turned your back on me
And left me alone
I saw this house, so high
- Will it take me to the sky
Another life, another soul
Taken by yourself esteem
16.6 floors to realize my dream

There was just one more way
And the ice cold wind howled through the night
I heard a distant scream
I'd never believed the door extreme
There's just a one way street
Without an exit for us all to leave And here we stay and nothing more to say

Let me burn - burn me alive
Got a bullet with your name on it
Hits you straight between the eyes
Let me burn - burn me alive
Guess it's time to teach a lesson
Gonna pack my Smith &amp; Wesson

Compensator - regulator - there's an open door
One way will lead to Heaven
On a 16.6 floor
Immortal eyes and dirty lies
Free me from my pain
Will there ever be a place where all remains

There was just one more way
And the ice cold wind howled through the night
I heard a distant scream
I'd never believed the door extreme
There's just a one way street
Without an exit for us all to leave And here we stay and nothing more to say

Let me burn - burn me alive
Got a bullet with your name on it
Hits you straight between the eyes
Let me burn - burn me alive
Guess it's time to teach a lesson
Gonna pack my Smith &amp; Wesson
