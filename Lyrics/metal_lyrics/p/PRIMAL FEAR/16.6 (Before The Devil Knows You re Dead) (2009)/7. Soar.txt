Let me live and let me breath
Even if my anger seethes
And I have learn... my lesson well
Never again, never again
I will hear them scream "amen"
No solution, all system's failed

Hammer is rising, march off to war
No compromising
Spread your wings and soar

Full emotion, dark devotion
Here's the second law of motion
Don't be scared to fly alone
It's my fate to put it straight
The heartless monster will create
2012 and 16.6.

Hammer is rising, march off to war
No compromising
Spread your wings and soar

Annihilation - radiation
A warning sign for every nation
But I'm not dead and gone
Never again, never again
Goodbye and prayer failed
Your final hour... the end is done

Hammer is rising, march off to war
No compromising
Spread your wings and soar

Hammer is rising, march off to war
No compromising
Spread your wings and soar
