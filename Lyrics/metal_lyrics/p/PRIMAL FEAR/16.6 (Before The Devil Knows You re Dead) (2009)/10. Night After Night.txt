Can't get rid of this taste of blood
Can't erase the face that hunts me
A call from the shadows below
A serenade of haunting voices

Someone is digging my grave
Waiting for my body to arrive
My soul will burn alive
My blood is cold as ice

Night after night
I hear them calling from the dark without light
Fight after fight
I keep on falling, deeper and deeper below
To the world that I don't wanna know
Life after life

The darkness will fall again
Chased by the dead and the lonely
I know that's my own devour
The evil inside growing stronger

Someone is digging my grave
Waiting for my body to arrive
But my soul will burn alive
My blood is cold as ice

Night after night
I hear them calling from the dark without light
Fight after fight
I keep on falling, deeper and deeper below
To the world that I don't wanna know
Life after life

Won't fall asleep, I will stay you light
It's not the right time - for your devastation
Your evil mind defying the curse
Won't let go

Night after night
I hear them calling from the dark without light
Fight after fight
I keep on falling, deeper and deeper below
To the world that I don't wanna know
Life after life
