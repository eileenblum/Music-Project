Destiny, no question where I've been
Where's the sense My view is getting cold as ice
Living sin, a look an evil grin
You cheat and win
Danger and humans to the bomb

Religions are walking to the war
Sacred human rights
I highly doubt the prophecy
Egos torn apart

And when the sun will never rise
The pain grows deep inside you
Give me your hand and let us
Leave the world behind the curtain
Is there's a future is there not
We never lose our courage
I'm not afraid, that we will
Break the chains of lies and promises

Faded the past even lost memories
I saw their treasure burn
Just wanna live without concerns

There's always a risk in good and bad
Pressure and lost control
I go a silent, lonely way
Egos torn apart

And when the sun will never rise
The pain grows deep inside you
Give me your hand and let us
Leave the world behind the curtain
Is there's a future is there not
We never lose our courage
I'm not afraid, that we will
Break the chains of lies and promises

"Is there anybody out there who cares about
What we're doing to our world?
I don't think our children ever understand
What we have done to this planet! It's time to react NOW!"

[Solo]

Religions are walking to the war
Sacred human rights
I highly doubt the prophecy
Egos torn apart

And when the sun will never rise
The pain grows deep inside you
Give me your hand and let us
Leave the world behind the curtain
Is there's a future is there not
We never lose our courage
I'm not afraid, that we will
Break the chains of lies and promises
