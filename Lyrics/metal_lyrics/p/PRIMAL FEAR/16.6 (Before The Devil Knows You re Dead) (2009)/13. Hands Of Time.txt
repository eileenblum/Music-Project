[Magnus]
The hands of time are moving on
Didn't know it's been so long
Clocks are ticking time away
I'm sad to say

[Mat]
So tired of waking up from this dream
I'm wishing that it would go on
Though I know it could be wrong
I keep holding on forever
When seconds turn into eternity
And screams become a sigh
The rain is my only friend
So unpredictable and yet so destined
For loose it in the end

[Henny]
The hands of time are movin' on
Didn't know it's been so long
Clocks are ticking time away
It's sad to say

[Mat]
It's hard to say, I love someone
It's even harder that we're done
Now I've got nothing left to lose
My lost soul and except what I have on

[Mat/Henny]
The hands of time are movin' on
Didn't know it's been so long
Clocks are ticking time away
It's sad to say

The hands of time are movin' on
Didn't know it's been so long
Clocks are ticking time away
It's sad to say

[Ralf]
Time is running, Time is running out
Time is running and takes the time away

[Mat]
Who was right and who was wrong
Who was cool and who was strong
When all colors turn to grey
When silence speaks louder than words
My sins are washed away

[Magnus / Mat / Henny]
The hands of time are movin' on
Didn't know it's been so long
Clocks are ticking time away
It's sad to say
The hands of time are movin' on
Didn't know it's been so long
Clocks are ticking time away
It's sad to say

[Ralf]
Time is running, time is running out
Time is running and takes the time away
Time is running, time is running out
Time is running and takes the time away

[Mat]
So tired of waking up from this dream
I wishing that it would go on
Though I know I could be wrong
I keep holding on forever
