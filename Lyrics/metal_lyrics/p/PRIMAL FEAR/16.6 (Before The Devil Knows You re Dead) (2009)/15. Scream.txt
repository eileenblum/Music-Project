[Bonus Track]YOU LOOK INTO THE MIRROR AND SEE THE WALK OF LIFE
THE FLAME IN YOUR HEARTâS STILL BURNINâ - NO ONE CAN CHANGE THAT
ALWAYS BEEN A TYPE OF WINNER NO MATTER IF LIFE TREATS YOU HARD
NEVER GIVE IN NO SURRENDER â LEADING - SUCCEEDING

YOU CAN TAKE IT ALL
JUST GO AND BREAK THE WALL
GO ON MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
CAUSE IN THE DARKEST NIGHT
YOU SEE A LIGHT SO BRIGHT
AND IT IS SHINING JUST FOR YOU

SCREAM - SHOW THE WORLD YOUâRE RIGHT
SCREAM â EVEN IF IT HURTS
SCREAM â IT WILL LAST FOREVER
SCREAM LIKE ITâS NOW OR NEVER

SCREAM â THEREâS A GOAL IN SIGHT
SCREAM â CAUSE YOUR HEART STILL BURNS
SCREAM â IT WILL LAST FOREVER
SCREAM LIKE ITâS NOW OR NEVER

YOU NEVER SAW THE REASON IN DOING WHAT THEY SAY
ITâS TIME TO GO YOUR OWN WAY â NOW AND FOREVER
YOU NEVER WERE AFRAID TO CARRY RESPONSIBILITY
NO LIVING AT A VENTURE - DEEDS INSTEAD WORDS

YOU CAN TAKE IT ALL
JUST GO AND BREAK THE WALL
GO ON MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
CAUSE IN THE DARKEST NIGHT
YOU SEE A LIGHT SO BRIGHT
AND IT IS SHINING JUST FOR YOU

SCREAM - SHOW THE WORLD YOUâRE RIGHT
SCREAM â EVEN IF IT HURTS
SCREAM â IT WILL LAST FOREVER
SCREAM LIKE ITâS NOW OR NEVER

SCREAM â THEREâS A GOAL IN SIGHT
SCREAM â CAUSE YOUR HEART STILL BURNS
SCREAM â IT WILL LAST FOREVER
SCREAM LIKE ITâS NOW OR NEVER

INSTRUCTIONS â FOREORDINATION
JUST LAWS AND PARAGRAPHS
PROHIBITIONS â POLITICIANS
LIES AND INFIDELITY
