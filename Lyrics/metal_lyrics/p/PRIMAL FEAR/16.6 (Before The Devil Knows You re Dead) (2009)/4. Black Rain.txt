As I watched the rising sun
A walking shadow on the run
There's no hope and there's no anger, I'm defenseless
I stand alone out in the cold
Ten more miles on desert sand
The Earth still shakes - I hear tank shells explode

Is it just a dead memory
Stranded in the thirty third latitude degree
A few words of truth could never lie
Who will kill me - I'm a refuge alive

In and out - I watch the sky explode
Enough - our mission's sold
The flushing black rain kills is all
In and out - I watch the sky explode
Enough - our mission's sold
Even if the black rain kills us all

As men of honour and belief
We never knew our enemies
There's no reason that's worth dying for
As I hear the silence brake
A so called fight, a big mistake
Or was it just to see another thousand die

Under friendly fire of our own crew
Another day will never come true

In and out - I watch the sky explode
Enough - our mission's sold
The flushing black rain kills us all
In and out - I watch the sky explode
Enough - our mission's sold
Even if the black rain kills us all
