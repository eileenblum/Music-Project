Countless miles he carried me
Crossed mountains and the seas
Roaring on I got a mission to complete

Metal fighter, shining brighter

Flying high as we cross the sky
High on those wings
Riding the eagle
High as we cross the sky
Taking the world we'll fly

We travelled through the universe
Supersonic without fear
They tell a tail of an eagle flyin' free

Metal fighter, shining brighter

[Solo]

Flying high as we cross the sky
High on those wings
Riding the eagle
High as we cross the sky
Taking the world we'll fly
High on those wings
Riding the eagle
