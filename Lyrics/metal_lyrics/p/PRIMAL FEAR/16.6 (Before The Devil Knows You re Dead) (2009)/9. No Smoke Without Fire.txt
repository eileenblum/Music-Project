4 A.M. - I couldn't sleep tonight at all
Just lay awake
Once again I made a very big mistake
And turned away
Just wait a minute - I can't take no more
It's cloak and dagger as you slam the door
I fight my demons - I risk it all
I can't believe it

You fire my fate - I opened the gate
Things were better left unsaid
As I crossed the line
There's no smoke without a fire
No smoke without a fire

My one way street
There's no fire without a flame
Not one word spoken
Don't lie to me
'Cause you can't try to break
What's already broken

Where's the fallen angel - take me out of hell
My anger's rising and I feel your spell
I fight my demons and I risk it all
You don't hurt me no more

You fire my fate - I opened the gate
Things were better left unsaid
As I crossed the line
There's no smoke without a fire
No smoke without a fire

No smoke, no smoke without fire

A promise was made to be broken
It looks like I'm losing the fight
