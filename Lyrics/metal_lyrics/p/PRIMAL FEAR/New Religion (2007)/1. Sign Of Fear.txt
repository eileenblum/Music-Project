Do you see me in the light
All the ember I ignite
You can't control my will
I will sign your testament
It's a prophecy, no argument

When the sun goes down, my time has come
You will hear the beat of the drums

[Chorus:]
I'm your death trap
Well I'm your sign of fear
Death trap
You can't disappear
I'm your death trap
You will crawl and taste the mud
Death trap
Until you're drenched in blood

Well my mission will be done
You will hear the sound of a gun
Rising up from the ashes
Only your memory remains
In God we trust

When the sun goes down, my time has come
You will hear the beat of the drums

[Chorus]

My eyes will watching every move
And if you think you're save
Your life will turn to you
