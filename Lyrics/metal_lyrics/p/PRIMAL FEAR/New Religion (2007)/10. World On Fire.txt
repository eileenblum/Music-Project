Riding the wind in Toledo
I will follow the rising sun
With rage and in total control
I'm a hunter till my mission is done

I'm coming after you
I'll see the fear in your eyes
I'm coming after you
You better not look back
'Cause I'm on the attack

Tears of blood in my eyes
The world's set on fire
I will meet you without a defence
A desire to die
I will burn all your lies
And if you're safe
There will be suspense

Chasing the end of the rainbow
A search for the unholy lies
A face that you'll never forget
Your nightmare will cover your eyes

I'm hunting high and low
Every action is asking his price
Tears of blood in my eyes

Tears of blood in my eyes
The world's set on fire
I will meet you without a defence
A desire to die
I will burn all your lies
And if you're safe
There will be suspense
