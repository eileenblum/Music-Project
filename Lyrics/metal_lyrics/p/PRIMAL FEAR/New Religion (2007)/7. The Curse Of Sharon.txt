Shadows in black
As the hour glass cracks
The candlelight's burning
As I realized
The world of tomorrow
The haunted yesterday
Spin the wheel of emotion
As I saw your face....

....For the first time, are we gone
Tomorrow
My final breath, your final tear

Shapes flying high
The taste of pure incense
I hold your shaking hands
Or will holy water heal

In the middle of a long dark lonely road
Will you spread your wings again
Can I cure your lost soul
Tonight and heaven cries
My silent Babylon
It's the curse of Sharon
The curse of Sharon

Our hands tied together
Wired with thorns
I've done everything to help you
At the end of times
Couldn't save you from your fears
Couldn't dry your falling tears
Will it be our last night
How far can we go.......?

....Till the last time, are we gone
Tomorrow
My final breath, your final tear

In the middle of a long dark lonely road
Will you spread your wings again
Can I cure your lost soul
Tonight and heaven cries
My silent Babylon
It's the curse of Sharon
