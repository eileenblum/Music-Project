When the fallen angel calls
And your kingdom slowly falls
Human sacrifice will turn into your
Enemies

There are species you can't buy
Not like your all corrupt alliance
Can see and already feel
The blade of the guillotine

There is no way out
There will be no release
You'll see the light
Sooner than believe
Listen to the story
Your friend the priest will tell
I'm gonna ring the bell

Psycho
Psycho in the air

Sweat is running down your face
You look like a mess - a disgrace
A whining wimp will fall into eternity

There is no way out
There will be no release
You'll see the light
Sooner than believe
Listen to the story
Your friend the priest will tell
I'm gonna ring the bell

Psycho
Psycho in the air
