I feel the oppression
Every time that I think
How time has changed
What I am

I look in the mirror
I don't know who I see
Where is the man
That I've once been

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I feel
That the things I love
Are the things I hate
And sometimes I know
That I'm torn up inside
And the man that I am
Is a man that I don't know

A silence inside me
Quiet and deep
So loud that my ears
Almost bleed

Anxiety is hunting me
Paralyzing my mind
Lying on the ground
I still fall

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I feel
That the things I love
Are the things I hate
And sometimes I know
That I'm torn up inside
And the man that I am
Is a man that I don't know
