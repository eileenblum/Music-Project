The story is over,
It's finished, it is done
The dream that you had
Has vanished in the haze

Standing in front
Of the ruin you've built up
Shocked to the bones
And smashed down

[Bridge:]
When giants fall and angels cry
You know - it's hard to save the day

[Chorus:]
The final word is said and done
The story ends where it began
You have to face the emptiness
There is no way to talk it out
There is no way to work it out
You know that's
When the rain falls down
There is no doubt that you are done
The story ends not yet begun
Come on and face the emptiness
There is no way to hide away
You cannot run you have to stay
Stand still and watch
The rain fall down

The higher you set your goals
The deeper you may fall
Sometimes life
Just isn't fair

You are a restless fighter
You stand up when you fall
Even if you
Can't see it now

[Chorus:]
The final word is said and done
The story ends where it began
You have to face the emptiness
There is no way to talk it out
There is no way to work it out
You know that's
When the rain falls down
There is no doubt that you are done
The story ends not yet begun
Come on and face the emptiness
There is no way to hide away
You cannot run you have to stay
Stand still and watch
The rain fall down
