[I: Fighting The Darkness]

Awakening - I open up my eyes
Befallen me - doomed to this unlife
Still I am determined not to break
I won't let go and let it seal my fate

But I'm falling, deeper
Help me please

I'm fighting the darkness within me
Can you hear my call
Feels like I'm frozen under my skin
I'm forever lost
Here in the shadows in the twilight
Life is eternal and my past is forsaken
I'm fighting the darkness

All that's left is the poison in my veins
Deep inside I'm going through a change

And I'm falling, deeper
Help me please

I'm fighting the darkness within me
Can you hear my call
Feels like I'm frozen under my skin
I'm forever lost
Here in the shadows in the twilight
Life is eternal and my past is forsaken
I'm fighting the darkness

[II: The Darkness]

[Instrumental]

[III: Reprise]

I'm fighting the darkness within me
Can you hear my call
Feels like I'm frozen under my skin
I'm forever lost
Here in the shadows in the twilight
Life is eternal and my past is forsaken
I'm fighting the darkness
