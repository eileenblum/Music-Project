Too much time on my hands
I have no one to show me the rules
In this virtual land I can kill
And destroy all the fools

I need some action some kick to my life
Chasing attraction to prove what I can
So no one can stop me nor tell me to quit
Cause I do what I want and I rule my friend

Anyplace anytime
All I crave is a crime

Too much time on my hands
I have no one to show me the rules
In this virtual land I can kill
And destroy all the fools
All my power all my thrill
All I feel is joy while I aim
In the land of reality I am nobody

Got used to the levels - got used to the
Thrill
Need something that's higher - some real
Life to kill
Can't see any border - what's real and
What's not
Just give me a gun and the sound of a shot

Anyplace anytime
I will go for a crime

Too much time on my hands
I have no one to show me the rules
In this virtual land I can kill
And destroy all the fools
All my power all my thrill
All I feel is joy while I aim
In the land of reality I am nobody

Don't try to stop me
Get out of my way
Your blood and my bullets
Are making my day!!!!!

Too much time on my hands
I have no one to show me the rules
In this virtual land I can kill
And destroy all the fools
All my power all my thrill
All I feel is joy while I aim
In the land of reality I am nobody
