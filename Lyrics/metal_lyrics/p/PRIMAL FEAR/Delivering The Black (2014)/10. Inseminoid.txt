Through evolution all we seem to do is kill
We follow leaders blindly, bend to their will
The pages of history seem to teach us nothing
Are we just too afraid to think for ourselves

Live in fear
But we can't stop it
We all know
The killers are born that way

Save us and stop the insane
They're using deadly persuasion
Hunting and killing in vain
Death dependent

Save us and stop the insane
They hold the reigns of power
They love this dangerous game
Death dependent
Inseminoid

We search the boundaries of space
And dive the deepest seas
But when it comes to care, we're helpless

Some talk of noise pollution
When we play our heavy metal
Don't be judgemental it's our way of life

Live in fear
But we can't stop it
We all know
The killers are born that way

Save us and stop the insane
They're using deadly persuasion
Hunting and killing in vain
Death dependent

Save us and stop the insane
They hold the reins of power
They love this dangerous game
Death dependent
Inseminoid
