There's a sign in the sky
And the thunder is calling my name
When it comes to the point
Agony turns into pain

There's no surrender!
I know I'll never give in
I won't stop fightin'

When death comes knocking
I'll stand my ground
And I won't go down
My name stays immortal
When death comes knocking
I bend the rules
When death comes knocking

I can hide
I can run but the beast
Smells my blood in the wind
Hear the gasp
Hear it roar
This is my primal fear from within

There's no surrender!
I know I'll never give in
I won't stop fightin'

When death comes knocking
I'll stand my ground
And I won't go down
My name stays immortal
When death comes knocking
I bend the rules
When death comes knocking

When death comes knocking
I'll stand my ground
And I won't go down
My name stays immortal
When death comes knocking
I bend the rules
When death comes knocking
