In the early freeze of Monday
I'm staring at the wall
The final days of mankind
At the end of our days

Hate - can't understand
What can we do about it
Can't receive a signal in the dark
Fate - we all are trapped in Armageddon
We've overrun the risk
We've gone too far

Nobody cared about the warning
It was so clear - searching for advice
Will there be another morning
Now we will pay the bill
We'll pay the prize

Will you hold on the flame
One night in December
It's a hymn for the haunted
One night in December
The final hour strikes

Surrounded by the darkness
I'm staring to the sky
Unknown constellation
We're drifting away

Hate - can't understand
What have we done
Can't receive a signal in the dark
Fate - accept that it's too late to run
We've overrun the risk
We've gone too far

Nobody cared about the warning
It was so clear - searching for advice
Will there be another morning
Now we will pay the bill
We'll pay the prize

Will you hold on the flame
One night in December
It's a hymn for the haunted
One night in December
The final hour strikes
