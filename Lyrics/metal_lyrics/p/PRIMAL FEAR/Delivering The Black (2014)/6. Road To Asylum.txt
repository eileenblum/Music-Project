Inside the black, a fight to survive
Who's the winner?
What's meant to be will find a way for sure

Sometimes it feels like the more you care
The more you get hurt
And now it's me against the world

On my way - chasing the wind
Never break the silence
Ont he road to asylum
People change, feelings change
I've survived my darkest hour
I will ride on
On the road to asylum

I've tried to stay away
From words like ever or never
Heaven is very hard to reach

When the trust is gone
There's nothing left to fight for
And now it's me against the world

On my way - chasing the wind
Never break the silence
On the road to asylum
People change, feelings change
I've survived my darkest hour
I will ride on
On the road to asylum
