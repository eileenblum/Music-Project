The world's corruption will never change
Sitting still alive in an electric chair
History repeats, cheats and denies
No more toxic gas attacks
And no one died

Hate
And still religion
Praises holy war
My own Hell
Is running cold

In for the kill
Alive and on fire
Your own will
Alive and on fire
In for the kill
Takes me higher and higher
In for the kill
Alive and on fire

There ain't no cure
In the killing zone
The black car driving man
Is still digging for gold

No more heroes
In no mans land
We swallow
Poisoned water
Cash in hand

Hate
And still religion
Praises holy war
My own Hell
Is running cold

In for the kill
Alive and on fire
Your own will
Alive and on fire
In for the kill
Takes me higher and higher
In for the kill
Alive and on fire
