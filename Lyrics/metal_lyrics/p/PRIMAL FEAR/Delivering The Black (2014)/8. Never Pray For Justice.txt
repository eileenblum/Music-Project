We came to rock - we came to rule
There is no way to escape for you
We're heating up your nasty dreams
Never pray for justice

We're living in the darkness
Hunting in the shadows
Electrified from head to toe

We came to rock
We came to rule
We're made of fire

This world will fade away
Don't tell me there's another way
Our hell is running cold
Here and now - tonight's the night
We're waiting for the lights
Your fantasy will come alive

Breakout - let 'em shout
We are here tonight
And it's our fight
Breakout - let 'em shout
We own the night

We came to rock - we came to rule
On fuel injected speed for you
We're coming home with thunder roar
Let us hear you scream

Do you want it bad
And do you feel the magic
Wanna make it big at last

We came to rock
We came to rule
We're made of fire

This world will fade away
Don't tell me there's another way

Our hell is running cold
Here and now - tonight's the night
We're waiting for the lights
Your fantasy will come alive

Breakout - let 'em shout
We are here tonight
And it's our fight
Breakout - let 'em shout
We won the night
Breakout - let 'em shout
We are here tonight
And it's our fight
Breakout - let 'em shout
We own the night
