[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]It all happened last night
As the gang broke loose
"Jailbreak - Jailbreak!!!
As I was left back on my own

I just put up a fight as a guard has caught me
Chasing me around
In self defense my bullet caught him

This time I will prove it's not my fault
it's not what it looks like - never!!

The innocent man
Clean handed
I'm burdened with guilt
The innocent man
In crazed action
Give me back my dignity

Intangible hard luck
In the wrong place
At the wrong time
The dude was firing
With all guns
"Jailbreak - Jailbreak!!"

I tried to save my own life
In the twilight zone
State of exception
Everybody would
Have done the same thing

Take back your accuse
It's not my fault
It's not what it looks like
Never - no!!

The innocent man
Clean handed
I'm burdened with guilt
The innocent man
In crazed action
Give me back my dignity

The innocent man
Clean handed
I'm burdened with guilt
The innocent man
In crazed action
Give me back my dignity
