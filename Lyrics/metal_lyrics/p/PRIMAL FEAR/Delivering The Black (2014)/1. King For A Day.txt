Can't change the past, the future's unknown
Don't turn your back, you threw the first stone

I gave you love - I give you hate
I've granted all your wishes
I gave you hope - I gave you pain
You are the Devil

You've reached the top - you sit on your throne
You're going down and you're going alone

I gave you love - I give you hate
And when your darkness fades away
I gave you hope - I give you pain
You better run

King for a day - it's your carnal desire
King for a day - I will call you a liar

Once there was love, now there is only doubt
Feel the anger taking over my faith

I gave you love - I give you hate
I'm counting all my scars
I gave you hope - I give you pain
Your life is war

When you see your dreams engulfed in flames
You'll see just my smile - there will be no rain

I gave you love - I give you hate
and now it's me against the world
I gave you hope - I give you pain
You better run

King for a day - it's your carnal desire
King for a day - I will call you a liar
King for a day
I've been broken and beat down
King for a day
I am no longer your clown
