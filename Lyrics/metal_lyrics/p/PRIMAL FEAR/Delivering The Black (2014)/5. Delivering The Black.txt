The night was so black
As we've planned to attack
Like a bullet in the dark
A rock'n roll dream
And electric guitars hear
The Devil's dog bark

Nothing to lose
And nothing to prove
Standing here
Side by side in the rain
Traded our soul
And taking the toll
On our way to the promised land

We're run - with the Devil
We're delivering the black
We're run - the next level
Delivering the black

Our hearts full of vengeance
Fists in the air
The rock'n roll Heaven ahead
We made a deal with the Devil
For fortune and fame
And riding the dragon's head

Nothing to lose
And nothing to prove
Standing here
Side by side in the rain
Traded our soul
And taking the toll
On our way to the promised land

We're run - with the Devil
We're delivering the black
We're run - the next level
Delivering the black

Just one more dream
Like a black symphony
Fire and flames
To rock the world
Twenty years later
And nothing has changed
And there's still
A tattoo on my back

We're run - with the Devil
We're delivering the black
We're run - the next level
Delivering the black
