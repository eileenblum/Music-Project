In the final hour - the guilty pays
The ghost is still inside me
I throw this bottle at the wall

When you fight fire with fire
End up with ashes
Alone - nobody aside you
Nothing but an empty glass

Walk with me - straight through the fire
I've been torn apart
Born with a broken heart
Walk with me - through the ashes of my life
I need a brand new start
I'm born with a broken heart

Fake friends - like shadows
Are always near you
At your brightest moments
But nowhere at your darkest hours

An outlaws heart, back from trouble
I'm chasing the demons in me
And my change is gonna come

Walk with me - straight through the fire
I've been torn apart
Born with a broken heart
Walk with me - through the ashes of my life
I need a brand new start
I'm born with a broken heart

I've been locked out of Heaven
For a long long time
Fear tried to control me
No more time to say goodbye

Walk with me - straight through the fire
I've been torn apart
Born with a broken heart
Walk with me - through the ashes of my life
I need a brand new start
I'm born with a broken heart
