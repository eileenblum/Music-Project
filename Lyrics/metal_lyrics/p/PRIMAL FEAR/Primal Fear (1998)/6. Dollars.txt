I saw a cadillac driving to the wishing well
A sweet illusion or a secret from hell

I was paralyzed, kinda hypnotized
And the time stood still

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth

There's no one scared and nothing left
Was it my lucky day or am I a jerk

Your shadow's still here, do you live in fear
Is this superstition

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth

Your shadow's still here, do you live in fear
Is this superstition

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth

If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I'll be watching you
If dollars were dirt
Gold and honey
I can see the truth
See the truth
See the truth
