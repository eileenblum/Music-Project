Out of this world in another dimension
2000 lightyears from home
Defending the faith he fights for a mission
But he is standing alone

Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight

Chainbreaker
He fights for the right
Chainbreaker

Watchin' the dark he supresses the evil
Raisin' the spirit up high
Beware of the dead this place is so lethal
He's livin' a dangerous lie

Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight

Chainbreaker
He fights for the right
Chainbreaker

Devastating disillusion no solution
Everlasting resurrection with dejection
Degradation desperation lost emotion
Aggravation desolation in perfection

Just like an outlaw he's fighting for freedom
Defeating the enemy's pride
Keepin' it all under surveillance tonight

Chainbreaker
He fights for the right
