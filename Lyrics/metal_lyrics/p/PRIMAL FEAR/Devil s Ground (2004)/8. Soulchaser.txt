[Lyrics by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann]

I'm fighting through stages
And it burns me alive
A truth you will never believe
But no modern messiah will arise

Burning the place - set to burst
Coming from the pain
Thunder crash from far beyond
No one will remain

Hear me out of the dark
Come to break the spell
Come with me to the other side
Hear the final bell

Soulchaser
I'm watching over you
Soulchaser
You will see the truth

Our strike against heaven
Our war against hell
You'll wake up laughing
And I will show you the way

Protecting the dark
The underworld waits
And you're a soul in need
I'll take your pain
Come follow me
Or you will ever bleed

Don't be afraid of the dark
Please don't turn away
Come with me into my heart
Follow me, just pray

Soulchaser
I'm watching over you
Soulchaser
You will see the truth
