[Lyrics by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann]

Free choices always had the chance
To play the music you like true and faithful
You support this sound and rhythm
You back up it's future from deep in your heart

Faster beats are pounding
While the fans are shouting

Metal is forever
In every single matter
Metal is forever
Nations come together

Excited - when you go to see a show
Your feelings arise
Committed - You became a fan forever
Knowing the words you sing all the tunes

Faster beats are pounding
Glowing tubes - high sounding

Metal is forever
In every single matter
Metal is forever
Nations come together

Faster beats are pounding
Screaming voices - howling

Metal is forever
In every single matter
Metal is forever
Nations come together
