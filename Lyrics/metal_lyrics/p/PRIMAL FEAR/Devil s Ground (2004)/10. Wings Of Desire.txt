I'm walking the thin line and I realize
There is only one way to go
A one way street back to hell

Well I can't go on
Cause the truth is mine
I could only wait
My heart beat's the rhythm of time
There's only one destiny

Watch me die again, I'm losing faith
There is nobody holding the flame

Feel the touch of the wing
Feel the eagleheart
Feel the look of his eyes
It takes me higher and higher
On the wings of desire

Who's behind my eyes - who follow me
I'm fighting the pain
Running on the edge of a dream
Can I save myself

At the end of the line, the end of the dream
My soul escapes
Come listen to my silent screams
In a dead end street

Watch me die again, take the demons from me
Will you visit my final hour

Feel the touch of the wing
Feel the eagleheart
Feel the look of his eyes
It takes me higher and higher
On the wings of desire

No sign no light is leading my way
Some minutes later
I'm back and awaiting the day
There's only a chance to turn
There's only a flame that burns on the wings of desire

Watch me die again, take the demons from me
Will you visit my final hour

Feel the touch of the wing
Feel the eagleheart
Feel the look of his eyes
It takes me higher and higher
On the wings of desire
