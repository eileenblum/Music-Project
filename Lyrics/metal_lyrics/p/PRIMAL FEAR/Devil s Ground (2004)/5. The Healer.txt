In this deserted world
It's tough not to lose the heart
You once believed in miracles
Now it's a world apart

When the world is crushing down
And you're feeling down and out
When you feel there's no hope
Just follow me and you won't doubt

Alone on the hill
Lives the man they call healer
You look in his eyes
And you know that it's real
And you feel that you're stronger
You lose all your weakness
You lose all your fear
When you hear how he speaks
As you walk to the hill
To the man they call healer
Step by step you grow
And you will start to see
That it's real what they say
About him and his magic
He is small but inside him
You can see the whole world in his eyes

He lives beyond the old oak
In a cabin near the creek
Some say he's a drop out
Some say he's just a freak

I can tell without a doubt
That's not true at all
Have you seen the old and sick
Climb up to the hill
Even if they crawl

Alone on the hill
Lives the man they call healer
You look in his eyes
And you know that it's real
And you feel that you're stronger
You lose all your weakness
You lose all your fear
When you hear how he speaks
As you walk to the hill
To the man they call healer
Step by step you grow
And you will start to see
That it's real what they say
About him and his magic
He is small but a giant
You can see
The whole world in his eyes
