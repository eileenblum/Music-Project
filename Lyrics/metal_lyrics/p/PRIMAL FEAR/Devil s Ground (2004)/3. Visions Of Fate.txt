[Lyrics by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann]

What lies in you
What you fight for
It all is up to you
The vision's clear
You are the master of your fate

You break down every barrier
That is standing in your way
You are a fighter young and strong

Visions of fate
Take your luck right in your hand
And be the master of your destiny
It all lies in your hand
Visions of fate

A dream is true and real
As long as you believe
You know you goal the light
That leads you through the dark

You know your way, you have no fear
Even through it's hard
To make a fire out of a spark

Visions of fate
Take your luck right in your hand
And be the master of your destiny
It all lies in your hand
Visions of fate
