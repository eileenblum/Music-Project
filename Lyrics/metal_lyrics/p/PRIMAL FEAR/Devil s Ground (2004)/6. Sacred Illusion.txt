[Lyrics by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann, Vinter (Vinter)]

No one can take my dreams away
No one will turn my night into day
I was born individual
I'm as unique as the holy wall

My mind is as free as I want it
My property since birth

The leaders of society
Are diggin' on my sacred illusion
They won't take
That my thoughts are free
So now they want my sacred illusion

Scary - I feel like on the run
I'll die to live just at my place on my own
I feel their breath right on my neck
I just await an instant attack

My mind is as free as I want it
My property since birth

The leaders of society
Are diggin' on my sacred illusion
They won't take
That my thoughts are free
So now they want my sacred illusion

My mind is as free as I want it
My property since birth

The leaders of society
Are diggin' on my sacred illusion
They won't take
That my thoughts are free
So now they want my sacred illusion
