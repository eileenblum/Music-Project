[Lyrics by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann]

I see their faces
They're hunting me
It's like a bullet
Flying over me

Despite the time they waste on me
There's no way out, no breaking free
I chase the shadow on the wall
I am a prisoner of myself
Just look at me

No doctor - no healing
There's only disbelieving
The naked truth - no fantasy
No doctor - no healing
The poison gas I'm breathing
No other choice - than suicide and mania

Too many changes
Have ripped out my heart
Edge of insanity
I am the evil part

This must be real no fantasy
They're watching and destroying me
I'll crash my car against a wall
A silent scream, a final call
A funeral march

No doctor - no healing
There's only disbelieving
The naked truth - no fantasy
No doctor - no healing
The poison gas I'm breathing
No other choice - than suicide and mania
