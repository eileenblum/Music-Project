The longest night
All systems are ready to go
We could not prevent it
As the final threat grows
A secret origin
Danger's in our blood
I'm standing next to a church
There's no hope without a prayer

It became reality
No security - it's good or bad
To protect our property
To defend our land

In metal

Only frightened faces
On the first wave of attack
The moment of truth
And the city's turning red
Metal creatures from far away
Came to prove the evidence
Religious insanity
At the last line of defense

It became reality
No security - it's good or bad
To protect our property
To defend our land

In metal
