[Lyrics by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann]

So many years I've been away from home
On the search for myself addicted to roam
The restless heart, I'm carrying in me
Lead me to places I thought I'd never see

Love / hate - I wear it in my soul
Heart / soul - these are my highest goals
Hot / cold - honesty is at my side
Left / right - the saviour and their guide

Strong and proud I am marching my way
As long as I live I will stay
A warrior to make the world safe
I have the heart of a brave

So many years
I've been looking for truth
Trying to go straight way
Took every sin of the youth
Always held my head high
I've always been true
There is no door
I haven't walked through

Love / hate - I wear it in my soul
Heart / soul - these are my highest goals
Hot / cold - honesty is at my side
Left / right - the saviour and their guide

Strong and proud I am marching my way
As long as I live I will stay
A warrior to make the world safe
I have the heart of a brave
