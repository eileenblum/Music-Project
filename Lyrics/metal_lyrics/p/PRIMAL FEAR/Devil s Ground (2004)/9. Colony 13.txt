[Lyrics by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann]

Striking through the dust
With elemental forces
Keeping up the quest
And all will turn to wrecks

Hiding in the dark
No one ever sees me
The enemy returns
The land will turn to black

You hide in dignity
Our time is done
Gone for eternity
When all is gone

You cry, you die
It's your last resort
When all is turning black
In Colony 13
You see the sky
It's the final sign
When all is turning black
In Colony 13

Racing through the light
At cyberspeed and silver
You feel it in your bones
It's the final call

Red on the horizon
Screams out of the dirt
The final gunshot sounds
You take the final breath

You hide in dignity
Our time is done
Gone for eternity
When all is gone

You cry, you die
It's your last resort
When all is turning black
In Colony 13
You see the sky
It's the final sign
When all is turning black
In Colony 13
