In metal we trust
For metal we live
In metal we trust
Give all you can give

Watch me now
I'm made of fire
Mark my words
I'm no liar

The stage is my castle
The lights give me power
You're all invited just show me the sign
Follow the spotlight
Follow my scream
This is our battle and metal we win

In metal we trust
For metal we live
In metal we trust
Give all you can give

Raise your fist
Say after me
We will rock
No matter what

The stage is my castle
The lights give me power
You're all invited just show me the sign
Follow the spotlight
Follow my scream
This is our battle and metal we win

In metal we trust
For metal we live
In metal we trust
Give all you can give
