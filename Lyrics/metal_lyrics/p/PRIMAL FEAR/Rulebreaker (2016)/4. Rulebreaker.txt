I have a thousand voices in my head
They're calling ma again and again
And when the lights go down
I'm all alone
It's just so silent
Hear the rattlesnakes call

Chasing storms
Where the cold wind blows
To save my restless soul
I'm on my way to the other side

He's a rulebreaker
Hell on wheels
And it's not my last goodbye
Rulebreaker
Hell on wheels
And there's no one left to hide
He's a rulebreaker
Born a rebel and born to die alone
Rulebreaker
Hell on wheels
Into the great unknown

I'm a broken rebel
On a neverending highway
Waiting for a falling star
I had a dream
But now I'm believing
The story I tell
Leaves another scar

Chasing storms
Where the cold wind blows
To save my restless soul
I'm on my way to the other side

He's a rulebreaker
Hell on wheels
And it's not my last goodbye
Rulebreaker
Hell on wheels
And there's no one left to hide
He's a rulebreaker
Born a rebel and born to die alone
Rulebreaker
Hell on wheels
Into the great unknown
