I sold my soul for eternity
On the wrong side of heaven
Hell is not to blame
For god's forgotten son

Ten thousand miles away from home
On the dark side of hell
Turning cold for the final time
No surrender

I am alive
Through the fields of fire
Will you remember me
I an alive
Defy the undead
The sky is burning

Forgive me for my sins
On the wrong side of heaven
All my shattered dreams
Call out the demons in me

Another nightmare came true
On the dark side of hell
Release me from my pain
There's no light at the end

I am alive
Through the fields of fire
Will you remember me
I an alive
Defy the undead
The sky is burning
