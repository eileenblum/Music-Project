Are you awake - are you alive
Are you ready for a fight
Gonna raise some hell tonight

Rise up and shout
To be sacrificed
All is lost and daylight ends
Annihilation comes alive

Listen to the battle drum
Calling out your soul
When you hear the silence break
We're gonna take control

Angels of mercy
Devastation all around
Angels of mercy
Survive the killing ground

Hear the time bomb ticking
The terror of a gun
Asylum of the enemies
The monster we've become

We're made of scars
We are your pain
Forsakin in this god damn world
The one you love to hate

Listen to the battle drum
Calling out your soul
When you hear the silence break
We're gonna take control

Angels of mercy
Devastation all around
Angels of mercy
Survive the killing ground

Hear the time bomb ticking
The terror of a gun
Asylum of the enemies
The monster we've become
