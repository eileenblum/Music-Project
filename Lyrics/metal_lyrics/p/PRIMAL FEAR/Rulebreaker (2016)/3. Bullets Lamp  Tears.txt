I was down, I was up
Broken and unbound
What went up came down
And hit me hard to the ground
When all the dreams are said and done
And all the hope is gone
I woke up from these endless dreams
And justice will be done

Hey, look out!
There's nothing in-between us
Stop right now
Come on and fly away
Thunder roars, lightning strikes
You will get your bullets and tears
Thunder roars and I'm on my way to you

I was down, I was up
Alone and beaten to the ground
What went up, came down
From the flames and ashes

Hey, look out!
There's nothing in-between us
Stop right now
Come on and fly away

Thunder roars, lightning strikes
You will get your bullets and tears
Thunder roars and I'm on my way to you
Thunder roars, lightning strikes
You will get your bullets and tears
Thunder roars and I'm on my way to you
