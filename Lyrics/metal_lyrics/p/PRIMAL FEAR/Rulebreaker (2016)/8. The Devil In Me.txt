On my way to reach heaven
In the darkest night
When an angel is headinh to hell

Some call in hit and run
Some others hold a gun
Hear the sound of the bell

Someday the curse will be done
Now is the time
That we're waiting for so long

Hang tough - stay wild
There's no return
The devil in me

Hang tough
On the wing of an eagle
There's no return
The devil in me

The full moon is rising
The raven dies
It is time to start our story

The eyes of a cat
The cry of a witch
A night made with glory

Someday the curse will be done
Now is the time
That we're waiting for so long

Hang tough - stay wild
There's no return
The devil in me
Hang tough
On the wing of an eagle
There's no return
The devil in me
