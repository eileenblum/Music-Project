There is something deep inside me
That keeps my faith alive tonight
You're gonna burn, there's no return
A fight to survive

There is no superman hero
There is no place where I can hide
It comes alive
The monster in me
In my body, in my head

I see you die
These demons are killing me
Right here - right now
It comes alive

I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
No time to remember
I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
I'm just the defender

I see faces full of anger
I never took the easy way
I'm gonna burn, there's no return
On my crusade hope

I see you die
These demons are killing me
Right here - right now
It comes alive

I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
No time to remember
I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
I'm just the defender
At war with the world
