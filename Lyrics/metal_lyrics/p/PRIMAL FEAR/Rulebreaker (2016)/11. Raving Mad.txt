Another nightmare is coming true
Taking possession out of the blue
There's a cyclone in my head

It's never ending - keeps coming back
Just can't control this monster
I'm under attack

Raving mad
Two souls alas are dwelling in my breast
Raving mad
I'm such a mess - to fail this acid test

Can't sort the pictures all blurred and skewed
Dystopian vision I'm simply screwed
Schizophrenic - addled brain

Just call the nut house to pick me up
It's tool late to call the doctor
I'm just a dead loss

Raving mad
Two souls alas are dwelling in my breast
Raving mad
I'm such a mess - to fail this acid test

Raving mad
Two souls alas are dwelling in my breast
Raving mad
Raving mad
Raving mad
Raving mad
