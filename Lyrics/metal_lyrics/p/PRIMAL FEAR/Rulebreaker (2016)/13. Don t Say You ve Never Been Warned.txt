[Bonus Track]YouÂ´ve got the taste of hell
You felt the sense of power
And now youÂ´re coming back for more
You know thereÂ´s no return
And you would rather burn
Choose the life youÂ´ve lived before

I will break out better watch out
Look into the flames thereÂ´s no doubt
You will blackout when I rise

ThereÂ´s a way to live thereÂ´s a way to die
Watch me fear me I can make you fly
ThereÂ´s a way to win and a way to lose
Listen closely I bury you alive
DonÂ´t say youÂ´ve never been warned

You got the taste of blood
You just canÂ´t get enough
And now itÂ´s time to call the beast
You canÂ´t control your lust
Crawling through the dust
Now youÂ´re out and you are free

I will break out better watch out
Look into the flames thereÂ´s no doubt
You will blackout when I rise

ThereÂ´s a way to live thereÂ´s a way to die
Watch me fear me I can make you fly
ThereÂ´s a way to win and a way to lose
Listen closely I bury you alive
DonÂ´t say youÂ´ve never been warned

I will break out better watch out
Look into the flames thereÂ´s no doubt
You will blackout when I rise

ThereÂ´s a way to live thereÂ´s a way to die
Watch me fear me I can make you fly
ThereÂ´s a way to win and a way to lose
Listen closely I bury you alive
ThereÂ´s a way to live thereÂ´s a way to die
Watch me fear me I can make you fly
ThereÂ´s a way to win and a way to lose
Listen closely I bury you alive
DonÂ´t say youÂ´ve never been warned
