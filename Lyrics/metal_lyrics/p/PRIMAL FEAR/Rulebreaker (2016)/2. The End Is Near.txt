The battle is on
When the lightning strikes
The full moon's rising in the middle of a night

Hear my warning
See their fear
Hear my warning

Do you wanna die
The end is near
We better pull together
We don't try to live forever
The end is near
We better pull together
We don't try to live forever
The end is near

As the sun comes up
It's all said and done
Armageddon is near
But the war is won

Hear my warning
See their fear
Hear my warning

Do you wanna die
The end is near
We better pull together
We don't try to live forever
The end is near
We better pull together
We don't try to live forever
The end is near

No one escaped
From the battlezone
No more questions
Who is right or wrong

Hear my warning
See their fear
Hear my warning

Do you wanna die
The end is near
We better pull together
We don't try to live forever
The end is near
We better pull together
We don't try to live forever
The end is near
The end is near
The end is near
