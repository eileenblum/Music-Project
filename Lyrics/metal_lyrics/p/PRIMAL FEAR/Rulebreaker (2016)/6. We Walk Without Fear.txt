The ocean's calm and blue
Just waiting for a storm
One more look into your eyes
I'm baptized by fire
Don't believe what I hear
And I'm still alive

Sometimes two worlds collide
No more storyteller lies
I'm not waiting
I'm not waiting for my fall
Chasing shadows on the wall

I'm trapped in your silence
My heart's gonna drown
Once there was a secret
But I never let you down
I saw ten millions faces
So many ways to fear
I'm standing beside you
We walk without fear

I've sailed the seven seas
Was fighting all my fears
But now I'm heading home
The world's going down in flames
It's hard to explain
All the mistakes I have done

Sometimes two worlds collide
No more storyteller lies
I'm not waiting
I'm not waiting for my fall
Chasing shadows on the wall

I'm trapped in your silence
My heart's gonna drown
Once there was a secret
But I never let you down
I saw ten millions faces
So many ways to fear
I'm standing beside you
We walk without fear
