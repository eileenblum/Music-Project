WE'RE HEADING OUT TO NOWHERE,
CRUSIN' ON TOTAL SPEED
THE ONLY CHANCE WAS
TO EXTERMINATE THE BREED
UP TO THE MINUTE,
WE CAN LOSE THIS FIGHT
EVERY DAY ANOTHER MISSION
ON OUR ENDLESS FLIGHT

THE DREAMS BECAME LESS
THE NIGHT HAD US UNDER ITS SPELL
WE LOOKED INTO OUR EYES
IT WAS A COLD DAY IN HELL

ALL OR NOTHING
TILL THE LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
ALL OR NOTHING
IT WAS A COLD DAY IN HELL

ON THE HORIZON WE SAW SMOKE
COMING OUT OF THE BLUE
WE SAW THE NEXT LEVEL
IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE

STRANGE COLOURS SURROUNDED US
ON OUR MISSION WITHOUT HOPE
BUT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
WE'RE WALKING THE THIN ROPE

ALL OR NOTHING
TILL THE LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
ALL OR NOTHING
IT WAS A COLD DAY IN HELL
