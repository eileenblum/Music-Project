WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BRING
MANKIND DOESN'T KNOW
THE FATE DECIDES YOUR DESTINY
LIKE A CLAW OUT OF THE DARK

IF CLOUDS WILL MAKE THE DAY TO NIGHT
OR THE SUN LIGHTS UP YOUR DAY
WILL YOU BE A LUCKY MAN
OR WILL YOU LIVE IN TRAGEDY

THAT DOESN'T TOUCH ME
I'M ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
I HAVE THE POWER
I HOLD THE KEY IN MY HAND

I SEE THE TRUTH BEHIND THE LIE
BECAUSE I OWN THE MAGIC EYE
THE ENDLESS WISDOM WILL NEVER DIE
I'VE GOT THE POWER THE MAGIC EYE

ENVY AND DECEPTION AS LONG
AS MEN LIVE ON THIS EARTH
THE LEADERS OF THE NATIONS
WHAT IS THEIR FINAL AIM

CAN YOU RECOGNIZE
WHAT'S TRUTH AND WHAT IS LIE
CAN YOU DISTINGUISH
WHO'S FRIEND, WHO'S ENEMY

THAT DOESN'T TOUCH ME
I'M ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
I HAVE THE POWER
I HOLD THE KEY IN MY HAND

I SEE THE TRUTH BEHIND THE LIE
BECAUSE I OWN THE MAGIC EYE
THE ENDLESS WISDOM WILL NEVER DIE
I'VE GOT THE POWER THE MAGIC EYE
