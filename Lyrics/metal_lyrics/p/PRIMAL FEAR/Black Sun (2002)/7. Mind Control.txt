CRASH INTO THE UNIVERSE
ALL ON HOLD, FAR INTO THE NIGHT
WE START TO BREAK IN CYBERSPACE
ALL ON BOARD, NO PLACE TO HIDE

A MISSION TO NOWHERE
A PLACE BEYOND BELIEF
WE SEE THE SUNRISE
FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE

THERE WERE MANY YEARS TO COME
SO MANY HEADS WILL ROLL
THE FINAL CURTAIN FALLS
IT'S MIND CONTROL

UNRELATED BORDERS,
DEATH COMES CLOSE
BEFORE WE REALIZED
THERE WERE NO MORE WARNINGS
LIGHTNING FLASHING
WITHOUT COMPROMISE

A MISSION TO NOWHERE
A PLACE BEYOND BELIEF
HEROES DIE YOUNG,
BUT WE'RE ALIVE

THERE WERE MANY YEARS TO COME
SO MANY HEADS WILL ROLL
THE FINAL CURTAIN FALLS
IT'S MIND CONTROL

FIGHTING ONLY FOR ONE REASON
THE ADVENTURE IN OUR EYES
I WANT TO BELIEVE
IT'S MIND CONTROL
