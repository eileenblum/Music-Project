IT'S OUR GIFT - A CURSE,
OUR BLOOD COLOURED IN BLACK
NOBODY KNOWS - NOBODY CARES,
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK

EVERY MAN BEFORE HE DIES
SHALL SEE THE DEVIL
OUR LIFE WAS FAR FROM SAFE

WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE,
WE FEEL WHAT THEY FEEL
WHERE EVER WE MAY ROAM
WE LIVE IN FEAR AND
WE ARE LIGHTYEARS FROM HOME

FIVE SOULS WAITING FOR A SIGN
...IN SILENCE
OH LORD SAVE OUR TROUBLED SOULS, COVER THE DARKNESS

EVERY MAN BEFORE HE DIES
SHALL SEE THE DEVIL
OUR LIFE WAS FAR FROM SAFE

WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE,
WE FEEL WHAT THEY FEEL
WHERE EVER WE MAY ROAM
WE LIVE IN FEAR AND
WE ARE LIGHTYEARS FROM HOME

WE HAD THIS DREAM, WE FEAR MOST,
BUT WOULD YOU CAPTURE ME STILL
THERE'S OUR CHANCE TO ESCAPE,
OUR MISSION COULD BE FULLFILLED

EVERY MAN BEFORE HE DIES
SHALL SEE THE DEVIL
OUR LIFE WAS FAR FROM SAFE

WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE,
WE FEEL WHAT THEY FEEL
WHERE EVER WE MAY ROAM
WE LIVE IN FEAR AND
WE ARE LIGHTYEARS FROM HOME
