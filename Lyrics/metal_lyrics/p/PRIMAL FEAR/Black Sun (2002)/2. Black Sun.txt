THERE'RE SO MANY LIGHTYEARS TO COME
THERE'RE SO MANY LIGHTYEARS BEHIND US
THERE'RE SO MANY THINGS WE HAVE DONE
AND SO MANY SUNS WHICH HAVE BLINDED US

WE'RE SHINING IN LIGHTNING
LOOK TO THE SKY AND YOU'LL SEE US
SENSATION - DAMNATION
WE'RE HUNGRY AND WE'RE CURIOUS

METAL EAGLES - FLYING SIDE BY SIDE
SILVER HEROES - HEAR OUR CRIES

ON A MISSION - TO ANOTHER WORLD
ON A MISSION - WE'RE RIDING
ON A MISSION - OUR SPELL IS DONE
ON A MISSION - TO THE BLACK SUN

IN SEARCH FOR THE LIGHT OF OUR LIVES
IN SEARCH FOR THE LIGHT OF OUR FREEDOM
TO RESCUE THE ENTIRE MANKIND
TO KEEP ALL OUR HOPE WE BELIEVE IN

METAL EAGLES - FLYING SIDE BY SIDE
SILVER HEROES - HEAR OUR CRIES

ON A MISSION - TO ANOTHER WORLD
ON A MISSION - WE'RE RIDING
ON A MISSION - OUR SPELL IS DONE
ON A MISSION - TO THE BLACK SUN
