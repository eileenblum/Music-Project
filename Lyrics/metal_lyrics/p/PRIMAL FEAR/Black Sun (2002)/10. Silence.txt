SO COLD IS THE NIGHT
IT'S SILENT WITHOUT LIGHT
SINCE DAYS THEY PROMISED US
TO BE HOME AGAIN

THE DEATH COMES CLOSER
HE FEAR'S COMING NEARER TO US
THERE WILL BE NO TOMORROW,
DO WE GO INSANE

I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU WITH ME

WILL THERE EVER BE AN END
WILL THERE EVER BE A LAST GOODBYE
PLEASE TELL ME THERE IS HOPE
IN SILENCE TILL WE DIE

THERE IS STILL LONGING
IN MY EYES I SEE A DIFFERENT EARTH
I'M NOT IMPRESSED, IT'S JUST THE SILENCE

THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN

WILL THERE EVER BE AN END
WILL THERE EVER BE A LAST GOODBYE
PLEASE TELL ME THERE IS HOPE
IN SILENCE TILL WE DIE

WAITINGIT'S LATELY
AND THERE WILL BE A FIGHT
ESCAPE TO A NEW WORLD
WHAT WILL BE BEHIND THESE LIES

WILL THERE EVER BE AN END
WILL THERE EVER BE A LAST GOODBYE
PLEASE TELL ME THERE IS HOPE
IN SILENCE TILL WE DIE
