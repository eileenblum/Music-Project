GOTTA KILL THE DEMON
THAT BRINGS EVIL TO MY WORLD
WILL ERASE THE BAD THINGS
AND THE MEMORIES
THAT KEEP HAUNTING IN MY MIND

I WILL RAISE THE FEVER,
DRIVE YOU CRAZY TILL IT HURTS
GONNA BRING YOU NIGHTMARES TURN YOUR DAY
INTO THE DARKEST OF ALL NIGHTS

BAD OR GOOD
I'M UNDER SURVEILLANCE
BAD OR GOOD

I RULE THE SHOW, WON'T LET YOU GO
I'M YOUR MIND MACHINE
I TAKE CONTROL, AFFECT YOUR SOUL
I'M YOUR MIND MACHINE

I'M STILL BELIEVING
THAT MY FEELINGS BRING YOU DOWN
YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE GOOD
AND POSITIVE EMOTIONS FROM MY HEART

I WILL MAKE YOU SHIVER
WHEN YOU HEAR A KILLING SOUND
I WILL CONVINCE YOU SO YOU'LL SEE
I WAS YOUR MASTER FROM THE START

BAD OR GOOD
I'M UNDER SURVEILLANCE
BAD OR GOOD

I RULE THE SHOW, WON'T LET YOU GO
I'M YOUR MIND MACHINE
I TAKE CONTROL, AFFECT YOUR SOUL
I'M YOUR MIND MACHINE
