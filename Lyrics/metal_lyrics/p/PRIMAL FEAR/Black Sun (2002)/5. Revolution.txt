RIDING THE ELECTRIC STORM
I AM A WIDOWMAKER
TAKING MY REVENGE, I'M A SOULBREAKER
HOWLING THROUGH THE SPACE
MY HEART'S ON FIRE
THE LUST TO KILL'EM ALL IS RISING HIGHER

I'LL TAKE MY RIGHT HAND - LET'EM GO
I'LL TAKE MY LEFT HAND - LET'EM GO
I'LL TAKE'EM BOTH - RIP OFF THEIR HEADS

FEEL THE PRIDE IN THIS GAME
ON MY JOURNEY THROUGH
THE LAND OF FLAMES
MY UNHOLY REVOLUTION

SOMETHING IN MY BLOOD
IS STRONG AND KEEPS ME GOING ON
I NEVER WILL FORGET
WHERE I HAVE COME FROM

I'LL STAND FOREVER - ON AND ON
I'LL FIGHT FOREVER - ON AND ON
MY SPIRIT'S ALIVE WHEN I AM DEAD

FEEL THE PRIDE IN THIS GAME
ON MY JOURNEY THROUGH
THE LAND OF FLAMES
MY UNHOLY REVOLUTION

NEVER LOSIN', THIS JOURNEY NEVER ENDS
FOREVER CRUISIN; BESIDES MY METAL FRIENDS

FEEL THE PRIDE IN THIS GAME
ON MY JOURNEY THROUGH
THE LAND OF FLAMES
MY UNHOLY REVOLUTION
