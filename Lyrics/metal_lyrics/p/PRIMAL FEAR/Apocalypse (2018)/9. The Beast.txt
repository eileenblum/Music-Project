Iâm back into life
Back form the dead
And now thereâs no return
You watch me bleed
You watch me die
Since seven years Iâm burning

Iâve heard your prayers
From the other side
Someone was calling out my name

You woke up the beast
The beast
And now youâll pay the price
You woke up the beast
The beast
Iâm back from paradise

An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
But now my Exodus turns
You let me die
You walked away
And now itâs my return
