After the thunder
And after the rain
An ocean of tears
Revelation remains
I can't believe this is the end?

The earth is quaking
No more prayers
Sirens, alarms
Sulphur's in the air
Electric whirls and pungent smells

The atmosphere turns red
A storm is raging dark inside the land
Through the fires in the night
The sun is turning black

The world is cursed
Angels will fall
A thousand tears, a thousand more
Shadows are moving, stars collide

The atmosphere turns red
A storm is raging dark inside the land
Through the fires in the night
The sun is turning black

Sins can't be washed away
The world is going down on Judgement Day
No more heaven and hell
The moon is turning red

The atmosphere turns red
A storm is raging dark inside the land
Through the fires in the night
The sun is turning black

The atmosphere turns red
A storm is raging dark inside the land
Through the fires in the night
The sun is turning black

Sins can't be washed away
The world is going down on Judgement Day
No more heaven and hell
(On a supernova)
The moon is turning red
