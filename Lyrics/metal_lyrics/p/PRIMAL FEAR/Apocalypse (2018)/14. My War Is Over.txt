In the morning I'll be gone
Leaving everything
The house love has built
Better take away the pain
Up where the sky belongs to me

With a smile on my face
I don't lose this game

You need me - I hear you
I know - My war is over

In loneliness I'm drowning
Silent screams around me
I know - My war is over now

Nothing left for me to miss
I've waited far too long
Out in the cold

We held each other close

You need me - I hear you
I know - My war is over

In loneliness I'm drowning
Silent screams around me
I know - My war is over now
