Iâm a believer and I just do what I do
No one can stop me my darling not even you

Iâm wasting time, thatâs what you tell me
But Iâm just fine, I wonât be easy on you
My heart bleeds for you

Blood - sweat and fear
Setbacks are making me stronger
Blood - sweat and fear
Iâm alive and I will never give in

I have a vision and I will follow my dreams
No superstition will ever take it away

I went school - the school of hard knocks
Iâve learned the rules and will use them on you
My heart beats for you

Blood - sweat and fear
Setbacks are making me stronger
Blood - sweat and fear
Iâm alive and I will never give in
Iâll never give in

Life is a onetime offer
Use it well
Be the change you want
To see the world

Blood - sweat and fear
Setbacks are making me stronger
Blood - sweat and fear
Iâm alive and I will never give in
Iâll never give in
And I will never give in
Iâll never give in
