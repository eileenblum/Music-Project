One more prayer for the dying
And a prayer for the dead
Can you feel the blood flow
From the fallen angel

I've travelled the world
Survived the strangest places
Another dÃ©jÃ  vu
The search for the truth
Faced fatal embraces

Heads or tails
Do or die
Kill your demons
To turn the scales

It's unpredictable
It's never visual
Always spiritual
It's the ritual

It is untouchable
It's indestructible
It's invincible
It's the ritual

You can't kill the holy silence
On a journey to asylum
Sentence to inhale
The smoke and fear

Listen to the ghostly cry
When death is shining
The defender of the darkest fear

Heads or tails
Do or die
Kill your demons
To turn the scales

It's unpredictable
It's never visual
Always spiritual
It's the ritual

It is untouchable
It's indestructible
It's invincible
It's the ritual

Heads or tails
Do or die
Kill your demons
To turn the scales

It's unpredictable
It's never visual
Always spiritual
It's the ritual

It is untouchable
It's indestructible
It's invincible
It's the ritual

It's unpredictable
It's never visual
Always spiritual
It's the ritual
