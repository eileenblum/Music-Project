I hear them spreading all these rumors
And everyone adds a bit more
Their lives are boring just bleak and dull
Can everyone just shut the fuck up?

Yes, I'm a sinner but they are too
In adding lies they're not better than me
But I was lucky cause I met you
Right now and altogether we will go
Through thick and thin

Into the fire
Into the fire
Walking through the fire

They need sensation that's what we'll do
Bring on the night that's when we're alive
Run of the mill is all they know
They'll see together we dance into the
Brightest light

Into the fire
Into the fire
Walking through the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
We are so much higher

Into the fire
Into the fire
Walking through the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
We are so much higher
Into the fire
Into the fire
Walking through the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
We are so much higher
