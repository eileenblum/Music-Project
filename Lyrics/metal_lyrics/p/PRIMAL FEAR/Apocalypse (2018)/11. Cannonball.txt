Iâve tried to climb the mountains
Sailed the seven seas
Getting closer to the sun
Itâs too late for my own mistakes

Blindness forever reigns
From the yesterdayâs mind
Every logic has disappeared
Thereâs no call from the human side

When the sky is falling down
And the new dayâs dawning
And the clouds are storming by
We can see thereâs nothing left
To fight

Shoot, shoot like a cannonball
Shoot, shoot the war is over
Shoot, shoot like a cannonball

Thereâs a way back to sanity
When death comes closer
Brothers will fight &amp; die
Nobody knows the reason why

Where insanity reigns
There will be no winners
Until the rotten core
You see the face of the sinners

When the sky is falling down
And the new dayâs dawning
And the clouds are storming by
We can see thereâs nothing left
To fight

Shoot, shoot like a cannonball
Shoot, shoot the war is over
Shoot, shoot like a cannonball
