I tried to run,
But I couldnât move
I was falling,
And crashing to the ground
Somehow I knew my wings were stolen
Though I was ready to be drowned

There is no escape,
Good weâll bury this hate
Breakinâ down the walls weâve built

Into the eye of the storm
Give me your hand, walk with me
Until the end of time
Into the eye of the storm
When the feelings go their own way
Into the eye
The eye of the storm

Now Iâm here
At the heavenâs door
Waiting that the world
Is falling down
Never thought Iâm ending here
Just surviving the Armageddon
All around me

As the sun goes down
All the prayers are done
I feel the gravity

Into the eye of the storm
Give me your hand, walk with me
Until the end of time
Into the eye of the storm
When the feelings go their own way
Into the eye
The eye of the storm
