As I write I try to remember
How it all started years ago
Restless nights blazing with anger
Day by day and show by show

How it just comes there's ups
And downs and changes
There's defeat and victory
In the end it only knits together
Faith and trust as it should be

New rise â New rise
Bad fortune has been overcome
We rised â Survived
It's time to start another run

Time went by we're facing our prime times
Higher goals and higher class
Don't justify â set signs in the spotlight
Mental flows â cohesion en masse

Through thick and thin
Destroying all obstacles
All for one and one for all
In the end it only knits together
Faith and trust as it should be

New rise â New rise
Bad fortune has been overcome
We rised â Survived
It's time to start another run

We stand together
We rock forever
Stand and deliver
All around the world
We won't surrender
We rock forever
Stand and deliver
All around the world

Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey

New rise â New rise
Bad fortune has been overcome
We rised â Survived
It's time to start another run
