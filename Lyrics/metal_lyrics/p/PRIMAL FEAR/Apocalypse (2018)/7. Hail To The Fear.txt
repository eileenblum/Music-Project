Here comes the evil
Back from the devilâs core
You nightmareâs delivered
I will crush like a wrecking ball

I will watch the nations bleed
From far above
I will sing the song of death
When all comes down
Hoist the flag of pain and fear
The poison is in my veins
You canât break me
The devil swears heâs not to blame me

Dance with the devil
Iâm dancing on a holy grave
Coming back from the dead
I will take your generationâs head

Hate, greed, destruction
Thereâs nothing left to fear
Lies, death and corruption
And Iâm taking you with me
