Bow down
Praise the crown.
Listen up,
The ruler is mad.

March on,
Your pride is gone.
Fight his war,
It's time to get bad

Killing in the name of craziness,
Fighting the war of fools.

The king of madness,
Creator of lies.
The king of sadness,
Will let this whole world die.

A battlefield filled with fools,
Thousand hearts lost in the dark.
Those who win are just tools,
A way for him to let the crazy rule.

Killing in the name of craziness,
Fighting the war of fools.

The king of madness,
Creator of lies.
The king of sadness,
Will let this whole world die.

(The king of madness)
(The king of madness)

The king of madness,
Creator of lies.
The king of sadness,
Will let this whole world die.

The king of madness,
Creator of lies.
The king of sadness,
Will let this whole world die.

(The king of madness)
