Since you've been born
Your life has not been easy on you
A screwed up childhood
Buzzed off from the school

Your parents have separated
You were caught right in between
It's time to stand up
Make your own way

Stand up!
And find the best way for you
Get up! Never give in

Never give up!
Fight against all evil
Show me what you've got!
Be a firm believer

You struggle along
To meet the standards society sets
Self-perpetuating
Working nine to five

Keep asking yourself my brother
Is that all you're looking for
It's time to stand up
Before you get old

Stand up!
And find the best way for you
Get up! Never give in

Never give up!
Fight against all evil
Show me what you've got!
Be a firm believer
