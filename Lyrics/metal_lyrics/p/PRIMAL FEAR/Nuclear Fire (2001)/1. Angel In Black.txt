Feeling the anger inside me
I'm chosen to loose in this game
To get me will not be so easy
To kill me not even the same

I'll send the fight - my pride is victory

There is blood there is pain
But my agony is not in vain
Cause there's life after death
And I'm sure coming back to attack
As an angel in black

Hiding myself in the city
So dark cause it's ruled by the ghosts
Footsteps of iron behind me
The sword of the king - I fear most

Back in the light - I face my destiny

There is blood there is pain
But my agony is not in vain
Cause there's life after death
And I'm sure coming back to attack
As an angel in black
