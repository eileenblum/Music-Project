I've seen the lightning
Can't wait for the thunder to roar
This is my battle
For honor and glory will soar

Afraid of my name
They shatter with pain
The army of horror
Is getting them all

Strike - and take no prisoners
Strike - holier than thou
Strike - without exception
Strike - holier than thou

With hate ahd anger
We're standing to counter revenge
There is no mercy
Consistently in every sense

Opponents beware
There's nothing to share
Afraid of my name
You'll shatter with pain

Strike - and take no prisoners
Strike - holier than thou
Strike - without exception
Strike - holier than thou

Invasion rolls
We're taking all over
With heart and soul
We'll stand our man

Strike - and take no prisoners
Strike - holier than thou
Strike - without exception
Strike - holier than thou
