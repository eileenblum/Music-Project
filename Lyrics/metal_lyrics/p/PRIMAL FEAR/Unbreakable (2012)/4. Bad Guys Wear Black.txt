The sound of distant thuhder
World's crushing down
And we're back again

See the dark skies coming close
The stream of light - we've just begun

Can you feel the silence rise
Just one second

Bang your head
Until you reach the end
Bang your head
And don't look back

Bang your head
And never turn it down
Bang your head
Bad guys wear black

Feel the rhythm pounding
There's no escape inside the game
Hear them screaming out for more
And the shootout's coming close

There's a message in my blood
It just says rock

Bang your head
Until you reach the end
Bang your head
And don't look back

Bang your head
And never turn it down
Bang your head
Bad guys wear black
