I call it revelation
A heart made of steel
The god of immortality
The devil made a deal

Gliding on wings
Through the dark night
Look into the faces of fear

Blaze of glory
The world is my destiny

I've watched the world's collide
As history repeats
I've killed all the demons in me
As an angel just grabbed me

Gliding on wings
Through the dark night
Look into the faces of fear

Blaze of glory
The world is my destiny
Blaze of glory
The last survivor of history
