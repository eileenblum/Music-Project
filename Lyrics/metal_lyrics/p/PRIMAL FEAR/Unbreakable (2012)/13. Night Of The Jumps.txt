[Digipak Bonus Track]Do you feel the passion
And celebrate the night of the jumps jumps
Do you feel the passion
Ride the sky flying high night of the jumps jump

CominÂ´ out of nowhere the smell of gasoline uh
AdrenalineÂ´s risinÂ´ and you are ready to win
YouÂ´re gonna hear the crowd screaminÂ´ out your name
Ooh push it to the limit and let the battle begin

Higher and higher let me take you over the top

Do you feel the passion
And celebrate the night of the jumps jumps
Do you feel the passion
Ride the sky flying high night of the jumps jump

ItÂ´s only one more minute before itÂ´s getting loud
ItÂ´s only one more minute you hear my roaring sound

Higher and higher let me take you over the top

Do you feel the passion
And celebrate the night of the jumps jumps
Do you feel the passion
Ride the sky flying high night of the jumps

Nowhere you can hold me down
I feel my pressure right on the crowd
Spitting fire and snake skin flames
Are you ready to jump with me

Do you feel the passion
And celebrate the night of the jumps
Do you feel the passion
Ride the sky cominÂ´ out of nowhere
Do you feel the passion
Do you feel the passion
And celebrate the night of the jumps
WeÂ´re gonna celebrate
Do you feel the passion
Do you feel the passion
Ride the sky flying high night of the jumps
Do you feel the passion
Do you feel the passion
And celebrate the night of the jumps
Do you feel the passion
Do you feel the passion
Ride the sky flying high night of the jumps
Do you feel the passion
Do you feel the passion
And celebrate the night of the jumps
Do you feel the passion
Do you feel the passion
Ride the sky flying high night of the jumps
