There were no simple warnings
There was no sign delared
I was just sitting there
Relaxing and watching tv

Last night things happened what everybody fears
Screams of all nations and nobody hears

All alone in the dark
There's just fear in my heart
Nothing's left
And there was silence

All alone in the dark
There's just fear in my heart
All is gone
And there was silence

I heard some roaring noises
It's time now to leave this town
As right infront of me
Explosions was shaking the place

Last night things happened what everybody fears
Screams of all nations and nobody hears

All alone in the dark
There's just fear in my heart
Nothing's left
And there was silence

All alone in the dark
There's just fear in my heart
All is gone
And there was silence
