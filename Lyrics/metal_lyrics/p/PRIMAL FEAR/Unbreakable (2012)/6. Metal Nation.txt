In a world where greed and money rule
There's no space for people who are true

We conquer the night - freedom in sight
Take all our guts and struggle on
Until we are near to the sun

Everybody join the metal nation
Adapt to the beat of our hearts
Let the music spread the word

In a time where power forces you
Not to do what you would love to do

We conquer the night - freedom in sight
Take a11 our guts and struggle on
Until we are near to the sun

Everybody join the metal nation
Adapt to the beat of our hearts
Let the music spread the word
Everybody joins a great sensation
Lets make a brand new start
Let the joy forever last

Everybody join the metal nation
Adapt to the beat of our hearts
Let the music spread the word
Everybody joins a great sensation
Lets make a brand new start
Let the joy forever last
