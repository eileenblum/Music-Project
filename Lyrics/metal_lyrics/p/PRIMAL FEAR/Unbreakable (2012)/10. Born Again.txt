So many questions - remain unanswered
So many tears - forever last
But now the biggest pain came over me again
Death is a part of life but still we ask

Is there a god
Will be born again
Can I take you in my arms again
I'm drowning in sorrow
Will you still know me
When we are born again
Will I ever see your smile again
Will we ever say good morrow

Infatuation - that's what they say we shared
Don't ever take for granted that we meet tomorrow
And all the plans we had - crisscrossed by destiny
Don't ask for equity just ask yourself again

Is there a god
Will be born again
Can I take you in my arms again
I'm drowning in sorrow
Will you still know me
When we are born again
Will I ever see your smile again
Will we ever say good morrow

I stopped for a moment
And thought what life is all about
A blink of an eye and then I asked myself again

Is there a god
Will be born again
Can I take you in my arms again
I'm drowning in sorrow
Will you still know me
When we are born again
Will I ever see your smile again
Will we ever say good morrow
