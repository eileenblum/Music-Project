Gimme more
Right down on the floor
Time stoods still
In the darkness

No time to take
No chance to hestitate
Do or die
It's all about your lies

Back from hell far off the horizon
Light it up and burn it down

Give em hell - I'll make the call
Hell and thunder roars

You're on your knees - beaten and broken
Break these walls
When world powers fall

Clashing steel - and the flag of war
The march of the death
Where it all ends

Back from hell far off the horizon
Light it up and burn it down

Give em hell - I'll make the call
Hell and thunder roars
Give em hell - part of the masterplan
Hell and thunder roars
