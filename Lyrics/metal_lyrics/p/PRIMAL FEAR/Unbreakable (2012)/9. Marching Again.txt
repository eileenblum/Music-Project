On a flight through the night
There's no sleep at midnight hour
But I'm eased - heading east
And I can not wait to hit the stage

That's what I'm born for
And that's where I live
It's where I belong

The favoured few are marching again
Destined for spreading the word
Time's on our side and the worlds' greatest fans
Are feeding the flame of our hearts

Another flight through the night
And no sleep at midnight hour
Had a blast in the west
But the time has come to fly back home

That's what I'm born for
And that's where I live
It's where I belong

The favoured few are marching again
Destined for spreading the word
Time's on our side and the worlds' greatest fans
Are feeding the flame of our hearts

There's always someone who is bitching and shouting
Rambling and tramping - intruding and crowling
We came to spread the word no matter what they're saying
Over and over - always, forever!

The favoured few are marching again
Destined for spreading the word
Time's on our side and the worlds' greatest fans
Are feeding the flame of our hearts
