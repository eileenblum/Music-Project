The dark is calling
In the absence of light
There's nothing left to pray
The curse is moving
And there's still fear
It's so silent I can't hear you breath

Still forgotten, still beloved
No more dreams
Angel wings a devil's heart and you
No more love and no more tears
Just silent screams
I'm living in the shadows lost in fear
Until I disappear
To the place where angels die

Am I dreaming
And am I still alive
This is what you call hell
It didn't help to drink your blood
I was shattered deep inside
So I bleed, I bleed

Still forgotten, still beloved
No more dreams
Angel wings a devil's heart and you
No more love and no more tears
Just silent screams
I'm living in the shadows lost in fear
Until I disappear
To the place where angels die

The dark is calling
In the absence of light
There's nothing left to pray

Still forgotten, still beloved
No more dreams
Angel wings a devil's heart and you
No more love and no more tears
Just silent screams
I'm living in the shadows lost in fear
Until I disappear
To the place where angels die
To the place where angels die
To the place where angels die
