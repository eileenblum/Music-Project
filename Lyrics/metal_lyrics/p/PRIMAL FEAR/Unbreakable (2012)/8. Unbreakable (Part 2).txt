Born to lead, there's no defeat
Midnight hour - time is standing still
Do you understand my whisper
Do you hear the wind shout, no good will

Shadow's haunted, eagles fly
History repeats - what you fear most
Bullets fly and blood runs cold
I'm your evil nightmare - I'm your ghost

Raise your fist - walk with me through the fire
Come with me through heaven and hell
Chroming wheels and thunder roars
We fight demons and war
You will see, it's all true in the end

Raise your fist - walk with me through the fire
Come with me through heaven and hell
Chroming wheels and thunder roars
We fight demons and war
We're born to raise some hell

You will be shattered deep inside
And your primal fear is on the rise
Then all hell is breaks loose
You've been left out in the cold and ice

Out of hell into the sun
There's no tomorrow
You can run
No revenge - no liberty
You can hear a bullet and a gun

Raise your fist - walk with me through the fire
Come with me through heaven and hell
Chroming wheels and thunder roars
We fight demons and war
You will see, it's all true in the end

Raise your fist - walk with me through the fire
Come with me through heaven and hell
Chroming wheels and thunder roars
We fight demons and war
We're born to raise some hell
