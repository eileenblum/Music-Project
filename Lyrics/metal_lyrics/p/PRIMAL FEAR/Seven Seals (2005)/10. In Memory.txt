Lost in my own dream
I'm standing at the wall
Dark clouds are passing by
And the evil takes control

Emptyness is calling
I light a candle now
So many times I've talked to the dead
The reason to go down

In memory of you
Wait till the morning dew
It hurts my soul, it kills my mind
In memory of you
It feels so dark inside
Waiting till the morning light

Walking all alone
A red sky, the morning comes
I take you with me
Down to the crematorium

Once there was a secret
And nobody will find out
So many times I've talked to the dead
The reason to go down

In memory of you
Wait till the morning dew
It hurts my soul, it kills my mind
In memory of you
It feels so dark inside
Waiting till the morning light
