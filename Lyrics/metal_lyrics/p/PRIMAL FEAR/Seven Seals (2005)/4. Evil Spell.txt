The devil is dealing
With illusions and dreams
He takes no money that is sure

Gave in to temptation
The contract is done
Now I caught there's no cure

Haunted by demons from hell
A slave to the evil

I live under an evil spell
Condemned to hell
I live under an evil spell
A slave to the dark
I live under an evil spell

Once you've made the deal
You're a creature cold and blind
The room of damnation has no way out

A cold hearted beast
I'm not dead nor alive
My soul is rotten to the core

Haunted by demons from hell
A slave to the evil

I live under an evil spell
Condemned to hell
I live under an evil spell
A slave to the dark
I live under an evil spell
