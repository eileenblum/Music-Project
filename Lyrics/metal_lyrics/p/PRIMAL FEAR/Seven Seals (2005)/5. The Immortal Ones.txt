Our final destination
Silent is the howling of the night
Shadows in the twilight
The doom will change
Until the sun will rise

Inner feelings just a spark explodes
Under cover - black's our life

We are, we are
We are the immortal ones
We went to hell and back again
We are, we are
We are the immortal ones
We went to hell and back again

Once dead we went to heaven
Or was it only one deception now
Fooled by the false prophets
Back from hell
They locked us into the tower

The creators of the universe
Under cover - black's our life

We are, we are
We are the immortal ones
We went to hell and back again
We are, we are
We are the immortal ones
We went to hell and back again
