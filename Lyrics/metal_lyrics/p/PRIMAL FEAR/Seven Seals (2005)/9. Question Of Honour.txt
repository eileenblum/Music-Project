I - I've seen it all before
Heading north the parole
I sit here and watch it all come down
A mile away from hell
Back in a foreign land
But will tomorrow ever come

No regrets, no reason why
Release me, I'm dying

We stood side by side
Everybody's asking why
We had a dream, it ended in screams
They sold us as a question of honour

A flash of a shtogun blast lightens the dark
Dan dies in a pool of blood
A jet's coming close as gas hits my nose
All the prayers came too late

No regrets, no reason why
Release me, I'm dying

We stood side by side
Everybody's asking why
We had a dream, it ended in screams
They sold us as a question of honour

The night has fallen but I'm still awake
My chances at zero
Breath for the last time, help's out of reach
No time for heroes

No regrets, no reason why
Release me, I'm dying

We stood side by side
Everybody's asking why
We had a dream, it ended in screams
They sold us as a question of honour
