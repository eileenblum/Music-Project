To be real friends for eternity
This is the oath, we once swore
Honestly and morality
These are goals we're fighting for

Always the aim in mind
We're willing to succeed
To fight not disinclined
Our way we will proceed

Your will is my will
Your fate is my destiny
In good as in bad times
Our union will ever be

Endless trust in our loyalty
Law is to be, friends till the end
Your life is precious
As precious as mine

I give you my soul into your hands

Always the aim in mind
We're willing to succeed
To fight not disinclined
Our way we will proceed

Your will is my will
Your fate is my destiny
In good as in bad times
Our union will ever be
