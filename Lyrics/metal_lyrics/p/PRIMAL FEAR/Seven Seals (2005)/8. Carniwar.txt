The valley of darkness
A place hostile and cold
There's no light where the dark makes you fear

Many souls lost their spirit
Many heroes have died
This is a war without frontier

Carniwar
You're dead if you're not fast enough
Carniwar
Your life hangs by a thread
Carniwar
Your life is just a piece of crap
Carniwar
You might as well be dead

You might win if you are strong
You might loose if you are weak
Close your eyes when you take your last breath

Feel the cold of the winter
Feel the heat of the fire
Cannibal warfare diabolic death

We're trapped in this jungle
This hell will drive me insane

Carniwar
You're dead if you're not fast enough
Carniwar
Your life hangs by a thread
Carniwar
Your life is just a piece of crap
Carniwar
You might as well be dead
