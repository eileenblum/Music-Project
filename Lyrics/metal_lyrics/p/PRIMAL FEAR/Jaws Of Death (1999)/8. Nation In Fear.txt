Watching this planet
From far out a space
The pearl in a shadow of darkness
A fled into nowhere, without destiny

These human killers, victim's won't be seen
About progression - without charity
Nation in fear - why are fighting
Nation in fear
The world in the eyes of child

One nation - one nation in fear
One nation in fear

Two years are gone
Since we left mother earth
Surrounded by ruins - it looks altered
All covered in dust
Surrender to the seer

There's nothing left
Where's is our mankind gone
Or were our lonely brothers tired of life
Nation of fear - why are we fighting
Nation in fear
The world in the eyes of child

One nation - one nation in fear
One nation in fear
