Don't you see the danger,
Coming over you
Don't act like a stranger
Don't live like a fool
Corruption - destruction
It's always the same
Illusion - confusion
The world lives in pain

Hideous &amp; hateful, it cuts like a knife
Money &amp; business are counting our lives

Fight to survive - the worlds in disguise
In the heart of darkness
Fight to survive - sedition will rise
In the dark days of your life

Priests &amp; politicians
Tell us what to do
Words to clean up their positions
Never on the loose
Submissions - ignition - to start a new age
Suspicion - tradition - releasing the rage

Hideous &amp; hateful, it cuts like a knife
Money &amp; business are counting our lives

Fight to survive - the worlds in disguise
In the heart of darkness
Fight to survive - sedition will rise
In the dark days of your life
