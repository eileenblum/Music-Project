I came back tonight
From the field of the fight
They collected parts of death
A dimension unknown
I heard screams 'till the dawn
What's the sense behind this mess

I'm feeling so lonely
I'm desperate in the cold
I'm feeling defenseless
Wait for the call - ready to fall
What is this my final moment
Is it real or fantasy
Can't ignore my soul is burning
Wait for the final embrace

This outrage of war
In the name of our god
Killed emotions - every pride
I will fight my own fight
I will break through their lines
Take the last chance to survive

I'm waiting 'till midnight
I'll see my final fight
My hate is religion
Pray to the sky - ready to die

What is this my final moment
Is it real or fantasy
Can't ignore my souls is burning
Wait for the final embrace
