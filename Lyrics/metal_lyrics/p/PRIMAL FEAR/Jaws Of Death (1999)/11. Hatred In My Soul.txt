They've been hunting me,
They have prisoned me
The put torture on my mind
Down in this dark hole, every night alone
A place where generations died

Ain't dead yet - I'm still alive
They gonna pay the price
Hatred in my soul
I'm a beast come feel my anger
Take my vengeance
And I swear to my self - I'm gonna get you
You gonna pay for your crime

Voices in my ears, crying out in fear
It's the point of no return
Ain't dead yet - I'm still alive
They gonna pay the price

Hatred in my soul
I'm a beast come feel my anger
Take my vengeance
And I swear to my self - I'm gonna get you
You gonna pay for your crime

Just out of hand,
In this god damned land
Now this place is gonna burn
Ain't dead yet - I'm still alive
They gonna pay the price

Hatred in my soul
I'm a beast come feel my anger
Take my vengeance
And I swear to my self - I'm gonna get you
You gonna pay for your crime
