From the valley of the darkness
The Elder says nobody has returned
It's always been a challenge for me
To find adventure - to face the fear

I made my mind up to go
I'll give my life just to know

Save a prayer
Beyond imagination
So many signs just tell me to stop
I feel a certain energy
That leads me to the jungle of the dark

Oh my visions getting clear
What is behind eternal fears

Save a prayer

Forgotten land - i'm reaching the end - it's fading to
Black - save me
I made my own great escape
And if you miss me it's too late

Save a prayer
Forgotten land - i'm reaching the end - it's fading to
Black - save me
