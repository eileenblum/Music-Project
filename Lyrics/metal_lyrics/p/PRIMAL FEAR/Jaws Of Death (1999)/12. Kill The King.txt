[Originally performed by Rainbow]

Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger and life about to spill
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the King
Tear him down

Kill the King
Strike him down

Power, power it happens every day
Power, devour all a long the way
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the King
Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the King
Tear him down
Kill the King
Got to take him crown

Kill the King
He'll role no more
Strike him dead
The people roar
Kill the King
Take his dead
Down, down, down, down
Oh, kill, oh, kill, oh, oh
