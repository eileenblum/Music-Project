This night, i died a thousand times
I had some doubts, saw into her eyes
Her gypsy heart just beats in pain
I hold her hand
We walk through the rain

I'm standing here, she's standing there
Uh i can't get her out a my mind
I call her name, she's acting strange
This could be the last time

When the night comes
It's so unreal
When the night comes
It's just dream

We fight against our deep desires
Her energy can set a heart on fire
What comes around just comes around
She looked into the palm of my hand

She would no tell, this hidden spell
But i can't get her out a  my mind
She won't reply, the last goodbye
I know, it was the last time

When the night comes
It's so unreal
When the night comes
It's just dream
