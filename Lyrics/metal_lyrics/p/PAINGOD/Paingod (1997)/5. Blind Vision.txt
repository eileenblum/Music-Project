Your life is contradiction
Feeding off your affliction
Blind vision
Pray for a world that's ending
While all your walls are burning down
Blind vision

Why does it have to be
Black and white for you to see
You feel the pressure, you feel the pain
Can't see the truth that you wish to attain

[Repeat first verse]

Fuck the lies you tell to me
I live my life my own way
Appearances can be deceived
Twist the image of all that you see

[Chorus:]
Pain inside yourself, blind vision

Deny all you see, false reality
Blinded by deceit
Christ statue bleeding
Flowing to the alter
Useless to try, blind vision dies

[Chorus]
