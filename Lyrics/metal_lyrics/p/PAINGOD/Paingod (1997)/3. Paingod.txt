Lay down your idols and your cross
The world is cold and merciless
These books and prayers you chant are false
These scars can never heal

Pray for pain to the god that breeds your shame
Cleanse your soul as you slowly numb your brain
There's no forgiveness for your existence

Distorted image on your wall
Your god is laughing as your crawl
He kicks you and you roll over like a dog
But you keep begging for more

Pray for pain to the god that breeds your shame
Cleanse your soul as you slowly numb your brain
There's no forgiveness in ignorance's bliss 

[Chorus:]
On your knees to the Paingod

I see the sickness that reflects in your eyes
Uncover the anguish you try to disguise
Your mask of faith has sealed your fate
You've fallen to your knees
Your true face is revealed

You thought you'd be rewarded with paradise
Instead you've been blessed with eternal life
It's too bad 'cause you've been had
The pain will never end

Now you pray for pain

[Chorus]
