I feel the pain inside, deep inside
I feel the pain in your mind
I see the pain inside, deep inside
I see the pain in your mind

Stuck, dead end, no progress
Looking forward or behind
There's no win, and no way out
The blind are led by the blind

[Chorus:]
Your resistance and denial
Will surely bring you down
You've been stranded and defiled
And now you play the clown

Questioning the reason I'm here
And if there's really one at all
Two steps forward for three steps back
Pressing on, I'll never fall

[Chorus]

I feel the pain inside, deep inside
I feel the pain in your mind
Searching for your purpose, your lot in life
Something you'll never find

Drifting on a sea, endlessly, hopelessly
Destination unknown
Busting your ass just to keep it together
Still got nothing to show for it
