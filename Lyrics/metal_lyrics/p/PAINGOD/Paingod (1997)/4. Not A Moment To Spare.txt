What is the answer to the endless question
No time to wander in uncertainty
And now I want it my way

[Chorus:]
Blind people, death is in front of you
Running away from the truth
Voices of your pride, not a moment to spare
Voices of your pride

Inside the question's where you'll find the answer
Reveal the secret of identity
And now I'll do it my way

[Chorus]

Time is of the mind, of the essence
No time to waste on the past in the present
Open your eyes and your mind it will follow 
Dwell on the past, lose your grip on tomorrow

No time for their lies and deceiving
You're all you've got so you better start believing
Focus your mind and your life it will follow
Dwell on the past, lose your grip on tomorrow

Voices of your pride, not a moment to spare
Voices of your pride 

No time for all their pointless empty questions
No time to waste on those without direction

[Chorus]
