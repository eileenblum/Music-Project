Congregating horde across the sky 
The necromantic saucer 
Ancient pilgrims led by something wise 
The monolithic altar 

Tears of sorrow gushing from your eyes 
When lent your gaze upon them 
Congregating horde across the sky 
Salvation from the lies 

In times of emptiness we lift our heads 
The race that once brought me to life 
Rejoice and fear them, they're the one true god 
Awake me from eternal sleep 

Sonic horror rips across the skies 
The animals hide 
Out from hovering battleships they stride 
The masters of the sky 

Lord of the skies 
One true god 
Masters of the sky
