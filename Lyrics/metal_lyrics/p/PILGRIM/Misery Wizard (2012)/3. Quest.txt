Across the shimmering wasteland 
In temples bathed in gold 
Preserved by beasts of legend 
Are treasures rich and old 

The massive gates grind open 
When uttered magic rites 
Equipt with sword and lantern 
I quest for what's inside 

Upon the dust-hewn altar 
A crystal shines its light 
Defended by the keeper 
The jewel of endless life 

A battle with the keeper 
The evil pharaoh's blight 
He raises his wand towards me 
I raise my sword to fight
