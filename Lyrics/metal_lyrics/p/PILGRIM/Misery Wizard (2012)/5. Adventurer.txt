Adventuring under dying skies 
Always looked upon by evil eyes 
To the fortress we ride to contest 
Evil wizard and put him to rest 

On this pilgrimage we've just begun 
Black sword shimmering in the setting sun 
Tell the elders of the battles won 
Resist the greed of man until our lives are done 
Yeah!
