Perched upon my oaken throne 
In solitude I lie alone 
In the void a sweet release 
In darkness I can feel at peace 

Don't you torture me 
I'd feel better if left alone 
In my solitude 
On a quest for the secret of kings 
I won't pay my debts 
To the men who conceived me 
In a better world 
Send my prayers on the whispering wind 

As I stare through realms black 
I see the demon staring back 
Crimson eyes and serpent tongue 
The pilgrimage has just begun
