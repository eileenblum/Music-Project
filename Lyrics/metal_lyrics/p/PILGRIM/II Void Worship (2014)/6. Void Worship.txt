I walk with a demon
Everyday in the shadow
My candle's barely burning
I can't see in the dark

I dream of salvation
Everyday in the sunshine
Brother, can't you hear me crying?
I am lost in the dark

I march into the sunrise
Towards the white gates of freedom
On a quest for the answer
I am searching for freedom
