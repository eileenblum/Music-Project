Cast out from the sky realm
From the kingdom in heaven
Sentenced to serve out my years
Protecting the innocent
And defending their honor
And keeping the demons at bay

Surveying the sigils
For signs of weakness
And guarding the portals to worlds
My job is lonesome
But I'll be a legend
And humans will cry out my name

I'll come to rectify this land
And purge you where you stand
For every beast and man
I'll come for every time I'm needed
Until my work's completed
Suffering for my lord
