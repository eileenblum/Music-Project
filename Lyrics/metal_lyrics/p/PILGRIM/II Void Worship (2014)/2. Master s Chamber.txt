In the master's chamber
I was turned to stone
His words then dance like fire
And burned me away
Whispering the secret
Long sought after prose
He cast a spell upon me
And faded away

When I had awakened
I lay on the floor
My head was spinning madly
I couldnât see
I stumbled to my bedroom
To rest my weary soul
Was the master real
Or was he a dream?
