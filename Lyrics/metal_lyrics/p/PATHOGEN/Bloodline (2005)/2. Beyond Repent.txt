Here I stand all alone...Punishment done
Here I hide to atone...All my cares gone
But then I was forced to be the leper of you all
An object of scorn
And the harder I clung to you the more I realised
It was forlorn
Forlorn beyond repent

Set free your hatred for me
Let it fly high enough to be unseen
Then purity may begin to seed
Let it fly far enough so that you may be...

Forlorn beyond repent

Oh please God save me
From this wasted life
Before the rise of the dawn
Where death may die...
May die

Approaching on the horizon come the messengers of fear
They ride with eyes staring ice-cold

For here it comes again, searing through my head
Melting to my core
The insane night confusion sheds
Yet I yearn for more

Seething over my mind
Writhing ghoul of black
Loathing forever time
The day I turned my back
Needing for my life
Heeding to the word
Feeding the sacred hive
With morals never learned

Engulfing me more with each sunrise
Comes the lashing pain of dark
Flowing through my body the hopeful fear
As the life drains from my heart...

Numb, cold, lost...
