We have come...

There lies an unwritten law
By which we live
That those who can not endure
Will fall...
Will fall away

Searing through the void
We live to hunt and you're our game
We want your hell
So you must fall
You've been given time
More than ample to prepare
Be ready now
For the final maul
In all of our lives
We've never seen the likes of you
Your petty wars
Turn you into pawns

And the strong shall live
As has been for evermore
Do not regret
It is the way of all time...
