When I was a child
I was told the things I could not do
Locked in eternity, deep inside
Stop me from being known, by you
Now these years have passed
Upon this alter strapped down I lie
Charged with words I didn't speak
To rid me of my cowering life

Knee-deep in bloody gore

Evisceration, knee-deep in bloody gore
Disentombed, to work your foul deeds me
You will know what is the real me
End this being labeled mockery
Labeled deformity

You can't know the pain

End this being labeled mockery
End this being labeled deformity

Deformity
