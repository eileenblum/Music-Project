Insane...
The being that rules the night
Believe...
Let the one take flight
But why did you have to run off and leave me for
And left with an evil smile

Oh no, my little whore is dead

And then you will see,
That life is not so easy,
On the other side of the wall,
Where huntsmen and evil crawl.
This time did you run for
You run and a knock on
The fence I know you
Will feel the wildlands
And the fire inside
