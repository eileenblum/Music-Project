I have lived my life how you demanded
I require no explanation for the lies you founded
I had no thoughts, desires, control of needs
I willfully ate which you continued to feed
You always played me like a puppet, used me
Kept me locked up inside my head, exploited me
Shells of past lived experiences now but ghosts,
All that was me had been forever lost.....

Now I've broken free from your constraints,
Better watch your back for my knife of hate

I laugh as your smile turns into fear
I slaughter all that which you hold dear
I now take back from you what you took from me
I tear from your mind your will to be
Now that the tables have turned, you are screwed
Your tyranny of hatred has become unglued
Bare before me, your body naked and skinned
Fight if you want, but you will never win....

Now I've broken free from your constraints,
Better watch your back for my knife of hate

Time to die...
See your maker shine through the silver light
Time to die...
Blinded by your own second light
Follow me...
Through the valley on the last crusade
Be with she...
As you will know the true meaning of pain

Now I've broken free from your constraints,
Better watch your back for my knife of hate
