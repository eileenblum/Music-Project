Havoc wreaked in silent stare
A target gaze,
For life I wonder
Spun down by fury of disease
So end the hunger now...

Crimson rage, bleeding eye
Weeping wound, frenzied cry
Whirlwind of fury approaching nigh
Driven on by bleeding eye

Velvet haven, often so warm
How I desire thee
But brimming with life blood as you are now,
Invokes an absence of entry...
Enfold me, enfold me,
Enfold me my scarlet queen
Abstinence leads to punctured shrine
From bleeding eye

I'll take you here by my side
You are the weakest one
Cast off these bleeding shackles
Unladen messenger of white

Captured need
Have I won
Struggle now
Let me in...
