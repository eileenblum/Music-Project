Searching now for fallen kind
Knowledge and relics they've left behind
Watching close for needed sign
Forever seek.....The fallen kind

Shining outpost, the blue-white sun
Nothing left, dead idols gone
Feel fortitude, weep and run
As perception nears...The blue-white sun

And the blinding bright light engulfed the earth
Denoting the ancients their creed
As their Armageddon shattered the heavens
And pillaged their land once supreme

The hallowed white light impaled mankind
And summoned the winds to change
As purity came and gave her new born
To inherit the earth once again
