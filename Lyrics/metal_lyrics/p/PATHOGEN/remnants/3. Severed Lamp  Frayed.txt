She scans the skiesâ¦

Watching nightfall, the sun it set forever 
Forget my name, a scourge of light 
I am the shadow 
She sips the vile and slips into the darkness 
Sounds the shattering glass 
I will walk this earth forever 
Penance in my pain

The script is writtenâ¦it waits for meâ¦

She walks with a sciatic stride, infectious lie 
Eternal lifeâ¦crushed

Committing herself to prayer too late 
The seal folds open 
Wiping the scales from her eyes 
This was the hour the sun died

She scans the skiesâ¦

Will i wake? i lie on endless slumber 
Recounting demons of the past 
The last i ever felt alive 
Releaseâ¦ 
Release me from my minds own prison 
Tormented byâ¦ 
The deafening ticking of time 
Of timeâ¦

This venom in your veins 
A testament to my own grand failure 
I tried to keep you warm 
But my touch, it turned your skin to dust 
Itâs who you areâ¦ 
This withered soul will never be the same 
I sit here from afar 
And watch your heaven torn asunderâ¦

Tearing at the needles writ 
The entrance of an exit wound 
A blank expression seen 
Covering this self destruction 
Piteous fortuneâ¦ 
She writhes in racks of lust 
For this slow death comes with the tide 
And blows in on you like the seaâ¦

She scans the skiesâ¦

And all that she sees 
Is reflection of god in herselfâ¦
