Oh my god. Everyone sees it but no one takes action
Where is the honor that we once had? The fucking guilt is absolute.
I feel ashamed to be alive. So many died

The only thing I really know is everyone will die alone

I`m so fucking tierd of this life. We suck it dry like parasites.
If i had one breath left I d hold it in and wait for death.

Let it out. All of these feelings we keep to ourselves. They`ll be our death.
You never know when it`s your time. There are no reasons left to smile.
We live our lives and then we die. No gold at the end of the rainbow.

Hold it in and wait for it. One by one

Like cancer we devour each other. Where is the love for thy neighbor?
We`re burning holes in our mothers hearts. No salvation.
Can we make it out alive? Bow down. Accept your fate. Bow down to the lies

People live their lives in ignorance.
Not fully appreciating the precious things in life.
But in the end we will all go out in the same way

The only thing I really know is everyone will die alone

I`m so fucking tierd of this life. We suck it dry like parasites.
If i had one breath left I d hold it in and wait for death.
