I know things I ve done have hurt many around me
And God knows I`m not proud. I`ll stay dead forever. I`m sorry for the pain
I`m sorry for the tears you`ve shed. I`m sorry for everything.
We`ll be one forever. Cause I know what I have done
And I hope I`m still your son

Forgive me mama. I`ll try to make you prouder.
Forgive me mama. I hope I`m still your son.

Now you know my fucking secrets.
For as long as I remember you were always there right beside me.
The only one who ever listened, And I love you forever.
Cause I know what I have done
And I hope I`m still your son

Forgive me mama. I`ll try to make you prouder.
Forgive me mama. I hope I`m still your son.
