I`ve been waiting for something to happen. For something to change,
So I sat in the ruins waiting for him
He came and he found me casping for air.
He hold me in his arms and said you shall be reborn through the ashes.

Now they call me Shiva. God of destruction
I fear fucking no one. I am shiva
Burn

I live in a dream forgotten again. Is this even real.
My scrs are deeper now.
they fear me now for I see all and I show no forgivness
They grind their teeth and bite their lips. They tremble before me.

Now they call me Shiva. God of destruction
I fear fucking no one. I am shiva
Burn

I kill what is rotten so that what is good may flourish
Here comes the pain so cover your eyes.
I`ll crush the world with one arm in each continent

Now they call me Shiva. God of destruction
I fear fucking no one. I am shiva
Burn

And this world will burn.
