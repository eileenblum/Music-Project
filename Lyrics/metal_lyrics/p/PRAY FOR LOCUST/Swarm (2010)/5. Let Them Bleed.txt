All my life I`ve lived a lie.
We have been pushed to the side and I`m sick of this. It`s our turn now.
You better fucking take a bow. I don t know what you`ve been told but at least
I`m not just growing old. Follow me and I`ll set you free.
Slit their and let them bleed.

We re and army and we will never fucking die

No one else may never know if we take this feelings with us down.
But before I fly away my friends and I will make you pay.
And as we re standing at the gates waiting for our resting place.
No remorse left in our hearts. We are one and we are all

No you can`t kill us. And they`ll slit your mainline just to watch you bleed.

We re and army and we will never fucking die
