I walked the streets with a smile. With nothing on my mind.
The came from nowhere and the wanted blood.
They held me down and accused me for the life if a hurtful bitch.
I closed my eyes. With a knife to my throat and fifteen demons around me
It was a moment that shaped me

I turned the key and stepped inside. No thoughts of betrayal.
But when I saw him I died inside. He had done it again,
Broken promises. I closed my eyes

The tears and the blood. Every scar on my body
They are the moments that shaped me.

I took a swing at his head. No consequence in mind.
No I was blinded by all the lies. Oh the blood it was unreal
Overwhelmed by reality. With regrets in a box and broken hands.

The tears and the blood. Every scar on my body
They are the moments that shaped me.
