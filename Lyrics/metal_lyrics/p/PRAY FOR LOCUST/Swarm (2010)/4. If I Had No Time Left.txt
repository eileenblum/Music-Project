As the path of no return is coming to an end. I`ve learned that nothing in this
life is sure. Only love and death is pure.

If this was my last song and i had no time left. I beg you. Remember.
You gave me everything.

I have done things i regret. I`ve sacrificed my blood and sweat
just to see the ones I love grow old and die from high above. I think of this
alone at night
I think what if I had no time. I wish that I could make things right.
Tell my friends I`ve said goodbye

If this was my last song and i had no time left. I beg you. Remember.
You gave me everything.

I`m ready for the end. I`m ready to repent my sins.

Life is just a fucking lie as hate is burning in the sky.
And if I really had to go please remember all my love/loss
