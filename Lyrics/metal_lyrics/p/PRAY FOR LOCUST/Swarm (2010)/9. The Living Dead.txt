You better run fast, Pray for your life cause we will never stop
And we will never fucking die. No segregation. Everyone`s game.
We`ll slit your fucking throats and feastt upon your brains.

Tonight we come for you. There`s nowhere you can hide.
We paint our faces red. We are the living dead.

Watch as the rivers turns into blood as we eat you bit by bit.
Welcome to the fucking dead city.

Tonight we come for you. There`s nowhere you can hide.
We paint our faces red. We are the living dead.

There`s no one that can help you.
There s nowhere you can run so close your fucking eyes,
The only mark you`ll ever leave is your rotting corpse.
We`ve lived inside your nightmares but we`re coming out tonight

Dirty teeth sinking into dying flesh.
Nothing but the screams and the cracking of the bones.
The blood is mixing with the rain on the concrete,
And we have no regrets.

Cause we re the living dead

You better run fast, Pray for your life cause we will never stop
And we will never fucking die

Tonight we come for you. There`s nowhere you can hide.
We paint our faces red. We are the living dead.

We are the living dead.
