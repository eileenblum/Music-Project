She stepped into the shadows. Cold air and the smell of steel.
Ten thousand souls but not a sound. Not a sound.
She scratched the walls and screamd her lungs out. There?s something left.
Something dwells in here with a desire for revenge.

A lost life. She died without a name. Jane doe.
For the indifference of good men.

she lived a life of horror. Slowly descending to her grave
In her life all she knew was hurt
She placed her trust in all the wrong fucking places and just like flowers on a
meadow
she blossomed and then died.

A lost life. She died without a name. Jane doe.
For the indifference of good men.

She is not forgotten. She was loved
Deep inside the dark she will dweill eternity

A lost life. She died without a name. Jane doe.
For the indifference of good men.
