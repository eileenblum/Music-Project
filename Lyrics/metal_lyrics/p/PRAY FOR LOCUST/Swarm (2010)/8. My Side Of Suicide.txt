All these people never had a chance to be all they could be.
They bow their heads. Fear the light. Cry their fucking eyes out.
None of them have the smiles that they deserve

Sometimes I wish I couldn`t see the sickness creep under my skin.
My side of suicide. Sometimes I wish I couldn`t see.
I cannot wake up from this dream. My side of suicide

This world is living in despair. The wolfs are growing fatter.
They eat our dreams and crush our hopes like a fucking cancer.
None of them have the smiles that they deserve

Sometimes I wish I couldn`t see the sickness creep under my skin.
My side of suicide. Sometimes I wish I couldn`t see.
I cannot wake up from this dream. My side of suicide

I m kneeling down looking up into the sky. Give me something
Just a string of hope. If this is it.
If this is your master plan I`ll do what it takes.
I`ll let it burn. There is no god.

Sometimes I wish I couldn`t see the sickness creep under my skin.
My side of suicide. Sometimes I wish I couldn`t see.

I believe what I can see. There is no fucking god
No one looking over you. There is no fucking god
