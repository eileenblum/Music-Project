I'm sick and tired of your ego. I've had enough of all your shit.
You raise yourself high above like you're special.
Don't you think I can see?
Oh I long for the day your world will fall apart.
It's an eye for an eye.
Read my fucking lips. You reap what you have sown.
You've turned your back on those who loved you.
Burning your bridges. Can't you see?
God knows I've reached out to be diplomatic.
But this time you're on your own.
You better Read my fucking lips. You reap what you have sown.
All a man really has. Itâs the choices he makes.
So you better read my fucking lips. You reap what you have sown.
You will reap what you sow.
