I am the darkest demon. I walk between the lines. You will confess before me.
Iâm here to claim my prize. All other gods are useless. I am the king of sin.
This is your final hour. I am your reckoning. God of the underworld.
This is the end of your life so you better bide your time.
There is no way out now. This is the end of your life.
I am the tallest tower. Iâll find you in the dark. Iâll let you bleed for hours.
Rip out your fucking heart. Iâll smash your fucking face in
Youâll know that Iâm the lord when I burn you down.
God of the underworld. Colossus of old.
