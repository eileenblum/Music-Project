The only thing in front of me, the everlasting sleep.
Iâll try to make my journey there as rich as it can be.
Every experience and every single leap is only one step closer to the end of my dream.
Whatâs the meaning of this game called life?
In this world of wonders, hatred and lies.
I still remember the taste of blood. All I behold are you heroin eyes.
The downward spiral is dwindling beneath
The path is all layed out, letâs see where it leads.
The endless cycle of life and death is nothing you can cheat by holding you breath.
This is not what I wanted. This is not what I needed.
This is not what Iâve searched for. This is not who I am.
You are not the one I wanted.
You are not the one I needed.
