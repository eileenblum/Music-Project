You are the canvas Iâm painting with blood. This is the bitter end.
I want to see you give up. Iâll make you scream.
And you will beg for your life but no one will hear you.
The axe shall fall. You deserve it.
I feel this pain every day. I wish there was another way.
But this is my curse and every day the voices are getting worse.
I fucking love it.
I am the angel of death. Iâll let the shadows embrace you.
Iâm your salvation. Youâre my creation. Keep bleeding. Keep dying.
You are the canvas Iâm painting with blood. I will see you give up.
Thereâs nothing you can do to change your fate.
I will never let you go. I will rip you apart.
You will die here cause Iâll never let you go.
Tell me, whereâs your fucking god now? And what if he doesenât care?
