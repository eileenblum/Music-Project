This world is filthy. This world is grey. This world is only what weâve made it.
Weâve stripped the day of every color in it.
This world is dying. This world is dead. Planet earth is taking back and we are in the way. The leaves are curling up and the sky is crashing down.
Itâs too late for repent.
This is the final. This is the end. This is our last breath. The death of everything.
I watch this greyscale show play out before my eyes.
I can see the ruins and taste the tears. Iâm watching it burn.
Cities crumble as the ocean flood the gates. The earth is taking back and we are on our knees. Crushed beneath the weight of the world.
As the apocalypse is knocking on the door the absence of meaning is all weâve got.
The sky is burning.
And we are all on our fucking knees.
