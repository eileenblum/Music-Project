Oh my god where am I?
I feel lost and empty inside. Is this all even real?
This thirst for blood is driving me to the edge.
I don't know why I linger here when I was born to die.
Let the locust tear through my body. âtil it hurts. âTil it hurts.
I feel nothing. No pain and no glory. It's a dead mans curse.
All this hatred inside me. It's piercing my skin.
Tie me down to the altar and leave me with my sins. Oh my god what have I become?
I'm the monster I swore I would never be. Take your knife unto me.
And when there's blood all around you and you're finished with me.
You will climb on the ceilings. You will never be free.
You will never be free.
