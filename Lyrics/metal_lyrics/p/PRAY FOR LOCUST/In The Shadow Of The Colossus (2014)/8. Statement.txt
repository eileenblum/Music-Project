Fuck all you vultures who ever crippled me. No, sincerely, fuck you for stomping on my dreams. Fuck this anxiety for pumping through my veins.
And fuck all you haters for getting in my way.
Never again will I let you define who I am.
âHe is the problem.â Thatâs something you said. Letâs see how you feel when youâve layed in my bed. Fuck you and your reasons why. I donât want to hear your lies.
So many moments you could have made things right. Fuck every bit of life that youâve got left. And one last thing.
Fuck every breath you take.
You are a coward. Thatâs nothing new. And I will never give a fuck about you.
Never again will I let you define who I am.
No.
