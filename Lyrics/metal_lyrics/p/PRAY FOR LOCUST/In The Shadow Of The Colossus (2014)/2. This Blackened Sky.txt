Goodbye opressor. Iâll leave you here with no regrets. and Iâll shed no tears.
Control is what you preach. Cleaverly concealed behind your rotten teeth.
Push your fingers down my throat. Try to force it down. Put your money where your mouth is. And I will take you to hell.
I will be honest. I will be fair. Just fall to your knees and solemnly swear that you will never take another breath.
Push your fingers down my throat. Try to force it down. Put your money where your mouth is. And see if I give a fuck.
Iâll never bow down to no one. Youâll never bring me to my knees.
No.
Breath in. Bleed out. Weâve only got one life.
Breath in. Bleed out. under this blackened sky.
I wonât. I wonât give in to you.
No more. Never.
Weâve only got one life under this blackened sky.
