I used to give a fuck. i used to dream. I used to love.
I used to care what happened to this world.
I used to have a dream. i used to love. i used to feel.
I used to live and I used to cry.
Back when i was alive.
Ten thousand dead. And i just dont give a fuck.
Ten thousand dead. So fucking what?
So fucking rot inside your tombs as you curse my indifference.
Now Iâm just empty inside.
I dont care.
