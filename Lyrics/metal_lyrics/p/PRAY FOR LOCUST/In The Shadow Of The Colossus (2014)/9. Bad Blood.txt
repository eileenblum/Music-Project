You donât know a thing about me. My struggles, a mystery to you. Hate is all that
Iâve got left. So hate is what Iâll give to you. You better run for your life.
Iâll be you annihilation. I will tear you apart just to see if you got a heart.
Iâll be your annihilation. I will burn you alive. May you suffer in hell you cunt.
There is nowhere you can run. Thereâs no place that will escape my eyes.
My vengeance will never let me sleep. And you must pay for what youâve done.
May you suffer in hell.
I know your secrets. I know who you are. And I will find you. It wonât take long.
I will hunt you, coward.
