Just let me go.

I want to see the sun. I want to see the ocean one more time.
Just leave me here.

Let the ocean take me. Embrace my broken soul.
This life is not for me. Just let me go.

I wear this hollow crown. I wear this broken heart. I wear theese anchors that pull me apart.
I wear this hollow crown. I wear this broken heart. I wear theese anchors that pull me down.

Let the ocean take me. Embrace my broken soul.
This life is not for me. Just let me go.
Let the ocean take me. Embrace my broken soul.
This life is not for me. Just let me go.

Let the ocean take me. Embrace my broken soul.
This life is not for me. Just let me go.

I'm standing on the edge. I hear the (kÃ¶r) ocean's roar (kÃ¶r slut).
And I'm waiting for it's ruthless embrace.
And as the sun goes down the water's (kÃ¶r) filling my lungs (kÃ¶r slut).
Let the ocean take me.
Let the ocean take me home.

I wear this hollow crown. I wear this broken heart. I wear theese anchors that pull me apart.
I wear this hollow crown. I wear this broken heart. I wear theese anchors that pull me down.

Let the ocean take me. Embrace my broken soul.
This life is not for me. Just let me go.
Let the ocean take me. Embrace my broken soul.
This life is not for me. Just let me go.

Just let me go.
I will wait for you here in the deep.
