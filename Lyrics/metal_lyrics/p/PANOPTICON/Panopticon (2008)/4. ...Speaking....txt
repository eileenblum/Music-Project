The ability to speak brings value to a life. The ability to beg, plead, rationalize.
Jaws that embrace the horror of this silent holocaust. Desecrate the earth with consumption and loss.
Disrupted natural order. Ecological blasphemy. An insult to our integrity, ingest the horror, the devastation and death, when nature and nurture are self-negating, parasite till there's nothing left. Caged in factories and commercial shelves, the new definition of hell, The suffering and loss. We rape the land for industry, kill and eat the living things with no regard to the cost.
