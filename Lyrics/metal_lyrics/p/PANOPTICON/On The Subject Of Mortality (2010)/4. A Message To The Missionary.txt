The institution of your faith is not worth dying for, not worth living for,
worth crying for. You want us on our knees not only to pray, but to be
enslaved. We cannot fight when we can't stand.

You've locked us in a cage, taught us to be afraid to be free.

We are told of visions by those who cannot see. We are told to listen by those
who cannot hear. We are given salvation based on terror and fear, denied this
life for a day dream in red letters and gold trimmed pages.

One nations ethnocentric perception of god cannot be the only end. Your
internecine is supported by scripture, it's the only credibility your willing
to lend:

Lies to support lies.
