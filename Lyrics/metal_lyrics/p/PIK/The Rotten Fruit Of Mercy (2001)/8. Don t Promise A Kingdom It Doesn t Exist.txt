Demons, witches, wizards with me
I like their company
Darkness, stars, winds it's my world
I feel safely in
I'm the flame that burns your sick
Pest from inside
I show to world your rachitic lies
Which you preach
I'm a witness of your deeds
The bells are beating lamentable tones
In those rich crimson garments
You still pray to the plastic saints
I see the fear in your eyes
Don't promise a kingdom it doesn't exist
I see the fear in your eyes
Don't rape the world with your false
Relics
In temples where you're cleaning your
Guilty consciences
From your confessional like rats
You licking up the sins that are
Whispered to you
It excited and rapes your brains,
Uncover you animal desires
So, take look in the crystal mirror
Than you see your false decaying faces
