Drown in armchair of my dark room
I call you my occult mentor
You are living in my wise head
                     Demon
While the temple bells are silent
You're manifest in the candle light
Nestle me in the cradle of spell
Sing me my dark lullaby
My infernal majesty
The visions of the rape by clergy
The religions endless wars
Are reflect from the prophecy
Of the darkest beyond world
My thoughts are your secret home
From ever you are my guest
I listen to your devils tales
Sing me my dark lullaby
My infernal majesty
