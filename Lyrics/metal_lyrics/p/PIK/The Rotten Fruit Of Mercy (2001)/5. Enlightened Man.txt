In my morbid strange brain
Something's happened - I'm enlightened
I became a god - why not
I'm sick enough to be one of them
I tell you, listen to my words
Not to false prophets and liars
Now, I've got to find a name for me
'Cause all gods got names
I create a color Kingdom
Kingdom which I promise you
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, hosanna
Now is the time to use the old
Sure master's trick
I don't let the other pagans to my
Trough
I'm a revengeful and jealous creature
Who's against me and my words
Must die
Man, woman, child or beast
Who's against my commandments
Must die
Pray to me I'm enlightened
Pray to me I'm cranky
