They miss the bloody torture chambers
And the witch, break on the wheel
It's the symbol of the last crusade
Now comes the army of the devil
Empire
From the ages unrespected
By the clergy that thanks him exist
To the mean mob with cross
Into the mug they on knees crawl
For the hypocrisy absolve
The dark red carped already waits
The lord of many names will come
A ruler of mysterious planets
Suns, seas and unknown worlds
The day is near of the apocalyptical
Truth
The solution of falsify tomes
You've got them scribbled by the wine
With your lust power bishops
Call his names
Satanus, Luciferus, Belialus
