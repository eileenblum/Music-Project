Madness, fear, visions, blood
Religions, blindness, victims of lies
Mass, relics, gods, blessing
Demons, horns, by cross raped mouth
Dogma, dogmas, dogma
Ritual, morbid thought of sin
Murderer wait to stab with hate
Devilish trance, lead you to aim
The crown of thorns
Still deep in his skull
Saintly old man meditating talks
To a wooden idol
And seeing growing black rahitic
Horns of the scapegoat
Saintly old man meditating begs
For the Christian mercy
When he sees the infernal lava
Flowing out from tombs
