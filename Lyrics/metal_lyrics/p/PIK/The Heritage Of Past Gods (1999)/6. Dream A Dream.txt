Close my eyes
My thoughts spread the wings of imagination
I am starting to sail through space
Into the garden of harmony
In that garden of a small clear brook
Welcomes me
Inviting me
I quench my thirst and see the beauty
Which is only here to be seen
I dream a dream
I dream a dream
I dream a dream
I dream a dream
Drifting into infinity
I am on the way amongst their worlds
To find more gardens and brooks of clear water
