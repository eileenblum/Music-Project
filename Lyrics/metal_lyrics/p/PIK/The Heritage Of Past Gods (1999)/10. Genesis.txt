Atmosphere cools after the Big Bang
Heavy raindrops groove structures
Which slowly transforms to land and mountains
Tearful winds filling space
A new beginning happens in the universe
One of millions in the Milky Way
Somewhere far away a white dwarf
Finished his way
Gone out forever
Brightness appears at the horizon
The sun takes in hand the sleeping crust
And the old ice coat wrapped forever
Changes slowly into deep oceans
Some day lord on bird wings will come
To soar life in the holy garden
The new colonists will call him God
Then again what else
Because he created Earth
