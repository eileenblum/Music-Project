The colours of the world are living in them
Their shapes are strange
The energy which pulsated inside is unknown
Healthgiving
Scattered around our earth
And remembering the beginning
Maybe someday they will talk
Expose the truth of the gods
In those stones the truth is enclosed
In those stones gods' mystery
Like iced matter they are quiet
Waiting for the key
Time fears us
They fear time
The genesis will be born again
When I hold them in my hands
The energy is flowing
I know where the truth is
But some of them still don't understand
