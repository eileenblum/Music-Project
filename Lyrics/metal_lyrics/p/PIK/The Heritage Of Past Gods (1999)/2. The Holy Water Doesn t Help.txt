The day is getting over
Silence
Silence
In the cold walls of the cloister
Crying
Cry of the priest
Cry of the traitor
Pain
He was young and taught his sheep
There was a girl
Still a child
Unprotected
The priest desired her
Sperm bursted out
Who led him to do it
God
He's hidden between the walls of the monastery
Can't see into the mother's eyes
Praying for brothers like him
Who are under the protection of the cross
Still bringing shame
Cry of the priest
Cry of the traitor
Pain
Cry of the priest
Cry of the traitor
Pain
The holy water doesn't help
The holy water doesn't help
