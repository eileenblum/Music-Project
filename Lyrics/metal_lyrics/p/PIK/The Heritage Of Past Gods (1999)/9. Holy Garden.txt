Somewhere in the universe it's hanging still
A magic planet
The holy Earth
I don't know who created it
But I am sure that this is what the demons and gods were fighting for
Are we fruits of right
Right or wrong
In that garden of tears and illusions
Cries of children I hear everywhere
Why are they crying in that promised land
Their prayers do not help
They are still in pain
Try to reach their mothers
But they are rapid and gone away
Was the prophets right
Is this the end of mankind
What is the direction of the human beings
Why do believes start do die
Why do the holy gardens burn
The kingdom spill bloody tears
Have the demons received their power back
Dark
Dark
Dark rain in our hearts
Death is looking into the cradle of life
Deep
Deep
Deep in our brains
Lives evil by somebody's creations
Bitterness
Bitterness
Bitterness in my mouth
Disappointed without a strange
Fear
Fear
Fear devours our world
Children screaming for their future
