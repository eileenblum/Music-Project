I want to know the secrets of life
Why we are
On whose recommendation
Our reproduction goes on
Are we a part of an experiment
Who the fuck was Lord
Experiment
I think so
Why
The Holy Book talks about the Jewish Nation
Which spent forty years in a desert
They had only Manna to eat
So the Lord decided
Why the fuck was Lord
Are we the result of an unsuccessful experiment
Because how else can I understand human imbecility
