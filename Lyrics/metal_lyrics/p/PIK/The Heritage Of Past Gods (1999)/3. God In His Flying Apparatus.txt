Who wants to make me believe
That in this universe
We are alone
Because we are the chosen nation
If god was a god I ask
Maybe only human beings like us
Because in the bible I read that
On the Jabel Moussa he fell in smoke and flames
I want an answer to my questions
Why you stammer priests
You don't know what to answer
I suggest the truth
I ask in the name of mankind
Why does god need such technical toys
