Human head in the body of a lion
Proudly watching the gates of temples
Hybrids described by history
We are not a sick fantasy
In labs of nonexistent towns
Hidden under earth
Madmen mixing their genetic cocktails
Connecting the human beings with animals
Deep in hidden labs
Under secret domes
Drowsed in iced test tubes
Waiting for hatch
Hybrids - hidden in glass cocoons
Hybrids - bitter genetic cocktail
Hybrids - reptiles with human heads
Hybrids - heritage of past gods
