Since thousands of years
They are rammed into earth
In cosmic truth rest
Drowsy
Still keeping their secrets
Secrets of faith
Secrets of life
Secrets of death and gods
Only wind holds in hands that naked pyramids' walls
Sometimes the rain washes the dust
Which nestles them like a coat
Every day comes the sun
And burns down the scars of time
