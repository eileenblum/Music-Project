Dead eyes staring back through the past of mine
Memories remind me of what I created so long ago
Shadows as cold as winter, the night falls in my heart
Thousand thorns of silence stick in my throat

Weird screams clang into the darkness
Ice-cold chains cut my flesh, the creature stares in my eyes again
On bleeding knees we crawl in here
One by one, blood for blood, you will die by my hands tonight

Iâve seen your face but was too blind to use my eyes
Memories of good times, I feel them fading away
Crystal clear voices in my head tell me how to die
Theyâll freeze my heaven and darken the sky

Weird screams clang into the darkness
Ice-cold chains cut my flesh, the creature stares in my eyes again
On bleeding knees we crawl in here
One by one, blood for blood, you will die by my hands tonight

The sand is running, through my hands, the time is fading and memories
Drown my eyes, an icy stream rises up in my veins, it feels so coldâ¦
I kneel down in front of shadows of my former self, with tears in my eyes
And blood on my hands Iâll leave myself behind to die
