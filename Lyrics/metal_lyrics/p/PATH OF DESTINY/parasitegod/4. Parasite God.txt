A Storm of flames, it burnt thou to ashes
And the bladeâs kiss opened thy skin
Plant me in your flesh,
Immerse me in your blood
Let the pain prevail!

Irreligious life dripped through ash and dust
Immersed the earth and sealed my volition
Nothing remains but
A shadow at the gates of my grave
Of my grave

Hear my voices, hear my words
My will shall be the only law
Let me raise from the dead again
Let the stars glow for the last time this century

Remember! The suffering is great!
But hate will re-erect my reign

The beat of your life pumps zealâs venom
Your red blood turns to black dust
The chains of slavery cut deep in thy flesh
These scars of a new world order

Galaxies collide into on another
And the will of my people
Is broken and gone
Only one fact remains
I will slave the parasite
My blood is your eternity
So was it written and so will it be done!
