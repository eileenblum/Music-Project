Darkness left the night behind
And also fills the days
Light is black
Air, thick as fog

Eyes that see no more
Fingers grapping after shades
And souls that await execution
Or just for a single thing to happen

Futureâs of a stillborn kind
Canât find a way through the fog
In that weâre shrouded
With bare hands we try to
Build up thrones
But all we reap is emptiness

The cold becomes our friend
Weâre sentenced to suffer
From heaven thereâs no salvation due
Emptiness reigns
Claims its dominion
Itâs dominion!

Forever bound here
Forever dying for a relief
Our flesh will become stone
And drag us down to
The ground
Where we will rot forever

We will lie and decay to
What we are supposed to be
Scum under our godâs feet
Light is black
Air, thick as fog moving through lungs

Stillborn Future!
Stillborn Future!
