The eyes turn to black, old dreams snap me up again
A grey veil coated a dark silhouette
My Fingers started to move; now Iâm out of control
A tremendous purity cloaked my fantasies
And liquid fire leaks through my lanky handsâ¦

Is this truth or am I dreaming again?
The senses overcome by my desire
I fall further, die faster, it feels as cold as winter nights
No heartbeat resounds through the dark embrace

I bleed dry; I feel a cold hand touching mine
Black wings take me far away from this live
My fingers started to move; now Iâm out of control
A tremendous purity cloaked my fantasies
And liquid fire leaks through my lanky handsâ¦

Is this truth or am I dreaming again?
The senses overcome by my desire
I fall further, die faster, it feels as cold as winter nights
No heartbeat resounds through the dark embrace

No blood, no god, no pain, no rain
The darkness filled the eyes with eternal fire
It feeds the rage, permits to pay, pay back all in spades

Blood stained memories; demons unleashed once again
Blood stained memories; ice-cold hands around my neck
Blood stained memories; theyâll chase me wherever I stay

Unleash the memories!
