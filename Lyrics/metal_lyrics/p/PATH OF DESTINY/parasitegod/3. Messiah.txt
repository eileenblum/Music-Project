Now arise! And look up to me
Iâm the master and youâre the slave
Cry for me and feel my pain
Like it befell me once (before)

Fuel the fire you do not want (for hate)
Let my torments nurture your soul
Refresh on my body
Feel how it enlaces every moment of your existence

New venom will be born from my corpse
Open my neck, saturate your hands
In fire, drink my desire
Feel the depth of this night
The pain of thousand years
And show me all your fears
Your nightmare will come true

Now my son, go and pronounce my existence
What I was, what I am; whatâs born out of my shadows
Let them suffer, let them plead, let them see the termination
Change light in obscurity and pronounce my existence

I am the chaos, I am the war
I am all; tear down your walls
I am hate, I am truth
One more time, let the light glare your mind

I am the messiah; adorn my pate without a crown
Wonât bring redemption for the suffering souls
Bringing the dead, the mischief and obscurity
Rip your soul out of your dead eyes
Glare yourself with my truthfulness
