Youâre faint donât face up to yourself,
you fighting wars you know nothing about.
Youâre not thinking, only let you lead,
you lost your life, but you donât mindâ¦
No you donât mind!

Hit me! Beat me! Iâm the one who scoff on you!
Torture me! Chase me! Iâm the one who will be freeâ¦

Youâre blind, poor souls, exhaust their blood, made
your victims to empty slaves. You only speak with fear and
diffused it. Distress is your life but you donât mind.
No you donât mind!

But those who see you playing games and trust themselves are much
wiser than you ever will be. Violence is you only speech, brutality
your way but we had, what youâll never know!
