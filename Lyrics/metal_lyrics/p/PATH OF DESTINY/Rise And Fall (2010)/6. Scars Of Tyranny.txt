The mankind is fading, the dead will arise.
Bleeding to death with lonesome cries.
Unleash the legions cloaked with thunder,
just look at your century of your demise!

Now look at the decay that you create,
darkness hatred black despairâ¦
An endless winter not seeming to fade,
a desecration no one could repair.
The black winter arise, deadly silent the
world turns to ice.
Wade through the blood of your demise.
The scars of tyranny, your last sacrificeâ¦

A common grave with sin offerings,
your way is paved with corpses. Youâd never feel the suffering,
the blood on your hands adorn your throne.
The black winter arise, deadly silent the world
turns to ice.
Wade through the blood of your demise.
The scars of tyranny your last sacrificeâ¦

The mankind is fading, the dead will arise.
Bleeding to death with lonesome cries.
Unleash the legions cloaked with thunder,
just look at your century of your demise!

Rivers of blood flowing their way, just see how the sky
turns black! Trombones announce your last day before the sea
turns endless red.
