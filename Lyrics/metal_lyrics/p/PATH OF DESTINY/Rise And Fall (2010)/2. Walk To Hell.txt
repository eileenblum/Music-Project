No one could see my face inside,
itâs just a weird countenance with scars donât stop bleeding
No! These wounds will never heal,
wherever I stay, like a ghost during the fog
Itâs a paranoid nightmare and these flames
show me the way!

Now, Iâm sitting here, with something in my mind,
donât know what happened, through all of the time,
now I can see clear, youâre one of a kind
for you I walk to hell, to hell and back again!

Everytime Iâve seen your face, Iâve died a little more inside,
the dream of death arises in me and takes me down in its arms
wherever I stay, like a ghost during the fog
Itâs a paranoid nightmare and these flames show me the way!

Now, Iâm sitting here, with something in my mind,
donât know what happened, through all of the time,
now I can see clear, youâre one of a kind
for you I walk to hell, to hell and back again!

Your tears nurture the rose on my grave, the stone is cold
lemanted from the rain.
For one kiss, that bring me back I still crave,
for you I will die again and again!

I rest in claws of destiny, itâs weird cold outside,
whereâs your breath makes me warm
which makes me feel staying alive?
Wherever I stay, like a ghost during the fog
Itâs a paranoid nightmare and these flames
show me the way!
â¦show me the way!
