Hanceforth alone, drunk in silence, my
heart is so cold and the energy used up
crying black tears, thereâs no way out
I look into the mirror but only see in your face.

The sky will getting darker, the night falls
my creature will suffer, no more staying alive!
Itâs getting colder, the life, will die inside myself
closing my eyes and see in your face again!

Memories suffer me, I canât forget you, thereâs
no way out, I am possessed of you
my tears getting lost, I canât resist this
temptation, last times I pick up the blade
to feel the luck and see my blood.

Seeing my life in visions how itâs flash by my side,
again and again your portrait and a man kneeing in front.
Open slowly my eyes and see the moon in the sky above,
feel the blood on my body, whether I could see you anymore?
