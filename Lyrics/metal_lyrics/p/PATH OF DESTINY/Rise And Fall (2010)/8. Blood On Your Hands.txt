I wonât look in your eyes, beauty like the stars,
shining so glad like a mirror of truth, but I avert
my eyes, it pounds in my chest, youâre a beauty
but ugly like the rest! You are ugly like the rest!

You have to suffer, to be pretty, watch my working
if you dare, lay down in my arms.
Scream! No one will upset my dreams!
Perfection is so nice to play withâ¦

Everybody stares your face, breathless again
think you are perfect, an angel without wings
but I avert my eyes, it pounds in my chest, youâre a
beauty but ugly like the rest! Youâre ugly like the rest!

You have to suffer, to be pretty, watch my working
if you dare, lay down in my arms.
Scream! No one will upset my dreams!
Perfection is so nice to play withâ¦

It stares at me in the mirror, itâs disgusting to
live in this way, the scissors in my hand,
Iâll bring them close to my face and cut out the
truth of my eyes to open up the view of your
pitiable sight, everything turns black but for the
first time I could see your face, and how gorgeous you areâ¦

My fast paced breath drowns out your screams, plays
with your hair and bursts my chest. I feel the blood
flow down my hands, warm and gently, thatâs not
what I want!
