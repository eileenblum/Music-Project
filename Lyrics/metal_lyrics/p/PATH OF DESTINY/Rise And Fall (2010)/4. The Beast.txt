Sadness, pain and loneliness, feelings born
within my soul. I want to be a flame at least
and burn down into ashes but I will never burn.

I am no human, I am no animal,
without mercy but full of greed, I am not
what you think you see! Inside of me a raging beastâ¦

My soul is smashed in some pieces. I want to run
away from the fear. Donât want to be a slave of the others,
just want to walk my way in freedom!

A shining blade, blood on the wall, a still bumping heart
in my ice-cold hands. No one could stop the beast in me!
I am no human, no animal!

I am no human, I am no animal,
without mercy but full of greed. I am not what
you think you see! Inside of me a raging beast.

I donât say a word, Iâll never show my second face.
I shout it out with all my might, with all my might,
with burning eyes in deep dark night.
