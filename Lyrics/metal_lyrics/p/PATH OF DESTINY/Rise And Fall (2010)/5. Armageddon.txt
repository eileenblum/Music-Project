One sees four riders hunting bringing darkness fear and woe,
death and hell was follow them, on their way they pave
War, hunger plague and death, the first four seals are broken.
War, hunger plague and death, the final words are spoken!
See them ride with shadows, with scorching breath they come
to burn down the last instance, the decisive battle is on!

Neither man nor an angel was able to open the seals,
only the holy victim has the power to do, could set the seal
on the destiny

War, hunger plague and death, the first four seals are broken.
War, hunger plague and death, the final words are spoken!
See them ride with shadows, with scorching breath they come

See the war and feel the pain, see the riders by their side, four horse man,
blood behind, there are only three seals left
