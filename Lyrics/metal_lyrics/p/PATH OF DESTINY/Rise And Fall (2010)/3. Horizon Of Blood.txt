This fortress of sorrow will tear my soul apart.
I walk between the worlds Iâd never
seen there before.
I am blinded and captured in the dark,
I am lost in the cold arms of destiny.
Oh, it feels like it isnât a dream. No!
No! Thatâs not what I dream aboutâ¦No! No!

Every step I take, every stare to the amazing
sky tell me, we are all born to die.
I donât know how could I release my spirit out of
this evil misery.

Iâll fail if I could not find back to my own life,
a web of lies wrapped in eternity is choking
my throats and cutting my veins.
It squeezes out my last breath of life.
Oh, it feels like the life is fading inside.

Every step I take, every stare to the amazing sky
tell me we are all born to die.
Please tell me, how could I release my spirit, just tell me,
before I drownâ¦ before I drownâ¦

My last days fall from grace,
what I denied for all my life lay
down in front of my eyes
I am faced with the ruins of my wasted time
