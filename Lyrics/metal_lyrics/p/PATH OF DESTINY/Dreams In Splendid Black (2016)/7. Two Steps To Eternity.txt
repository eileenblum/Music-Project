Darknessâthe house of my soul
I feel the longing
For the space beyond
There is nothing for me to find
In this world of fucking lies

My eyes stare up into heights
Of another sky
In another language it tells me
Somewhere there are yet better days to find

[Chorus:]
Lead me to oblivion
Redemption lies ahead
Maybe I will find a place
Where things are still the same
Just two more steps
And I can touch
And I can see
Forever, eternity

So I take the last chance
And remove the unworthy rest of mine
Only small traces will at least
Touch universes' brink

All heavens are lies
No great behind, no god
Only endless fields of dark masses
Colliding into one another
Smashing the last glimpse
Of my consciousness
