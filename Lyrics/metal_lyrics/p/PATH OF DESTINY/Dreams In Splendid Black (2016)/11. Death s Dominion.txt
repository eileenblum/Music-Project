Frightened I'm awaiting and bleeding here to see
The hour, the hour that it grasps for me
A gentle touch is freezing my soul
Discharging my heart
So that an empty shell resides

[Chorus:]
But I'll be willing and already
Left all things of value behind
Even my emotions
Even my crown
Gained in ecstasy
I move forward
Let death take its mastery
We change the sites
Now I'm the one
Waiting behind
I was never worth holding
The sceptre in my hand
And the reaper proudly wears
The crown again and again

To me dead is a blessing
Opening new chances
Reuniting me with the
Realms I touched
So many years ago
The cage that once held
Me before will embrace me again

We should learn to accept deathâ¦
As it isâ¦
As a noble gift
That saves us from the arrogance
Breeding within the human soul
It teaches us that we're just dust
Under universe's feet

So the abyss calls me
Here at the crest I stand
And from my point of view
It's like a call
The whisper
Of a beloved one
