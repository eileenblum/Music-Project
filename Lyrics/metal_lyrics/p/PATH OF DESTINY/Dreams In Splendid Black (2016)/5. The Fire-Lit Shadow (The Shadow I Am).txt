It gets aliveâthere where all betrayal begins
In the darkened, narrow streets of rape
And with an empty smile of our random world
Melting faces fading in vortexes from beyond

"Good" lost all virginity murdered
More than a thousand times
Stabbed again, again and again
With the knife of deceit

[Chorus:]
And the flames it wields so high
They are of hatred and disgust
And no one will ever feel them
We're already, already burned

I am the flame I yield so high
I am a god of hatred and disgust
And no one will ever feel me
I am just burned by nowâ¦

And in its grace there is no beauty but cruelty
It weaves its soothing arms around my mind
And tears me apart so now I can see
A dreadful, slowly distortion of things I loved before

There is a seed growingâslowly growing
Inside the heart of fucking emptiness
Waiting and dwelling reside within
The fire-lit shadowâthe shadow I am

Now the time has comeâmy religious son
To face everythingâthat in live we have done
I stand in this shadeâfire-lit my blade
What I feel now is full of ignited hate
