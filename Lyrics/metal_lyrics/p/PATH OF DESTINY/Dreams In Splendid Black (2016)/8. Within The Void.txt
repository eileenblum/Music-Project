Welcome to the darkness
Within this emptiness
It's time to say good bye to everything you know
Welcome to pure enlightenment
Within the darkest black
It's about time to say good bye to your appreciation

Within the void I'm introduced to the power of myself
Strengths which come from deep inside my soul
A fire is burningâtelling me that I am still sane
Nothing here that I could fear or even love
I feel no god, neither good nor evil
Solely myself enthroned by inner might

I am the ice cold water within a burning flame
I am the silence that screams for you
I am the darkness shed into the light
I'm the beginning of the end
I am within the void

The eons fade like minutesâwhile seconds seems like years
The towers of your mind are crumbling
Love and light feels like hate
Power and strengths are your major weakness
Expect the unexpectable within the void

...within the void

You are voiceless within word
Deaf while sensing whispers
Full of awareness while asleep
You are dead likewise alive
We are voiceless within word
We are deaf while sensing whispers
Full of awareness while asleep
We are dead likewise alive

I am yourself and you are mine within the void
You are me and I am youâ¦ within
I don't know who you are and you don't know who I am
Inexpressible is the mind within the void

â¦within the voidâ¦
