The towers of hope
Won't ever reach the skies
Amongst the weak an illness reigns
Lay down as sky darkens
And close the eyes to embrace the night
Reaching the point of insignificance
Upon which shadows are built
An effigy of the end in shards of black

Between walls of unconsciousness
Our near Armageddon is already breed
And the horrified faces of our beloved ones
That won't ever draw a breath again
They're haunting for us

[Chorus:]
Dreams in splendid blackâupheavals inside your soul
When twilight crawls the earth all things turn black and fade way
Soon there is nothing leftâleft for you and me
Dreams in splendid blackâphantoms dwelling on this soil
When twilight crawls the earth all things turn black and fade way
Soon there is nothing leftâfor you and me to live for

Demons of the night revel their victory
Over the lightâall is splendid black
Striving for illumination provokes laughter
Among inscrutable eyes
Dwelling on thoughts of insignificance
This blackness leaks my mind
An effigy of the end in shards of black

Tears descending from unseen well
All the pleading is in vain
This terrifying voices are screaming for salvation
Therefor evil thoughts arise againâthey are hunting for us

Pointing at all of us
With limbs so cold
It is a charge
We cannot deny
What we have done, it is
A dream in black...
It is a dream inside

Dreams in splendid blackâthey seem to be our way
