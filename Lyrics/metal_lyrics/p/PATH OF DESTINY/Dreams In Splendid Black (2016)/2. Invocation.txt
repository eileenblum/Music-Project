Thou, spirit from behind the gates
My slave art thou in every way
No mercy, no escape
The wrath breeding within me
Is the force that drives your will
So I invoke you!

Strike against their walls
Burn down the bridges
And make them suffer
For their deeds
I invoke you!

[Chorus:]
Ritual of the inverted sign
Cleansing the planet in rage
Inauguration of the devastator
Ritual of the inverted sign
Cleansing the planet in rage
Sacrifice satanic forces rise

And soon the world shall be aflame
And mankind is a fading memory
The gods have left
The eclipse is at hand
Twilight ignited by the
Only one monarch of this universe
Follow your master's call!

This, the revenge taken
In blackest grimness with
Dark matter never to be fed up with days' light
It devours your kingdom!
And leaves no trace
Of an failing kind on this planetsâ¦ soil!
Of an failing kind on this soil

And now I call thee
To rise up, to appear
As a flame before me
As a flame to rage upon
These lands like a storm
Thy flames shall be the sword
Stabbed in their weak flesh
Summoning will take place
