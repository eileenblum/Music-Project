Exhausted beings hung to rot
Empty shells of shades I've seen them once alive
They seem to shape an empty alley
Into the vacant vastness of life

[Chorus:]
Mountains grinded and refined
A plane still lasts
Dead and hollow the place we used to love
Just ruins of the past remain here
And silent voices call for you out of the black
â¦and embers show you the way

Devastation reigned here
Made the heavens fall
Down on earth, on our world
Crumblingâ¦ Down
To the empires of lies
To wash them all away
For they are an evil plague

Decisions of the past
Turned out as a mistake
But we are not the same
Not aware of anything
Too much lies beneath the reach
Of our humble consciousness inside

Out of the black the fingers of sorrow
Grasp for my soul
To lay a little sickness around it
And transform myself into cinder
Glowing cinder
Evil cinder
Diabolicalâ¦

A reign of fire and thornsâfire and thorns
Vicious fire and thornsâfire and thorns
Demonic fire and thornsâfire and thorns
Diabolical fire and thornsâfire and thorns
