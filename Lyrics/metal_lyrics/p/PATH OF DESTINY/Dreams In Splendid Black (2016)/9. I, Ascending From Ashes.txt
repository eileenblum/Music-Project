Drowned in a fire
Of an astral kind
Devoured by flames
Sentenced to never find myself
Again in this deadly fog

Touched the great void behind
All that's of matter
I just see now how senseless
Me deeds and hopes were
But resistance grows in me
I'll be reborn much stronger than ever before

[Chorus:]
Against the unavoidableâagainst the law
Of the outer spaceâI will escape
Nothing will bring me downâabomination
I am ascending from ashesâand dust

I fight the void with
Thoughts of live
Of the future that I wanted to have
It twists under my mind's fist
Wants to hold the little rest of mine

The pure force of my will is
Still unbroken
And I will resurrect much stronger than before
No chains can hold me hereâforever

I am ascending from ashes
Ascending from ashes ascending from ashesâI am

My chains explode in shards
Broken by pure will
There is no higher sway than mine
My chains explode in shards
Broken by pure will
There is no higher sway than mine

Reborn much stronger than ever before!
