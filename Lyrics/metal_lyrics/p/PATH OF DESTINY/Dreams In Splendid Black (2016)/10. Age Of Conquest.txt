Free from the boundaries
Of voids' realm
I have become
Of blood and flesh again
This unknown sentiment of strength
My veins are filled with
Ecstasy!

A new body much
More alive than ever before
Forged in flames
Enlightened by the wisdom
Of the netherworld
Gazing upon this place
What is left out there?
No barriers and laws
Will hinder me
I going to wake the dead

[Chorus:]
For thou who sleep in stone and clay,
Hear this call, rise up and obey,
Treck on through the mortal door,
Assemble flesh once more
For thou who aren't immortal
Yet wake up from sleep and don't regret
What has been done and what will be
Welcome to my legion of the damned

Born anew and resurrected
Charging ahead into glorious times
A new age of gorgeous future
This is the conquest of mine

And a crown fits me
Wrested from the reaper's skull
As a sign of my victory
Over the forces of death

Age of conquestâunder the will of mine
Dark and sentencedâI'm the master of divine
Age of conquestâunder the will of mine
Dark and sentencedâI'm the master of divine
