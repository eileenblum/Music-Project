This is the sign for those
Waiting, all seeing
With wings spread wide
They ascend to strike again

Collecting the forsaken
Around the throne
Of voracity we're gathered
We'll build up an army
Against thy dominion
Of idleness we'll strike
And bring you to fall!

[Chorus:]
To reerrect chaos
And eliminate the thruth
No borders to live in between
Just a glance of madness
On the horizon of our lives
The Abyss yearns for you.

You! Thy ideas shall fall!
Thy world shall collapse!
And crumble to nothingness
The void will prevail!
The reign of the ravenous
A manifestation of a prophecy
That came to live
The reign of the ravenous
This is a prophecy that came to live

Legions of the unlight
Risen from the ashes of empires
That faded so long ago
Skeletal remains lusting for their realm
They light the torch of upheaval
A burning flameâ¦

â¦enlightening heavens with fear!
â¦at the edge of this world.

The reign of the ravenous
A manifestation of a prophecy
That came to live
