Eternal war is born
Innocent have to die
No one is behaved
Territory full of hate

Something has happened
As the dogs started to howl
The clouds are burning
Do you hear the voices call?

[Pre-chorus]
The mighty priest shall arise
Dragons fight by their sides
The sky is red - The dirt alive
A new line full of sacrifice

[Chorus]
The end [4x]

[Repeat pre-chorus]
[Repeat chorus]

Tortured souls are wandering forever
Seeking shelter - Seeking rest
Someone told you and you believed the words
Don't believe and don't believe

[Repeat first verse]
[Repeat second verse]
