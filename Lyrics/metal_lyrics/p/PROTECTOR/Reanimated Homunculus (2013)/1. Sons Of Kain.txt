The electric guitar with it's distorted sound
The thundering drums that are shaking the ground
The roaring bass that rumbles the brains
The growling vocals that enter the veins

Leather and vests, jeans and chains
From Ireland to Russia, from Sweden to Spain
The banner of Metal is always held high
Yesterday's sound and its servants are nigh

[Chorus]
Sons - sons of Kain
Our loyalty will never wane
Sons - sons of Kain
True defenders of the Metal domain

Embracing the old and despising the new
Eternally loyal, a true oldschool crew
The fire that drives us will never go out
Ruling the front row to bang and to shout

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat third verse]
[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat first verse]
