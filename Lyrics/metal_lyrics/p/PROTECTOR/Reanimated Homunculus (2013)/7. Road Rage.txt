The blood is pumping fast â The eyes are turning black
The dices have been cast â There's no way to turn back
Fists are clenched so hard â Waiting to break free
Someone has to pay â You just wait and see

[Chorus]
Road Rage [2x]

[Repeat first verse]

Now it's time for payback â Now it's time to strike
The brain feels like it's burning up â Time to jump the dike
Firing up the engine â The first stone has been thrown
But in the end you'll only feel tired and alone

[Repeat second verse]
[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat first verse]
[Repeat chorus]
