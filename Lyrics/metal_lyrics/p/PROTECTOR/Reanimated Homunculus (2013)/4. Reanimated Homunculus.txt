The candles are burning once again
A figure is formed by skillful hands
The rabbi is working day and night
Creating a protector, a guardian of the light

[Chorus]
Reanimated Homunculus
He has waited for centuries for our call
Reanimated Homunculus
He will return again to save us all

[Repeat first verse]
[Repeat chorus]

He's guarding the helpless, protecting the weak
Observing and looking out for those who pray and seek
And if he one day should again be gone
His body will have vanished but his spirit will live on

[Repeat chorus]
