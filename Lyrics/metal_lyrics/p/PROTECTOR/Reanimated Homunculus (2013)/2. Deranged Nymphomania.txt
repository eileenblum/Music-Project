A whip is cracking, a stick is whacking, nipples pierced with nails
A rope is strangling, a body's dangling, while the victim wails
Red hot pikes, a chain that strikes, the pleasure is intense
Perverted rites, day and night, no reason and no sense

[Chorus]
Nymphomania - 7 fists ain't enough
Nymphomania - 666 is the stuff
Nymphomania - 7 fists ain't enough
Nymphomania - 666 is the stuff

Gonnorhea and Syphilis
They don't stop an obsessive soul

An itching need, a sexual greed, for all that is extreme
To feel the pain, to hold the chain, is more than just a dream
To be a slave, until the grave, and a master 24 / 7
To ride the sky, with insane cries, that is their ultimate heaven

[Repeat chorus]
