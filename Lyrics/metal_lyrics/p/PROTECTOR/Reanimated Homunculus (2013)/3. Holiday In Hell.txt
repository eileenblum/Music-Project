Canoes going down the river into the unknown
Fear grips the soul at the five string terror tone
Don't expect anything to be the same again
There is no tomorrow, welcome to the monsters den

[Chorus]
Squeal like a pig
Squeal like a pig
They'll break you, like a twig
The inbreds do a jolly jig

[Repeat first verse]
[Repeat chorus]

The demons they are everywhere, waiting for their prey
Lurking in the forest hiding from the light of day
They are longing for someone, someone to kill slow
So stay in the shadows and hold tight to your bow

No one will survive
No one will be left alive
A slow death and lots of pain
This is where madness reigns

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat second verse]
[Repeat chorus]
