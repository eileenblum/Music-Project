Lost in a maze of infinite lanes
Darkness and fog are blurring the brains
Longa, Larga, Widmann, Venier
There's only one path that will lead out of here

[Chorus]
Calle Brutal, Calle Brutal
Calle Brutal
Calle Brutal, Calle Brutal
Calle, Brutal

Waiting for the ferry with Eric the Red
Taking a trip to the isle of the dead
Longa, Larga, Widmann, Venier
There's only one path that will lead out of here

[Repeat chorus]

Lieblicher Calle, Lieblicher Calle
Lieblicher Calle
Lieblicher Calle, Lieblicher Calle
Lieblicher Calle
