Follow the wolves on their way through the night
The moon is guiding the pack with its light

This is the land where the grey warriors rule
Join them, come, be a wolf not a tool

Rushing through forests and over the fields
Stand in their way and your fate will be sealed

[Chorus]
We are strong, we stand as one - Lycopolis
We are the dusk, we are the dawn - Lycopolis

In the southern part of the old river valley
Around the ancient castle, there they will rally

This is the land where the grey warriors rule
Join them, come be a wolf not a tool

Their cause is just - Their cause is fair
Lycopolis - Their eternal lair

On the castles roofs - Its towers and walls
Their growling and howling will fill the medieval halls

[Repeat chorus 2x]
