Flags and parades â Extatic screams
Millions of men, going to war
Honour awaits those who survive
A heroâs return â Nothing but dreams

A nation's dying in fire and ruins, the ruins of time
A nation's dying in fire and ruins, the ruins of time

[Repeat first verse]

A nation's dying in fire and ruins, the ruins of time
A nation's dying in fire and ruins, the ruins of time

Writing a new law - A strong and solid foundation
That tells the world about the birth of a free nation

Flags and parades â Yesterdays dreams
Millions of men died in the war
Despair awaits those who survive
The heroâs return in a black bodybag

A nation's born from fire and ruins, the ruins of time
A nation's born from fire and ruins, the ruins of time

Writing a new law - A strong and solid foundation
That tells the world about the birth of a free nation

[Repeat second verse]

A nation's born from fire and ruins, the ruins of time
A nation's born from fire and ruins, the ruins of time

Unity justice and freedom: the eternal truth
The lesson of a dark past - The birth of a nation
