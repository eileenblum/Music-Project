Zeta Minor antiparticle horror
Sucking the life out of any new explorer
Drained of life only corpses remain
Continuing until all intruders have waned

[Pre-chorus]
Perpetual energy
Something primeval
Disposal procedure
Planet of evil

[Chorus]
Antiman â Serving inhumanity
Antiman â Struggling with sanity
Antiman â The anti-matter fiend
Antiman â Soon the planet will be clean

Ponti and De Haan and good old Salamar
Molestrans, now dead, that caused the planets scars
Returning the samples a bargain has been made
The survivors can flee thank's to the clever trade

[Repeat pre-chorus]
[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat second verse]
