Mental malaria [2x]

Body functions are slowed down
Machines delay awareness
Their engineers don't figure out
To slow down your nightmares
The only cure is good sound sleep
And that just feeds the infection
You can't wake up in deep sleep
The machines obey their instruction

Mental Malaria

Dreadful pictures in your head
Through the dark you'll drive
Wake up fast before the dead
Machines rule your life
Dreams reflect experience
Running down this horror scene
Try to understand the sense
No one hears your fearful scream

Mental Malaria

Nightmares are a chronically
Recurring disease
Horror figures â Bad emotions
Buried in debrise
Repeat 1st verse!!!

Mental Malaria [2x]

Dreams reflect experience
Running down this horror scene
Try to understand the sense
No one hears your fearful scream
Sneaking when you're unprepared
Never try to dream again
Feel the things that make you scared
You'll survive when this dream ends

Mental Malaria [2x]
