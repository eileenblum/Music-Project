Past is the written history
Times been good and bad
Future is unknown and surely
We won't run things so bad

[Chorus:]
We don't know
Where to go
But who cares
No one dares

Great characters come and go
Fame of today lives hundred years long
His name returns   in grandpa's narration
He lives on his own creation

[Chorus]

Chronology...
Read the sign
Through the time
Art gets fine

Chronology...
Soon you'll be
Just like me
Never see...
Chronology...

Let's complete the ideas we have
Avoid the flow to consider success
Future is made by ourselves
Don't judge a try before it failed

[Chorus]

A valuable relic never dies
Forever it shines in our eyes
Things that occur in the past
Their place will forever last

[Chorus]
