Terror daily seen on the screen
Emotions lost â is it real or a dream
Neurosis drives the man insane
Sickness that we cannot blame
We are not entangled in
To think about it makes us no sin
Unknown victims that were killed
They don't need our full compassion

Hear screams out in the night
It must be another gun-fight

Been alone on the street again
On 5th Ave. there're standing 3 men
One man said: âHow is your trip?â
From now on I am in their grip
It's too hard for me to say âNo!â
So I said: âCome on! Let's go!â
Hear screams out in the night
It must be another gun-fight

Feeling like a ship on the stream
Sitting at home, what's happened on screen
On channel â3' is a fight with killer âTâ
Who survives lives for 20 hours free

Convicts on the street
Convicts on the street
Convicts on the street
Convicts on the street

Shoot by driving is the game that they play
Later that day I remember I was far away
The criminal movements shown on TV
This sad affair means nothing to me

Terror daily

[Repeat 1st verse]

Hear screams out in the night
It must be another gun-fight

Shoot by driving...
