Manipulation in the world
Is everywhere we go
We're influenced by religion
Commercial and TV
Laws made by minorities
To rule the world of hate
Oppressing the majorities
And lead them into fate

Hear
The rich ones laugh
Feel
What you can grasp
Smell
This decadence
Scream
Unconsciousness

Stand up and be like me
Let us fight this unseen enemy
Don't forget it's for ourselves
In this world exists no grace
[Repeat]
