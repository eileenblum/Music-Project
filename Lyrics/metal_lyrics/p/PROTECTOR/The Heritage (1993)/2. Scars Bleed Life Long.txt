Believe what you feel
And not what you see
The will imprisons emotion
A face is a mask
It changes so fast
Distinguish hope and frustration

Scars
Bleed life long
Bleed forever
Behind our eyes

The pain in our soul
Is omnipresent
In good times of life
We often repress
One side is crying
The otherone is laughing
In chasms of mind
Is lurking our wrath

Scars
Bleed life long
In oblivion
They grow strong

Scars bleed life long

[Repeat 2nd verse]

Scars
Bleed life long
In oblivion
They grow strong

In mental rain
Rusts sorrow and pain
We try to survive
To stay alive

Scars
Bleed life long
