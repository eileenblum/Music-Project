Sodom and Gommorrha - life's one big ecstacy
People with weak minds - will break down and fall
Never trust no one - twisted reality
Sex, drugs, music: wheel of life
Tired brains - depressions and suicide
Violation and crime - no one cares for nothing
Life must be lived - fast and ecstatic
Weak people die, or hide deep inside
A future not worth to live for
A world used, torn and finished
No hope for the poor
All power in the hands of few
Frigidity and aggression - "no love society"
Sexual perversion - animal experements
Zirrhosis of the liver - delirium tremens
Mental destruction - media controls
Nuclear fear - two minutes to dead end
Chaotic politics, senseless laws
Destroying the nature - dead trees / stinking water
Virulent campaigns - Mad world!

Only the strong survive

Only    - insanity everywhere
The     -  madness and drugs
Strong  - laziness, perversion, no future
Survive - the consequence of decadence

See the mirror of truth... You scream!
Can you stand the face of pain?
