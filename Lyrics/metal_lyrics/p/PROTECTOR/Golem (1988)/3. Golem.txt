Golem

Concentrated powers - mystical formulas
Seven burning candles - hexagonal star
An old and yellowed parchment - full of words and numbers
Limbs of dead material - start to move unsure
A mongolic face - muscles filled with life
A servant to the rabbi - immortality
Golem

Golem Humunculus
Golem Eternal life
Golem Unpredictable
Golem Obedient

Jewish myth - a friend
An old tale - protector
But sometimes - aggressive

Myth? True? Who knows?
He's working hard - not resting
But a berserk's inside him
Powerful appearance
But his eyes spread coldness

Myth? True? Who knows?
Myth? True? Who knows?

Feelings are not extant, weakness of the mortal
Golem doesn't care about human foolishness

Golem Humunculus
Golem Eternal life
Golem Unpredictable
Golem Obedient
