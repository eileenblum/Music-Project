The inside of a plane full of dirt and stench
Future warriors in dusty uniforms
Sent into this suicide by mad leaders
No one knows if he'll ever get back home
Here they go singing of tomorrow's pride

Our foe - No chance, No chance
We will win - Kill'em, Kill'em

Our foe - No chance, No chance
We will win - Kill'em, Kill'em

Sailing down with parachutes into the hell
Ruins, debris, ashes before their eyes
Robot-tanks are grinding stones into dust
Suddenly the hell breaks loose, the weapons bark
Soldiers running, falling, wallowing in pain
The robot-guns stop shooting, nothing more to kill

Mad operation - unscrupulous greed
Mad operation
The final aim: world domination
Uncontrolled lust for power
High - handed egotism
Struggle for immortality
A place - in history

Go! Go! Go! Go!

Go! Go! Go! Go!

One of the commandos has survived the fight
Crawling to the palace of the enemy
There it is the unprotected central station
Releasing the safety - catch of the atom grenades
He's shouting"Heil my leader", runs into the room
A deafening bang, the earth explodes, big surprise

The nuisance of the universe
The plague
Is finally gone forever.
