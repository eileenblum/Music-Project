Taking the crown from the lord of the hated reign
The fire burns behind his eyes - We'll overthrow the ruler
Of the seven castles of hell, but he isn't beaten yet
Because his guard of honour stands at his right side
The gates of hadesspit out their hordes to tame the land
They are prepared for the final battle
So be ready to fight
The dark knights ride into the row of rebel man
Blood and tears has to be spilled now for victory
The fight was desperate
And the stronger side had to win
Three days and nights they fought
And blood soaked the field

The gates of hades spit out their hordes to tame the land
They are prepared for the final battle
So be ready to fight
The dark knights ride into the row of rebel man
Blood and tears has to be spilled now for victory

The fight was desperate
And the stronger side had to win

Three days and nights they fought
And blood soaked the field

They took the crown from the lord of the hated reign
His guards are slain, his castle is burned to the ground
He stands alone, his fate is eternal isolation
He spreads out his wings and flies into an uncertain future.
