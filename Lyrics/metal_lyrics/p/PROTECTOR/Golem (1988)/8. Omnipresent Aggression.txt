Aggressive burning hate
Raging strong and wild
Never ending curse
Wrong or right, who knows?
"It comes creeping from nowhere!"
You say, but it isn't true
This rage comes from inside
From inside, that means you! 

Fire begins to flicker in the eyes
Hate grows faster and faster
Suddenly it breaks out
The aggression that's in your soul
Aggressive burning hate
Raging strong and wild
Never ending curse
Wrong or right, who knows?
The nature of man makes feelings rise
You feel the lust for blood - all aggression is shit! 
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

People start to act like maniacs
The madness will start now - why all this?
Searching for someone who's small and weak
Terrorize or kill him!...Satisfied? 

Aggressive burning hate
Raging strong and wild
Never ending curse
Wrong or right, who knows?

"It comes creeping from nowhere!"
You say, but it isn't true
This rage comes from inside
From inside, that means you! 

Fire begins to flicker in the eyes
Hate grows faster and faster
Suddenly it breaks out
The aggression that's in your soul 

Aggressive burning hate
Raging strong and wild
Never ending curse
Wrong or right, who knows?
We must stop such feelings
Thoughts and intentions
Or we sooner or later
Will end in misery
Some people beat their children
Some people torment their pet
Some people start a war
Are you free from hate?
Aggressive burning hate
Raging strong and wild
Never ending curse
Wrong or right, who knows?

Never ending curse!
