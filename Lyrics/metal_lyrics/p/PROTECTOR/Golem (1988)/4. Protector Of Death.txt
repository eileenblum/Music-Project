At the gate of hell he guards
Welcomes with a look so hard
His duty is to let you in
But not out, pay for your sins
When you're lying in your grave
He sees you coming, a futur slave
Belial is his only master
The one who brings the dark disaster
No one escapes from this place
The place of pain and of disgrace
His smile invites you to come near
And then you'll protect the evil
Stands on his post day and night
When the world is under Satan's darkness
He'll laugh again at the gods of light
