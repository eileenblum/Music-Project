Turning faces - an unreal rotating world
Slow movements - a fast and rumbling breath
Hairy spiders crawl up and down your veins
Hot winds - in the arctic night
Delirium tremens
Self destruction
One way of lost hope
Roaches creep out of your ears
Worse than your darkest fears
Coloured dots - block up the once so good sight
No pain - the body feel s numb and shakes
Fata Morgana - cars turn to cows and kids into apes
Delirium tremens
Self destruction
One way of lost hope
Funny visions - caressing the empty brain
Revelations - a new messiah has been born
The mountains break
The stones come down
A helpless feeling is gripping the halfeaten mind
Panic spreads
The brain commands
But it's attempts to rule the body is doomed to fail
Vomiting bile - now here it is the end of the road
Last breath - the upshot? 5:OO to death!
Storms howl - the truth is that there is no wind
Insane thoughts - what is realand what is phantasy?
