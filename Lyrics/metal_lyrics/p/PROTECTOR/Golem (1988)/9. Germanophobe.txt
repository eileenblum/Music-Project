The mankind always look for scapegoats
And we germans fit very good for that
Well our history is full of blood
But look at the history of other countries
No blood? No war? No killings? I don't see that!
Aggression, violence, invasions everewhere!
Corpses, ruins, killing - the world bleeds
Opression? A leader? Warplans? In our lands?
Freedom? Justice? Equality is what counts!
Please learn now, or believe what you want!
Disgusting smiles, defame - oh, so nice
If you don't know better? Please, shut up!
I am so damned sick of it! Wouldn't you be too?
You call us nazis - We're no fascists
We're germans - We're humans like you!
Let's free the earth from dictators
Genocide, murder, rasism - stop it!!!
Terror, injustice, fear must leave our planet
Let us build a new, better world
Nobody shall ever suffer again!
Never again!!!
