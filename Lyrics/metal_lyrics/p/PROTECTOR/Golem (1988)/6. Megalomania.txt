Fat, laughing pigs - eating and drinking
While others starve - go to hell, man
Talking senseless shit - to the neighbours at table
Farting anfd burping - tears in my eyes
"There'll be neither pain nor sorrow in my reign.
Follow my hallowed ways, into light and glory days!"
They're the politicians - do nothing than twaddle
They don't realize - that we're all in the same boat
I stop rowing now - than we'll see
Who's master who's servant - stinking bourgeosie
He will come back - burning and killing
You thoughthe were dead - and would never return
Euthanasia - total destruction
War without mercy - blood in your eyes
Megalomania
Megalomania
Megalomania
"I will rule for thousand years -
Ecstatic rites, bloodred tears
I slip into the politicians soul -
Control their minds, play my role."
Kommushism - dictatorship
Is it that - what you want?
You must learn - to be yourself
Don't let other - decide your fate.
