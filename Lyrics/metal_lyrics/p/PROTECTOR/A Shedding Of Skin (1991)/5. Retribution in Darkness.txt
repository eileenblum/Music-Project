[Music: M.Hasse and O.Wiebel / Lyrics: O.Wiebel]

As the moon begins to rise
Evil comes snatching out my eyes
Bloody dreams start to terrorize

[Chorus]
Retribution in darkness
Torn apart in my dreams
Retribution in darkness
Homicide in my sleep

Feeling for what can't be seen
Step by step my thoughts become obscene
Pleding for an end tonight
'til the evils returns my sight

[Repeat Chorus]

Feel the picture of sadness
Pull me to the edges of madness
Lost in a nocturnal abyss
Slave to our feelings of sadness

[Repeat Chorus]

Feeling for what can't be seen
Step by step my thoughts become obscene
Pleding for an end tonight
Till the evilness returns my sight

[Repeat Chorus]
