[Music: M.Hasse and O.Wiebel / Lyrics: O.Wiebel]

Tantalus son of Zeus
Wellwisher of immortal gods
Tried to exceed their immense wisdom
Invited them to an evil supper
Served his guests the slaughtered son
They recognized the malicious plan

Now - He's condemned to a life in
Hell - Got no chance to appeal for
Grace - Live and suffer forever in
Pain - To atone his stupid crime

Tortured with inhuman hunger
Feel the agony of starvation
Being alone with ripping spasms
Tantalus torment
You can't escape
Cruelest kind of torture
You will never die

Imprisoned by the flowing stream
Afraid inside to die of thirst
See the drink you cannot reach

Now - Suffer in
Hell - Without
Grace - Feel the
Pain - For your crime

Tantalus torment
You can't escape
Cruelest kind of torture
You will never die

Growing fear destroys the mind
Feel the boulder above the head
Thoughts go fast please make me dead

Now - He's condemned to live in
Hell - Got no chance to appeal for
Grace - Live and suffer forever in
Pain - To atone his stupid crime
