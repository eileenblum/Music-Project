[Music: M.Hasse and O.Wiebel / Lyrics: O.Wiebel]

Born into a world of sickness and hate
Ruined by the feelings of guilt and disgrace

Tortured through our wretched lives
Praying for our sacrifice
Screaming 'til we go insane
Shrouded in the grip of pain

Hoping for a lifetime that can't be obtained
In a world that teaches nothing but pain

[Repeat second verse]

A point of life for the shedding of skin
Strip away the garments of sin
We loose our flesh now our souls can win
Standing naked our lives begin

[Chorus]
A Shedding of skin (Repeat 3 times)

Through the pain we're forced to take
The outer shell begins to break
And in death our spirits rise
A new beginning to our lives

Dripping blood we're eaten by our leprosy
The jungle destroys us with evil we can't see

[Repeat fifth verse]
