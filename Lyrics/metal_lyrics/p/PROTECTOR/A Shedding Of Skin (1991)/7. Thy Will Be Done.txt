[Music: M.Hasse and O.Wiebel / Lyrics: M.Missy]

Helping hands
Guiding hands
Trust's a feeling warm as life itself
Masterplan
A leading man
All minds changed into one direction

Trumpets - Standards

A million eyes
Gearing eyes
Loud speeches roaring yet calm as prayers
Masterplan
A leading man
All minds changed into one direction

Power - Aggression

Thy will be done
Thy will be done

Masterplan
A leading man
All minds changed into one direction

Forward!
Attack!

Thy will be done
Thy will be done

Thousands die
Millions die
The end of yourself your own mistake

History - A spinning wheel

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
