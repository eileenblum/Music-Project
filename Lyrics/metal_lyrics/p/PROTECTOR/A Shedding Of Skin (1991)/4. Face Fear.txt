[Music: M.Hasse and O.Wiebel / Lyrics: M.Missy]

Night so full of eyes
So full of lies
Cold as a cemetery
Time of enemies
Feel
Misanthropy

Bells ringing in our ears
Walking all the fears
Which were long forgotten
Time of enemies
Feel
Agony

I can't face fear!

Not now! Not tomorrow! Never!
My saviour: a Latin name
Slowly the sun rises
At least in my tortured mind
I fly up, higher, to the sky for hours
Till pain brings me back

Back to reality

It was my own fault
The bad result
Of an experiment
Time of enemies
Feel
Misanthropy

Could time be turned back
back to the right track
I would return newborn
Time of enemies
Still
Feeling hope

Face Fear [Repeat 5 times]
