[Music: M.Hasse and O.Wiebel / Lyrics: O.Wiebel]

Your whole lifetime
Walking near the deadline
Think about your fate
Open mindlocked gates

The cruelty of nature
Enveloped death of creatures
Presence of birth and death
Require a bloody mess

Life is hard, you're dying fast
You can't oppose your destiny
Hands of time are passing by
How long can you live to die

Master - Glory
Servant - Shame

The existence of our earth
Is nothing to the universe
What you'll do and if you last
Is just puke in the dust
Death comes soon there's no doubt
Nothing to think so deep about

[Repeat second verse]

Life is hard, you're dying fast
You can't oppose your destiny
Hands of time are passing by
How long can you live to die
Try to live from day to day
You've got no other chance anyway
You should not lose your will to live
You've got a lot of things to give

Your whole lifetime
Walking in the deadline
Think about your fate
Open mindlocked gates

[Repeat second verse]
