Rotten world, empty words
Noone cares, decadence
You are blind, cause you can't see
That decadence surrounds you
You are blind, cause you can't see
The dying world around you
Luxury befogs the sight
Laziness paralyzes the brain
The papers lie about tomorrow
Believe or face the truth
On the street people die
Wars and hate passing by
You are so blind, cause you can't see
The greedy arm of profit
You are so blind, cause you can't see
The chains that hold you cown
Luxury befogs the sight
Laziness paralyzes the brain
Nice commercials dull the mind
But you don't care, cause you're so blind!
