You see what I mean with totally pain?
They're not worth to breathe the same air like us
Revenge! Crush the enemy
Kill them slow, burn the scum
The streets are filled with entrials
Take scalps and cocks as trophys
Love... Mercy... are just two vidiculous words
Show them your hate: disqust - abhorrence
Atrocities... What a world?
Realize the real warfare
You can't escape, we are everywhere
Wake up and see: a gun in your face
Stomp out their teeth, let it crack!
Rape their women, slay them
Let them drown in a sea of blood
Over and over again: no mercy!
You see what I mean, with totally pain?
They'll never breathe again the same air like us
Atrocities
