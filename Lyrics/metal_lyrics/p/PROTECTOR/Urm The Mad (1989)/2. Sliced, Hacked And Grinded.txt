Sliced, hacked and grinded
By a mortal undead
Chosen for dinner
Pay it all you sinner
Atomized cellular tissue
Death wants to kiss you
Life will leave your brain
Enjoy the bestial pain
Brutalized being
Lecherous watching tattlered guts
Hacked into thousand pieces
It's really a tittilating sight
Grinded genitals
Lovely stench of putresence
Desintegrated brain
Comminuted corpse
Sliced...
As the body is thrown into the cloaca
You know it was a sacrifice
To ssacrac, the Gods of gore
Still chewing with great relish
Stomped into the ground
You know it was a sacrifice
To ssacrac, the Gods of gore
You know it was a sacrifice
Sliced, hacked and grinded to the bone
