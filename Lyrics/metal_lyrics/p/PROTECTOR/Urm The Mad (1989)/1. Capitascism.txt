The sword beats to the left
And lets fascism grow
Hear the crowd scream" HAIL!"
And only few scream" NO!"
But when the brown weed has grown
And greedy reachs for the ultimate power
The millions will die again
In chambers with a gas shower
DVU NPD FAP crush them!
Neo-fascistic bastarg pack
We don't want you to rule
We don't want the old times back
Even if you scream and drool
You spit on our democracy
But you'll pay, wait and see
Our goverment does not really protect us
Well folks, then it is: God helps those who helps themselves
Capitascism is always the same
Destruction of the moral, that's your game
Capitascism perverted and extreme
Pinch yourself and realize this is no bad dream
Capitascism paid by the industry
Corrupt and avaricious, can't you see?
Capitascism there's only one solution
We will have to start a worldwide revolution
We will break the chains of rules
Kick the asses of our leaders
Untill they scream for justice
What justice?
