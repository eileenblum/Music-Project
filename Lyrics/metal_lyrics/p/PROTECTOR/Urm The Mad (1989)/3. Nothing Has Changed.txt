The buildings are made of gold
The sun shines bright
Out of a blue, a clear blue sky
The streets are clean
The people laugh
The animal are free
No hate - noone cries
No industry polluts the water
The sea is filled with movement and life
No more distrust
No more disgust
And no more war
Peace forevermore
The goverments scrap all the useless weapons
They are not bribale any longer
Everyone is happy
No more pain
But suddenly it's fading away
I wake up it's 12 o'clock
And I realize: NOTHING HAS CHANGED!
