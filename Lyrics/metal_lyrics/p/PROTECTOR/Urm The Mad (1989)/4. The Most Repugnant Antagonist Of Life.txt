Avarice around the world, in every town
You find these men, they sell you
The things you need
To be free, if you're insecure
You take them, and think you're free
But you're not, it's a halucination!
And afterwards, when the effect is gone
You will see it's all the same!
Why do you think, that you need these things?
What is wrong with you? Man, look at yourself
This shit slowly makes you daft
You live in the vacuum-world
Look into the future, is it really dark?
Don't be afraid of what will come
You have to learn to be your own master
Now, you have to learn to escape the desaster
Go, take the stape - give a shit
About friends who won't learn
Spit on it and let it be
You will feel much better, you'll see
Don't you feel that you're important too?
That you have people who love and care about you
Come, take the hand that reachs out for you
Turn your back to the drug, and be yourself!
