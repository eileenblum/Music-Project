You won't obey to anyone in this place where you don't belong
Your body and soul sing a song: Breathing Living
So many times your heart's been scorned
Your will and your faith ripped and torn
Now you are ready to reborn: Living Screaming
Emerging from a darkened world without a light without colour
You realize this was a curse. Screaming Fighting

Rise up and open your eyes and maybe you will find
The will to live again
Battle scarred, you try so hard to leave your demons behind

It's time to live again

Raging, yelling for salvation. You spit on their retribution
Will you succeed, will your soul burn? Sinking, crawling
A lonely world, we're living in. Fake innocence, you've always sinned
You're not ashamed, You have to bring you to life once more
