Frail memories passing by through my mind yet (they) fade away and die
Distant feelings scratch my soul. Today I'm breathing. No I didn't fall

But anger is still roaming. Like close friends we're walking. The moments we didn't share you and I

Frail memories passing by through my mind yet (they) fade away and die
Distant feelings scratch my soul. Today I'm fighting. I know I won't fall

For all the tears I didn't cry and all the pain I keep inside. The moments we didn't share you and I
For all the tears that I should cry. The pain that can't be kept inside
The moments forgotten by you and I

But anger is now raging: my best enemy, I need it. The moments forgotten by you and I

For all the tears I didn't cry, and all the pain I keep inside. The moments we didn't share you and I

Free from my scars, I can live on. We had our time under the sun
We won't meet again but in my dreams, we're not a 1000 minds away

There's nothing more to say but goodbye
