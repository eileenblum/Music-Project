Far in the east, in the ancient countries. Across the Jordan river, across the dead sea
Lied a land that men called Shinear. Long ago, in the ancient times
A jealous god, a ferocious one tried to kill his people by rain and flood

Nemrod the hunter: so was called the king of Noah's descendants
and these human beings were all living in one and only place
So they decided they would have to build a giant tower
for them all to live inside their creation for all eternity

Rise, Tower Rise to the skies and beyond Higher we climb reaching Up to YahvÃ©

For Once in human history: they united, they were brothers
Guided by a noble purpose: they united, they were brothers

But god feared that they'd reach the sky. The tower built with courage and heart
Nothing would have been impossible to them. Changed their language he divided them
Working together had come to an end. Only myth remains from the tower of Babel
