Just take a look at her: So fragile and so young
Lust is in your eyes, the devil's in your tongue
You can't refrain yourself From being pathetic
From being disgusting From being a piece of shit
Like the wolf you drool over your enslaved sheep
Of course you don't want to hurt her but you will
A victim you once were, this cannot be denied
But this is no excuse For child abuse

Into the void she will enter
To be safe and protect herself
To forget he's his own father
She knows love can heal and harm
For now pain she will find
Into the void she will enter
To find the love of a mother
To pray for her younger sister
She knows love can heal and harm
A bit of peace she'll find
Into the Void

She trusted you she loved you
How could she be wrong?
Now her life is twisted and she has to be strong
Mum didn't have a clue, or was it denial?
Both are guilty: Let's put them on trial
Become a woman now, a victim she once was
She is strong she won't fail
She's following the trail / way
That breaks the vicious circle of this wicked love
Of this monstrosity that leads...

Innocence replaced by guilt. She feels soiled
Her mind is bleeding - torn to pieces

Young girl has grown. She stands on her own
Her children well cared for
Future is bright, she stands on the light
She will no longer need the void
