Pray for God or be doomed
They want you to believe in / They wanna make you prey
Set you free from your sins and obey
They want to see you pray

Puppets forevermore with blinded eyes yet wide open
They think they aim for more but remain unheard
Brothers killing brothers
Sinners hating unbelievers
If hell exists in its flames we'll gonna burn
And they still pray

Gloria ! Gloria ! Fiat Voluntus Tua !

Feeding from hopeless souls
I keep them in my jaws
I'm the one I'm supposed to fight
Don't think trust me I'm always right
Scarecrows to control you
Let's be friends, let's kill too
For all, the real beast I AM

Women in fabric cell
They have to be slaves or be dead
Negate their rights, negate their lives no one cares
Neither man nor saviour

Soulmates with different gods
Love forbidden by these beliefs
Choose life, or love but both won't be for granted

Et delevit omnem substantiam, quae erat super terram, ab homine usque ad pecus,
tam reptile quam volucres coeli; et deleta sunt de terra:
remansit autem solus Noe, et qui cum eo erant in arca.
[Genesis 7:23]

We all need to believe in something to hold on
But words of peace that lead to war are nothing but wrong
Civilizations destroyed for the greater good
Genocides not forgotten and well understood
Humanity, open your eyes !
