For the song of the sea our children won't hear
For the one of the earth that's vanishing
For the song of the men that's just a whisper
Is the end just the beginning?

We think the world is ours
No respect for ourselves
Can't have it? Take it by force
Our own masters our own slaves
Let's be quick or be dead
No time to regret anything
Money and greed absolve our crimes
What's the point being a human being?

Men in black in ivory towers
feeding on black men's misery
Black gold in their homelands
Silver gains they'll never see
Population increasement
no one sees the fire in the basement
Faster ! We are crawling in the cement

We believed in the sun:
powerful ancient god we feared it
Then believed in the Christ or Allah:
the same kind of story
We believe in the world that we built,
while digging our own grave
Huge sword of Damocles. It will fall
no matter what we think

Frail lucidity
We sometimes deserve our humanity

Child soldiers increasing as fast
as wild animals endangered
But their risk of extinction
unlike polar bear's is close to none
Fukushima and Tchernobyl
Global Warming, tsunamis
A fucking frightening preview
Of this headlong disaster

We're late, so late
We are running out of time
Destroying ozone layer, Amazonia
We are the killing kind
We're fool, so fool
We are running out of our minds
Let's get ready for pain !
