In darkness I roam
My past life is gone
Now comes redemption

Gods have forsaken me
I've taken their lives
Beware the wrath of the bringer of hate/fate

Here I come

Punishment
For all of thee
This is my revenge

Beloved ones, my spirit's by your side

This is my vengeance

Beloved ones, my regrets never hide

My anger, my madness, my sadness

I'm here to stay, here to slay, here to make you my prey
You'll know the pain I endured
You'll have to pray, so you may live another day
Seeking revenge on Olympus
Enter the fray, face the ultimate enemy
Your reign has come to its end
At last I will live
