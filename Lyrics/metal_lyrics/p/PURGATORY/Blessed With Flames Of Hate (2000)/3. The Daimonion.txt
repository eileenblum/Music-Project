Leaded by a divine inside voice
Which shows me the way

A way which makes me to what I am
Possessed devilish and with the demand long for darkness
With words full of irony
Ill lead you in front of my eyes, your ignorance
And open the deepest abysses of your soul

Your flesh is worthless
And nothing of importance for me

I want your soul
To fill them with blasphemyÂ blasphemy

I am life
I am death
I am the voice  which cries in you for revenge
I am life
I am death
I am the voice  which cries in you for revenge

Which teach you rebellion
Against all forced upon laws

Daimonion -- the divine leading voice
Highest performance of living by instincts

Without and compromises
