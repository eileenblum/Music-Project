Breathless silent is the world
And over my soul crawls a shadow
The reality is poisoned by your lies
Infected by the sore of hypocrisy

Risen for the last fight
I call the horde of worms

To bring devastation and chaos
And to tug you in the pharynx of evil

In eternity the night is sinking
And icy storms develop their force
And the pain which live in my heart
Will gnaw on your souls

Under my feeds crack the winds of lifeless angels
And I hear fade away their cries in nothingness

Weak flesh slaved by light
Sinks in a sea of bloody tears

Blinded angels hem my way
And the melody of chaos fills the air

The delivery dead plays its song
And it's time to dance with the devil
