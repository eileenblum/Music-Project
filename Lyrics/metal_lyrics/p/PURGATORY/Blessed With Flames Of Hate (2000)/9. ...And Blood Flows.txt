Restless works my condemned mind
Through abysses of space and time
In visions I hear my name
And follow the call of darkness

Long awaited in my dreams now the time is near
Demons of my inside hell rise up

Long awaited in my dreams now the time is near
Demons of my inside hell rise up

Endless silence will be torn -- because of my cry
Endless silence will be torn -- because of my cry

Âand blood flows . and blood flows

In the depth of my heart grew the hate -- grew the hate
And its power drove me forwards
You are those who I despise -- despise
And my anger will be eat one's way into your soul
The seed of evil will be unleashed
And planted in your infected -- your infected brains

The day of insight is come
The day of insight is come - Âand blood flows from the altar
Blood flows -- blood flows
Blood flows -- blood flows
