Damned from the halls of godsAnd laid in chains of iron A deep fall from the lightInto the grounds of purest blackness Look up highTo the dark eternal heavenAnd to the mighty devilish moon Which froze your heart to iceBetrayed by your own brothersBecause they feared your might and power Condemned to a Martyrdom of endless torment Damned and betrayedDamned and betrayed Till the end of your existenceSlowly the chain cut your fleshDeep wounds let you bleed to deathThe oath for revenge gives power to break the chains
