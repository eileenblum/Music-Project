See through my eyes
Blood coloured visions of a dying earth
Black chaos winds storming
And bring us damnation

Visions beyond light
Visions beyond light

Rivers of rage forces one's way
And drown all life in the floods

Take my hand and I'll lead you
Straight ahead in the abyss

To show you where is
The origin of all grief

Feel with my heart
Can you see the approach darkness?

Which turn the day into eternal night

Feel with my heart
Can you see the approach darkness?

The death of sun
And with it the arise icy coldness
Which brings the killing frost
