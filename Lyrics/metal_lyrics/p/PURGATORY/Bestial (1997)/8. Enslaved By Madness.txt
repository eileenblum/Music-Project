Candles dark illuminate the room
Figures on knees wait for salvation
Words of lie resound through the room
To enslave the soul of these bastards

Prophecy of decline, despair and fear
Mutual escape, mutual dying

Miserably ceremony, mass suicide
Enslaved by madness

Wrapped in black, gowns, glassy look
Ready to drink the sweet wine of death

Miserably ceremony, mass suicide
Enslaved by madness

Full of expectation to sleep eternal sleep
Closed eyes, faces like masks, silence

The gates of eternity widely opened
The trip into nothingness has begun
