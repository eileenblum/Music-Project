Bloody-red the heaven change colour
Frightening quietness proclaims disaster
Shadows fall to the ground, distort the picture
Fear of darkness collects power

Bleeding eyes
Stare into nothingness
Behold â the horror

Dark shreds of clouds â envelop the awful grimace
The creature of revelation â has send its mob

And slowly the ruin crawls out of the pharynx of evil
Poisonous breath shows birth of night
And its claws open deep wounds

Blood wells like lava
And stirs up the greed of death
Silently the flames of hate bring ashes

Malignant spawn collects in the veins
Lives on the flesh of the damned

Malignant spawn collects the veins
Lives on the flesh of the damned
Born to begin a new time
Born to reign the kingdom of pain
