Longley awaited is the day, the day of revenge
Driven from faith in myself

I will be the messenger of death
Fear and scare I want to spread

I will bring decline and decay
Despair and prayers do not help
The executor is there â my sword
Will penetrate your poisoned flesh

And the sap of life
Will flow out of wounds
Expect no mercy
The end is hear

To fulfill the legacy is my aim
I under the banner of strength and power
I will walk like an evil shadow
I abhor your weakness, your lies

No right to eke
Out your existence
Near me
Immolation of the weak
