On knees he begs for salvation
Tears fall into the dust
Darkness wraps up the body
To weak to cry

Slave for spiteful dreams, slave for endless torment
Fear is bigger than pain
Grief which corrodes the brain
Unconsciously the body sinks to ground

Cold, damp stone catches it up
The whip of hate cuts deep wounds

Dazzled eyes by contraction of occur light
The certainty of last pain

Dazzled eyes by contraction of occur light
The certainty of last pain

The tormented flesh ready to die
The soul ready to escape
Eternal quiet surrounds the dead wrapping
Tormented flesh gets cold

On knees he begs for salvation
Tears fall into the dust
