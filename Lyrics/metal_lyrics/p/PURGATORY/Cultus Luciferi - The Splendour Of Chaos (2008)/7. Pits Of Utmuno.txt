[Morgoth Cover]

flames of hate - gates of love
the good decays when he arrives
halls of hate
slaughter, genocide
halls of death
my gory life
dungeons of misery
pits of utumno
death is approaching life
lifeless creatures come into existence
corporal death - emptiness inside
the undead will lead a distressing life
sacrilegious action, the dark side
contempt in death for humanity
ragged carcasses shred threads of life
the insane, cold blooded, march to die
obscure cycles of plinacy
fair hollowness screaming in their skulls
dusk falls while shadows are extending
darkness constructed - blasphemy of life
halls of hate
strength of madness
halls of death
no sense anymore
