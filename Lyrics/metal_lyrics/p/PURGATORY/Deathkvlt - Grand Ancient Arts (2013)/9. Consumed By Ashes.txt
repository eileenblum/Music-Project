Consumed by ashes
They lay buried
The lost souls of the burning centuries
Tragedy and war proclaims
The triumph of ghouls
Sent as a plague
From the abyssic ground

The crimson eye of the dark majesty
Watching silently above frozen plains
Of a desolated world
With a scornful smile
To observe the feeble screams
Of God's loved children
Trailing away in the cold depths of night
Or preachers of a dead lost kingdom

Ambassadors of a withering cross
Who shall ever hear
Now your last lies
In the mighty tunes
Of a bloody roaring war?
As never-ending shadows
Cover the earth with darkness
Cultures and religions will fall
Monuments lay in ruins

The bloodstained path
You have walked together
Through history
And cruel decades of terror
Will end here now
