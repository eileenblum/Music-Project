Let  my fires burn
To the dead serenades
Of howling wolves
In starless night

Let my banners fly
In a storm of thousand spears
Bringing doom upon
The frozen plains of God
And perishing the landscapes by blood

Onward to the burning shores

See my shadow rise
In cold and misty twilight
Over the burning shores
Which lay in war

See my visions grow
In the hearts of God's lost children
Condemned to live a life of suffering

Feel the taste of rotten love
All hope is lost, cold, dead, buried
I am the void of your miserable world

And I am onward to the burning shores
To the burning shores
