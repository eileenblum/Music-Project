Sick sleep, bed of thorns
Demonic shell breeds suffering into hate
Lying in wait within fires below
Sending darkness as a plague
To reap the faithridden above

Devoured by the drone of darkness
Divinity consumed in impure matter

As it ascends from the flames
Their prayers suffocate in torture
No salvation unto those
That walk the spheres of the damned

Oh grandur of flesh and bone
Coming ritual of vengeance
Evoken deathkult
Of grand ancient arts

When all flesh fails
Rivers be the veins of darkness
Landscapes swallowed by leprosy

Incantation of the purest black
Wretched souls pounding at hell's gate
The cult holds the key

Evoken deathkult
Of grand ancient arts
