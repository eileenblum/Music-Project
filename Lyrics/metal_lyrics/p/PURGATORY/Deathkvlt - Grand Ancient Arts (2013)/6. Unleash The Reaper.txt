Kneel down at the black cross
To hollow my grave
Dark blasphemic masses
Call me from beyond
Ceremony for the one who executes

I shall rise from my grave
To deliver the blade
You demanded by your hate
To kill those you once loved
Cut their throats
In the cold dead of night
In the cold dead of the night

Burning ritual candles
Enlighten diabolic eyes
Soaked the hands in the blood
Of those who brought you to me

Speak my name with fear
Tell my tale with awful shiver
Worship me - I lie in wait
Beneath my cross

Evoked dmon walking as a shadow
Seeking for sacrifices
To take their lives
With unmerciful hand
