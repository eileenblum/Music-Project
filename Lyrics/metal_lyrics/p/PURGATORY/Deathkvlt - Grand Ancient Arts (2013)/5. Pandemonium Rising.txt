Invoking the Gods
With lunatic verses of pathetic murmurs
...But why do they sleep in eternity
And cannot hear your voices?

Belief is a blain 
Surrounded by the greed of mankind
Unable to know that
Everything is worthless 
No divinity - consumed 
By darkness we are
Pandemonium Rising
Our world is hell and our home

No dignity - a race of rats 
Mankind is spreading like a plague
No ancient gods send words of mercy
Purifying flames 
Shall clean the earth

And the dark lord
Will rise from his throne 
Amongst conjuring madness
And you are the slaves at his feet

Burning temples fall into ruin
Holy symbols smashed in filth
Choirs of damnation 
Singing the serenade of weeping angels
Pandemonium Rising - at the final dawn
We all shall burn
