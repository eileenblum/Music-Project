What is the void?
...But the shape of zero
Astral unity cycle of being
Eternally we wander it's mystery

But underneath fathomless depths
Lies the secret's deepest secret
A truth eternally veiled
The father of here and beyond

From black into void I descent
Fading beyond celestial gates
Where unspeakable words
Gleam in the eyes of Yog-Sothoth

Hear me Nebula god!
Remove my eyes, strike me insane!
Guide me through death and darkness!
That I may vision the wisdom of the old!

What is the void?
...But two mirrors paralleled?
What cannot be seen or named
Is the portal of all powers creation

We must not halt in life
Nor faint in the presence of death
We shall walk the path of revelation
And bathe in the wells of chaos
