Possessed by dismal nightmare
A demon curses the flesh
Unholy psalms spoken
In screaming torture
Body mutilated in rites of infestation

In tongues of dead languages
Baal reveals his name
Worshipped god in Sodom
Leading the weak soul into his abyss

Burning excruciated flesh
A soul that will never find rest
Lays in the fever of demonic might
Soaked in the blood
That runs from your veins

A chaos is growing inside
Horrible pain
Causing the collapse of mind
Deadly claws cut through your skin
Grimace blessed with fear

Ruled by the god of the netherworld
Banished souls are calling his name
In psalms of invocation
Hail lord Baal - Curse the flesh
Of the weak
