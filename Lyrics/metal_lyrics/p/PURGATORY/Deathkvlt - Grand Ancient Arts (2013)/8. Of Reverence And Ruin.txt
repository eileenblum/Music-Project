In the corners where no light reaches in
We stood as one
In honour to the ancient gods
Condemning the laws of christ

Deviant to all who
Have led this world into ruin
False belief - False religion - False gods
As the keepers of the left hand path
You shall die by our swords
This world shall fall
Through the impulse of a host
Possessed by might and obsession
By a fatal idiot of God

Of reverence and ruin
This world shall fall
Of reverence and ruin
This world shall fall

It is the light which makes you blind
With every step closer to death
Led into ruin by their own holy love
This world is drowning in blood

As silent watchers we lead you into the abyss
Rising from the flaming seas
Laughing as the last grain
Runs through your fingers
You shall asphyxiate in your own filth

Of reverence and ruin
This world shall fall
Of reverence and ruin
This world shall fall

Ancient cults reborn
To hail the glorious dead
Who died in the darkest epoch of mankind
Bring vengeance to let them rot in the ashes
Of their fallen kingdoms
