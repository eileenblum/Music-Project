At the grave of the world
We stand as one
To embrace the final end
Of its tragedy
Entangled in a spiral of blasphemy
We worship the rising
Of a crimson moon
The gods lay in dark twilight
Astonished by their failure

Rituals of a burning moon
To absorb the stars and the light
Whispering voices of doom and desolation
Proclaim the loss of mankind

Howling winds of mourning
Came with the first stike of 
Human degradation
Like wolves we are raging
Through the night
Smelling tears of blood
That run from your eyes

Captured by fear
Everything falls into ruin
Prophecies of the crimson moon
Blessing your dreams of demise

Rituals of a burning moon
Into starless chaos we rise
Whispering voices of doom and destruction
Entwine the death of mankind
