Revocation of holy selfishness
The Day of Degradation has come

The Grandeur of Hypocrisy
Will suffocate in the Fire of Vengeance

Luciferic Conjure the Gate to the East
Luciferic The Enlightenment that you fear

We pick up the Banners of our Fathers
Swear Vengeance by our Blood
For all those who died under the Ethics of holy Church
We`ll bring the Failure into the Palace of God

A devouring Fire
Is destroying the bloody Legend
A Tyranny is ending
Don`t need a fucking God

Revocation of holy selfishness
The Day of Degradation has come

The Grandeur of Hypocrisy
Will suffocate in the Fire of Vengeance

It is the Black Realm in which we move
In a world where millions of fools are laying down their Faith
Into the Hands of the greatest Liar in the History of Mankind
Giving their trust in a Book every page is stained with Blood
The Truth is to dark to see
The Words to fierce to hear
But at the golden Dawn we all shall find Clearness
when we`ll be watching His Light
