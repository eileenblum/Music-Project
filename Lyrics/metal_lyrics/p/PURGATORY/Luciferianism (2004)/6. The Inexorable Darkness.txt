Darkness is calling you
To pay the price
Of your foolish existence

I am the sinner
The one without moral
Who denies your fucking cross

The inexorable darkness

An infamous killing
Crush the holy tyranny

Demon forces rising
From the underworld domain
Profane words let the walls break
Of the promised land

The altars burn
As high as the flames can reach

I am the sinner
The one without moral
Who denies your fucking cross
