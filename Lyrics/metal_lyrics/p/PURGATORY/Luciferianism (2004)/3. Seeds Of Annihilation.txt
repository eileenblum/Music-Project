Total Human Genocide
In Ages of Blood
Holocaust and Destruction
Is the only Law
The Gods of War strike back
And observe the World
With Terror

We all are blessed
By the Seeds of Annihilation

And the Flesh is damned from Earth
Human Race falls into it`s end
Apocalypse is marching forwards without Mercy full of Greed
At the final Pyre words of Christ
Eaten by the Flames

The following with Rapture
To blind and faceless Icons
It has come to end
By our killing Hands

Seeds of Annihilation

No holy Words can help us now
No God can heal your Wounds

No Light shines through the Darkness
No one hears the painful Cries

In the Seeds of Annihilation

This World sinks down in Terror
And His Blood rains from gloomy Skies

The Following with Rapture
To blind and faceless Icons
It has come to end
By our killing Hands
