A touch of pestilence
In fervent rotten eyes
Misery and death
Coming together with cold hands

The children bathe in their own blood
The grounds lay in a scent of sickness
Smothering life by the wrath of decay

Read in the eyes of the rotten
The history of an unavoidable genocide

The determined marching towards
The decline of humanity

Driven from conceptions of might
We're sinking in war

A touch of pestilence
In fervent rotten eyes
Misery and death
Coming together with cold hands
