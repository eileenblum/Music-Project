A life in desolation, remained in naivety
Criminal aberrancy, they rest among their ancestry
As an adolescent his life was filled with agony
Rancour put a tragic end to the affinity

His childhood and puberty were consisting
of maltreatment and abhorrent humiliations
His accumulating fury leading to an
unimaginable horrible escalation

Disposed of his relatives one by one
Convulsive twitch, morbid homicide
Increase of the dreadful phobia
Parental slaughter, infanticide

Parricide

Hatred actuated by the next of kin
The culprits of his painful education
The moment of judgement and punishment is there
Murderous massacre, obtruncation

Parricide

Sickened thoughts in his mind without repent
When he carries his mind to their fatal end
A reminiscence of death, disreputable history
Motive of retaliation, a revolting event
