Mutual aversion and disgust, religious facts
Fighting for the land on which they live
Separation of different races, different nations
Disparity, no solidarity

Deuce of a mess, impeachment of faith
Preachings, reconciliations insincere
Needless battles, die for the immortal one
Loyalty persuades, you'll persevere

Followers of false belief praise idolatry
Worship statues made of stone the adoration
Depiction of the gods in human shapes
Inhuman rituals, biblical transgression
A weapon in your right-hand, in your left a rosary
The polytheistic-monotheistic war
Believers of Almight prepare to die
Explain to me, what are you fighting for ?

Shrouds of smoke, moonsoonclouds in the sky
Temples and crucifix' on fire
Malevolent rage in distressed areas
Admission of true faith is their desire

Riots and slaughter, mortification of the dead
Victimize the ones you despise
Breathing smother of pyromaniac conflagrations
Obstructed respiration, affected eyes

Commandments
Clerical orders
Combative perjurers
Convinced in their right

Commandments
Eternal tenacity
Abusing obedience
Unreal motive to kill !
