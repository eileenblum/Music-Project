In an age of death and fear
They were frightened of sunset
Detest the dark when possessed ones appear
Disturbing the peace of the dead

A deterrent tale of reality
A story made of fantasy
Searching for truth, philosophy
Superstitiousness, wittingly

I believe in the resurrection
The return of dead on earth
Black magic and supernaturalism
The phenomenon of death and birth
I believe in the reincarnation
Another life, another existence
Returning in a transformation
In a time in the far distance

Looking in those eyes
Death was instantaneous
Insignificant skies
Incantation, unconscious

They have died a suspicious death
Kindle the fires around their graves
The curse is now to be said
To prevent becoming his slaves

Created by the insanity of humanity
Executed by scepticism and irresolution
Uncertain sureness caused by deficiency
Unprovable reality of the degeneration
