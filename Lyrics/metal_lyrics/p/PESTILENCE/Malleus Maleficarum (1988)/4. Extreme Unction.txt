Passed the door of death
Hereafter place to be
Fortified with the rites
Clerical loyalty

Final means of grace
Time has taken your life away
Cadaverous corporal constitution
Future lies in decay

Extreme unction
Sacrament of death
Mortality destiny
Inevitable in humanity

Funeral oration
Mourning for the dead
Gone away, left for
Another life instead
Procession is passing by
Flowing tears of grief
Let us pray for the dead
Hold on to your belief
