["An unknown dimension revealed to man"]

Within the realms unseen
The missing have returned
Deformed beyond recognition
Remains of bodies burned

When all is lost
Swallowed by depths of darkness
The gates to the kingdom of horrors
You've passed, now dwell in madness

Flames of eternity
Burn in immortality
Skin melts so horribly
Revealed surreality

Breathing blackened air
Within the walls of gore
Behold the view of disgust
The secrecies of horror

Eyes of fear, torture is near
Tearful cries, you hear

Discovering beyond death
Secrets you will find
The horror you'll meet
Will capture your mind

Secrecies of horror
Secrecies of horror
