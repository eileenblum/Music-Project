["Ancient wisdom in present reality"]

Philosophy of time
The knowledge of the unknown
Ages in which the future was seen
Visions of hell were shown
Nightmares foretell the unexpected
Gifts from the human minds
Mysterious spells, the art of magic
Obsessions of a frightened kind

Apocalyptic fears
Of the course this domain will take
Ancient insanity
Self-destruction we create

Gaze into a blackened void
In search of what you will see
The emptiness surrounding you
Reveals you the things that will be
Dominate the mystic powers
Through darkened skies they rise
Eyes behold the past and future
Where damnation lies

Revelation
Revelation

REVELATION!

Immortal ones watch chaos prevail
Decades of darkness will come
Taking over the lives on earth
There will be none
Truth for the quest
Not to reach by the mind of men
Prophecies for a dying race
Fear of the predictions from then

Revelation
Revelation

Burn!
Burn!
Burn! Burn!
