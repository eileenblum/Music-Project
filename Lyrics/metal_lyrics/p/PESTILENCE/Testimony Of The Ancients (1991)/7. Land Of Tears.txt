["Fear of all evil that controls mankind"]

Dark sides of life
Unspoken by those in search of the light
Darkness they will find
Rejecting all evil, taken possession of mankind

Fighting what can't be fought
Minds penetrated, souls will be taken
Days turn into night
Bodies are falling, hear death calling

Throughout the centuries
Attempts for protection, prayers, religion
Signs make you aware
Of it's mass domination, a divine dispensation

Land of tears

Indulge in the tempation
Your mind will show you the way
Ghosts of the damned will guard you
In this journey into decay

Land of tears
Land of tears
