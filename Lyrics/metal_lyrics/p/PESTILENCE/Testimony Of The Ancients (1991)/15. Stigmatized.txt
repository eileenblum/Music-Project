["Branded, for making the wrong choices in life"]

Open the book of life
To die a second death
Burn in the lake of fire
Next to the false prophet
Face the thrones of judgement
Decide who lives who dies
Glorify the priests of unholyness
Bring forth your lies
Die in your sin, weakling
End in sight by his might

No power over the sacred ones
Kings of a thousand years
Heavenly fires waste those
Who failed to see or hear
The words as old as time
Written and foretold
Marked will be their bodies
Their souls they have sold

There's no mercy, save me
From this purgatory

Stigmatized
Stigmatized
