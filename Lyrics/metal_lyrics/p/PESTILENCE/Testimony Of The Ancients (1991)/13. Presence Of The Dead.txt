["Seances to summon (and communicate with) the dead"]

Welcome to the realm of the dead
Back to where they wish to be
Messages from another life
No death lasts for eternity

Practicers of the sacred science
Seek the shapeless company
To reveal the secrets hidden in
Dimensions we cannot see... we cannot see

A language unheard before
Undead voices, explore
The treshold of death, I have met
The presence of the dead

You claim to have seen my destiny
So tell me what it is gonna be
Mislead my desire
All evil you admire... Liar! Liar!

Unconsciousness, take me to these
Places undreamt of awake
Face the mysteries
Manifestations of the deceased initiate... initiate

Hear me, I summon thee
From where all souls conspire
Speak and appear before me
Tell me my deepest desire
