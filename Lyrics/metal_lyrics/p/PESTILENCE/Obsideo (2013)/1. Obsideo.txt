Flat line, the gruesome possession,
the pounding of negative energy,
the astral body is ripped from the obsession,
to merge with the infinity.

Besieged with the negative,
no longer safe from the spirit world.

The lower layers of the real,
is infested with the liar,
anti organic entities feel
weak emotional scars to enter with fire.

Loosing all human perspective,
the ego conscious is swirled.

The haunting of the flesh,
to dissolve the soul they strive,
and jealously detest,
the dimension that is earthly life.
