The virgin soul no longer white,
shining devious through the skin,
the body's aura losing it's bright,
mental projection of the sin.

[Solo Mameli]

The sicker the body and soul,
the more negative the aura gets,
blacker than the blackest coal,
revealing the negative that affects.

The aura cannot lie and hide,
this true entity that is so grim,
egoism overshadows all pride,
chance of mental recovery is slim.

The sicker the body and soul,
the more negative the aura gets,
blacker than the blackest coal,
revealing the negative that affects.

Ego no longer separated from lies,
so the conscious cannot see,
the truth is smothered and dies,
trapped in structure and no longer free.

[Solo Uterwijk]
