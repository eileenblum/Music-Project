Clear voidance in a lucid state of mind,
no need for eyes just intuition,
leaving all earthly worries behind,
systematic patterns create the decision.

Pain of a thousand life's are now one,
mental journey to the inner core,
physical pain long time gone,
non existence after and before.

Connecting to the all knowing source,
information of all mysteries revealed,
a fraction of eternity births your course,
faith of a next life is sealed.

[Solo Uterwijk]

[Solo Mameli]

The purpose of existence falls into place,
to live in sickness and in death,
to die useless and fall from grace,
and suffer the healing from regrets.

Pain of a thousand life's are now one,
mental journey to the inner core,
physical pain long time gone,
non existence after and before.
