Mangled and ripped from existence,
gateway to the unknown compels,
maintaining the ego is subsistence,
spirit guides restrain the soul to dwell.

Escaping destiny is not an option,
to face your reincarnations and fear,
tearing the layers for absorption,
salvation from denial is more than near.

The physical nightmare has begun,
separation of the flesh and the soul,
the mind cannot cope and goes into a mental stun,
before acceptable to achieves the astral goal.

Laniatus-ripping the soul from the flesh.

Escaping destiny is not an option,
to face your reincarnations and fear,
tearing the layers for absorption,
salvation from denial is more than near.

Mangled and ripped from existence,
gateway to the unknown compels,
maintaining the ego is subsistence,
spirit guides restrain the soul to dwell.
