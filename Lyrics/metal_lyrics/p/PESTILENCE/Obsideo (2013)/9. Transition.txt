Letting go past emotions and embracing the new,
the easier it gets to detach from our loved ones,
this natural evolution disrupts for but a few,
hooked on the earthly shall make you not gone.

The realization that body and soul can be separated,
will make one understand the true nature of reality.

We are not just flesh but more than that incorporated.

The realization that body and soul can be separated,
will make one understand the true nature of reality.

We are not just flesh but more than that incorporated.

Transitionâletting go and leaving behind.
Transitionâevolving into the next kind.

Transitionâletting go and leaving behind.
Transitionâevolving into the next kind.
