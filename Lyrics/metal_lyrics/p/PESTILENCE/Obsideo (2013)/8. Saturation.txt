Flooded with the energy of a thousand souls,
chaos merging with the timeless,
the all knowing controls,
the infestation of the heartless.

Blackened entities merge with the already fallen,
as the catastrophic scenario unfolds.

[Solo Mameli]

Hopelessly trapped inside the multiple sphere,
all reincarnations are now one,
becoming multiple beings,
full of fear.

Blackened entities merge with the already fallen,
as the catastrophic scenario unfolds.

[Solo Uterwijk]

The never ending stream of the sick,
drenched and saturated with hate,
overshadows natural transitions that are basic,
fucking up the holy just to complicate.
