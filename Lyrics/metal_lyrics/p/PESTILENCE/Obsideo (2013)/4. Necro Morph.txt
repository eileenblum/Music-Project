The test of time already lost,
Once reborn destined to morph,
Trying to live at all cost,
Death is eminent to absorb.

The transition to the all is inevitable,
Living death as we breathe,
Mind's capacity makes it comfortable,
Suppressing the horrors underneath.

Just let go the feeling of helplessness,
Can't do shit about this pure sickness,
That is called life.

This sick and tragic life,
It will soon be realized. 

Necromorph.
