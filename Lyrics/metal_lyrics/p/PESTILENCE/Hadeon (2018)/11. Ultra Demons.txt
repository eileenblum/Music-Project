Inside your weakness lies their strength
Any doubts is felt as an entrance to your soul
A gateways through the human wavelength
Thus enters inside the ultra demons to control

No longer able to resist what's already deep inside
The absolute truth about the human essence
Egoism, the imbalance you can no longer hide
Slowly infesting he mind

Total chaos in my head
Existing at 1 kHz
Extraction of the human soul
Leaving you blackened like coal

Once inside they anchor themselves on all sub-levels
Mimicking reality to where you cannot see
Soulless beings rendered as powerless vessels
Manifestations of the maladies roaming now free

Questionable behaviour analyzed by the external
Timeless beings now manipulating the eternal

[Solo: Dobles]

Pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath
Pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, sloth

[Solo: Mameli]

Total chaos in my head
Existing at 1 kHz
Extraction of the human soul
Leaving you blackened like coal

Pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath

Ultra demons
