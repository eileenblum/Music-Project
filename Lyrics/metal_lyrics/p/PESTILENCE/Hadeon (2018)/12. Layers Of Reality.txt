What you can see you take as reality
That's how weak and feeble you are
The truth does not lie within your memory
It misses the target by a far
There is no way of finding it in just one place
Multiple layer of consciousness
Multiple truths in this maze
The mind builds self confidence

Windows full of deceit
Tell you what you need
Whatever your looking for
Feeding the ego to explore

Layers

[Solo: Dobles]

What the primitive mind just cannot understand
Is that all there is exists in the now
Layers are masked with the implant
To cloth and to disavow

Windows full of deceit
Tell you what you need
Whatever your looking for
Feeding the ego to explore

Layers of reality

[Solo: Mameli]

The universal laws of good and evil stays intact
For deep inside the core you just know
That negativity feeds the parasites that are also trapped
Feeding on ego weakness, wanting your precious soul
Seduced by lies and the absolute deception
Where you lost all direction in finding your path
Using all means for the deflection
Consumed by psycho vampires through their wrath

Layers of reality
