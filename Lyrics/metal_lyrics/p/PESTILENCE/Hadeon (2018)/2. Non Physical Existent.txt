When one cannot see it
It doesn't mean it is not there
Of this cold and morbid truth,
Only just then one can see
What you have been scared of since youth

Because there is no heaven and
And that there is no hell
Only the blackest void,
In which the human soul shall dwell

Non physical existent

Forever and ever is only a matter of time
Where the human mind and soul
Has to deal with the laws of nature
Trapped in this eternal wormhole
There are many sub frequencies
That want to get inside your mind
The only goal is to absorb you
Put you into their emotional grind

Because there is no heaven and
And that there is no hell
Only the blackest void,
In which the human soul shall dwell

Their only goal is to distract you
From getting the eternal peace
To take all your energy
Like a cancerous disease

[Solo: Mameli]

Beware of the non physical exists
Because they will eat your light
They exist in the unholy
Where the all black rule this fight
When one cannot see it
It doesn't mean it is not there
The physical realm is a perceptions
The one reality of which you are aware

Because there is no heaven and
And that there is no hell
Only the blackest void,
In which the human soul shall dwell

[Solo: Dobles]

Existent!
