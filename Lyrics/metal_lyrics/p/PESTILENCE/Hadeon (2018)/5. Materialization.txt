Once they can find a way to get inside your mind
This external terror can'take it's form
If you will give in to a sickness of this kind
It only takes full exposure to set the norm

Within the realms
Of the neurons they can infest
These parasites will consume
Leaving your body fully stressed

Materialized

[Solo: Dobles]

Only the feeble and weakest of soul
That depends on a set structure of belief
Victimised by the negative that want control
You will never again feel peace and relief

Within the realms
Of the neurons they can infest
These parasites will consume
Leaving your body fully stressed

Materialized

[Solo: Mameli]
