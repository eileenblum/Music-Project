Different planes of existence
The frequency of that dimension
Wormholes, unlimited distance
The all and it's constant expansion
The consciousness that resonates
With unlimited power to be
Genetic code can re-create
A reality within a reality

I am the gateway
Between the macrocosm
I am the gateway
Between the microcosm

Multi dimensional

The astral body now can't withstand
The psychic turbulence
Using the whole broadband
Infected with the pestilence
True-self can becomes lost
In our unconscious mind
When the ultra demons exhaust
The ability to make one blind

Fear and negative emotions
Are caused by malicious entities
Mentally disrupting Trojans
Will do anything to make you not see
For consciousness that resonates
With unlimited power to be
Genetic code that re-create
A reality within a reality

I am the gateway
Between the macrocosm
I am the gateway
Between the microcosm
