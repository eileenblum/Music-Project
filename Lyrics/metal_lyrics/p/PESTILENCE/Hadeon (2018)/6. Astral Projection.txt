Astral flight â through space and time
Faster than light â imaginary might
You will soon realise â that life just a lie
That we really cannot die â and there are no goodbye's

Mental spaceships faster than the speed of light
Takes you to either heaven or an evil twilight
Using the almighty wormholes of the All
Nothing but thoughts to direct this free fall

The energy that is our souls transcends body and flesh
Use these power wisely or your mind will certainly crash
Don't get distracted or this phenomenon will claim
The eternal soul cannot die but surely can be maimed

Particles of the whole you will self-construct
Stability comes from positive energy if well instruct
Denser than a black hole you will be able to pass
Since the astral body has no more mass, no mass

Passing through eons of time all at once
If we would understand this we could flourish in abundance
Since there is no such thing as time future and the past
All is happening simultaneously, so acceptâ¦

Astral flight â through space and time
Faster than light â imaginary might
You will soon realise â that life just a lie
That we really cannot die â and there are no goodbyes

Astral flight â through space and time
Faster than light â imaginary might
You will soon realise â that life just a lie
That we really cannot die â and there are no goodbye's
