Holographic self image of reality
The existence and nature of the human soul
One indivisible totality
It is for you to control

Course of evolution
And full reincarnation
Tendency of identification
Given to you by creation

We live in division, in parts, in particles
Equally related to the eternal one
To overcome distracting obstacles
To become bright like the sun

Course of evolution
And full reincarnation
Tendency of identification
Given to you

Oversoul

[Solo: Dobles]
[Solo: Mameli]

The subject and the object, are one
This deep power in which we exist
What one cannot see doesn't mean it's gone
Within ourselves we cannot desist

Course of evolution
And reincarnation
Tendency of identification
Given to you by creation
