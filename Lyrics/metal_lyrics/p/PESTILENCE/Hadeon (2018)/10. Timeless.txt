In a time when there was no time
Reality was made of thoughts
Where time and space was defined
By aligning stars as dots
When the ancient ones ruled the astral planes
Planting the seeds of doubt
The earliest thoughts as little as grains
For weak receptors to be cast out

We are the timeless
We exist in brightness
We are the body-less
We are ageless

For it has been and will always be
The rules of physical and non physical
Even with eyes shut you will see
But for some these rules are too cryptical
These thoughts are older than time
They make up space and reality
There is no beginning or end to this grime
The positive and the negative ruled by the lordly

We are the timeless
We exist in brightness
We are the body-less
We are ageless

[Solo: Dobles]

Makers of reality
Creators of the void
Dictators of the astral sea
Taker of the endless spheroid

[Solo: Mameli]

We are the timeless
We exist in brightness
We are the body-less
We are ageless
