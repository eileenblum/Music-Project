Once a God, once left to die
The desert punishes relentless
Daytime sun makes your brain fry
At night, the cold freezes your merciless

Outcasted by the ones who once loved
Worshiped until death do us part

[Chorus:]
Dehydrated

The young God has been put to rest
Drained of all his life fluids
Embalmed body to maintain
Structure to rise up once more

The wrath and hate of a 1000 years
Resurrects me to conquer once more
Bringing PESTILENCE to annihilate
The guilty ones in bloody gore

Outcasted by the ones who once loved
Worshiped until death do us part

[Chorus]

Feed me once more with your lies
Kiss and worship the floor I walk on
I will forget no more the pain when someone dies
For it was me who was dead and gone
