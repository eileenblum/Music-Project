Devouring Frenzy

Insatiable lust to consume
To fill the emptiness inside
Desolated like living in a tomb
Detached from life inside

Self image - So distorted
Blind - What is real?
Devour - Emotions aborted
Fading - Until nothing you feel

Devour

Vomiting the ugly truth out of you
To detest one self makes the cycle complete
Mutilated thoughts make true not true
Reality returns again you must feed

[2nd verse]

Devour
