[Chorus:]
Neuro
Dissonance

Trapped in oneself
Neuro signals distorted
To become a hazard to yourself
Mental thoughts aborted
Emotional disruptance
Slice my flesh up to maim
Suppressed by medication, help me
Dreaming the dead in lucidity

[Chorus]

Thought patterns in an illogical trail
Are scanned with human technology
Unraveling the secrets and details
Of the horror that's inside of me

Abnormalities rejected as just not true
Refusing to accept the truth lies in you
Function of the cortex detaches reality
Altered state of consciousness now you see
Overload of signals in the synapsis
The dissonance takes over all emotions
Now seeing humans for the monsters they are

[Chorus]

Trapped in oneself
Neuro signals distorted
To become a hazard to yourself
Mental thoughts aborted
