[re-recorded bonus track]
[Originally in the album "Consuming Impulse"]
[Music: Mameli, Lyrics: Foddis]

In the darkness
They crawl on places
Where you can't see or hear them come
Marching silently
When it's dawn they will be gone

A swelling on my body
Makes me suffer, live in anxiety
No time to waste
Just open the abscess, will you please help me?
The ignorance is dominating
Remedies you try
I can not live this life any longer
What is it and why?

While you're asleep
They'll enter your skin
The search for a new place where they will dwell
They give their children
A place to be born
You won't notice except for the smell

Mysteriousness, researchers can't explain
The sorrow of this internal pain
It's burning stronger day by day
Cure me, there must be a way

Desperation, confused mind
Never heard of a disease of this kind
So tell me what can I do
To leave this Hell I'm going through

[Solo]

Human blood the perfect place
Birth of descendants
Creatures living
In my veins, the horror
Frightening, sickening
The pain that I am bearing
Begging, please get them
out of my body

[Solo]

In the darkness
They crawl on places
Where you can't see or hear them come
Marching silently
When it's dawn they will be gone

Human blood
The perfect place
Birth of descendants
Creatures living
In my veins, the horror
Frightening, sickening
The pain that I am bearing
Begging, please get them
Out of my body
