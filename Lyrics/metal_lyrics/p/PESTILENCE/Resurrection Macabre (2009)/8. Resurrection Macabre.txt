Resurrected to rot once more
Devouring the all organic whore
Pulsating urge through hate neurons
Black veins, weakened souls absorbing energy

Stretching the horror absurd
Living tissue stripped from reality
Regurgitation of hate dissolving organic
Until pure

[Chorus:]
Resurrection Macabre

Intestinal beads trophy religious like
Love to hate and hate to love
Grim reality, life seaps away
Compulsive suppressing emotions of weakness

Stretching the horror absurd
Living tissue stripped from reality
Regurgitation of hate dissolving organic
Until pure

Stretching the horror absurd
Living tissue stripped from reality
Regurgitation of hate dissolving organic
Until pure

[Chorus]
