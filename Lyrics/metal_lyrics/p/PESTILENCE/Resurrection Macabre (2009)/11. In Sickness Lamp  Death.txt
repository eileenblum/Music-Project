The sick become now the dead
Breaking out of the boundaries
Leaving all behind with or without regrets
Spawning out as new entities

The ones left behind mourn their loss
Not wanting to let go but the corpse
Can't stand the test of time and decomposes

Excruciating grief and pain of the heart
Years of agony and living in sorrow
Can't live without you, worlds apart
I feel so hollow

Freezing cold - Preserves the carcass

Freezing cold preserves the carcass
Of the person you once loved
The past in your mind you rehash
The proof of existence's residue

Freezing cold - Preserves the carcass

In Sickness and Death

The sick become now the dead
Breaking out of the boundaries
Leaving all behind with or without regrets
Spawning out as new entities

Residue

Freezing cold - Preserves the carcass

In Sickness and Death
