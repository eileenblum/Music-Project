[Chorus:]
Hang
Hangman

Mind is set to the unexplainable
As cries of fear fade away
The living end up dead, disposable
Asphyxiation, motionless they lay

[Chorus]

This feeling of emptiness inside
replacing compassion
With emotional void I hide
to cover up my expression

The cracking of the spine
And the breaking of the neck
The rope tightens through the hands of mine
Compassion is what I lack

[Chorus]
