This is the year to hate
To be consumed by the eternal fire
Rise up for reconciliation too late
Bury the truth it's time for the liar

I see you - For what you are
I see you - All consuming
I see you - We came this far
I see you - Death is blooming

Year to Hate

Peace now belongs to the past
Global transformation into the world of tears
Plague of hate for a year to last
Roam free and load up your gear

I see you - For what you are
I see you - All consuming
I see you - We came this far
I see you - Death is blooming

Y2H

Negativity now makes us blind
As we destroy all that is known to mankind
Feeding on hate and greed, we lust
For our ego's to expand, no one we trust

I see you - For what you are
I see you - All consuming
I see you - We came this far
I see you - Death is blooming
