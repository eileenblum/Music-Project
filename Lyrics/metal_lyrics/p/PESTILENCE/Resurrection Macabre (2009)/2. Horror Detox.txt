[Chorus:]
Horror
Detox

The agony and pain
To have to let go
The cold reality
Of not being in control

The body starts to tremble
The breaking of the will
Addiction now is the enemy
Makes you want to kill

Despair now takes over
Crawling on the floor
I need something to ease the pain
Demons in my head roar

[Chorus]

Help me with my suicidal urge
Distortions in my head
My soul that is now burning
Kill me, I want to be dead

[Chorus]

This trembling makes me go insane
I need to make it stop as I carve my skin
Numb this horrible feeling my aim
Please erase the person I have been

[2nd verse]
