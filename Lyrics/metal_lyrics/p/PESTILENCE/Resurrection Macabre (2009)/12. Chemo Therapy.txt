[re-recorded bonus track]
[Originally in the album "Malleus Maleficarum"]

Practicing usury cancer
Bifurcation of the tumor
Unstoppable swelling
Cellular tissue consumer

Desperately searching for a solution
Against the deadly life corrosion
Countless medical examinations
Lead you to self-immolation

Chemo-therapy
Chemo-therapy

Undergo of radiation
Diatribe of your hair
Monitors, X-rays, injections
Consequences you have to bear
Skin is turning black
Forced to take liquid food
Vexations are you share
Even loss of manhood

The only possible solution
Against the deadly life corrosion
Were these medical examinations
That make you die of radiation!
