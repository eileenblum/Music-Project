Mutilated thoughts of reality
Systematic instruction of what to be
The cleansing of the soul - Baptized in Blood
Immortality given by my god not your god

[Bridge:]
Emotions controlled
It's the bringer of the death kiss

[Chorus:]
Hate Suicide
Can you see the fire burning in my eyes
Hate Suicide
This is the moment innocence dies
Hate Suicide
Can you see the fire burning in my eyes
Hate Suicide

Emotions controlled
Bringer of the death kiss
To disrupt and maim of all that is
Raised by the chosen - Amongst the elite
To sacrifice the flesh for the holy deed

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Spoken:]
My truth is within your lie
What makes us one, we both die
Your good is my evil
With your doubt, it will make my ego fly
