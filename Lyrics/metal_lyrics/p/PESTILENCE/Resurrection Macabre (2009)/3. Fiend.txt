Unstoppable urge to destroy the flesh
By injecting the venom into the veins
Destined to fade away therefore I detest
Being born in this hell, nothing to gain

Only pain and misery
Push the depression away
Disrespect of life for I only see
Salvation, injecting the venom every day

Changing into the beast I love to hate
I hate to love the ones that care
The chaos that is in my head is what I create
To forget who I was before the despair

Inject - Reject - Detest - My Flesh

Only pain and misery
Push the depression away
Disrespect of life for I only see
Salvation, injecting the venom every day
