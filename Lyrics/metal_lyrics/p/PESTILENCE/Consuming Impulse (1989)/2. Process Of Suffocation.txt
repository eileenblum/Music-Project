[Music: Mameli, Uterwijk]
[Lyrics: V. Drunen]

Smoke's penetrating the atmosphere
It comes forth from heavy industry
The layers of air sorrounding us,
are venomed by large factory chimneys

Environment pollution
Damage unmesurable
Nitrogen concentrations
Drive away the oxygen

Choking in the gas we self produced
The death of mother earth I introduce
Chemical rain drips from the sky
The more we breathe, the sooner we die

Climates change, oceans vaporize
Woods becomes deserts; no vegetation
Species of animals exterminated
The earth makes its last rotation

The process of suffocation
Coming genocide
Biocircle's disturbed
Humanity's suicide

Why give a child its birth
When we are poisoning our earth
The heritage of this generation
is a planet threatened with destruction
