To confess all of your sins
Is where you salvation begins
For the truth lies deep withi your soul
Conform to the holy dogma let it
UNFOLD

Salvation - Is the only way
Salvation - The healing of the decay

Revealing the dark thoughts
Is knowing your own heart
Expose all of you weak spots
And tell me where it rots

Salvation - Is the only way

Without surrendering you seal your faith
No angels or saints to carry your weight
Your innermost core needs to be revealed
And the dying soul can be healed

Salvation - Is the only way
Salvation - The healing of the decay
