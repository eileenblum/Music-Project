The new head rush, the new mind blow
Consuming minds like a tornado

Evolved awareness
Sucked dry to be down
Replaced by the unholy
Reply or die

To bow down and confirm to the world
Overruling all beliefs of the known religion

Evolved awareness
Sucked dry to be down
Replaced by the unholy

DOCTRINE

Evolved awareness
Sucked dry to be down
Replaced by the unholy
Reply or die

Smothered by the irremovable lar
Poisoned by the tongue of the liar
Building bridges to cross the
NEW

Hope of individual freedom is long gone
Tentacles of the DOCTRINE holding strong
