To dissolve into nothing less
To let your soul be at rest

To dissolve into nothing less
Extracted from reality
Surpassed emotional distress
Existence a sheer memory

It's time to dissolve
Let all fears go and surrender

Destiny of the soul preserved
In the vacuum of nothing less
Telepathy unspoken and non observed
Soon to be found hopeless

It's time to dissolve
Let all fears go and surrender

SURRENDER
