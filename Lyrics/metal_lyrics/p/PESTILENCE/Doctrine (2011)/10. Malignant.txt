Malignant

Rooted deeper than the subconsciousness
Lies an instinct so malignant
That one cannot grasp this infectious
Sickness, causing to feel indignant

Malignant

For it is diagnosed as being possessed
By the frightened one who cannot grasp
The false truth seen by the obsessed
Scared to acknowledge this genetic hex

Malignant

The heart and soul is so malignant
Eater of realities and make them none
Seeds older than time make pregnant
To disseminate the purest spawn, spawn

To surrender to the negative frequencies
Is to give your heart and soul to hate
No one can touch the mind mentally
See here the corpus and spiritus flesh made

Malignant

It's pure and evil source
Deep imprinted in the soul
Takes you on full collision course
To disrupt and to overthrow
