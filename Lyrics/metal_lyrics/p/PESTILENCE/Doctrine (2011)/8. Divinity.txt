To reach the highest level of divinity
For the soul to live into infinity
One must obey the universal law
For Karma has you with a claw

We are the divine, devourer of souls
We are the entwined, kings of the black hole

Empowered by the hands of light
To discriminate the fiends of the night
He earthly opium distracts and persuades
Leaving the holy path straight into the flames

DIVINITY

Into the black hole

We are the divine, devourer of souls
We are the entwined, kings of the black hole

This elite of entities in its highest of form
Judging the all there is with non human norm

Overseeing the spectrum of all time
Dividing the purest form the slime

We are the divine
WE ARE THE DIVINE
