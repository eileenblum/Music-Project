Unreachable by the mortal ones
For it is I AM GOD that gieth or takes
All hope of eternal life be gone
To the depths of the theological flames

Absolution - I giveth or take
Retribution - The branding of the fake

Baptizing the soul with love or hate
This is the beginning of where all it began

Absolution - I giveth or take
Retribution - The branding of the fake

The utmost pure is what I seek
To have mercy on their souls
The feeble ones is what I reek
To deny absolution as judged by the crows
