Fathers of the holy church
On thou knees and repent
Confess for I'm the new hurt
Also known as the blackest serpent

I am the universal dogma
Repudiate ancient forefathers of believe
I am the universal dogma

Structured hypnotism of the mind
Empowers the ancient ones to suppress

The corpus of doctrine I spit
With passion and fury I state
The absolute truth conscious I hit

I am the universal dogma
Repudiate ancient forefathers of believe
I am the universal dogma

The system of symbols proclaimed
By the ancestral authority
As the truth now reclaimed
For it is I AM GOD /the new purity

I am the universal dogma
Repudiate ancient forefathers of believe
I am the universal dogma
