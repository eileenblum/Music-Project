The smokescreen of deceit
To cloth the feeble mind
Answering our questions and need
The holy seduction of all mankind

Believe and reasoning are one
Proclaimed by the so called established
But without deceit the truth is gone
And the holy doctrine is dimnished

Seeing is believing
Believing is following

Using the world misery and pain
To show us how rotten we are
In the effort to maintain
The holy trinity - effort unreachable and far, effort unreachable and far

Seeing is believing
Believing is following
Following is religion
Religion is deception
Deception is LIFE

Portraying the famine of the world
To feed the need of the grees
Quenching of the underworld

Self preservation a man made disease
The smokescreen of deceit
To cloth the feeble mind
Answering our questions and need
The holy seduction of all mankind, of all mankind

Seeing is believing
Believing is following
Following is religion
Religion is deception
Deception is LIFE
