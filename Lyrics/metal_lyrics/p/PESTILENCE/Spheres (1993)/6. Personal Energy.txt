[music: Mameli]
[lyrics: Foddis]

The temple of the soul
Home of the spiritual source
Blessed with powers we unfold
Human magnetism, uncontrolled

Personal energy
The magic of nature
A presence of ourselves we cannot see

Personal energy
Consciousness, life towards the essence of eternity

A domain of harmony
Captured past and future
A vision of reality
Divided structures, the higher senses, polarity around all creatures,
Increasing possibilities of self-discovery,
Energetic thoughts creating electricity
