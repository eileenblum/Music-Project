[music: Mameli, Uterwijk]
[lyrics: Foddis]

Sceptical research of mind control
Fear of philosophical consequences
Theories given to master and use
the hidden abilities of your senses

Explore minds' mystery, and capabilities, a subconscious release

Distant perceptions from different times
Fragments from one's selfconsciousness
Deceptive visions can be so real
by trusting our gifted awareness

Mental force set free, personal energy, magic strength in me

The level of perception, reach incomprehension,
Imagination, lost in confusion

[Lead: Uterwijk]

Hypnotic state of reality
Offering gifts through which you'll see
The secrets kept from humanity and secrets they will always be

[Lead: Mameli]

The level of perception, reach incomprehension,
Imagination, lost in confusion
The level of perception reflects an illusion,
Mind intuition, constructive delusion
