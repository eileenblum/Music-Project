[music: Mameli, Uterwijk]
[lyrics: Foddis]

Hidden deep inside is one's personality
Intentions unaware await to be set free

Memories of how one used to be repressed by life's reality
Face what's left behind
A life of a different kind

The truth, a thousand tales
Twisted words, fantasies
Spoken by the tongues of the faceless identities, the beings so...

Multiple, Multiple

Revelation, of the inner transformation
Betrayer, of your self-creation

[Leads: Uterwijk, Mameli]

Burial of a former life by the power of your energy
Secrets long forgotten still hidden in the same entity
