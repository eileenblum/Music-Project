[music: Mameli]
[lyrics: Foddis]

Paved roads of deceit
Leading to all life's directions
So many went ahead
Self-denial at their horizons

Reaching out for all that's there to achieve
Despite your beâ¹ng and what you believe

Weakening of the truthful beâ¹ng
On the rise of a personality
Within your own creation of lies soon you'll be

In search of your entity
Betrayed by who you would like to be
A journey with your mind
Seeking traces you left behind

[1st time synth lead: Mameli]

Eye-sights replaced by views driven by human desire
Fulfillment of your dreams have made you a liar

[Lead: Uterwijk]

Soul Search
