[music: Mameli]
[lyrics: Foddis]

Within the bounds of begin and end lies the evolution of all that lives
Repeating history is its time ahead
Technology seems so primitive
Different eras unknown to man set standarts we've tried to discover
Revealing purposes of future lives explain the presence, past, the ever

Monuments misplaced in agelessness
They fill the void of what used to be
Lives beyond the ones we know
The mind's view on surreality
Days fade out the clock of existence when dreams start to roam the nowhere
Birth of new beâ¹ngs in nature's creation to die and evolve in a new sphere

Demise of time

Behold the vision of all dimensions from the perspective of eternity
Decades meet before my eyes surrounded by the edges of reality
