A crowded place
Faces race around me
They all are my friends
Still I know no one
I'm in seclusion

A realm of pain a cease of life
I'm feeling helpless to fight
A confined touch behind the mask
A picture painted gray and black

We're on our own
Distance grows between us
I disappear Embraced by fear
In isolation

After each word that I hear
The silence seems to grow
After a faint light shines through
A face still won't show

An image of what once was
Drifts further each day
Time washes the color away
Memory settles in gray

[Solo: Kimon]

I lay awake for the first time
A heavy mist surrounds me
A brief clarity that's slipping away
As I feel the truth pierce through me

I seek your hand a distant flame
A path for me to follow
A cry for help unable to
Cut through the dense silence
