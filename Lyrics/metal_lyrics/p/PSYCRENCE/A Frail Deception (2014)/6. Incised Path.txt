Can't control the strain
Can't defy the visions
I can see your life fade away

Seems to be so real
The scene within my mind
I shudder at your final scream

I have foreseen your ending come
Your last play in life will stay undone
No way to escape the incised path
Inevitable outcome

You're the next in line
You're the one who's chosen
Premonition shows the sequence

Faith controls the cards
Take a chance to shuffle
The prize is prolongation

Life's course is predefined
Death will collect you when it's time
Don't try to evade your end
Inevitable outcome
