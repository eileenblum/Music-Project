Last thing I remember
Pure madness in his eyes
Cold steel piercing through me

Memories frozen in time
Absorbed by the reflection
Eternally confined within

Share the pain with me
Release the fear

I try to stay awake
Help myself towards the light
But the darkness is too strong
I'm giving up the fight
I quietly disappear
A scarred entity remains
And hides behind my empty face

The prey stands before me
Stares straight into my eyes
It still cannot see me

I feed the blinding rage with fear
And reach for redemption
But each time slips through me

A world filled with decay
Where time exists no more
A sad reflection of the past
Where I stay awake forever
