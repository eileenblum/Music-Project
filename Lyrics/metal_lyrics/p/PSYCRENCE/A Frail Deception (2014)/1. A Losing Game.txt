I stood beside holding her hand
Feeling helpless and alone
As I watched her life drain slowly out of her eyes

A shadow came in human form
Made false promises to entice me
I was blinded by the sorrow that filled my soul

Bring them in the game
Shift the course of human lives
I must stray them from their path
Unaware of the dead end

Keep this dream alive
Give another chance to find
An escape out of the dark
Lost until we meet again

False faith took control of me
I fed lies into their minds
Trying to prevent her life's certain decay

Power to corrupt their fate
Too heavy a burden laid upon me
But I was too late to realize my mistake

With each false step I drown into frustration
Despite my efforts nothing has changed

A barren hope an endless separation
All seems lost without you beside me
