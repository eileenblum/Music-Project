I see the look inside your eyes
And I know you're lost forever
I see now that I'm to blame
And I fear that you feel the same

A journey deep within our dreams
A world that we could share together
I only wish that I had known
You lacked the strength to come back home

Addicted to a reassuring lie
A prison of lost memories
I reach out to you I'll show you the way
Don't run away

Don't run away from the fire
Burning wall rising higher
Hold close the flame
Endure the pain and burn that will release you

Illusion takes over your mind
A world devoid of all that pains you
You found a place you can't break through
And locked a truth that you once knew

Don't fade away in the silence
Overcome your own blindness
Hold close the flame
Embrace the pain and burn that will release you

A false reality growing inside your mind
Clawing at your flesh as you try to escape
The denial you feel slowly dissolves the line
Between dream and reality
