Seems like I always was aware
we had a purpose in our life
from which we were defined

Only now I realize
we were force fed our fate
in a prison in disguise

What if we could cure all disease
extend our life on earth
If we could look death straight in his eyes
and have a fighting chance

To find the right answer
you have to cross the line
They ignored all morals
now there's no turning back

They gave us a chance to learn
what it feels to be human
what it means to be alive

But still they all failed to see
the error of their ways
their deep moral decay

Accept to treat real humans
as disposable lab rats
