Memories have been wiped clean
Left just an empty shell
A body with a clean slate

Assign a personality
There's nothing out of reach
Your heart's desire made flesh

Visions flash before my eyes
Feelings trying to break free
Vivid traces of past life
Gradually resurface

Buried within us defeated and broken
Our bound soul lies sleeping
Slowly dissolving into the darkness
Remains lost but not gone

The warning signs from our abuse
Crushed underneath our greed
Forever sealing our fate

Highly advanced technology
Spiraled out of control
Now I fear it's too late

Instincts take over determined to wake the
Human will to survive
Forced evolution rising through the seams
Of flawed technology
