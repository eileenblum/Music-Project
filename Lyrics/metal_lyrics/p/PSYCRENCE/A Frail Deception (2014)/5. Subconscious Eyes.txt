Am I trapped?
A black shroud around me
Fate tried to enclose my life
Am I condemned?
I can't see your colours
but neither can you see mine

In darkness I was born
My perception I've reformed
The odds I have defied
My sight won't get confined

The image seems so real
Through every single feel
The world I realize
Through subconscious eyes

Although I have
No light perception
I can still see your face
A different way
To interpret the darkness
To sense what the eyes can't see

Close your eyes
Reveal my world
Within the dark
It will unfold

You have to let
Your senses flow
Then you'll perceive
with subconscious eyes
