Awaken from
A deep and strange sleep
I feel like I am reborn

I try to gather myself
All my memories erased

I wander through the unknown sunless days
Got nothing from the past to chase
Powerless I watch mankind's Fall
The only man to witness all

Everything seems so normal
Yet my worldâs time is in reverse
When both timelines converge to one
The end of days is realized

I have been brought back to life
I don't know the reason why
Just a watcher of the end
As destiny descends

My hope slowly dies away
Nothing will survive
Just a watcher of the end
As destiny descends upon us
