no words , can tell
my lust , for spells
which I , keep summon
upon you , to fail
you can , keep praying
for god's , shelter
to save you , from my magic

I keep on casting my spells
to summon my demons of hell
your god won't be on your side
when am chiming my bells

the angels of upper paradise will fall
on the rhythms of your crying soul
as I write your name with blood
I set fires into your veins

as this magical knife
cut the flesh out off the skin
I read the words out loud
to cast the curse on you then

now , I let your soul fall to the deepest ocean
and then I will know that you'll drink my potion

I keep on casting my spells
to summon my demons of hell
your god won't be on your side
when am chiming my bells

the angels of upper paradise will fall
on the rhythms of your crying soul
as I write your name with blood
I set fires into your veins

now , I let your soul fall to the deepest ocean
and then I will know that you'll drink my potion
and you finally sank your fake emotions
those , which once happened to be my retribution

it was my life that I gave to you to only say a word.!
it only needed a word to be spoken by your tongue that day!

so I'll cut out my heart and write your name with its blood
so I'll cut out my heart and write your name with its blood.
