I will find myseld dead as I rise
From my eternal sleep which will stop my heart

So I'm leaving this cold crule world
To join the demons inside hell in the seventh sky
So I'm leaving this cold crule world
To join the demons inside hell in the seventh sky
So I'm leaving forever..

I have fucked mylife back home
When I was completely .. blind
And time had filled my head .. with filth
Whcih was.. my escape from the light.

A light that I will never know
My soul was lost in denial
The angles are weeping my soul
Crying my name outloud.

To join the demons inside hell in the seventh sky
So I'm leaving this cold crule world
To join the demons inside hell in the seventh sky
So I'm leaving forever..

Mylife was wasted in complete ignorant dancing with skeletons inside of my closet
This late epiphany which stricken my mind can not save me now..
All I can do, is to root in silence.
