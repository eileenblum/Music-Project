Hit me hate me
Push me to the floor.
I won't feel anything anymore. 

My heart already stopped from pumping blood.
And its veins were shut for too long.

I don't have the will to live anymore.

I won't forgive you for what you've done to me before.
You have killed the child in me, and made him burn his angelic soul.

I have died too many years ago " at the time you were in love with her " 
I have lost my childhood because " because of you, because you did not help her ".

I wish that you will suffer in your grave " forever "
I hope that there won't be any mercy shown " upon your name ".
