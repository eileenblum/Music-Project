Darkness pulled us here, no clues lost our fears
I tried breaking out of here, it's cruel it's killing me.

Hold 
my faith
my dreams 
divine hate..

Pull me back
feel my heart, ist it near?
It's not your fault
what I've done, leave in peace.

I can feel it creeping in
inside, it's breaking free..
I tried to save what's left
indeed, it's changing me.

Pull me back
feel my heart, ist it near?
It's not your fault
what I've done, leave in peace.

These visions of tomorrow
lost destiny..
Forget about the yesterdays 
with no regret.
All the things you said
all the bleeding tears..
Throw away the sorrow, farewell my dear.

Farewell my dear
Farewell my...
