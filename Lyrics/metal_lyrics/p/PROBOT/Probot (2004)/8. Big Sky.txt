[w/Tom G. Warrior(Apollyon Sun, Celtic Frost)]

My world has died
All gusts and leaves
Your wondrous life
And love have ceased

And all you've touched
Is dead and gone
And night for night
We're both alone

Big sky throning over the tree
You've left behind
Through these tears lost
By your forlom only child
Big sky throning over the tree
You've left behind

It hurts inside
This silence new
And yet I know
This wind is you

And all you've touched
Is dead and gone
And night for night
We're both alone

Big sky endless in your own overwhelming pain
Free at last into the light behind this eternal rain
Big sky endless in your overwhelming pain

You'll never pale
You're never gone
And all within
I'm not alone

Big Sky
