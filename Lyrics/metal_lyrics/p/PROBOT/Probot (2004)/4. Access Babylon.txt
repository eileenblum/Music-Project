[w/Mike Dean(C.O.C)]

We're going out on a limb?
Our people are about to disown us now.

Incrementally change mentality
Speak of values miss the irony
What you once shunned
Is now what you seek
Three hundred sixty
And never miss a beat

Your people call my people
What's this? I'm skeptical
Success come knockin'
And we're dabbin'
See the circles that we travel in
Access Babylon, Access Babylon

All access, yeah, but not quite
Your cast goes left but not allowed right
Force field limbo caught in mid strata
Funds evaporate so-called-friends scatter

Your people call my people
What's this? I'm skeptical
Success come knockin'
And we're dabbin'
