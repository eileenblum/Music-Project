[w/ Lemmy (Motorhead)]

Looking for relief in your miserable life
You need some rock and roll
And you better get it right
Got to roll them bones,
Do everything they say
If you're cool, and you're the fool
Make it work everyday

Rock out, make it quick
My, my, my let it rip.
Rock out, feeling good
Break your heart, shake your blood

Out upon the stage, crowd is going wild
Love to see them women, babe,
I ain't in denial.
Make you crazy too. Make you show it out
Feeling good, get some wood you knew
You should, you knew you could

Rock out - do it now.
My, my, my - show me how.
Rock out - make it good.
Break your heart, shake your blood

Want to be a winner, want to be the man
Want to drive yourself insane,
Join up with the band
Want to fall in love, want to make your mark
Want to get out in the storm, want to break a thousand hearts

Rock out - do it now.
My, my, my - show me how.
Rock out - make it good.
Break your heart, shake your blood
