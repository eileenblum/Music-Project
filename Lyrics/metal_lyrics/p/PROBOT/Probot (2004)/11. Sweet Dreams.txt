[w/King Diamond(Mercyful Fate)]

Let me into your sweet dreams
Let me in
Let me into you sweet dreams

I'm watching you, go to sleep
I'm watching you but you cant see me
Dream on, sweet dreams
Dream on, Let me into your sweet dreams

I am the pain in your brain when you dream
I am the tears you cry, when your asleep
I'm the slimy Demon hanging on your wall
Touching you, watching you dream of me falling on you

Let me in
Let me into your dreams
Let me in Let me in Let me in
Let me in
Let me into your sweet dreams

I'm clawing at your skin, you gotta let me in
You'll never know my friend
Why I've come to steal your soul
Oh yeah! But your soul has turned gold

[solo]

Keep on dreaming as I feed on your soul
Keep on dreaming as your soul it turns to gold

Let me in
Let me into your sweet dreams
Let me in, let me in, let me in...into your dreams
Let me in, let me in, let me in...Sweet Dreams

I need your soul
I need your soul to pay my way out of here
Let me in!
Let me into your dreams...sweet dreams
I'm burning up, you gotta let me in
I'm burning up, let me into your soul
You gotta get me out of this fire, I'm burning up
Get me out   Get me out   Get me out
Of
Hell
