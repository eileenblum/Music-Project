[w/Max Cavalera(Soulfly, Sepultura)]

Red war will fall on my enemies
Babylon is full of hypocrisy
You feel the hate is for real
Cause Red War will fall on my enemies

Red War   Red War
Red War   Red War

WatchYaBackWatchYaBackWatchYaBack

The sign of the cross I carry into war
The Kyber Pass where no one rests
Hold my head up the Judah Lion
Twelve tribes in the mountains of Zion
Babylon fall and Red War will come
Babylon fall
Red War   Red War
