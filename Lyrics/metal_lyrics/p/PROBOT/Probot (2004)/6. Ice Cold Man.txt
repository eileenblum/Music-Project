[w/Lee Dorian(Cathedral, Napalm Death)]

Vampires of this earth hungry dying of thirst
Lifeblood in short supply
Black skies red watching eye
Burning into demise,
As all light slowly dies
Seeds of man's decay have
Grown to take away
The sacred gift of life
Mother nature cries as
Darkness fills her eyes
Yes we are blind, too blind to see
Our tombstone to destiny

Ice Cold man watches earth die
Eternal winter takes its reign
Devoid of light filled with pain
Ice Cold man watches earth die
Bleak the atmosphere
freezing warmest tears
The earth a ball of ice
Bodies frozen cold glacier heart and soul
All warmth has long since died
In his arctic hearse man rides death universe
For one final time through black frosted sun
Into oblivion

Ice Cold man watches earth die
Eternal winter takes it's reign
Devoid of light filled with pain
Ice Cold man watches the earth die
Beneath a veil of black ice
He sees now hell once paradise

Ice Cold man watches earth die
All love lost - lost without a trace
Behind his - frozen empty face
Defunct eyes - cold as arctic ice
Ice Cold man - pays the final price
Ice Cold man - watched the earth die
Ice Cold man... Ice Cold man...
In his arctic hearse man rides death universe
One final time through black frosted sun
Into oblivion

Ice Cold man watched his earth die...
