[w/Eric Wagner(Trouble)]

There are times when the road gets dark
Seem to have lost my way
Sophisticated abuse of reason
Day after day

Oh no please come for me
For me and my tortured soul

Haunted by ill angels only
I'm so very pained to say
Secrets of mind change reality
Are the things they said soul

Oh no please come for me
For me and my tortured soul

Words could never explain
I know it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
