[w/Wino(The Hidden Hand, Place of Skulls, The Obsessed)]

I do not die, but awaken from the dream I lived
As above? so below, be revealed, the truth be known
Questions, pieces strewn shrouded answers hewn
With love so grow, beneath his paws the tablets glow

Behold the falcon surveys the horizon
Great scribe let us see, your runes of mystery
Serpent shares your name, the keeper of the emerald flames
Prevail the law of three, the goddess guides humanity

He weighs your heart a life pure a life false
And they learn the sword deceived by false words
And so their greed and their lies cause them to be blind
And so become, the falcon
And so become, the falcon

And now the souls they swing
Swirl in the cosmic ring
Creations spark it has no time
Rejoin the realm divine

Enthroned true one he sails into the sun
Falcon at the helm glides through the netherrealm
Be shown unseal the laws have been concealed
Earthly majesty tables of destiny

Bloodline blood trail
The truth becomes the grail
So far so near cloked in the mists of fear
Aboce below what's hidden will be shown
Divine majesty true scrolls of destiny
What's concealed will be revealed
Those you see will be received
The law of three, humanity
The law of one, INTO THE SUN
