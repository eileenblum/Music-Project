[Hidden Track][feat. Jack Black]I am going to fuck your life up I am going to crush your soul
Two demons stand beside me now I am taking control
I never sleep I have got a sinister plan
Your world is weak now I am overtaking command
Because I am the Warlock I am the Warlock

I am going to fuck your mind up and you will be writhing in pain
Stare deep into my sceptre and now you are going insane
You try to run and hide I am going to slice you in half
You try to gather up your army now you are making me laugh
Because I am the Warlock I am the Warlock

I whisper the ancient scriptures I drink the blood of the lamb
And as I begin to levitate this is the day of the damned
Because I am the Warlock I am the Warlock
