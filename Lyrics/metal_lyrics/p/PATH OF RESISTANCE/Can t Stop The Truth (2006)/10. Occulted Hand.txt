The unrighteous and the insane have all written the rules
Indoctrinated from the bottle age continued by their schools
Is this not the great BABYLON?
How you are fallen in my eyes
Molten images of confusion refused by the wise.

Pyramids, obelisks, all their plots and plans
Outstretched strings from occulted hands.

Their forces are invisible and they deter our lives
Systems set against us, pressure not to try
Despised by the masses, maligned by the hordes
Cause we won't worship their masters, won't subserve their lords
March the long mile of virtue undistracted by false rest.
Through fire and through water, unto the gates of death.

Pyramids, obelisks, all their plots and plans
Outstretched strings from occulted hands.
