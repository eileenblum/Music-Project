Silver-tongue devils beckon with fantasies
Fools chase after unattainable dreams
Casting illusions of beauty and success
View the world through a sick lens of selfishness
All that glitters is all that matters
Worth and status through what's acquired
Item after item swallowed into emptiness
It's just a little further till the oasis
Item after item swallowed into emptiness
It's just a little further until the abyss.

RFID and its profiteers
With convenience take our lives
Kill the last vestige of privacy
Every wall they see behind
All that glitters is all that matters
Worth and status through what's acquired
Item after item swallowed into emptiness
It's just a little further till the oasis
Item after item swallowed into emptiness
It's just a little further to the abyss.
