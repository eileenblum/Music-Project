These are the hours where our souls are tested
Their resolve weakens
While the storm strengthens
I won't share in their dismal fate

As time passes the pressure intensifies to just give in
To be swept over and down to never return again
Tattered and torn
Taken by the wind
Frantic hands grasp to pull me under with them
The waves, the rocks, the tower on the shore
The light shines through the dark
Steer by it and be sure against the gale
Hold fast
Committed for life
With my skeleton crew
We will last even through this night
Hold fast the faithful.
