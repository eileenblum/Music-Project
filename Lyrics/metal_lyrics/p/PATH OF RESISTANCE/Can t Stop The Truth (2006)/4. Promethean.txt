It's for the future we fight now!
Sociopaths without burden of conscience
Full speed ahead on knowledge's quest
While the ignorant and selfish Frankenstein genetics
And tell us it's for our best
How can I not fight what I depise
When I see the future in my children's eyes.

Serpents of deception
Whisper promises to beckon in
On my word through thick and thin
I pledge my heart not to give in.

G.enetic M.onster O.rganism
Bioengineered
Designer disease disseminates
Real terror begins
Realms of science fiction now real, morality tales unheard
Promethean fire scorches the wind, no land undisturbed.
