Follow the blood trail
Follow the blood trail

How could there not be wars among us
When the meekest of the meek
Are tortured and crushed.
Hung inverted from a cold steel chain
Throat cut for their lifesblood to drain.

Follow the blood trail
Follow the blood trail

Trace the horror back to its source
With disaster mankind's
On a collision course.
Strip away the forests
For more grazing land.
Cattle bred and slaughtered
And consumed by man.

Follow the blood trail
Follow the blood trail
Back into your mind.
