Suppress what gnaws, nurture the myths
In the silence of their conscience
Cut through excuses til I clearly see
Truth not opinion, fact not fantasy
Sentient beings' freedoms denied
Fight to see through what propaganda hides
Fight to see through fight to see through
What propaganda hides
Controlled and caged, an existence of torment
In pain and sickness an entire life's spent
Stun bolt shattered skull to be killed is their fate
For the moment their flesh is set on a plate
Hatred, scorn and slander
My reward for the truth I've taught

Demons burn to smash the bearer of the mirror that flatters not.
