We've broken the bread
You can't be forced to eat
Rung the alarm endlessly
Couldn't kill the sleep
Doubters and flakes
Liars and fakes
Turn backs on consequence
While sealing others' fates
You can live a life of lies
You can disregard the proof
You can even kill your own conscience
But you can't stop the truth

Brothers and sisters
Family and friends
It's for the meek we fight
The oppressed we defend
In this time of deception
In this time of decay
Open your heart
Let love rule
Compassion lights our way
You can live a life of lies
You can disregard the proof
You can even kill your own conscience
But you can't stop the truth

There was a time our word was our pride
Now valor lies bleeding, morals in decline
These years have distilled my resentment and rage
Time to get right, plan our fight
Rebirth today
