Won't stray from the path that my heart has set for me
Disconnect myself from all the cruelty
When I look back there is nothing that I could regret
The best of my best, best of my best when I am compassionate
Vanity, laziness put to an end to that weakness
Took the time met my goal till I was free from the sickness

Fields of grain for feed waste wild land
Pollution from factory farms
Bacteria contaminates
None escape unharmed
The horrors of the slaughter house
To most their awareness is nil
Time to face the issue, force the answer
Its better not to kill
An unsustainable, destructive process
Weigh it out, don't deny
Its time to leave it all in the past

When I look back there is nothing that I could regret
The best of my best.
