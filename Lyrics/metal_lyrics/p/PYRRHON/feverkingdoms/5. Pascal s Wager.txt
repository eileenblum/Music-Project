Try to justify
Faith numerically
Suffer through the proof
Hope it helps you sleep

Reject reason instrumental
In keeping with your kind
Reducing your God to
A roll of the dice

Try to justify
Faith numerically
Suffer through the proof
Hope it helps you sleep

Betray every principle
Losing sight of goals
Force it to coherence
Got to make it work

Self deception
Crafted confusion

If God is a gamble
Belief becomes an empty bet
If Faith makes the difference
Then what's a man to do?
Convince the divine
Of sacred belief
By your own interest?
I'm hardly convinced

Betray every principle
Losing sight of goals
Force it to coherence
Got to make it work

Self deception
Crafted confusion
Try to justify
Faith numerically
Suffer through the proof
Hope it helps you sleep
