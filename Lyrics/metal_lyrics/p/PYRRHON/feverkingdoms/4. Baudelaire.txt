I worship the wicked
Thriving on decay
I worship the wicked
Thriving

Where you see corruption
The splendid meets my eyes
Collecting every blasphemy
Caresses for my soul
The process of unmaking
Creation in itself
Take form through entropy
It's mine and mine alone

Flouting every law
My hands imbrued in filth
Chapels turned to landfills
Frolicking in pus
This is the new aesthetic
Splendor photonegative
I am the new ascetic
Postulating slime

Splendid in decay
Grandeur in spoilage
Magnificent ruination
Beauty burgeoning

I am Baudelaire
I am Baudelaire
I am Baudelaire
I am Baudelaire
My visions will endure
