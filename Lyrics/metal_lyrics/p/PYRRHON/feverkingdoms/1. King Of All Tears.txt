Come out of the circle

We weep for the terror in your eyes
We disseminate our filth in the air
We thirst for the rape of your mind
We weep for the end of this aeon

We weep for the weakness of your flesh
We invite you to the cells of razor steel
We hail from the bearing without name
We weep for the end of this world

Total abjection at the end of every path
We shall awaken every sick thought you've dared to have
You'll beg for forgiveness, prostrate yourself and bare you throat
Our satisfaction in subsuming all you are

The air riots with sickness when we walk your plane
Reality -- fragile
Turncoats and deviants offer prayers to our name
See our mirror-face and despair

Total abjection at the end of every path
We shall awaken every sick thought you've dared to have
You'll beg for forgiveness, prostrate yourself and bare you throat
Our satisfaction in subsuming all you are

Come out of the circle
Come out of the circle
Come out of the circle

We weep for the terror in your eyes
We invite you to the cells of razor steel

The fever kingdoms, all the outside realms
Bursting with mind-pus
Lacerating chords from the scalpel choir
Parasites in your mouth, cancer on your breath

Bow down to the King-Of-All-Tears
Bow down to the King-Of-All-Tears
Bow down to the King-Of-All-Tears
Bow down to the King-Of-All-Tears
