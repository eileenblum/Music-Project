Each breath a shredded page
Each heartbeat a crack in the spine
Dancing to the screams from deleted lines
I march for clarity
With each step I am more despised
Force me to writhe in rational confines
You whisper a prayer a day
"Deliver, o Lord, his demise"
But bolts from the blue never darken the skies

Debunk the lies
Dominion defiled
Open mind's eye

Each breath a shredded page
Each heartbeat a crack in the spine
Dancing to the screams from deleted lines
I march for clarity
With each step I am more despised
Force me to writhe in rational confines
You whisper a prayer a day
"Deliver, o Lord, his demise"
But bolts from the blue never darken the skies

Darken the skies

Tangle my mind
Sever my senses
Bury me
Pluck out my eyes
Bind my fragile limbs
Bury me
Sew shut my mouth
Fill my ears with clay
Bury me
Whitewash my thoughts
Replace my soul with yours
Bury me

Constraints hobble your mind
Deaf, dumb and blind
Rifle through the text
For answers you can't find

Open your eyes, abandon the book
Open your eyes, abandon the book

Each breath a shredded page
Each heartbeat a crack in the spine
Dancing to the screams from deleted lines
I march for clarity
With each step I am more despised
Force me to writhe in rational confines
You whisper a prayer a day
"Deliver, o Lord, his demise"
But bolts from the blue never darken the skies

Darken the skies

Tangle my mind
Sever my senses
Bury me
Pluck out my eyes
Bind my fragile limbs
Bury me
Sew shut my mouth
Fill my ears with clay
Bury me
Whitewash my thoughts
Replace my soul with yours
Bury me
