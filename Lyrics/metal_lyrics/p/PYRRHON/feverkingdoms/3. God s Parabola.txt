Pelting east on 295
Redlight causeways drawn into the night
Giants idiotic
Standing watch with sightless eyes
Saw them first when I was young
Thought their watch was ageless
But I'm grown and wizened
And now I know their transience

I have dreamed
Let me tell you what I saw
Banks decomposing like martyrs
Hospitals vomiting disease
Expressways writhing in green
Cities fail
Blink out of existence
Like Christmas lights in February
Every song and soul you've ever loved
Swallowed up by entropy

God's parabola
Carries us into the dust
Drunk on virtue and vice
Blinded by lust

Power plants blowing to pieces
Dousing the land in gloaming,
And the giants fall
The work of ages
Lapsing into bruise-dark night

God's parabola
Carries us into the dust
Drunk on virtue and vice
Blinded by lust

I see iniquities absolved and a land white-washed
Where Christ and Lennon are unknown names

We fight and we play
Beneath crumbling steel giants
We never notice the difference
We never feel ourselves falling

Like rats
Given the run of a sinking ship
Like rates
Given the run of a sinking ship
