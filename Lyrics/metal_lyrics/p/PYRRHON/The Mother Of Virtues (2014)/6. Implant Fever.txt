Sometimes I stare for too long into the sun
Until my vision grows grainy with pixels
I can feel the dials in my forebrain turn
Someoneâs in there, tampering with the controls

Each new day sweeps the boundaries away
And Iâm left to redefine
Where the machines end and my mind begins anew

In this place
The background chatter is digitally remastered
And thousands of lenses bend the light
Until riddles are all I can see

Each new day sweeps the boundaries away
And Iâm left to wonder why
I should trust anything that I hear, see or think anymore

Theyâve filtered and vetted the input Iâm getting
And cross-referenced it with the finest algorithms
Ensuring that all content will seamlessly sync
With the receivers theyâve built in my brain
Thatâs the just the way that we do things these days
And itâs improving at an exponential rate

Theyâve made my skull an echo chamber
It clangs with thoughts theyâve designed

Thereâs no room for me in here anymore
Time to shut up and accept it
