The first time it was an accident
We cursed ourselves for months
But its liquid eyes and little fists
Smothered our principled objections

We were doing what our bodies told us
We were vassals to our lust

It got easier every time
We were praised and congratulated
Fecundity is the mother of virtues
We didnât feel bad about it anymore

We were doing what our bodies told us
We were vassals to our lust
We did it again and again

The spirit is willing
And oh, how the flesh is willing
Weâll thrust ourselves into the future
Again and again and again

And the birthing cries will bury
The echoes of the old koan:
Limitless flesh, limited means

It is right and good to drown the earth in seed
Itâs what we were put here to do
And by God if we arenât good at it

O, rejoice!
For soon the world will burst with wombs
The sun will claw for the trees in vain
And an ocean of bones will creak below
