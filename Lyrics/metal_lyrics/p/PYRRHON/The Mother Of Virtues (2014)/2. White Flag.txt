Itâs amazing what you can give up
If you just want to survive
Youâll discard cherished convictions
And spread yourself wide for your ravagers
When they approach to defile you

Voyeurs hiding behind the skyline
Peer down at me, but I try to ignore them
They track me through the aisles larded with treasure
And mock me at night when Iâm begging for silence

Donât want to be held responsible
You can take whatever you want from me
Just make sure I donât notice
You can take whatever you want from me

And the waltzes play on in halls of gold
While the misfortunates slop back and forth
Between the flophouses, clinics and prisons
Until their weight carves ruts in the earth

Donât want to be held responsible
You can take whatever you want from me
Just make sure it doesnât hurt
You can take whatever you want from me

This is the world weâve made for ourselves

But our acid abstentions
Will dissolve the limestone beneath us
And when the sinkhole opens up
We wonât deserve to be pulled out

Itâs amazing what you can give up
