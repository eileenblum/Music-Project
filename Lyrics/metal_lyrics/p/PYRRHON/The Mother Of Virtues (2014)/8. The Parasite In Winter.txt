The cold darts in like a scalpel
And cuts away the scraps of sleep
It exploits my weaknesses
âTil cracks creak wide in my old skin

Shivers flow down my body
The muscles jerk and snap
Livid flags in February wind

The lightbulbs gutter as I roam
These frigid, bloodless halls
Where the enzymes drip down slow
And despairing villi beg for my warm breath

Silence rests a velvet hand
On all the starved pests and empty beds
And the time draws near for me
To leave this place behind
