I met with the white coats again today
They fed me another optimistic prognosis
And pills that chip away at my strength
Even as they keep me alive
Count me among the enlightened ones
Who know that they've been cursed
I'll have decades to fight a losing battle
And to bleed from invisible wounds

They tell me my body is beautiful
But my innards turn sour as the years tick by
It's a glorious cage with luscious fetters
That will bind me until I die

And dogs stalk me in the street
I can feel their eyes raking my back
And dripping down my thighs
Their teeth seek the targets
That grow like moles on my skin
Whose light shines through my clothes
They can't be hidden away

They tell me my body is fertile
And that each pore bursts with the gift of life
But it's a glorious cage with luscious fetters
That will bind me until I die

I'm trying hard not to feel ungrateful
But it can really get you down, man
Being locked in forever with a weakness
That fate bestowed with a smile
And all of these gifts are good for nothing
But god keeps giving me more
Schedules to keep and payments to make
Blessed art thou, my daughter

I met with the white coats again today
They spoke to me in soothing tones
As they repaired the walls of my cell:
"The boon of beauty comes with a price
And it is your duty to pay it
Day by day, day by day"
