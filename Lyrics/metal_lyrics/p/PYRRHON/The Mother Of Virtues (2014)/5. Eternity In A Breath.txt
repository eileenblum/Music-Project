The world without is thin and strange
Like the last moments in a dream
Of lying afloat on a vast, lightless sea
Where vague premonitions loom up from the deep
To rasp at the half-truths that buoy your weight
âTil your mind is dissolved by the brightness of day

How can you stand the confusion?
How will you bear the pain?

Breathe.
