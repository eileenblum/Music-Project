Iâm standing on the platform
And thereâs a pile of trash bags
Swollen with former objects of desire
Stripped of office, like corrupted priests
In black plastic vestments

And cast out to vagrancy
So now they wait with me
Twitching with the palsy
Of the rats in their guts
That shriek as the train approaches
To take me home

Thereâs a negative copy of me
In a bus station on a dusty plain
A thousand miles away

And one day weâll meet
Swept up by different flags
Weâll lock eyes through gunsights
And I wonder which one of us
Will die beneath the otherâs knives
And I hope it will be him

Itâs not personal
But Iâll rip your throat out if I have to
Iâll tear your guts out if Iâm asked to
Youâll rip my throat out if you have to
Youâll tear my guts out if youâre asked to

Itâs nothing personal
Because weâre both the same
Lemmings rushing away from a mirror
And towards a cliff
