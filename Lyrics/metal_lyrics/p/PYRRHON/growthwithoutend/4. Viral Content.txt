You have nothing to say and youâre saying it
The words are empty, but still they reverberate

No sources or points of reference
Just impulse, momentum, and optimization

You have nothing to say and youâre saying it
You found the seam between truth and nonsense:

How many heads can you force it into?
How many mouths are compelled to repeat it?

Will anyone hear you through the static?
Or are you just another strain of it?

I have nothing to say and Iâm saying it
