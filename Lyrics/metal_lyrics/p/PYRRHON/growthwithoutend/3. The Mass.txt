You were a child when you first felt it
The mass hiding inside you
Its silent, fibrous bulk within
Pressing itself into delicate tissues

And so you bore its weight

While:
Your bones twisted around it
You ate until you retched
It grew harder to breathe
The string in your back frayed You put a good face on it
Fear cradled your soul in its palm
In the hours that bracket sleep

The doctors couldnât find the mass
Their machines turned up nothing
But you knew it was there
You could feel it shifting

And so you gathered yourself each day
And carried the mass in silence

The anchor inside the quiet stoic
The spindle of strength that guides the unwinding
The heart of your truest self

The mass will abide inside you always
And will sink you by heartbeats in the end
