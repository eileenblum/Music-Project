After all Iâve done for you
The countless secrets I laid bare
This is how you repay me?

And in return for a victimless crime
Committed in shadow, far from its eye
For this, the crown has unmanned me

Force-feed me the chemical scalpel
Slice me up down below

I slip from this world like an exile
But as the current fades from the circuits
The wetware pauses to savor the irony

No matter what becomes of me
My children will carry me into the future

We will stalk you through the decades
And castrate the minds of your childrenâs children
As surely as youâve castrated me
