The men gave me back my papers
Because they cannot not harm me anymore
They said I could read the words
But would not understand them

âCorpses without fingerprints
Locked doors and black helicopters
Searchlights from the sky
Human traffic in cargo containers
Cities drowning in tar
Deserts crisscrossed by cyclone fences
A constant low buzzing
And somebody laughing from far away

âMy walls have all grown eyes
And my steps are fettered by wires

âAnd then it appears
The final, grand absurdity
A great, silent heart
Sprouting vein-trees and capillary branches
Rendered obsolete
And spinning lonely through the iceâ

The men took their needles and entered my mind
And they sutured up the bad thoughts
They say that it was for the best
But I know that part of me is missing now
