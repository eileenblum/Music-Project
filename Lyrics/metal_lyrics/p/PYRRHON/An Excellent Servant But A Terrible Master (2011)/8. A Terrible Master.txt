I canât ever seem to sleep
And the TVs leer as they parody me
Their chatter sucks the air from whole rooms
No matter how many I turn off

Is this really how the world sees me?
Is the screen the lens of the mindâs eye?
I can feel myself shrink as the wilderness grows
And the microchips chirp in mocking conspiracy

The dying newspapers boil over with rumors
And no one can hear the bombs bursting from here
The charlatan experts prey on our fear
And the doctors prescribe palliative insecticides
For cancers they planted themselves at your birth
And the books are bound up with third-hand hearsay

But who can be trusted to pick out the liars?
Iâd do to them what theyâre doing to me
I can feel myself shrink as the wilderness grows
And the microchips chirp in mocking conspiracy

âRound here
Ninety million tons of concrete
Press down
On their tired eyes and soft frames
âRound here
Their brains collapse before their bodies
White noise
Clogging every orifice like glue

I havenât slept in weeks
A lifetime has passed and I donât know a thing
And I donât give a fuck what happens to me
All I want is to go to sleep
