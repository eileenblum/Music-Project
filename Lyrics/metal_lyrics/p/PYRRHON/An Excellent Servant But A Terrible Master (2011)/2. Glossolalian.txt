Iâve invented new words
For the work that weâve done together

Painful neologisms
Carved in your warm flesh
Scrawled in your torn flesh

Read deep into my nonsense
And I hope you fucking choke
On all it doesnât say

My voice has become toxic
Weaponized vowels
Acid gibberish

Snake, you coil in my home
And among my clothes
Iâve done all that I can
To drive you away
This is the last resort
Of a cornered animal

I know itâs wrong
Like fists full of barbed wire
I know itâs wrong
Like nightstick abortions

But I must vent this poison
Before it kills me

This is not justice
But that doesnât make a bit of difference to me
Blood will always out
And you deserve the worst
