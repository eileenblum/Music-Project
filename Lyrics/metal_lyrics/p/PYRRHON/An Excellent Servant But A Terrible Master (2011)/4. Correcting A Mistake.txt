When the bombs fell
We were in the hospital
Receiving the good news

The test results burst into flames
In the doctorâs hands
Glass perforated your healing skin
Overpressure broke our embrace
Shrapnel amputated your smile
And I learned what silence means

When the bombs fell
All the confusion fell away
And the earth was made simple again

When I awoke
I tasted blood and cinders
Like lubricants of change
A dying orderly told me
It was quick and painless for you

As his ribs broke through his skin
It was not quick or painless for him

Is it wrong to feel relieved?
Maybe this was for the best
Someone told me there was a plan

Theyâre making this world a better place
One mess at a time
