Talk comes real cheap
Expend and dispose, expend and dispose
These days, itâs what I live to do

Oh, I know this junk is tacky
But itâs what Iâve got to offer
Iâll just keep on spitting out more litter
Itâll heap up in disposable drifts
Some poor fucks will sort through it in shifts

Believe me, thereâs more where that came from

Where can I buy budget words to describe
The awful hole that gapes inside
Me, and just keeps growing, growing, growing
As I pour in more and more plastic metaphors

You know youâre gonna keep on reading
This shit, lightweight and stripped of the meaning
It once wrapped up, âtil I used it all up
Now itâs dross, compacted in metonym clumps

And all this waste comes straight from my waist
Iâm shitting out tons and tons of this garbage every year
Dumped logotoxins leach into the groundwater
Iâll make every ear my sewer

Itâs all trash talk, trash talk, trash talk
Throw me on the pile
No deposit for recycle
One use only

And all that offal is crawling
Back up through the plumbing
Itâs clambering out
Of the landfills and rivers

My filth children will wander
While I spawn more, and wonder
Why these refuse similes
All sound so incomplete
