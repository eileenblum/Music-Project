Deathâs release: just one more scam
Peer through your lifeless blue-veined hands
And watch the parasites rush in
To make a buck off your old carbon

Throwing up their pipelines
Across miles of ruined skin
Refining down your empty flesh
For nutrients and oxygen
Pinstripe-shrouded maggots seize
And monetize your memories

Oh, itâs too fucking sad
We gave up what we had
All that life, wasted on the living
And we, the dreamers, lost to the dream
