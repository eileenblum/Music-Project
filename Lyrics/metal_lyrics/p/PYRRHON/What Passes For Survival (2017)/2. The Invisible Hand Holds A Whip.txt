The numbers keep running
Somewhere I canât follow
To redacted transcripts
And data-rich shadows

Oh, I can feel the hands on me
They labor with loving efficiency
To carve away pounds of my flesh
As they comfort me:
âThis is how itâs supposed to beâ

The sources in conflict
Revised and provisional
The havens offshore
The fundingâs untraceable
But someoneâs getting paid
And everyoneâs got a theory

Oh, I can feel the hands on me
Pointing me towards the ones I should hate
Donât tellâem the maths got minds of their own
They want backs to walls
And blame always finds a home

This isnât what they promised me
Their tide wonât lift me back to my feet
Nickels and dimes weighing me down
And plenty of ocean for me to breathe

Ten thousand lashes for our sins
Donât know what Iâve lost but I feel it missing
Each voice for itself in this chorus of fools
The futureâs a coda, weâre singing the blues
And stealing our notes from the bank of dreams
Whose vaults echo deaf as the tune runs astray

Our numberâs up
We all gotta pay
