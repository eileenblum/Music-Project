Clot-brained cogwheel in the sheets
Turns and sweats and makes his lists
Drug-dream-wracked reprobate creeps
Towards the daylightâs tasks in heaps

Pearl-zenithed walking zit
Makes his home where he can fit
Shops around for flavored swill
Earns new ulcers with that shit

What oils lubricate his lust?
What libels lurk in songs he loves?
What lord commodifies his trust?

He donât know much but he knows this
You take your cut where you can find it

Drinksop spirit drowns the past
He just wanted to do his best
But trying only wore him thin
Fuck off, you didnât live through any of this

Prideful inmate sworn to stress
Bares his teeth at disrespect
Freedomâs a real pretty word
Take the options you can get

He chants the happy victimâs creed:
Let distraction succor me
And polish all my edges down
âTil I am smooth and blank as stone
To better fill my given role

Make me what I am
Make me the servant I was born to be
