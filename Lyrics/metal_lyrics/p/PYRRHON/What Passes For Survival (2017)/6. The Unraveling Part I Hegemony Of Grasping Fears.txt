Surrender grows in you slow
Its tiny grasping hairs filling the empty holes
Clotted and stiff, you wonder how you bloated so wide

The screens buzz hot in darkened rooms
Where resentment made a home of you
For the rest of its life, the rest of your life

Dumb drone lodged, rudderless in time
Fearful and thick, sclerotic and blind

The lifesore dam leaks above town
At home, your hands divide your gut
Deluded that some deeper trench
Could cure neglect, forestall the flood

The old rules slump like stricken trees
And all your hatreds burst to light
The little hairs that clog your heart
The little hairs wriggle inside

The systems unwind in glorious real time
Nothing is real, and everything is fine
Itâs a new world, you have your pick of lies

Your hallowed despair birthed no insight
Just lust for the heel turn, the bullyâs glib spite

You know itâs shit
But weâre all taking a bite
You donât need consent
A few precious organs quit, the whole body dies

The hour grows late
And the blade nestles shy
To await your throatâs final complaint
