I saw a man crushed in the subway
Four years back
Some college kid from Queens

Traded shoves on the platform
With some desperate debased drunk
Who dragged them to the tracks
As the train came
His scramble too slow by a second

Surprise on his face
When they wrenched his pulp
From between the car and the platform
I was gone by the time he died
Gasping in the ambulance

There mustâve been hundreds
Who saw him there stricken
Their voices burst forth fluid
And we all drowned in the flood

The sight of him sodden in unwilling eyes
His life seeping down into concrete
Into the records that name and contain us
When our lovely shells are gone

The numbers go up and up
But the sum never makes sense
