[originally by Death]Built from blind faith, passed down
From self-induced fantasies
Turn a page to justify

Conjuring power, it opens wide
On your seventh day
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want

To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wound with a cross-turned-dagger

Inside Crystal Mountain, evil takes its form
Inside Crystal Mountain, commandments are reborn

All the traps are set to confine
All who get in the way of the divine
In sight and in mind of the hypocrites
A slave to the curse, forever confined

Shatter the myth, don't cut yourself
On your words, against dreams made of steel

Stronger than any faith
That inflicts pain and fear
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want

To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wound with a cross-turned-dagger

Inside Crystal Mountain, evil takes its form
Inside Crystal Mountain, commandments are reborn
