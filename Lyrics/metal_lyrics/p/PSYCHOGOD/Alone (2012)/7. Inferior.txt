Helpless, surrounded by sin
Walking around with the devil's kin
Slaves of a hateful world
Receive now what you've foretold

Deceived abused, aroused by evil
Your burning flesh reveals scars
Decayed, succombed in your own minds
Believe there is no more freedom

[Chorus:]
Scream, walk, run, you'll never see
Hate, bleed, drown, you'll never be
Lost, dope, scared, you'll always fall
Killed, slaughtered, disgraced, you'll hear the call.

Hold down your anger
Rescue your empty soul
Reload your fearful guns
Conquer your shallow stones

Scream all you can
Run just to fall down again
Run until you set yourself free
But you'll never ever be

[Chorus]
