Deeply awaken in this nightmare
I am living in a corpse
No light, no wishes come near my soul
Only the farthest screams, I can bearly hear
My senses lost in this war
No one can see me...

Trapped inside this shell
I am longing for
Distant dreams I've lost
Scattered memories

In my unholy sleep
Blood is everywhere
Pain and ravished thoughts
Burn my unblessed skin

Far from everyone
I will fight aloneThe demons in myself
Haunting all my life

Keep your eyes closed
Shut your lips
Hold your head high
Here comes the abyss

Terminate the terror
Terminate the screams
Terminate the pain
That's what I stand for

Deeply awaken in this nightmare
I am living in a corpse
No light, no wishes come near my soul
Only the farthest screams, I can bearly hear
My senses lost in this war
No one can see me...

I am all alone
Can you see me?

I am all alone
Can you see me?
