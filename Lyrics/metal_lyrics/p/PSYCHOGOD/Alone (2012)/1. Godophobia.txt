Your lips, my veins
Sad eyes, cut wrist
It's been, seen again
Empty words, in vain

Empty my soul from these feelings
Make the blood unstain
Empty my mind with these beings
The world's to blame

[Chorus:]
Thrown away from life
Thrown to hell from your world
You deny
You will fall

Your pain, my dreams
All shattered, it seams
My blood, your skin
Neverending, horror film

Rebuild my world from this nightmare
Make my soul reborn
Rebuild my world so it can take
All this scorn

[Chorus]
