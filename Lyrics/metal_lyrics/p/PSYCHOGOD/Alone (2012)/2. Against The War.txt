The truth was always kept away
We all lived in fields of lies
Our concousness is full of blood
Our minds are set all the same!

[Chorus:]
Fight for your freedom,
Fight for your souls,
Fight against their treason
Fight against their wars!

Rage boils insisde of me
Hatred grows stronger
These are the things that should not be
Prepare to release your anger

[Chorus]

Aaah, they should all be dead
Not here, alive in my head
No, they should all be burned
So no one will ever get hurt!
