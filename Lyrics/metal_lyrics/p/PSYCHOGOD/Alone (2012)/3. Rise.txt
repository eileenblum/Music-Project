[Chorus:]
Rise, rise, rise
Rise to set fire
Rise to your desire
Rise to burn the weakling
Rise to a new beginning

Break away from the cirle of pain
Leave nothing behind
Break down to keep rising again
In ashes you'll see the sign

[Chorus]

Break apart from the anger inside
Fall away from your thoughts
Break the fist that's suffocating you
See the weak fall

[Chorus]

Rise, rise, rise
Rise to set fire
Rise to your desire
