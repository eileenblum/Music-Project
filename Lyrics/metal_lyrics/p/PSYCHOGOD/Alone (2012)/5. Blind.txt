How do you expect to see
When your eyes are full of blood
How do you expect to know
When your mind is all fucked up

[Chorus:]
Call for help from your god
Beg for mercy from the crowd
Stand down on your knees
Time to do as I please

How do you expect to breath
When your air is poison
How do you expect to live
When your world is broken

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Pray for help
Pray for your life
Pray for your peace
You fucking hypocrite

[Chorus]
