Your eyes, vision of nightmare - in pain with yur mistakes
Your sky full of silence
Your tears on the floor - shallow dreams of emptyness
Your life left behind

[Chorus:]
We're not who we are
You should see that far
We're not what we say
You should stay far away

We're not who we are
We're not what we say

My name across the mirror - there's still blood there
My shadow on the ceiling
My fate was never yours - swallow your beliefs
My eyes cold as hell

[Chorus]

There's nothing left there - you should be gone
Only dust awaits
There's the yellow mark - across the crime scene
No corpse left to find

[Chorus]
