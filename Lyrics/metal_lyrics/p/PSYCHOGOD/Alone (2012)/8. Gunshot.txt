Pain, pain is all I feel
My life, drained away
Pain, pain is all I live for
Nothing is real anymore

Cut open the wounds
Break out this feeling
Cut open the scars
Transcend into another being

Hate, hate is all inside
Burning, crawling, I can't hide
Hate, hate I wish for
Nothing is real anymore

Cut open the wounds
Break out this feeling
Cut open the scars
Transcend into another being

Fall into the black abbyss
Let my soul decay
Fall into the darkest pits
With the worms I shall stay

Kill your god, gunshot
Kill your god, gunshot...
