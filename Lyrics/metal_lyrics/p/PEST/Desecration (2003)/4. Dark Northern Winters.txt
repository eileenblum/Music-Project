Dark northern winters
A pale white fullmoon glows afar
Its lifeless light leads us forth

Dark cold emptiness
Our frozen hearts shall never bleed
Spirits of immortality, spirits of northern pride

Cold. I walk into your depths
- Night eternal
Cold black hate
Dark northern winters await

Dark northern winters
They fail into the winds of the plague
All human life shall die
inside its glimmering darkness

Dark northern hate
We are the pain inside you
We are the nails driven through your souls

Cold. I walk into your depths
- Night eternal
Cold black hate
Dark northern winters await

Dark northern winters
Your souls are bleeding
Dark northern hate

Dark northern winters
our triumphal procession
Dark northern hate
We are the hands of Death

Chasm open, evil spreads
Cries shatter the silence
Beneath our northern heaven
lies his feeble servants dead

We are the bringers of the storm
The reaping winds upon his breed
Upon his throne, upon his realm
his blood streams upon my hands

Sun shall not rise again
Your god shall not rise again
We unite in deepest hate
Dark northern winters await

And I walk into your depths
- Night eternal
Cold black hate

Dark northern winters await
