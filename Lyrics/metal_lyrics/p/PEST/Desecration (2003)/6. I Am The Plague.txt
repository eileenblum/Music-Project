Mesmerized by fire
Endless dark flames
My eyes bleed
This desolate deam breeds in me

The cross lies shattered
As i crawl out of the abyss
Night descends
Lives wither before me

A journey through aeons of tragedy
I rape your world in scorn
Onwards through infinity
into chaos, into war

I am tragedy
I am darkness
I am the plague

I am torment
I am grief
I am the plague

I am bereavement
I am decease
I am the plague

Stench of destruction
Hell rages
The battle is unleashed

Dead sols arise
Crushing the gates
Vortex of the ever damned

Black death spreads
Condeming humanity
To misery

Mesmerized by fire
Endless dark flames
My eyes bleed
This desolate dream possess me

Silence falls
Heaven darkens, all is dead
Memories of life so pale and vague
Misanthropy leads me
- I am plague
