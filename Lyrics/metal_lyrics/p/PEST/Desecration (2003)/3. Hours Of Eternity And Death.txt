Shadows gather, eclipse the sun
A vague trail of souls fallen
Leads into the realms of death
A cry for mercy sounds unheard

Day of decease, day of grief
The hours are eternal
Black veil of torment
Fall on lives once blessed

They praised his love
They praised his lies

Bound by chains of Christ
They withered beneath his cross
Burning winds rend their flesh
Pain transcends, the hours of death

Bound to suffering
Bound to bleed
They sought a kingdom gone
They sought a kingdom dead
They sought his gates in vain
