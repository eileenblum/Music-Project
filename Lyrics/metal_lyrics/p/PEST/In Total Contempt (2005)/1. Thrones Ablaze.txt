On that night I saw thrones ablaze
The gates of heaven in fiery chaos
Triumphal processions heading north
Christianity doomed to fail once more

The last bell chimed possesed in the dark
Humanity forced to fade away
Condemned I tasted the blood
And possessed I joined the procession

Thrones ablaze in the dark
A thousand fires burning as one

Blasphemous reanimation of ancient times
And a new dawn emerges from the ashes

Fear it's light...
Hear the new bell chime

Profane wastelands embraced us all
In a beautiful night without end
Treading fields of lives burned
In an existence impaled by demise

In a land of fog...
Life ended
