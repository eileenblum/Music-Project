Beyond redemption
Far from their burning sun
That they will see fade away
And it will get colder

Their eyes filled with dismay
For every newborn wind a death
And for every soul a new chill

And I am with the desecration
Reflection that fear in their eyes
Beyond Redemption

No Return...
Their Christ was never born
Their faith...
A myth bygone

Beneath cold skies
Fathering strength to live another day
In a realm reeking only darkness
Reeking only despair and famine
Reeking certain death

Abondoning all hope and will
Ready to behold the ice cold sun
Their final sight before demise

They never knew...
They only believed
