Distant cries transcending
At the final rays of light
Ancient bestiality awake
The ruins of the race of man

Rending blissful dreams 
In a yet conscious sleep
Signs in fire and blood
A world enslaved, at its knees

Through the eyes of raven dark
To the wolf in heart
The seek of thy majesty
Of a withering heresy 

Lungs of black air
Spew forth their stillborn saviour
The harvest of truth, the downfall of all
Light flicker and die

Kneel before your burning sanctuary
And let the fire consume your flesh

Seeds of higher knowledge 
Spirits born to reign
Punishment unleashed
A new dawn, a dawn of flames

Dethroned and spat upon
Fallen in disgrace
Enslaved for aeons by the lies
Beneath the cross of resignation

Once bathed in the foul light
of a sickening deity
Now drenched in the blood 
of a sacrificed humanity
