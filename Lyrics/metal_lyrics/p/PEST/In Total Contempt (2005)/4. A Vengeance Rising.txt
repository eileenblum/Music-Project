Possessed and tormented
Dead eyes inside
Yearning for rapturous death

You are the bearer
Of all I despise
Vengeance rising
Lust is for your demise

The sacrifice is thine...

Path of knowledge
Path of the plague
To hidden treasures below
The treasures of extinction

Daggers of distress
True demonic roots
Stabbed into your chest
Now blood obscures your visions

Nailed to the burning words
All words in murderous silence
Hatred is still burning inside

Possessed and tormente
Dimensions collide
Hail the coming era
The raging age of tyranny

You are the bearer
Of all I despise
A vengeance rising
Wrath, destruction, demise

The reeking flesh of their corpses
Is the smell of victory
Their false vision guidance
No longer will they decieve
