Let him who do not worship the beast and his image - who does not accept his mark in his forhead or in his hand - drink the wine of the wrath of Satan and be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of fallen angels and in the presence of the goat... and then the end shall come...

Behold the end

Behold the darkness making the world empty
and turning it upside down
The laws are trangressed, the ordinance broken, 
the everlasting covenant is broken

The flocks of sheep are made desolate
The fires have burned their fields
The rivers of Waters all dried up
Behold the end

Fear not the master, give glory to him!
For the hour of judgement is come
Walk his path, after your own lusts
These will bring the end of sorrows

The coming you must Always await...
The promise of his return
And then the end shall come...
And then the end shall come...
