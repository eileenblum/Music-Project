A face of death, obscured by time
Burning visions of the end of all life
And I shall burn for this until the end

Forged in fire, moulded by death
Make me the one to know of your darkness

Fire of triumph, force and decay
Lead me now...

That day lives in my thought
No foul stench of life
Feeling closer to what would be
your god's cre(m)ation

I see all burn and ashes fall
There is no life in these dreams of mine

Only evil... and purest death

A face obscured by death
Feel the eternity of destruction,
see the sign, listen to their voices call
A face obscured by death
Every night, drunk on obsession
every day is one of death and darkness

In my thought, I'm going through fields of light
Leaning over the kill, a sacrifice to the flames

The neverending fires!

A face obscured by death
An empty shell of white pale flesh
dead black eyes filled with frozen fear
A face obscured by death
Possessed by this obsessing sight,
now make me the one,
to know of my own darkness
