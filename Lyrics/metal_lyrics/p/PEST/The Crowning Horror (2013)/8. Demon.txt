And fire burned the heavens black
The evil turned all life to death
The Wheels of time have come to an end
There is no light to follow out of the dark

Demon! Demon! Bring the darkness

Ascending death...
from the realms of obscurity
Their purgatory - Hell - the next step
A triumph for the tormentors,
the opposers and all oppression

Prince of demons ascend with might
The black ange crowned with horns
With this trident, with his Powers
He will rise and all shall follow
