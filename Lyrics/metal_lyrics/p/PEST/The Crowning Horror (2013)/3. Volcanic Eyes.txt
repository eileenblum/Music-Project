Sacrifice me
Origin of your lust
Chain me to this grave in your void
Beyond sin, your throne of punishment
In throes I kneel, praying death shall set me free

In filth I'm crawling
Calling out your name
Through my pains you rise to kill again
Through I live, I die through your every move
I reach for salvation, my soul slowly drifts away

The devil's eyes
Penetrate our shadows
Her eyes are his in this mortal world
Her gaze like lava streaming into my mind
I stand enslaved shackled to evil

Burn me now
Burn me down to ashes
Burn me so I can see into myself
I succumb to the raging flames, come tyranny
You slide your nails into me,
pain turns to ecstasy
Crush me, then lead me, let no light deceive

I crawl, I bleed,
the hounds of hell are over me
Waves of fear rend my sanity,
burning in holocaust light
I stare, can't breathe,
my rotting heart has cesed to beat
Condemned forever, sulphur flames
Blaze like her volcanic eyes
She worships death
Truthful as God
Come drink my putrid blood

Ready to strike
Laughter of the jackal
All I hear as I die

The serpent's eyes
Penetrate my shadow
Her life is mine is this dying world
Her hate like lava streaming through my veins
I lie subservient shackled to evil

Unholy ways
Death to innocence
Blood flows
from the wounds gaping on my chest
Cut deep, my skin burns like fire
Your venom inside of me,
thousand plagues healing me
Nightmares reveal, this unholy might

I crawl, I bleed,
the hounds of hell are over me
Waves of fear rend my sanity,
burning in holocaust light
I stare, can't breathe,
my rotting heart has cesed to beat
Condemned forever, sulphur flames
Blaze like her volcanic eyes
