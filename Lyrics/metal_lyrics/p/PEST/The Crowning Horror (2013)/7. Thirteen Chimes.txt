Thirteen chimes from the bell of impending doom
The damp cloak of night has fallen
They are waiting in silence
See the glare of the fallen stars in their eyes
With the hunger of the dead
Smiling in dreadful bliss
They came to reap the seed of kings,
not mourn their loss
They came to thrive on every quietus
and reign for eternity
Compelling words in every throe
throughout my flesh
They speak in tongues of seething lust
I rise in ecstasy

The ones to bleed shall call for their children,
(now) devoted to me
Let them be branded by the fire
of the rising anathema
I bring damnation, seas to blood, earth to dust
Believers fed unto the beasts
Ascending on sulphur wings

Chains of steel shackle our prey writhing in fear
Pleading words for mercy
The world burns, their faith reduced to nothing
Their pains shall set us free
Death shall strike down with me

I suffered a thousand plagues
to win this throne of might
I walked through the deserts of hell,
through torment and death, laughing
I entered the hollow fields
with my spirit drained from life
Forged in your flames, I shall rise again to conquer

Far above the graves,
far beyond all light,
far beyond this earth
Tortured spirits yearning for their end to come
They walked into the blood filled halls of oblivion

A time of endless terror,
a war that never ends,
a blade that never rests
And there is no answer - shall never be found
Just these sordid hands that shall rip
through the throat of your god

Thirteen chimes from the bell of impending doom
The damp cloak of night has fallen
We murder in silence
Judgement lies within my hands, the redeemer
To sentence slaughter upon their kin
Salvation through suffering

I suffered a thousand plagues
to win this throne of might
I walked through the deserts of hell,
through torment and death, laughing
I enetered the hollow fields
with my spirit drained from life
But in your flames I shall rise again
Reborn to conquer
