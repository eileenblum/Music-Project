Upon the hill a cross burns
A fire lit as a sign of war
The rival is your god
As fires burn the promised land

"To death your child will burn
No redemption, no second coming, no return
Your redeemer, son of god,
will not again descend
Now let there be darkness in the firmament"

Down below the fallen skies
Armageddon is breaking out
Satan walks the earth
The great tempter is now the law

"The son of your father is lost
Fading away in the fire with the cross
Death to the disciples who now follow
Seek the way into the flames of the unhallowed"

The abandonment of the god
when faith is lost and hope is gone
A desolation of a dream
Fires reap as shadows feed

Into the black light at dawn
we walk with the rise of chaos
The blood is on our hands, but
we never sought no gates of gold
