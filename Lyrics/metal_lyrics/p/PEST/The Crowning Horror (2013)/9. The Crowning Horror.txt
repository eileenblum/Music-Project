A coven of evil
Thirteen calls to death
All for the one
beyond the seventh

A sabbath of fire
Thirteen candles lit
Sworn to the oath
Never to come back

An ode to the devil
Thirteen daughters summon
Demons from below...
- The crowning horror
A path of darkness
Thirteen to behold
Black smoke in the air...
- The crwoning horror

A presence of doom
where evil Always hunger
A burning lust for vengeance
Hiding in the night

A serpent of death
is what the winds have wrought
A venom to this world
Awoken in hell's fire
Never to look back

An ode to the devil
Thirteen daughters summon
Wrath of nameless terror...
- The crowning horror
A path of darkness
Thirteen to behold
The seven gates appear...
- The crowning horror

An ode to the devil
Thirteen daughters summon
Death and destruction...
- The crowning horror
A path of darkness
Thirteen to behold
And seek the world below...
- The crowning horror

The bells they chime no more...
Morbid shapeless death is here...
