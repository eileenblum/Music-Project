I forget to see the sun
I forget when it does come
I lost the joy that makes me dense
I donât know when it has begun

I forget to see the sun
I forget when it does come
I lost the joy that makes me dense
I donât know when it has begun

When the fears arrive
Engulf your head, write in it as a scribe
Your mind has resigned
Emotions are running away
Supplanted by the dark

What happens after having accepted this unease?
Conjuring your opinions to make a way for the devil
Did you feel so disarmed?
Now who controls your arm?
You were so dissected that
You became blind to this new nightmare

Lose yourself into my inquisitive eyes
They will reveal you a glorious past
You were like nothing, a piece of dirt before
Considering the world as a pretty whore

I, I want to transcend
Why defeat the purpose that they put in my brain?
Now I am not alone
This creed is now my passion
Itâs too late â I am gone
You have not to blaspheme
They have taught me to wear a good looking face
But growing in the dark
Lives something diabolical
Ready to break your fate

I remember the man you were, so far away from now
You could have bewitched even an angel
So far away from now
Where are you now?

In ecstasy

What happens after?
Do you enjoy what your mission is?
Do you see your mind is toxic like a cancer?

Donât try, donât try to understand

I want to transcend
Why defeat the purpose that they put in my brain?
Now I am not alone
This creed is now my passion
Itâs too late â I am gone
You have not to blaspheme
They have taught me to wear a good looking face
But growing in the dark
Lives something diabolical
Ready to break your fate
