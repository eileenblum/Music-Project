You were my succubus
The one who made me believe, believe in âusâ
We found the way to Avalon
That so many people dream on

Hidden away from all mortals sights
There is a place where fantasy lies
A haven for all lost on the sea
A place where I wanted to be

(You may laugh)
You may cry (at me)
You may die
(From your throne) forever more
(So far from me) away from Avalon
(You are not the one who possess me)
(And I only have one word to say)
(Iâm not your slave!)

You were my, my lady
You betrayed me, you chose for me
Taking with you, your secrets
Leaving me with regrets

Hidden away from all mortals sights
There is a place where fantasy lies

(You may laugh)
You may cry (at me)
You may die
(From your throne) forever more
(So far from me) away from Avalon
(You are not the one who possess me)
(And I only have one word to say)
(Iâm not your slave!)

I leave this black rose on the ground
You and me know it was our bound
Stamping on it firmly
Hating it for eternity

Hidden away from all mortal sights
There is a place where fantasy lies
A haven for all lost on the sea
A place where I wanted to be
