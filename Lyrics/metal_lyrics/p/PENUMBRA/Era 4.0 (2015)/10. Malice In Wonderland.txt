(So frail, illusive and ephemeral)
(Your so called richness is superficial)
So frail, illusive and ephemeral
(So frail, illusive and)

I tasted your fucking magnificence
But love with you was a non-sense
Nothing can really hurt or touch you
Your heart is the one of a statue

I believed you could open your mind
How could I be so blind?
(How could I be so blind?)
Youâre only interested in your life
Your selfishness is like a knife

(Malice in Wonderland)
(Malice in Wonderland)
(Your world is only built with sand)
(Only built with sand)

So frail, illusive and ephemeral
Your so called richness is superficial
(Superficial)

I donât know really why
I never watched the sky
I prefer to be this woman
This one who delights in an illusive world
I will go out of my mind
Iâll never see the stars...
Why shall we give a sense to our life?
We will all meet one day on the other side

Did you lie to me? Did you lie to yourself?
How could I be so blind?
You told me that you gave me your heart
To manipulate was your own art

But one day, your world will collapse
Realizing many years have elapsed
The darkness of your heart will spread
And death wishes will burn your head

So frail, illusive and ephemeral

I donât know really why

I prefer to be this woman
This one who delights in an elusive world
I will go out of my mind
Iâll never see the stars
Why shall we give a sense to our life?
We will all meet one day on the other side
