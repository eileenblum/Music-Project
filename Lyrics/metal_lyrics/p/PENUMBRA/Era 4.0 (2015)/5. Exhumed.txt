I had failed in love
And my heart was so cold
Did it beat before?
As I had to run to the other side
Then a smile has come to me
He was also hurt by life and disgrace

Words that came in my mind were
âYou belong to meâ
Suddenly I realize
What âat first sightâ would mean

I would blame my life
He should have come before
I give all my days and nights...
To another one
To another one...

And I thought for the first time
That there was a way
I didnât know
Now I see, Iâm the immoral one
Donât care about this at all
âCause I need to answer to submission

And I really feel my grave has gone
Sure, Iâll never get down
