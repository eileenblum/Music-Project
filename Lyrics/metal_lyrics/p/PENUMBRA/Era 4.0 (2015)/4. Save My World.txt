You make the word love your enemy to play in this comedy
Betraying things I believed in
Your uttered words were a sin
Your love shaped the grim reaper
I felt the pain just after
I didnât breathe anymore and threw my pride on the floor

What was your reason to tramp our passion?
Did you know it was a poison for me?
Hurting me furthermore, leaving me on the floor

What? Now! What never comes around comes at last
Donât try to fill that empty space
As we should have seem it for a while

What? Now! What never comes around comes at last
Donât try to fight that empty space
As we do go so far, now, go arise!

Betrayal?
I say to myself my love has gone
Life is sometimes hard to describe
As we only survive thanks to a vision

I never succumbed to madness
Even if I felt its dark embrace
Pain can have so many faces
Only one turned my heart into ashes

Would you die for a god youâll never be?
A model of perfection, you see?
And every smile on your face will be a bitter mission
Change yourself as you wonât change your side
Anytime youâve gotta feel that pride
Donât try to fight that empty space
As we do go so far, now, go arise!

Somehow, someday, a still unknown smile will carry me
Rousing me from my lethargy to forget all what Iâve done
I live for this day and I will deny who I ever pretend to be
(Nonexistence, so much distance)
In the underground of my soul that I even dare to know
Where should I have gone?
(For the one you will gave your body and soul)
And I, and I, I will float and rise
(For the one you will gave your body and soul)
From the ground and Iâm still waiting for a sign

Betrayal?
I say to myself my love has gone
Life is sometimes hard to describe
As we only survive thanks to a vision

I died, died, died, I died for love
I gave, gave, gave my soul and hope
I died, died, died, I died for love
I gave, gave, gave my soul and hope

???? my frozen heart
???? love at first sight
I know my pride ????
???? my skin
