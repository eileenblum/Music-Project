On this river of silence
Fed by these sorrows
Comes with innocence
A lust for the crows
She smiles like an angel
Despite of her travel
They will catch your dream
Will be fed with your scream

(Oh...)

She smiles like an angel
Despite of her travel
???? betrayal

And on this river of silence Iâm traveling to the dark
(Iâm traveling through the dark and I)
See a face in the distance that waits for me to come (that waits for me to come)
And everything around is so deep and strong
In the end when all seems to drown in the sand

Every fortress has got its defender
Each journey has got its watcher
My name is Charon
Iâm an illusion
They will catch your dream
Will be fed with your scream

And on this river of silence Iâm traveling to the dark
(Iâm traveling through the dark and I)
See a face in the distance that waits for me to come (that waits for me to come)
And everything around is so deep and strong
In the end when all seems to drown in the sand!

(Oh...)

All her words sound like a whisper
Anywhere she looks for her lover
How to go through death on its own
And rejoin the darkness all alone?

Then I think about myself
Ashes are falling down on me
And comes what they call emotion
I see she feels pity of me

And on this river of silence Iâm traveling to the dark
(Iâm traveling through the dark and I)
See a face in the distance that waits for me to come (that waits for me to come)
And everything around is so deep and strong
In the end when all seems to drown in the sand!
