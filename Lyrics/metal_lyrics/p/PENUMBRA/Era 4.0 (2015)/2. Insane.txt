I wonder if Iâm insane
Is their life a kind of comedy?
Habits are for me worse than hell
I like to succumb to a spell

No dream in sight
No fear
Just a way to follow
No dream in sight
No fear
Only lies to... Only lies to swallow

Touch your passion
Forget the reason
Caress your vices
And make them a fairy goal
The conflicts which build both soul and heart
Please hear them
Before ending in oblivion

This is all you... This is all you get
Lies are only... Lies are all you let
All the wishes you made are born to fail
Shame to undergo
Just a way to... A way to follow

Life is for them conceptual
with guidelines to share between them all

Why donât you see in life shelter
Give an aim and go to another side?

Am I insane?
Do I live in a cell?

You know that your way has already been designed?

Am I insane if I see in the life a tragical play?
Am I insane if I accept all my dualities?
Am I insane if I refuse to pray in vain?
And to take nothing at face value?
