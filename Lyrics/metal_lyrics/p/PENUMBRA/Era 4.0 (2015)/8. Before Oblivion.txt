[Sample:]
If this evil force can be stopped and destroyed
Before actual nuclear war begins
Then the universe will be saved

Come to this appalling assumption
It tends to fall in oblivion
But why should it be so absurd?
Think about your last words

No words, no time for any regrets
Nothing for what I have not done yet
I'll face a rain of mixed pictures
Which ones of them are my treasures?
Time will be for the essence
Life can be a maze but I have thought of you all days

In every sound, I can hear your whisper
Anywhere I see my lover
How to go through life on its own
Rejoin the darkness all alone?

You have a broken heart
But things can turn around
There is nothing left at all
Nobody anywhere
I learn death on my own
Now I fave the rule of existence

When the world will go out
I'll take with me your precious name
And clouds will draw your beautiful and smiling face
I'll kiss death with a heated heart
In the reign of the flames
I'll take with me your lovely name
I know without any doubt that you'll do the same
I will die with serenity

Hey come on death, take me away
I bring with me my jewel
Come on death, take me away
The life was also cruel

Please, tell me that in your world of chaos
I'll remember her face
I'll offer you my servility
You could grind my soul

Shall I say that you already know?
I'd be ready to be sacrificed
You know you are the only one
Who owned my mind and my heart

I really take pity on those who missed passion
Just for a wretched and pathetic redemption

Winds will caress my hair
While fire will kiss my skin
My glance toward the west
I will look at an inexistent sun
And I would probably yell

When the world will go out
I'll take with me your precious name
And clouds will draw your beautiful and smiling face
I'll kiss death with a heated heart
In the reign of the flames
I'll take with me your lovely name
I know without any doubt that you'll do the same
I will die with serenity

Hey come on death, take me away
I bring with me my jewel
Come on death, take me away
The life was also cruel
