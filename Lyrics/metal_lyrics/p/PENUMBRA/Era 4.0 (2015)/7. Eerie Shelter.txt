Iâm haunted by something Iâm not really able to define
Within the light, a call, itâs so divine
And his eyes in front of me are like ????
And my soul just fights to know

Take care of the lives you take
They give a sense to your existence
I feel your anger, your betrayal
Donât close your eyes in this way
Get away and run away, power is a prison
Like cyanide through your veins
It burns you forever... (forever and ever)

I want to know if the end is near
Though I will feel myself with their hidden fears
And do the only souls I can breed
Show me the key of what I am vowed to be

Who will know what I have to see?
What you really want from me?
Within the light a void is inviting me now
Who else can hear my call?

They will try to have you fall
Like no one else they all envy you
They want to leave your burnt soul
In this garden of vices
Get away and run away
Go straight never come back
Youâre entirely in their hands
It burns you forever... (forever and ever)

I want to know if the end is near
Though I will feel myself with their hidden fears
And do the only souls I can breed
Show me the key of what I am vowed to be

This is what they want
So pure so bright
Here is such a frost, so sad
They talk about you

In immortal soul
Youâll seek safety
Keep your human life
Maybe it will save you

The keeper told youâre immortal
Why do you think I give you this choice?
Far away from your deepest desires
Trying to light off the candle and wish me to die

Do you feel the tears on your lips?
Itâs your heart that you condemned
Far away from your deepest desires
Ride alone into the night... into the night...

Far away from all these shores
A thousand candles on the floor
Crimson silk and velvet tense
The candleâs keeper awaits me there
All these lights for all these lives
They took my fate, erase my past
Who is this strange, I cannot I see
Behind the veil of tragedy?
