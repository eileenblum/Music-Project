Crazy girl, you just have to smile 
Show your legs, turn them blind 
Kill' em all, you're afraid 
Cause they are still alive 

[CHORUS]

Turn them off 
Make them smell your 
Flesh just to see their eyes 
Bring them to your death 
Crazy girl, crazy faith 

Let your body speak 
Open it like a door 
Slave them with your breath 
Crazy girl, crazy death 

Life is a masquerade 
Angel of love is a devil 
Reality is so sad 
Why's your hate so strong
