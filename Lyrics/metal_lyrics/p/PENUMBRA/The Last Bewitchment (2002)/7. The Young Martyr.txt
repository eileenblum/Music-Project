I remember 
Your heavenly face underwater
Admiring its whiteness 
Under the moon rays 
And the life going out 
Of your magnificent wounds
Wraps up of red your naked flesh

On your pearly nails, the subdued light
Gleam under water in a deep silence
And your veins, in a complexe network
Draw on your skin tree roots

You who sleep for ever 
In your cold shroud
Shall the disgrace fall on 
Your holy misfortune

Which sentences for its crime
Your suicided spirit
And puts on its face
An accusing appearance

You, who sleep for ever 
In your cold shroud
Shall the disgrace fall on 
Your holy misfortune

Your dark hair, as an oil slick
Stays on the surface, refusing to sink
It tries to make believe of a last hope
It dances on the waves, unlifed, unlifed
