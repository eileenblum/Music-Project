Paternal affection escapes youInstead you are riddled with sadistic desires Seeking control through intentional harmHow could you be so callousTo crush a life so pure, your own sonNow severally deformedYour own son now severally deformed Under my rules you would cease to existAlong with the rest of you pricksUnder my rules you would cease to existAlong with the rest of you pricks Terminate the perpetratorsTerminate the perpetratorsTerminate, terminate the perpetrators Roll up, roll upLet the downfall comence, inflict pain so callousThat blood pours from every orificeEvery orifice Roll up, roll upLet the downfall comence, inflict pain so callousThat blood pours from every orificeEvery orifice Paternal affection escapes youInstead you are riddled with sadistic desiresDesires.From every orifice Watch your breath as your body shuts downHell awaits you, and revenge feels fucking sweet Revenge feels fucking sweet
