YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED 
TO THE MASTERS OF YOUR MIND 
THEY TELL YOU STORIES 
THAT CAN TWIST YOU UP INSIDE 
THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE 
THAT KEEPS IT MOVING ON 
HAS TAKEN ALL YOUR STRENGTH 
HOW COULD YOU BE SO WRONG 

THERE'S A LONGING, 
AND DEEP INSIDE IT'S JUSTIFIED 
AND YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH, 
SO HOLD OUT YOUR HAND 

ALL THE STARS ABOVE YOUR HEAD 
DRIVING YOU TO BE MISLEAD 
FOLLOWED BY THE THE MOON TO GUIDE THE WAY 
WALK BENEATH A PAINTED SKY 
TEARS AND RAINDROPS FLOOD YOUR EYES 
FOLLOWED BY THE THE MOON TO GUIDE THE WAY 
TO GUIDE THE WAY 

LIKE ALL THE STAGES OF THE CHILDISH MASQUERADE 
LIKE ALL THE SEASONS 
THEY CAN NEVER BE THE SAME 
LET IT TAKE YOU BACK 
TO THE PLACE YOU NEW BEFORE 
A LOT OF PAIN INSIDE BUT IT SHOULDN'T HURT NO MORE 

THERE'S A LONGING, 
AND DEEP INSIDE IT'S JUSTIFIED 
AND YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH, 
SO HOLD OUT YOUR HAND 

ALL THE STARS ABOVE YOUR HEAD 
DRIVING YOU TO BE MISLEAD 
FOLLOWED BY THE THE MOON TO GUIDE THE WAY 
WALK BENEATH A PAINTED SKY 
TEARS AND RAINDROPS FLOOD YOUR EYES 
FOLLOWED BY THE THE MOON TO GUIDE THE WAY 

YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED 
NOW YOU'RE MISLEAD 
INTO SUBMISSION 
IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD 
IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD 

ALL THE STARS ABOVE YOUR HEAD 
DRIVING YOU TO BE MISLEAD 
FOLLOWED BY THE THE MOON TO GUIDE THE WAY 
WALK BENEATH A PAINTED SKY 
TEARS AND RAINDROPS FLOOD YOUR EYES 
FOLLOWED BY THE THE MOON TO GUIDE THE WAY 
TO GUIDE THE WAY
