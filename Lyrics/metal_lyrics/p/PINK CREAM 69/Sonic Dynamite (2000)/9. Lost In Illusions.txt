HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU UNDERSTAND? 
HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU MAKE AMENDS? 
HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU HIDE YOUR PAIN? 
STANDING IN THE RAIN 
RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR SANITY 
OPEN THE DOOR THAT MAKES YOUR MIND BELIEVE 
SHYING AWAY FROM A LOADED GUN 
AIMING FOR THE SUN 

LOST IN ILLUSIONS 
IT'S YOUR REALITY 
HOW DOES IT FEEL WHEN YOU FACE THE CONFUSION? 
LOST IN ILLUSIONS 
WHAT DO YOU WANNA BE 
THEY WILL DECLARE YOU A THREAT TO SOCIETY 

HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU LIVE THOSE LIES? 
PLAYING THE BIG SHOT IN A BLINDMAN'S EYES 
SPILLING THE BLOOD TO MARK THE GROUNDS YOU RULE 
DON'T YOU PLAY THE FOOL 
DRESSING YOURSELF FOR YOUR DIGNITY 
WALKING THE STREETS THAT MAKE YOU THINK YOU'RE FREE 
WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN THE WELL RUNS DRY 
KISS YOUR ASS GOODBYE 

LOST IN ILLUSIONS 
IT'S YOUR REALITY 
HOW DOES IT FEEL WHEN YOU FACE THE CONFUSION? 
LOST IN ILLUSIONS 
WHAT DO YOU WANNA BE 
THEY WILL DECLARE YOU A THREAT 
A THREAT TO SOCIETY, A THREAT TO SOCIETY 
A THREAT TO SOCIETY, A THREAT TO SOCIETY 

YOUR OUT OF CONTROL 
SO WATCH WHAT YOUR DOING 
AND OPEN YOUR EYES 
THE DANGER IS IN DISGUISE 

LOST IN ILLUSIONS 
IT'S YOUR REALITY 
HOW DOES IT FEEL WHEN YOU FACE THE CONFUSION? 
LOST IN ILLUSIONS 
WHAT DO YOU WANNA BE 
THEY WILL DECLARE YOU A THREAT 
A THREAT TO SOCIETY, A THREAT TO SOCIETY 
A THREAT TO SOCIETY, A THREAT TO SOCIETY
