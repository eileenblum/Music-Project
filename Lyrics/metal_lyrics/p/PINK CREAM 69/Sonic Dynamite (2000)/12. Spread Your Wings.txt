OFF INTO A PLACE WHERE EVERY SPIRIT HAS TO GO 
SEE THE LINES UPON THEIR FACES TROUBLED BY THE FLOW 
LISTEN TO THE DISTANT THUNDER 
CLAIMING ALL THE SKY 
NOW WE ALL SHOULD REALIZE 
NO ONE ANSWER 
NO ONE REASON WHY 

SPREAD YOUR WINGS 
AND LEAVE YOUR WORRIES BEHIND 
LIGHT THE FLAME 
THAT GUIDES THE WAY THROUGH YOUR MIND 
SHOW YOUR WILL 
THAT WRITE THE STORIES UNTOLD 
SPREAD YOUR WINGS 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND 
NOTHING MORE, YOU WILL FIND 

ONCE YOU WERE A PRISONER 
BUT NOW YOUR FREE AT LAST 
BINDED BY THE DARKNESS AND THE DEMONS OF YOUR PAST 
FEEL THE MAGIC RISE WITHIN THE DEEPNESS OF YOUR HEART 
STONE FOR STONE YOU BUILT YOUR FORTRESS 
NOW THEY'VE COME ,TO TEAR IT ALL APART 

SPREAD YOUR WINGS 
AND LEAVE YOUR WORRIES BEHIND 
LIGHT THE FLAME 
THAT GUIDES THE WAY THROUGH YOUR MIND 
SHOW YOUR WILL 
THAT WRITE THE STORIES UNTOLD 
SPREAD YOUR WINGS 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND 
NOTHING MORE, YOU WILL FIND 

BLINDED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE'S 
SHADOWING THE LIGHT 
REMINDED BY THE UNFORGIVEN 
LOST UPON THE FLIGHT 
DESTINY IS LONG IN MAKING 
SOME HAVE BEEN SO SHY 
NOW WE ALL SHOULD REALIZE 
NO ONE ANSWER, NO ONE REASON WHY 

SPREAD YOUR WINGS 
AND LEAVE YOUR WORRIES BEHIND 
LIGHT THE FLAME 
THAT GUIDES THE WAY THROUGH YOUR MIND 
SHOW YOUR WILL 
THAT WRITE THE STORIES UNTOLD 
SPREAD YOUR WINGS 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND 
NOTHING MORE, YOU WILL FIND 
SO LEAVE YOUR WORRIES BEHIND 
SPREAD YOUR WINGS
