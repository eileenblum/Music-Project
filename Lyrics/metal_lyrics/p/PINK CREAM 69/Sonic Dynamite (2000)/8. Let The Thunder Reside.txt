CLOSE MY EYES AND FALL TO SLEEP BENEATH THE SKY 
IN THE STILLNESS OF MY DREAMS I WILL CONFIDE 
EVERY DAY I'M LOOSING FAITH TO CARRY ON 
BUT THE INSTINCT OF A MAN IS MUCH TOO STRONG 

WE ARE PAWNS OF THE GAMES 
MAKING HISTORY 
AND THE SOUND MAKES YOU CRUMBLE 
TO YOUR KNEES 

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE 
THAT EVERYTHING I SEE 
IS TEARING UP MY SOUL 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 

THE RINGING IN MY EARS 
AWAKENS ALL MY FEARS 
NOWHERE LEFT TO HIDE 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 

I AWAKE WITH HOPES THE GAME HAD REACHED AN END 
NO MORE HURTING OF A WORLD ON WHICH WE DEPEND 
YES, WE KNOW THE TRUTH CAN HURT US SO WE'RE BLIND 
BUT DOES THE JUSTICE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE UNKIND? 

WE ARE PAWNS OF THE GAMES 
MAKING HISTORY 
AND THE SOUND MAKES YOU CRUMBLE 
TO YOUR KNEES 

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE 
THAT EVERYTHING I SEE 
IS TEARING UP MY SOUL 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 

THE RINGING IN MY EARS 
AWAKENS ALL MY FEARS 
NOWHERE LEFT TO HIDE 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 

THERES A REASON TO LIVE 
THERES A REASON TO DIE 
THERES A REASON FOR CHANGE 
LET THE THUNDER FADE AWAY INTO FORGOTTEN YESTERDAY 
LET THE SILENCE BRING US PEACE FOR WHICH WE PRAY 
THE TIME HAS COME TO MAKE ANOTHER START 
AND TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS IN MY HEART 

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE 
THAT EVERYTHING I SEE 
IS TEARING UP MY SOUL 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 

THE RINGING IN MY EARS 
AWAKENS ALL MY FEARS 
NOWHERE LEFT TO HIDE 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 

THERES A REASON TO LIVE 
THERES A REASON TO DIE 
THERES A REASON TO GIVE 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 
THERES A REASON TO LIVE 
THERES A REASON TO DIE 
THERES A REASON TO GIVE 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE 
LET THE THUNDER RESIDE
