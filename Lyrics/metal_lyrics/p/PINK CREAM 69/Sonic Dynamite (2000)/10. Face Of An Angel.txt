LOOKING FOR THE ANSWER 
TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DAY 
LOOKING FOR FORGIVENESS 
FOR THE GAMES YOU'VE PLAYED 
NEVER NEW THE REASON 
FOR DOING WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
HONESTY BETRAYS YOU 
AND THE TRUTH IS OVERRUN 

HOW CAN YOU LIE INTO THE FACE OF AN ANGEL? 
AND NOW YOU'RE HIDING ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE 
HOW CAN YOU LOOK IN THOSE EYES? 
AND NEVER EVEN REALIZE 
YOUR GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN 
I GUESS THE WORLD IS GOING DOWN 

FEELING LIKE A STRANGER 
LEFT YOU SO ALONE 
STILL NOT OUT OF DANGER 
STORIES HAVE BEEN TOLD 
THERE'S NO USE DENYING 
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE BLAME 
ALL THESE YEARS OF LYING 
WILL SHE EVER BE THE SAME? 

HOW CAN YOU LIE INTO THE FACE OF AN ANGEL? 
AND NOW YOU'RE HIDING ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE 
HOW CAN YOU LOOK IN THOSE EYES 
AND NEVER EVEN REALIZE 
YOUR GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN 
I GUESS THE WORLD IS GOING DOWN 

JUST WOKE UP, FROM MY DREAM 
I HEARD HER CRY 
I HEARD HER SCREAM 
DOES SHE HAVE TO SUFFER? 
TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND 
THERE CAN BE NO OTHER 
AND THAT'S THE WAY SHE STANDS 
TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK 
BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY 
WHAT A CHANCE YOU TOOK 
NOW SHE'S GONE,GONE,GONE 
NOW SHE'S GONE,GONE,GONE 
GOT YOU ON YOUR KNEES 

HOW CAN YOU LIE INTO THE FACE OF AN ANGEL? 
AND NOW YOU'RE HIDING ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE 
HOW CAN YOU LOOK IN THOSE EYES 
AND NEVER EVEN REALIZE 
YOUR GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN 
HOW CAN YOU LIE INTO THE FACE OF AN ANGEL? 
AND NOW YOU'RE HIDING ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE 
HOW CAN YOU LOOK IN THOSE EYES 
AND NEVER EVEN REALIZE 
YOUR GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN 
I GUESS THE WORLD IS GOING DOWN
