LISTEN AND YOU WILL BELIEVE 
ECHOES OF SCREAMING TO GIVE YOU GLORY 
MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER CONCEIVE 
THUNDERING WALLS GONNA TELL THE STORY 
SHUT DOWN THE LIGHTS 
RELEASE THE MIGHT 
TENSION HANGS THICK IN THE AIR 
WE GOT THE MEANS 
SO BREAK AT THE SEAMS 
FEELING THE POWER YOU BEAR 

STAND UP, THE MOMENT IS RIGHT 
WE'RE GONNA TEAR THROUGH THOSE WALLS 
HOLD ON, THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT 
LET THE MUSIC BITE 
THE SONIC DYNAMITE 
LET'S LIGHT IT 
THE SONIC DYNAMITE 

LIKE A FIRE WE CAN RISE AND FALL 
THROUGH THE MADNESS WE CAN TAKE IT ALL 
POWERED BY THE FORCE YOU GIVE TO ME 
GOT THE MAKINGS FOR A UNITY 

NOW THAT I KNOW THAT I 
AIN'T GOT NO TIME LEFT TO WASTE 
COME ON AND WITNESS THE FINAL FURY 
YOU ARE THE NEW FOUNDED RACE 
SURRENDER YOUR MIND WHEN 
YOU FACE THE JURY 
OPEN YOUR EYES 
SEE NO DISGUISE 
MYSTICAL MAGIC WILL RISE 
NOW YOU CAN FLY 
SO, LETS HAVE A TRY 
KNOWING THERE'LL BE NO SUPRISE 

STAND UP, THE MOMENT IS RIGHT 
WE'RE GONNA TEAR THROUGH THOSE WALLS 
HOLD ON, THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT 
LET THE MUSIC BITE 

THE SONIC DYNAMITE 
LET'S LIGHT IT 
THE SONIC DYNAMITE 
DON'T FIGHT IT 
THE SONIC DYNAMITE 
THE SONIC DYNAMITE 
THE SONIC DYNAMITE
