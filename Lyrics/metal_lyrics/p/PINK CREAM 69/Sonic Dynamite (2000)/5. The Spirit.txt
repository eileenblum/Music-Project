I NEVER HAD A REASON 
TO REGRET THE PATH I CHOSE 
I'M DRIVEN BY CHANGING SEASONS 
THE ONE THING THAT NOBODY KNOWS 

THERE WERE SOME COMPROMISES 
TOO LATE TO REPRIMAND 
SEE THROUGH THIS WORN DISGUISE 
I'LL BE WEARING UNTIL THE END 

LOOK AT THE SMILE THEY PAINTED ON MY FACE 
HIDING THE TRUTH YOU KNOW I'M FAR FROM GRACE 
TURNING THE PAGES OF THE WORDS I'VE SAID 
BUT THE PASSION WILL NEVER BE GONE 
THE SPIRIT GOES ON 

I HOPE THIS WILL LAST FOREVER 
TO BE IN THIS PARADISE 
SUBCONSIOUSLY HOLDS ME TOGETHER 
I DON'T NEED NO COLD ADVICE 

THERE WERE SOME COMPROMISES 
TOO LATE TO REPRIMAND 
SEE THROUGH THIS WORN DISGUISE 
I'LL BE WEARING UNTIL THE END 

LOOK AT THE SMILE THEY PAINTED ON MY FACE 
HIDING THE TRUTH YOU KNOW I'M FAR FROM GRACE 
TURNING THE PAGES OF THE WORDS I'VE SAID 
BUT THE PASSION WILL NEVER BE GONE 
THE SPIRIT GOES ON 

BY THE FIRELIGHT I STARE INTO THE NIGHT 
THAT LOOKS DOWN ON ME 
AND IT'S CALLING ME TO CARRY ON THIS PLIGHT 
LET THE SPIRIT FLY AWAY 
I NEVER HAD A REASON 
TO REGRET THE PATH I CHOSE 
I'M DRIVEN BY CHANGING SEASONS 
THE ONE THING THAT NOBODY KNOWS 

TOO MANY COMPROMISES 
I DONT WANT TO REPRIMAND 
MORE THAN A THIN DISGUISE 
I'LL BE HOLDING ON TILL THE END 

LOOK AT THE SMILE THEY PAINTED ON MY FACE 
HIDING THE TRUTH YOU KNOW I'M FAR FROM GRACE 
TURNING THE PAGES OF THE WORDS I'VE SAID 
BUT THE PASSION WILL NEVER BE GONE NO 
LOOK AT THE SMILE THEY PAINTED ON MY FACE 
HIDING THE TRUTH YOU KNOW I'M FAR FROM GRACE 
TURNING THE PAGES OF THE WORDS I'VE SAID 
BUT THE PASSION WILL NEVER BE GONE 
THE SPIRIT GOES ON 
THE SPIRIT GOES ON 
MY SPIRIT GOES ON
