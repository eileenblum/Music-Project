THROW AWAY THE KEY 
NOTHING ELSE CAN SET ME FREE 
CHAIN ME TO MY SOUL 
ACCOMPLISH OF THE CRIMES THEY'VE TOLD 
THE DAY WILL NEVER COME 
WHEN I SEE THE RISING SUN 
ON A ROTTING BED 
FORGOTTEN SINS RUN THROUGH MY HEAD 

IF I COULD BE PART OF THAT 
WORLD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW 
IF I COULD BE FORGIVEN 

FOREVER IN A RUSTY CAGE 
FOREVER I CONCEAL THIS RAGE 
ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WILL SOON BE GONE 
ALONE IN SILENCE WAITING FOR THE DAWN 

STEP INTO MY MIND 
TELL ME OF THE THINGS YOU FIND 
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND 
I'M NO LONGER IN COMMAND 
FORGIVEN I WON'T BE 
A GUILTY MAN THAT'S ALL THEY SEE 
SHADDOWS ON THE WALL 
COUNT THE SECONDS TILL THEY FALL 

IF I COULD BE PART OF THAT 
WORLD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW 
IF I COULD BE FORGIVEN 

FOREVER IN A RUSTY CAGE 
FOREVER I CONCEAL THIS RAGE 
ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WILL SOON BE GONE 
MY ONLY CHOICE IS TO GO ON 
FOREVER IN A RUSTY CAGE 
FOREVER I CONCEAL THIS RAGE 
ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WILL SOON BE GONE 
ALONE IN SILENCE WAITING FOR THE DAWN 

NO ESCAPE 
BINDED BY THE FORCE 
MY HEART ACES 
WON'T YOU SET ME FREE 

IF I COULD BE PART OF THAT 
WORLD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW 
IF I COULD BE FORGIVEN 
BUT I'M JUST LIVIN.. 

FOREVER IN A RUSTY CAGE 
FOREVER I CONCEAL THIS RAGE 
ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WILL SOON BE GONE 
MY ONLY CHOICE IS TO GO ON 
FOREVER IN A RUSTY CAGE 
FOREVER I CONCEAL THIS RAGE 
ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WILL SOON BE GONE 
ALONE IN SILENCE WAITING FOR THE DAWN 

I'M WAITING FOR THE DAWN 
I'M WAITING FOR THE DAWN
