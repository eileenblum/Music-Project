WELL THE CHILDREN OF TOMORROW 
ARE KNOCKING DOWN YOUR DOOR 
AND SCREAMING OUT 
THE WORDS YOU HEARD BEFORE 
WE ARE LIVING WITH THE SORROW 
THE PAIN WILL BE NO MORE 
THE TIDE CAN DRAG YOU DOWN 
OR BACK TO SHORE 

I TOOK A RIDE INTO THE FUTURE 
IT PULLED ME UNDER 
AND IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY 

SEAS OF MADNESS 
THE NIGHT WILL GUIDE THE WAY 
YOU'RE BREAKING OUT 
FROM THIS MASQUERADE 
SEAS OF MADNESS 
WHEN WILL THEY UNDERSTAND? 
YOU'VE WASHED AWAY 
CIRCLES IN THE SAND 
CIRCLES IN THE SAND 

NOW YOUR PULLING BACK THE CURTAINS 
THAT ONCE CONCEALED YOUR MIND 
FACE THE TRUTH YOU'VE LIVED AND WASTED TIME 
THINGS ARE VERY CERTAIN 
LOOK AND YOU WILL FIND 
YEARS HAVE PASSED YOU BY CAUSE YOU WERE BLIND 

I TOOK A RIDE INTO THE FUTURE 
IT PULLED ME UNDER 
AND IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY 

SEAS OF MADNESS 
THE NIGHT WILL GUIDE THE WAY 
YOU'RE BREAKING OUT 
FROM THIS MASQUERADE 
SEAS OF MADNESS 
WHEN WILL THEY UNDERSTAND 
YOU'VE WASHED AWAY 
CIRCLES IN THE SAND 
IN THE SAND 

AND NOW THEY'VE TAKEN ALL YOUR WISDOM 
AND LEFT YOU NOW WITH INDECISION 
DON'T LET THEM STEAL THE AIR YOU'RE BREATHING 
YOUR GONNA' SAIL AWAY FOREVER 

I TOOK A RIDE INTO THE FUTURE 
AND WHAT IT SHOWED ME WAS MY PAST 
THE OCEAN WAITS FOR MY SURRENDER 
IT PULLS ME UNDER 
AND IT TAKES MY BREATH AWAY 

SEAS OF MADNESS 
THE NIGHT WILL GUIDE THE WAY 
YOU'RE BREAKING OUT 
FROM THIS MASQUERADE 
SEAS OF MADNESS 
WHEN WILL THEY UNDERSTAND 
YOU' VE WASHED AWAY 
CIRCLES IN THE SAND 
CIRCLES IN THE SAND 
WILL YOU EVER UNDERSTAND? 
CIRCLES IN THE SAND 
WILL YOU EVER UNDERSTAND? 
CIRCLES IN THE SAND 
MADNESS
