It's the night I'll be with you 
Lovely to see you , lovely to hear you 
You're TV-acting pulls me through 
Side by side I dreamt to be with you 
It's been a long time that you've been gone 
I wanted for you longing to tell you 
I have missed you for so long 
Side by side I dreamt to be with you 
Only with you 

Looks like one step into paradise 
Silver screen lights in my eyes 
One step into paradise 
So close before my eyes 

I've seen you fighting for the truth 
Creatures of danger, voices of strangers 
A hard and obtained crew 
Side by side I dreamt to fight with you 
Only with you 

Looks like one step into paradise 
Silver screen lights in my eyes 
One step into paradise 
So close before my eyes 
Looks like one step into paradise 
Looks like pictures of paradise 
Pictures of paradise 

You play the clown, you play the fool 
Nobody's asking if tears are only tools 
I've seen you playing my own rules 
Side by side I dreamt to play with you 
Only with you 

Looks like one step into paradise 
Silver screen lights on my eyes 
One step into paradise 
So close before my eyes 
Just like pictures of paradise 
I wanna hear it again 
Looks like one step into paradise
