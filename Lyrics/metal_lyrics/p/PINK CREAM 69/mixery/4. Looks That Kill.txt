[Motley Crue cover]

Now listen up 
She's razor sharp 
If she don't get her way 
She'll slice you apart 
Now she's a cool, cool black 
Moves like a cat 
If you don't get her game 
You might not make it back 

Pre chorus: 
She's got the looks that kill 
That kill 
She's got the looks that kill 
That kill 

She's got the looks that kill 

Now she's bulletproof 
Keeps her motor clean 
And believe me, you 
She's a number thirteen 
The church strikes midnight 
She's lookin' louder and louder 
She's gonna turn on our juice, boy 
So she turns on the power 

She's got the looks that kill 
That kill 
She's got the looks that kill 
That kill 

She's got the looks that kill 

Now listen up 
She's razor sharp 
If she don't get her way 
She'll slice you apart 
Now she's a cool, cool black 
Moves like a cat 
If you don't get her game 
You might not make it back 

She's got the looks that kill 
That kill 
She's got the looks that kill 
That kill 

She's got the looks that kill
