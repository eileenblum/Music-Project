opened up my eyes and saw the sky 
over meadows where i lie 
then i heard the children cry 
in my sleep i saw a distant light 
it arose and left in flight 
then the shadows faded to white 
in the night 

Why should everybody have to pay? 
shame on you, shame on me 
is there any place to hide away? 
blame it on humanity 
Why should everybody have to pay? 
shame on you, shame on me 
will our children have a say? 

field of sand exposed under the sun 
where a river used to run 
would it ever be undone? 
hide the wounds that we tried to heal in time 
with our power so divine 
such an unforgiven crime 
such a crime 

Why should everybody have to pay? 
shame on you, shame on me 
is there any place to hide away? 
blame it on humanity 
Why should everybody have to pay? 
shame on you, shame on me 
will our children have a say? 

are you ready? 
it won't be long until we know 
are you ready? 

Why should everybody have to pay? 
shame on you, shame on me 
is there any place to hide away? 
blame it on humanity 
Why should everybody have to pay? 
shame on you, shame on me 
is there any place to hide away? 
blame it on humanity 
you should have known better
