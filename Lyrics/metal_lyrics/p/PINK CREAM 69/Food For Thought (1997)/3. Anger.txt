Ask me something i don't know
help to make me whole
give the one thing that i need
cause i need to gain control

in don't know but I've been told
something's on your mind
i won't criticize if you tell me the deal
but there's a monkey on your back
and it's sucking out your pride

cause I feel your anger
i can sense your hate is working overdrive
yeah i feel your anger
can't you realize it's eating you alive

hit the breaks, yeah you're much too fast
the hatred takes it's toll
maybe what you need is a smack in the head
but there's a monkey on your back
and it's sucking out your pride

cause I feel your anger
i can sense your hate is working overdrive
yeah i feel your anger
can't you realize it's eating you alive

i guess you're getting nowhere
i feel... i feel... i feel
i guess you're getting nowhere
i feel... i feel... i feel
Tell me what have you got
and what do you need ?
Tell me what have you got
and what do you need ?

cause I feel your anger
i can sense your hate is working overdrive
yeah i feel your anger
can't you realize it's eating you alive
cause I feel your anger
i can sense your hate is working overdrive
yeah i feel your anger

Tell me what have you got
and what do you need ?
