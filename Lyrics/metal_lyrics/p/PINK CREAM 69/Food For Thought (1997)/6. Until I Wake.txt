i know another wrong won't make it right
i know another drink won't keep my senses clean
put a gun up to my head, might stop me for a while
i know another shot could get me through the night

but i feel my anger, and I'm so unstable
and i want to hold back, but I'm just not able
so i found redemption in a long white bottle
could it be I'm desperate? when it keeps me calm...

until I wake

i need another way to get me loose
i need another way to let my thoughts go free
can't you understand that I'm a complicated man ?
i need another shot before i tie my noose

but i feel my anger, and I'm so unstable
and i want to hold back, but I'm just not able
so i found redemption in a long white bottle
could it be I'm desperate? when it keeps me calm...

Until I wake, until i wake

hey yeah.... it's my mind, yeah... it's my way, yeah
and it comforts me, yes it comforts me
But i never - felt at ease
and I'm on my - bended knees
and nothing can - stop me now
cause I'm loaded...

could i learn my lesson? can't you feel my anger

break me, can't make me,
believe me, yeah !!!

But I feel my anger, but i feel my anger
but i feel my anger, i feel so alone...

but i feel my anger, and I'm so unstable
and i want to hold back, but I'm just not able
so i found redemption in a long white bottle
could it be I'm desperate? when it keeps me calm...

Until I wake, until i wake...
