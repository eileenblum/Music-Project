[David Readman - Alfred Koffler - Dennis Ward - Kosta Zafiriou]

See a light
Not a phonic sound or a soul around
Isolation
I'm gonna do my time

I'm on the other side
The other side

Block out my anger
I tried to push and shove my way above
I surrender
I found my hidden peace

I'm on the other side
The other side
I'm on the other side
The other side

Fly, leave the world behind you
Dive out of the greed of mankind

See the light
Don't let it shine, leave my fears behind
Nothing can shake me
I'm no longer scared

Fly, leave the world behind you
Dive out of the greed of mankind

I'm on the other side
The other side
I'm on the other side
The other side
I'm on the other side

I found that phonic sound
I found not a soul around
I'm gonna let it shine
Leave all my fears behind
Block out my anger
Block out my anger
I've found my way above
I surrender

I'm on the other side
