My mind is screaming
My head is dreaming
My eyes don't sense reality
Sometimes i loose it
or i confuse it
i fear for my mentality

but i don't know where to start
when the pain tears me apart
and i can't keep touch
when it gets too much

then I'll snap, snap
then I'll snap, snap

although i hate it
i can't deflate it
that ain't the way it oughta be
I know the seasons
I've tried to reason
the answer's right on front of me

but i don't know where to start
when the pain tears me apart
and i can't keep touch
when it gets too much

then I'll snap, snap
then I'll snap, snap

but i don't know where to start
when the pain tears me apart
and i can't keep touch
when it gets too much

then I'll snap, snap

but i don't know where to start
when the pain tears me apart
and i can't keep touch
when it gets too much
and i can't hold ground
could you pull me down

then I'll snap, snap
then I'll snap, snap
then I'll snap, snap
then I'll snap, snap
