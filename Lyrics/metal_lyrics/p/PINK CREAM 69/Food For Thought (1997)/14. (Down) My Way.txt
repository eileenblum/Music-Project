Why don't you go to a place
where i don't have to see your face tomorrow,
face tomorrow
i guess your bus is running late
i hate to say you can't have friends to borrow,
friends to borrow

it's hard to realize you only use me
and you can't hide behind your bold disguise
i guess you must be blind
cause you can't see inside of me

hey you
why are you messin' with me
are you trying to break me
with psychology
but i can't stand
the shit that you say
if you don't really need me
then don't you come down my way

You call me up right after school
you hope to find yourself a fool to guide you
a fool to guide you
i guess i got to let you down
you need to find another clown to help you
cause i won't help you

it's hard to realize you only use me
and you can't hide behind your bold disguise
i guess you must be blind
cause you can't see inside of me

hey you
why are you messin' with me
are you trying to break me
with psychology
but i can't stand
the shit that you say
if you don't really need me
then don't you come down my way

you raped my mind
i lost control
i guess you'll find
you're on your own

it's hard to realize you only use me
and you can't hide behind your bold disguise
i guess you must be blind
cause you can't see inside of me

hey you
why are you messin' with me
are you trying to break me
with psychology
but i can't stand
the shit that you say
if you don't really need me
then don't you come down my way
down my way down my way...
