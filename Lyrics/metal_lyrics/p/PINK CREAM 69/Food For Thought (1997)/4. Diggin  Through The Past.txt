expectation has become your plight
a loosing battle that you're not
prepared to fight
Infatuated in what lies ahead
convinced the future is hanging by a thread

you wonder why time passes by
(But) you never got a chance to fly
it's just another story told
a fear of growing old...

recolation, digging through the past
it give you comfort and you wish that it could last
so now you question how to coincide
the hard-earned wisdom with the carefree inner child

you wonder why time passes by
(But) you never got a chance to fly
it's just another story told
a fear of growing old...
you wonder why time passes by
(But) you never got a chance to fly
it's just another story told
a fear of growing old...

you tried to get the best of both worlds
you tried to have it all
you never had the feeling you'd be
heading for a fall
can't you see your bridges burning
the point of no return
there ain't no way to prophecies
something you should learn

you wonder why time passes by
(But) you never got a chance to fly
it's just another story told
a fear of growing old...
you wonder why time passes by
(But) you never got a chance to fly
it's just another story told
a fear of growing old...
