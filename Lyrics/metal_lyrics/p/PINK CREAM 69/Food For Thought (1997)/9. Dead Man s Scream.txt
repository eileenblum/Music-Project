One man's dream
gonna make the news tonight
One man's dream
gonna justify their plight
hear his voice
breaking through the underground
sad but true

it's gonna shake you
ooh, have you ever heard a

Dead man's scream, dead man's scream
a wailing cry of the one man's dream
it breaks you down, down to your knees
don't try to feed me animosity

Dead man's scream, dead man's scream
a wailing cry of the one man's dream
it breaks you down, down to your knees
don't try to feed me animosity

signed his name,
left his mark across the land
met his fate,
will they ever understand
gain control,
get it from the man inside
sad but true

it's gonna shake you
ooh, have you ever heard a

Dead man's scream, dead man's scream
a wailing cry of the one man's dream
it breaks you down, down to your knees
don't try to feed me animosity

Dead man's scream, dead man's scream
a wailing cry of the one man's dream
it breaks you down, down to your knees
don't try to feed me animosity

It's gonna break you
don't try to feed me animosity
don't try to feed me animosity
don't try to feed me animosity

Dead man's scream, dead man's scream
a wailing cry of the one man's dream
it breaks you down, down to your knees
don't try to feed me animosity

Dead man's scream, dead man's scream
a wailing cry of the one man's dream
it breaks you down, down to your knees
Into a dead man
