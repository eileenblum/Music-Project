I'm taking my time
cause I think I'm in line
and I'm hoping to find
that I'm not really blind
and i try to believe
that there's something for me
con you tell me the deal ?
do you know How I feel ?

Fly on
Out of the dark into the light
Move On
look at the stars and break into flight

I'm loosing my hold
on the things I was told
is there something to see ?
is there something for me ?
Should I know what they mean ?
There's a lot to be seen
Are they lying ?
They're lying ?

I want to be free
but I don't wanna be
like the others i know
i got something to show
so I'll try to believe
that there's something for me
could you tell me the deal ?
do you know how I feel ?

Fly on
Out of the dark into the light
Move On
look at the stars and break into flight
Fly on
Out of the dark into the light
Move On
look at the stars and break into flight

Gonna heal my broken wings
to break into the night

Fly on
Out of the dark into the light
Move On
look at the stars and break into flight
Fly on
Out of the dark into the light
Move On
look at the stars and break into flight
break into flight
break into flight

I'm taking my time
cause I think I'm in line
and I'm hoping to find...
