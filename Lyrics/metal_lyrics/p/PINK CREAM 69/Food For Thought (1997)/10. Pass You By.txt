I never Thought I'd be the One
Who could Say all this
It took so long to work it Out
I've wasted time, it seems I'm just
getting Older
When will i find what I'm about ?

Then one day, you say,
it's time to break away
and we'll fly so high
don't let life pass you by

so many times you've shown me
grace under pressure
You never tried to prove me wrong
I've got a ticket for the last
train to nowhere
Why should you have to tag along ?

Then one day, you say,
it's time to break away
and we'll fly so high
you've got to try before
the days just pass you by
the days just pass you by

Where will I go ? I lost my way now
Where will I go ? I lost my way now
Where Will i go ?

I never Thought I'd be the One
Who could Say all this
I had a chance but had no faith to realize

Then one day, you say,
it's time to break away
and we'll fly so high
you've got to try before
the days just pass you by
the days just pass you by
