[Queen cover]

Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playing in the street : "Gonna be a big man some day"
You've got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place
Singing

We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you

Buddy you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street: "Gonna take on the world some day"
You've got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will we will rock you
Sing it!
We will we will rock you

Buddy you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes; Gonna make you some peace some day
You've got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place!

We will we will rock you
Sing it
We will we will rock you
Every body
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you
Allright
