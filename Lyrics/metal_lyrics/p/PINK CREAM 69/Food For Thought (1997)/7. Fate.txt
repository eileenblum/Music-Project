Take a look at me, I'm getting higher
feeling kind of free, feed my desire
running with the devil, i don't regret it
longing for the time, when i finally get it

how many days before i meet my fate ?
how many times can i get away ?

jump into the wind, it's numbing my senses
will there be an end? am i defenseless ?
Maybe I'm a drifter, or am i assuming ?
how could i forget that I'm only human

how many days before i meet my fate ?
how many times can i get away ?
could it be wrong when it feels so right ?
how many times until i reach my ?
how many days until i meet my -

fate - what's gotten into you ?
take - what it's got to give you !
break - all the rules that limit you !
save - all the fuel that's driving you !

So I'm playing with fire
and i don't care if i burn
something to help me
cause i want it, i need it

hey look at me, I'm alive
take a look at me
take a look at me
hey look at me, I'm alive
feeling kind of free
feeling kind of free
Hey look at me, I'm alive

fate - what's gotten into you ?
take - what it's got to give you !
break - all the rules that limit you !
save - all the fuel that's driving you !

So I'm playing with fire
and i don't care if i burn

fate - what's gotten into you ?
take - what it's got to give you !
break - all the rules that limit you !
save - all the fuel that's driving you !

So I'm playing with fire
and i don't care if i burn
something to help me
when i find the urge
