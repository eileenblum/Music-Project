Thought I'd found me an angel
when she came into my life
tried to prove that i was the one
that could make her feel alright

i had to have her
ooh, but she wasn't very easy
i tried to tell her
ooh, but she never listened

ooh, oh, oh, I'm sorry baby
ooh, oh, oh, I'm sorry baby
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

So i gave her a portion
that would make her feel so fine
from her sleep she would not awake
now i know that she's mine

i had to hide her
ooh, so i stuck her in the basement
How could i tell her
ooh, now she'll never listen

ooh, oh, oh, I'm sorry baby
ooh, oh, oh, I'm sorry baby

I wish i could let her out
i wish we could walk about
i wish i could show her
i am the guy
who will never let love pass her by

ooh, oh, oh, I'm sorry baby
ooh, oh, oh, I'm sorry baby
