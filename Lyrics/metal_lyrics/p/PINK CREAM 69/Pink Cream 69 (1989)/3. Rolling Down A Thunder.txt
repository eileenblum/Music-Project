[Andi Deris]

Hear it roll in the night
Feel it bending aside
I'm on my way to you
Mountain - high dikes
Lift you over their spikes
That's what I'm going through
For you

I'm on my way to you
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way to you
Baby from far away

I'm rolling down a thunder
I'm rolling down a thunder

Could be wings, could be sheets
In the cold, in the heart
I'm on my way to you
I run off the time
I get up hit the line
That's what I'm going through
For you

I'm on my way to you
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way to you
Baby from far away

I'm rolling down a thunder
I'm rolling down a thunder

I'm rolling down
Down, down on the ground
