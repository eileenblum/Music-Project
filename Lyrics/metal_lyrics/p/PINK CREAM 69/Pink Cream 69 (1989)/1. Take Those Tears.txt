[Andi Deris]

It's not right to make me believe you
To see white though it's black to the eyes
It's so loud in my head
From things you have said
Don't try to drive me mad
Don't think I'm coming knock on your door
For you know I have now declared you war
I won't be crawling on the floor

Take those tears from your eyes
They taste like lies
Take those tears from your eyes

They taste like lies 

Out of search out of remembrance
Yeah I know just like I knew before
You have wrapped me in light
Made me go blind
No more you'll twist my mind
No do not have that look in your eyes
I cannot take no more of your lies
It's enough of your disguise

Take those tears from your eyes
They taste like lies
Take those tears from your eyes
They taste like lies
