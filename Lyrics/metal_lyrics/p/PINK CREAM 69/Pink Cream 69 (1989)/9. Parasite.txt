[Andi Deris]

I'll take your body
I'll beat in your heart
So never turn up your cards
Else I'll own your honey
Since I'm wearing your shoes
I'm blessed but that's the truth

I'm a man who loves money
So don't wasted my time
I'm a creature out of pride

I'll be your lover
But I won't be your friend
I'll suck you out till the end
You keep on touching me
And kissing me
Make love the whole night
By the dawn I'm your parasite

I'm a man who loves money
So don't wasted my time
I'm a creature out of pride

Parasite
Wants you right tonight
Parasite
