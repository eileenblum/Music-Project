[Andi Deris]

Once was written down a form
On a dark day it was torn
It was lost and never found
And there were rumours of cure
A magic crown could make hearts pure
But it was lost and never found

Shadows are falling
Falling on and on
Shadows are falling
Shadows hide the crown

Long forgotten tales have told
A crown changing stone to gold
It was lost and never found
Wise men said "Hate" stands for stone
So the meaning had been known

But it was lost and never found

Shadows are falling
Falling on and on
Shadows are falling
Shadows hide the crown

I wanna know what makes the world to go

Shadows are falling
Falling on and on
Shadows are falling
Shadows hide the crown

And the days will come and go
And the time will come to show
But it is lost and never found
