[Andi Deris]

Everybody knows
You ain't got a stone for a heart
Is that just the way it goes
Play your life play a new cards
Who can say it's wrong or right
In all we'll do
Everybody has gone through changes
Everybody rearranges

Hear you crying - I can't get enough
I hear you crying - sugar for love
Sweet is dying in the name of love
Enough's enough - sugar for love

Every word they say
It is just the voice of your heart
Can't you feel the final day
Everything may have a new start
Who will need an alibi for all we'll be

Everybody has gone through changes
Everybody rearranges

Hear you crying - I can't get enough
I hear you crying - sugar for love
Sweet is dying in the name of love
Enough's enough - sugar for love

I see you standing there tonight turn your head
And get my sight too your eyes are wrapped it
Shadows; no light comes shining through
Take your body like a tool, as long as you can
Feed the food

Everybody has gone through changes
Everybody rearranges

Hear you crying - I can't get enough
I hear you crying - sugar for love
Sweet is dying in the name of love
Enough's enough - sugar for love
