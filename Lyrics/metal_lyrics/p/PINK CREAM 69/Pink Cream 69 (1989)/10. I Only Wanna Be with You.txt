[Andi Deris]

All that I know is
Babe I've only seen you smile
But something captured me
By the look in your eyes
Lonely days are lonely nights
Missing you all through
Yeah baby it's you, yeah baby it's you

I only wanna be for you
I only wanna be in your heart
I only wanna be tonight in love
But we're apart

All that I know is
You are one and only for me
You're all a girl could be
It's easy to see
Though I hardly know of you
So crazy and so true
Yeah baby it's you, yeah baby it's you

I only wanna be for you
I only wanna be in your heart
I only wanna be tonight in love
But we're apart

All day, all night I'm missing you all through
So crazy and so true
Yeah baby it's you, yeah baby it's you

I only wanna be for you
I only wanna be in your heart
I only wanna be tonight in love
But we're apart
