[Andi Deris]

Who stands?
Who creeps?
Live and grow strong
All a heart beats for
Who bleeds?

For this makes your body
This makes your soul
You better hit the bottom row

Go hit the bottom row
Go hit the bottom row

Who has?
Who needs?
Dependency stays
Magesty feeds upon
Who eats on?

This makes your body
This makes your soul
This makes the money
This make the show
You better hit to grow

Go hit the bottom row
Go hit the bottom row
