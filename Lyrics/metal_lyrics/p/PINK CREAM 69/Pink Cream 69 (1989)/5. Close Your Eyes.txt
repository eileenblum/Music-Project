[Andi Deris / Dennis Ward]

Don't believe
All that you dream is just illusion
Don't believe
You look for things not made for you
You'll win in everything
But don't live in confusion
Some days will come alive
And dreams will turn to truth

Someone will be longing you baby
Someone's gonna come
Someone will be holding you baby
Keep your way, only keep confiding
The you'll be finding

Close your eyes
Let your dreams go flying
Close your eyes
Keeps your mind off crying
Close your eyes
When the day seems hazy
Close your eyes
If it drives you crazy

Someone will be longing you baby
Someone's gonna come
Someone will be holding you baby
Keep your way, only keep confiding
The you'll be finding

Close your eyes
Let your dreams go flying
Close your eyes
Keeps your mind off crying
Close your eyes
When the day seems hazy
Close your eyes
If it drives you crazy
