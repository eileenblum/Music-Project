[Andi Deris]

Know me
I am like you
Never I breathe
But I'm true
Come and see me
I am the light
I've never shone in the night
I'm a child
Teach me
I need to know
All of the things you've been shown
I am searching for truth
And I fight for my rights
You did lose

So look to the future, look for tomorrow
I'm a child of a 1000 sorrows
So look to the future, look for tomorrow
I'm a child of a 1000 sorrows

Come on tell me
Don't you lose
All that is worth for my youth
I am searching 
Searching for truth
To fight for my rights
You did lose

So look to the future, look for tomorrow
I'm a child of a 1000 sorrows
So look to the future, look for tomorrow
I'm a child of a 1000 sorrows

Look for the child, look for the child
