[Andi Deris / Alfred Koffler]

Listen I'd like to tell you a story
How to get from low to high
To get to a hundred from zero
I'm talking 'bout a man sleeping
Just let him grow and fly
Get to know your inner head
So come on boys wake him up

Are you around? Do you get that sound
Are you around? Let him go go
Are you around? Yeah, you are around
Watch out

Listen, like Mr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hide
You're missing no night
Just put on your mask by daylight
So come on boys wake him up

Are you around? Do you get that sound
Are you around? Let him go go
Are you around? Yeah, you are around
Watch out
