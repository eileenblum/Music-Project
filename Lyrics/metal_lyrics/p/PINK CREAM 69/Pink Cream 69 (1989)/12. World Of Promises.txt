[Andi Deris]

Baby, I have been waiting the whole time through
Now that it's coming true, I know
Love is you
So crazy I never thought it ran so deep
But now that you're in my mind, I know
Love is blind

There's a change in me
It all comes to show
There's a change in me
Cause nothing's to know

In a world of promises
Hearts bleed so fast
In a world of promises
Why can't it last

I tell you lady, it ain't so easy to play this game
But we wouldn't change the rules
Just by changing schools
Yeah, baby this time is much too short to say
That you will fall the best just by failing one test

There's a change in me
It all comes to show
There's a change in me
Cause nothing's to know

In a world of promises
Hearts bleed so fast
In a world of promises
Why can't it last
