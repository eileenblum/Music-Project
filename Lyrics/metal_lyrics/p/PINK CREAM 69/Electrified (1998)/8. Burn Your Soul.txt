you're the hunter 
got the demon in your knees 
on a mountain 
and you're looking down to paradise 

gonna brush away those wasted years 
and you'll never stop to wonder 
are you making a name, are you feeling no pain? 
then you 

burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the weary hearted 
burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the ones you left behind 

now you're running 
like a roller coaster ride 
revolution 
breaking into flight, you'd better hold on tight 

gonna brush away those wasted years 
and you'll never stop to wonder 
are you making a name, are you feeling no pain? 
then you... 

burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the weary hearted 
burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the ones you left behind 

you are the hunter 
you won't be left behind 
and nothing will change your mind 

gonna brush away those wasted years 
and you'll never stop to wonder 
gonna cry again those bitter tears 
you got something to do, and it's all up to you 
so you'll... 

burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the weary hearted 
burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the ones that parted 

burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the weary hearted 
burn your soul, burn your soul 
nothing for the ones you left behind
