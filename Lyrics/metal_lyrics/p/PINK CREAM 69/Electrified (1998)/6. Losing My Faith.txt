The Day Breaks, my mind aches 
fighting with my destiny 
emotion, confusion, driving me to misery 
i found out, there's something 
that i've never had before 
religion, devotion 
help me fight this hopeless war 

should i stand before the alter? 
should i walk the beaten path? 
if i leave before i falter 
should i make the moment last? 

before i lose my faith 

dismayal, betrayal, running deep inside of me 
i'm kneeling and praying 
for the sign that set's me free 
i listened your wisdom 
taught me things i never knew 
i'm blinded by darkness 
and i don't know what to do! 

should i stand before the alter? 
should i walk the beaten path? 
if i leave before i falter 
should i make the moment last? 

before i lose my faith... Losing my faith... 

should i stand before the alter? 
should i walk the beaten path? 
if i leave before i falter 
should i make the moment last? 

should i stand before the alter? 
should i walk the beaten path? 
if i leave before i falter 
should i make the moment last? 

before i lose my faith... Losing my faith...
