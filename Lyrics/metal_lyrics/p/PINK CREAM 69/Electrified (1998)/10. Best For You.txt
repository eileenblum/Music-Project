so lonely, divided 
i'm not where i wanna be 
my consciense is weighted 
the responsibility 

and so i try, got to find a way 
to make it right, don't you forget about me 
it all takes time 
don't you ever think you're left behind 

all i want is the best for you 
you deserve it, too, my innocent child 
tell me something that i can do 
i'd be happy to, my innocent child 
all i want is the best for you 
you deserve it, too, tell me something new 

the anguish, i suffer 
i want it to let me be 
no harm was intended 
but now it is haunting me 

and so i try, got to find a way 
to make it right, don't you forget about me 
it all takes time 
don't you ever think you're left behind 

all i want is the best for you 
you deserve it, too, my innocent child 
tell me something that i can do 
i'd be happy to, my innocent child 
all i want is the best for you 
you deserve it, too, tell me something new 

it takes my heart out 
got to live before we learn 
it takes my heart out 
i'll let my bridges burn 

and so i try, got to find a way 
to make it right, don't you forget about me 
it all takes time 
don't you ever think you're left behind 

all i want is the best for you 
you deserve it, too, my innocent child 
tell me something that i can do 
i'd be happy to, my innocent child 
all i want is the best for you 
you deserve it, too, tell me something new 
just the best for you 
you deserve it, too 
just the best for you
