i'm electrified, i'm humoungonized 
nothing's gonna get me down 
in a world so vain, i can feel no pain 
i'll take it to the second round 

i'm electing you, be electric, too 
tell me that you're doing fine 
it's a natural high, don't you wonder why 
let me be your power line 

it's alright; it's alright 
if you take the time maybe you will see 
it's alright; it's alright 
was it good for you; well it's good for me 

i'm electrified 

i'm Electrified, I'm adrenalized 
taking changes one by one 
and i don't need hate to control my fate 
i just wanna have my fun 

i'm electrified and my head's so wide 
nothing's gonna get me down 
in a world so vain i can take the pain 
take it to the final round 

it's alright; it's alright 
if you take the time maybe you will see 
it's alright; it's alright 
was it good for you; well it's good for me 

i'm electrified... i'm electrified... 

get your hands out of your pockets 
let the world into your head 
don't you take away the passion 
put it back instead 

it's alright; it's alright 
it's alright; it's alright 
well it's good for me 

i'm electrified 

get your hands out of your pockets 
let the world into your head 
don't you take away the passion 
put it back instead 
i'm electrified
