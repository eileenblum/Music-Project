it's such a damn disgrace 
to see the human race 
fall to pieces right in front of me 
there's got to be a way 
i heard somebody say 
but you must kneel to my philosophy 

looks like a higher kind of life 
what i need 
looks like a higher kind of life 
oh help me, i don't want to be wrong 
someone told me, someone said 
looks like a higher kind of life 
but i won't do it, do it, do it again 

now i'm looking a the sun 
and i'm not the only one 
blinded by new found authority 
he speaks to me the word 
in a way i never heard 
i'm the product of his personality 

looks like a higher kind of life 
what i need 
looks like a higher kind of life 
oh help me, i don't want to be wrong 
someone told me, someone said 
looks like a higher kind of life 
but i won't do it, do it, do it again 

round and round and round we go 
welcome to the one man show... 

looks like a higher kind of life 
what i need 
looks like a higher kind of life 
oh help me, i don't want to be wrong 
someone told me, someone said 
looks like a higher kind of life 
but i won't 
No i won't 
no I won't 
do it again
