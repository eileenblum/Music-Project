look around, alone in the cold 
so mystified 
did you know the stories they told 
would pass you by 

there's a new constitution 
and it's telling you to change your style 
would you like a revolution? 
everybody's got to walk the mile 
you'll be dying 

when you're out on a limb 
and don't know where to begin 
feel like you're living a sin 
cause you're a stranger 
you abide by the rules 
the ones they taught you at school 
they make you feel like a fool 
cause you're a stranger in time 

there's a twist to the story 
now we've reached the point of no return 
one of power one of glory 
are you gonna let your bridges burn 

when you're out on a limb 
and don't know where to begin 
feel like you're living a sin 
cause you're a stranger 
you abide by the rules 
the ones they taught you at school 
they make you feel like a fool 
cause you're a stranger in time 
in time... in time 

are you dying? 
gonna let your bridges burn 
you'll be crying 

when you're out on a limb 
and don't know where to begin 
feel like you're living a sin 
cause you're a stranger 
you abide by the rules 
the ones they taught you at school 
they make you feel like a fool 
cause you're a stranger in time 
in time... in time
