when you hear the voice inside you 
does it tell you what to do? 
do you take the time to listen? 
do the things he asked of you 
break out of the chains that bind you down 
satisfy your soul, go the only way 

out of the darkness of mind 
don't be afraid of your find 

so just 
hold your hand over the fire 
hold your hand over the fire 

now you found a good solution 
now it's time to get it right 
got no time for your excuses 
there will be no alibi 
wait, but there's notime to hesitate 
there's no time to sit and wait 
got to take a chance 
head the words i say 

out of the darkness of mind 
don't be afraid of your find 

hold your hand over the fire 
hold your hand over the fire 
hold your hand over the fire 
hold your hand over the fire 

out of the dark 
into the light it will shine 

you were a clown 
wearing a frown 
life was a circus 
that just came to town 
but it's all just a lie 
and you know why it's a lie 

hold your hand over the fire 
hold your hand over the fire 
hold your hand over the fire 
hold your hand over the fire
