wait before you try to be a hero 
wait before the turning of the tide 
you don't feel the thunder 
and you don't feel the rain 
help's not a word that you defined 
but it's so hard to do 
all the things they ask of you 

break the silence 
let your madness guide the way - the madness 
satisfaction is the price you'll have to pay 
break the silence 

stop the cause i can't listen any longer 
stop the contradiction in your life 
gotta make a difference 
gotta make a change 
help's the word that cuts you like a knife 
but it?s so hard to do 
all the things they ask of you 

break the silence 
let your madness guide the way - the madness 
satisfaction is the price you'll have to pay - the sadness 
search your soul if there's a way to fill the wreck - the blindness 
show your wisdom there?s a chance to get it back 
break the silence 

wait for the sign 
wait for tomorrow 
gotta make a difference 
gotta make a change 
help's the word that cuts you like a knife 
like a knife 

break the silence 
let your madness guide the way - the madness 
satisfaction is the price you'll have to pay - the sadness 
search your soul if there's a way to fill the wreck - the blindness 
show your wisdom there?s a chance to get it back 
break the silence
