Heard your mother she answered the phone 
she whispered softly you're not at home 
i tried to listen, are you really there? 
i get the feeling that you don't care 

now i'm crying, i can't hide my pain no 
got to get away, we got to get away 

now i stand in the poring rain 
see your shadow and call your name 
you want to answer but 
you're caught by surprise 
another reason to say goodbye 

So i'm crying, i can't hide my pain no 
got to get away, we got to get away 

we could take a rocket ride and 
find a place where we could hide 
i'll take you there 
let me take you to a place 
where there's no hurt and no disgrace 
i'll take you there, i'll take you there 

i'll show you love if you take my hand 
i'll lead you off to a promised land 
i'm sick of living in deep dispare 
just take my hand and i'll lead you there 

so i'm crying, i can't hide my pain no 
got to get away, we got to get away 

we could take a rocket ride and 
find a place where we could hide 
i'll take you there 
let me take you to a place 
where there's no hurt and no disgrace 
i'll take you there, i'll take you there 

we're running, we're running 
our lives have gone astray 
we're running, we're hiding away 
we're running, we're hiding away 

we could take a rocket ride and 
find a place where we could hide 
i'll take you there 
let me take you to a place 
where there's no hurt and no disgrace 
i'll take you there 
we could take a rocket ride and 
find a place where we could hide 
i'll take you there 
let me take you to a place 
where there's no hurt and no disgrace 
i'll take you there, i'll take you there
