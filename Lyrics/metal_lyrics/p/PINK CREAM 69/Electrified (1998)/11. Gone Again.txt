I'm waiting for the train darling 
and I don't know where I'm heading to 
But I don't think that it really matters 
It's been a while since we parted 
I close my eyes and I picture your lovely face 
and the sweet scent of your long dark hair 
I was thinking we could get together 
What would she say, what would she say? 

I want you to know that I'm sorry, too 
I want you to know what I'm going through 
Keeping good times and forget our pride 
It's another day without you 
You're gone again, you're gone again 

I tried to call you Up a thousand times 
but all I get is your answering machine 
I'm just a fool like every guy 
I want to change, just help me change 

I want you to know that I'm sorry, too 
I want you to know what I'm going through 
Keeping good times and forget our pride 
It's another day without you 
I want you to know that I'm sorry, too 
I want you to know what I'm going through 
Keeping good times and forget our pride 
It's another day without you 
You're gone again 

Don't ever let, let the sun go down 
cause you're the light in my life 

If I could measure my petitions in prayers 
I'd write them all down again and again 
Cause it's hard to say forgive me 
Don't let me go, don't let me go 

I want you to know that I'm sorry, too 
I want you to know what I'm going through 
Keeping good times and forget our pride 
It's another day without you 
I want you to know that I'm sorry, too 
I want you to know what I'm going through 
Keeping good times and forget our pride 

What should I say when you walk away 
got me believing, that you're gone again
