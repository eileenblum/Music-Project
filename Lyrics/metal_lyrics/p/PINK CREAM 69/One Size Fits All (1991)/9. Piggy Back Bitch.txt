[Dennis Ward / Andi Deris]

One more night in Lovely-City
Though you were right there
It's a shame, it's such a pity
You're takin' - no share
Weekend - lovers got it all worked out
Come on, what's the use ?
I ain't got nothin' to lose

Realize, the sun will shine without you!
Listen up, 'cause I'm got something to say

Piggy Back Bitch, I'm tryin' to please you
Piggy Back Bitch, hangin' on my mind
Piggy Back Bitch, I'm tryin' to please you
Breakin' my back, you'll break your spine

I'm your one, but not your only
Don't think its - unfair
All you've here for is my many
And girl I don't care
Little alley tramp you're charmin' me
It's the truth , I ain't got nothin' to lose

Realize, the sun will shine without you!
Listen up, 'cause I'm got something to say

Piggy Back Bitch, I'm tryin' to please you
Piggy Back Bitch, hangin' on my mind
Piggy Back Bitch, I'm tryin' to please you
Breakin' my back, you'll break your spine
