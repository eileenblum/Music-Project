[Andi Deris]

Don't keep me waitin'
No used to cool down now
My mind's gettin' happy
You drive me nuts somehow

Look in my eyes
There ain't no lies
Every word I say is true

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Every night, every day, all the time
I'm just livin' my life for you
I would die for you and I don't lie
I'm just livin' my life for you

Life is so easy
With just a drink or two
Burn all my money
There's nothing else to do

I'm on the lose
I need the juice
Kill the pain that's in my brain

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Every night, every day, all the time
I'm just livin' my life for you
I would die for you and I don't lie
I'm just livin' my life for you
