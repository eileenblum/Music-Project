[Andi Deris]

Once we were so young and blind
We were all so innocent and kind
So innocent and kind

Whatever the world looks like right now
Whatever the time to come will allow
We taught the children
We taught the children of the earth

All the sorrows of the world
Have been laid like fine in our hands
From the father to the son it stands
So the circle never ends

Whatever the world looks like right now
Whatever the time to come will allow
We taught the children
We taught the children of the earth
Everybody's gotta know wrong and right
Everybody stop!
Turn on the right!
We taught the children
We taught the children of the earth

Once we were so young and blind
We were all so innocent and kind
So innocent and kind

Whatever the world looks like right now
Whatever the time to come will allow
We taught the children
We taught the children of the earth
Everybody's gotta know wrong and right
Everybody stop!
Turn on the right!
We taught the children
We taught the children of the earth
