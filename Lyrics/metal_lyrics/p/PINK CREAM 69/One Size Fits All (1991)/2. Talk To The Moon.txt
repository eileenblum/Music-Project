[Andi Deris]

I would never leave you
Any night, any day
I would never tease you
As you - heartless - do to me
I will always love you
Till the end of my days
I would like to own you
But you're turning away
Could it be you're blind?
Could it be you'll run away, baby?
Could it be my point of view?

If you talk to the moon
You'd better let me know soon
If you talk to the moon
Don't you tell me no lies
When I look in your eyes
If you talk to the moon

Anywhere you go to
I would want to be your guide
Anywhere you come from
I'd be standing at your side
I would like to lead you
If you can't find the way
Couldn't be without you
But you're turning away
Could it be you're blind?
Could it be you'll run away, baby?
Could it be my point of view?

If you talk to the moon
You'd better let me know soon
If you talk to the moon
Don't you tell me no lies
When I look in your eyes
If you talk to the moon

Oh, can't you see me crying?
I'm crying for you

If you talk to the moon
You'd better let me know soon
If you talk to the moon
Don't you tell me no lies
When I look in your eyes
If you talk to the moon
