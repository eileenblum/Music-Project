[Dennis Ward / Andi Deris]

Break down the wall and blow my cover
We're standin' next to one another
Now can't you see the flag is burnin'
We are the force
You better learn it now!
The time is right to start the dealin'
No words can tell the way we're feelin'
Trapped 40 years with 14 million
Don't want to be your mindless minion
The time is right tonight
The time is right tonight

I'm walking out to heaven
I'm walking home to you

So many died so short of freedom
So many failed and laid there bleedin'
No can't you see the border's burning?
We are the force
You better learn it now!
The time is right tonight
The time is right tonight

I'm walking out to heaven
I'm walking home to you
