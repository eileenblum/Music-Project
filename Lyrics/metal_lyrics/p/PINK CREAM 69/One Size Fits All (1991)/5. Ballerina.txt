[Andi Deris]

Once I saw your picture
After I was gone
Forgotten colors
Of the world where you're on
Misery was all around
But you did not see
You're living your life inside a dream

BALLERINA, I hear you cryin'
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got time for tryin'
BALLERINA, dancin' with fire
Ain't got no wishes 
Just got one desire

I saw you dancin' in a road with no end
Dreams of tomorrow
But a child in your head
Agony was all around
But you did not see
You're just a part of memory

BALLERINA, I know you cryin'
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got time for tryin'
BALLERINA, dancin' with fire
Ain't got no wishes 
Just got one desire

BALLERINA, BALLERINA
Dance your dreams
BALLERINA, dance your dreams

BALLERINA, look around
Misery is all around
BALLERINA, look around and see
