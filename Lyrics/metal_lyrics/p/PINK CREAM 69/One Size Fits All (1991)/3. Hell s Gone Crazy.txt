[Andi Deris]

Sheets show us all
Crime's to take control
I don't want you to stay
I will take you away
Hearts turn to stone
Life's a danger zone
I can't take what they've done
Don't look back when we're gone

All hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy

Shades cloud the day
Steal the light away
I don't want you to stay
I will take you away
I will show you the sun
Don't look back when we're gone

All hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy

See all the people
Sitting on pins and needles
They don't know what they've done
Don't look back when we're gone

All hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy
Hell's gone crazy
