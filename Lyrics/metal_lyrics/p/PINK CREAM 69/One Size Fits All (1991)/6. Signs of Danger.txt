[Andi Deris]

You're here beside me
I'm livin' a life that changes
You're inside me
You never care what I go through
Hot desire
Running like fire through you
Higher and higher
As long as you want it to

Changes are colors in my life
Changes can cut you like a knife

Walk the streets under these
Signs of danger
Walk beside me
Away from danger in this world

My name is nowhere
Unless my name is in you
There's no tomorrow
When there is only we two

Changes are colors in my life
Changes can cut you like a knife

Walk the streets under these
Signs of danger
Walk beside me
Away from danger in this world

Walk the streets
Walk the streets under these
Signs of danger in this world
Tell me what we've gonna do, tell me what we've going through
Please !!
Tell me where the hell to go, I wanna know, please

Walk the streets under these signs of danger
Walk beside me, away from danger in this world
