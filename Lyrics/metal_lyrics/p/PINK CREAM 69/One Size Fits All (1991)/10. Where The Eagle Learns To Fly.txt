[Andi Deris]

Somebody's out there in the cold
Freezin' and stravin' I've been told
Breathin' the air we are breathin'
Somebody's out there in the heat
Breathin' the air we are breathin'

Oh Lord, would you please have a heart
Love is just so far away

Take your child to a place where no one cries
To the place where the eagle learns to fly
Only there we will find everlasting peace of mind
In the place where the eagle learns to fly

Somebody's stricken by disease
Hopeless and playin' on his knees
Breathin' the air we are breathin'
Somebody just like you and me
And now he's gone, so who was he
Breathin' the air we were breathin'

Oh Lord, would you please have a heart
Love is just so far away

Take your child to a place where no one cries
To the place where the eagle learns to fly
Only there we will find everlasting peace of mind
In the place where the eagle learns to fly

Oh Lord, would you please have a heart
Love is so far away
So far away

Take your child to a place where no one cries
To the place where the eagle learns to fly
Only there we will find everlasting peace of mind
In the place where the eagle learns to fly
