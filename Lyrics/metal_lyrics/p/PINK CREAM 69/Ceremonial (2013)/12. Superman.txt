[Verse]
Iâve been adrift for most of my life
Giving that love at the edge of the night.
Trying my best to make everything right,
Searching for answers that lead me to lies.

[Pre-Chorus]
Now Iâve been a fool, run from my own dues,
Everythingâs easy when nothingâs to chose.
Iâve been a saint and follow my pride
All of the angels were there at my side.

[Chorus]
You can call me a tramp, call me a liar,
But you know itâs part of the plan.
So get out of my way, I got nothing to say
Cause I ainât no superman.

[Verse]
So many memories of one and some
Some recognized, but itâs taken so long.
Driven by harbor, then guided by fear,
All of the answers are find out too late.

[Pre-Chorus]
But everythingâs cool, everythingâs fine,
I got my stories and I got my wine.
I open into, Iâve lost as the year,
All of my angels will come back to me.

[Chorus]
You can call me a tramp, call me a liar,
But you know itâs part of the plan.
So get out of my way, I got nothing to say
Cause I ainât no superman.

When youâre all saved in peace
Iâll be out on the case
And Iâm proud to be part of the clan.
And I keep my head low cause I want you to know
That I ainât no superman.

I ainât no superman, baby.

Oh, any superman,
Oh, any supermanâ¦

[Chorus]
You can call me a tramp, call me a liar,
But you know itâs part of the plan.
So get out of my way, I got nothing to say
Cause I ainât no superman.

When youâre all saved in peace
Iâll be out on the case
And Iâm proud to be part of the clan.
And I keep my head low cause I want you to know
That I ainât no superman.
