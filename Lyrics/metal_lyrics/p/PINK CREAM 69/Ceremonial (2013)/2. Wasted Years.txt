[Verse]
I made it here, I made it there,
Is all itâs got to take.
Another buss weâre gonna miss
Itâs nothing left to state.
Price is high, result it low,
When you push it all aside
And a few returns, that is happening to me.

[Chorus]
The voice is always calling,
The hunting in your ears
Everyday weâre mad
With all those wasted years.
You donât need to listen
And I am back at this,
I wonder if I would make it
With all those wasted years.

[Verse]
Darken chicks around the hour,
Thereâs always someone when.
When the night takes it back
All you do is sit and stare.
The TV screen is young and spread
Does it takes your thoughts away?
And the late night host is looking older again.

[Chorus]
The voice is always calling,
The hunting in your ears
Everyday weâre mad
With all those wasted years.
You donât need to listen
And I am back at this,
I wonder if I would make it
With all those wasted years.

[Bridge]
Wait for the signs and wait for the call,
Wait for the moment before the fall.
This world is spinning round and twisting your mind
Spinning round, spinning round and twisting your mind.

[Verse]
Rise yourself, itâs so surreal,
Could it all gone so wrong.
Every morning raise your heads
And find now itâs a new day, diamond.

[Chorus]
The voice is always calling,
The hunting in your ears
Everyday weâre mad
With all those wasted years.
You donât need to listen
And I am back at this,
I wonder if I would make it
With all those wasted years.

Are you waiting for a savior?
All those wasted years.
All you waiting for a savior?
All those wasted years.
