[Verse]
Do it once so you will try,
Could not last so we did not try.
People all around the streets
Left him with his disgrace.

When itâs said to teach you cry
Wipe that smile where ever run in this.
How could she know?

[Chorus]
You chose right from wrong,
But itâs too late for a different song,
Took the stranger right inside,
Against his fait.
Couldâve been a different way,
Stop the laughter every way.
You chose right from wrong,
But itâs too late for another song.

[Verse]
This the story in my mind, happens every day and night, oh my.
And sometimes it could be you, many day youâll know just what to do.
Monday morning went to school, wipe the smile right off the teacherâs face,
What a disgrace. So now heâs running away.

[Chorus]
You chose right from wrong,
But itâs too late for a different song,
Took the stranger right inside,
Against his fait.
Couldâve been a different way,
Stop the laughter every way.
You chose right from wrong,
But itâs too late for another song.

[Chorus]
You chose right from wrong,
But itâs too late for a different song,
Took the stranger right inside,
Against his fait.
Couldâve been a different way,
Stop the laughter every way.
You chose right from wrong,
But itâs too late for another song.
