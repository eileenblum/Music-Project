[Verse]
How many times did you wait for things to happen?
How many times would your patience dry?
I draw you a line, but you canât pull yourself
Thereâs just too much commotion, but itâs nothing going on.

[Chorus]
Gotta be hot, gotta be strong,
Gotta be all and more to get along,
The world is just a passage of time.

Though it feels good, though it feels right,
Keeping the faith to guide you through the night.
This world is just a passage of time.

[Verse]
Looking out at the stars to the vast mass of anchors
You wanna believe thereâs so much more to see.
Going out of your way of the unknown nothing
But there are still consequences and there are to realize.

[Chorus]
Gotta be hot, gotta be strong,
Gotta be all and more to get along,
The world is just a passage of time.

Though it feels good, though it feels right,
Keeping the faith to guide you through the night.
This world is just a passage

[Bridge]
I wanna betray you, I wanna dismay you,
Is it all just a lie?
I cannot convince you,
All that you do or donât do
Will lead you to the passage,
Leaving the ignorance behind.

[Verse]
Time for dreaming, time for breathing,
Time for laughing on your pot of gold.
Time for silence, time for anger,
Time for leaving before the storm is torn.

[Chorus]
Gotta be hot, gotta be strong,
Gotta be all and more to get along,
The world is just a passage of time.

Though it feels good, though it feels right,
Keeping the faith to guide you through the night.
This world is just a passage of time.

Keep dreaming, believing
Keep dreamingâ¦

How many times you wait for things to happen?
How many times your patience dries?
