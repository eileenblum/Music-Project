[Verse]
Just like a photograph we all hold in our hands
And it seems like a memory, but all itâs coming back to me again.
Here voices in your head,
You can remember whatâs been seem,
But you can change the wrong to right
And you can take it down tonight.

[Chorus]
You shouldnât have to walk a lonely road
And we shouldnât have to sacrifice,
We shouldnât have to light our make believe,
I believe in start to find your soul.

[Verse]
Before we lost control we had time to set our goal in it
We must wear in summer booze and itâs not just the choice we chosed
When we take chances far from grace
You showdown beaches, you shamed face.
Such a shame had we become,
To those days we have some comments, so

[Chorus]
You shouldnât have to walk a lonely road
And we shouldnât have to sacrifice,
We shouldnât have to light our make believe,
I believe in start to find your soul.

[Bridge]
Itâs just another listener
But it will never break you and never can change you.

Hey, what youâre looking for?
Hey, what youâre looking for?
Show no fear.
Cause I know some things breaking you
Yes, I know some things taking you, making you want it.
And if not too low, never think of you.
I believe, I believe, I believe we have to find your soul.

[Chorus]
You shouldnât have to walk a lonely road
And we shouldnât have to sacrifice,
We shouldnât have to light our make believe,
I believe; find your soul.
