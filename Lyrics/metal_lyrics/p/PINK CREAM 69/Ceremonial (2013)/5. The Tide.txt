[Verse]
Slow down if you just canât take it,
If only a little while,
Thereâs still time to work things out.

Breathe in and relax your temper,
Collect all your thoughts and tell me,
Why you start to scream and shout?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day thereâs always something wrong,
Deep inside you thereâs another raging storm.

[Chorus]
And I feel the way youâre suffering,
But I know that they will never end,
Though itâs hard to keep the demons out your way.

You keep throwing all, like it or not
And youâll love to live with what youâve got
And the scars will heal and so your pride.

[Verse]
Move on, pull yourself together now,
Stop dreaming another lie,
The world is bad, but not torn.

You left for another life, another place,
To hide from your shame and the disgrace,
But Iâve been in those shoes you wore.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day thereâs always something wrong,
Deep inside you thereâs another raging storm.

[Chorus]
And I feel the way youâre suffering,
But I know that we will never end,
Though itâs hard to keep the demons out your way.

You keep throwing all, like it or not
And youâll love to live with what youâve got
And the scars will heal, as well your pride, going with the tide.

[Bridge]
Break out and get away from that rusty cage,
If you wanna be free, then itâs time for you to rest your case.

[Chorus]
And I feel the way youâre suffering,
But I know that they will never end,
Going hard to keep the demons locked up,
Theyâll always follow you around.

You keep throwing all, like it or not
And youâll love to live with what youâve got
And the scars will heal, as well your pride, going with the tide.
