[Verse]
Like the sun turns the night in day
We became what the seasons made,
There will be evolution in time.

You wonât hear what I got to say,
Who do a man soon will guide the way?
With all the secrets and mysteries you portrayed.

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep the walkers in your mind,
A tales of yours are hard to find.
Whatâs the message youâve been told?
Of why we are the places that surround you now.

[Verse]
Distant bones on a mountain stone,
Reason up from the great unknown
Itâs so hard to believe that it was no way.

And all these fables of telling off
I came small, but I get in line,
Fear is being a patron of the whole world.

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep the walkers in your mind,
A tales of yours are hard to find.
Kept the message youâve been told
In a place beyond the logic of the reason.

[Chorus]
Looking back at chanting times
We struggle to become what we are not
Let the storm take its stroll,
Let the thunder, let the thunder roll.

Wanna fly, then spread your wings
Before the wind just pass you by a dread
Thereâs so much beyond control,
So let the thunder, let the thunder roll.

[Bridge]
Itâs a long road to walk alone
So many ways are enchanted,
So just open yourself to
Common sense and contribution.

[Chorus]
Looking back at chanting times
We struggle to become what we are not
Let the storm take its stroll,
Let the thunder, let the thunder roll.

Wanna fly, then spread your wings
Before the wind just pass you by a dread
Thereâs so much beyond control,
So let the thunder, let the thunder roll.
So let the thunder roll,
So let the thunder roll.
