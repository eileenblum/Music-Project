[Verse]
Itâs a world deep inside of me
Many places you will never see.
Always hide the secrets in my life,
Itâs something abandoned deep within my pride.

[Pre-Chorus]
Somewhere out in the darkness stays a life
How many years youâve liked to see

[Chorus]
You know Iâll be there with or without you
And be king for one more day.
Kept the dream alive and if we survive
Is the fullest prize to pay.
King for a day.

[Verse]
There were days I felt you on my skin
You keep on touching, but you found out that Iâm alive
But I feel alone, thereâs a part of me thatâs just been hurt and thrown.

[Pre-Chorus]
Iâll be gone when the morning comes
And thereâs nothing left to see

[Chorus]
You know Iâll be there with or without you
And be king for one more day.
Kept the dream alive and if we survive
Is the fullest prize to pay.

And maybe Iâll still be king for a day.

[Bridge]
Are we got with the morning comes a day.
When itâs nothing left to say.

[Chorus]
You know Iâll be there with or without you
And be king for one more day.
Kept the dream alive and if we survive
Is the fullest prize to pay.
And maybe Iâll still be king for one more day.

Iâll be there with or without you.
Iâll be there with or without you.
Iâll be there, Iâll bet there, Iâll be there.
