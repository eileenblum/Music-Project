[Verse]
Hey, whatâs that sound?
Tell me, Iâm a track, gotta look around.
Hey, whatâs that name?
Prone to a flight like a mob to the flame.

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend a little time in London
And I spend a little time in Rome.
I gotta make my way to Tokio,
But I never get back home.

(CHours)
I canât see holes, Iâm telling scubs,
My friends are having on.
And you gonna hate, appreciate,
Cause they all know that I came to rock,
I wonât ever stop.
Donât care if itâs right or wrong at all,
I came to rock,
I wonât ever stop.
Itâs my life, itâs all I need,
Ainât nobody gonna tell me how
Or when or where or what I gotta do.

[Verse]
Jimmy on this motor rising
With a bit of dream of purple haze.
The jamming of the vault will pump them
When Iâm dead theyâre saying grace.

[Chorus]
I canât see holes, Iâm telling scubs,
My friends are having on.
And you gonna hate, appreciate,
Cause they all know that I came to rock,
I wonât ever stop.
Donât care if itâs right or wrong at all,
I came to rock,
I wonât ever stop.
Itâs my life, itâs all I need,
Ainât nobody gonna tell me how
Or when or where or what I gotta do.

[Bridge]
This is the blood thatâs running through my veins,
Keeps me alive and it keeps me sane.
Itâs my life, itâs a dream Iâm chasing.
Iâll never get another chance like this
Sometimes I hit it and sometimes I miss,
Now I hear a million voices at night.

[Chorus]
I came to rock,
I wonât ever stop.
Donât care if itâs right or wrong at all,
I came to rock,
I wonât ever stop.
Itâs my life, itâs all I need,
Everybodyâs pushing, cause they know they canât do rock.
Itâs our life, itâs all we need,
Ainât nobody ever gonna tell us stop
No ainât nobody ever gonna tell me what to do.
