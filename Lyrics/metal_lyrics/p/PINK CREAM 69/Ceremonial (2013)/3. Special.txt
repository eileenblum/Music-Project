[Verse]
So where I am inside my space
Itâs not a soul around, no embrace.
I look along behind the screen,
Nobodyâs waiting for me.

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be my fantasy
If I can show my energy.
So thereâs a new world here for me.

[Chorus]
And I feel so special, God, I feel so special
Who is there and who is proud,
Leave the writing on the wall
Because theyâre special,
God, I feel so special,
Do I like it? I donât know,
I donât love this salty joke.

[Verse]
I chose to die when I seem to lie,
Turning it on again, feel so right.
No, I donât need no privacy,
Who could despy on me.

[Pre-Chorus]
Itâs just so much that one can show
With just a picture from long ago
Donât wanna be just some django.

[Chorus]
And I feel so special, God, I feel so special
Looking where I am today,
Got my demon on despay.
And Iâm so special,
God, I feel so special,
Take a look at my new fault
And the bads went all and one, because Iâm special.
And imma stay so until Iâm sentenced to die.

[Chorus]
And I feel so special, God, I feel so special,
There is so much on my mind,
With a meaning undefined.
And I feel so special, God, I feel so special,
Hereâs a picture of my friend,
He is sick, got me again, pick up so special.
