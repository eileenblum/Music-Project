[Verse]
Nowâs got the time, your dream machine,
Driving with the passion through the night.
In the stroll you feel the beat,
Youâre driving faster than the speed of light.

[Pre-Chorus]
Got your hands upon the wheel
Now itâs time to test your nerves of steel.

[Chorus]
Itâs not a nightmare, itâs time for you to care,
Iâll take your place in the big machine.
Itâs not your last scream, itâs not all that it seems,
Catch your place in the big machine.
Your time was call.

[Verse]
Now you feel the air drive against the road
As I will push the pedal to the floor.
To the observatory along the way
Itâs only long to live another day.

[Pre-Chorus]
Iâm feeling that youâve come alive,
Donât forget youâre on a bad with lie.

[Chorus]
Itâs not a nightmare, itâs time for you to care,
Iâll take your place in the big machine.
Itâs not your last scream, itâs not all that it seems,
I take your place in the big machine.
Your time was call.

[Bridge]
Feel the passion in you come alive,
It could get you on a paradise.

[Chorus]
Itâs not a nightmare, itâs time for you to care,
Iâll take your place in the big machine.
Itâs not your last scream, itâs not all that it seems,
Catch your place in the big machine.
Riding down the road with a heavy load
Catch your place in the big machine.
Hands up on the wheel, test your driverâs skill,
Get your place in the big, the big machine.
