[Verse]
Reach for the fire, people conspire,
The chemical burnt the rush.
The whole world is waiting, anticipating
Safely behind closed doors.

[Pre-Chorus]
And now weâre looking at the faces of evil,
Define my ignorance in cover lands
Along the roads just canât stand the destruction,
Blood on their hands.

[Chorus]
Itâs a loss, itâs a shame, itâs not right,
Itâs a land of confusion.
Lost, damned,
Any debators to the end.

[Verse]
Follow the reasons, follow back treason,
Into the luck and cave.
Force and resistance wide in the distance
Between black and white man that it is.

[Pre-Chorus]
Across the boarder there is chaos and anger,
Weâll finally come by and across the sea.
Are we all saviors in this ongoing story?
Whoâs prone to be?

[Chorus]
Itâs a loss, itâs a shame, itâs not right,
Itâs a land of confusion.
Lost, damned,
Any debators to the end.

[Bridge]
You know you never even been there,
You wanna know what you been try
Begin decisions based on nothing,
Nobodyâs thinking on their own.

[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the old room peoples fight for their freedom,
A weak will, there is no sacrifice.
A disapproval will be known as your bury,
Whoâs mess can be?

[Chorus]
Itâs a loss, itâs a shame, itâs not right,
Itâs a land of confusion.
Lost, damned,
Any debators to the end.
