live through the changes
day into night
one chance to prove that
life is a good waste of time

on the highway
to a new place
count the passing lights
day is breakin'
now I'm takin'
new road into life
don't need to try
I'm doin' fine

I'll live through the changes
day into night
life for the moment
when it feels right
one chance to prove that
life is a good waste of time

empty pockets
young and able
see it in my smile
night has broken
doors are open
runnin' like a child
once in a lifetime
I'm doin' fine

live through the changes
day into night
life for the moment
it's gotta be right
one chance to prove that
life is a good waste of time

somebody said to be cool
watch out and don't be a fool
the times can kick you around
so keep your feet on the ground
but I know life is just
a good waste of time

I'll live through the changes
day into night
life for the moment
it's gotta be right
one chance to prove that
life is a good waste of time
a good waste of time
I'm gonna waste my time
