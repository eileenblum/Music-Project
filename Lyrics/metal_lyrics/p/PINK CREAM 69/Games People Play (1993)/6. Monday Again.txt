I spent my weekend blasted
out of my head
5:30 Monday morning
get out of my bed
old lady's out in the kitchen
bitchin' till I go insane
yes it's Monday, Monday again
yes it's Monday again

I stand in line, it's raining
my bus is late
elbow my way through crowds of people I hate
nobody pays attention
nobody knows my name
yes it's Monday, Monday again
yes it's Monday again

sit hypnotised by a computer
chained, I'm a slave to time
five days to go before there's freedom
I got the weekend on my mind
listen I'm sick of rejection
damn, how I wish I could say
no more Mondays, Mondays again
no more Mondays again
