intoxication, running through this veins
he feels cold, is he insane?
deep in his brain the knows it all
but can't explain

running on empty, almost out of bread
giving all that he's got, taking all he can get
feels the end is near as the foreign dreamlands disappear

now he's back again, blind with open eyes
still alive, still alive
leaving once again, can he still deny
he's still alive, still alive

wish you could see him as he slowly dies
to the shame and pain
we close our eyes and pass by
but the end is near
and we know it's his world that we fear

now he's back again, blind with open eyes
still alive, still alive
leaving once again, can he still deny
he's still alive, still alive

see how we got through the stages
soon we'll be turning the pages
still alive, still alive
need is a hurting desire
life is a walk through the fire
still alive, still alive

intoxication, running through his veins
