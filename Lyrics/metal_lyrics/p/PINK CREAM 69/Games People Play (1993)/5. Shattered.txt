freeze a second, hold the moment
stop the hand of time
just a word, a thought is spoken
says my love was blind

now I stand all alone and wonder
why there's tears in my eyes
it's a spell that I been under
once again - don't know why

listen up, you better not talk
save your lies, I can't hear 'em no more

you shattered my heart
you shattered my soul
shattered my pride
met your goal
you shattered my heart
you shattered my soul
scattered pieces
you shattered my soul

Someday you were the one to count on,
You were friend and romance
All I hope is you burn your fingers
When you need someone's hand

listen up, you better not talk
save your lies, I can't hear 'em no more

you shattered my heart
you shattered my soul
shattered my pride
met your goal
you shattered my heart
you shattered my soul
scattered pieces
you shattered my soul

listen up, you better not talk
just shut up, go take a walk
listen up, you better not talk
save your lies, I can't hear 'em no more

you shattered my heart
you shattered my soul
shattered my pride
met your goal
you shattered my heart
you shattered my soul
scattered pieces
you shattered my soul
