termination
frustration
can't change the world we see
turn daylight
to darkness
the 20th century
dyin' century

see the devil with a look in his eye
laughin' at us and we all know why
got his eye on a big victory
dyin' century

walkin' in a world desolation
livin' in the waste of every nation
don't cry when it's all history
dyin' century

expiration
starvation
on your prime time tv
pure madness
brings sadness
the 20th century
dyin' century

see the devil with a look in his eye
laughin' at us and we all know why
got his eye on a big victory
dyin' century

walkin' in a world desolation
livin' in the waste of every nation
don't cry when it's all history
dyin' century

termination
expiration

see the devil with a look in his eye
laughin' at us and we all know why
got his eye on a big victory
dyin' century

walkin' in a world desolation
livin' in the waste of every nation
don't cry when it's all history
dyin' century

now the devil is you and I 
we're so blind now we can't even cry
have you heard the voice of history?
dyin' century
