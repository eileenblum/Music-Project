so slow anywhere the wind can blow
how it does I'll never know
and it never crossed my mind
red wine - can't you see I'm feelin' fine
smokin' with a friend of mine
leavin' our troubles far behind

lookin' out my window I find
there's a place beyond space and time
and then I sail
somedays I sail

downtown, gonna see who's hangin' out
good to see them all unwound
guess you know the way I feel
somedays I just gotta sail away
tell me why I should stay
life is really no big deal

lookin' out my window I find
there's a place beyond space and time
and then I sail
somedays I sail

in a world that's soon out of time
I release my soul and my mind
and I know my way I will find
and then I sail
somedays I sail
sailin' out on a memory
somedays I sail
