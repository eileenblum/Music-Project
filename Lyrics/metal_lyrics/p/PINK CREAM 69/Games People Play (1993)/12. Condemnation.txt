wise men say
listen to your heart
don't throw your dreams away
mad men play
with power and they say
blow those fools away

we don't need power play people
they piss me off

we don't need condemnation
we're not breakin' the law
we don't need condemnation
leave us alone

fools have shown
what everyone had known
and all have known the truth
lovers fight
they lie to make it right
the truth can sometimes hurt

we don't need power play people
they piss me off

we don't need condemnation
we're not breakin' the law
we don't need condemnation
leave us alone

you don't have time
so open up your mind
no two think the same
let them be
maybe then they'll see
there's no one to blame

we don't need power play people
they piss me off

we don't need condemnation
we're not breakin' the law
we don't need condemnation
leave us alone
