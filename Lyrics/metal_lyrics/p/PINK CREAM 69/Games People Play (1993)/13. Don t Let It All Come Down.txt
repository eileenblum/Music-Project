if the night falls like a hammer
hits a nail into your soul
if the rain beats on your window
and you lose control
hold your tears back for a moment
light a candle to the night
al you gotta do is call me
and I'll arrive

don't ever let it all come down on you
why don't you open up your eyes and see
don't ever let it all come down on you
'cause you got me
why don't you open up your eyes and see

take a ride into the future
come with me to wonderland
can you see us when we're older
walkin' hand in hand
so the sun don't shine forever
but you're not alone tonight
and I'll be here with you tomorrow
in the morning light

don't ever let it all come down on you
why don't you open up your eyes and see
don't ever let it all come down on you
'cause you got me
why don't you open up your eyes and see

don't ever let it all come down on you
why don't you open up your eyes and see
don't ever let it all come down on you
'cause you got me
why don't you open up your eyes and see
