there's a girl from the far side of town
I tell you man, she's all I've been missing
got some bucks and her feet on the ground
she's so fine, I can't get her off my mind

I've got the time, she's got a place
I want to see her in black lace
I'm not her kind, but I don't mind
I gotta get her

girl, I can't stop till you're mine
till you're mine, till you're mine
girl, I can't stop till you're mine

home alone and I pick up the phone
I take a chance and dial her number
all she said was the name of her street
with a smile - you know where I'm gonna go

we've got time, we've got a place
I'm gonna see her in that lace
am I her kind? well, never mind
I'm gonna have her!

girl, I can't stop till you're mine
till you're mine, till you're mine
girl, I can't stop till you're mine
I'll keep tryin' till you're mine

I gotta get her
I gotta make her mine
shouldn't be long now
baby, I won't stop all you're mine

girl, I can't stop till you're mine...
