in a time when the world seems unstable
feels like the worst has the best of you and nothing goes right
cause you're not alone
have you ever seen hunger?
or have you ever seen anyone with nothing at all
take a look at the one or the other
there's only one thing I can say
you're not down on your luck
down on your luck
take some time to look around
got no reason to be down
so down on your luck
down on your luck
might be rainin' in your bed
but you've got a place to lay your head down

you're a man not a shell made of crystal
you could be broken in pieces but you mend back again
and you'll always have somebody waitin' for you to come home
got a life, got your mind and your body
there's so much more that you can say
so you're not down on your luck
down on your luck
take some time to look around
got no reason to be down
so down on your luck
down on your luck
might be rainin' in your bed
but you've got a place to lay your head down

you're not under pressure
your life is so long
always got something to say
fear no destruction
you just can't go wrong
lucky to be here today

so you're not down on your luck
down on your luck
