you can take my soul 
and you can rape my mind 
play the starring role 
so thick with fright 
you can smash it all 
for your own delight 
and you can sell it all 
for a ticket out of here 

you need change 
in your life 

let the game begin 
for this blatent sin 
money talks for sure 
in a world so poor 

you need change 
in your life, in your life 
you need change 

but, they want to get you everything that you need 
and they wanna... 

you can change your rhyme 
so it flows with mine 
broken thought's your crime 
dream away, dream away 
you could steal a gun 
maybe shot someone 
broken thought's your crime 
yes, i hate to see you smile 

you need change 
in your life, in your life 
you need change 
but, they want to get you everything that you need 
and they want to slice all your pride 
but you are ready for this crime 

you need change 
you need change in your life 
you need change 
you need change in your life 

you could steal a gun 
maybe shot someone 
broken thought's your crime 
yes, i hate to see you smile 
they want to get you everything that you need 
and they want to slice all your pride 
but you are ready for this crime 

change 
in your life, in your life 
you need change 

but, they want to get you everything that you need 
and they want to CHANGE you!!
