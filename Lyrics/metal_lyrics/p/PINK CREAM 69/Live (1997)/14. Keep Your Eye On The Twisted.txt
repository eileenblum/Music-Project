turn on the tube, what do I see? 
a bunch of hateful people talking to me 
the crap they say's been heard before 
and that's what started up the 2nd World War! 

so many people see what's going on 
heads should be lifted 

keep your eyes on the twisted 
we've seen it all before 
little minds can't be shifted 
watch out they're back for more 

they call it pride to wave the flag 
shaving the hair off of their brainless heads 
I think the world has seen enough 
there's too much talking now it's time to get tough 

too many people see what's going on 
heads should be lifted 

keep your eyes on the twisted 
we've seen it all before 
little minds can't be shifted 
watch out they're back for more 

hey twisted - what's in your head - so twisted 
hey twisted - go clear your mind - you're misled 

steps should be taken to stop what they're makin 
heads should be lifted... to see what's going on 

they spread their mental disease 
ignorance needs a leader to make their mass increase 

so keep your eyes on the twisted..
