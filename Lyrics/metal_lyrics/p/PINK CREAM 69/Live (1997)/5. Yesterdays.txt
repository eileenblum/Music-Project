One man sits with his head hung low 
Nowhere to run, got no place to go 
There was a time when his town held homes 
Now it's trash and broken homes 

Every day, haulin' off the dead 
So many scenes flashin' through his head 
A little kid had to ask me "why" 
Should I laugh? Maybe I'll just cry 

So many folks tune in the living hell 
They wanna know where the bombs just fell 
Your TV screens show them crashing down 
Can you see the lights? Can you hear the sound? 

Guess the times have got the best of me 
What the hell is this supposed to prove 
they don't want to feel this misery 
Hear 'em screaming and they dare not move 
Guess the times have got the best of me 
Has there got to be a single bullet 
Put it right up to my head 
Half a chance you know that I would use it 

Guess the times have got the best of me 
What the hell is this supposed to prove 
they don't want to feel this misery 
Hear 'em screaming and they dare not move 
Guess the times have got the best of me 
Has there got to be a single bullet 
They don't want to fell this misery 

Remember yesterday, oh yesterday 

One man sits with his cigarettes 
Drinks his gin like his own regrets
