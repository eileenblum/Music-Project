How many times have I died because of sorrows ? 
So many times I've been scared about tomorrow 
Never brew why, now I'm asking for a reason 
How many tears, tell me, how many tears will fall ? 
How many fools have been paying for the evil ? 
How many "Gods" have been lying to the people ? 
Where are you now that I'm asking for the reason ? 
How many tears will fall ? 

When the sheets are empty - Do you like it like that ? 
When your heart is empty - Do you like it like that ? 
When your pockets are empty - Do you like it like that ? 
When your life is gettin' cold 
Do you like it like that ? 
How many lies can you tell to hide an error ? 
How many smiles can you practice in your mirror ? 
Where are you now that I'm asking for the reason ? 
How many tears, tell me, how many tears will fall ? 
How many men have been trusted out of season ? 
How many promises broken without reason ? 
Where are you now and what about tomorrow ? 
How many tears will fall ? 

When the sheets are empty - Do you like it like that ? 
When your heart is empty - Do you like it like that ? 
When your pockets are empty - Do you like it like that ? 
When your life is gettin' cold 
Do you like it like that ?
