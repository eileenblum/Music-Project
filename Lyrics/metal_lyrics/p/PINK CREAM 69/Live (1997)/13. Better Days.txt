I looked through a window 
just to let my mind flow 
then i saw a friend who 
was looking for a friend too 

spoke of her father 
said he'll be leaving us 
she'll be so lonely 
and i want to understand 

then i'll try to convince her 
there'll be better days 

got to be patient 
i always told her 
somedays are diamond 
ooh, the words that i sold her 

she wants to be happy 
she can't find a remedy 
her obligations 
will never let her fly away 

then i'll try to convince her 
there'll be better days 
Better Days 

So i'll try to convince her 
there'll be better days 
there'll be better days 
gonna find you a better day 

then i'll try to convince her 
then i'll try to convince her 

there'll be better days 
there'll be better days 
gonna find you a better day 

Better days... 

she wants to be happy 
She can't find a remedy 
spoke of her father 
she wants to be happy 
so maybe she can fly away 
to a better day, a better day...
