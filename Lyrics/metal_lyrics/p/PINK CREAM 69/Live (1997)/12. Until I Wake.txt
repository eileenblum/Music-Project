i know another wrong won't make it right 
i know another drink won't keep my senses clean 
put a gun up to my head, might stop me for a while 
i know another shot could get me through the night 

but i feel my anger, and i'm so unstable 
and i want to hold back, but i'm just not able 
so i found redemption in a long white bottle 
could it be i'm desperate? when it keeps me calm... 

until I wake 

i need another way to get me loose 
i need another way to let my thoughts go free 
cantcha understand that i'm a complicated man ? 
i need another shot before i tie my noose 

but i feel my anger, and i'm so unstable 
and i want to hold back, but i'm just not able 
so i found redemption in a long white bottle 
could it be i'm desperate? when it keeps me calm... 

Until I wake, until i wake 

hey yeah.... it's my mind, yeah... it's my way, yeah 
and it comforts me, yes it comforts me 
But i never - felt at ease 
and i'm on my - bended knees 
and nothing can - stop me now 
cause i'm loaded... 

could i learn my lesson? cantcha feel my anger 

break me, can't make me, 
believe me, yeah !!! 

But I feel my anger, but i feel my anger 
but i feel my anger, i feel so alone... 

but i feel my anger, and i'm so unstable 
and i want to hold back, but i'm just not able 
so i found redemption in a long white bottle 
could it be i'm desperate? when it keeps me calm... 

Until I wake, until i wake...
