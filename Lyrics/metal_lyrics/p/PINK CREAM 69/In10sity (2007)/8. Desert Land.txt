Here I am alone again in my darkened room
Memories of long lost days of which I am a slave
I'm trapped inside my solitude and my broken dreams
But my memory's all clouded now eternally

Am I but a novelty in this desert land?
Far off tides have washed away the message in the sand
If I cast aside the barricade will I then survive?
Cause my spirit feels so empty now, but I'm alive...
