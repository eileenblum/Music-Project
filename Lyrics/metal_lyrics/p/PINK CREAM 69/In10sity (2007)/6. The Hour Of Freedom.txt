I know the truth of who's to blame
No one will deny
I cannot not run from the sun
What a hopeless crime!

I won't be blamed for all the pain
And all the anger in this world
But now I've taken my last chance
I got heartache in return

Gotta fly, set me free
I'm beggin' on my bended knees
And I pray that I find my way home
In a world made of fear
Where justice makes you shed a tear
In my dreams I can turn back the time
To my life before the storm...

I count the days as they go by
In my rusty cage
I'm so alone on my throne
Who will rescue me?

My only thoughts are my regrets
Now that I must pay my debt
A guilty soul lost in time
At the verdict I just wept

Gotta fly, set me free
I'm beggin' on my bended knees
And I pray that I find my way home
In a world made of fear
Where justice makes you shed a tear
In my dreams I can turn back the time
To my life before the storm...

I was caught between the right and wrong
A voice inside it kept me strong
As the henchman walk away
The plot now thickens...

And I can't believe I was such a fool
How can a person be so cruel?
After all is said and done
My hour of freedom has come...

Gotta fly, set me free
I'm beggin' on my bended knees
And I pray that I find my way home
In a world made of fear
Where justice makes you shed a tear
In my dreams I can turn back the time

Gotta fly, set me free
I'm beggin' on my bended knees
And I pray that I find my way home
In a world made of fear
Where justice makes you shed a tear
In my dreams I can turn back the time
To my life before the storm...

I won't be blamed for all the pain
And all the anger in this world
But now I've taken my last chance
I got heartache in return...
