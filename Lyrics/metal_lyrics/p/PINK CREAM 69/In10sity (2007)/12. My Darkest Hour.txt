Welcome to reality
The noise without the sound
A wicked silhouette I see
That follows on the ground

Peel off my shedding skin
Unleash the demons in my head
Look at the state I'm in
How can I get away?

In my darkest hour
I hide behind the shadows of the night
I pray that the fear won't last forevermore
In my darkest hour
My heartbeat echoes through these heavy walls
A sparkle is all I ask to guide me through this darkest hour

Analyzing constantly
Searching for a cure
This ailing has control of me
It's more than I can endure

Just like a loaded gun
I'm cocked and ready to explode
This shot can't be undone
I've got to get away!

In my darkest hour
I hide behind the shadows of the night
I pray that the fear won't last forevermore
In my darkest hour
My heartbeat echoes through these heavy walls
A sparkle is all I ask to guide me through this darkest hour

The lights are slowly fading
And there's nowhere left to go
I crawl into my sanctuary down below...

Welcome to reality
Analyzing constantly

Peel off my shedding skin
Unleash the demons in my head
Look at the state I'm in
How can I get away, get away?

In my darkest hour
I hide behind the shadows of the night
I pray that the fear won't last forevermore
In my darkest hour
My heartbeat echoes through these heavy walls
A sparkle is all I ask to guide me through this darkest hour

Through this darkest hour
Through this darkest hour...
