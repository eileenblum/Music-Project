I can't sleep but I've gotta pass the time
I can't think when I loose my mind
And it kills me inside to make me wonder

I can't fall when I'm crawling on the ground
I can't hear when I make a sound
And it's high time to leave this rock I'm under

I make waves but you always take control
I wanna scream but it burns my throat
Until every single hour, I loose a little power

No way out for me
I've got to find my dignity
Cause nothing else can take away this sorrow
No way out for me
I'm not the man I used to be
But I can make it on my own

I make tracks but they only lead to pain
I step back and you make your gain
But when push comes to shove, we're going nowhere

I aim high but you always shoot me down
I try to fight but my hands are bound
And the words that I have kept inside are deepening this great divide

No way out for me
I've got to find my dignity
Cause nothing else can take away this sorrow
No way out for me
I'm not the man I used to be
But I can make it on my own
