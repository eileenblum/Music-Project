Looking out into the vacant sky
Like the future, it's just high and dry
I thought this world would take me by the hand
And teach me things I couldn't understand

I cannot say that I am sorry
I cannot say that I've been left behind...

On the last train to nowhere
Travelled so long, I waste my life away
On the last train to nowhere, and no no one knows
If I come or go

I've been a sinner, I have been a saint
I tell my stories with the pictures I paint
But after all's been done, there's still to be said
One million lines of grief still locked up in my head

I cannot say that I am sorry
I cannot say that I've been left behind...

On the last train to nowhere
Travelled so long, I waste my life away
On the last train to nowhere, and no no one knows
If I come or go

Should I have listened to my heart?
Should I have torn this world apart?
Should I have quit while I was strong?

But there's no turning back again
I keep on riding until then
Down the track that I've been running on

And all the stops I've passed
Are like the days gone by
Another chance I've missed and never will return...

On the last train to nowhere
Travelled so long, I waste my life away
On the last train to nowhere, and no no one knows
If I come or go

If I come or go
If I come or go...
