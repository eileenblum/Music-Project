I'm on the run, I'm on the loose
I'm just a man, no master plan
I do the best I can

Won't you take time, have a word with me
Can I be who I want to be?
Running down the road of a one track mind
Wanna believe that I'm out of line

Can't loose what I never had
Mixing me up with the Good and bad
What can I say to get your thought undone?
Can't you understand?

I'm on the run, I'm on the loose
I did my time, yeah...
I'm just a man, no master plan
I do the best I can

Caught in the crossfire
Labeled me a foe and there's nowhere I can go
Caught in the crossfire
Cuts me like a knife when I'm walking through my life

Shotgun hanging on the wall
Big boys gotta stand so tall
Rubbing on the barrel with his head held high
Taken away with patriotic pride

No place, not enough for both
Would he be shocked that I took the oath?
What you gotta prove if your number one?
Always got me on the run!

I'm on the run, I'm on the loose
I did my time, yeah...
I'm just a man, no master plan
I do the best I can

Caught in the crossfire
Labeled me a foe and there's nowhere I can go
Caught in the crossfire
Living like a mole, won't be stuck inside my hole anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore...

I'm on the run, I'm on the loose...

Caught in the crossfire
Labeled me a foe and there's nowhere I can go
Caught in the crossfire
Living like a mole, won't be stuck inside my hole anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore...
I can't take anymore, anymore, anymore...
