Yeah...

A disturbing vision in my mind
The only thing you will find
All my thoughts just fade away
And it's killing me inside

The chaos that I've come to know
It echoes from my head to toe
Wicked thoughts encumber me
Now I'm left to decide

I will never forget how it struck me deep inside
To find out life is only a test and time goes by

I've been haunted by my yesterdays
The reasons for the pain won't go away
But I'm not afraid anymore
We were running to the light
Running from our demons of the night
But I'm not afraid anymore

No, no, no, no...

I'm the man that I've become to be
I will learn from my mistakes
To continue on this winding road
Just as long as it may take

I don't know but I've been told
My situations growing old
Release me from the hands of time
That have kept me behind

When it's all said and done, retribution will have its way
There's a place in my soul where the darkness just drives me insane

I've been haunted by my yesterdays
The reasons for the pain won't go away
But I'm not afraid anymore
We were running to the light
Running from our demons of the night
But I'm not afraid, no I'm not afraid anymore

No, no, no, no...

I've been haunted by my yesterdays
The reasons for the pain won't go away
But I'm not afraid
We were running to the light
Running from our demons of the night
But I'm not afraid anymore

I've been haunted by my yesterdays
The reasons for the pain won't go away
But I'm not afraid anymore
We were running to the light
Running from our demons of the night
But I'm not afraid anymore

No, no, no, no...

I'm not afraid anymore...
