Out in the jungle there's a
Growing hunger and I
Think it's time to hear the music that we love
Getting sick of all this nonsense
People come and go at dispense
There's too much bullshit being shoved into my head

I wanna hear you rock
I wanna sooth my soul
I wanna hear the DJ play the music that I love
I wanna hear you rock
You got to take control
Because there's too much monkey business to think of

What a dirty business?!

There's something in the city
They're getting down and gritty
It's a revolution, and it's comin' down your way (comin' down your way)
You've got to drive us wild and
Cut loose our inner child and
Do you get my message? Cause there's nothing left to say

I wanna hear you rock
I wanna sooth my soul
I wanna hear the DJ play the music that I love
I wanna hear you rock
You got to take control
Because there's too much monkey business to think of

I wanna hear you rock
I wanna sooth my soul
I wanna hear the DJ play the music that I love
I wanna hear you rock
You got to take control
Because there's too much monkey business to think of

I wanna hear you rock
I wanna sooth my soul
I wanna hear the DJ play the music that I love
I wanna hear you rock
You got to take control
Because there's too much monkey business to think of

What a dirty business?!
