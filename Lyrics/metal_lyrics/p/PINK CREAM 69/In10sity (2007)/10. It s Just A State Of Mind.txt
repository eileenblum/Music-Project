As you face tomorrow
Just the same old sorrow
Got to find a cure
Will it be forever
I guess it's now or never?
No one knows for sure

Are you lying to yourself now?
Did you show your dismay?
As you wake from your illusion
It takes you higher, just takes you higher...

In this state of mind (state of mind)
It's an endless test of time
Got to find a way (find a way)
That will guide you through the day

It's just a state of mind...

It's a downward spiral
For your own survival
Driving you insane
You've been asking questions
Can someone tell you
There's just got to be an ending to this game

Are you lying to yourself now?
Did you show your dismay?
As you wake from your illusion
It takes you higher, just takes you higher

In this state of mind (state of mind)
It's an endless test of time
Got to find a way (find a way)
That will guide you through the day

It's just a state of mind...

What a state of mind!
Must be driving you insane
No one knows the answer anyway...

In this state of mind (state of mind)
It's an endless test of time
Got to find a way (find a way)
That will guide you through the day

In this state of mind (in this state of mind)
It's an endless test of time (test of time)
Got to find a way (got to find a way)
That will guide you through the day

It's just a state of mind...

It takes you higher
Will it be forever?
