Another year goes by
Times are changing, pain subsides
They talk of days of old
We'll never be the same

But we are living in circles
Repeating what we know
Only war and destruction
Seems to steal the show

Stop this madness!
Stop this sadness!
Stop this madness!

Somewhere at the edge
Somewhere there's a dream alive
Defy the life we have
And never will the children cry
Now we must be strong
To reach the point that we belong
Drowning in wasted tears
Will never compensate for wasted years

So many songs have been sung
We long for freedom often won
And marched with heads held high
Then asked the question "Why?"

Is there really a reason?
Are there ways to break this mold?
We're getting louder and louder
But the volume is controlled

Stop this madness!
Stop this sadness!
Stop this madness!

Somewhere at the edge
Somewhere there's a dream alive
Defy the life we have
And never will the children cry
Now we must be strong
To reach the point that we belong
Drowning in wasted tears
Will never compensate for wasted years

Stop this madness!
Stop this sadness!

Somewhere at the edge
Somewhere there's a dream alive
Defy the life we have
And never will the children cry
Now we must be strong
To reach the point that we belong
Drowning in wasted tears
Will never compensate for wasted years

Somewhere at the edge
Somewhere there's a dream alive
Defy the life we have
And never will the children cry
Now we must be strong
To reach the point that we belong
Drowning in wasted tears
Will never compensate for wasted years

Stop this madness!
