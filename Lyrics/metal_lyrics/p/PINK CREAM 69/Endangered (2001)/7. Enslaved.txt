Plastic people in this new dimension 
Can you read between the lines? 
Sick and tired of getting your attention 
Can you hear me in your minds? 
What is your intention? 

Just a slave, to the grave 
Got to think for you yourself 
There'll be nobody else 
Just a slave, to the grave 
With your life in your hands 
You're enslaved by the last command 

Time to listen to the voice of freedom 
If you don't the game goes on 
Don't be scared they only call it treason 
When they come you will be gone 
Give me one more reason 

Just a slave, to the grave 
Got to think for you yourself 
There'll be nobody else 
Just a slave, to the grave 
With your life in your hands 
You're enslaved by the last command 

I hear the voice of freedom 
Understand 
What has been done 

I hear the voice of freedom 
Understand 
You will be gone 
You're in command 

You're just a slave, to the grave 
Got to think for you yourself 
There'll be nobody else 
Just a slave, to the grave 
With your life in there hands 
And your in there command 
You're just a slave, to grave 
Got to think for you yourself 
There'll be nobody else 
Just a slave, to the grave 
With your life in your hands 
You're enslaved by the last command
