So tired of searching 
Deep inside your heart 
Asking the question 
Were to make a start 
You look in the mirror 
Don't like what you see 
The face of a stranger 
Will never set you free 

You're living your life in vein 
But can you forget your shame 

Walk, walk with me, to the light 
Trust the wise man in the night 
Take my hand, Hold on tight 
Trust the Wise man in the light 

Feel the emotion 
Moving through your veins 
Deeper devotion 
Slowly heals the pain 
Use all your wisdom 
And fight away your fears 
Forget all the darkness 
And all those wasted tears 

You gave all your life in vain 
But it can't be the same 

Walk, walk with me, to the light 
Trust the wise man in the night 
Take my hand, Hold on tight 
Trust the Wise man in the light 

Walk, walk with me, to the light 
Trust the wise man in the light 

Cast away the madness 
You could never understand 
And listen to the Wise man in your heart 

Walk, walk with me, to the light 
Trust the wise man in the night 
Take my hand, Hold on tight 
Trust the Wise man in the light 
Let the wise man feed your might 

Cast away the madness 
You could never understand 
And listen to the Wise man in your heart
