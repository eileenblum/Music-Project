Sleep now, 
Close my eyes and slip away 
Forces, 
Hold the line so I wont stray 
Teach me, 
I may learn from what I find 
Strangers, 
Float inside my mind 

Under the strain 
My soul remains 
Break from the chains 
So watch me in my dreams now 

Voices, 
Spoken from a distant land 
Faces, 
Laid forever in the sand 
Feelings, 
I was sure I'd never known 
Help me, 
Discover what they'd shown 

Under the strain 
My soul remains 
Break from the chains 
I slip away 
I've gone astray 
To my dismay 
And watch me in my dreams 

I fall asleep and then I see 
So many people that arn't me 
I move inside there lonely spirit 

Watch me in my dreams 
Watch me in my dreams 
Sleep now 
Sleep now
He don't need your touch
