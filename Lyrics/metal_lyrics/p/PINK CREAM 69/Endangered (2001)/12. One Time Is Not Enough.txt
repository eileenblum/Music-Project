Waking in the morning 
And I stare at the wall 
Now my angel has seen through my sins 
Thinking about my life 
When I was going insane 
Well I guess now I can take the pain 
It's not you; it's not me 
It's just the way that it is 
It's not you; it's not me 
I know the feeling is real 
And it's no exaggeration 

One time is not enough 
It's not enough 
And you know it's for the better of two 
One time is not enough 
It's not enough 
And you know it's for the better of two 
But what should I do? 

You could see right through me 
So I packed up my bags 
Getting sick and tired of my lies 
Waiting at the station feeling down on my luck 
With a picture of you stuck in my mind 
It's not you; it's not me 
It's just the way that it is 
It's not you; it's not me 
You got my mind in a twist 
And it's no exaggeration 

One time is not enough 
It's not enough 
And you know it's for the better of two 
One time is not enough 
It's not enough 
And you know it's for the better of two 
But what should I do 

When I was loosing my face 
I never really cared 
I guess I got to pull myself together now 
I know, it really drives you crazy 
It's time will be alright 
I know it's a lie 
Never wanted to say goodbye 
And you know 
In my heart and my soul 
I've got no place to go 

One time is not enough 
It's not enough 
And you know it's for the better of two 
One time is not enough 
It's not enough 
And you know it's for the better of two 
But what should I do?
