He was raised with the Bible 
Living up to their demands 
Such a flawless deciple 
Living under their command 
Now he's breaking all the rules 
Like a hurricane gone wild 
And he never was so cruel 
He's just a perfect fool 
Is that a reason? 
A reason to live? 

He don't need your touch 
Life gives just enough 
No religion and indecision 
He don't need your touch 
He don't need your touch 

Kneeling back into the shadows 
Hiding from the dead of night 
There's no sense in facing sorrows 
No ones gonna put up a fight 
Cause he never will forget 
The evil that has weakened his mind 
But it's nothing you can see 
That's tearing him apart 
Give him a reason, a reason to start 

He don't need your touch 
Life gives just enough 
No religion and indecision 
He don't need your touch 
Don't need your touch 
He gets just enough 
No touch 
Back in the shadows 

Will there always be the anger 
That's raging in his heart? 
Will he be ready? 
To make a new start. 
He don't need your touch 
Life gives just enough 
No religion and indecision 
He don't need your touch
