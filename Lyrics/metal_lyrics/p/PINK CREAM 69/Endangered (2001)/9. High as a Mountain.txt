Got to face the truth 
And change the way I live 
Thrown away my youth 
And all I had to give 
So now I choose my destiny 
The game of life has followed me 
I'll cast aside my misery 
And make the rules so I can see 

Cause I'm High as a mountain 
Flying high above to touch the sky 
High as a mountain 
Only peace of mind can make me cry 

Now I'm feeling strong so strong 
And going were I choose 
Even if I'm wrong 
I know that I can't lose 
Will future set me free? 
And take away its hold on me 
Innocence will hold the key 
And all I ask is one last plea 

Cause I'm high as a mountain 
Flying high above and touch the sky 
High as a mountain 
Tell me if I'm alive 
High as a mountain 
Flying high above to touch the sky 
High as a mountain 
Only peace of mind can make me cry 

Why does it make me cry? 

I've seen the goodness turn to bad 
I've seen the happy change to sad 
I've felt the heat turn into cold 
But now I'm stronger 

Got to face the truth? 
Oh I don't know 
Thrown away my youth 
I'm not wasted 

High as a mountain 
Flying high above to touch the sky 
High as a mountain 
Tell me I'm alive 
Cause I' m High as a mountain 
Flying high above and touch the sky 
High as a mountain 
Only peace of mind 
High as a mountain 
Flying high above to touch the sky 
High as a mountain 
Only peace of mind can make me cry
