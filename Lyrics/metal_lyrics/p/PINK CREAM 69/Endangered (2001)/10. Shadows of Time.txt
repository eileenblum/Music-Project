Don't remember when I came here 
Was it in a dream? 
All the thoughts that now surround me 
Are not what they seem? 
Is there anybody out there? 
Who could know my face? 
In this vision no decision 

Shadow's of time 
Cast away the darkness for my eyes 
So I can fight the good fight 
Shadow's of time 
Seems that I've been lost a thousand years 
And I will fight the good fight 
Over shadow's of time 

In the dark I search the answer 
Twisting in my mind 
Pessimism in your laughter 
Makes you so unkind 
Memories are waking in me 
Guilty is my plea 
In this vision no decision 

Shadow's of time 
Cast away the darkness for my eyes 
So I can fight the good fight 
Shadow's of time 
Seems that I've been lost a thousand years 
And I will fight the good fight 
Over shadow's of time 

So I face the final curtain 
With this endless dream 
In my vision no decision 

Shadow's of time 
Cast away the darkness for my eyes 
So I can fight the good fight 
Shadow's of time 
Seems that I've been lost a thousand years 
And I will fight the good fight 
And I cant stop these 
Shadow's of time 
Break away from what I left behind 
So I can fight the good fight 
Shadow's of time 
Take me through another thousand years 
So I can fight the good fight 
Over Shadow's of time
