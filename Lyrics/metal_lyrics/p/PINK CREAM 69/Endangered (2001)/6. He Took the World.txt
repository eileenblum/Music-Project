The quicksand of hatred has swept him away 
Off to a land in the sky 
A magical vision to worship and pray 
Something to make them all blind 
Voices they echo around in the wind 
Saying "you're one of a kind. 
The others deny you and lead you astray 
Playing around with your mind" 

Feeling so grand in his mighty domain 
With all the power to make you the same 

He took the world, into his hands 
He took the world of the next man 
The blackened light, would leave no trace 
The blackened light hiding disgrace 
He took the world, He took the land 
He took the world 

So witness the truth now the damage is done 
Silence has branded you gone 
The fathers' own evil is passed to the son 
Although the line has been drawn 
Now out of the dark it will rise and will fall 
Leaving the demons behind 
The promise now broken, and bound from it all 
Trying to choose for mankind 

Raising his hand in this mighty domain 
Trying the best just to make you insane 

He took the world, into his hands 
He took the world and he gave his command 
The blackened light, would leave no trace 
The blackened light that would hide the disgrace 
He took the world, into his hands 
He took the world and he gave his command 
The blackened light, would leave no trace 
The blackened light that would hide the disgrace 
He took the world, 
I guess the damage is done 

Now he's raising his hand in this mighty domain 
Trying the best just to make you insane 
All of the people are playing his game 

He took the world, into his hands 
He took the world and he gave his command 
The blackened light, would leave no trace 
The blackened light that would hide the disgrace 
He took the world, into his hands 
He took the world and he gave his command 
The blackened light, would leave no trace 
The blackened light that would hide the disgrace 
He took the world
