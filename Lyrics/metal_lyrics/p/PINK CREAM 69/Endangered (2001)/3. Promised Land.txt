When I look across this broken land 
And try to understand 
Why the human race 
Should loose their grace 
In this promised land 

Now we've seen all the heartache 
It turned into shame 
Cause there's no one to take the blame 

Do you remember life before the storm? 
Bound for glory, and the deeds that we'd perform 
Were stuck in a landslide, and there'll be no turning back 
We'll answer the questions, 
As we drift along the road to nowhere 

Who's playing the guardian angel? 
Watching over 
In this promised land 
Just look to a new horizon 
Rise above you 
In this promised land 
Who's playing the guardian angel? 
Watching over 
In this promised land 
Just look to a new horizon 
Now the future is in your hands 

They show no redemption, remorse or even sorrow 
There'll be no exception, when you're waiting for tomorrow 
Were stuck in the crossfire, could it be we'll never wake 
They're breaking our empire, 
And they're taking all that they could take 

Who's playing the guardian angel? 
Watching over 
In this promised land 
Just look to a new horizon 
Rise above you 
In this promised land 
Who's playing the guardian angel? 
Watching over 
In this Promised Land 
Just look to a new horizon 
Is it really a shame that were taking the blame? 
When the future is in your hands 

If I close my eyes 
I know I'll see 
The sun begin to rise 
Cause I've know the joy 
Of self contentment 
In this paradise 
Oh in this paradise 
This paradise 

Won't somebody tell me? 

Who's playing the guardian angel? 
Watching over 
In this promised land 
Just look to a new horizon 
Rise above you 
In this promised land 
Who's playing the guardian angel? 
Watching over 
In this promised land 
Just look to a new horizon 
Now the future is in your hands
