Your, brothers sisters are crying out to you 
Take, time and listen what else can you do 
Screaming for they're destiny 
The future holds the key 
Got to save they're dignity 
Let's find a way find a way 
Reach out and free your soul

Shout, shout it out 
Turn your back and be disgraced 
Shout it out 
Give the people what they need 
Shout, shout it out 
Raise your hands and shout it out 

Heal, all the blood shed 
In this crazy dream 
Save all the goodness 
And there self esteem 
Searching for there liberty

Say goodbye to poverty

Turn your back and be disgraced 
Shout it out

Shout, shout it out 
Roll the dice and shout it out 
Let it out, spit it out, and scream it out 
Shout it out 
Let it out, spit it out, scream it out
