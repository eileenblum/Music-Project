I remember a time before
But life got in the way
Still the future was written in the stars
Then the circumstances changed again
And I was on my own
No solution, I wallow in my shame

I am blinded by this paradise that I'm living
A fantasy I create
I'm no more than the other man
The other man
The illusions of reality have me jaded
There's nothing upon my plate
I'm no more than the other man
The other man

Accusations of who and why
And what is left to do
Don't get in my way, I'll blame it all on you
Each night I rest my head
Conceiving thoughts I try to understand
My solutions are all written in the sand...

Moments of rage lead me astray and then I
Try to ease my mind
It's been tearing me apart for so long
Trials by fire should take me higher but I
Carry on a wayward son
I'm holding out for you

I'm no more than the other man
Still the future is written in the stars
Then this world came along
And took it all away
Now I wallow in my shame
No solution to gain, yeah...
