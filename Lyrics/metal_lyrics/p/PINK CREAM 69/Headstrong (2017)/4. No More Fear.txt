Sometimes those pretty dreams can keep
The soul alive
You will find your way
There no borders to the things that you aspire
If you don't deny then you'll defy

No more heinous goodbyes
No more mountains to climb
No confusion, disillusion
No more fear in your eyes

There no reasons for the thing that you dismay
And no time for shame (gotta take the blame)
A lack of certainty can only lead to pain
If you let the lies be your demise

In your darkness will be light
It's a power you posses
Another wrong another right
Like the spirit you will fly

Walk away in the face of danger
Those trivial cries will not satisfy

Like the spirit you will fly
No more fear in your eyes
You will find your way
It's a power you posses...
