There's a fire spreading out across the land
And the situations getting out of hand
We can only hope that some of us will stand
Walking a life wire

Let the winds beneath our wings deliver us
To a place with no injustice and no fuss
Save the innocent, there's no one left to trust

In the absence of the sun
We won't hide from anyone
While the rest are crying for a guiding light
We bow to none

There's no solitary soul for us to praise
Unassisted - carry on throughout the days
We don't need those regulations anyways

We won't bow to anyone
Not a soul survivor, no!
Just an ordinary man you'd like to be
With no reign and no divine authority
No religion, well that's fine with me!
