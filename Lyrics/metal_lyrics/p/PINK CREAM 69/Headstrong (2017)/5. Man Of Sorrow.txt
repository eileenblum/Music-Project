He will leave through the door in which he came
Head bowed in shame, he gets the blame
Through the fight for his innocence was strong
His unsung song was sung so wrong

Ans so he hides, in the heart of the city
Staring out the open window, he just cries
As days pass by, he's not eager to greet them
But his hope's the only tonic that still drives...

The days are lonely and the nights are desolate
Hanging out upon the wire
Aiming to escape from this pretend Babylon
But it's much too late, another life he must create

He is a man of sorrow
Unoccupied, dissatisfied
Living alone with his bottle and his doom
In the abyss of eternal desire

Traveled down the roads, signaled 'danger up ahead'
They lead hum right into disaster
How the mortal soul isn't going anywhere
Cut he's much too late, and now oblivion is all that awaits

He's just alone in the dark
Life is drifting on and on
Pieces are scattered everywhere
There's no absolution

Yes he's much too late, like every man he must bear his own fate

He will leave through the door in which he came
And so he hides, in the heart of the city
Standing out the open window, he just cries
