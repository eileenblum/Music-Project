We were lost inside the circle of never ending fear
Of the next tomorrow
And they label us as traitors because we interfere
With there greedy sideshow

I can't take it anymore
Time to break down every door

We were confined
To speak our mind
But now the silence is broken
We walked alone,
Kept in the zone
But now the silence is broken
The whistle blows
Let it blow!

So the chain has been disjointed, we are the missing link
Held it all together
Our situation changed now we're standing on the brink
And we've lost our tether

Nowhere left to go
I'm living free but I'm on my own
No one seems to care
I'm not going anywhere
So I hide my tears away
Are you ever gonna see me again...
