I've got a problem with your madness
Always lying, always lying
Point of concerns fade into blackness
So evading, so evading

You never cared about the things we've said
You never cared about the things you've done
You never cared because the world is crashing down

'Cause you're a backstabbing, dirty rotten,
Double-crossing mastermind
You're just a bloodsucker, stuck between the
Cheeks of what they call mankind
I'll be waiting for the chance: take a final stance,
Vengeances won't be yours, but mine
'Cause you're a backstabbing, dirty rotten,
Double-crossing mastermind
Rolling down the road to nowhere

How many times can you dodge bullet now?
So deceiving, so deceiving
Lifeless and cold on your stage you take a bow
Unconvincing, unconvincing

You never cared about the things we do
You never cared if all the world stop turning
You never to stop to think about the words you find
