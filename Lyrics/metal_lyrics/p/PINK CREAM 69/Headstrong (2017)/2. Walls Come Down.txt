The game is over
Chip on your shoulder
All said and done but you can't stop grieving
Nobody chose to humiliate you
Oh what a shame that world is catching on
You never tried to soften your words
Twisted your terms, took us for fools
And all you know is what you've been told

You believe, you believe

It's the universal exodus
These lies are just too much for us
When the walls come tumbling down
Waiting for your final hour
We must obstruct your only power
When the walls come tumbling down

You're on a roll now
Got so far somehow
Just waiting for the chance that's coming
Don't mind the mockery
It's your philosophy
That simple-minded men can't see through you

You set the tone to make them so strong
Strengthen how they feel, milk them for trust
High on the stage to make them perceive

You believe, you believe

There's a message to be told:
We can pick the wounds of every single adversary
Long are gone the days of old
Keep the faith inside your mind, in you mind
