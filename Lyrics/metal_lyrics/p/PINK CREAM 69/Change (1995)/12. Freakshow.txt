Cold thoughts unite
Got the feeling the bug is screaming
She's got Asia on hear mind
He is trying to get her high

The sun can't shine
The light that you've looking for

Stories from her friends
Of a world where people care
Share the last peace of bread with the suffering
Carry the scare until you die

The sun can't shine
The light that you've looking for

FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW
FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW

She takes a blow back from her father
He tries to make her high
More than this daughter, his lover
Dangerous feelings fly

FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW
FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW

The sun can't shine
The light that you've looking for

Break free from this cage
If that's what you're looking for

FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW
FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW

Looking for a place to hide
Looking for a place to hide

FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW
FREAKSHOW JUST A FREAKSHOW

She takes a blow back from her father
He tries to make her high
More than this daughter, his lover
Dangerous feelings fly
FLY
