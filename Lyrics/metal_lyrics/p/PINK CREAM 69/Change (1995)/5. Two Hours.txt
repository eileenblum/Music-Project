Got to face this morning
Put a bag over my head
Won't you take a long walk with me
I'm lonely, feeling scared

I've got two hours
To justify my time

Never saw it coming
Did what any man would do
Now I can't get out so easy
They will never know the truth

I've got two hours
To justify my time
Just two hours
To make the devil run
I've done all my trying

Someone above, someone above...
Anyone

Just two hours
To justify my time
Just two hours
To make the devil run
I've done all my trying

I know that I will make the papers
But I'm an innocent man
In the same situation, I'm sure
You would feel the same
Cause I'm not guilty
So listen...

Just Two Hours
To justify my time
Just two hours
To make the devil run
I've done all my trying
Two hours
Now my day is done
