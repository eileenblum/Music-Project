So many people, they feel the hate
So many problems get in the way
So if you're asking, the time is right
To quit our worries and break your lies

You keep on looking for another fight
Is it something I said or something I did?
You keep on looking for another time, another place
Is it something I said or something I did?

I hear them talking, what do thy say?
I see them moving, no place to stay
But can we help them, that's how it is
Misunderstanding won't help a bit

You keep on looking for another fight
Is it something I said or something I did?
You keep on looking for another time, another place
Is it something I said or something I did?

You keep on looking for another fight
Is it something I said or something I did?
You keep on looking for another time, another place
Is it something I said or something I did?

Too many people, what do they pray?
When all the people get blown away
So if you're asking, there comes a time
You'd better worry, things just ain't
Fine, fine, fine

You keep on looking for another fight
Is it something I said or something I did?
You keep on moving to the other side
You keep on looking for another time, another place
Something I said
Something they said
Something I said
Something I did
