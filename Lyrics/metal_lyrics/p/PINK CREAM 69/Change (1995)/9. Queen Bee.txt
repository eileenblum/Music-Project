Done my time I'm guilty of nothing
My fighting days are over
Faces names they change so fast
Come on Lord I feel much stronger
Too many days just wasting my time
Thinking that I was wrong
Lady, I'm not the kind to get stuck in the mud

Queen bee
Are you telling me that you're lonely
Queen bee
Well you got b out of your mind
Queen bee
Got to believe what you tell me
Queen bee
Won't you let me out of your hive
For the last time
You ain't a friend of mine, no

I've tasted the gutter like a peace of meat
That you chewed and spit away
I can't believe that I witness your greed
I'm stronger by the day
Lord have mercy on this pitiful soul
It never should be this way
Lady, I'm not the kind to get stuck in the mude

Queen bee
Are you telling me that you're lonely
Queen bee
Well you got b out of your mind
Queen bee
Got to believe what you tell me
Queen bee
Won't you let me out of your hive
For the last time

I've tasted the gutter like a peace of meat
That you chewed and spit away
I can't believe that I witness your greed
I'm stronger by the day

You can break down the door
You can drill into my mind
You can run me into the ground
Now I wonder that I'm stronger, wonder
Now I'm stronger
Stronger

Queen bee
Are you telling me that you're lonely
Queen bee
Well you got b out of your mind
Queen bee
Got to believe what you tell me
Queen bee
Won't you let me out of your hive
For the last time
You ain't a friend of mine
A friend of mine, a friend of mine:
