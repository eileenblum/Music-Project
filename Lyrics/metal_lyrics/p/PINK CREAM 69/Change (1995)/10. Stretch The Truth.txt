Making promises I just can't keep
Breaking loose I pray to sleep
Friends they run and then they hide
You could never know the weight is real

When you talk do you hear your lies?
No, I never realized
Do you think that you could change?
I dream away, I dream away

Stretch the truth and roll your eyes
Blind man's bluff was always my disguise
But I don't care

Aching bones they paralize
Watching friends they victimise
Get the gun and pull my trigger
Poisoned thoughts help feed my desire

When you talk do you hear your lies?
No, I never realized
Do you think that you could change?
I dream away, I dream away

Stretch the truth and roll your eyes
Blind man's bluff was always my disguise
I dream away, I dream away

I dream away, I dream away
Stretch the truth and roll your eyes
Blind man's bluff was always my disguise
I dream away, I dream away...
