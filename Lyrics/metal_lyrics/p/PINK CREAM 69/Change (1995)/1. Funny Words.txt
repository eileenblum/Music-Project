somedays i smell the stench of the day
pull the skin from my face
no regrets i don't see in their disgrace

i don't want to see it all my way
give me the key to unlock my fate
i don't want to see it
i don't want to see it

funny words they pass me by
my head it rolls into the sky
tell me something i don't know
the preacher said that he may die
funny words they pass me by
my head it rolls into the sky
tell me something i don't know
the teacher said that she could fly

they're always so blatent
when there?s something to cry about
pull my hand from my head
the pain ruins me
like the sweets that took my teeth away

i don't want to see it all my way
give me the key to unlock my fate
i don't want to see it
i don't want to see it

funny words they pass me by
my head it rolls into the sky
tell me something i don't know
the preacher said that he may die
funny words they pass me by
my head it rolls into the sky
tell me something i don't know
the teacher said that she could fly

i don't want to see it
i don't want to see it

funny words they pass me by
my head it rolls into the sky
tell me something i don't know
the preacher said that he may die
funny words they pass me by
my head it rolls into the sky
tell me something i don't know
the teacher said that she may fly
the preacher said that he may fly
he may die
he may fly
