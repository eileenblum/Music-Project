Take this hand
And get back to the ground
Feel the life
Running through your hands

Don't know when tomorrow comes
Not sure where I should be
Don't know when tomorrow comes
But I live my life
Cause I need my destiny

Break the land
And peel away the life
Steel the greed
Maybe God will help win the fight

Don't know when tomorrow comes
Not sure where I should be
Don't know when tomorrow comes
But I live my life
Cause I need my destiny

Take my hand
I'll lead you to the place
I will make a start
I will play a part

Don't know when tomorrow comes
Not sure where I should be
Don't know when tomorrow comes
Not sure where I should be
Don't know when tomorrow comes
But I live my life
Cause I need my destiny

We need a new control
So people know the score
We need it to bite in everyone
Like a BUG
