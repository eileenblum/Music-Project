dangerous feelings flowing through his veins
the picture's getting clearer
the truth starts to stain
no more living for nothing
you break your back just to get through the day
the time has come for him to face the day
darkness hides away fear
lick the wound and pray
too many days running naked
for all mankind

into the light of day
into the light of day

patience always leaves him so uptight
soon the master speaks
his voice strong with delight
no more living for nothing
his pain is still digging away
reaching out he tries to change the game

into the light of day
into the light of day

something came into his life
and told him they were wrong
never trust the higher paid
cause they?re the worst of all
day and night they move so slow
the end is what i fear
hate is just another pain
and pain's a friend of mine

get him something, he's lonely
screaming voices they pray
he sees the light of the lonely
for all mankind

into the light of day
into the light of day
