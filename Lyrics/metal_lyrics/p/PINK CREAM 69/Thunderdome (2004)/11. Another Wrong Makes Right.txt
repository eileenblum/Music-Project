There's a man with just a head - He tells me it's all right
To believe that all the evil men - Will turn to run in fright
So he asks me if I'm not too young, to really understand?
Then he tells me with a plastic smile: "tune in late tonight again"
Whoa... In a world of madness
We finally found a way
To bring justice into light - via satellite 
Whoa... It's a ghostly sadness
But there's always a price to pay
And the blindness shows the ignorance of man
Now the silence has gone
And I'm crying out with a message to the ones:
Load your guns! Load your guns before the night!
Still you need to be strong
And believe in all of the system we belong
Load your guns! Load your guns before the night!
Another wrong makes right
Focus your eyes and dream away the sanity
Capitalize on all that you stand for - So sure
Whoa: Such a world of madness
And nothing will ever change
But I don't believe we'll ever be the same
Now the silence has gone
And I'm crying out with a message to the ones:
Load your guns! Load your guns before the night!
Still you need to be strong
And believe in all of the system we belong
Load your guns! Load your guns before the night!
Another wrong makes right
Another victim to the fight - another wrong to make it right
Another victim to the fight - another wrong to make it right
Another victim to the fight - another wrong to make it right
Now the silence has gone
And I'm crying out with a message to the ones:
Load your guns! Load your guns before the night!
Still you need to be strong
And believe in all of the system we belong
Load your guns! (Load you guns!) Load your guns before the night!
Another wrong makes right
Another wrong makes it right
So keep your guns by your side
Another wrong makes it right
Makes it right
