Stand up, looking pretty
Another face on the production line
Shot down, such a pity
You make a living serving cherry wine
I can see that we've got no choice
But to dismiss you from us all
-Another ones on the way
Anyway, by the end of the day
It's kind of good to see you crawl
-Ain't gonna get no second chance
I only hope we can buy some time
Before the ratings start to fall
Who's the master of the plan
In this Psycho Wonderland?
In the Thunderdome
You've got the right to win or loose
In the Thunderdome
You've got a choice but you can't choose
In the Thunderdome
Behind a shroud of circumstance
In the Thunderdome
In the Thunderdome
Bright lights make you flirty
You say you want to be a friend of mine
Backstage, getting dirty
You got your status doing overtime
I can see that we've got no choice
But to dismiss you from us all
-Another ones on the way
Anyway, by the end of the day
It's kind of good to see you crawl
-Ain't gonna get no second chance
I only hope we can buy some time
Before the ratings start to fall
Who's the master of the plan
In this Psycho Wonderland?
In the Thunderdome
You've got the right to win or loose
In the Thunderdome
You've got a choice but you can't choose
In the Thunderdome
Behind a shroud of circumstance
In the Thunderdome
In the Thunderdome
In this Psycho Wonderland...
In the Thunderdome
You've got the right to win or loose
In the Thunderdome
You've got a choice but you can't choose
In the Thunderdome
Behind a shroud of circumstance
In the Thunderdome
'Cause you can never settle for less
In the Thunderdome
Watch out for the martyr 
'Cause he'll be flooding your empty screen
In the Thunderdome
Can't look but you gotta
Another day in a broken dream - so helpless
In the Thunderdome
Keep pusing the limits
Until the best of them play a round
In the Thunderdome
Keep making the headlines
Until there's only the underground
Cut the lights now
In this Thunderdome...
