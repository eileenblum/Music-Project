Sit here and wonder why I've got no place to go
Been waiting so long, I don't know what I've been waiting for
Too much consistency has stopped me in my tracks
Too many reasons why there ain't no turning back
I'm chasing this dream, as hard as it seems
And I've had to understand what it means
Keep pushing on to where I belong
To where I come alive
Goodbye Carnaby Road! - Where I lost my mind
Drove me out on my own - Left it all behind
Now my moment has come - Till the end of time
No more yesterdays - It's just the only way
Only way - Lifetime holiday!
Still running headstrong, but the stones don't break my stride
I've fell to pieces, but I've never lost my pride
Into the jungle of the Greedy and the Meek
Against the powers of the obvious I speak
I'm chasing this dream, as hard as it seems
And I've had to understand what it means
Keep pushing on to where I belong
To where I come alive
Goodbye Carnaby Road! - Where I lost my mind
Drove me out on my own - Left it all behind
Now my moment has come - Till the end of time
No more yesterdays - It's just the only way
Only way, so I pray, I'm going on a lifetime holiday!
I've been waiting so long, I got no place to go
Before I fall to pieces, yeah!
Goodbye Carnaby Road! - I've been chasing a dream
Drove me out on my own - And it's not all that it seems
Now my moment has come - It's a road to nowhere
Too many reasons why there ain't no going back
Goodbye Carnaby Road! - I don't want to stay
Drove me out on my own - So I've gone away
Now my moment has come - Till the end of time
No more yesterdays - It's just the only way
Only way to a lifetime holiday, yeah!
To a lifetime holiday, yeah!
Come on now!
