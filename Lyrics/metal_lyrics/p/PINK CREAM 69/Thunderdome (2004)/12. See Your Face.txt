Wake up in the morning, so blinded by the light
That I just lie and wait for the night
Years of precious moments don't add up to a day
Now I just feel you drifting away
If I see your face again, with a smile that's just pretend
I'll be living on the edge of paradise
If you're looking for place to enjoy my own disgrace
I'll be living on the edge of paradise
I don't mind believing in something I can't see 
But if your not here there's nothing for me
And I don't need a reason - I'm gonna make you understand
These words can't change the feeling at hand
If I see your face again, with a smile that's just pretend
I'll be living on the edge of paradise
If you're looking for place to enjoy my own disgrace
I'll be living on the edge of paradise
Yes I know, I've got a lot of complications - a lot of the time
Yes I know, you've got a lot on your mind
Ooh yeah
So many questions with too many answers
I don't need a reason when I see your face you'll understand
Places, so many places
Changing the faces of the people I used to know
Show me, why can't you show me?
Now that you know me. There's somewhere I've got to go
If I see your face again, with a smile that's just pretend
I'll be living on the edge of paradise
If you're looking for place to enjoy my own disgrace
I'll be living on the edge of paradise
Your paradise, your paradise
Yes I know, I've got a lot of complications - a lot of the time
Yes I know, you've got so much on your mind
