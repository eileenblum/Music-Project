When the clock strikes at midnight
I can hear the engine turning round
Another day, another night
So I must sign the book that would lie in the hands of my fate
With the pride in my heart 
My soul and my mind can now
Cross through the world into light
But I've travelled so far
And followed the signs
Here I am
Gonna take a chance to be free
Gonna be the future for me
Running with the danger
So follow me
Here I am
Living in a world full of pain
All I want to do is maintain
Shaking off the anger
It's killing me
Here I am
I don't fear the tangled grace
The symptoms of a faith that we have weakened
The only strength I've displaced
I've been told holds the book that would lie in the hands of your fate
With the pride in my heart 
My soul and my mind can now
Cross through the world oh so blind
And I've travelled so far
So show me the signs
Here I am
Gonna take a chance to be free
Gonna be the future for me
Running with the danger
So follow me
Here I am
Living in a world full of pain
All I want to do is maintain
Shaking off the anger
It's killing me
Here I am
Through the madness I'll keep on searching
In the future were dreams and memories
Come together for they will be no more
In this world full of pain
Sign the book that would lie in the hands of my fate
With the pride in my heart 
My soul and my mind can now
Cross through the world into light
But I've travelled so far
And followed the signs
Here I am
Gonna take a chance to be free
Gonna be the future for me
Running with the danger
So follow me
Here I am
Living in a world full of pain
All I want to do is maintain
Shaking off the anger
It's killing me
Here I am
Gonna take a chance to be free
Gonna be the future for me
Running with the danger
So follow me
Here I am
Living in a world full of pain
All I want to do is maintain
Shaking off the anger
And now I'm free
Here I am
