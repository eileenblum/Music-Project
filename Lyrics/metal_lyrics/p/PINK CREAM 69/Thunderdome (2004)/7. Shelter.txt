You've been trying to believe in what you do
Always looking for a reason to go through
This incompatibility has
Got you focused on another dream, and yeah
Giving meaning to the purpose just don't kick
All this running round in circles makes you sick
There's allot of technicalities and
There's allot of things you just don't see, and yeah
Cause I want to know -
Will you ever find the way:?
Follow your heart, follow your senses 
Walking a one way road - longing shelter
It might be hard, it might be easy
Walking a one way road - longing shelter from the storm
Times are changing but song remains the same
Kind of dated, kind of retro, kind of lame
Do you really even understand why
Nothing's going quite the way you planned, and yeah
Are you ready to indulge into the truth -
Of the consequences captured by your youth?
Take a good look at the way you're going
Are you moving without even knowing? Yeah!
Cause I want to know -
Will you ever find the way:?
Follow your heart, follow your senses 
Walking a one way road - longing shelter
It might be hard, it might be easy
Walking a one way road - longing shelter from the storm
A one way road - longing shelter from the storm 
A one way road - longing shelter from the storm 
From the storm:.
Cause I want to know -
Will you ever find the way:?
Follow your heart, follow your senses 
Walking a one way road - longing shelter
It might be hard, it might be easy
Walking a one way road - longing shelter from the storm
A one way road - longing shelter from the storm 
A one way road - longing shelter from the storm 
Give me shelter!
