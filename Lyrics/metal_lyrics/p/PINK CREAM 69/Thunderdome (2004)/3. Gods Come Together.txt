Now I kneel into an empty corridor
And I'm chasing down the ugly beast
His teeth are razor sharp, so they're telling me
And I'm soon to be his final feast
Then I walk inside into an open door
And I'm moving slow just like a snake
I'm not the only one with a loaded gun
And I soon wil be the forgotten son
Do you hear those distant sirens?
Candid eyes admire the violence
Now's the time for all the gods to come together
Now I see with no exception
Now's the time and all the gods must join together
Now I dream, the walls are falling down
So you just sit at home with your remote control
And your eyes are focused on the screen
The danger's over there, you don't even care
'Cause the camera takes you everywhere
Do you hear those distant sirens?
Candid eyes admire the violence
Now's the time for all the gods to come together
Now I see with no exception
Now's the time and all the gods must join together
Now I dream, the walls are falling down
We never understand
Still we try to make demands
On a common circumstance
Look into the mirror of your mind
-Is it too enchanting?
Deep beneath the surface you will find
-We are so demanding
Listen to the whispers of your heart
-Can we be mistaken?
Look into the fury they call art
-For a new beginning...
We're not blind!!!
Would you know the color of fear
When it floods your screen?
And do you hear those distant sirens?
Candid eyes admire the violence
Now's the time for all the gods to come together
Now I see with no exception
Now's the time and all the gods must join together
Now I dream, the walls are falling down
