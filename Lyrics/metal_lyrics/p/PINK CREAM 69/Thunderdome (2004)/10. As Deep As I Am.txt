(What good is a laugh, without a smile?)
A light shines to the floor
And then it fades away
Like the floods I've made before
Yes, the river is my guide:
To know all that I know
A curse that can't be undone
Damns are built to hold back the overflow
But the river breaks aside:
All that I wanted
Was to really understand
And all that I needed
Was a little patience 
As deep as I am, as deep as I am, as deep as I am
Will you ever be as deep as I am, as deep as I am, as deep as I am?
I never felt right, I never felt wrong, as deep as I am, as deep as I am
An infinite night, an unfinished song, as deep as I am:
The thoughts seem to rush out of me
To fill an endless void
To keep the calm where there's usually tragedy
Yes the river is my guide:
Alone, I find the way
But I can't convince myself
To take a chance for a new opportunity 
Like the river took my pride:
All that I wanted
Was to live my hopeless dream
And that's why I needed
Your complete attention
As deep as I am, as deep as I am, as deep as I am
Will you ever be as deep as I am, as deep as I am, as deep as I am?
I never felt right, I never felt wrong, as deep as I am, as deep as I am
An infinite night, an unfinished song, as deep as I am:
You're the last thing on my mind
Been waiting so damn long
No excuses to be made
So infatuated 
As deep as I am, as deep as I am, as deep as I am
Will you ever be as deep as I am, as deep as I am, as deep as I am?
I never felt right, I never felt wrong, as deep as I am,
In the darkness of an infinite night, an unfinished song, as deep as I am:
It must have been my destiny
It must have been the best for me
And no one's gonna change this, as deep as I am
It could have been my destiny
And no one else will ever know but me
And I'm not gonna change this, as deep as I am - no:
