Give us a reason to go down
With all these patriots around
And we know
Everyday is like a haunting nightmare
Everyday you hear the sound
Let the pounding Thunder
Make them stop and wonder
With the essence of this Retro lullaby
Like the final pages
Written through the ages
We will never end this Retro lullaby
Not out of mind, but out of sight
Beneath the shelter of the night
And you know
Only we can feed your raging hunger
In this dominion of delight
Let the pounding Thunder
Make them stop and wonder
With the essence of this Retro lullaby
Like the final pages
Written through the ages
We will never end this Retro lullaby
It takes you away
And breaks you away from it all
Our spirits will fly
To the clouds of minds eye
And nothing will keep us from coming around once again!
We will make them hear...
The pounding Thunder
Make them stop and wonder
With the essence of this Retro lullaby
Like the final pages
Written through the ages
We will never end this Retro lullaby
Like there's no tomorrow 
There will be no sorrow
In the verses of this Retro lullaby
Bound to this illusion
I've made my conclusion
We will never end this Retro lullaby
Yes, we'll take you away
With this Retro lullaby
Oh yes, our spirits will fly - through your mind
