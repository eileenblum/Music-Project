Know it's late and love has left me in this empty room
Should I gaze into the coming storm?
When I face the lies I need a drink to get me by 
And I taste the tears in your eyes
When the dust finally settles it's just you and me
On a journey to somewhere - I know we will find the way
There were days we were living and feeling so free
In our hearts there was meaning so how can it be?
Can you tell me why the sun don't shine?
Can you tell me why you left me blind?
Will you give me back again what's mine?
Cause I'll be waiting
Can you tell me why you ran away?
Were you looking for a better way?
To confront the life that you've betrayed
But that was yesterday - yesterday
Should I close the door on all the things that seem so right?
In my mind I shove them all away
When the day is done I try to wash the hurt inside 
Cause it makes me feel some kind of happiness
When the dust finally settles it's just you and me
On a journey to somewhere - I know we will find the way
There were days we were living and feeling so free
In our hearts there was meaning so how can it be?
Can you tell me why the sun don't shine?
Can you tell me why you left me blind?
Will you give me back again what's mine?
Cause I'll be waiting
Can you tell me why you ran away?
Were you looking for a better way?
To confront the life that you've betrayed
But that was yesterday - and I'm still here waiting, oh:
Oh, please tell me why
Can you tell me why the sun don't shine?
Can you tell me why you left me blind?
Will you give me back again what's mine?
Cause I'm still waiting for you
Can you tell me why you ran away?
Were you looking for a better way?
To confront the life that you've betrayed
But that was yesterday 
We were living, hearts were dreaming, there was meaning
That was yesterday
We were living, hearts were dreaming, there was meaning
But that was yesterday
That was yesterday
