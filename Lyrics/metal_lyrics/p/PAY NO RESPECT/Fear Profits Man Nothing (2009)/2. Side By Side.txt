Behind these walls you built you turned away from us
Gave up on everything with nothing to say to us
And now you hold the blade against your throat
Am I too late? or just too soon?

For those I love I will sacrifice
Through thick and thin I'll take my life
For those I love I will sacrifice
But if you throw it back in my face you will pay the price

When push comes to shove
I'll be the one to pick you back up
No matter how hard the fight
You wont fight alone I made a promise

I made a promise

We stand here unite forever by my side
Together we fight this is our time

There's no escape in fucking hiding
I hunt down memories that aren't worth saving
You're fading fast are you worth saving?
Your on your own coz I'm bored of fucking trying
Your on your own coz I'm bored of fucking trying

Promise

This is the promise I give to you
This is the promise were fucking through
This is the promise

You broke your fucking promise!
