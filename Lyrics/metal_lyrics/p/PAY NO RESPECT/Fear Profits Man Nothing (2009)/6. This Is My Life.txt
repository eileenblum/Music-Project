This is who I am
This is what I live for
No one can take that away from me (away from you)

This ain't right there's somethings wrong
We've put up with you for far too long
It's over your done
Go back where you came from

I'm myself for myself
And nothing can change the way I feel about me

Mistake your fake
And nothing can change the way I feel about you

This is who I am
This is what I live for
No one can take that away from me (away from you)

This ain't right there's somethings wrong
We've put up with you for far too long
It's over your done
Go back where you came from

This is my life, this is my reality
Not yours so stay the fuck away
From my friends and my family

Your standing on broken ground
