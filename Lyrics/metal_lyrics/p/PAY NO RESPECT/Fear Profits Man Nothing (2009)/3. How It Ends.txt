You think your fucking better than me
You think you fucking know it all
There comes a time in my life
I can't do this alone stand up and fight,
Stand up and fight

Just take a look around, at yourself at your friends
Were all in this together and this is how it fucking ends

Just take a look around, at yourself at your friends
Were all in this together and we'll take this to the bitter end

And now you've taken it all for yourself
You've gone and fucked it all up for everyone else
We will never forget your face and what you've done
Whats the fucking point in giving it up
Your always the first to run

What you've done
Your always the first to run

Forever I been picking you up
I never let you fall
And to stick the knife in my own back
It was me after all

I will never let you go
This is how it ends
This is how it fucking ends
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Let you go
