I just sat back and watched as
It slipped through your hands
Everything you once fucking had
Dies before for your eyes
Everything you once were
Died before me

And you act like nothings happened
While you piss it all away
The time has come for you to realise
You can't undo what you've done
Time wont heal this

Forever we've helped you, will you help us?
Forever a part of my life, you'll always have my trust

Am I dying or just waking up?
I should of known this from the start
Beat down and broken, left to die
This is my life falling apart

Time wont heal this

Is this the answer - that you seek
Is this the answer - that we bleed
Is this the answer - confide in me

We just sat back and watched as
It slipped through your fucking hands
