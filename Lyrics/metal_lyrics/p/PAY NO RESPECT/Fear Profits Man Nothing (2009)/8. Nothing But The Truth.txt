Giving up is never an option
A heart of steel I can never be broken
Forever true to the words that I have spoken

No one can't pretend they like what they see
Whats become of what we'll be
An endless friendship tragedy
Falls to the ground and for what?

You fucking liar taking off behind our backs
Yeah you fucking coward time to take it all back

I put my life on the line for this
Did you put your life on the line for this?
On line for me?

You can only push us so far
It's time to stand up and be counted
Time to make a fucking change
Coz this world ain't going no where

You've only hurt yourself by hurting me
And I've only hurt myself by hurting you
[X2]

I put my life on the line for this
Did you put your life on the line for this?
On line for me?

Giving up is never an option
A heart of steel I can never be broken
Forever true to the words that I have spoken

Nothing but the truth
