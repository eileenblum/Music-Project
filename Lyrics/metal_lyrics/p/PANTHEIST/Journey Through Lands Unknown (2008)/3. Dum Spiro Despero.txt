Dum spiro despero, via dolorosa

Bring me a sharp blade so I can cut
The strings that direct my moves
And like a puppet make me dance
To rhythms foreign to my limbs
The voice of desperation
Can stop this senseless wheel of life
I trust in suffering to free my tortured mind
Dum spiro despero, via dolorosa

The God of hope far behind IÂve left
The Enlightened One has shown me his path
His way IÂll follow, forsaking earthly pain
His wise words echo through my brain:
ÂGive up hope and everything you loveÂ

Strength I donÂt lack this decision to make
But trapped in torment, illusion and pain
Aeons of cruel suffering I foresee
Before my ignorance shall leave me
And my weary mind finally finds rest

Amida, give me the strength I need
To trust in your Other Power
And follow your noble path
Amida here I stand: am I worthy of your Pure Land?
