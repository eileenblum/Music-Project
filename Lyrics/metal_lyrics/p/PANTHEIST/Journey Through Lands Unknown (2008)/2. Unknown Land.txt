πατριδα μου ειναι η ψυχη
μες στην ερημια μονος μου γυρνω
ψαχνωντας να βρω τον χαμενο μου εαυτο...

ÂWhy is it that whenever words sweet like honey
Linger at the tip of my tongue
As I open my mouth, a song of joy to sing
Voices of evil and discontent torture my poor mind?Â

[The voice of reason:] ÂI am the voice of reason, the one and only truth
Your duties you will pay, there is no other way
But treason beckons here, as you allowed in
A very unwelcome guest who disturbed my rest
No, I can not tolerate another presence here
How can you feel the pain in my heart
When you havenÂt got one?
How can you see how much I suffer
When your eyes are shut?Â

[The voice of irrationality:] ÂIÂm your redemption so youÂd better listen:
I am sick of your figures and your calculated risks
I abhor your arrogance, when with zeal you project guilt
Only where logic dies you can find true happiness
So forget your dues and your duties, give your instincts free reinÂ

[The voice of Insanity:] ÂIn the land of the blind, IÂm the one-eyed king
While the two dogs fight for the same bone
IÂm seen running away with their meat
IÂm the voice of insanity, the genius of the universeÂ

[All:] Â O canÂt you see? IÂm the only way, your sole purpose in lifeÂ
