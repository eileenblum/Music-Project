In a God-forgotten land
Under the blazing hot sun
The stream of life showed me the way
Brighter than it ever had
I knelt to wash my weary head
But the water was ice-cold

In a God-forgotten land
Under the blazing hot sun
An angel sat under a tree
Just for a moment, to rest his wings
I knelt and touched his pale face
And tears fell from his eyes
