When suddenly at nights dark thoughts intrude your peaceful sleep
And your dreams wander in places long-forgotten
When visions of loss and regret engrave their ugly features on your skin
And you feel your purity slipping from your hands

When gradually you see the years youÂve lived turn into statues
-The hopes and dreams you had, now cast in stone
And when the years that come appear to be stillborn
-When you reach out to touch them they have already gone

Please donÂt let sorrow and grief make you bitter
With honesty and diligence search in your heart and find
The secret gift of your old innocence

And if by chance once, in a black winter night
As a casual trespasser on your way back home
Suddenly you spot a tragic figure writhed
DonÂt let me quench blinded by my guilt
But like a Good Samaritan
Lend me a hand
Salva me
