When I'Âll die, my surrendered soul
Shall descend to the dark realms of Hades
To be judged by my ancient gods
And the mighty king Minos
Will step forward from the dark
Silently to fix his gaze upon my mindÂs eye
His eyes like mirrors reflecting my whole past
But heÂll hang his head in sorrow
Tearful, he wonÂt bear the sightÂ

For eternal sorrow has enveloped my soul
Eternal sadness, opportunities lost
To show you how I feel

And so you will Âjust like everyone else-
One day stand before the mighty judge
Your soul full of hatred for the injustice done to you
You thought youÂd live forever
His eyes like mirrors reflecting your whole past
His head hung in sorrowÂfor he will be looking
At a hideous, unbearable sightÂ

For eternal apathy has withered your soul
Eternal suffering has been brought upon me
As I couldnÂt show you how I feel

Looking through the eyes of eternity at a failed past that canÂt be undone; struggling to understand how I lost my hope; I turn to look behind me, but my Eurydice is not there any moreÂI allow myself to float on the waves of solitude; rebirth is not an option, so I must accept. The wind shall carry away the memories, but the eye of eternity has seen it allÂ
