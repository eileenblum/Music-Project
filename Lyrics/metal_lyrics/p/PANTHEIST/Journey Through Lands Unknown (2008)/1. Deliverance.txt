When I awoke, the sun was high and the clouds had accepted their defeat
The lovely shores and the blue sky couldnÂt tell me where I was
I had to find out by myself

Then I stood up and a gentle breeze graced my sun-burned, naked skin
I collected fallen leaves to cover my fear and shame
And I went to find out who I was

I reached the hilltop under the rumbling thunder
And as my eyes wandered over the fertile landscape
I couldnÂt understand what higher powers brought me here
To this deserted isle so long undiscovered

And suddenly I saw them: warriors from the Underworld charging my way
On dark steeds, blowing their trumpets
Declaring war to the intruder who invaded their island
A fight ensued and wounded I fell to the ground
My blood contaminating their soil
Like poison it flowed, destroying their earth

And as I fell to the ground and life-force was abandoning my cold body
I heard the wind whisper: ÂFor every precious gift there is a price to payÂ

When I was reborn I knew that the deserted isle was mine
And as I looked inside my soul, the peace I needed I couldnÂt find
But I found the desire to embrace my inner world
