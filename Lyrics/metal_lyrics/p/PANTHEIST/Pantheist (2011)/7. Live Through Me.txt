If you ever stay awake at nights
Agonizing over all these dreams you left behind
If you looked back and you found you have never been yourself
Did your thoughts go back to me?

Have you ever thought of a future without me?
Could there be a life, a happy life somewhere else?
If I tumble from a bridge looking at the rainbow
Would you roam unchained and free?

A rainbow will appear and youâll get your chance, youâll see
You will find your way as you are searching in the dark
Deep within your soul, a fire slowly burns
A sacred shrine, your destiny

You live, live through me
You see through my eyes
How could you ever be free
Until the end will us part?
