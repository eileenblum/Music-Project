Remember when you said that you donât need me any more
Success had finally come your way
You smiled and waved at me as you got into your car
A gallant knight held the door open

Alice what have you become? You have tumbled from your footing

Three years have passed since then but success abandoned you
Your empty gaze stares into infinity
What happened to your dreams? The flower has withered on your hair
And someone said you want to see me

Like a statue youâve become that has fallen from its pedestal

Fall, with pleasure I will push you and I wonât be there to help you
For all these years I have been dying now Iâd like to see you crying
Fall, I wonât shed a tear for you, I donât want and I donât need you
For all these years I have been dying now Iâd like to see you crying

I wanna see you fall, I wanna hear you fall, I wanna make you fall
