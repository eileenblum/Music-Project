Awakened to heavy silence, no sunrise in sight
Was that just one more dream that passed me by?
Smiling as it waved goodbye "you know how nothing can last"
Still we crave for brighter days though we still feel blind

Seems no-one warned us when somehow we'd lose our will
The joys of yesterday still seem a perennial breeze
But could we carry tomorrow's burdens with dignity?
Today, the boundless reach of doubt should set us free

As pilgrims bound to will, our doubt must set us free

Like every fallen star
Must wake just once more
To arise and shine
As it lits the way for the lost

Puppeteered by fate
Or free to our paths
We'll stand and run again
For the ever elusive light.
