Right before there's light
Right before, this night
Right before the dice
We'll rise aloft Earth's heights
For five minutes we'll just lie
Give minutes, close our eyes
Five minutes, like a child
For just five, I'll hum a lullaby to you
Then we'll glide as sounds, you and I
Just this once, before the light goes out on us
