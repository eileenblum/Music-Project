You are on your own in your little world
And you drift away far away from here

On which cloud can I find you?
You have left this life behind
You met Jesus under the streetlight
I hope you found what you were looking for

I want you to be here, just be here

You have a look on your face
As if you donât know I exist
I disappeared from your radar
And what you are thinking about, I can only guess

Laying flat on your back
You remain lost
In this endless dream
Will you ever wake up to be with me?

Why arenât you here, just be here
