We, the dead, can not understand
Why these mortals don't envy us
In silence and peace we rest, but we don't exist

We have so many things in common
Why are they afraid of us? We can't understand
Our lives are over, theirs have no meaning
What have they got that we don't have?

Beautiful is our realm
Our kingdom no one can resist
In solitude's eternal bliss
Together we shall not exist
