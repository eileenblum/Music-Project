Don't mourn now
for your lost life
and what did you do to deserve it?
it was just a bitter gift

Pull yourself together
and with your last strength
make a final prayer
thank for the precious present...
death

The emptiness
consumed your weary soul
ate you from inside
like a parasite
But death came
-like a prince on his white horse-
and set you free with a last, sweet kiss

Don't dwell now
like a ghost
around your dead body
flee into infinity

My God-forgotten love,
finally we'll meet again
when our both souls
dissolve into infinity...
death awaits

No time to dwell in limbo...
shadows are here to get you
how they want to embrace you in their cold arms
and drawn you in the pool of tears
of those who suffered because of your sins

Follow the right path
which leads to the astral constellation
where your soul enters the gate
before the light dies away
Save yourself from them
the creatures without a shape
have followed you in your last trip

You are safe again
you entered the portal
their black arms couldn't get you

Wait for me there
as you sit motionless
with you arms around your knees
you are free now
