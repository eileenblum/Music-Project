It's time to move on
Time to leave my shelter
And step into this world
I had turned my back to

Time to find some joy
Time to share some happiness
My God, I forgot how to love and hate

Is this the world?
Is this my new shelter?
How could I base my hope on this?
Where can I find
Some light into this darkness
How can I build the fortress of truth
On a foundation of lies?

It's time to say goodbye
Time to move back into the shelter
I created for my own good

Time to cover my eyes
Not to see the faces
That betray their cold indifference

But I shall return to burn their houses down
-the houses built on lies and apathy-
To claim back my place I have never found
To break the silence
With a cry of desperation
