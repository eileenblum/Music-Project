To greedily reach out my hands
To touch the bare skin of this world
To thoughtlessly consume its tender flesh
To violate its insides without mercy

To greedily breathe the fresh air
To allow it in my hungry lungs
And spit it out transformed into poison
To infect the world with my pathetic existence
That's my only reason of being
