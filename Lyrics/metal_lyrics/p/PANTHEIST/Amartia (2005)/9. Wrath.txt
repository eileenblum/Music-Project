Devoid of all happiness
Condemned to eternal solitude
Not worthy to deserve
My Almighty Father's love

I was born with a sinner's heart
Although to Your laws, I did obey
My mind and body only throve
When I was immersed in sin

Rejected by my only Lord
Dishevelled by loneliness
Alone and aimless I moan
Outside Eden's gates

Suddenly from the shadows I'll emerge
I'll sink my rusted knife in His cold heart
The bastard God Who gave me life
Shall die now from my hands

On Your grace I kneel my Father,
And I ask you for forgiveness
Forgive me that I never could
Become what You wanted me to be
All my life I strove to be one of
Your very dearest children
Until I realized that Your endless love
Was not enough to include me
