I'm hungry for life
For pleasures to come, years to fly
Still more and more and more
I'm thirsty for loneliness
The key to my happiness
When I dive into my own world
I'm the whole universe

The solitary life I adore
It boasts my confidence
Laying at the shores of solitude
I'm the world itself

But if I'm the world
And the world is God
Where shall I find my creator?
If He made me so hungry for power over the world
Then who shall teach me to be humble?
