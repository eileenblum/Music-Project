Ancient goddess, deity of forgiveness
Please, hear my prayer
Allow me to cleanse my sins
In the pure waters of your sacred river

A death in each second
A slow death in every moment

Everlasting mother!
O mighty shapestress of my soul
Save my restless spirit
From eternal damnation

My eyes I cannot close
I might die in my sleep
My god, I cannot feel...
This emptiness inside
My cruel conscience is killing me
