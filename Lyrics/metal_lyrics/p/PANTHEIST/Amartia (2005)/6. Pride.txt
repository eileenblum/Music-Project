I'm proud of myself. Honestly,
I don't need anyone to tell me what to do
I have eyes to see the beauty of the world
Ears to listen to the music of the spheres
Hands to greedily grab what I want
Feet to take me to my self imposed destiny

O my Lord, please tell me
Why then do I need You
To comfort me, to caress me, to care for me
To tell me what to do
In this immense, confusing world?
