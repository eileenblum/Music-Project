Everybody is dead, nobody lives with me, nobody is here to help me
I'm quiet alone at present...
Is there a meaning in my life, my stupid life now!
There is one joy left to me: to wait for my death!
It's so painful! I'm pained to realize my solitude on the Earth. It's dark...
Why? Why does it happen to me?
I am in pain, my heart is heavy, I am in fire
I feel bad, my mind has killed, it is despair...
I miss my relations!
Only You, oh, my God, remain with me
You alone are immortal and invariable
Only You, oh, my God, remain with me
You alone give me support and consolation!
No one remains
Nothing is the real
Nothing is eternal under the Moon
Nobody has remained
Nothing is the real
Nothing is eternal under the Moon
Such is the Law, such is the cruel Law of Doom
Humanism is a strange for Truth!
I'm quiet alone at present, nobody has remained,
Where did they depart? I don't know!
Soon I too shall need to gather for the road
Hello, You there, my black destroyer, my wooden coat
It's good, let us bury me!
