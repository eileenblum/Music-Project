I could see Your Light once upon a time
And looked at the Sun till the darkness had blinded me.
Light lost!
I said to satan: Be master of my soul
And sin penetrate into me
Woe to me!
"Everyone who keeps on sinning is a slave to sin"
We are all rovers of sin!
Serpent creeps and creeps into my essence
Ancient serpent reign over the world
Serpent seduces and curses me!
Serpent vomiting his poison out
"Sin gives death, it is sting"
O, my God! What the matter with me! What must I do, help me!
So I'm entreating You, save me!
I'm quiet black for my sins those cry up to the Heaven
We are all rovers of sin...
O dreadful state!
My many sins, My foolish dreames before the death make Emptiness!
Woe to me! Quiet so, I feel the cruel fate that I have made...
As stupid sow that has been washed goes back
to roll around in the mud as I've done!
The lust of the flesh leads me downto the bottom of hell by satanic spell!
Hot burning abyss for a long time wait for me
My mortal perishable body I shall leave
A killer and adulterous man
I'll depart who has devoted to the lust and flesh one's heart!
This heart poisoned by lust!
My conscience cry accusing me of the crimes!
I've follen down and pray to You my God: Listen to me...
