The time's flow is inevitable
The vainities devour our power
Why do we rush about the Earth
Possessed by vain Hopes of changes
Death is inevitable
Fate is invariable
As ever!
It's boring to have, to have
No changes
As ever! Forever!
The time's flow is inevitable
I cannot pause myself
What am I doing? Why?
Which are my aims? Which are my ends?!
I cannot get rid of the loathome fuss
Of this world burdened of the flesh
And I'm doing something again'n again
Knowing no rest! Knowing no rest!
Vainity is our torture, suffer the Pain
The flesh opresses me from day to day
The vainity is our malediction!
Why do we bugger about? Bugger the fuss!
I fuck such a life. I'm bored to death.
Yes! Only Death'll dispel my boredom.
Apparently, I must commit suicide
That it should defeat the hateful monotony
Of my own days!
Apparently, I must commit suicide
