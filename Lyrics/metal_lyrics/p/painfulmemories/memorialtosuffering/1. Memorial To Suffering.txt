This Pain remainds of Doom
The roaming is aimless
Beeng uncertain is accompanied
By loss of a vital power
So We make them
So We make the monsters
Who are the results of our
Morbid imaginations
The fear, The fear
Increases and gets stronger
The fear, The fear
It's fragile existence
I've lost my Faith
Going on my way
How stupid-it all is a deception...
We immortalize a Human Suffering, Suffering
By our Deaths
You suffer! Suffering!
You suffer! Suffering!
The Pain prevents from a fascination
Pain...
