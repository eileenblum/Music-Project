The Bruts who have taken from their own lifes the enjoyment
Are disposing of other lives now! Yes, they do it. It's a pity
They are merciless killers comiting deadly sins
They give terrible death to their own children
Doom to Torment and Sorrow theirs and themselves too!
It's a weeping, here is a graveyard!
The children who haven't been born die in pain
This is a predestination
But Grief will come to the killers!
The babies were so clean, so clear and sinless
They were taken to Heaven, to God
Now they are praying for us, praying for us:
Forgive them, Lord Jesus Christ!
Your own grim parents killed You
Why is it?
Maybe, You hindered to live them
Is that so?
Did You hinder them? No, You didn't...
Just quietly sleep at Home, at Paradise...
