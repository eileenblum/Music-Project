I'm bigger than the God that you all believe. Step down off the throne
'Cause I'm taking over, devour the souls for those with no control
Impossible words used only by the fucking weak

I Am The King. You Will Look Up To Me.
I Am The King. You Will Bow Down To Me.

Blood coated concrete fists is what I will show
Now get down on your knees and bow down to me
I Am War. I Am Power. I Am Salvation.
If you bite the hand that feeds you all will fucking pay...
You will fucking pay.

Die... immortal with every bite
Immune with poison creeping in my veins

I Am The King. You Will Look Up To Me.
I Am The King. You Will Bow Down To Me.
I Am The King. You Will Look Up To Me.
I Am... I Am The King.
You Will You Will Bow Down To Me.
I Am The King Bow Down To Me.
