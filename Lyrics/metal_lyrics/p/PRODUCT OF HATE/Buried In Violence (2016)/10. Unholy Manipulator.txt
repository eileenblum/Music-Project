The lies and deception carries you
By the dreams you shatter you'll burn alive
Your life is fucking fake
Your life is what we'll take
You can never run you
You will never hide

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Fuck you your life will rust

The ties and redemption fade away
The shadows will soon unwind
Your life is fucking fake
Your life is what we'll take
You can never run
You will never hide

You will burn. You will burn. You will burn.
Burn alive. Burn alive. Burn alive.

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Fuck you your life will rust

Your life is fucking fake
Your life is what we'll take
You can never run
You will never hide
