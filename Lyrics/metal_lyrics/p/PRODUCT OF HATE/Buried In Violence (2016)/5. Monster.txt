My hate cannot be measured
No inches or yards
My thoughts are fucking vicious
My intentions are malicious
I dream of taking your last breath
Beating and cutting you to death
Revenge tastes so sweet
Like the pussy you once ate

Here comes the nightmare
Here comes the monster...

I feel alive a monster inside
I feel alive watching you die

This is the call for a war
Someone I deplore
I'll smother your attributes
Left in a hell of solitude
I have a righteous vendetta
The price to pay has just begun
You reap what you sow
I'll crush all your bones.
