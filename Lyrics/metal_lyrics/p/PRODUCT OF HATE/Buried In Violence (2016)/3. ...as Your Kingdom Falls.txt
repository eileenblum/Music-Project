You think that you know me
You know nothing
Judgmental envy
You try and tear me down
To the ground
A jealous sight

I laugh at your misfortune
I grin at my salvation

This is the end for you and me
As I watch you burn to the ground
This is the end for you and me
As I watch your kingdom fall

Your are a worthless coward
Crumbling tower
I will devour
So just accept defeat
Get down on your knees
And bag for mercy

I laugh at your misfortune
I grin at my salvation

This is the end for you and me
As I watch you burn to the ground
This is the end for you and me
As I watch your kingdom fall

Your kingdom fall
Your kingdom fall
Your kingdom fall to the ground

You know we both saw this coming from a mile away...
But you were just too proud to accept it...
You have no one left to hate but yourself

This is the end for you and me
As I watch you burn to the ground
This is the end for you and me
As I watch your kingdom fall

Your kingdom fall straight to the ground
