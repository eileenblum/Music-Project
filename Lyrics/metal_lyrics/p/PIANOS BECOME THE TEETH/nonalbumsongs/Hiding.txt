Thereâs no good in your eyes anymore
And it makes you want to drive home, drunk and alone
Curse the faces in the wheat
Drown yourself in the gold because you canât let it go
Makes you almost miss the smell of smoke in your clothes
And it makes you want to wear the wool
Itâs that need like nothing else
You bullshit with the best and wait for whatâs perfect
You bitch and moan more than most about
Where you think your life will take you
But you know thatâs no sort of pretending
I guess itâs the things that I donât say,
Weâre just pretending
Thereâs no good in your eyes anymore
Nothing is worse than doing nothing,
And I know, well, whoâs hiding it?
Who the hell is hiding it?
But you canât stay angry forever,
And I know, but you canât stay angry forever, or so Iâm told.
But the house gets so quiet
Sitting here wishing for just an hour or two, alone with you
Well, itâs always too personal,
Always too close to comment
They all mention how tired you look
And you realize you havenât said a word in hours
Well, whoâs hiding it?
Who the hell is hiding it?
I guess itâs the things that I donât say.
