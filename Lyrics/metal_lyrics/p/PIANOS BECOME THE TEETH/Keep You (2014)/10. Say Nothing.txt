So let's say nothing some more,
because this is something more than me,
and I got what I need,
but sleeping,
when I should've been alive,
it still gives me sand,
but clouds my eyes,
I thought about the rust,
the quote on the ledge about living on,
"that great consciousness of life,"
oh, what we frame and hang to get by,
whatever keeps your heart light,
whatever keeps you is all right by me,
but maybe I don't want to talk about how this life layed me down,
or how I saw the change because I didn't see you everyday,
unspoken looks and what the leaving took,
a lack of noise isn't a lack of life,
and that's the way I think it's always been
because, "I say it all, when I say nothing at all,"
so let's say nothing some more,
and let the words burn their way across the floor
because if these walls could talk,
I still couldn't get over a God damned soul,
and I can't hold smoke,
so let's say nothing some more,
because the sand stays with me,
because the sand keeps you.
