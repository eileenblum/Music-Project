If it's true, here's me telling you,
and here's me glad as hell that you'll never know,
and ever since I heard,
I've cursed her for putting that idea in my head,
I wear a stock smile so well,
"I'm doing just fine,"
but what'd you do to make it better?
I'm telling you, I've seen what it can do,
but what'd you do to make it better?
I wear a stock smile so well,
but who deals with anything like this well?
And if it's true, here's me telling you,
and here's me glad as hell that you'll never know,
and I think I lost my way, and either I stopped caring,
or I've been looking for it ever since and maybe those two go hand in hand,
and like you said,
"sometimes you just shouldn't know, shouldn't ask,"
I've been rushing through the world without a chance to really see,
and oh, I've been so touch and go,
I find myself moving my legs to make sure I still can,
and telling myself I don't have time,
I'll just wait and curse the day.
