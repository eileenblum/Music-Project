On the day you died,
I cut my hair for the funeral,
and on memorial day, I started drinking
because it got kind of hard just sitting there thinking
about mom all alone in that house,
and I'm too far away to do our lunch dates,
she misses the regimen
she misses the annoyances,
the free time is bittersweet.
