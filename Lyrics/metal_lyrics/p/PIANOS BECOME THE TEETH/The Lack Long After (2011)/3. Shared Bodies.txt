So striking, I swear you leveled me with a look,
reminded me of my breathing patterns,
ran your hands through the grease and set fire to my face,
seduced a love to grief and left the same as you came,
we were based on an end,
It's as if everyone always arrives already gone,
some say love is a river and the wetness behind my ears puts out the wick,
some say love is time, I helped you pass,
love is location, we were just circumstance,
could almost smell the must, the urgency
I knew better, I just didn't care,
but I think that I felt more inside you than I would have liked,
you carved me rigid, and I hate you for it
you were everything I wanted at night,
you were a dream, but come light,
I lost what I saw in you,
through those somber windows,
we were addicted to the moon light lines in my old room,
and I couldn't tell us apart.
