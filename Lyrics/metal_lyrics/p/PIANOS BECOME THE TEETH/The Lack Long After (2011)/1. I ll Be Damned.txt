Maybeâ¦ Maybe you saw your mother, maybe sheâs smiling, 
She hears your catching laughter, sheâs missed your charm, 
We never made it to Cooperstown 
But Iâve still got that glove under my bed, 
Maybe Iâll see you, we could shoot the shit, finally have a beer, 
âHave a catch,âbut for now its catch my tears, its catch my breath, 
I can just hear you say âcome on bud, get out of that funk, itâs time to move on,â 
Itâs funny how you still apply, you still know me, 
Iâll try to take your tools and make something worth while, 
Try to make ya proud, Iâve learned nothing is spotless anymore, 
But Iâll let you resonateâ¦ 

Maybe your Heaven is that Norman Rockwell scene 
Where you and your friends are singing that Gordon Lightfoot song, 
âIf you could only read my mind,â well if you could only read my mind, 
Well that ending, it was just too hard to take, 
Is it better than Clapton? Did you see your fathers eyes? 
I know itâs wishful thinking hoping this wonât always kill me, 
But If you saw yours, then Iâll see mine, 
You finally stretched your feet and ghosted away from me, 
You had to fade away, you had to leave 
Iâm pleading for one more time with what I know now, 
Iâm begging for the same flake to fall twice for the first time,  
Iâm begging for what wasnât said. 
That night the snow shaped the land, and I walked home, 
I laughed the whole way because I suppose if it hurts, 
It's worth it, but now that ghost is me.
