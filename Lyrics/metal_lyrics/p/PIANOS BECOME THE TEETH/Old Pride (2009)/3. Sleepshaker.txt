Oh hey, how was your day?
I wonder if it will speak through your smile, with an alike jaw, 
Wonder if they will have the same fire for fauna
I have questions hogging my bed, I'm heeding the easy sleeper, 
The joy bringer in you, the Unclouded
Highlights of life, my muscle memory
I'll hold the hair from the bones that hold your collar when everything burns,
I'll be your patience, I'll put in time
I'm afraid I'm afraid abalones don't know any better
I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm always wide of the settle mark
Don't spare, don't spare, our stories can't compare, don't leave out the details
I have more blood, but you beat faster, the encouragement
We've been through life and we are just learning each others names,
Just learning as we go
