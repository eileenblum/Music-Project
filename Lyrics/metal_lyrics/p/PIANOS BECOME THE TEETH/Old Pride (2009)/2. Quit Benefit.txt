You can't see but you're the best at hearing the friends we could be 
Insipid but still charming the hair off of our tongues, 
Singing of dying early just to be loved
I'm ignoring grasp
Decorating your walls with our senses, 
I'll tease you with a breeze in the heat
Do your bottoms touch your tops?
You are a parrot to what you hear
You are a parrot to what you've heard
Do the levels talk about you?
You can't see but you're the best at hearing the friends we could be
"You had this sadness and the pain, it made you attractive"
Oh oh oh well trucks, they know the water they throw so well, so at sea
Saved faces are still faces
What we knew we didn't say, what we didn't, we mouthed
We are not just as good as our words, we are not just elevator talk
