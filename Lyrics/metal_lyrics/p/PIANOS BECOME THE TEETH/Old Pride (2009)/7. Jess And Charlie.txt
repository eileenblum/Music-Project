Give her back and give him back to her
Her Charlie stayed fenced in on underwood road, she grew old and
She forever took off her riding boots
You've been handed a year
Don't let yourself forget you know the right way
Don't leave those dirt trails dead
Always heard the roar for miles, ears were always burning
Don't listen to what the holders told you
Don't look to what the old will writers left you
I'm proud of you now, I've missed you for years 
Seems like it's just holidays,
We chase yellows you and I, we chase yellows you and I
Shortest sleep, longest dreams of downing beating hearts
Don't walk, just roll down the aisles
Don't contort to the shape of easy, don't settle for just better or worse
Don't set in your ways,  
You know you can lean into me, you can lean into me, 
Bluest gills, grayest eyes, lean into me
