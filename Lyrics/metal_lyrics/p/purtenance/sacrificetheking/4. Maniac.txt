Sunny sunday afternoon,
no clouds in the sky,
Flowersbloom on the field,
Birds singing nicely
No worries, no fear,
good things only here
Suddenly a man appears,
Blood and guts in his hands
Waving them up and down,
laughing like a maniac
Took them from a women with a rusty knife
Without any remorse in hissoul
Cursed by a demon, really evil
The curse is everlasting, no hope of salvation

Dark sunday evening,
black clouds covering sky
Flowersdead on the field,
birds have flewn away
Big worries, great fear,
bad things happening here
Blood and guts in his hands
Waving them up and down
Waving them up and down
and laughing like a maniac
All who witnessed the sight got really sick
Death and violence has spread to the land
Demons plot has worked, they are violent
Smiling really happily,
Day has come to an end
Storm is coming, storm is rising

Hope is gone, life is lost,
All hope is gone, all life is lost
