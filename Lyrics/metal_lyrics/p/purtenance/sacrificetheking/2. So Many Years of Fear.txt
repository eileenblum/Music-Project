So many years of fear, we don't take it no more
It's now time to fight, you and your god
We have lost everything, what we have ever build
You took all when you came and brought your god

There won't left Anything from you
You will slain if you stand in our way

Flames will purify the filth of you
Churches and steeples crumble down too

We will have our own landsback,
we can enjoy what we once had
We don't have to bow to you,
we will rise and break free
You tried to steal our souls,
but they wasn't yours to take
They are something
we control as is also our minds

We have sharpen our scythes and axes,
there won't be left anything from you,
Flames will purify the filth of you
Churches and steeples crumble down too
