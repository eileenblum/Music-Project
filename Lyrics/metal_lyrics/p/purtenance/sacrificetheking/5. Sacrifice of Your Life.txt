The end, end of your life
So many years, so many lies
Believe in me, your god is dead now
Open the door and see your fate

The face, face in the dark
Follow the death, you will find me
Feel the fire, you burn alive
Take my hand, I will take you deeper

The maze of pain
Touch of death, breathless
In despair, all must end
Joy must go away

You have sinned and now you must pay
Devastation of your life
You will pay the highest price
End of your life will be painful
separation of body and soul
devastation of your life
Death comes through a torture
End of your life will painful
Soul will be sent straight to hell
Devastation of your life
Mind still feels the pain
End of your life will be painful
Body is bleeding dry
Devastation of your life
Bones are crushed with a hammer
End of your life will painful
Soul is seeing all this
Devastation of your life
No help from your god
End of your life will painful
He has left his throne
Devastation of your life

When life starts to fade away,
Dark path begins to shape
Take your last breath, i will show your way
Path of sorrow, right before your eyes
Path of sorrow, time to pay from your life
Your soul will be torn apart, suffer you scum
There's no hope in here, just pain
Pain now feel you, suffer that is your share
Here you will spend rest of times, eternity

The end, end of your life
So many years, so many lies
Believe in me, your god is dead now
Open the door and see your fate

The face, face in the dark
Follow the death, you will find me
Feel the fire, you burn alive
Take my hand, I will take you deeper

The maze of pain
Touch of death, breathless
In despair, all must end
Joy must go away

You have sinned and now you must pay
Devastation of your life
You will pay the highest price
End of your life will be painful
separation of body and soul
devastation of your life
Death comes through a torture
End of your life will painful
Soul will be sent straight to hell
Devastation of your life
Mind still feels the pain
End of your life will be painful
Body is bleeding dry
Devastation of your life
Bones are crushed with a hammer
End of your life will painful
Soul is seeing all this
Devastation of your life
No help from your god
Devastation of your life
Devastation of your life
