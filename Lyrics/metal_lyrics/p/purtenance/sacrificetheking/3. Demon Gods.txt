Demon gods of hate and rage
Demon gods of chaos
Demon gods of terror and pain
Demon gods of sorrow

At the end of day, black skies start to rain
Gods of hate and rage start to spread pain

Demon gods of hate and rage
Demon gods of chaos
Demon gods of terror and pain
Demon gods of sorrow

Despair in the air, noises begin
Gods start to spread, spread pain

Demon gods of hate and rage
Demon gods of chaos
Demon gods of terror and pain
Demon gods of sorrow

Fear in the bones, the agony of soul
Moment of calm, before the storm
