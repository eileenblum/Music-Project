Black vision in human skull
Like old wind in ruins
Awakens aggression, rises
Storm - out of nowhere

Blood flows in veins before
Fulfillment of hate and revenge
What makes that happen
What is the power

Who has the right
Who cares destruction
Black vision in human skull

Evil lurks in the shadows
That reflects from us
Dark moment in life
Everyone meets rage (at least once)

No one can say
Where that came
What makes that happen
What is the power
