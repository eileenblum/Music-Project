Fear takes over my mind
I'm lonely sailor
In the middle of storming sky
Lonely and forsaken
In deep blue darkness

Fears are out of my mind
No one see is to darkness
People's darkest fears
Have been too long hungry

No one has feed them
With black evil thoughts

At last it is time
When horrors get through
And rip's beautiful thoughts into
Pieces and may rest satisfied
