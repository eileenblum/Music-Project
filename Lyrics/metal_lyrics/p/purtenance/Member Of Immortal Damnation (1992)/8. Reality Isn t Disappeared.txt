Mind that rises from ash
Thoughts about death
They shatter in to air and
Leave you suffering

Sin is the power that
Keeps you alive and
Controls you like Master

Vanishing flame inside you
Corrodes memories about good times
Now is only omens from emptiness
And pictures of slavery

Chaos is everywhere
Where ever you look
Stench that pours from your soul
Is almost touchable mass

Reality isn't disappeared
You only can't see it...
