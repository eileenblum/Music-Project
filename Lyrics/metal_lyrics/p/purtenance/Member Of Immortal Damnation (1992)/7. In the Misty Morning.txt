In the misty morning you decided to get up
For a walk to the shore of pond
Where spirits and corpses dance
And sun's eye opened
Its hand reach to shore

Night has left ladders for you
The ladders to your maze of consciousness
You climb up them silently
To the vestibule of insanity

Stone-statue show the way with a sword
Across the gray reek of dead bodies

Night has left ladders for you
The ladders to your maze of consciousness
You climb up them silently
To the vestibule of insanity

Stone-statue show the way with a sword
Across the gray reek of dead bodies

Beyond the completeness
Lurks evil
Human, death and dust
All shred my soul apart

Sun's eye closed
And coolness arrives to pond
Evening brings the ladders
Light a candle for your glory
