Lights eliminate our shadow
Removed them behind us
From the sea rises a demigod
Wanting slaves to die

Apathic simplicity sinks
Into the brake of our minds
Same brake is in our hands
In the corner of spherical room

No methods for a creation
Divinity has burnt with churches
From who has this road made for
And Devil hasn't essence or lock

Confession...
The blind won't say a word
Rebirth...
From the clay, gray misery

It's inside of us
Dark minded, red violence
Rebirth...
From the clay, gray misery
