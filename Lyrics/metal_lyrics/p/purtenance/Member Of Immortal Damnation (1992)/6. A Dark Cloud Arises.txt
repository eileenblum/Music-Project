World's one mind
The mind apart from thousands
The hunger of sorrow
And another's accident

A black thought soars
Slays futile joy
A dark cloud arises
And sinks you into blue smoke

Confusion
A despair...
As a shadow, dark island
And forest, it whispers
Be awake... death's a dream!

The child of the infinite frost
The frozen hands of the pine
Calls you to save
To its icy arms
