Mortal sinks into deep dream
Before the final moment of time
There will be no second time, no more
Second chance to live right

You won't wake anymore knowing future

You will not wait for paradise and you won't fear damnation
Thoughts is like distant wind which
Sinks down to valleys and stops existing

Your sight is fading and cold
Takes your body to its icy hold
Crey man steps by your side
It won't disappear by looking elsewhere
You have come to end of your way

Silent pull, asking look
We leave with silent road
Without looking back
No more memories
No more return
