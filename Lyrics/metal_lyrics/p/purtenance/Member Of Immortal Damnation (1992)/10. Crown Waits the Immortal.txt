Behind the gates of mind castle
After gloomy corridors of soul
There lies a pool for wise man
For ruler who's the one

The pool needs a sacrifice
It's filled by hundreds of serpents
Cold throne isn't from them who dies
Crown waits the immortal

White candles never pass out
Light for the one who'll ascend the throne
Copper halls pull like a magnet
Death awaits you, crawl nearer

Dive under surface of pool
And you'll be his, forever
