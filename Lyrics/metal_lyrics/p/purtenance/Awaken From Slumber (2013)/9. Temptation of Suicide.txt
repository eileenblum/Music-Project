Demons in your head. Walls are closing in
Desperate thoughts dominate. Medication compensates

Fear of death strangles you. Lock the outside world you have
âcos death creeps out there. Dominating your life

Needle hits your vein. Relief from your pain
End to the misery. Escape reality

It has been this way so long
You have lost the control of your life
It has been this way too long
You are down and too weak to rise

Demons in your head. Walls are closing in
Desperate thoughts dominate. Medication compensates

Fear of death strangles you. Lock the outside world you have
âcos death creeps out there. Dominating your life
