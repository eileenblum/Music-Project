No tomb, no grave, no cave is safe enough to keep concealed
What was hidden, will be revealed, secrets are meant to be found
Desire to know all, is a fault built in man and it canât be healed

Something so horrible that has to be buried so deep
Should be so terrible that no one would want to know
Hunch of mysteries exist, obsess the obsessed mind
Only cure is to find, what was hidden, with a reason

Somethingâs should be left alone
As our minds canât understand
What was hidden, will be revealed but should they have undiscovered
