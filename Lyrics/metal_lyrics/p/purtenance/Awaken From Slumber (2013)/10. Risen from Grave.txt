Blackened memories
From misty morning, dark clouds arose
Desire buried
Hidden away to grave, set to hibernate

Dug up after time, first try failed
Time to try something else, now itâs time to rise
Let the past be gone, learn what was done
Do it better this time, strike the skeptics down

Lay down, feel the fire. Burn in the flames
Stay out from light. Stay in darkness
Rise up from dust, stronger than before

Let your soul be black as it truly is

Laid down, felt fire. Burned in the flames
Stayed out from light, stayed in darkness
Rose up, from dust, stronger, than before

Our souls are black, as they are meant to be
