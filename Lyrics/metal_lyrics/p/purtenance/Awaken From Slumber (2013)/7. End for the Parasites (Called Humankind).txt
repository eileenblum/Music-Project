From the vortex of death, comes out the vomit of end
End for the sick world, infested by parasites
It has gone to the point, where there is no return

Gates of hell open, vacuum sucks life out
From the dying world, end of the fucking fucks
No remorse, no repent, will you now help
There is no heaven for you, hell is all there is

Feel the pain strike you, see the flesh tear off
Blood boils in your veins, bones crushing in your face
Eternal torment, swallowed by fires
Hell is for everyone, no matter what youâve done

Gates of hell open, vacuum sucks life out
From the dying world, end of the fucking fucks
No remorse, no repent, will you now help
There is no heaven for you, hell is all there is

As you have sucked live out, from the seas and the ground
Now you must pay the price, end for the sick world
End for the parasites, end for the humankind
