Field of terror filled with corpses. Corpses of ancient enemies
They have fought now for centuries. Field of terror filled with corpses

Smell of rotten flesh and blood. Fills the air with toxic fumes
Field is full of bones and skulls. Lost souls wander there forgotten

Blood and guts everywhere. Screams of the dying
Moaning of the wounded. Echoes in the air
Black clouds block the night. Sulfur rain burns the remains
Dark angels in the sky. Sing the song of the end

Brainwashed soldiers keep on marching
To the battle that will never end
Fathers and sons keep on fighting
In the battle that will never end

Blood and guts everywhere. Screams of the dying
Moaning of the wounded. Echoes in the air
Dark clouds block the light. Sulfur rain burns the remains
Black angels in the sky. Sing the song of the end
