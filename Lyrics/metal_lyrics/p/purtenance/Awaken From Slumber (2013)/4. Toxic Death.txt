Fifteen years drinking, poison every day
Enough to destroy, my own life away
Pouring toxic death, down the throat
Some point organs, begin to mourn

Fifteen years every day, taking toxic every way
Mind is begin to break, organs starting to fail

Blood boils in veins, internal damages are great
Waiting for death to take, life away and rest I may

I just chose to take, mu own life away
Drinking toxic every day, for fifteen years every day

Black birds are children of the night
I now fly with them to light
Gave up the fight to keep my life
Shouted against the wind, now silent in where I lay
