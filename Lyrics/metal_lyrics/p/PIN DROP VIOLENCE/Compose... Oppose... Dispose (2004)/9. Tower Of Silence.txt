You've gotta stand your ground!
Stand your ground!

Life - a two edged knife,
Bleeds the hand that feeds,
Then puts up a fight.
A streak of rage.
Will you survive?
In this pool -
This pool of blood and grime.
Sucked in and squashed,
Fermenting in time.
Ignore your sores and
Wash your flesh raw with cuts.
See the flaming eyes,
ReaFUCKIN'lize again.
You shall be back,
To get some more,
Stubborn like before.
Your anger will show!

You've gotta stand your ground!
Stand your ground!

Ignite the fuel and light
Up the faces of
Me and all involved,
Up in arms and mind -
The things that's gone to waste.
Just kept it in,
And put away
Like its always been.

Bleed!
Bleed the wound.
Bleed The wound inside!

Feed!
Feed the need.
Feed the need in me!

It's innate.
In you and me.
We've got the need.
To let the muthafuckas bleed!

You've gotta stand your ground!
Stand your fucking ground!

It's innate.
In you and me.
We've got the need.
To let the muthafuckas bleed!
