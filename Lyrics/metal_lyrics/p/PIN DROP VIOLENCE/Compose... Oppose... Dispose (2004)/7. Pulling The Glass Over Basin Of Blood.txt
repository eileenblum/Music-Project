Fly through the windscreen
The concrete it thirsts,
Your lungs are all devoid
When you hit the dirt.
Your insides are outside
Your head's up your ass,
And now you are crying and
Pulling out glass.

PULLING OUT GLASS!

Excessive blood loss has now
Taken your sight,
PULL OUT THE GLASS!
As you crawl so aimlessly
Into the night.
PULL OUT THE GLASS!
You think you're so cool but
You're just full of thrash,
PULL OUT THE GLASS!
And now you are trying to
Pull out the glass.
PULL OUT THE GLASS!

PULL OUT THE GLASS!

PULLING OUT GLASS OVER A BASIN OF BLOOD!

PULL OUT THE GLASS!

PULLING OUT GLASS OVER A BASIN OF BLOOD!
