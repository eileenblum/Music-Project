Bleed your enemy!
His hate you will see!
Take my misery!
My hate you will see!

Hate is in my head! HEAD
Wanna see you dead! DEAD
Gonna rip your skin! SKIN
Wanna see you dead! DEAD

Be gone from me you self - biased liars,
Bone headed, defaced liars,
You've taken a life that you'd never... JUDGE!

Enough of you - you dumb fuckin' losers,
All I heard from you is abuses,
Don't wanna spend the rest of my life with... THIS CURSE!

Yeah - now you want to fuck with me,
Can't win so all of you want to kill me,
I'll fight each one of my enemies... ALONE!

I - don't want to be a loser,
I'll just be a social 'abuser',
I'll vent out my fuckin' hatred... ON YOU!

Bleed your enemy!
His hate you will see!
Take my misery!
My hate you will see!

Hate is in my head!
Wanna see you dead!
Gonna rip your skin!
Wanna see you dead!

Burnin' skin peels on touch,
A touch not far away.
I breathe down your throbbin' neck,
And burn your life away!

AWAY!

Bleed your enemy!
His hate you will see!
Take my misery!
My hate you will see!

Hate is in my head!
Wanna see you dead!
Gonna rip your skin!
Wanna see you dead!

HATE IS IN MY HEAD!
