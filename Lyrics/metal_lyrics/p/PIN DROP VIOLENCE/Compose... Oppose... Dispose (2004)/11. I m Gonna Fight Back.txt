It's time to feed once more on me,
Creeping over all my body.
Ripping at flesh growing tender,
Scaling new heights without fear.
Pincers bring a new dimension,
All these aid my crucifixion.
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!
THEY ARE SO GODDAMN REVOLTING!

GET THEM OFF!
THEY ARE SO GODDAMN REVOLTING!

As I lie here all my bleeding,
Takes my life out. Takes my breathing.
Fingers seek out ways for freedom.
Eyes filled with mud I can't see 'em.
Pincers bring a new dimension,
All these aid my crucifixion.
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!
THEY ARE SO GODDAMN REVOLTING!

Darkness forces a surrender,
Million eyes watch me go under,
Everywhere I feel them breathing,
In the slimy earth they're breeding,
Choking me with all their venom,
Numerous - I just can't bear them,
Thrashing all sides I can't free me,
In my mouth and I'm still screaming!

IN MY MOUTH AND I'M STILL SCREAMING!!!!
