I wish,
My skin could get as tough as yours,
Brutalized by harsh words,
Every fucking day,
Like some stones hurled,
But, through a mouth though,
All these cold walls have made me crouch in shame...

You will reap what you will sow!
You will get what you deserve!

I hope,
My skin could get as cold as yours,
Scales to deflect your wails...
Desensitized by words that shape and manipulate your fate,
With all this,
Now I've begun to hate myself...

Cold walls imprison me in their shroud.
These are the words I can live without.
Cold walls have risen out of the ground.
Nothing but darkness in and around.

You will reap what you will sow!
You will get what you deserve!

I dream,
My blood could get as thick as yours,
Sanguine,
So viscous to the touch,
Living,
Pining to gain immortality,
It's hopeless, I'm all spent,
All this has made me want to die...

Cold walls imprison me in their shroud.
These are the words I can live without.
Cold walls have risen out of the ground.
Nothing but darkness in and around.

Ruminating on these words...
Repeated day after day...
I've become just another scapegoat.
Is this what I was fuckin' born for?

You will reap what you will sow!
You will get what you deserve!
