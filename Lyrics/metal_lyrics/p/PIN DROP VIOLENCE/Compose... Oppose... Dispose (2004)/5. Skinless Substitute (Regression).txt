My fists are scarred,
But my words are true!
Me - I'm skinless,
I'm trapped in you.
Let me escape!
From my flesh cage.
Regurgitated!
By my own rage.
I want to be,
Not myself.
A pointless ego,
Mashed in my head,
Hate veins implode!
Inclusive pain!
I want out.
Just evaporate!
I've seen the world with
False eyes through you.
And I can't feel;
What I can't do.
And I can't stand;
What I can't feel.
'Cause I'm inside;
And I'm not free........

Let me out!
Let me go!
I need to feel the things,
I want to know.
I am so cold
And I'm shivering.
Licking my wounds
Which are festering.
Spit me right out.
Onto the floor.
So I can face the things
I want to know.
I am choking
Internally!
Waiting. Seething;
Till I'll be free!

I've seen the world with
False eyes through you.
And I can't feel;
What I can't do.
And I can't stand;
What I can't feel.
'Cause I'm inside;
And I'm not free........

I bleed away.....
My veins decay.....
I CAN'T FEEL A THING!
I HAVE NO SKIN!

SKIN!

ME!

KILL!

ME!
