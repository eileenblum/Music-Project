FUCK THE GOVERNMENT!
They take away your right to live.
They take away your right to breathe.
They take away your right to see.
Don't you ever fuck with me!

NO!

They call themselves the goverment.
Motherfucked establishment.
They take away your right to live
Don't you ever fuck with me!
They take away your right to live.
They take away your right to breathe.
They take away your right to fuck
Don't you ever fuck with me!

NO!
HERE WE GO NOW!

Rubbing my skin until I'm sore.
I just can't stop this thirst for war.
In my own space where I belong,
I will just sit and sing this song.

So run away you coward fucks;
I think that now you're out of luck.
No longer do I need refuge.
Yeah! I resist! I refuse!

Give me back my right to live.
Give me back my right to breathe.
Give me back my right to see.
Don't you ever fuck with me!

They call themselves the goverment.
Motherfucked establishment.
Give me back my right to live
Give me back my right to be!

NO!
You ain't listening to what I have to say!
You never listen to me anyway!
