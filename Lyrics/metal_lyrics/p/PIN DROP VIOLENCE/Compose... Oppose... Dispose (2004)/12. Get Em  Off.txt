It's time to play my game.
Trust? It's russian roulette!
Let's do it all again once more,
It's not done till you hit the floor.
Loneliness - a 4 wheel drive.
Where you go it climbs.
Crawling all along your spine.
Let the fuel and blood combine!

COMBINE!!!!

Perfect defect!
I'm the one that you don't expect!
Perfect defect!
I'm the one that you won't accept!

I learn some from my friend.
I learn more from my foe.
I'm just a human being,
Being not what I seem.
I'm going to lose my grip!
This life's the final trip.
You can run but you cannot fly,
From pain - the inbuilt high!

HIGH!!!!

I've found God again!
I've found life!
I've found him again!
I've found Christ!

A man with one eye ain't blind,
He sees half the world's lies.
The world that's not good enough,
To bring back Jesus Christ!
