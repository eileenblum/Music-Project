I've reached a point where I don't care,
Life's so fucked it's so unfair,
You bitch about the way I live,
You will hate what I will give.
Hatred!
From me,
You'll get it - when you will push me.
Stand back!
From me,
Or your life will soon be a memory!

Complicated!
My life is - disipated!
I can't take - all this shit!
I can't bear what I put up with!
Oh Yeah!

NOW DON'T U WANT A PIECE OF ME!

Reached the point where I don't care.
It's so fucked.It's so unfair.
Now bitch about the way I live.
You'll hate what I will give.
I know the end is here.(3)
YOU WILL HATE WHAT I WILL GIVE!!!!

Well now. You see;
Your life is just a bad memory.
Well now. You see;
Your life is just a fucking memory!
