Skeleton God, the Necromancer
Saint of Killers clothed in darkness
Halo of shadows surrounds his face
The holder of keys to the nightside gates
Holy Reaper! Bearer of Scythe!
Your silvery blade cuts thorught the sky
A serpents son, born of rebellion
Child of Eve begotten with the Lord
Vampiric hunger inflames his wrath
The voiceless whispers calling him to slay Abel
He opens a path to the other side
through bleeding throat â the Liberation of man
Let the Harvest Begin!
As endless void that swallows the light
Into the world of graves we ride!
Weâre sailing as rebel souls
Into the kingdom of dried bones
Descending to core of Hell
To realm of Lord Niantiel
To deny life, make a pact with Death
All hail master of burial ground
Hail! Hail! King of Golgotha!
