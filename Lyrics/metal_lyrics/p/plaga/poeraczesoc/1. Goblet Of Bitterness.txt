May all who have eyes shall see its glory
and all who have ears shall hear its gospel
all who have tongues shall praise its glory
all shall feel its arrival in flames!

Filled with wine of infinite wrath
a perfect symbol of the obvious mind
a scepter of terror, consecrated and blessed
Goblet of Bitterness

Filled with wine of infinite wrath
yes, I am the darkness and the light within light
chaos manifested in countless ways
from the golden sarcophagus to cold black graves

Goblet of Bitterness

For its sweetest of poisons, that flows from within
from veins, that pump this necrotic liquid
a morbid Devil's gift, not for here nor beyond
invisible, silent

Goblet, Earth's both poison and cure
Goblet... goblet
