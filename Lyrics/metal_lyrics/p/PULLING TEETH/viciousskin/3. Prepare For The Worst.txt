It's my belief that these are the end of days, we've taken things too far we ignored the warning signs it's too late to turn back now prepare for the worst we take what we want and we never give back this won't last forever, nature will have her revenge prepare for the worst plague, famine, war, death we brought this on ourselves you can't run, you can't hide we brought this on ourselves
