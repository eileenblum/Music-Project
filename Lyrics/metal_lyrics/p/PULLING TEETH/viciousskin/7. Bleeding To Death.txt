They make their cuts so small, so small that we can't see these wounds, they may be small but still they make us bleed bleeding to death, as we slowly waste away we're bleeding to death, but no one cares anyway this loss of blood has made us weak, as we constantly mend wounds too distracted to fight the source, too confused to seek the truth bleeding to death, we are the sick, we are the lame we're bleeding to death, too weak to make a change we're zo caught up in our own lives that we can't see through all the lies if we don't learn to stay alert then we'll be left with only dirt we'll never see trough freedom's eyes and i can't live like that
