What fuels our apathy when we stand up for atrocity? We're lied to every day, is this just the game we play? lost all hope in those who lead, they can't provide us with what we need fall for the same tricks every time, just fall in line, just fall in line if we can't learn from our mistakes then we must lie in this bed we make some say the kids will lead the fight, but they;re not alright, we're not alright
