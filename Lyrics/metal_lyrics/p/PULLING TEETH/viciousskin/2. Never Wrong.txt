It's never your fault, you're never wrong you can't admit that you fucked up, always right, no room for wrong pass the buck every chance you get you're just too good to make a mistake it's never your fault, it's never your fault, you're never wrong drunk or dumb, it's no excuse, you're in control, it's all on you so tired of hearing how you're not to blame, you;ve got an excuse for everything just admit that you fucked up, you can't admit that you fucked up
