We're not living in reality we're acting like we'll never die but the knife's at our throats and it's just a matter of time EAT, SLEEP, WORK, DIE life's to short to watch it pass boxed up like a rat in a maze working 'til we die, no way out of these endless days EAT, SLEEP, WORK, DIE it's so easy to start feeling so trapped but these are prisons we have built ourselves realize that this is hell
