We are the walking dead, numb to the pain around us we shut down our senses and lock ourselves in cages we shut down to ignore the fact that life is most is pain too selfish to make a difference denial is easier than shame this will be our downfall, this apathy will kill us all within this ignorance and neglect the snakes and rats, they make their nests
