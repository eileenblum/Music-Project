You were created by man, but you've taken on a life of your own, egomaniacal, selfish fuck, neglecting your responsibilities millions rely on you, too weak to stand on their own but you're so caught up in the glitz en glam, you forgot what you were created for and i wish that i could open all their eyes make them see you're not worth dying for make them see that there's so much more i defy you, you'll never have control i deny you and your soul-controlling role and i'll breathe every breath as a free man and i'll curse your fucking name as often as I can
