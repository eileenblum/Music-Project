You bitch and you moan from your self-made throne the king of the wasteland, he feels so alone you make your threats and you talked so tough yet expected support when times got rough it;s a vicious skin that you wrap yourself in, but it conceals the fact that you're rotten inside scarred flesh to cover the mess, you've wasted your lifem now there's no turning back bitterness encrusts your heart, it only hurts when it beats slip away into hiding and spit hate from the dark scorched brain and diseased mouth a mountain of shit from which to shout but those down below, they dont want to hear how nothing ever changes year after year demand our respect but nothing to deserve it twist words into weapons leaving the swordsmiths deserted you've burned every bridge and sunk every ship you've been left with nothing so you curled up and quit good fucking riddance, stay gona this time
