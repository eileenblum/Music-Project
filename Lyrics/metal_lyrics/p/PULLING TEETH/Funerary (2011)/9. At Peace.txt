hey old man, are you better off now? the pain you endured, no god would allow you never let it show, so stubborn, so still a man of such virtue, no god could kill peace, in death find peace some kind of release in death find peace please, see me as i sleep visit me in my dreams so i may be at peace your faith gave you strength to not succumb to despair you always put others first amidst this nightmare itâs all over now, but i still canât believe no god would bestow such abhorrent disease peace, in death find peace some kind of release in death find peace please, see me as i sleep visit me in my dreams so i may be at peace never will i see your face and never will i touch your skin and never will i ever get to see you smile again never will i see your face and never will i touch your skin and never will i ever get to feel your warmth again never will i see your face and never will i touch your skin and never will i ever get to call and ask for help again never will i see your face and never will i touch your skin and never will i ever get to tell you that i love you again
