when weâve got more going out than we do coming in weâve got a real sustainability problem someone explain this to me cuz it doesnât make any sense weâre told that itâs ok to spend what we donât have itâs for the good of the economy debt-based economics, just fueling our greed confusing our wants and needs itâs in our best interest to invest in sickness itâs for the good of the society the rich get more and the poor go bust but in the almighty free market we trust is this really what we need? in a world where greed is king we live beyond our means we spend what we donât have to gain the upper hand amass a pile of shit and live a life of debt bound by what you owe, buried in a plastic tomb this canât last
