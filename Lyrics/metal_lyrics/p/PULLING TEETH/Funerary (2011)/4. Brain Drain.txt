i know why you made your choice but still i feel a bit betrayed self-imposed suburban exile, white flight for the modern day i hate to say it but you know itâs true this cityâs dying cuz of people like you you believed the myth, you bought the lies of greener grass and bluer skies you somehow think youâll keep him safe from drugs and guns in that place i hate to say it but you know itâs true this cityâs dying cuz of people like you the disease takes control as the body is bled dry the ones who can help it are running for their lives now from the distance of your new home just watch it die
