a pleasant surprise but still unexpected the decision is made not to reject it plans have to change but it seems for the better creating new thoughts on forever not an easy choice in a place like this where the industry is human misery no, why canât we see the coming end of civility? trying to survive in a world in crisis one on the edge of apocalypse is hard enough when youâre on your own searching for a place to call home but raising a child is a whole other beast when selfish depravity simply wonât cease with so few of us thinking to the road ahead is it better to let us die off instead? extinct
