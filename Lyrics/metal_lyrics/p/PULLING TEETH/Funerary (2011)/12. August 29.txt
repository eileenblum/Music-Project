if every day is a gift iâd like to give this one back the longest drive of my life julie in the passenger seat and barely a word said between us we were on our way to visit when the phone rang still over two hours away two hours that felt like so much more in virtual silence in times like this itâs a bit unnerving how often thoughts like, âmaybe they made a mistake and theyâll sort it out right away and call back to let me know all is wellâ, pass through your head you keep checking your phone for that missed call, but nothing we couldnât get there fast enough, yet there was a part of me that thought that if i didnât show up at all then it couldnât become real wonât you please let me give this one back, give this day back cuz i donât know if i can make good use of this gift youâve give me i walked in the door to sympathetic looks from family and friends but it was the faces if my mother, brother, and sister that came into focus immediately what was there to say? are there any words that would do this situation justice? âat least it was quick and painlessâ âit most likely happened in his sleep so he never knew it hit himâ âhe no longer has to deal with this terrible diseaseâ none better than silence i just commemorated my first Fatherâs Day without mine we have no traditions of remembrance on that day for those of ours who have passed my father loved his music and he will live on in mine wonât you please let me give this one back, give this day back cuz i donât know if i can make good use of this gift youâve give me just take it back, please take it back, i donât want this, please take it back if i have one responsibility now itâs to take the lessons iâve learned and pass them on to those who will listen in honor of his legacy always fight for what you believe is right no matter how many are telling you youâre wrong always honor the work of those that came before you and always cherish the family and the friendships that share your laughter in the good times and that provide support in the bad
