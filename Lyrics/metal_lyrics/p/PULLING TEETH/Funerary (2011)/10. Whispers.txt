on those nights when sleep just wonât come youâve exhausted every option, when itâs all been said and done you think about what comes next when peace finally knows your name the regrets that you may have, what youâd do all over again whispers from a far away place and youâre gone without a trace did you give all that you had to offer? did it kill you to watch others suffer? we will be remembered for the things that we shared while our empires of waste dissolve into the air whispers from a far away place and youâre gone without a trace voices that call you by your name lead to light on your final day do you plan to go an anonymous soul? destined to be forgotten in time the lackluster outcome of a life lacking goals or will you leave behind a grand legacy? a history worthy of timeâs memory?
