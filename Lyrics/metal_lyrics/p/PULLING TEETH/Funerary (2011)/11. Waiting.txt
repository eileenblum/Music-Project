a genius ploy to maintain control, reward so great youâd sell your soul two-thousand years and still you wait, the hook is set with the perfect bait like a carrot at the end of the stick, the promise of eternal salvation lead the way and they follow, forever waiting on the impending return still theyâre waiting, theyâre still waiting for his return how much waiting can you take before you learn? always waiting on the coming of the messiah heâs not coming, now be damned all crooks and liars the time has come, the chance was missed, humanity has been dismissed itâs up to us to save ourselves, no way but up cuz this is hell take control of your own life, stop waiting on manâs biggest lie no savior is coming for your soul, find faith in self because youâre on your own
