forever dissolve in my hands no breath left to breath i can no longer taste the sun only chemical burn cities choking out their citizens fumes spew from every crack we're forced to live like rats the need to feed the greed for every product a cloud of smoke black skies and blacker stars but still we want more cities choking out their citizens fumes spew from every crack we're forced to live like rats i can taste the rust as the infrastructure turns to dust dig the graves and etch the stones this way of life leaves us cold and alone
