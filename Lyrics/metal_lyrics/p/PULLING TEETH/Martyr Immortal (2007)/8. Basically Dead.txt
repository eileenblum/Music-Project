we're living in a fucked up place greed and deceit at every turn ignoring history's lessons so we never fucking learn doomed to repeat our mistakes we deserve every shot that we take shut your mouth and lock your doors live in fear like never before to live like this is no life at all why we stand for this i'll never know i won't be quiet, i won't sit still and i won't be a prisoner in my own home doomed to repeat our mistakes we deserve every shot that we take shut your mouth and lock your doors live in fear like never before why speak when we can sleep? why climb when the peak is cold? why act at all when it's so much easier to simply do what you're told is this existence? is this anything at all? is this existence? wake up!
