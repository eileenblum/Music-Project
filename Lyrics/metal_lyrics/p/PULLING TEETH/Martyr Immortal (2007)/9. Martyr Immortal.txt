it's time to evolve ideas the old ways no longer work economics, religion - social control the winds have changed but our course has not it's time for new destinations let's sail off into new days free of these ropes that hold us back let go of what keeps us sedate what keeps us from seeking the truth burdened by our quest for purpose we'll never revel in what we have as long as we keep living for what exists once we have died we're wasting it all let's evolve - break free from this burdon of afterlife
