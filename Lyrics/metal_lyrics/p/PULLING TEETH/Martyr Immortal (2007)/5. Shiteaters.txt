too fat to fuck or too slim to fight? they've got a pill that can get you right there's no such thing as instant success we're lost in a mess of diet excess a beauty pill, a miracle cure it's just what you've been looking for no effort required an answer for the uninspired billboards with seductive eyes magazines so full of lies how are we supposed to feel if we don't know this isn't real? so we starve ourselves, we waste away searching for the easy way but what we want does not exist and depression turns into slit wrists it's never ending quest you've gotta look your best no price is too much but it will never be enough
