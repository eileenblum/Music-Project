i pray for rains to come and wash you all away erase the stains from this place and put a smile on my face i don't need you, i don't need you i don't want you here there will be quiet after the storm when you're no longer in my way i never used to be like this but you've filled me with such hate i don't need you, i don't need you i don't want you here my tolerance for ignorance it lessons every day infatuation with regression
