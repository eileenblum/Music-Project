what are you so afraid of? i can't see your point of view tired of your lies, sick of your hate why can't i get through to you? can't you understand we all want the same things a chance to live our lives free to be who we are? can't you understand? what are you so afraid of? this makes no sense to me why you'd choose to be this way we all wanna live in peace so why are you so full of hate?
