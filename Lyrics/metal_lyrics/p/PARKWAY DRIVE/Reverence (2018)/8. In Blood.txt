And through it all, we wore the pain
We held our own
Through the darkest of our nights

It's written in my blood
It's carved into my soul

Through the darkest of our nights

Because if you couldn't stop us then
What hope do you have now
When you dragged us though the fire
Did you really think that we would burn

We're no saviors
We're no saints
We're no martyrs
And we don't need saving
I've come too far to turn back
I've seen too much to play dead
If this is all you got then take a deep breath in
As I drown you out

I'm on the edge, I'm leaning out
But I can't see the sorrow for the pain

It's written in my blood
It's carved into my soul

The sorrow and the pain

So, you think you know the story
Did you read it in the scars
Because when you threw us to the lions
Did you really think that we would run

We're no saviors
We're no saints
We're no martyrs
And we don't need saving
I've come too far to turn back
I've seen too much to play dead
If this is all you got then take a deep breath in

Don't mistake composure for weakness
Don't mistake my silence for respect
I'll burn your world to the ground then spit on the ashes

Scorched fucking earth

As I drown you out

I've come too far to turn back
I've seen too much to play dead
If this is all you got then take a deep breath in
