You answer to me

I am the thunder and the rain
The confusion and the pain
And when I leave I will wash your wounds clean
And leave them golden

I got the whole world swingin' from the end of my chain
And I'm calling
I got your life in my hands and every debt will be paid
And I'm calling

Between the spark and the ember
You are smoke threading the wind

In time
All will return to me
In time
All find an end
You answer to me

I am the fight and the fury
Gravity in all its glory
And when I come around I bring the hammer of god
Down upon you

I got the whole world swingin' from the end of my chain
And I'm calling
I got your life in my hands and every debt will be paid
And I'm calling

Between the spark and the ember
You are smoke threading the wind

In time
All will return to me
In time
All find an end
In time
All will return to me
In time
You'll find no other way
You answer to me

I am the end and the beginning

I am the end
And the beginning
I am forever
I am eternal
And nothing stands against me

You answer to me
