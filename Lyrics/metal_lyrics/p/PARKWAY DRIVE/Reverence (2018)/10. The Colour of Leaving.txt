You never know just what you've got
'Til it's slippin' through your fingers
Never know just what you've got
'Til it's gone with the wind
And you never miss your shadow
'Til there's no one left beside you
You never miss your shadow
'Til you're all alone in the dark

You never know just what will break you
'Til you're picking up the pieces
Never know just what will break you
'Til your world falls apart
Never know how small your voice is
'Til you're screaming out the silence
Never know how small your voice is
'Til you're arguing, arguing with God

I saw death's face today
As he led my friend away
I saw death's face today
As he cast his shadow over me
I saw death's face today
As he led my friend away
So I'll ask who I gotta pay
To bring him back
Bring him back to me
Bring him back to me

You never know the words you should've said
Until they're all that you left with
Until the dirt is falling and the guilt it burns your bones
And we ask the biggest question
Why the fuck did this all happen?
Who on Earth deserves this and what the hell do we do now?
So we live like we have lost
And we love like we are broken
And as the color leaves the sky we're left in reverence
Of the frailty of it all
