So it begins

Our eyes drawn open,
Free from the thoughts of doubt,
Free from our selfish confines.
Our blood, restless, ceaseless.
With open arms we stand
Before the dawn.

The sun seems to have been rising
Ever since I can recall
Leaving a sense of permanence
To this lying world.

Your words not worth the air,
Your life not worth its weight in flesh.
To hope for something more,
To dream of substance.

Like a million before us
Waiting to die.
Like a billion before us
Waiting to die.

Masochistic to think,
This would be remembered (would be remembered).
Sadistic, perpetuation
Of stagnation.

[2x]
There is nothing as empty
As waiting to die.
We've spent our lives
Wasting as time eats us alive.

The sun seems to have been falling
Ever since I can recall.
The only sense
Of permanence
In this dying world.

Sit back and watch
As time eats us alive.

Everyone who knew me,
Knew me.
Destined to die,
Die.

The marks I left upon this world
Will wash away
In time.

In time,
And so it ends.
In time
It all finds an end.

In time,
And so it ends.
In time
We all find an end.

With broken arms
And hollow eyes
I'll wait to return to oblivion.

Embrace our last
Empty horizon.
Embrace our last
Empty
Horizons.

Horizons.
Horizons.
Horizons.
