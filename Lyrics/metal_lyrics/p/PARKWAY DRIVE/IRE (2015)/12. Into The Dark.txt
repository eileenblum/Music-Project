[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]There was a time I felt invincible
In the cradle of youth I felt I owned the world
Until I held so tight I felt it slipping away
Into the dark I strayed
Into the dark, I stayed
I chose a broken road until life had left my soul
Into the dark I strayed
Into the dark, I stayed
Until you gave my life meaning

[Chorus:]
You are the blood in my heart
You give me something to fight for
You are the wind in my lungs
You are the blood in my heart
You give me something to fight for
You are the wind in my lungs
So I'll fight for this

There was a time I felt untouchable
But in shadow of pride is where the danger dwells
I flew so high my wings burned away
Into the dark I strayed
Into the dark, I stayed
I chose a broken road until the life had left my soul
Into the dark I strayed
Into the dark, I stayed
You gave me hope through your faith in me

[Chorus:]
You are the blood in my heart
You give me something to fight for
You are the wind in my lungs
You are the blood in my heart
You give me something to fight for
You are the wind in my lungs
So I'll fight for this

[Jeff Ling Solo]

[Chorus:]
You are the blood in my heart
You give me something to fight for
You are the wind in my lungs
You are the blood in my heart
You give me something to fight for
You are the wind in my lungs

You give me something to fight for
