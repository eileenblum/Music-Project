Iâve heard enough
No more, no more
Youâve had your time in the sun
Keep your head down kid, your fifteen seconds are done
I know it hurts, I wanted it this way
All these years, Iâm still the voice you canât destroy

I know how this one ends
Lying in the gutter spitting teeth at the sidewalk
I know how this one ends
So bite your tongue if you canât tame it

Letâs get this straight, while youâre listening
In my world you count for nothing

Bow. Youâll be the one to
Drown, with the rats and the snakes
Bow. Youâll be the one to drown

Bottom feeder
Bottom feeder
Bottom feeder
Bottom feeder

Iâve heard enough
Iâve heard enough to know
Who talks the talk, who walks the walk
And whoâs for fucking show
I know it hurts, I know it cuts
That Iâm still standing
Iâm everything youâre fucking not

I know how this one ends
Running from the world as your lies begin to cave
I know how this one ends
Your hollow words make shallow graves

Letâs get this straight, while youâre listening
In my world you count for nothing

Bow. Youâll be the one to
Drown, with the rats and the snakes
Bow. Youâll be the one to
Drown

Bottom feeder

Bow. Youâll be the one to
Drown, with the rats and the snakes
Bow. Youâll be the one to
Drown

Bottom feeder

See I feel no guilt, like I feel no pain
Like I feel the fire running through my veins
You canât draw blood when my heart beats cold
And Iâll take your word like I take your name
An ego lost in the valley of self disdain
Pride cometh before the fall
And youâll break as I watch it all collapse

No mercy, No peace. You canât escape this beast
No mercy, No peace. You canât escape this beast
No mercy, No peace. You canât escape this beast
No mercy, No peace. You canât escape now snap your neck to this

You snap your neck to this

No mercy, No peace. You fucking bottom feeder
No mercy, No peace. You fucking bottom feeder
Fuck!
