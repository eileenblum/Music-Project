[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Midnight approaches
Are you awake?
I heard the devil, he was calling your name
Your soul is empty
Your words are cheap
You're selling for war
While you're praying for peace

But I don't think you want it
I want you to see
The tide is turning while there's something to save
You can't see it
You keep talking
When you stand for nothing
You'll fall for anything

[Chorus:]
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
For all to see
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
The devil's calling

Midnight it finds you
Down on your knees
Pray forgiveness while
You're trading lives away
The truth was hijacked
Gone without a trace
When all is done
We won't forget your face

I can feel the fire
I can see the pain
We're tired of choking on your hypocrisy
You can't see it
It's not working
When you stand for nothing
You'll fall for anything

[Chorus:]
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
For all to see
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
The devil's calling

[Jeff Ling solo]

We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning

[Chorus:]
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
For all to see
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
The devil's calling
