Let me beat in your heart
Be your drum of war and love
Let me hide in your arms
Be my cage, my key, my lock

Let our bones collide
Until the light falls like anvils from our eyes
When our dreams ignite
Disappear in their fire

Be my deathless song
Fill my aching lungs

Breathe your life into me
Because I drown in your shadow
Like salt in the rain
If my fear is tomorrow
Your memoryâs the fight in my veins

Let me beat in your heart
Be your drum of war and love
Let me hide in your arms
Be my cage, my key, my lock

Let our bones collide
Until the light falls like anvils from our eyes
When our dreams ignite
Disappear in their fire

Be my open sky
Fill these wild eyes

Breathe your life into me
Because I drown in your shadow
Like salt in the rain
If my fear is tomorrow
Then your memoryâs the fight in my veins
