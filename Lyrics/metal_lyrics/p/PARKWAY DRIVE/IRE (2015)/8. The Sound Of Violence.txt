We cut our teeth on sadness
We hunt our sorrows down
We fought the nights so sleepless
We made our beds on the cold hard ground
Seasons come and go, traditions rise and fall
We watch with hunterâs eyes
We found the place to call our own

What we have, we hunt. What we kill, we keep
Shadows never die, darkness never breaks

You built your bastions of ivory and pride
We see your gates, but do not knock
We stay out in the wild

What we have, we hunt. What we kill, we keep
Shadows never die, darkness never breaks

This is the sound of violence
These are the songs of war
We are everything you fear
And weâre clawing at the walls

This is the sound of violence
These are the songs of war
We are everything you fear
And weâre clawing at the walls
Weâre clawing at the walls

I see a kingdom of closed minds and shallow hearts
So tell me this, would you fall in line
Or rip it all apart

What we have, we hunt
What we kill, we keep
Shadows never die
Darkness never breaks

This is the sound of violence
These are the songs of war
We are everything you fear
And weâre clawing at the walls

This is the sound of violence
These are the songs of war
We are everything you fear
And weâre clawing at the walls

This is the hour of the wolf
Weâre clawing at the walls
This is the hour of the wolf

This is the sound of violence
These are the songs of war
We are everything you fear
And weâre clawing at the walls

This is the sound of violence
These are the songs of war
We are everything you fear
