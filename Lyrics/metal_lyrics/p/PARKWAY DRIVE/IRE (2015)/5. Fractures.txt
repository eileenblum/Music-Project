The devilâs at our door

The Bloodwoods shiver in the glare of summers haze
Dust of ancient lands breathes beneath our feet
Since the dawn of time, giver of life divine
Shadowed by dark ruination, looming down the line

The poisoned lies of narrow minds
Now spread into the soul of life

Bitter blight fractures life
This call for change wonât be too late

The devilâs at our door
Selling foolâs gold and a miracle cure

Hearts of fire unite and man their barricades
Truth is overwhelming and yet
Hollow men still talk in vain
Sowing sickness, shifting focus away
Setting in stone a future we cannot sustain

We canât quench our thirst on profits gained
And we canât turn back once it begins

Bitter blight fractures life
This call for change wonât be too late

They poison the well and expect us to drink
When the river runs dry only then
Then will they see

You can line your pockets, but you canât buy back your soul
These gates are locked, this future is not yours to own

Bitter blight fractures life
This call for change wonât be too late
