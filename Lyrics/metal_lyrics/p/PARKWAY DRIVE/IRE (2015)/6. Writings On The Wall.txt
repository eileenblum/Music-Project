When youâre born in the dirt the only way to grow is up
So we reach for the sun but it seems
Every rung that you climb is another crooked line
That you cross off the tally of your dreams
Donât step out of line kid, you learn it pretty fast
Every face has its place in the crowd
Theyâll give you all the answers, so you donât ask any questions
Then theyâll march you with a smile into the ground

And we all go to heaven in a little row boat

So put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps wonât ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
The writingâs on the wall, this ainât ever gonna stop
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps wonât ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Weâll fight until we die, this ainât ever gonna stop

This stray dog world, this sick sad place
Got a belly full of maggots and disease
Every apple here is rotten, every blessing is a curse
Every word is a lie you best believe
We take one step forward, then two steps back
In a race to the bottom of the barrel
They teach us how to fear
They teach us how to hate
Then they arm us and they march us off to hell

And its left, left, left right left

So put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps wonât ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
The writingâs on the wall, this ainât ever gonna stop
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If crawling for the scraps wonât ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Weâll fight until we die, this ainât ever gonna stop

Because they came for our minds
We said nothing
They came for our hopes
We said nothing
They came for our souls
And still we said nothing
Now theyâre coming for our lives
So whatâs it gonna take

Whatâs it gonna take

See how they run, see how they run

So put your hands up, put your hands up
If clawing for the scraps wonât ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
The writingâs on the wall, this ainât ever gonna stop
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If clawing for the scraps wonât ever be enough
Put your hands up, put your hands up
