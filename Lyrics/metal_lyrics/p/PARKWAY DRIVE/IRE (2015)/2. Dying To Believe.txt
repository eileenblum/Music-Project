Like dragging nails through my skin

Strip the scar, scratch the itch
Dig your nails deep, until the nerve is good and raw
Pulling teeth again, to pay for all your sins
The blue pill or the red, all you want are enemies

Feel the tension set to break
Weâve swallowed more than we can take
Like dragging nails through my skin

Die, die, dying to believe
This beast you resurrected wonât break its leash
Weâre die, die, dying to believe
That the ghost of the ills of this world will
Find you where you sleep

Weâll find you where you sleep

God complex, letâs start a war
Whose prayers will you answer, whose will you ignore
Paint it black and torn apart
BaptizedÂ in hate to the beat of a hollow heart

Feel the tension set to break
Weâve swallowed more than we can take
Like dragging nails through my skin

Die, die, dying to believe
This beast you resurrected wonât break its leash
Weâre die, die, dying to believe
That the ghost of the ills of this world will
Find you where you sleep

Weâll find you where you sleep

Because itâs a sick fucking world in a sick fucking time
Splitting at the seams as you desecrate the hive
The cancerâs in your heart
The poisonâs in your mind
Forked tongue motherfucker tell me how the hell do you sleep at night

How do you sleep at night

Dying to believe

Die, die, dying to believe
This beast you resurrected wonât break its leash
Weâre die, die, dying to believe
That the ghost of the ills of this world will
Find you where you sleep
