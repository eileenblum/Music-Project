Brothers, my brothers
Is this all that we are?
Sisters, my sisters
We've been crushed by the fist of God

Welcome to the free world
Where nothing's as it seems
Tell me, can you find a cure?
When you can't see, you can't feel the disease
Can you seek a higher truth,
When you're living on your knees,
Where freedom grows from blood-soaked soil
In the land of hypocrisy?

'Cause if you can't see the chains, tell me what use is the key
It's cash, blood and oil in the age of the refugee
They try to buy our minds, we ain't selling
Bang, bang, bang, another nail in our coffins

Cut the strings 'til your heart stops
Cut the cord
Crack this code of silence, all our lives in the hands of tyrants

Crushed by the fist of God (crushed) [2x]
We've been crushed by the fist of God [2x]

To the left I see the rats and to the right I see the snakes
In my ear they're whispering sweet sermons of cruel hate
So, do you buy the fear or do you buy the lies?
Tell me what will set us free?
Do we kneel before the crooked few
Or do we bite the fucking hand that feeds?

When death casts no shadow and hope carries no weight
Rise into the light and feel the shackles fade away
They fear what we know, we know how they break
Bang, bang, bang, drop the hammer of conscience

Cut the strings 'til your heart stops
Cut the cord
Crack this code of silence, all our lives

Crushed by the fist of God (crushed) [2x]
We've been crushed by the fist of God [2x]

We're just waiting for the sky to fall
Yeah I'm just waiting
Feels like all our lives
We've been waiting for the sky to fall
Feels like all this time
We've been

Brothers, my brothers
Is this all that we are?
Sisters, my sisters
We've been crushed by the fist of God

Crushed by the fist of God (crushed) [2x]
