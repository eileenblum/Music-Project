Twelve years Iâve fought for this
Twelve years, my heart still beats
For the ones whoâve stood beside me
Still strong
You canât break me

Twelve years Iâve fought for this
Twelve years, my heart still beats
For the ones whoâve stood beside me
Through the values that define me
No compromise, no surrender
These beliefs, they make me whole
Never the breaker, promise keeper
Remains the ethic instilled in me

Never one to bite my tongue
Never turn, never run
Iâve seen with my own eyes
The price of life and the cost of lies

You canât shut this down
I still spit fire
This truth rings loud
You better listen up
You
Canât
You canât break me

Twelve years Iâve fought for this
Twelve years, blood sweat and tears
For my family here beside me
True to the ethos held inside me

Life pushes hard, you push back
Time makes its mark, you gotta stand the test
Every dog has its day
We make it count
We find our own way

You canât shut this down
I still spit fire
This truth rings loud
You better listen up
You
Canât
You canât break me

Twelve years Iâve fought for this
Twelve years, my heart still beats
For the ones whoâve stood beside me
Still strong motherfucker so step back

Through blood, sweat, tears
Weâre still here

Unbreakable
