But there is no silence.
My thoughts drowned out.
Screeching and grinding resonates through a hollow shell.
There is no great wisdom.
There are no answers.

I close my eyes, but all I see is red.
I bite my tongue, but all I taste is blood.
Once again they set their traps, set their hooks, deep in my head.
Too naive to think these forked tongues would themselves devour.

Show me war.
Show me pestilence.
Show me the blood red hands of retribution.

And the abyss stares back.
Leviathan I.

To break their hold, strip the flesh straight from their bones.

Cast their limbs into the gears of the beast.
Bring this monstrosity to its fucking knees.
Eye for an eye.

I'll send this world blind.
Show me war.
Show me pestilence.
Show me the blood red hands of retribution.

And the abyss stares back.
Leviathan I.

Under a blackened Sun.
Beneath a hunter's moon.
Seething.

Dogs of war, they call for blood but it will not be mine.
