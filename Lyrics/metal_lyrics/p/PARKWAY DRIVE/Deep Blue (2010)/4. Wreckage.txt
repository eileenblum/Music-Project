I am the blackest soul.
The child of a loveless world.
The wreckage left in the wake of time.
I am the consequence of complete collapse.
I am the horror you created.
The mind fuck you instigated.
I am the seed of self-destruction, the bitter taste of life's regret.
Flood my lungs.
Pull my teeth.
Cross my eyes until there's nothing left.
There's nothing left.
Casualties to the snares of modern life.
Anchored by avarice, there is no further left to sink.
I reside in my mind's eye, yet see no truth in a world of lies.
I reside in my mind's eye.
We are adrift in a world of lies.
Flood my lungs.
Pull my teeth.
Cross my eyes until there's nothing left.
I am the blackest soul.
The child of a loveless world.
I am the consequence of complete collapse.
I am the blackest soul.
