Their voices search for me through the darkness, yet I feel desire's cold grip upon my heart no more.
My solitude.
My shield.
My armour.
Tested with full force.
I have seen the face of death and I choose not to accept its form.
I have seen the face of death.
An army of demons summoned forth, upon this endless night they swam.
The fire in their eyes, like new Suns shire through the abyss.
I taste the fear.
I see the weakness in their eyes.
They cannot hide as I devour all.
As the mountains crack and the oceans boil, a fury-tempered heart is forged.
Within the flames, this current of corruption will cease.
I taste the fear.
I see the weakness in their eyes.
They cannot hide as I devour all.
An army of demons summoned forth.
Upon this endless night they swarm.
The fire in their eyes, like new Suns shine trough the abyss.
I have seen the face of death.
I have seen the face of death and I choose not to accept its form.
My solitude.
My shield.
My armour.
Tested with full force.
Their voices search for me through the darkness, yet I feel desire's cold grip upon my heart no more.
