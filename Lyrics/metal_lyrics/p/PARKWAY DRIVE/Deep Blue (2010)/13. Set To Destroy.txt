Brothers of abandonment, sisters of despair.
Orphans to the watching ones above.
Too far removed, too far to care.
We are the unwanted.
We are the one true threat.
We raise our hands to this World's throat choke away its dying breath.
This is the end of days, this is the end of days, this is the end of days.
Set to destroy.
Fathers to our faithless days, mothers to our twisted ways.
Bow your heads.
Fold your hands and pray.
Your time has come.
This is the end of days, this is the end of days, this is the end of days.
Set to destroy.
Your flame is faded, so sink below.
Rest now your heavy head upon
your bed of bones.
Too far removed.
Too far to care.
Set to destroy.
