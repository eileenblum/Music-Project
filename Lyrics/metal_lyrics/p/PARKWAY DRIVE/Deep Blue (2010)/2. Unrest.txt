I've walked these streets a thousand times, still this world never seemed colder.
Compromised a thousand times to the will of malicious minds.
Reality never hit so fucking hard.
Crushed by endless desperation, endless surrender.
Retrace the steps, retrace the steps.
Is this what I have become?
Retrace the steps, retrace the steps.
What the fuck have I become?
Security, illusion for the weak.
Refuge, sought in routine.
Another gear in their fucking machine.
See, you can win the rat race but you're still nothing but a fucking rat.
So seek that crown, because in this kingdom of fools true ignorance reigns supreme.
I see this city for what it is.
Retrace the steps, retrace the steps.
A monument to the depths of human misery.
Retrace the steps [6x]
What have we become?
