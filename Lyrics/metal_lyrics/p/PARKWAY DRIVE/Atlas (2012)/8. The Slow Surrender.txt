You've got to fight for your life
There is nothing to fear but fear itself
The Devil dances in idle minds
Fight for your life
I won't turn back now
This will be no slow surrender
I won't turn back now
Carpe Diem, straight for the throat
Conflict, the all-consuming pain
Time lost will never be regained
Don't waste your breath
You can't save your strength
The battle rages in the here and now
See every second that you waste
Is time you'll never live again
Fight for your life
Fight for your fucking life
There is a price to pay
Death is a heartbeat away
The Devil dances in idle minds
Fight for your life
I won't turn back now
This will be no slow surrender
I won't turn back now
Carpe Diem, I gotta go straight for the throat
The Devil dances in idle minds
