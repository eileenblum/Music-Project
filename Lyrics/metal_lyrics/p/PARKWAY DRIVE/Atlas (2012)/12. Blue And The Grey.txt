Dear sky,
Dear sky don't cry for me,
(cry for me)
Be the hope I could never reach
Cold sea,
Please don't let me sink,
(don't let me sink)
Wrap your arms around me and carry me home

I stood at the shore and spoke to the ocean
I stood in the water and let my guts spill
I said "You and me, we're not so different,
I see my reflection in all that you do"

We both keep our secrets
We're both, oh so blue
My heart is full of darkness
I know that yours is too

I sat on the rooftop and screamed at the sky
I sat on the edge until I knew deep inside,
Like the sky, I will always be empty
The horizon, my love, forever just out of reach

We both keep our secrets
We're both, oh so blue
My heart is full of darkness
I know that yours is too

Distance was born when the sea and the sky grew apart
Loneliness was born the day I let you go

I let you go!

So now I stand at the shore and speak to the ocean
I stand in the water and let, let my guts spill
Let my guts spill

We both keep our secrets
We're both, oh so blue
My heart is full of darkness
I know, I know that yours is too

Dear sky,
Dear sky don't cry for me, be the hope I could never reach
Cold sea, please don't let me sink
Wrap your arms around me and carry me home

Dear Sky!
