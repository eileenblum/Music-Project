Forever fucked
We wage a war of suffering a deceit
100 thousand years of dreaming, drowned in a flood of fear and greed
Precious heritage laid waste before the chainsaws snarling teeth
Bleed the earth, bleed her 'til her heart no longer beats

And still we wonder why
As the ground beneath our feet turns to dust
The air we breathe, laced with poisons
A legacy of disgust
A legacy of sorrow
So we're born with nothing and we die alone

We're born with nothing
And we die alone
Regret is all we have
Death is all we know
[2x]

Forever fucked
Eradicate the truths of history
Train our eyes, train our minds so we no longer see the casualties
Countless cultures murdered, generations stolen and deceived
No guilt to bear
Born to consume, to breed, to deny all that makes us free

We're born with nothing and we die alone

We're born with nothing and we die alone
We're born with nothing
We die alone
[2x]

We die alone

Forever fucked
We're born with nothing and we die alone
We're born with nothing
We die alone
