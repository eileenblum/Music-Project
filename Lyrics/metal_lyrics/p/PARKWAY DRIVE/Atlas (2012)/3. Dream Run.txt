Do you remember all those nights
That we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young, we still have time
In my dreams I see it ending
I see, I see the sky descending
And I'll let the seconds
Rip in to my heart
Cause in my dreams i fear of falling
When I hear the darkness calling
Dont wake me up until the morning's night
Cause ive never felt more alive.
Do you remember all those nights
That we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young.
Well I never, never, never wanna press rewind
Every mistake that lead us here I wouldn't change for anything
I wouldn't change for anything.
Stand up
There is a wall that stands between us and them?
See this was never about giving up, just giving in
Because you only live once
But you spend your whole life dying
So when it all comes crashing, know you're not alone
You only live once
But you spend your whole life dying
So when it all comes crashing, know you're not alone
Alone!
Alone!
Alone!
There is no death with all our sins
There is no fear when this life ends
There is no fear
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember all those nights
That we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young, we still have time
Do you remember all those nights
That we stood side by side
And we said we'll save the goodbyes
The night is young, we still have time
Cause i've never felt more alive
I've felt more alive
Alive!
Alive!
Alive!
