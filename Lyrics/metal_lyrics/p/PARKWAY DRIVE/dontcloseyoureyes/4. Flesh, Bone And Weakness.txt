Shades drawn across
No light may enter
In my moment of weakness
And this world is bearing down again
So hard to clear my mind
Why do i persist?
I'll endure another day
It's just so hard to resist
And I can't continue on
So hard to clear my mind
To see the thoughts I wish were true
My face versus the stone
And I blame myself
Plague my mind with these insecure thoughts
Whispers in the back of my head
Telling me it's all wrong
Why do I persist?
I'll endure another day
Why do I persist?
As self loathing strangles me
Push past the veil of helplessness
Love can't catch me, not today
Take your hand and just surrender?
It's just not worth it
Why do I persist?
I'll endure another day
Why do I persist?
Self loathing strangles me
But I'll endure another day
