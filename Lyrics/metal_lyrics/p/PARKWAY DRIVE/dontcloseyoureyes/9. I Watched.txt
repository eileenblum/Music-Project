[Re-release 2006 bonus track]

In an instant this world's hate engulfed all tenfold
Hate
I watched the birth of tomorrow's catchphrase
Terror
As the sky came crashing down
True terror now assumes a human form
Suspicious minds and pointing fingers still ignore
Suspicious minds tear at innocence
I watched the sky burn
As the ashes fell
Time stood still
