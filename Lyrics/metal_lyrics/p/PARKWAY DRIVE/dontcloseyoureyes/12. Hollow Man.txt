[Re-release 2006 bonus track]

Lie
No more than shadows
To be forgotten
Fade away in time
No more than shadow's their dreams will never come to pass
Trapped by your web of ignorance
Trapped by your web
Your web of lies
Too much pain
Too much anguish already endured
More fear than a person should feel in a single lifetime
And they've come so far
Given it all for this second chance
One second chance at life
Hollow man
You've gone too far
Secure in your safe little world
You have no idea the amount of pain you cause
Since when is a child a risk to your security?
Your razor wire and red tape killed their dreams
