[Re-release 2006 bonus track]

Gazing upon your face
Your love has released my heart
To drown
To sleep forever
In your sweet embrace
If i could reach the stars I'd place them in your eyes
Just to remind me of such a timeless beauty
Of you
Lost myself to you
I could not fall again
Held here by your grace
I'm bound forever by this
Infatuation
If i could
If i could reach the stars
I'd place them in your eyes
Just to remind me of such a timeless beauty
And when tomorrow tears you from my arms
I'll pray for one last sunset for our love
