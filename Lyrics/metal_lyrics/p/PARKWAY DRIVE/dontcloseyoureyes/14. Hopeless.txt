[Re-release 2006 bonus track]

Tear my heart from my chest
Still warm in my hands
Feel the life drain away
This distance is staggering
Stealing the air from my lungs
Choking me where i stand
Hopeless, just one last kiss
You sound so close
I can almost feel your breath
Too close to touch the fragment of my memory
Tormenting me forever
Haunting me forever
Stretching towards forever
Each second seems like a year
And this eternity is tearing me apart, tearing me apart
Hopeless
Victim of my own human desire
Love is a demon sent to destroy me
I never knew distance could kill


Thanks to badassaviatorsunglasses for sending tracks ## 9-14 lyrics.
