The warmth of your embrace
Has lifted me from the ground
The strength you've given me
I can never truly thank you
Through the darkness
I found you by my side
And I'll make this promise to you
I will never let you down
This is for every hour
This is for every second
This is for every moment
That we have shared together
Sky blue days burn through
I refuse to let our flame fade
Every scar burning bright tonight
I'd give my heart for you
I'd give my strength for you
I'd give my everything
I'd give my life for you
Tonight will stand as a testament to hope
Every scar, burning bright
I will stay by your side
Don't close your eyes
Tonight we burn together
My true friends, you mean the world to me
Your friendship means everything
Tonight will stand as a testament to hope
Forever beating on
