[Re-release 2006 bonus track]

Tell me, how does it feel
To watch a child bleed to death
From a weapon you designed?
You've spilt their blood
Is your pride really worth this? Such a mindless slaughter
Bow down to your greed
Bloodshed
Your lies cut their throat
Such beauty
Such innocence
Set to self destruct
As you nail their coffin shut
With your hammer of hate
The flesh is torn, hate remains
The
Flesh
Is
Torn
They bleed
Bloodshed
Broken by your hand
Who will bleed for you now?
