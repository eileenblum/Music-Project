Tragedy.
Another day lies broken and lost.
A shattered life cuts the pulse of acceptance.
And all I want is to be something more than this.
Another day lies broken and lost.
A shattered life cuts the pulse of Acceptance.
And all I want is to be anything but this.
Sleepless nights spent screaming for answers.
Cursing sweet venom at a wretched future.
An open casket stained with hope.
Laced with deceit and treachery.
An existence I only wish to forget.
Why do I always regret?
Those words leave the taste of blood.
Forget my face.
Just bury everything.
Why do I always let it go?
'cause I've let it slip away between my fingertips.
I've tried so fucking hard and still I could never gain a true understanding.
Chocking at our misery.
Splinters of failure cut like glass.
And I'm sick of just pouring myself out into careless hands.
Choking on our misery.
Splinters of failure cut like glass.
But I'll put it to rest tonight in the hope that maybe I won't have to wake.
I'll put it all to rest tonight.
Forget my face.
