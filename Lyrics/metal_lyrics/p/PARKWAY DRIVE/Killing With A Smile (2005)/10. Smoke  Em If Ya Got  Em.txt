Die
Thoughts replaced by a placid romance
Without movement, I can't escape
Die
Searching through the static
Twisted and torn inside out
Such blinding visions of destruction
So I have to question
Was this in the master plan?
'Cause now a broken future's all that we hold
Broken
Our broken future's all that we hold
Our day draws
To it's close
Dusk
Washes away
Integrity now bleeds away
As tired hearts are left to drain
Do you see their faces when you fall asleep at night?
Now they're nothing more than blood stained memories
Memories
Blood stained memories
