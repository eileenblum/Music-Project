If looks could kill.
You'd be a fucking shotgun
Against my head so fucking cold.
Picture perfect and pathetic.
I would so love to hang you.
Cat got your tongue?
Selling yourself short again?
You're selling yourself short again.
Bare your insecurities.
I want to see you cry.
I want to see your tears.
Why did you throw your heart away?
Why did you let yourself down?
Why did you throw your heart away.
Why did you let yourself down time and again.
Why did you throw you heart away.
So taste the skin and let your heartbeat slow.
Feel you bleeding away.
Lifeless.
Why did you let yourself down.
Why did you throw your heart away.
That cheap fucking smile carries you to bed.
And those lips are social suicide but I just want to see you dead.
You're like a shotgun baby.
Pointed at my head.
And those lips are suicide but I just want to see you dead.
