After everything you've done.
After your second face failed.
This time there's nothing left to save.
And your words were broken.
With the touch of vipers you set your words upon my back.
Spitting daggers you can't kill those already dead.
Buried beneath a pile of one liners and cheap attempts at honesty.
Buried so fucking far from your worthless lies.
And the fire.
The fire to cleanse your mouth.
You'll never awake from your hell and for a second you almost had me fooled.
Keep walking.
Keep breathing.
Keep cursing our names.
We're plotting your end by the dawn.
We're apparitions that stalk your every turn.
We're death incarnate to cleanse you from this world.
Midnight.
Until I see your face again.
Until I end this loveless dance.
Midnight.
Until I see you fucking scream.
And until I see the moonlight shine with your blood we'll dig your grave.
We'll dig your fucking grave.
Until I see your face again.
Until I end this loveless dance.
Midnight.
Until I see you fucking scream.
And until I see the moonlight shine with your blood.
Midnight.
Until I see your face again.
Until I end this loveless dance.
Midnight.
Until I see you fucking scream.
And until I see the moonlight shine red.
