You could never be my envy.
You could never be my jealousy.
You could never be my envy.
You could never be my jealousy.
A world without you is a world I could only wish for.
A world without you is a world I'd fucking die for.
You've taken everything...
Poison and despise lay in rampant wake in the shadows you have created
We've been left to drown in an endless tide of apathy
You disgust me
The guise of a true murderer
Killing with a smile
As your cyanide lips rip us apart
Now there'll be no forgiveness
'cause this is.... this is the end'
A world without you is a world I could only wish for,
And a world without you is a world I'd fucking die for.
So I'll hold that pretty face beneath the surface
Until your lungs hold nothing but the affliction you've created
This world is wasted on your life
Through evils eyes I've seen your soul betrayed
I'll watch you fucking drown
So I'll hold your pretty face beneath the surface
Until your lungs hold nothing
There'll be no forgiveness, no forgiveness
