Bludgeoned, bleeding, burning, screaming...barely alive.
Cattle feeding, hardly eating, waste of life.
Forest sweeping, slowly creeping, look in their eyes.
Bullets meeting flesh with teeth to rip out their insides.

Rage is a shadow behind me
Sorrow is what I will unleash.

It's time...the fabric is coming apart.

Smoking village, torn and pillaged, run for their lives.
Killing women, shooting children ...must stay alive.
I find one dead, gunshot in head...I look in his eyes.
With chewed off lips he smiles at me. I'm coming apart

Burns remind me I am here
I can't count the dead, I can't count the years.
Into the ditches as darkness falls.
I can smell them crawling through the pits of hell.

Like the sun, the explosions sear the sky.
Burning brightly, its shrapnel tastes my flesh.
I'm ripped apart, I have been ripped.
