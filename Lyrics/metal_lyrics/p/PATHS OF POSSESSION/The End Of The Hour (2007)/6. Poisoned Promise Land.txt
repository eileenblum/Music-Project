Vicious wounds cluttered upon my arms
Many marks I have forgotten
Steady rush as the nightmares take hold
Close my eyes to find the pieces
They are mine. they are mine.
Widening eyes as the light burns away
Assure myself I own the heavens
They are mine.

We are born into submission
We are approaching the hour
I can see everything
We are bound to a poisoned promise land
We are approaching
A poisoned promise land

Every scar has a story to fear
Every line a tale of terror
Swallowing stones that I should cast aside
Vomit the pride I should have honored
I should have honored

A poisonous land
I don't need your forgiveness
A poisonous land
I don't need your forgiveness
