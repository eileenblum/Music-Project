[Bonus Track][originally by Cancerslug]She beast of pagan lust
Awaits the blood to covet us
I know she is not afraid to slice my
Flesh and bind the trust
She's staring into me
As night surrounds this passion flame
She's seeing through me rage
Into my deepest darkest pain

This kiss will last forever
Endless tortured pleasure

Warmth dripping over me
The firelight upon our skin
The primal heart, it pounds
She screams and pulls me deeper in
To a place so moist and warm
A place we don't feel so alone
The world dissolves away
Two blackened hearts have become one

This kiss will last forever
Endless tortured pleasure

At night she calls to me
Through the moans and growls and stench of sweat
My own apocalypse
Resting my head upon her breast
She's all I know that is real
The juice of love now crusted thick
I feel the end that comes just like
The fuckside of my dick

There is nothing left for us to feel
But our own surrender
Nothing left for them to steal
All that we are is hollow and uselessness
All that we are soulless
