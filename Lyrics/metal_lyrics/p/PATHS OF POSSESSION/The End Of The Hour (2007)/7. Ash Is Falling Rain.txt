Blackened skies surround me
When I cut my veins
Everytime it is the same
Ash is falling rain
But why?

Floating down to earth
Burnt human remains
Choking all who inhale
This ashen falling rain

Wading through a sea of black
The mothers hunter their young
As starving beasts, a carnal curse
Apocalyptic dwellers, thin and grey

A fertile seed in the darkness
Peering out through open membrane

All is lost; it' raining death from the poisoned clouds
Breathe it in, feel it burn your lungs as you
Choke up blood, it starts to drain from your ears and eyes.
In time this will come

Feel it well, staring down at all the rest in
Agony, all but me
Sunken eyes, still and blank in the darkness
It's all the same in my dreams

With blazing eyes
I will crawl out from the womb
With two clenched fists full of her guts
I start to breathe,
I inhale everything
A hint of death blankets the air
But why?

Wet with blood, it's clotting up at the moment
I've seen the eyes of the dead, I have
Traveled back from the brink of forever
I am alone in this world

Now I know, now what I must do
I will go deeper still, I will
Journey back to the sea of ashes
And see what will become
