Those eyes, they bore into me
As I stripped the of their life.

How can this be? polluted memory.
All these things happened, were they real?

I can still feel, this hatred burns intense,
More than my memories from the past.
And who is he? I murdered violently.
This wretched vision through my mind, an open door.

This was not for your eyes.
This was not for you to see.
See me, I am forever.
Traveled into eternity's dark abyss.

They're calling me; I will be home in days.
All of these nightmares left behind.
My skin is burned.
More died, the more I learned.
A vicious killer I will leave in the ditches, I will leave behind.

This was not for your eyes.
This was not for you to see.
See me, I am forever.
The bloody truth is upon your distant gaze.

Dark twisting thoughts consume my head.
Time is standing still for my journey home.
A sickening reflection is staring me down.
As a monster, disfigured, I return to my world.

And for these things,
My people spit on me.
Do faceless cowards dare to speak?
The cringe beneath
Their gods and their beliefs,
Afraid to face me, I am forever.
