Black ageless fire
Surrounding fallen innocents
A haunting vision beckons me to this tainted place
As sanities split
I cannot recall the journey here
Born on the twilight of this future that will drown in blood

I cannot lead this blinded following
I cannot touch what they touch
I cannot taste this vengeance that's to be unleashed
I cannot feel the things you do

Burns on my face
Melted skin that will not heal
Corrupted smiles greet me everytime I turn around
As sanities split
We grant all unrelenting agony
Forced forward onto the edge of madness, I will follow you there

I will not lead this blinded following
I will not touch what they touch
I will not taste this vengeance that's to be unleashed
I will not feel the things you do

And when the sun burns out, the air
Will call upon our flesh
To bring our remains to the blackened shores
And I will not cry out
I will stand stronger still.
And mock that flames that cover all of you

And when they finally melt my flesh
I will laugh through the end
As I slowly crumble to the earth

You cannot breathe, you can't see anything
You'll slowly slip inside the flames

This panic spreads until we are all dead
A brand new slate to start again

Black ageless fire
Surrounding fallen innocents
A haunting vision beckons me here
