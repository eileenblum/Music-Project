I cannot count the number you'll reproduce
From the violation, an art that is ages old
One thing is all I have left to give to you
My seed, and the birth will follow suit

Heart, I'll have your heart
They'll rip your heart from you
And throw it on the ground

I have seen all of your petty crosses tonight
They'll never stop the likes of me
Her belly grows and she begins to scream in agony
Her vagina splits, and her offspring drop to the floor

Blood, I want what's owed me
Blood, I'll have what's owed me

There is a shadow, and it's moving in the dark
Moving silently, until it can taste its prey
It is upon her now, her eyes are horrorstruck

Blood, I have my blood
It's in her breat, it's flowing fresh for me
Morbid nourishment

One, that's all she's had
Wait there's one more, wait, there's two more.

Heart, I'll have your heart
They'll rip your heart from you
And throw it on the ground

Now that you have finished giving birth
You're the mother of mans downfall
Blood spurts from the gaping wound that used to be her breast
Cry out, that breath will be your last

Heart for a heart
Heart for a heart

Dying now the whore looks for us
But we're not there anymore
