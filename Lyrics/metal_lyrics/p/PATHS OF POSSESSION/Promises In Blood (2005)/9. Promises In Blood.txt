From the birth of Gods
We have traveled long
Have you come to bleed
Or have you come to learn?

No doors, just bodies, will open up my realm
Peel back the flesh, the stench leaks out
It won't be long

Call forth upon me, rain it falls like maggots from a body bag
A lone existence, a cold dark resistance
The ancient summons chant it fulls my lungs
I'm alive!

Ten thousand years of slumbering
You spoke the words to awaken me
Crawling forth from the bowels of the shadow
I spent time in eternal fire

One look inside me, you'll find where evil lies
Crawl back and feel the power burn, surge inside
You'll feel immortal; You are my host
I'll grant you power endlessly
As I slip inside the dominance will take control
Body will burn, one look inside you
I see a path of everlasting amnesty
Fall into the darkest corners of your mind, dead inside you'll

Be when I come
My friend, my friend

Live here with me, I will need you to stand
Feed on the dead flesh to nourish the man...
What man?

Rage forth in the hours twilight
Speak through speech you've never learned
Running through your thoughts desire of controlling me
I spent time in eternal damning fire

Or have you come to learn
Have you come to die

Ten thousand years of slumbering
I thank you for the awakening
Flashing through your mind, the truth of the summoning
Welcome to my world, now suffer!

No doors, just bodies, will open up my realm
Peel back the flesh the stench leaks out
It won't be long

Call forth upon me, rain it falls like maggots from a body bag
A lone existence, a cold dark resistance
The ancient summons chant it fills
My lungs, they spring to life, they're all I need to
Crawl inside your soul, I will be your
Master inside
