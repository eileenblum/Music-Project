Marching onward with one cause in mind
Christians will die!
Running, screaming, fleeing in fear
Run for your pathetic lives
Streets are wet with the blood of life

Bring me the head of Christ
All sheep fall on your knees
Bow

Trudging through the halls with weapons in hand
Call down your God of lies
We will come, welcome to your demise

Bring me the head of Christ
Burn he will for all time
Crawling through the grass
Weeping in fear, we've found him
Bring me the head of Christ
Begging now for his life
Grab him, take him, crying in fear, cry for me now

Cry
