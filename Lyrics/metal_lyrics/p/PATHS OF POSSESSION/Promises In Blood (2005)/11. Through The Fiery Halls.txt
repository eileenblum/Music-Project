As I stand outside in the pouring rain
I turn to look at the world again
I am standing tall before my judgment
And my head is held up high onto the heavens I defy
Heavens that I deny

As I'm staring up at the burning skies
Now I know where I reside
I am standing strong amongst my brothers,
And we all have a voice uplifting through the halls
I am servant to no god

As I look up to the dying world above
There's nothing left but dirt and blood and
I take pride in knowing that I
Never swore allegiance to a god

There's no god
No god
For life
For death
I am for myself
I am servant to no god
