I've stared at the wind
For what feels like forever now
And all I wait for is you
The icy flow of death come
Life was forced upon me
Abandonment, people ran afraid
I scrambled for air
But only reached a bloody path
All are withered and gone

All but us - now we are the same
I have waited for you
Come to kill me father

Come, come for me
I'll take you home, I'll take you down with me

You have taken from me everything that I could have been
I have taken from you everything that you ever were

Come - Share with me your emptiness
Share with me your desires
Come - Share will me all that you are now

You have taken from me everything that I could have been
I have taken from you everything that you ever were

Come - Share with me your rage inside
Share with me all your hate
Come - Share with me all that you thought you were

Cold - Death's coming soon

Come - Share with me your emptiness
Share with me your desires
Come - Share with me all that you thought you were

Now we are alone at last
Hopelessness - A swelling fear inside
We are facing the end
Father listen - Can you hear it come

A burning blaze - Set upon your grave
A burning blaze - Set upon your grave
