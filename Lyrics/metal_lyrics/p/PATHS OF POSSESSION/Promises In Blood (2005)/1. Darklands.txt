Come, welcome to the darklands

Regions of darkness untouched by god
Miles of nothing to practice my art
Pain, I'm in charge of pain, my home

Too far for the living too close for the dead
Your eyes will see the horror
Madness will take you long before you die
You will never die

Collecting their souls become my slaves
Welcome to my paradise where decades are days
The flames you will call them home
I welcome you

Too far for the living too close for the dead
Fortress for unholy penance
Inside well take you far beyond known pain

Hate breathing in my veins

I like the killing man is my game
Mortals angels they all die the same
Scream I love to hear them scream

Long ago when the battle raged
Were cast out in shame
The time is near take arms and fight with me
