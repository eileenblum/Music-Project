In my eyes I see through fury
A gaze from hell
The legions of your lord are turning
You built your church upon our lands, unholy lands
Your cross forced upside down and burning
In my eyes

Winters heavy here - but blood melts snow
Regiments from the south -  drove up hard
Killing ceaselessly - burning towns
Toppled all our shrines and they drove them to the ground
In my eyes

All retaliate - drive them back
Swords will sing when wetted in their flesh
Drive them to their doorsteps - burn their lands
Stare them in their eyes and lets remind them of our home

How can I not see

In my eyes I see through fury
A gaze from hell
At last the rage inside is churning
Your built your church upon our lands, unholy lands
Your priest pinned upside down and burning
He's burning!
In my eyes

Winters heavy here, but blood melts snow
As the years go by, the wounds don't heal
Retribution beckons, calls me home
Forefathers know this; they will never know peace here
How can I not see, now can I not see, how can I not see
In my eyes I see through fury
