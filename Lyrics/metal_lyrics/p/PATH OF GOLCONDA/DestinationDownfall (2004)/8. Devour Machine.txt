How does it feel to be raped and raped again
Infernal molestation of your body, mind and soul
Virginal skin drags in endless pain
You're just meat to be raped and raped again

Helpless caged in my cellar
But you are not alone
Whispered spells of downfall
Death blooms in every wound

A new day full of agony
As I enter your pit again
Those pale grey shrouds are buried soon -
Save your cries in vain

All your senses are destroyed
for the one of pain
lurking like your promised lies
You're up to be raped again

Hark! Oh restless spirit!
enfold thy fatal grasp for me
For night shall be my realm
Condemned to these lies I am
Colourful my visions are
But also rich with hate
And so your existence is
The only thorn in my eye

Solace in my veins
From passion turned to wicked greed
Thou my beloved daemon
Is it you I have to kill?

Lo! This rose with poisoned thorns and steady falling leaves
This shall be my final fall into the black of endless grief...

Yeah, how does it feel ?
Before your master you shall kneel
Revenge always a bitter taste
may help my aching heart to heal

How does it feel to be raped and raped again
Infernal molestation of your body, mind and soul
Virginal skin drags in endless pain
You're just meat to be raped and raped again

Helpless caged in my cellar
But you are not alone
Whispered spells of downfall
Death blooms in every wound
