Fattened winds of sindustries have called upon thee
deflorating nature with tornado licks
orbital ca-ballets of catastrophe
dancing at the edge of revelation-
Imminent, malevolent- a cruel upheaval
Struggling forth to wipe away this virus-race
forgotten ghouls have sought to choose, ghostly grinning
with blinded spells and from disgrace
feeds the fall of mankind.....

Carven into the flesh of this sleaze
-breathing the stench of decline-
a wave to end the disease:
Calling the Tide!

The anticlimax of this drama, haughty and condemned to fail
Fading lonely, whining wholly storms of time too strong to sail

Carven into the flesh of this sleaze
-breathing the stench of decline-
a wave to end the disease:
Calling the Tide!

From allusion to reversal
Falls the poetry of loss
And with broken, lengthened fingers
From the ruins of moral lingers
A dream to tear, a mind to twist
One drowns and sinks and both eclipse...

The Gates of Hellotopia opened wide
As the great red harlot with covetous thighs
Is pleasured by the worms of carcass ecstasy
Let me swallow shallow
Decadence-
Away with the flood
With curtain, bow and dank cascades
A final cast in lot with
Diabolo ex machina

Carven into the flesh of this sleaze
-breathing the stench of decline-
a wave to end the disease and
Man keeps up calling the Tide
