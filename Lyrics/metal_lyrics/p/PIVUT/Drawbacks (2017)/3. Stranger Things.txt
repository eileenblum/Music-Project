I been thinking that this melody would save me
Everyday, fighting with the entity
They said
Everything was alright
But I won't make it
Another night

What will I amount to?
Nobody knows
What will I amount to?
Everything you loathe

Everything you want is everything I need
Living quietly is something I can never be

Speak out, of your mind
Share with the world
The louder side

Without an echo, I can hear clarity
Too dark for shadows, light is a mystery
You should embrace it
'Cause soon you'll have too

I gave this world a chance,
But it chewed me up and spit me out
But it chewed me up and spit me out

I'll never make it
But I don't want to
It's not me, it's you
