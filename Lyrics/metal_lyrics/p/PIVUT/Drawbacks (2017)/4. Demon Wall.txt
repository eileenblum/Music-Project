Have you ever questioned your humanity?
Like the game you hunt that helps feed the weak
Is it survival or pleasure you seek?
'Cause it seems like your heart is a bit off beat

You can't be strong without a painful past
You can't be strong without a painful past
You can't be strong without a painful past

We haven't had the pleasure of standing face to face
You're like a rabbit
Appetizer to my dinner plate
I am the alpha here to claim your fate
And once I sink my teeth too deep
You'll see why they call me
The survivor of Amdapor Keep

I came to reclusion
And I thought it would suffice
But what's left of me
Is only the fight

Thankful for my struggle
I have shed some light
Escaped thee abyss
And relieved the spite
Erased my mind
And shuffled the deck
I put the pieces back
In a different mess

I won't be your victim
I'd give it a rest
I'd give it a rest

I won't
Take it
Any
More
More

I won't take it
I won't take it
I won't take it
Anymore
