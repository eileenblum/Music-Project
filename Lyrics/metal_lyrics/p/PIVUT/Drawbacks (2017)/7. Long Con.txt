Time to set things straight
You're a fucking fake
I won't relive, my past mistakes

You heard right, I said it first
Another lie makes it worse
Keep that in mind
The next time you run our way

Since we're being honest, you'd make quite the novelist
Poorly written plot twists, embedded in your head

Pardon my confusion
All I hear is music
Deaf to the words, that brought me to my knees

I won't feel sympathy
For all that you have done to me
Trusting the damned, is the price you'll pay

Stuck in the eyes, of the ones that betray
More or less
There's one decision to make
Living with malice, or be left in the wake
Forgiveness or belligerence
Which will you take
Either way bodes ill, for the one, that's been played

Pardon my confusion
All I hear is music
Deaf to the words, that brought me to my knees

I won't feel sympathy
For all that you have done to me
Trusting the damned, is the price you'll pay

I walked the path that led to this letdown
Entrapped, I felt your wrath, the knife in my back

I been had, I been hoaxed,
Do you think it's a fucking joke?
No more reason, to believe in,
The kind of people with no motive or grievance

All is lost when there's something to gain
I won't succumb to your perpetual pain
Not dead, not broke, but my conscience spoke
I'll be what you regret most
