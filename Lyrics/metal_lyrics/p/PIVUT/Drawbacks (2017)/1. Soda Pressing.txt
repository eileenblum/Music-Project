You don't have the mind to create
Anything, anything
Yet you walk around with that
Undeserved grin on your face

Manipulating so called friends
One by one, again and again
Those famous lines
Things have finally changed

You're only here,
To get what you came for
Same vicious cycle
Over and over

Reality a tough pill to swallow

Your same bullshit ways
Same shit, different day

This world's better off without you
Bringing down my fucking pride

We're all better off without you
A lost cause, your demise

This world's better off without you
Bringing down my fucking pride

We're all better off without you
A lost cause, your demise
