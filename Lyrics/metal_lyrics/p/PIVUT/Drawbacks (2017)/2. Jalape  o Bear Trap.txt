If there's one thing I need to say
I'm better off without your mental break
And when thing starts to turn grey
You'll understand why I left this place

Full of contemplation
Your a drug to me

Shut up
Time to learn subordination
Your ego makes me cringe

Get up
Time to turn the situation
Otherwise you'll never live

Shut up
Time to learn subordination
Your ego makes me cringe

Get up
Time to turn the situation
Otherwise you'll never live

I won't be subject to this
Found with a bullet in the back of your head
Run your mouth, you'll be found dead

Take the blame, off me
I made the choice, to breathe
I couldn't save, your misery

Another soul to rest in peace
Either way, I'm afraid
I'd be giving my life away
You don't know, 'til you feel
The guilt trip become real

You were a rose
And I ignored the thorns
Doesn't mean I can withstand the scars
Blinded by your own beauty

I'm just glad it wasn't me
I'm just glad it wasn't me
I'm just glad it wasn't me
I'm just glad it wasn't me
