They tried to bury us
They didn't know we were seeds
Deep-sixed for barely much
I'll plant my roots; hemlock

It's gonna take a lot more to bring me down
I am the voice of this revelation
Truth be told I'm not a fuckin' saint
Just a corpse trying to exist

I'll die another day
I'll die another day
Water your dead plants
But they'll still decay

Another day
Another day
Wasted carving my headstone
But keep the date the same

Don't make this face the last you see
Heaven may hold it against you

There's been a drought
Bring the rain
It's only a matter of time

Full of shit
Your lungs have no use
I'll take apart everything

Everything you own
Get inside your head
So you're not alone

I'll patronize everyone you've ever known
