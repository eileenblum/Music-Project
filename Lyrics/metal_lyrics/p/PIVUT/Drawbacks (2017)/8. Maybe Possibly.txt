I'm stuck in this never ending glitch
Trying to understand the human bliss
A euphoric anomaly
That would never exist

If mom and dad had never met
And time was never kept
Then what would be left
Of this life you expect

'Cause I'm stuck in this never ending glitch
Trying to understand the human bliss
A euphoric anomaly
That would never exist

A fundamental craving
The desire to transcend
Beyond the bars of perception
Just for a moment

A heightened state of enjoyment
Revealed to yourself
Free from doubt and disappointment
Your brains subliminal importance

A fundamental craving
The desire to transcend
Beyond the bars of perception
Just for a moment

When the past and present blend
And the color index ends
What's left is redundancy
Painted by you and me

Out emerges the truths
Compiled of misuse
'Cause all I am is a fiend
For an extraordinary scene

Prevented by travesty
And the way you look at me
I feel the transparency
Of my relapsed apology

I'm afraid of my own mistakes
They led me to this fucking place
I'm afraid of my own mistakes
They led me to this fucking place

I should of opened my mind
And let in your insight
Instead I wasted my time
Seeking more to this life

I won't ever go back to me
I won't ever go back to me
I won't ever go back to me
I won't ever go back
