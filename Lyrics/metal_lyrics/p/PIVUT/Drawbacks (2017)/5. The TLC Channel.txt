What was a choice is now a chore
I don't deny that anymore
I woke up face first on the floor
With my mouth dried up
And my body's sore

The odds are against me

The thought of death feels like a reality
Withdrawn from my confidence
So much for being optimistic
I left myself in the bottom of my mug

It's a poison flowing through my veins
And I can't find a remedy
A quick fix, a shot in my coffee
Just enough to keep me knocking on your door

They tell me it deceives morality
But they seem misconstrued
'Cause we're all addicted to something
That takes away the pain from you

Drunken thoughts speak a sober truth
And I'm four sheets to the wind
This is a problem
Because of you
We already talked, I already fought
And you already know the truth
This is a problem
Because of you

Do I have a problem?
Or maybe I don't give a fuck

In alcohols defense
I've done some pretty dumb things sober
My liver tells me one thing
But my heart another

Both a fight I'll never win
Add them to my list of sins

Both a fight I'll never win
Add them to my list of sins
'Cause there'll be others like you
