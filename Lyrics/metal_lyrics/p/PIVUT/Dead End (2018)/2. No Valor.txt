I been told before I don't know better
Then to let you inside my head
I don't know if you're trying to change me
But you can't go from black to red
When you look in my eyes
Do you see yourself?
NO! Because I'm already making
The decisions myself
Whenever I start to lighten up
You find a way to let me down
And just when I've had enough
You always come back around
Everyday ends with a nightmare
I've watched you shed your skin
You take solace in captivating
Now you're taking hostages
Tonight's the night we let it all out
Tonight's the night we let 'em all out
Save your friends from themselves
Save your friends from themselves

Let this be a lesson
You won't forget
Sit down and brace yourself
For the truth to make its rounds
Everyone knows you only cope
By playing someone else
You're spineless and bleak
Can't get your story straight
When you lie
Right through your teeth
There's no valor too reap
When all you've really done is cause more grief
And you'd wait 'til the day I die
To forgive
