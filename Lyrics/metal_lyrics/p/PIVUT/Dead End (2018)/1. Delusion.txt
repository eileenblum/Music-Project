10 past 2 and I'm still alive
Wide awake, give me something to take
I've been nocturnal my whole life
What's it to you, I'm not you

Consequences of today
You won't listen to a word I say
Reflect on my own self
Am I wrong to become someone else?
It motivates, myself, to look past
All of your doubt
I'm still looking for your intentions
I'm slipping through the cracks of this road you paved
I won't stand for your resentment
I won't stand for your resentment

I won't bleed I'm still thawing out my heart
You can try, go ahead
Tear me apart
Carry me through thick and thin
The sinkhole beneath me is my weakness
This delusion needs to be addressed
'Cause all we do is fucking digress
This delusion needs to be addressed
'Cause all we do is fucking digress
There is light to be found when lost in the dark.
The northern sky takes you back, right to my heart.
But you'll never hear me say, we should hit restart.
Since the only way through is to form new scars.
It's resilience you lack,
That's just a matter of fact.
You gave me something to consider
I'm turning my back.
So fuck what you think, and what you been told.
'Cause only the dead have seen the end of the war
