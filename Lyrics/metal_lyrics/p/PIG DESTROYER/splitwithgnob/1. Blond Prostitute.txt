the vomit on your lips tastes like the sex of a twin sister I can hear your stomach knot as another threshold is reached and crossed imagination is the key so destroy with the nails repair with the tongue and repeat it only hurts if you look I am a velvet corpse kneeling before you and for a split second your eyes were lambs as my fingers slipped around your neck on the way to heaven
