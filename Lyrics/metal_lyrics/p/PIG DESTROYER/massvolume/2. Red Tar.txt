In the moment of truth
I stuck with the lie
Got lost in the smoke
Became a slave
To a weak mind

Need to kill a hawk
Need to steal some wings
Blood like red tar

Overdosed on cynicism
Swept under and drowned
Lured in by a siren
I ran my ship aground
Slash of talon
Glimpse of Venus
Tidal waves crashing down

Need to kill a hawk
Need to steal some wings

Grief crawls in the shadow of time
Try to keep in mind
It's all finite.
