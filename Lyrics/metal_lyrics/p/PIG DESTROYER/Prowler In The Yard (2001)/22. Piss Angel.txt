I see you headless with me caressing your neck
My personal nightfall
An eclipse of the sunflowers
I feel so invisible
So unknown
A coffin of dust
An illegible tombstone
They finally buried the gravedigger in the sky
I just need to shower in your amber and bathe in your earth

Everyone quickly hushed up and took a step back as
Jennifer rose and stood over the girl,
Examining her handiwork.
Her partner layed motionless beneath her, seemingly dead.
Her eye sockets dry and empty.
Her heels and elbows scraped and bloodied.
Some on-lookers gasped in horror.
Some swooned and fainted melodramatically.
Most just stared in disbelief.
Jennifer reached down between her thighs and pulled
The crotch of her bathing suit to the side - exposing
Her vagina.
The other girl slowly sat up and began sliding her fingers into Jennifer.
A few minutes later, her wrists were in, then her elbows. Eventually she would completely disappear into her womb.
Jennifer tilted her head to the side curiously.
She heard the sound of a rickety-wooden roller-coaster in the distance.
It's passengers screaming in mock terror.
She knew that sooner or later they would realize that the
Ride wasn't stopping and they were all going to die.
