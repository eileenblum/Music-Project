I never could escape you
Your wings forever
In silhouette of the sun
Climbing
The mountain
She's wearing her latest victim on her arm
Hurry up
My disguises don't last long
They donï¿½t last long
Scan the room for exits
Granite pulverized in a clenched fist
We're making out in the landfill splashing around
Waist deep in ash
Waist
Deep
In
Ash
And in my crawlspace of a heart
There's no rancor
Like rats
Like rats
Thereï¿½s rancor
Like rats
Like rats
