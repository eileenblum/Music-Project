Shannon's got an eye
For shallow graves
And a stomach
That can handle all the gore
Her sister Lucy's in charge
Of selection (of selection)
Seduction (seduction)
And complete lack of remorse
They'll take his wallet
Down to the mall
For the jewelry
And the perfumes they adore
Then they'll drive
Out to Route Five
And leave his carcass by the reservoir
They got cornered last year
Down in a Nashville hotel
The girls
Had to chop a whole S.W.A.T. team to pieces
