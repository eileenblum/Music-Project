The girl in the Slayer jacket
Gave me my first kiss
When I was in the seventh grade
She used to smoke
Weed with my older sister
In the woods behind the arcade
The woods behind the arcade
She had thick skin
But if you cut her
The wound
Would bleed forever
She would bleed forever
She
She would bleed forever
She hung herself
From an overpass
Down in McLean
Where the old trees loom
(her parents tried to sue Slayer they blamed her)
Her parents
Tried to sue Slayer
They blamed her boyfriend and PCP
But the truth is her eyes
Had been dead since she was five
She just hadn't disposed of her body
