Strange tension in the harbor tonight
I watch the rich girls down on Duke St. pass me by
That pass me by
Now the nausea's
In my guts
And I'm wrestling with doubt
The kind you get when your heroes
Sell you out
And as I watch the drawbridge come down
There's mass extinction
On my mind
Extinction on my mind
Extinction on my mind
Extinction
On my mind
Human cruelty stains my thoughts jet black
I've got this feeling
Like things have gone too far and now we can't get back
