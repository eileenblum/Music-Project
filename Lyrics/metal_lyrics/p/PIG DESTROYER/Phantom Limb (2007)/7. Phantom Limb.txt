It came to me in my sleep
Green light spilling from its mouth
All over me
Laughter that sounds like metal scraping
Eyes like a pair of atoms splitting
Face like a funhouse mirror twisting
I put my hand
Up to the wall and it passed right through
I put my hand
Up to the wall and it passed right through
You should've been there
You could've come with me
