My sisters dangerous. She climbs the barbed wire fence. Changes
clothes in the back seat. Medical gown to red jeans. I can tell shes
off her meds, cause she's grinning like a deathâs head. Like a slit
wrist angel. The asylum lights up, as we pull away. The doctors donât
get it, my sister canât be kept in a cage.
