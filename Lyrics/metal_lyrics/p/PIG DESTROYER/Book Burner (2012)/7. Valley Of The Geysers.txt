no car no job no dollar sign. no net to land in
this time. where death has no cruelty. addiction just a memory. i
track the impala. slay the bear with a spear. all i have is my hunger.
in the valley of the geysers. all my teeth fall out. twenty canines
take their place. exile from the human race. in the shadow of the
volcano. finally i am alive.
