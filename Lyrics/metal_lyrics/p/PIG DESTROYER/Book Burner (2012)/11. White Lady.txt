lamar never makes it easy. he always wants to meet me
someplace sketchy. i stick out like a sore thumb in this part of d.c.
hes forty minutes late he keeps trying to gouge me on the price like a
prick. whatever. as long as the powders legit. im all stoked. i got my
fix. then these thugs roll up. with bad intentions.
