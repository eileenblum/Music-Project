she's got a neck
built for my hands
the way a pine
grows for the saw
they say I hate women
they couldn't be more wrong
she's got a pierced lip
and a mohawk
and a strut
that reminds me of a tiger
I think she's a waitress
at rocket to venus
I've seen her flipping
records at reptilian
the other day
I followed her
all the way
from hopkins to the harbor
I lost her in the crowd
when the o's game let out
I never saw that girl again
and it's a shame
I just wanted to hold her
like an anaconda
