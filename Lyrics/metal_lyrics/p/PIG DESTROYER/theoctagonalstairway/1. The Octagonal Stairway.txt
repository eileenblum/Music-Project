i hid under cover
waited for my orders
a clown whispered in my ear
you're not a soldier
i awoke with a grail in my hand
i sipped it as i went down
the octagonal stairway
compassion
was my weakness
i declared war
for no reason
then i awakened
brass knuckles on my hands
i punched the walls as i went down
the octagonal stairway
i laid in the hearse
saw the southern lights
and i awakened
with a novel in my hand
i read it as i descended
the octagonal stairway
