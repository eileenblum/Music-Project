Huh!
Down on the street
Where the faces shine.
Floatin' around I'm
A real low mind.
See a pretty thing - ain't no wall.
See a pretty thing - ain't no wall.
No wall,
No wall,
No wall.
Uuh!
Yeah deep in the night
I'm lost in love.
Yeah deep in the night
I'm lost in love.
A thousand lights
Look at you.
A thousand lights
Look at you.
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost - yeah.
Huh
Faces shine - real low mind.
Real low mind.
I'm a real low mind.
Real low mind
