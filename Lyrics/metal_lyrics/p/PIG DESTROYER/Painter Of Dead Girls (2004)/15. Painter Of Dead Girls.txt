I see the pale girl in a red dress on the stairs of a sinking mansion
Her siblings take me to her sometimes they say she's my ghost
Sent back to rape this body and that I'm a painter of dead girls
Sleeping with the same vultures that tear the flesh from my inspiration
She comes to me obscured a distant figure in the rainfall
