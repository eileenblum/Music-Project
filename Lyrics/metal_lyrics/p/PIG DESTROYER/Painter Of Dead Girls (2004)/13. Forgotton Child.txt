A sliver of star dances through my sky
To crash into another lifetime
Always the journey never the destination
Those lovely columns of fanged smoke
Wander through plastic gardens
Where kisses blown at a forgotten love
Still drift looking for a face in a world of masks
I see a light on a dead horizon
Glowing like a bed of sapphires in a sea of ash
But it's a distraction and nothing more
Just an instrument to measure the darkness
That swallows me from time to time
