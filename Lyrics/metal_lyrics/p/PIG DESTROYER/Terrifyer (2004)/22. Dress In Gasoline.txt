[Japanese Edition Bonus Track]You listen closely to my words
When you should be watching my hands
She likes to soak
Her best dress in gasoline
And dance too close to the fire
We can't walk
Hand in hand
If we're always making fists
Sometimes I think I'd rather starve
Than keep gorging myself with nothing
