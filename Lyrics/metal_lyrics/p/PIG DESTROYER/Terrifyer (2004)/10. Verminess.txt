When she touches me it's like a rodent sifting through garbage,
but it's better than just rotting away.
When she kisses me her lips are like chalk.
Beneath empty socket eyes compassion takes too much effort.
I suppose the dead honeybees suckle withered flowers
because they don't know what else to do.
