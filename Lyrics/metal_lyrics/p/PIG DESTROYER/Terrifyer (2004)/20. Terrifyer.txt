These strange thorned vines spring from the ground,
they wind around me as they bind me down.
She moves across the rose garden
suspended in a dark cloud of flies.
Her toes drag the tops of the flowers
and leave them blackened and shriveled in her wake.
Her hands dangle from thin strings of skin.
Her forearms they're like gun barrels smoking crimson.
