The tape across your mouth says more than your words ever could.
You're squirming and screaming as I tease your eyes with glowing needles.
Crawl slug, drag your shattered legs behind.
I know no matter how much I hurt you
she'll always love you more than me,
but all of this isn't for the sake of her love.
It's for the sake of my jealousy.
