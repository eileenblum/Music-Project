Buildings collapse in the distance behind you
but I'm hypnotized by your quivering voice,
your fluttering eyes,
that I don't see them fall.
They could crack open all the cages,
set every demon free,
send a bullet screaming to the president's head,
crack it open for everyone to see.
I'm dead to this world,
so bury me deep in your arms tonight.
