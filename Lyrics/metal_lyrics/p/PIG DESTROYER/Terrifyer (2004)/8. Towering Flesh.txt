she frolics through the rain
whispering love insane.
her kisses exit through
heart-shaped exit wounds.

Her skin like flesh of angels.
Her blood my catholic wine.
It moves slowly through me,
disintegrates my spine.

she's got heroin embraces
that I still need to be in.
I force myself to loathe her
so I can fall for her again.
So I can fall for her again.

[2x]
Her lips are wet with venom.
Her posture's serpentine.
she'll touch my arm and
flowers grow there
poisonous and obscene

all her shrugged little movements
and their despotic majesty.
in the midst of such perfection
I can't help but feel diseased.
