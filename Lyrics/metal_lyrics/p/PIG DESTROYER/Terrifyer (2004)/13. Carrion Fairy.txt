Yesterday she showed me her bruises,
pulled her sweater up underneath her breasts.
They were scattered 'cross her rib cage,
like a little patch of violet Rorschach tests.
She said, âJust 'cause I can't crawl inside you
that doesn't mean I'm not your parasite.â
She used to be so radiant,
so sexy when she laughed.
Now her eyes look like gravesites as she speaks in epitaphs.
