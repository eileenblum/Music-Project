Your heart looks delicious she says licking her lips
as her kamikaze fists crash into floating ribs.
I stare at you the way you stare at your mirror.
So please show me no mercy,
don't be a soft assassin.
I scream though I'm laughing inside.
I know you can't destroy me but you're adorable when you try.
