single file lemmings we prepare our mandate in effect simply a testament
to our gullability with each pull of the lever we lend credibility
to an institution which we can only repaint never reconstruct our percieved power
of change so divided and spread so thin so as to be rendered ineffective
if the collective voice cannot be heard then the collective wrath must be felt.
