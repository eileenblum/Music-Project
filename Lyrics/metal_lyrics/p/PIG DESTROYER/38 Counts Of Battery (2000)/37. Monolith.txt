archaic bureaucracy doomed from the outset bloated and hedonistic invincible
and inert a bedridden monolith of uselessness we lack the fortitude
to pull the plug unable to envision our lives without it instead
we maintain a two hundred year vigil praying for a miracle of some kind
not realizing that every day of mourning is also a day of regression
social evolution is neutralized by antiqued tradition.
