single-file lemmings prepare the mandate in effect simply a testament
to our gullibility each pull of the lever lends credibility to an institution
which we can only repaint never reconstruct our perceived power
of change divided and spread so thin so as to be rendered ineffective
if the collective voice cannot be heard then the collective wrath must be felt.
