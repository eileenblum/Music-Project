playing the silent movie villain scrambling to tie myself to train tracks.
praying for technicolor in the afterlife i swear that eccentric on the 
street corner was talking about my world ending and now i feel like i am 
being followed.
when i saw the little blonde girl reading the book on horses and i wished 
her comatose i began to feel sick but they tell me that i am better now.
