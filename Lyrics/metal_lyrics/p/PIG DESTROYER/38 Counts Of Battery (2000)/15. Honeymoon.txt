i always thought it fitting the way they chose the next victim with a 
bouquet of dying flowers and how happy they appeared as they ducked into the 
smiling hearse
but i quite fancied them losing their lifeblood in a hotel room somewhere 
with a lot of palm trees because eventually they will see that our 
weaknesses are all
it takes to make the most devine of flowers wither.
