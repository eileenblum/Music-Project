all star crossed and stary eyed innocence pulled away by maturity's tide, 
lonliness as the void into which all this warped obsession is cast, shyness 
as the dam denying the river it's ultimate purpose, deafened by all the 
silent laughter under the whispered promises which rusted down to jagged 
lies anyway. stab me again my sweet little murderer.
