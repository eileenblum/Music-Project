foolish young visionary your proximity to the corrupt epicenter razes
your walls of morality walls of protection or of concealment temtation
of raw power acquiescence subsequent exposure leaves you impaled
on your own karmic pike with gun as pen blood as ink you draft
the final tragic act your long suppressed conscious finally liberated
through the exit wound.
