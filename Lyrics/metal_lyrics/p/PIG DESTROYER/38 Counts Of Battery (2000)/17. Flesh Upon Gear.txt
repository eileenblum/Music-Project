maudlin idea of government abolition noble in intention absurb in lack of 
realism mirage of a sinister brain. trust our denial and desperation. force it
into existence we are outnumbered because we are the enemy. too numerous to
pinpoint too powerful to vanquish and too apathetic to reproach a gigantic 
flesh and bone mechanization with it's gears all trying to turn 
independently of one
another by design destined to run horribly amok.
