Ignorance is no excuse arrogance is not the answer
To open eyes alone is worth the price to be paid
Ignorance is no excuse

Afraid of something so you kill it
Strapped to a table you dissect it
Fear of the unknown will be your downfall
Apathetic pathetic take all the lies
Half truths falsifications we see through your feeble whines will not fall by the wayside
