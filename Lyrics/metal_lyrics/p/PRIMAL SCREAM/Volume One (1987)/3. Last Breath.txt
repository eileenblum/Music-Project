Pain and torment coming your way
The reapers hacking down your door
A shroud of silence darkens your soul
You have no place to run or go
Take your last breath

Reeking sweat drips from your brow you feel your time is near
A faint murmur rings in your ear you know your time is near
Whirling and spinning your body slams down your course you are headed for doom
There is no answer to what you will take your body has rotted to waste
