Sunrise alone again I close my eyes curl up tight protected from the ultraviolet light
Dangerous rays deliver me the darkness the sun it hurts my eyes
Symptom of a sickness few can understand horror land

I cannot take much more of this senses screaming dangerous
Pale skin turning red kill the light kill it dead
Sundown and growing stronger I am the shadows growing longer
Reign forever rule the night sunrise coming kill the light
