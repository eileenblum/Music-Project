Simple things for simple minds harmless thoughts mental crimes
Psychotherapy for the masses without reason without rhyme
A primal scream to clear your throat searching hard for the antidote
Aggressive desires oppressive environs the reason the fault
Exploited beyond compare misguided fair is fair grinds me to a halt
Bear down drive hard cry rights war and sin
