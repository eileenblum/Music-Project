Drink of my cup sample my mead
Golden loaves fulfil a need
Gorge yourself until you are sated
Taste the ale taste my hatred
Arsenic hemlock belladonna

Lie still the deeds been done
The battle is over it has been won
Take your place amongst the dead
I will like the throne in your stead
Arsenic hemlock belladonna

Can this Norseman be kept down
Or will the toxins seize his crown
Lifeline pounds a beat of fury
Arctic blood he will rage in glory
Arsenic hemlock belladonna
