Love thy mother obey thy father betrayed by brother
Deceitful son shot on sight
Reign of terror watching each move
Do not move in haste step back you will lose shot on sight

I was born a king I was born to rule
I have enslaved you all you were the fools
Now you disown me and I am dethroned
But I took your lives and burnt down your homes
