My name is Mr Creedy welcome to my home
The macabre and bizarre is all I have ever known

Closed shutters hide broken windows weeds overgrown
Dangling branches cast strange shadows creak and moan

My name means nothing nothing to you
But wait and watch my friend I am almost through

Blackened darkness fills my world I am calling to you
My existence cannot compare I thrive on you
