Behold, the lord will come in fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury.
Displays of wonder light up the sky, and then the sun fades into the black, the moon turns into blood.
"The evil one's among us" so they said, and there's no telling when this is all gonna end.
So it is enough to merely just repent, when the righteous remain complicit and content.
Oh, what have they done.
The godless have sinned.
Don't look at me.
The End of Days has begun.
The time is at hand, just wait and see.
Last call to kill with god's will.
Then they came to us from afar, and from the heavens,and their weapons of wrath destroyed all the land and all the sinners.
Yeah, the sinners.
The time had come for the dead to be judged and to destroy those who destroyed the earth and each other.
And on "the day" the masses were awakened.
The stars fell en masse, the heavens shaken.
Many a man had disgraced the house of god.
The end was said to be swift, the judgment hard.
Oh, what have they done.
The godless have sinned.
Don't look at me .
The "End Of Days" has begun.
The time is at hand, just wait and see.
Last call to kill with god's will.
