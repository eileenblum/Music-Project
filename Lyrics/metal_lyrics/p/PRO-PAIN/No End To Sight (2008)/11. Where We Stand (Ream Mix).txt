[Bonus track]

Bound, gagged, shackled, silenced, and sentenced to die when I broke no law.
Left for dead as I gazed at the sun through holes and cracks in my door.
A voice said: "All I know is where we stand, leave your cell, embrace your fate come the end."
Bludgeoned,tortured, starved and loathed by those in the name of god and of man.
I lie at their mercy and I swear by the cross, my blood is forever on their hands.
the voice cried: "All I know is where we stand, believe yourself, embrace your faith come the end"
WAIT.
