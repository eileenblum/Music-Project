Revelation overload.
Zeal is in the air.
Reap all of what has been sowed.
Do we even care.
Yeah.
Live, therefore we die.
We shed no tears.
God knows we tried to see the light and all the world just as one nation.
Desperate, we scream up to the sky, under one flag waving goodbye.
Come ride with me out to the sea of godless salvation to never return.
Stone the gates of splendor and punish those inside.
Famine, war, and pestilence.
On death's horse we'll ride.
Yeah.
Kill, therefore we pray.
We'll let no tears get in the way of this crusade, but now we find that god only listens.
Keeping the last days in our sight, we forge ahead and blindly we fight, and on "the day" others shall pay for our decision to never return.
