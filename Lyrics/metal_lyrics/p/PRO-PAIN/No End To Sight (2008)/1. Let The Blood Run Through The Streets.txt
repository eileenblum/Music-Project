You say you want a new bloody revolution, and you want to save the world.
What is your solution.
It's time to protest, it's within our rights.
Well, we ain't going down without a mother fucking fight.
Cause that's all we roll.
And it's all we know, to reach inside ourselves to purge us of this private fucking hell.
It's time for us to step up, and stand all.
So let the blood, let the blood run through the streets.
We're all one voice and our voice is strong.
There's so many of us that we can't be wrong.
We're gonna give it all, try to hold on tight.
They've got to give it up cause they know we're too fucking right.
Cause that's all we roll.
And it's all we know, to look out for each other just like our sisters and brothers.
Stand all, stick together, be strong, and let the blood, let the blood run through the streets.
