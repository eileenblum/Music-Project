When freedom fell from the skies,
we were torn between the lies.
The pretext for war was the wrath
of men no longer wise.
But to grasp this inside,
foreknowledge holds the key
to unlock the truth.
The truth shall set you free.

Impeach, Indict, Imprison
I bet so few would object
So rip off their fucking heads
and shit down their fucking necks

This evil cabal is insane,
yet still we play their game.
A mission accomplished for some,
with thousands killed or maimed.
When all systems failed, they failed and failed again.
Contain and control by means so inhuman.

Impeach, Indict, Imprison,
beyond reasonable doubt.
They're guilty as fucking sin
for selling us fucking out!
