So did you think it would ever come to this in this day and age?
That our worst Orwellian nightmare cometh,
but don't start running....express your rage
that the constitution was maimed by the fourth fucking Reich
Oh... that comfort zone you protect must keep you in denial
that the end's in sight
So show your hate! Push it to the brink!
It's time to get the fuck up and show the world what you think!

And I endure more war like the sacrificial lamb that I am
Peak oil and globalization are coming,
but are we doing the best we can
to get the truth? Yeah, the mother fucking truth!
Cause we the people are sick
and really fucking tired of the likes of you

So show your hate, while I get your back
Our red, white, blue, is turning to red, white, black.

So show your hate! Show your fucking hate!
The worst part of the nightmare's coming,
so don't start running cause now's the time
to show your hate, and push it to the brink!
It's time to get the fuck up and show the world what you think!
