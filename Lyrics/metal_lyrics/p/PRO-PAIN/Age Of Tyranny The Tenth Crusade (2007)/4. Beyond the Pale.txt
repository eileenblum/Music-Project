With the strength of mystical force,
they enforce the wars of the cross,
and were sent by Jesus and God
to win whatever the cost.
But "the price of freedom is high"
said those who sold this charade,
and we chose to go and partake,
and so began the crusade.

With martyrs on all sides
instructing all to rise,
and fight the factions of evil,
they took us on all rides
as we watched the carnage and death
spiral out of control.
Then we all went on with our lives,
'til all took a toll

Freedom... Beyond The Pale

Now the case for war we reject,
but we're forced to accept
and trust in those we elect
with policies so inept.
Blind drunk with power and rage,
their propaganda was staged,
but no one dare make a sound.
Blind to facts on the ground

These trails of violence and tears
will be like this for years.
Most are numb to the pain
and ignorant to the game.
But a game was played nonetheless
that some would call a success,
with occupation the goal.
Stripping the soul.

Freedom... Beyond The Pale
