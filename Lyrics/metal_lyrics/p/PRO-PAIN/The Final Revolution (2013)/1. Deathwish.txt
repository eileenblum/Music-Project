If I could drive a stake right through your heart, I'd watch your light give way to dark. This soul assassin has once before graced a distant shore like a flashback of Vietnam. You've got a deathwish, that's why I penned this one. So, don't fuck with my fight or flight cause it's a flashÂ­back and it's Friday night. Alright! The fact is I alone possess the pride of many and I confess to having knowledge of big secrets which haunt my life. Deep inside the mind, it's a flashback!
