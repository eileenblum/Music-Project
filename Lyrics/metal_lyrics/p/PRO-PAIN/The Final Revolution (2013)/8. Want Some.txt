Can you see the hate and pain in my eyes? The way they seem to cut through you. The wrath of a billion tortured souls will come crashing down through this godforsaken place called earth and leave a void so well deserved. In this life you get what you give, so listen up! For if you want some, you better come quick and come clean before reality hits you like a brick. I don't give a fuck what was said. I'll listen to the voices in my head before I take note of what you say on this particular shitty day. Division has reached a feverish pitch and in the end we won't be missed. Consider it a blessing that god sent this great gift. For if you want some, you better come quick and come clean before reality hits you like a brick. For if you want some, get some!
