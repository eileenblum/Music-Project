The pain strikes back in so many ways that you can lose track of the hurt. For money ain't no object to us. Heads up, cause we're on alert! We lead the way like a Judas goat down a path of complete destruction and hate and infamy. We are the voice of a generation and that's ok 'cause that's our way! Yeah, that's ok, cause that's our way! Yet the vulgar many try in vain, but the truth is, they can't stop the pain! Sometimes I feel like a slave to all of this and like I've done my time But then the power of unforeseen forces lifts me up to new heights, and like a sovereign nation, I defend my right to exist. So give your undivided attention, scream loud and raise your fist because today who can you trust? What's good for them ain't good for us!
