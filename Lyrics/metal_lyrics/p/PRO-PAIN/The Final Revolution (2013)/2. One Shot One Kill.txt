I'm pensive and nervous, and I'm generally under duress. Seems you caught me at a bad time, cause I'm just a fuckin' mess. No time to play the victim, no broader worries other than death, because a dark heart and a bright mind are the keys to success. Despite the broken dreams, in bits and pieces, I'm fairing well as far as I can tell. This time, I swear I'll give this all that I got. Sometimes in life that's all you get is one shot (one kill). I take a sip of the good stuff and I really really try to relax, but my mind keeps slippin' away as if perpetually under attack. No sleep for the wicked they say, or is it rest? Same thing I suppose, but who gives a fuck anyway! I'd rather off myself than merely exist, and I'll go quickly if you get my gist. This time I swear I'll give this all that I got. Sometimes in life that's all you get is one shot (one kill). One shot, one kill.
