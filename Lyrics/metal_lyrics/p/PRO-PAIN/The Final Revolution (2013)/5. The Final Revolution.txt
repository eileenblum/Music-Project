History repeats itself to spite our ignorance. No hope for tomorrow and there is no second chance. Sign up, line up for the next big confrontation. It promises to be the best thing for this nation. Oh, the sacrifices mode in the name of Cod and son on uninviting shores where wars were won. It's the final revolution, taking hold! It's the final revolution, god save our souls! Let's we forget that all gave some and some gave all to build this house of flesh and bones. Now watch it fall! In peril, the world shakes and braces itself for the end. With no regard for life, we're doomed to fail again. So the war was waged within. On familiar soil and then unfriendly fire rained down on us. The game begins!
