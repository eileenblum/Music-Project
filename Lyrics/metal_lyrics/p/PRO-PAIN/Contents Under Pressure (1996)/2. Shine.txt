Burn the bridge
And severe all ties to the right
Kiss the kids
Cause daddy's gone off to fight
Brace yourself
For the search and seizure of the land
We'll spread the wealth
And finally gain the upper hand
In death and taxes
God we trust
E.Pluribus unum shine
I rust
Hang 'em high
And don't cut em' down till you're told
We're justified
In taking back what they stole
Mad as hell
We desecrate in disgrace
Dry, the well
You kick the dirt in my face
In death and taxes
God we trust
E.Pluribus unum shine
I rust
