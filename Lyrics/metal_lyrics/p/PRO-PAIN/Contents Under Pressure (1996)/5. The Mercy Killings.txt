The people shouted no justice and no peace
It's getting pretty wicked and wild in the streets
We're frightened of the gunshots in the park
Praying that our kids come home before dark
Screaming sirens cuss the air
They're killing our kids and they don't care
It makes you wanna hang your head and cry
It makes you feel powerless inside
Took the tech 9
To the head
It was a mercy kill
And there were five found dead
Violence nine to five
I can't really say that it's great to be alive
I'm talking about the bloodshed overflow
It's moving too fast for the folks below
When reality rears it's head
Hope is lost as tears are shed
We fall prey to violence crime
Been sittin' ducks for all our lives
