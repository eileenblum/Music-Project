This court is in session
So stand erect
The case persecution
Of generation X
A taste of pollution
To make you choke
En masse execution
Behind the smoke
Discarded and thrown by the wayside
Endorse this punishable act
Blame us if we are what you made us
Die slowly but leave us intact
They buried the treasure
And burned the map
They cut down the trees
And drank the sap
The earth is a prison
With no where to go
Contents under pressure
It's bound to blow
