Well it's 6 am at the white house
And the sun's just about to break
Gonna go for a run with the C.I.A
And talk shop with my boys in Kuwait
We got ethnic cleansing in Bosnia
While the Haitian's come in by boat
I think it's time for some media posturing
To put the spark right back in your vote
I reserve the right
To lie straight up in your face
I'll squeal in delight
And leave you in disgrace
I will not step down
Hurt my pride
I shalt thou commit
Political suicide
Got a real nice disposition
More perks then a chock full o'nuts
But I can't stand up to the congress
Cause I just don't have the guts
My hands are ties domestically
I gotta brown nose the N.R.A.
Those campaign contributions
Have put me where I am today
