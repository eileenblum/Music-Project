Hate is like a fire
Burning in my head
You are my desire
As I desire you dead
Please don't ask me questions
Because I can only lie
And the hunt will never end
As long, as long as my love
My love, you can hide

Gather round kids, gather all round the campfire
As I hunt you down in the night like a vampire
So the story goes - the fire burns to the black
And god only knows if you're ever coming back

Oh, I can feel your presence
Breathing in my air
In the midst of nervous laughter
I can sense that you're aware
Somewhere in these clouded thoughts
There lies a peaceful man
And you are all I seek
Until I find you
I will swear to walk the land
