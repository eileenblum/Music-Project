He wakes up early to watch regis at nine
His summer clothes are of the finest design
His ethnic maid will serve him breakfast in bed
He likes to travel but lives at club med

I've got:
Pain and problems on my mind
You see I'm wasting time
I've past my prime
Take these eyes and leave me blind
See the world unwind
Life isn't kind - can you picture this?

He's got six cars and had seven wives
Who shared the greed with him all of their lives
Life is a peach but sometimes it's the pits
While on top of cash mountain he sits
