Enter the zone - our mission: Achieving the goal
We act alone - for reasons beyond our control
Under the gun - our power of reason prevails
Second to none - in whatever the mission entails

We're fighting a war
For truth and never more
The need to understand
So do what you can and you will

Open your mind - for we are the yet to be seen
Leave this behind for longing to say what you mean
Death and despair of endless relentless decay
Buyer beware - our choice is to live for today

We're fighting a war
For truth and never more
The need to understand
So do what you can and you will
Make some fucking noise
