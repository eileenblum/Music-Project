Forced into black - and this is all we know
Acquired taste to kill ourselves
For demon seeds to grow
Accept the fact - we're not the same
No right or wrong in casting blame
Incarcerate society for what is harsh reality

So what have we become?
Corrupt the only son
We search for reasons why
Until the day we die

No love, all lust, no truth or trust
What if your eyes desentisize?

Bypass the norm - and let the games begin
We'll take the world by storm
From the outside looking in

Obsessed with death - we grow old
Our callousness is twice as cold
We compensate morality to exercise authority

In time we'll see the light
For now no ends in sight
We need to make it clear
The reasons why we're here
