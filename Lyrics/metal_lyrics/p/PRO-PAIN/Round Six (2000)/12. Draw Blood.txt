Draw blood for the kids who know no war
Fly high - god will let your eagle soar
Shed tears on the path in which you pave
Have faith and sacred vigilance will guard your grave

Gotta take good care for those
Who have taken care of us
There is life beyond our woes
So sacrifice we must

To love to hate - for twist of fate
A loss to gain - to die in vain
Draw blood

Stand guard - we defend with all our might
Pray god give strength to to what's right
Cast doubt on a way in which you live
I say we gave enough, there's nothing left to give

And the world becomes undone
When all the wars are won
Paid a price for liberty
Knowing nothing is for free

To love to hate - for twist of fate
A loss to gain - to die in vain
Draw blood
