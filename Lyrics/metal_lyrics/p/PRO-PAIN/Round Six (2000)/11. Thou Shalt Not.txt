Despite all the pain that we've been through, my friend
We search for a sign to guide us till the end
Believe in yourself - Do what you think is right
May your kids be safe and warm into the night
The blood, the sweat, the anger and the tears
Represent all our acts of faith throughout the years
Deceit is a means in which to measure gain
Never take the name of Lord Thy God in vain

From this day on - for keeps we play vain

We lost ourselves along the way
We sow our seeds and watch them grow
Content that god will never know

And thou shalt not...

Behold - the meaningless we must protect
The tell tale signs are there in full effect
Embrace the unknown as if it was your own
May the sun shine bright in times when you're alone
Remind us before the day that we're to go
To share our thoughts with those who care to know
We must give praise when goodness is deserved

And now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

And thou shalt not...
