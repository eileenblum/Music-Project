On our quest for liberty
Can we live as one?
Got stuck here in survival mode
And the worst is yet to come
We passed the point of no return
As we watched the world go mad
If you've only got yourselves to blame
Well, that's too fuckin' bad

Kill time all day
At best you're wasting away
Breakdown defense
Lash out and break some fuckin' sense

Cause life ain't what you're worth
It's what you are

Ignorance is plain to see
And that they can't deny
They'll end us all eternally
Now it's a case of Do or Die
We pray they seek forgiveness
For the pain they put us through
No need to clear the conscience
They put the blame on you

A life to take
The choice is yours to make
What now? Let live
You took enough, now fucking give!
