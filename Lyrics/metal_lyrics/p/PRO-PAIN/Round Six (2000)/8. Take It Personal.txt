I take to violence to break the silence of the mind
Well I don't really care for you and you know I hate your kind
Assassination per demonstration of the rage
This pissed off individual has recently come of age

You wasted all my time - when time was on my side
Life left to leave you blind my eyes are open wide
Don't stop to wish me well - yes I will have my day
My thoughts are "It's been hell" - now I'll be on my way

Take it personal

Mass destruction complete combustion of the soul
I'll make sure you eat your words and insist you swallow whole
An Alternation in all relation to the past
The consequence is: Most of us die young for living fast

I'd walk a thousand miles - just to do this all again
And revel all the while - with the few that I call friend
If I could change my ways - in the only way I know
I'd set the world ablaze - and call it even, so...

Take it personal
