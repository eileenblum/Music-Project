Deep in the minds of us all is a need or a call
To adjust and release
You bury the past and you know it will last
But it kills you just like a disease
Cope with the pain just to drive you insane
As you think of an easy way out
But you stop to a drink and you think to youself

"And so this is what life is about?"

Oh, help is on it's way
Got the power to pull you through
Gonna take a big commitment, boy
When it's puttin' the hurt on you
Got the strength to lift you up
And get your feet back on that ground
Only you gotta save yourself
Cause they're lookin' to shoot you down

Stuck in a daze like a rat in the maze
And they don't give a fuck how you feel
Misunderstood but you did what you could
Now you're falling asleep at the wheel
Death has begun, so you turn and you run
And you give it your best but you fall
So you live for the day with a will and a way
But you're caught with your back to the wall

Oh, help is on it's way
Got the power to pull you through
Gonna take a big commitment, boy
When it's puttin' the hurt on you
Got the strength to lift you up
And get your feet back on that ground
Only you gotta save yourself
Cause they're lookin' to shoot you down

In flames!!!
