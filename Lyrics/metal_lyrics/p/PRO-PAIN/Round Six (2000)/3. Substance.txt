Beyond recognition - We'll survive
Cause were down with the people
And that keeps us alive
It's mind over matter - and the beat goes on
Respect one another for now and when I'm gone

No need to deceive - we'd rather be real
You needn't believe us if that's how you feel
I've given the best of the realist in me
In waiting for something or someone to see
What we're made of

False premonition to cast a doubt
But there's always something
That we should live without
A shock to the system - cross the line
State your opinions and open up the mind

You're wasting away - year afer year
No promise to take time to notice you're here
A subtle persistence and time is the key
In waiting for something or someone to see
What we're made of
