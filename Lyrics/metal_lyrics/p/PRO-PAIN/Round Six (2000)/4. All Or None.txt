Died beneath the red white and blue
All just because you did what they told you to do
Tried to buy a mind of your own
The system failed - for lack of interest in you
Countless episodes in violence took a toll
They kept the pawns at bay
Whith reckless abandonment they met their goals
Few tried to stand in their way

When peace defied the nation
They snuffed all need to know
Damned this generation
And fucked us - way to go!
Played us like a man
Who's qork is never done
Their wish is our command
And all they want is ALL OR NONE

Succumbed to laws of death but such is life
Sometimes you're bait - they bite
You tried to cut the tension with a knife
All efforts ain't worth shit
Painful proposition - take - do not refuse
A face to place the blame
I guess sometimes you win - sometimes you lose
It's how you play the game

Thoughtless revelations
Got no place to go
Mindless aspirations
Spoiled no seed to grow
The promise in the land
We'll reap if we are one
And now the time's at hand
And all we want is ALL OR NONE
