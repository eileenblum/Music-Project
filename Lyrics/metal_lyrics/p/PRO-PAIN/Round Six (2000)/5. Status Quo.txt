Hands are tied - the scene is set
To take advantage of the meek
As sacrificial lambs are killed
The blood will run into the street
Mass migration - exodus
All lemmings forced into the sea
It's a masochistic attitude
But better you than fuckin' me

It's a fool's paradise
Who'll pay the price?
It's not for you and me to decide
Why piss and moan?
You're not alone
Stay shallow and swallow your pride
Hearts fill with rage
This day and age
Cry freedom and fight to be free
They can't deny my reason
I don't believe in the powers that be

Speak your peace and fill the void
Then let your will decide your fate
Spark a violent overthrow
And undermine the church and state
Break the silence - seize the day
The gut reaction is to kill
Fuck the system - seek the truth
For the cause I know you will
