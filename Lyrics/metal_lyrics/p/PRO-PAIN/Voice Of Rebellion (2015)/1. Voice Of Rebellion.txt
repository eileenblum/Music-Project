Die, fucker!
I bet you'd like a little pain with your pleasure
For we measure up like a beast
We go a long way to love you all for the minute, then leave you deceased
For such a thankless endeavor we gave all ourselves, and now we've absolutely nothing to show for it but some pride on the shelves
Our voice of rebellion falls on deaf ears with no heroes to be found, but only pestilence
Black smoke, no tears as end grows near, dust clears and I'll appear

So consider this a warning shot, mother fucker!
Consider this a warning shot

I bet you think you've seen it all but you didn't, no, not even close
Don't you think a little credit's due to those who gave up the most spread of the world?
Let the knowledge in and crack open the mind

To those who deceived us, fuck you and your kind!
Our voice of rebellion, drowned out by fear
On heads we shall roll
Spit venom, let the chips fall where they may
What they made embrace your fate, succumb to my hate in these words
I will be heard!

So consider this a warning shot, mother fucker!
So consider this a warning shot, fucker!
Our voice of rebellion falls on deaf ears with no heroes to be found, but only pestilence
Black smoke, no tears as end grows near, dust clears and I'll appear

So consider this a warning shot, mother fucker!
Consider this a warning shot, fucker!
Consider this a warning shot, mother fucker!
Consider this a warning shot
Consider this a warning shot, mother fucker!
Consider this a warning shot
Just consider this a warning shot, mother fucker!
Consider this a warning shot
Die, fucker!
