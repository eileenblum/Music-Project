The bad blood blood is dripping  Down the wall
Your sneakers are slipping  Do break your fall
You thought it was a game  Till Johnny got his gun
The talons got your name  I think you'd better run

My time, my work, your prize, you jerk
realize, i despise, you and yours and you me
BAD BLOOD BAD BLOOD BAD BLOOD BAD BLOOD

The bad blood is boiling on the floor
You can't stop the anger cause this means war
Surrender your conscience, and do your time
I will not forgive you for wasting mine
Bad Blood
