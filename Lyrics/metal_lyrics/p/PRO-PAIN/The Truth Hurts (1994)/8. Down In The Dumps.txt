Angry on the outside angry on the in
Disgruntled with the thing I see
Looking for a future that lies in your hands
Is such a bad place to be
Educated hippies and psychedelic yups
Really gets my Irish up
I am just a beggar, begging for some money
Spare some change to fill my cup

It's not so bad, I'm happy like a pig in shit
Unlike some puppet of a sult and tie chump
When anybody wants something from me
That's where I'll be - Face down in the dumps

Mercilessly seeking pleasure in my pain
The wages set do not increase
Can't afford the rent, I'm tossed out in the rain
I lost my life and lost my lease
Hard times are coming up around the bend
It's been that kind of year
My battle with the bottle, is back with a bang
I need a drink, so where is my beer

It's not so bad, I'm happy like a pig in shit
Unlike some puppet of a sult and tie chump
When anybody wants something from me
That's where I'll be - Face down
