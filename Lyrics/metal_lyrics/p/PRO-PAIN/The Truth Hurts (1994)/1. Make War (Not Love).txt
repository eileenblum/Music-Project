I'm an open wound
I can feel lt In my gut
I lie face down In my excrement and try to belly up
Unilke a fish I can't swim against the tide
So i keep my head above water and try to thumb a ride

Yet only the strong survive and the weak shall fall
The rest will pray to the likes of a concrete wall
Destroy the role that fits like a hand in glove
AND MAKE WAR NOT LOVE

lf i were a broken back and you were a brace
would you let me lay down and die here or put me back in place
Like the lamb, too submissive and nice
you were easy prey for the wolf pack who made you pay the price

Yet only the strong survive and the weak shall fall
the rest will pray to the likes of a concrete wall
destroy the role that fits like a hand in glove
and make war not love
