Born in '65 A bouncing baby boy
A million dollar smile A brand new box of toys
Every mothers dream An innocent child to hold
Untarnished by humanity bright naive yet bold

School came he tearned the meaning of joy, pain,
misfortune and gain He'd ask questions about sex and life
like - why is daddy messing with his ex-wife?

Inner child's in denial Inner child's in denial
Inner child's in denial Inner child's in denial

Peer pressure took Control of his life one day
What good he a left in his heart was stripped away
His parents got divorced left him out in the corld
Funny how we get so bitter as we grow old

The boy cried his girl by his side
She's bold and bright, naive, uptight
someday he'd like to tie the knot
But the inner self remembers all that time forgot
