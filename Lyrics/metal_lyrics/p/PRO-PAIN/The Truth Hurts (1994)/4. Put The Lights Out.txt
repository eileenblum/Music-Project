Bout time you showed up
I was just about to count you out for giving up
When we were young we talked about the same things
Lyrically redundant, mentally stimulating
We sure knew how to ride a crowd
The cops showed up because the music was loud,
but that's what being sixteen was all about
Step into the ring and swing and put the lights out

Six hundred rushed the stage
The crowd in a frenzy the band in a rage
Kick a little homage just for the old times
To spread the gospel and bust out a new rhyme
Gotta wonder what's next for the encore
Maybe some hip hop maybe something hardcore
Toughen up enough to throw your body out
Everbody move and put the lights out

Whe reap the pros in pain
A shock for the body and food for the brain
Power to the people who shook the cage
Read the fine print and turned the page
I'll make you ponder the thought succes
Could be a quality you possess
Get off your ass, don't be a burnout
Step into the thick of things and
Put the lights out
