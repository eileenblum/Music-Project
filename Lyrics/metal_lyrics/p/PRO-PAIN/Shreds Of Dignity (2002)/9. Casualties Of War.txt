War and pain fall down like rain
Morbid thoughts enter my brain
Time to kill - thousands I will
Goals to reach - trenches to fill
The world will be no more
The casualties of war

Blood is shed - millions are dead
Sounds of death rip through my head
Minds i rape - chances I take
Bones I break - choices I make
The world will be no more
The casualties of war

You chose to talk the talk
I'm known to walk the walk
You dared to cross my path
And now you'll feel my wrath
