Drown us in sorrow
Feed us more lies
Wake me up tomorrow
Strap me up to the nines

Senseless reason
Nervous twitchin'
Tis the season
Let's go fishin'

Acts of defiance done to you by me
Suffering in silence as far as eyes can see

No death 'til dawn
I awaken
All are forwarned
Last breaths taken
Break it down
