Took to the city - the band were late
We could care less cause we can't wait
Got fucked up and so were they
Man they sucked - but that's OK

They do it all for the money
Got lots to show
Keep the cash flow comin'
Who needs to know
It's all right
It's OK
Play, fleece and walk away

Same old shit yet another town
torn inside out and upside down
The ones you got to know so well
Got much to learn but more to tell

They did it all for the money
And not for the show
To keep the side show runnin'
Just pack some things and go
It's all right
It's OK
Play, fleece and walk away
