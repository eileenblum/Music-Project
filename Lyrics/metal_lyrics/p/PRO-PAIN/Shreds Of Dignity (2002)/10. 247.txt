Man I feel like shit today
I gotta make it all go away
Take your bullshit outta my face
Before I wreck this whole damn place
So leave my home and me alone
Boy I hate this fucking scene
And I know you know what I fucking mean
You crucify me all day long
And tell me how you're right and I'm wrong
To make you feel complete - so real
Well I've been around and I'm well aware
So don't you think I don't fucking care
I live my life the best I can
Gonna put you on the five year plan
So leave my home and me alone
