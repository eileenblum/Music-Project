Arrogance is all around us
How can we relax?
All our friends and foes surround us to stab us in the backs
Your minds and worlds we'll rock to take us to the dusty road
But now's the time we lock and load

False compassion makes me sick
Determination makes us tick
Like a bomb that's sent to blow you a kiss from G.I. Joe
Throw brad and the geese will flock where hearts and mines explode
The perfect place to lock and load
