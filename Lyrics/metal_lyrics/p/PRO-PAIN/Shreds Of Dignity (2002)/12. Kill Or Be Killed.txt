These times are changin' so you keep up or fuckin' die cause war is contagious
Gotta tell us the truth, don't fuckin' lie
As our foes surround us the system stabs us in the back
No help to help us defend in case of an attack
Yet the beast within shall rise from sea to shining sea
It's a call for their demise by hate - eternally
It's kill or be killed

So who can be trusted if we're represented by the past?
All options exhausted
Conclusions jumped too far too fast
What's to save us if religion sowed the seeds of war
God forgave us for the past atrocities ignored
Now the evil one shall die but who the fuck are they?
No need to question why we're bitter to this day
It's kill or be killed
