I cried a thousand times for those who lost their lives up in NYC
Friends underneath remains from such a dirty game
Looks like world war 3
Picking up the pieces while we try to make some sense of it all - can we?
Dont't you try to underscore the nature of it all with your sympathy

I'm down for the cause
The cause is down for me and I'll fight 'til the last breath for life and
liberty
Blood upon your hands will run but never fade and restless you lie awake in the
bed you made
I'm down for the cause
You and all of those like you have cut this place in two to divide and conquer
We - blind to those who hate can hope it's not too late

So complacent we are
Can't understand the past
The peace was not to last for to each his own
play biblical charades with military aides in the danger zone
