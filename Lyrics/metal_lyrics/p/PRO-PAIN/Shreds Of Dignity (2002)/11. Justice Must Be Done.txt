Let the scales of justice fall to the ground
Search for place to worship - none found
Let the nation seal our fate
And seek to build their welfare state
So pinch yourself if you don't believe your eyes
They beat you down with a system they've devised
Shut you up and cut you down to size
And all that will remain will fucking die
Drain the seas of good intent
Justify our time they spent
Lax beyond our wildest dream
Fall beneath the cracks and seams
Spin yourseld a vicious circle
In which you can protect and house your kin
No collective thoughts of where you've been
Utilize your strength from within
Justice must be done
Breaking your will with callous decree for what you believe
Pleasure to kill those who betray and those who deceive
What can be said? What can be done? What should we do?
Justice for me would be an injustice to you
Justice must be done right now
