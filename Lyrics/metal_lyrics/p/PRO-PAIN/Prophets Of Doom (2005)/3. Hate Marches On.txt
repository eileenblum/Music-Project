Hate is on the march
Hence the kiss of death
A few will get out alive to take another breath
Freedom is on the rise in businesses all around
The public kept unaware and told to "hunker down"
Unanswered questions like how, when and why?
No accusations confirmed or denied
Left opposition laid down and played dead
Millions left speeches, scratching their heads
Genocide, homicide, legacy of a cold and a sick society
Put your balls to the test and bring it on
Better fight to the death
Hate marches on
Exit due process feelin' fuckin betrayed
I've never been known to partake in charades
Worshippers on the edge
Prayin for better days
I'm just a sucker for Jesus because I heard he saves
A gut wrenching process to bury one's own
Anxious and nervous you'll sit by the phone
Xerox condolences sent to you all from Rummy and George, Condi and Paul
Consider this and take a stand to make amends
It's not a place for your intolerance
Why do we feel the need to carry on this way
It's not OK!!
Hate marches on!
