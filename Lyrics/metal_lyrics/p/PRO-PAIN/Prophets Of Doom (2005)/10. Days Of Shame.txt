Over the sands, we will roll
Blood onn our hands and our souls
Filthy ideals fed to us those who play god
In god we trust?
This is insane
We were wrong
These days of shame last so long
I've taken on this position cause that's where I stand
Abort the deadly mission and meet our demands
Inhabitants beware of the fascist regime
Denounce the tales of torture, absurd and obscene
Pure deception, sleight of hand, spread dementia across the land
Information overload
Infiltrate the status quo
Don't speak for me or stain my name on these disgraceful days of shame
Your wordliest possessions are now worth a shit
Economical warfare, all world markets hit 100000 dead and billions are spent
Inauguration - all threats and messages sent
From the ashes we will rise to wipe this nightmare from our eyes
Our fear is most contagious, our ignorance bliss
A lethal show of force - but the force is remiss
All based on false perception to misplace the blame
No place to hand our heads in these days of shame, in these days of shame...
