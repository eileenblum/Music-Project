Torn and ripped apart at the seams
I guess I took too much for the team
Had a knack for keepin the score
But I can't put my thoughts into words anymore
I never reaped rewards from the masses
I stood tall and beat some asses
Accolades were far and few
I did it all not for me, but for you, and I'm torn!
Torn to pieces with every turn
I'm torn to pieces
Torn and lost in the game
It's like being left in the rain
Guess it's best to know when to quit
Well now you know that this could be it
Faceless in a redundant scene for dead ears and for silent screams
Where the cream don't rise to the top and too much talkin shit/talking shop
And I'm torn
Torn to pieces with every turn
I'm torn to pieces
