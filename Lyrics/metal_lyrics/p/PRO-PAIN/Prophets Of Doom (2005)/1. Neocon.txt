The war on terror
No truth, all lies
Awaken the masses
Open your eyes
Yeah!!
Kill, rape, torture, pillage, as time marches on
A vicious agenda de force
Neocon
Prize in sight, so we fight, and we pray that the kids are alright that we sent off to die
Letters sent from the base tell the tale that we face everyday but we tend to deny
That the cause is unjust so we must pray to god for the wrath is his will, so we kill
Branded weak are the sheep with no minds of their own
So they do what they're told, and they will
Thou shalt not fight for you!!!
US Uber Alles except for itself
A country divided by fascists and wealth
Begging for mercy, the truth never told
Families are broken, bodies are cold
Deaf, blind, all sides getting took for a ride
Being fed steady diets of grey
Death starved, so we dine up with a chill up the spine
As we drink it and wish it away
Such a price to endure all the theater of death has to give in the place where we live
Play god for the term play it well
Never learn, never will we forget or forgive
Thou shalt not kill for you!!
Bring it on!
Thou shalt not die for you!! Bring it on Neocon!!
