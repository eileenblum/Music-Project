Break down the four walls forever
Time's up, set me free
I'll do what I want to whenever
Pissin off the powers that be
Led a life of death and destruction
Bet you'd like to see me die
A big nabd without interruption
Blood lust is satisfied
So what's the meaning of life?
And what do you suggest that I do with mine?
I'd like to get the whole world off of my chest
What's that look in your eyes?
I can tell when thing's ain't straight
Another voice inside me dies replaced with another fueled by hate and I hate all your lies
Look me straight in my eyes
I've done my time
Melt away the bars from this cell
It kinda makes you hard and cold
Life sucks in this private hell
It's not a place for you to grow old
This just a taste of tomorrow with the same ol' shit each day
Gotta lie, cheat, steal, or borrow
It's the good old fashioned way
So what the fuck do you want?
What the fuck do you need?
An invitation to hell on earth has been sent to you with a VIP
But like a dog on a leash, restrained from a vicious attack
I'll try to fuck you twice as hard as you plunge a grudge knife in my back
And I hate all your lies
Look me straight in my eyes
I've done my time
