I foresee the way it's gotta be
my intentions are to serve you wrong
I tried to find strength and piece of mind
when you put me to the test, but not for long

Pressure. It's always on
Sometimes you gotta take the ball and run
Power. It's all in my hands
but what will I do with the still smokin' gun

Feed my need to build a house of greed
Intentions seem to prove correct
The policy is simple the Plans all good
to rid you of your self respect

Pressure. It's always on
Sometimes you gotta take the ball and run
Power. It's all in my hands
but what will I do with the still smokin' gun
