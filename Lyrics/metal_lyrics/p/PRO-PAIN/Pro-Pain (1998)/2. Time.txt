It's Suddenly September
I like to listen to the rain come down
I was never very good company
You were the loneliest game in town
Lots of painful memories
all stored up in my head
like the day you chose the high road
and I took the low instead
Disappointment slowly turned to rage,
I guess it's the point I missed
When blood starts boiling all the world a stage
For some it's more than this
"So open up you heart and raise the son"
"God knows how long you'll be on this earth"
"Follow all the footsteps in the sand"
"Promise me you'll do the best you can"
You can't Turn Back.
I'm staring out my window
watching all the clouds go by
It's starting to look like winter
and it's getting kind of cold inside
I guess when all is said and done
I've gotta bow out gracefully
If time can make the seasons change
It's bound to make a change on me
Desperation rears it's ugly head
Give me the will to fight
Indecision Make the Final Call
Do you know whats right?
"So open up you heart and raise the son"
"God knows how long you'll be on this earth"
"Follow all the footsteps in the sand"
"Promise me you'll do the best you can"
You can't Turn Back.-time
