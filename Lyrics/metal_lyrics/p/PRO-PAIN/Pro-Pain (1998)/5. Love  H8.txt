Subculture in our public schools
Got real drunk and acted cool
Taught me how to hate myself
So fuck you and everyone else

In retrospect the wasted time brings me down
Thoughts of revolution follow me around
Everywhere I got it bugs me to this day
That most of us are causing all this pain
Yes,some I love, but most I hate

Strain the bullshit from my brain
Enough to make you go insane
Independence is extinct
SO try no to swim while we sink

Fortunately now I'm skeptical and wise
You can blow your smoke, I'll read between the lines
Everywhere I go it bugs me to this day
that most of us are causing all this pain
Yes,some I love, but most I hate
