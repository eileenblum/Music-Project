Welcome to my world
you better buckle up
A sudden change in atmosphere
is never quite enough
So I'll unpack you bags
sit down,relax, settle in
You just make yourself at home
and ask me where I've been

I've been all around, this fucking town
The people will constantly bring you down
and they'll carry on about what they've heard
You will see Mark MY WORDS

Disconnect yourself
from all that you love
we have lots of bogus shit
to fit you like a glove
the many promises they made they lied
They'll never cease to burn you up, inside
