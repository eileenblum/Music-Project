I've payed the fool before
it burned me to the core
I put my pride on the shelf
Lots of broken hearts to repair
So I learned to confide in myself
No rhyme, no reason, no place to hide
to try and escape the pain inside

NO LOVE LOST.

Back in the day when we were so persistent
we would do anything for a shot
Pride ourselves alone on being different
we'd give everything that we got

Its been so long
my so called friend
In fair weather we will meet again

NO LOVE LOST.
