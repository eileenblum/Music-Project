Life's a game the way you play me like I'm some kinda jerk
You'll writhe in pain when I rock your mind till it hurts
Approach with caution best beware
Don't believe me, cause I don't care
I'm the greatest deceiver and you will see
that I'm godsize and I'll always be
Feel the blow when I pummet your head like a freak
Now you know its gonna take a toll on the weak
So tell me something I don't know
but you better think quick cause I ain't slow
Better bet your lifetime guarantee
that I'm godsize and I'll always be
Thoughts of warfare cross the mind choose your weapon, run
Hear the junter at your back fall to pieces, done
Death defying, hard to kill
Hence the "demon seed"
Take you down, snaps your neck, satisfies thy need
