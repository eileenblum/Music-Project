These eyes of destruction focus on you
welcome to war I wage
Relentlessly vicious, nothing to prove,
can you feel my rage?
Alone in the darkness, eager to kill,
I can't stand the sight of the sun
Those who have wished for my time to run out
you'd best tae your three steps and run
cause My Time Will Come

With mass calculations, strategic as hell
time marches on to the death
No circulation no source of vent
I can catch your breath
Patiently waiting I count down the days
and nervously try to stay calm
Fear is my weapon and I use it well
I won't retreat till I'm done
cause My Time Will Come
