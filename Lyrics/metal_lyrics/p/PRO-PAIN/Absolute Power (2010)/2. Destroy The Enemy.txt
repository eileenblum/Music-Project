Destroy your enemy, and do it well
I'm full of anger, boy can't you tell?
The bets we made are off, and things are bloody
The shit hit the fan (sniff sniff) - the future muddy
Death and destruction - all of them passed the buck
They can blame me and shame me, see if I give a fuck
I don't and I won't and I... well that's why I lead
And you walk ten steps behind me
All we need is another victim of society
A billion people who say "why me?"
Populations of policy
Tightly bound via prophecy
I don't care and
I'll deploy from anywhere
To destroy the enemy
Destroy your enemy, but do it right
Keep both hands on the wheel
And eyes on the prize in sight
Pockets are empty like the poisoned minds
Of the chosen few who I chose to be left behind
The ones who stripped us all out of all we had are
Condemned to a cell in hell, and I'm fucking glad
There's strength in the masses, and it's boom or bust
There's shame in complacency, so are we just...
Another victim of society
