Blacken the sun
Wait for darkness to arrive
On deaths doorstep we sit
Some have sat there all their lives
In from the pouring rain
Right into the burning flames
Choke on the soot
From information withheld from the brain
Endless how spineless and lifeless we are
Helplessly hopeless and this is by far beyondgrasp and perception
We've chequered our past
Mindless the fools who think this will last
This is my decision...
When the world comes crashing down
I'll stand my ground
Into the pits
Of eternal lies and deceit
We hope to manage to survive
And take all matters to the street
Into the pouring rain
Hoping to tap one fucking vein
And crush underfoot all who resist
Of those who remain
Hate springs eternally
Lusting for war
The nameless and shameless will rot
To their core and beyond
Power, enslavement, by fascist regime
I've got the end if you've got the means
This was our decision
When the world comes crashing down
I'll stand my ground
This is my decision
When the world comes crashing down
I'll stand my ground
It's my decision...
