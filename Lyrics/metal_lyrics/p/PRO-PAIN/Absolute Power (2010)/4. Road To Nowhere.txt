War is hate and life is pain
In a world so evil
From the cradle to the grave
We're on a road to nowhere...
Going nowhere
With broken hearts and idle minds
We're wishing away
Our shattered realities
That left us in ruins
We've still no shame
Global atrocities
Bestowed upon us
Our god has spoken
But none took heed
So we punish the messenger
Now everything's broken
I've nothing to say
But for this they shall pay
Walk the plank
And fall to your death
The liars you trusted
Will piss on your head
We're on a road to nowhere...
Going nowhere
They tore us apart
Through balkanization
And cheap legislation
Now we're running away
Like fleeing slaves
From this global plantation
It's a petty place
And any race
Should feel disgraced
Pushing a pack of lies
With holes a mile wide
In front of our open eyes
I've nothing to say
But for this they shall pay!!!
