I woke up in a fucking mess
Reliving the nightmares I try to suppress
Oh... the blood runs dry in the desert heat
I got a lot of remorse but there's no retreat
Liars in chief
Had us all believe
Greatness was achieved
Send us some relief
Cause I only dream about coming home
Dying inside
Take me for a ride
Put your flag away
Swallow all your pride
I play for once to be left alone
We're gonna get you home
Gonna get you home
I make war like a war machine should
Beat down every mother fucker that I could
It don't matter much what's wrong or right
But what does is that the end's in sight
AWOL
