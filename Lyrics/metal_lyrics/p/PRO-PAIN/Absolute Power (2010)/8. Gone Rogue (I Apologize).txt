So, so here we are again
Right here, right now
It's just me and the best of friends
They say "love, love is all you need"
And I think that they're right
In these times for the lives we're leading
So I, I apologize
If I mean such nothing in your eyes
I, I've done rogue again
But I miss "that something" in the end
Now, now away we go
The time flies, the world dies
We've got our scars to show for it all
And yet we still believe in ourselves and our way
A life's work all in a day or so...
I, I lie awake
As my body aches
From the stance I take
I, I realize
That we must mean something
Before we die
