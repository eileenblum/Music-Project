Hate and fear is all around
No one's ever safe or sound
Threat levels up and down
Wonder how your money's spent?
Wall Street Government
You and I irrelevant
Lies are truth and green is the new red
Those vultures picked our pockets while we bled
I told you before that it's all the same
We're prisoners of war and pawns in the game
The chain won't come off until you break it
Never give in, and don't fucking take it!
I'll break these chains - I'm unrestrained
World's going downhill
Buckle up, if you will
You and I will pay the bill
Close your eyes, open wide
Shut you face, enjoy the ride to state assisted suicide
Oh... it don't take much to poison a generation
Disgusted, I abhor this abomination
Where nothing is sacred and nothing is free
Except for the psyops "as seen on TV"
Will we succumb, will the giant awaken?
How many times can we sit there and take it?
I'll break these chains - I'm unrestrained
Lies are truth and green is the new red
Those vultures picked our pockets while we bled
I told you before that it's all the same
We're prisoners of war and pawns in the game
The chain won't come off until you make it happen
So just... just fucking break it
Well I'm not gonnatake this anymore!
I'll break these chains - I'm unrestrained
If you've got the means, we've got the end
