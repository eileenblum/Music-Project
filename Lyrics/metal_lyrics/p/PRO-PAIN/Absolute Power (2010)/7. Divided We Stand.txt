Divided we stand
It's been decided, we'll fall
We've been committed to next to nothing
Nothing at all
Atrocities revealed
Our silence so unreal
As seeds of hatred are sown
For my own nations annihilation
It's times like these
That test our souls
And shatter our faith in religion
And crush all goals
Yet this is why we fight
Cause we believe we're right
I detest the sounds and the sights
Of my own nations annihilation
Under the burning sun
Nothing ever changes from where I sit
Be careful what you wish for, you might get it
Now the hammer's cocked and the fuse it lit
Boom! So fuck this shit!
Annihilation on my own nation
Revolt, revolt, revolt, revolt!
