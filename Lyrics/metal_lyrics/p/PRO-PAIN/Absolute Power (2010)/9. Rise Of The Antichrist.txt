High up upon that hill
Up above our land
Armed to the teeth
With wit and weapon in our hand
Got to resist, we know
To never relent although we better believe in
Ourselves enough to land the final blow
The demon seed was spawned
Spawned inside your head
And the seven seals were torn
Torn inside your head
The war's inside your head!
Rise of the Antichrist!
Usurper of the man
Claimant to the throne
By counterfeit
Legitimate forms of power overthrown
Into the fucking lion
Cage in the burning sun
We desperately cling to the false messiah
He's "the one"...
