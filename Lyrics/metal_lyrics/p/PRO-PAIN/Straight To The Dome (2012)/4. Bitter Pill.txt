So lets just get one thing straight.
I'm on this earth for me, not for you,
and I could give a fuck who you think you are,
and I could care less what you do.
I piss on your legacy.
It looks like some cheap fools gold to me,
and your entire being means even less
than that, so you best lay off me.

Because I'm free like the birds which will circle your corpse
and pick at your bones the scraps you left
only to chirp in disgust and rip out your epitaph.
Oh, fire in the sky take me home,
let me lie in my own free will when I take this bitter pill.

In the end we'll all look back in abhorrence.
The deck was stacked and forged against us so evil could prosper.
In our place we stood, forlorn.
Well, so much for legacy. We've lost this inhuman race.
We tripped and fell upon the crooked crosses
which lay neglected, strewn, and chipped, just to be free.

Like the birds which will circle your corpse
and pick at your bones the scraps you left
only to chirp in disgust and rip out your epitaph.
Oh, fire in the sky take me home,
let me lie in my own free will when I take this bitter pill.

Because we're free.

So lets just get one thing straight.
I'm on this earth for me, not for you,
and I could give a fuck who you think you are,
and I could care less what you do.
I piss on your legacy.
It looks like some cheap fools gold to me,
and your entire being means even less
than that, so you best lay off me.

Because I'm free like the birds which will circle your corpse
and pick at your bones the scraps you left
only to chirp in disgust and rip out your epitaph.
Life's such a bitter pill.
