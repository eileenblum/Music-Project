You're lookin' out for number one. Opportunistic fun is just a stone's throw away.
The golden opportunities have bitten you and bettered me through dignity and loyalty.
I'm over it, you're talkin' shit and ever so full of it, and I'm hatin' you for what you've done.
I'll open one door to this and count ten. You mother fuckin' sumbitch had better run!

One, ten! Oh, it sucks to be you.
Yeah, to me that's the downside result of lickin' so much ass.
So much for class, I guess it sucks to be you. How it sucks to be you.
That's why you fell to the wayside. I'll flip you off as I pass.
They say life's a gas, but boy, it sucks to be you!

Who said the grass was greener was greener than green itself for taking his free ride for granted.
The pressure is never on when sole existence runs on the blood sweat and tears of others.
You're ugliness personified, selfishness epitomized, a parasitic life defined.
So take the ball and run with it, expedient piece of shit.
Go find a new host to feed on, and on, and so on, now go on.

Oh, it sucks to be you.
Yeah, to me that's the downside result of lickin' so much ass.
So much for class, I guess it sucks to be you. How it sucks to be you.
That's why you fell to the wayside. I'll flip you off as I pass.
They say life's a gas, but boy, it sucks to be you!
Sucks to be you. Man, it sucks to be you.

Oh, it sucks to be you.
Yeah, to me that's the downside result of lickin' so much ass.
So much for class, I guess it sucks to be you. How it sucks to be you.
That's why you fell to the wayside. I'll flip you off as I pass.
They say life's a gas, but boy, it sucks to be you!
Sucks to be you.
Sucks to be you.
Sucks to be you.
