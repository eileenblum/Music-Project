Oh, it seems like forever since the day.
This dark cold feeling just wont go away.
Sides were taken which divided us all.
Such ignorant people, shame on you all!
Pray for this and you pray for that
while you pimp your atrocities, now what about that?
The harshest reality is, you look away
while the suns till shines and the flag still waves goodbye.
Farewell. You get on my nerves.
In the end, you'll get what you fucking deserve!

Your moral highness, you're just like them.
You piss and you moan again and again,
how pity the lesser, well boo fucking hoo.
If payback's a bitch, she's ruthless like you.
Took for granted all the things you got.
Rejected, neglected any food for thought.
Your shallow yet narrow world's closing in
ever so quickly as payback begins.
Goodbye. Farewell. You get on my nerves.
In the end, you'll get what you fucking deserve!

Payback for how you act. Payback.
You'll get what you fucking deserve!

Pray for this and you pray for that
while you pimp your atrocities, now what about that?
The harshest reality is, you look away
while the suns till shines and the flag still waves goodbye.
Farewell. You get on my nerves.
In the end, you'll get what you fucking deserve!
Payback!
Payback!
Payback!
You'll get what you fucking deserve!
