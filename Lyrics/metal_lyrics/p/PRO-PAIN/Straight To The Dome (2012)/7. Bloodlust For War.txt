A reign of terror takes it's grip on unsuspecting prey trough violence.
Anger is the energy, basis for hate.
Annihilate the enemy, no time to waste.
The sweetness of victory, I pause to taste,
while they lie and die in agony. Such a disgrace.
Anger is the energy, basis for hate.
Annihilate the enemy, no time to waste.
The sweetness of victory, I pause to taste,
I guess you could say that I bloodlust for war.
I guess you could say that I bloodlust for war.

Lord please take away thy pain
so I'll be free to kill again
cause that is what I live for.
Don't forsake my intent to use your conscience against you.
The truth is that I bloodlust for war.

Shattered lives are left in ruins with no one left all to pick up the pieces.
Nobody's at a loss and nobody cares.
Desensitized to the core, that's what we are.
War is in the air, it stinks for sure,
and we couldn't care less, we lust for more.
Nobody's at a loss and nobody cares.
Desensitized to the core, that's what we are.
War is in the air, it stinks for sure,
I guess you can say that I bloodlust for war.
I guess you can say that I bloodlust for war.

Tortured souls, nocturnal days, eternal days and evil ways.
Just what we've waited for all our lives.
Blessed be thine callous darkened heart of mine.
The truth is that I bloodlust for war.

Bloodlust for war.
I guess you can say that I bloodlust for war.

Lord please take away thy pain
