Well I've never been known to mince my words, some call me "judge". 
I'm so blissfully fixated that it's getting kinda hard just to get me to budge. 
Well I'm authoritative and legislative, and now I wanna rule your roost, 
and I've sworn to tackle the issues which nobody gives a flying fuck about.

Judge! I'm your bystander. 
Judge! I'm your worst spectator. 
Judge! With no explanations. 
Judge! Or any expectations. 
Judge! You're on low heat, 
and it's the judge who occupies this seat. 
Looking to pass the time of day and fixin' to put you all away. 

Protect and serve the powers that be, well that's me, 
and you'll see that I'm here just to fuck you over, and forever so forcefully. 
The promises made are promises broken in my mind, 
and you'll find that the truth you seek will never see the light of day again, 
for justice is blind. 

Judge! I'm your bystander. 
Judge! I'm your worst spectator. 
Judge! With no explanations. 
Judge! Or any expectations. 
Judge! You're on medium heat, 
and its the judge who occupies this seat. 
Looking to pass the time of day, and fixin' to put you all away. OK? 

Judge...

As the gavel drops we get some order in the court. 
The defense was heard and we've had about enough of your remarks and retorts. 
The court shall take a brief recess to prepare the accused for incarceration.
Guess I'll take it as a win, cause either way you lose. 

Judge! I'm the gold standard.
Judge! I'm your worst dictator. 
Judge! And your exploitation. 
Judge! Is my excitation. 
Judge! You're on high heat, and its the judge who occupies this seat. 
Looking to put you all away, this judge is here to stay.
