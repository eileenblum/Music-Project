Dead and lifeless inside.
I've been that way for all my life.
In raw emotion we hide,
and tend to loose ourselves in this abyss.
Abandon all hope, man the life boat and cast your cares aside.
Now clench your teeth and fists. Forever seize this moment!

I'm running out of time, I'm gonna loose my mind.
Can't you see I've nothing left, left to lose.
I've given this my all. You'll never see me fall.
I beat the best, I'll beat the rest.
So now you have been forewarned.

I frayed the end of my rope
and prayed for reason, to fucking cope.
You think I care, but I don't.
You seem to think that I wont end it all with you first.
You'll be the last to know and the first to go in a long hit list of hate.
I'll seal your fate and desecrate you.

Don't miscalculate my hate cause the truth is I'm irate.
Can't you see I've nothing left, left to lose.
I promise you I'll wait so make your last mistake
and rest assured your apathy will get you eventually.

Dead and lifeless inside.
I've been that way for all my life.
In raw emotion we hide,
and tend to loose ourselves in this abyss.
Abandon all hope, man the life boat and cast your cares aside.
Now clench your teeth and fists. Forever seize this moment!

I'm running out of time, I'm gonna loose my mind.
Can't you see I've nothing left, left to lose.
I've given this my all. You'll never see me fall.
I beat the best, I'll beat the rest.
So now you have been forewarned.
