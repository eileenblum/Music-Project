they don't care what you say
they don't care what you do
they don't care what you think
it's killing me and killing you
fuck this bullshit
better do something fast
first impression, make it last
call it democracy
that's all for you and none for me
show us that you care

well we aint gonna be the first
and we aint gonna be the last
by giving us all the worst
we made it the fuckin best
our hearts still get pumpin
when the times are tough
but the times keep changing
so we best step up - step up

the final war has just begun
it's one for all and all for one
we'll let them know how we feel
we'll play it hard and keep it real
uncage our rage
the enemy is all around
take your pick and shoot him down
rebellion is the only way
we'll live to see a better day
keep your hands held high

as we enter the black hole
and it's suckin us fuckin dry
it's swallowin all the pride
never asking the question why
we fight for our rights
til the very last breath
emerging as victor
in life and in death - in death
we shall overcome
