ground troops are chasin
the whites of your eyes
close all the doors and
take a word from the wise
arm personnel and
deploy in the sand
drive like a knife
through the heart of the land

the heart of the land
where time stood still
against our will
won't get no rest until

we're in for the kill

bombs over head will make you
fall to your knees
warheads are launched
with infectious disease
no place to run to and
nowhere to hide
so why did you take us
along for the ride?

along for the ride
where time stood still
against our will
won't get no rest until

we're in for the kill
