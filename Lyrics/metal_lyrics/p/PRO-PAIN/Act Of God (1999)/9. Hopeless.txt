reap what you sew
if that's what you believe
blessed is the truth
beneath the web that you weave
holier than thou
were those that paved the way
for the world to fall apart
forever and a day

no, you can't bring us down
we don't need you around
fuck you!!! why should we care
when this is not our cross to bear

nation under god
and justice for all?
were gonna pay the price
cause somebody dropped the ball
long, lean, and mean
loud, pissed, and proud
we're coming to seek revenge
we're walking against the crowd

no, you can't bring us down
we don't need you around
fuck you!!! why should we care
when this is not our cross to bear

hopeless?
