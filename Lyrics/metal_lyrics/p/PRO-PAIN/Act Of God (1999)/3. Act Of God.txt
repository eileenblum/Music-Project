I believe that we've
deceived our sons -
they feel betrayed
how can we repent
to save ourselves
and face the day
rise up above the ash
do you see the wrath?
can you feel the reign?
lie on a bed of nails.
paying for your sins.
can you take the pain?

act of god
is what we'll bring
the war's on us
when everything's all said and done

in the end we try to mend
the scars we left behind
pay the toll to sell
the soul and strip
and search the mind
burn weaker than before.
we cannot ignore
a blessing in the skies.
the dark before the dawn
cast upon the earth
plans for our demise

act of god
is what we'll bring
the war's on us
when everything's all said and done
