it's the crime of the centry
and millions are killed
the cupboards are empty
and pockets are filled
a vicous intention
to cut like a knife
in light of redemption
you fight for your life
innocence is lost
and it cannot be found
hence the holocaust
tis' in sorrow we drown

all fall down

now the guns are for hire
to kill on command
we jump in the fire
the time is at hand
we'll keep it together
and take it to heart
this hopeless endeavor
till death do us part
innocence is lost
and it cannot be found
hence the holocaust
tis in sorrow we drown

all fall down
