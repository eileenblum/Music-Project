falling apart at the seams
but rolling as fast as we can
we're searching for some in betweens
and answers from only a man
who promised to help us to live
and begged us to borrow our trust
I gave it with not much to give
a lie to my face was unjust

that wasn't how it was suppose to be
so stand in line and wait your turn
cause there's injustice for all to see
fan the flames and watch it burn

recklessly crushing your dreams
they leave us forever in debt
well nothin's as good as it seems
if this is as good as it gets
desperately clinging to hope
they raised us to merely exist
we pick up the pieces to cope
cause we are the last on their list

that wasn't how it was suppose to be
so stand in line and wait your turn
cause there's injustice for all to see
fan the flames and watch it burn

dry my eyes, and all fall from grace
tell no lies, to my face
hear my call, and take your stand
reject all, rise and fall
