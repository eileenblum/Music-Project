now we've seen it all before
and there will come a time
when we'll see it all again
frown upon a distant shore
with intent to pulverize
and sacrifice our men

we live
we learn
to love this senseless on parade

what now? we've taken it to far
we'd drawn and crossed the line
like no one else before
is this a test of who we are?
then we must not forget
our casualties of war

we live. we learn. to love this senseless on parade

throw us up against that wall
objections overruled %NEWBLOCK%they've got us by the balls
we just never seem to learn that
our country tis of thee sweet land
of crash and burn

we live
we learn
we love this senseless on parade
