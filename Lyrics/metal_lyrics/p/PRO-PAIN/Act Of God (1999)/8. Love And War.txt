crucify yourself
if you can save your face
justify all your wealth
and leave that nasty taste
seek and ye shall find
a world of discontent
so sign that bottom line
to pass the time well spent

I've waited all my life to live
I've given all I had to give
I ran beyond that extra mile
I've got to make this all worth while

all is fair in love and war

dignified, we speak
and all of us are never heard
truth is all we seek
lash out and spread the word
paradise is lost
and nothing is the same
every line was crossed
and no one took the blame

I've waited all my life to live
I've given all I had to give
I ran beyond that extra mile
I've got to make this all worth while

all is fair in love and war
