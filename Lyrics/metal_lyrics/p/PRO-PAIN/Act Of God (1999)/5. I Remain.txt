busted out back in 82'
a buncha kids with nothin to do
played bass, had a beat up car
no plans of takin it far
messed around,
got a couple of gigs
no chance of makin it big
some folks tried to bring us down
didn't know we had
our feet on the ground

don't wanna be nobodys tool
I ain't got the time to play the fool
don't wanna go down in flames
so for now I remain -

I remain

second wind circa 92'
took a chance and started anew
grass roots and a common cause
set pace and opened the doors
case in point -
it was outta control
with no sign of sellin a soul
you breakdown when the stakes are high
life sucks
and we're all gonna die

don't wanna be nobodys tool
I ain't got the time to play the fool
don't wanna go down in flames
so for now I remain -

I remain
