Now, this is the end.
You cannot mistake this is it, it's over my friend.
Like they say, "it's been real".
Your questions, like me just get old, and that's how I feel.
Cut throat, then you run away.
No hope, just another death, and just another day.
You, you're making me sick and chances are you'll never know
just what makes us tick.

Now, you think it's ok
to use me, abuse me, talk shit and
send me on ray way.
Cut throat, then you run away.
No hope, just another death, and just another day.
I, I'm back once again.
For he who shall both do and teach is divine, amen.
Life has made me content.
My actions speak loudly, no need for further comment.
