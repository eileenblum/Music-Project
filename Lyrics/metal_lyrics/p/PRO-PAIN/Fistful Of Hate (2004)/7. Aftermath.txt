Eyes on fire, burning flames, seas of blood.
Skies of soot, acid rain, toxic mud.
Tortured souls in body bags, scents of death.
Melted limbs, blood on ice, and blackened breath

Last taste of war. forever more.
All life is gone, bloodshed no more.
Lifeless we lie under the sun.
Now all's said and done

Wasted days, killing time, fall from grace
Take the stand, who's your god, what's your faith?
Trails gone cold, end's in sight, lose your mind.
Seal your fate, leave us all left behind.

Life under siege, none lives to greive
All left to die, nature's relieved.
No place to rest, frightened we run.
When all's said and done.
