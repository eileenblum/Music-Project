Few face it, but times they change.
So you gotta go with the flow.
I'm uncertain to change my ways.
To scream bloody murders all I know.
Spit venom at every turn
and I could give a fuck what you say.
I lie bleeding to lick my wounds
and throw down mother fucker to get my way

God is on my side,
and this will cause you pain.
Watch our worlds collide.
Death's to fall like rain, and leave us
longing so don't fuck with ray head
I'll leave us all, all left for dead.

I seize weapons of choice.
I mislead as I see fit.
To sense fear in your voice is bliss.
Complete satisfaction's what I'll get.
I'll kick back and I'll watch you all
die like your fuckin diseased.
I'll throw nails to catch your fall.
Mace will bring you to your knees.

Hate begins to rise.
Blood upon your hands.
Right before your eyes,
next to god I'll stand and leave you
longing for hope, hanging your head,
I'll leave you all, all left for dead.
