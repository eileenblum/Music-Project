Hot damn, now that duke got his man
well it's safe to say his mind is at ease.
All told, he sold out the old
and smiled and said the public agrees.
Think tank fatty laughed to the bank,
a greedy mother fucker is he.
No brains, yanking our chains
and makin livin shitty for me

Got a fistful of hate!. Got a fistful of hate!

Bring down the resident clown
while he's sittin' at the top of the hill.
Drunk swagger with an empty head,
some said "this imp is run of the mill".
Can't stop a pig in the slop.
You've got to try and do what you can.
Raise hell, and I wish you well.
I stand to reason, I'm just a man

With a fistful of hate! With a fistful of hate!

Fistful of hate! Fistful of hate!
