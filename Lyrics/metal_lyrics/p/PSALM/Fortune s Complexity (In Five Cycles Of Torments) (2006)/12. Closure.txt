[lyrics by T. Dossogne &amp; S. Austin]

Bite the hand that feeds on fear
Waiting for the night's sorrow
I'm the clown of black and blue
If they shoot that's why I'll shoot
Finally free
Feel love nor hate
Worked so hard and feels so good
Lived my life misunderstood
Why I killed a world so good?
Too bad I'm misunderstood
Wish you were deadâ¦
Wish you were deadâ¦
Motherless
Fatherless
Forever seems so close
Sure you'll feel pain and sorrow
It only lasts for so long
I commit to human fate
This is how I like to live
Bigger than you and I, once again
I always die!
Blind journey into unreal dementia
I'm left with no choice but letting go
I am safe, the eye is open
I am safe, the eye is open
Wish you were dead!
Wish you were dead!
Blind journey into unreal dementia
I'm left with no choice but letting go
Lost all my senses
