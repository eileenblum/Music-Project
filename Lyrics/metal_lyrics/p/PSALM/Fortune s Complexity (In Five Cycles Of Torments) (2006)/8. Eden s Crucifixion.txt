[lyrics by T. Dossogne]

Bitterness, my loyal friend
I shot you in my veins
She chose for another life
Where the hell did it go wrong?
Some feelings will never die
My last breath will whisper your name
It hurts to admit but I've lost track
Don't want no help, for this is my grief
Crucified
Labyrinth of chimeras
Crucified
Euphoric dance of insanity
Crucified
Grand opening at the theatre of loss
Crucified
I must make the apostasy of you
Ego's bleeding
Eden's burning
Ripped of pride, ripped of self-esteem
Naked in the freezing cold
I took my scars, I've carried on
Why can't I just forget your name?
Dreamer, I'm shattered inside
Stronger, yet dead inside
I used to see a glimpse of paradise through your eyes
Nevermore
Shall I be the same but I don't hate you
How did love die in your heart?
How did you grow apart from me?
All these questions I can't answer
I guess I'll never know
What could have been my existence
But life goes on just the same, unforgiving
Now your name fades away
I'm drifting off in disarray
Now your kiss fades away
You were never meant to stay
Bless your soul, darling
Just forget all of this
Don't you look behind
To see the fallen angel
You've enlightened my heart and my soul
This is the memory of you I have kept
I hope you'll remember me somehow
Though Eden's dead and buried
