[lyrics by T. Dossogne]

Locked in, trapped in
This prison of guilt
Boundaries are gone
First step in no man's land
Can't love you, no
Can't touch, can't feel
Ain't gonna survive this ride
What if my life was yours?
Between passion and reason
Must choose between two hearts
I'm confused inside
I feel like giving up my life
And my past
I can't see clearly
Must take a step back
Must try to forget
You can't just throw away what you have built
I'm just not worth it, believe me
And I'll never be able to face her again
The woman who sees only me
Taking a wrong turn would
Annihilate a beloved one's heart
Please, you have to let me go
I'm just not ready to start over again
Turning point of my life and yours
We must erase it all
Don't try to reach me again
Please forget what we had
You're gone
Now I breathe
You're gone
Now it hurts
Truth I cannot tell
Love, it feeds on me
Don't look back
Buried love
Empty shell
Don't look back
Time will heal
Dying heart
Life's back on the right track
