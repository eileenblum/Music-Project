[lyrics by K. Lerminiau]

Born with a precious fear of love
Grow with a precious fear of love
Die with a famous feel of love
I'm gonna show!
Just love
We are blind now
Save your passions, don't be an evil son
Build nations
Draw the line upon your system
Take the time to use your patience
Watch around the sky
Watch around the sky
Walk
To the serpents
'Til you find them
Start your defence
Born with a precious fear of love you cannot show
Grow with a precious fear of love you wanna show
Die with a famous feel of love I'm gonna show
My cries will be known
So it will be my own joy
My cries will be known
Known!
These eyes, full of sickness
On his better hatred
No! We are not
We are not alone in this world
I believe I give you love
Stay with me, I will give you love
No-love-scene
No-hope-scene
No-love-scene
No more scenes
My cries will be known
Your lies will be shown
No more walking in a no-love-scene!
