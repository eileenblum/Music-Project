[lyrics by T. Dossogne]

Dust sows branches somehow passing
Through black water which embraces
My weakened feet, my heart turns still
Roots grip my arms slowly
Losing my breath slowly
I feel sorry for myself
Satisfy me, never trust me again!
Walls seem dry
Yet insecure
I'm digging a hole and I prepare my end
You think you will save us?
I don't deserve a place in your heaven
Can't stand the smell of my own fear, no more
I don't deserve this prison of treason
Can't stand the smell of my own fear, no more
Staring, threatening, vulgar pile of stones
Weeping, mourning, colder, it chills my bones
Facing each day, try to deny
Playing this part
Can't take it no more
I feel sorry for myself
Satisfy me, never trust me again!
Now all lies subside
And I realize
How I lived my life
And this can't be true!
And I
I just realized
My world crumbles
Facing each day, just too hard
Try to deny, I can't force it!
Playing this part, it's over now!
Reason left me, I can't take it!
All hope is gone
I'm already dead
