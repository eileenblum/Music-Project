The beauty of Israel is slain,
tell it not in Gath lest philistine women boast.
On thee O Gilboa mountain no dew shall fall,
for there my brother fell.
How are the mighty fallen.
victorious in war they where no,
hungry sword returned.
Swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
Pleasent they where father and son.
How...
even in death not devided.
Weep for them O daughters of my people.
The beauty you wear was paid with their swords.
Scarlet robes and ornaments of gold. 
How...
Even in the midst of the battle.
O Jonathan thou wast slain,
O dear fiend of mine I mourn.
Pleasant unto me you were, thy love wonderful it was,
passing the love of women!!
How...
how are they perished these swords of war.
