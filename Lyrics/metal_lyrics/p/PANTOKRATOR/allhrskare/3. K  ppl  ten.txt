He spoke light was born,
by its beams was darkness torn.
Creator of earth and heavenly realm my
poor soul you overwhelm.
You gave the breath of life, you broke my pride.
I came to life and my sin deid.
You spoke, light was born,
in my heart the veil was torn..
.you are everything to me,
you set me free...
