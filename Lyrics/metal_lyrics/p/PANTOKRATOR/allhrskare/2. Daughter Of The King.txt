She is all, she is more than i need,
for more than her no man could ever plead.
Gentle sa the soft rains of the fall God has not created
In all his wisdom a spirit more beautiful.
The sweet breeze of her Whisper brakes my shell, brakes me,
in the sound of her beating heart I am lost will always be.
These words so dry; and my heart is all that I can give.
Everything I have can not pay what to her I owe.
Your daughter o God, I tremble with fear,
how can I keep the one you hold so dear?
this treasure of love how can I receive?
the trust you have given I can not believe.
For her I`ll bleed, for her I`ll die,
trade my life without the wink of an eye.
So this much you love me, you trust me this much.
You let me hold in my arms this beauty
that I merely dare to touch.
So Almighty God lord of all land,
down on my kness I ask for her hand.
