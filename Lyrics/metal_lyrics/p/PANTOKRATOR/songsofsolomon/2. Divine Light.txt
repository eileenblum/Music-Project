Lord El-shadai we pay thee homage,
we thank thee for thy gift of love,
the sweet caress of erotic desire
burning with intensity beyond the flame of fire.
Hearts yearn bodies burn in devine light,
light shining since the word as spoken
sincebeams sprang forth from the dark of the void.
New life is growing everywhere,
bursting through the concrete walls of man.
Lord El-shadai all honour belongs to thee.
You are the artist, all beauty sprang from thee,
and thy kingdom will last forever more.
