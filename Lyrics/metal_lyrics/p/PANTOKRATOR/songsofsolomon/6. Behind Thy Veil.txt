Threescore of queens,
fourscore of concubines.
Virgins without numbers
like the clusters of the vines,
but you are one my dove.
You are the one,
you have conquered my love.
Fair as the pale moon,
glorious as the sun,
awesome like the army of stars in the sky,
infinite and wide.
Thy breasts are like fruits that I long to taste,
that I long to hold.
You are so fair so beautiful and bold.
You are my love, my flawless one,
with you I will forever be.
