Before time was named
Before the world was formed
The earth was dark and void
Was this before the counting of days?
A mystery interpreted in many ways

Eden was a fruitful realm
Watered by a mighty river divided into four
One of them was Pishon
The river of Havilah
A land of gold and precious stones.
Treasures long forgotten
Or spread among the nations
Its origin is hidden in the sands of time
And in the scriptures of the ancients
The ancient ones
