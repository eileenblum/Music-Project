Into the wilderness I must go
Wilderness of the earth
Where Lilith found her peace
Where restless spirits roam

Battleground of the soul
In the void I will face
Only what I brought
The abyss of my soul

Into the wilderness
The scapegoat took my sin
Into the realm of Azazel
In the barren waste satan found defeat
From the world of shadows
My master came forth
In the grave, the son reclaimed the keys
From the deep the scapegoat has returned

Through the desert lands the elect are called
And in our footsteps
Fountains shall spring forth

Into the wilderness I must go
Wilderness of the earth
Where moses saw the light
A fire burning bright

Battleground of the soul
In the void I will find
Only what I seek
The saviour of my soul

Into the wilderness
The scapegoat took my sin
Into the realm of Azazel
From the world of Sheol
My master came forth
From the deep the scapegoat has returned
