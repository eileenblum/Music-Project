As a beast I lack the common sense of man
So much I do not know, I fail to understand

More brutish than any man

I do not know the holy, tell me now
Who hath bound the oceans In his garments
And established the borders of the earth?

I was as a beast before thee
More brutish than any man

I do not know the holy, tell me now
Who has ascended into the heavens
And gathered the wind in his fist?

I was as a beast before thee
More brutish than any man

I do not know the holy, tell me now
What is his name, what is the name of his son
If thou canst tell?

As a beast I lack the dignity of man
The laws of holiness I can not comprehend

I was as a beast before thee
More brutish than any man

I do not know the holy, tell me now!
Who holds the world in his hand?
