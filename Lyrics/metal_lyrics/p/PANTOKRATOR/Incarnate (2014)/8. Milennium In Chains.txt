Caught by the neck like a ragged cat. / Dangling in the iron fist like a filthy slab of septic flesh / A sight for sore eyes this self-proclaimed god / helpless in the hands of a mere angel
When the cat is gone we dance having the feast of our lives. / For our human race this is our golden days.
This is our day of celebration, this is your time of detention / This our messianic coronation, is your millennium in chains
We know you will return to launch your final attack / You haunt our dreams until we are utterly rid of you
Like a festering boil in the body of existence. / Ready to burst the skin and kindle hell of earth
The time lock snapped and the reign of peace was ended / The earth was cracked and the powers of hell ascended.
