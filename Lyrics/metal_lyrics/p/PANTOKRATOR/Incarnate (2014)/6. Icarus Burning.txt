Angel of beauty, bringer of light, / Cherubim flawless in splendour. / Transformed from within, rotting like a corpse / Infested by pride, pestilence of the soul. / There is no words for your betrayal, not in any tongue. / The throne of thrones...yeah you wish!
What had never been arose in you. / You had it all, but all was not enough. / Shadows of darkness enshrouded your heart as / You deceived yourself.
Master of self-deception, if I knew not your deeds I might even pity you. / You are insane in a way hubris cannot explain. / You are the blueprint for Icarus, yet the sun is but a firefly compared / To the object of your desire.
-I will arise and take the place of God! / Desperately grasping for power that day, you lost your glory forever. / You fell, falling forevermore.
