(Blessed are the poor in spirit, theirs is the kingdom of God. Blessed are the ones that mourn, they will be leaping with joy.)
Forgive the unforgiving, love your enemies, rise above in mercy but never bow. I have made you royal, I share my throne with you.
Come I will bring you revolution, it begins in the hearts of man. The light shines in darkness and the dark cannot prevail / I ask you to believe, not to understand.
Blessed are the humble of heart, they will inherit the Earth. / Blessed are the bringers of peace, they are the children of God. / You will raise from the ashes of this age / and behold the rising of the never setting sun.
Blessed are you when men despise you, / persecute and criticise you for the sake of my name. / You are the salt of the earth , the light of the world, / the city upon the hill / forged in fire, and in blood.
You are the dawn, the voice of the world beyond.
