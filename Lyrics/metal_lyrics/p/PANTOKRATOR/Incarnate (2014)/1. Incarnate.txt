What cannot be but was / deity bound in flesh / ambivalent in human weakness. / Sacred and holy in divinity, the universe was in your hand
You were a lonely star a ray of light in the dark, / darkness cannot stand the light,
and morning sun devourers the night,
Your coming was a miracle, hardly a surprise. / It was foretold in visions and dreams and in the stars long before.
Set the sky ablaze!!
In the time of the sign, as it says in the scroll / you where brought Into this world Through a virgins womb / You dwelt among us like a storm held in the palm of a hand. / Nothing was hidden from your eyes.
You have been here before, when time had no name / you were the word spoken in the void before the first breath of Man
When the trumpet sounds / your time has come to / ride the wings of fire. / you will stand once more / on the mount of olives. / and all evil shall burn / in your glorious light
