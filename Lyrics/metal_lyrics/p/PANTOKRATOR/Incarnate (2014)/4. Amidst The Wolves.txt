I have chosen you in the womb, / you who persecuted those who follow me, / and opposed me in your blindness, / but I will open your eyes to the unseen, / and reveal to you the unspeakable, / I will open your ears to my secrets
Behold I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves
I will make you solid as the earth
Under my flag I will protect you among your own people. / Under my flag I will protect you among the heathens / to whom i send you out.
I give you the heat of fire. / I give you speed of the wind. / I give you the depth of the ocean.
