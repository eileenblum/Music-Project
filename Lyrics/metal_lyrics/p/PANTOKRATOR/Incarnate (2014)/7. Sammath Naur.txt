This is the end of the line! This is your wakeup call / itâs served with the stench of brimstone it comes / with the smoke of burning flesh
A millennium in chains still your pride knows no bounds / Do you think you escaped from the deep?
IT WAS WRITTEN it was all in the plan
HE WAS WAITING waiting for your mindless clones
WAI TING UPON the golden walls
TO UNLEASH A nameless fear
IT IS TIME TO settle the score
AND NEVER shalt thou be...
Finally this is the end, this is the end of all ends... this is death, this is the death of death.
It is over Apolyon, no more will you rape the earth!!! The hands that you nailed will throw you into the flame..
It is over, it was over from the dawn of time, your armies / will burn in fire divine, The lake of fire is calling your name / into Sammath Naur!!
