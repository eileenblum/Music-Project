Oh Michael ever faithful you stayed by the side of your King / when others cried out for a new order, demanding the throne for their kind, / following the rising star of Lucifer blinded by his light and lust for power / Today knight of heaven, you reap your reward. / Finally unleashed in your burning rage, / War in heaven, blood upon earth and sea! / for the powers collide over thee.
Cry out drunk with victory, Armageddon in the highest / your foes are falling like burning leaves, you are the reaper of God. / holocaust-harvest of burning wings on the celestial fields.
A roar in heavens, Thunder over earth and sea! / for the fallen descend over thee.
Rejoice in the heavens, victory is in your hands / For the dragon and his angels / they cannot withstand Your Sword.
There is no place in the heavens for the father of murder and lies, / there is no room for the carcass and the swarm of unholy flies. / He would rather rule a doungheap, then serve in marble halls. / That old serpent who is called devil and Satan,
Rejoice ye heavens, But woe to the earth and the sea / For the Devil is cast down to thee with fierce burning wrath, / for he knows his time is short....
