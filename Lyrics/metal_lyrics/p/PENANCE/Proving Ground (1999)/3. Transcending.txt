[Music: Weston/Leard/Smail]
[Lyrics: Balich/Smail]

The astral doors are opening
Bidding me to step on through
A cosmic finger points the way
Past skies of black and seas of doom

Transcending now this mortal form
Solar sailing on stellar waves
My soul has gone beyond time itself
Mind expanding through celestial terrain
Distant landscapes appear - yet I have no fear

Spinning through the vortex of mystic light and sound
The answers lie before me the questions yet to be found
Lost and found adrift in a lunar sea
Looking down at Earth and the life I used to lead

Myriad dreams in multi-color
Leading me past Saturn's rings
Translucid spectrum like no other
Secrets of God unraveling
