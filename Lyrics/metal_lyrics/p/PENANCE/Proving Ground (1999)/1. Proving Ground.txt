[Lyrics: Weston/Balich]

Obsessed with this therapy
It's a reflection of self
My motivation is clear
It's just how I felt

This machine that I've created
Really pulls me through
Like no other
For no other
It's just for me... maybe you

Sometimes I'm on the outside
Looking in on empty lives
I may not think like you
I've got my own mind

Cause in the end all the matters
Is that I've lived life my own way
And that I can look myself in the mirror
In the end will you say the same?

I feel at home... In my own... Proving Ground

I feel at home... In my own... Proving Ground

Obsessed with this therapy
It's a reflection of self
My motivation is clear
It's just how I felt

This machine that I've created
Really pulls me through
Like no other
For no other
It's just for me... maybe you

I feel at home... In my own... Proving Ground

I feel at home... In my own... Proving Ground
