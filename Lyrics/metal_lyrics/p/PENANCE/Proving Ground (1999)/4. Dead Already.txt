[Music: Weston]
[Lyrics: Balich]

Crawling through your mind
A cancer on the inside
Spreading sickness 'til no life remains

You let me gain a foothold
Now, I'll never let go
I will choke your spirit down to its last breath

You are dead already
I'm just placing pennies on your eyes

I'm the immoral
The one corrupting your soul
But my work's made easier with a some help from you

Your fear of living
Led you to your end
What is life, my friend, when you only look to death?

You are dead already
I'm just placing pennies on your eyes

Broken... Dying... Rotting
Your life is nothing!

Broken... Dying... Rotting
Your life's worth nothing!
