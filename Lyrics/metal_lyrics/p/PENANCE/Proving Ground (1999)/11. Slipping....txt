[Music: Weston]
[Lyrics: Weston]

I, too, hear the cracking
The fury of the wind
The sound of everything crumbling
And fear it will not mend

You are one I've known forever
Yet your face has changed
Your soul is somehow different
Its aura rearranged
I've let too much slip through
And dread you'll finally see
This darkness I've been hiding
Deep inside of me

My total lust for chaos
and confusion that I feel
Pain, suffering, and misery
And demons all too real

The end is drawing near
And no one seems to care
Things have come and gone before
There's no need to shed a tear

All the warnings go ignored
As the final curtain falls
I feel nothing and I fear the same
As I stare straight into the sun
