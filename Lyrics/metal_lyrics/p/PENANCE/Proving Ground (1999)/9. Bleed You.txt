[Music: Smail/Weston]
[Lyrics: Balich]

Sometimes I wanna cut myself
So you'll flow out of my veins
The kiss that tainted my blood
Is beating down my heart again

I want to bleed you from my heart
I want to bleed you from my veins
I want to kill you... in my mind
I want to bleed away the pain

These days the colors fade to grey
All my hope and dreams now melt away
Lost soul in turmoil crying out
I'm wrenching out my guts again

I want to bleed you from my heart
I want to bleed you from my veins
I want to kill you... in my mind
I want to bleed away the pain

Why won't you die???
