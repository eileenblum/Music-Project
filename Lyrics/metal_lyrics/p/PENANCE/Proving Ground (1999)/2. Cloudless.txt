[Music: Weston]
[Lyrics: Weston]

Breathing in this life I'm livin' yeah
The taste is bitter sweet
All the hardships endured
I anticipate
The time when I'm solid

Looking past the downpours
To a day that's cloudless

Now, each day I pray
The turmoil will pass
I'm hoping that today is the day
That there'll be no more stress
Or any pain
And I will hear your laughter once again

Looking past the downpours
To a day that's cloudless

Now the darkness has gone
And we've said goodbye
But I won't forget no matter how I try
And today is so bright
And your smile's like the sun
Bringing the world back to life again

I've weathered the storms
And today is cloudless
