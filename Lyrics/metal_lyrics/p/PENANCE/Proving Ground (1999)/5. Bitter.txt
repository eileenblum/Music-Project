[Music: Smail]
[Lyrics: Balich]

When the night is gettin' old
And the air is gettin' colder
You know I'll never fold up
I turn my back on fear...

As I lie awake alone
And the voices come to taunt me
Every night another haunting
Driving me beyond my years...

When sleep finally flies me away
Under crimson clouds of pain
All my regrets have taken shape
As bitter tears that fall like rain

Hey - I think I'm ready
To confront the things in life that are haunting me
Hey - If it takes me all my days
I'll drive away the bitter tears of pain

Phantoms of what could have been
Now come to tempt my soul to sin
Dark purple mountains of misery
Bring the weight of the world on me

Hey - I think I'm ready
To confront the things in life that are haunting me
Hey - If it takes me all my days
I'll drive away the bitter tears of pain

So tired of the pain - the never ending strain
It's time I made the change
It's time to rearrange...

'Cause I - I think I'm ready
To confront the things in life that are haunting me
Hey - If it takes me all my days
I'll drive away the bitter tears of...
Pain
