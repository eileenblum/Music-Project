[Music: Smail/Weston]
[Lyrics: Smail]

Gaunt figures of a dismal world
Cast in grey with tattered flags unfurled
Gone beyond just me and you
The perfect symmetry of being ripped in two

Blue is the color of life
While you're cast in grey
All the years of tomorrow
That are gone today

Pallid shadows of a sight unseen
Revealing truths of the machine
Gossamer wings that could never fly
Paint new horizons for you and I

Blue is the color of life
While you're cast in grey
All the years of tomorrow
That are gone today

Heaven sends
And Hell awaits
With patience

Smile at you with rage
As I emerge from
Hatred

Lying in wait unbridled fury
Laced with self-titled glory
Crimson tides and ashen dreams
Will rise above make you believe

Moonlight backdrop of one dimension
Multi-layers of my invention
Weaving spells cast to the wind
Reliving things that could have been
