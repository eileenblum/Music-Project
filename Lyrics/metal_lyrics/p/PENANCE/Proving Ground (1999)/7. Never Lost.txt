[Music: Weston]
[Lyrics: Smail]

All through life
Whatever I've been dealt
I've taken it in stride
And I've always felt
Sure of myself
Confident with pride
Rode through it all
Grounded from inside

Always

Even through
The adversity
I never let the pain
Break the will in me
It made me stronger
Set more my beliefs
All I have is what I am
And that's all I'll ever need

Always

Stand your ground
With yourself intact
Surround yourself with love
It always comes back

Always

Always
