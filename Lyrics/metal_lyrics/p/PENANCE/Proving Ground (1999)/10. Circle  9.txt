[Music: Weston]
[Lyrics: Balich]

This mortal path I tread its trials are killing me
As swirling winds of change now blow inside of me
And clouds of ash have blinded eyes that once could see
The path to happiness that lies in front of me

Looking down at circle number nine
Where my soul will fly
Circle number nine

The temporary light you've shown upon my heart
Kaleidoscoping stars obscure the obvious
The longer I embrace that which can never be
The more the tongues of fire reach out to lash at me

Looking down at circle number nine
Where my soul will fly
Circle number nine

I'm looking out from circle number nine?
Where my soul resides
Circle number nine

Looking up from circle number nine?
Where my soul resides
Circle number nine...
