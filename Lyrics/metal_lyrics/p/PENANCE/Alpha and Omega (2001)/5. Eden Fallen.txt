Reaching for the heavens
But my hands are full of holes
The holes in my hands
Won't let me grasp the stars

Reaching for the heavens
But my hands are full of holes
The holes in my hands
Won't let me grasp the stars
So long I've been a dreamer
My head high up in the sky
But my wings wetted down
Would never let me fly

My arms are growing weary
Stardust in my eyes
My heart full of envy
Longing to be satisfied
Reaching for glory
Reaching for the sun
Reaching for the magic
That will make me one with the gods

Reaching for the heavens
But my hands are full of holes
The holes in my hands
Won't let me grasp the stars
For years my spirits traveled
Round the circles of beyond
It never will rest
It will carry on
