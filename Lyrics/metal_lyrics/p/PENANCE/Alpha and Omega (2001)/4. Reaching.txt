It's on the wings of sin that I've been flying
And your face is the sun that I have touched
And in the gardens of delight where I've been lying
Suddenly there's darkness instead of love

And now Eden's gonna fall

It's you that I looked to, to heal this heartache
And for a time you answered all my prayers
I was all too blind now Eden's fallen
My paradise was lost leaving me in tears

And now Eden's gonna fall
