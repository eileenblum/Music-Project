So long I've searched for answers to my life
The great mystery of being
I've yearned for validation from without
When I should have looked within

In every mind resides the soul, the second self
The you so seldom known
The you that holds the light to cut the blackness
You were born into long ago

We are all the wizards of our minds
And we each can work the spell
To open gates of deeper understanding
And to storm the gates of fate itself
