Here I stand looking into you
No need to tell me what you're going through
Cause man I've been there myself

When life dealt out pain
I'd swallow it and hold it in
Then I learned to unlock the scream
Buried deep within
Now parts standing still are moving

Reborn as a new machine

Here I stand looking into myself
Reflecting on the times that I conquered hell
Prides swelling up within me

I hold the keys to lock away the stress and strain
I'll change the color of the rain
I've learned I hold that power

Power of a new machine
Living as a new machine
