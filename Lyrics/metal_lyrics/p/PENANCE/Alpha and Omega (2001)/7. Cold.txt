I've opened myself up
Exposed my vulnerability
Yet all you can do is sit there in silence
Leaving me empty

God forbid you should show some emotion
God forbid you should ease my pain
God forbid you allowed me security
That all my words have not been in vain

Goddamn you for silently choking me
Goddamn you you've frozen my soul
Goddamn you for keeping me hanging on
I burned for you yet you remained cold

I've risked much to love you
Yet you're content to take without giving
Drink in all my love
So smug in the knowledge
Like a fool I'll keep coming back again

God forbid you should open your eyes up
God forbid you should look at what's true
God forbid you attempted to right the wrongs
Of all the hell you're putting me through

Goddamn you for silently choking me
Goddamn you you've frozen my soul
Goddamn you for keeping me hanging on
I burned for you yet you remained cold
