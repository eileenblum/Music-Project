All you feel is pain
Huddled there in the dark
Looking for the last bad reason
To end it all
Well I've been watching you
In your self made hell
And you don't see the pain
You cause yourself

Won't you see the light?
Won't you see the light?

In a world of pain
There is always a way
Reach inside yourself
For the keys to a brighter day
And if you're ever afraid
Know that I'm by your side
You won't travel alone
I'll help you find the light

Won't you see the light?
Won't you see the light?
