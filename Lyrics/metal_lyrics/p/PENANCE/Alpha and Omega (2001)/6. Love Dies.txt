A bleaker day I've never seen
Reality has settled in
Cause when I look at you I'm sick inside
When I think that what we shared has died

Love dies... only pain survives

The cruelest of all illusions
Darkest of all deceptions
I naively believed that love transcends years
Now I gaze in terror as it disappears

Love dies... only pain survives

Love dies
