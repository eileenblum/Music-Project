The memory lives in me to this day
I awake that morning to sorrow and to pain
I stand silent amidst the cries
Told your soul's been called
Robbed of all your guidance
When it was needed most

Drown me in a sea of empty
Deliver me to nothingness
Beyond the door where pain can't reach me
Drown me in a sea of empty

Never one to voice my pain so I tucked it away
And tears I never cried sit with me to this day
Sometimes I wish I couldn't feel
I'd feel your loss no more
Rip out my emotions
Cast them to nevermore

Drown me in a sea of empty
Deliver me to nothingness
Beyond the door where pain can't reach me
Drown me in a sea of empty

[Refrain]
