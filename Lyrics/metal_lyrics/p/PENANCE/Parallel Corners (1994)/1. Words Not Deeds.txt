[Music: Weston/Smail]
[Lyrics: Smail]

What is real and what is fantasy
Are you who you are or what you want to be

Your kind breeds conceit
Fact and fiction conceived
You don't know you only see
Words not deeds

A perceived perception or factual entity
All you know is who I'm supposed to be

Your kind breeds conceit
Fact and fiction conceived
You don't know you only see
Words not deeds

Adding more fuel to the lie that you fire
I'm living the truth while you're projecting a liar
