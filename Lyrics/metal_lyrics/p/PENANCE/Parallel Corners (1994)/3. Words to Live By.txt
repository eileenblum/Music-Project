[Music: Weston/Smail]
[Lyrics: Smail]

Cosmic pillars stand I'm my way
Shooting stars soon fall
Airtight blackness everywhere
You cry and I'm appalled

Vortex spins
Without fear
End of all
Is drawing near

Screaming shards rip into me
Others I can't feel
Lookin' 'round parallel corners
Distorting what is real

Hear your call
In the night
Right is wrong
And wrong is right

You talk in riddles I speak in rhyme
But yet the sun that never sets still ceases to shine
Reality fades in dreams of regret
I cannot remember but will never forget
The past is my present, the future's a lie
These are words to live by
