[Music: Weston/Smail]
[Lyrics: Smail/Weston]

From the inside looking out
Distorts what I'm about
Strains from emptiness
Change to bitterness
You have turned me
To what you thought I was
I don't care now
The past is now the past

The scars inside don't heal
The pain no more can I feel
I'm callous, alone, but unafraid
For better or worse I've changed

Product of what you've taught
You'll feel the things you thought
The path I now lead
Is wrath along with greed

Represent what I resent
You are all that I despise
Feeding from what I've become
Can't stop even if I tried

Glory bound or the fool crown
It's all just the same
I thank you now you showed me how
You've made my name
