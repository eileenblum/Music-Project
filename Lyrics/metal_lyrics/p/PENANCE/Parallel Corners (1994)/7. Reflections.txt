[Music: Weston]
[Lyrics: Smail]

Looking at changes beyond my control with hesitation
Setting in my life new goals - a liberation

Making my way blindly through life I see what I can
Sooner than later life takes its toll - a boy to a man

Wait - I see a chance at the window
Fate - mustn't always decide
I'll follow through with or without you
But I will be all right

Starting over isn't easy
It gets tougher every time, but to
Live and learn without getting burned
Is like not living at all
