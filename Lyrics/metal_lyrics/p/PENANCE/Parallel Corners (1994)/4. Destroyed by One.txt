[Music: Smail]
[Lyrics: Smail]

As I lay here my lifeblood is flowing
Can you feel all of the pain I'm knowing
Cannot understand but still I know feelings
Your frightful existence has me reeling
What importance do I hold for you
Just a status symbol of the things you do
You can rationalize your reasons
You can twist the twisted truth
To me that doesn't matter much
I'm hanging by your views
You cannot see the things I'd be
Or hear what I've to say
But you take it upon yourself
To take my life away

I can feel your pain
I'm to lose and you're to gain
The shape of things to come
Destroyed by one
Innocent and pure
Selfish thoughts are all too sure
Why must it end this way?
Where's my say?
