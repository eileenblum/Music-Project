[Music: Smail/Weston]
[Lyrics: Smail]

Life's so fast, got to make it last
You've got to let your feelings show
Don't have all the answers to cure life's cancer
I've been around enough to know

Life... another cross that we bear
Hope... amidst the pain and despair
Release your pain

World's a mess, we've got to do our best
Try and clot the world's wounds bleeding
We've got to fight, hard is the path to right
Winning's not worth it if it's easy

Life... another cross that we bear
Hope... amidst the pain and despair
Release your pain

I'm out in the world without a home
I'm scared but not alone
I don't know where to go
But I know where I'm going
It's got to be me and you
With a little love we can make it through
