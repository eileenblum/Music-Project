[Music: Weston/Freund]
[Lyrics: Smail]

Envisioned fear
I dream of you
My time is drawing near
To bring me through

Are you heaven sent?
Or a messenger from hell?
How can I tell?
How can I tell?

Sweetly smiling
Or mocking jest
Tenderly beguiling
As I await my final breath

This time I've crossed the line for good
Won't go back even if I could
Now I have all the answers
But I can't tell
