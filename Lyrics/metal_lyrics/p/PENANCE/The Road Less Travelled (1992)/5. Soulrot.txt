[Music: Lawrence]
[Lyrics: Lawrence]

I can't right my course 
Could it be any worse? 
Don't want to be, A slave to monotony 

A life without a dream is living a wasted life
No dream, no hope, no time, no wife
The longer the wait, the more the hesitancy 
Must get away soon or this place is the end of me

Ambition, Complacency 
Half full , Half empty
The watchful eyes, have guided me
But now is the time, to be free 
Optimism, my dear friend
Our life is mine, until the end 

Complicated course 
What could be the source
Don't want to think, Just want to sleep

Something calling and bringing me back again 
Sounds like music, who cares how and when 
A road less traveled that some can't find 
Don't look at me because the answer's inside 

Relations, Strained 
Half empty, Half drained
