[Music: Weston/Lawrence]
[Lyrics: Lawrence]

Hear me now, my tale to be told
Of dreams of greed and sins of old 
The tide breaks calm and closes in 
The sails catch wind my tale begins... 

Journey out to sea, Lust and greed follow me 
Ride the path to shame, Winds of deceit call my name 

Shipwreck of centuries old, Festival of long dead gold 
Innocents not long on life, But long to die for my pleasure 

Ahead lies the monstrosity 
Unveiled in glory for me to see 
So sad a fate so many should die 
But no more deserved for one such as I 

Footstep through the dread, Torn limbs and flesh now shred 
Gather together the jewels, From this ship of fools 

More lost souls rise from the depths of the sea 
And surround me on the shore 
"Gamble your soul for this chest of gold 
Or dwell with us now and forever more" 

I grab for life, a run for gold 
The wind's with me, the sails take hold 

I am the man, Who cheated death
With new found wealth, and tainted breath 

I hear the limbs scrape below 
Life breaks surface with death in tow 
And now I've learned too late to see 
I dwell below for now and eternity
