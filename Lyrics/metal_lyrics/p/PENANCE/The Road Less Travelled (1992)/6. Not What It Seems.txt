[Music: Weston/Smail]
[Lyrics: Lawrence]

You pretend to be my friend
But you can't make that which isn't real 
You fill your mind with facts 
But you will never get the feel 

It's not quite right 
You're not what you seem 
One part false 
Two parts obscene 

Back stabbing hypocrite
Won't let you scandalize my name
You want my confidence 
But no two things you say are ever the same

You're not quite right
It's not what it seems 
Social status
Human obscene 

Yours is no sacrifice
It's all a worthless slice 
Of conversation for the day 
Mine is paradise
Upon which there is no price 
Of that you mock and betray 

And you're telling me 
What it is I need
I don't have a clue
How can you? 

I know what's real 
Or at least I can feel 
Vengeance is mine 
In due time
