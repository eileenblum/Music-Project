[Music: Weston/Smail/Freund]
[Lyrics: Smail]

Sit and watch the world, I contemplate 
Existence ill legitimate, a quirk of fate
Is man of God or just Nature's folly 
Still with intelligence, we all are crawling

One step forward and two steps back 
Bring man's destined descent into black 

What does existence hold for me 
A mutation of what man conceives 
Did you ever step back and look at yourself 
You might not like what you see 

And with each dawn that brings a new day's breath
For most it means life, but for me it means death 

Man is a paradox drowning in irony 
The world is chained to man's reality

Can't you see 
It wasn't meant to be 
Not you or me
Humanity......You're killing me
