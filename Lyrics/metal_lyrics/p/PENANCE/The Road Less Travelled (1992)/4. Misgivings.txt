[Music: Smail]
[Lyrics: Smail]

Out of the blackness
Comes the saving light 
Lifts me on wings
To a dizzying height

I can't believe it 
I know I need it 

Revel in feelings 
Of borrowed time
Taking for granted 
The things I thought were mine 

Time is coming near 
The day that I fear

It's just a matter of time 

You give me feelings
I can't replace

Inevitable way
Darkness has its day
Like a child to the grave
My future is paved 

All I can do is wait...
