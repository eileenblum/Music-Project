Dusk kisses the nape of her neck and holds the night in its lovely hue
Skin mirrors the face of bright stars and leaves the day in unending rue.
Eyes swim with red torrid approach, but feign the sky with a caustic stare
Lips as full as the river in Spring quiver now in the greyish air.

She floats over water, brings her sorrow to ashen lips
Drinks grief from a ticking past that makes her sick.
Days stained with guileful innocence,
The wind kisses leaves, but brings no cogent recompense.

A sigh from the lips of her mouth now escapes
A blink from the lash of his eye now placates.

But the tears fall like rain spewed upon arid ground
And the storm cloaks the fervor of the love that abounds.

I sleep beneath a sky suffused with black
She whispered in my ear, "Will love be back?"

Wake in the weakening arms of future's hold
Stare in the frozen pond of dreams untold.
Sift through diurnal moods that impede sleep
Forced to endure the throes that vows do reap.

Please let me sleep in forever's grace,
Let me kiss the tears that stain your face.
Heal the wounds of mine that fester now,
Tend my wretched heart that beats somehow.

I sleep beneath damp earth
Your hand in mine.
She whispered in my ear,
"Our love conquered time."
