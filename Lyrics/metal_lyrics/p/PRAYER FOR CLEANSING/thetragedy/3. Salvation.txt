To all the people doing lines
Don't do it, don't do it
Inject your soul with liberty
It's free, it's free
To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
'Cause it's not, not what it seems
Oh no it's not, not what it seems

[Chorus:]
Salvation, Salvation, Salvation is free
Salvation, Salvation, Salvation is free

To all the parents with sleepless nights
Sleepless nights
Tie your kids home to their beds
Clean their heads
To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
'Cause it's not, not what it seems
No no it's not, not what it seems

[Chorus]
