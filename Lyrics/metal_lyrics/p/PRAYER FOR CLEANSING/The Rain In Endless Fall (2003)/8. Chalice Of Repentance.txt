Springtime of sorrow, make love last until the heart is dead
Frost on cracked glass, bleaching purity
Ride angels' wings into heaven, naked flesh a sick sight
Vomit into hair of sweat, feed myself on the lust of humanity
Devour orgasms of blood

Singing an ode of selfishness
Into a sea, putrid recognizance
A stench of sex so strong, taste it on my tongue
Sweet poison caressing taste buds until death

Decay - corrode from the inside out
Rot, melt away - the coating of security

Now and forever, burns numbers in my head
Cum to my senses, turn back the clock thrice

Realization of desperation
Suffer virgin flesh, suffer loneliness
Together rode the wings of demons right into hell
