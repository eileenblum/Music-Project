Suffocate in water graves
As I stare in disbelief, blood drains from open wrists
A silent prayer, concentrate on death's sweet kiss
For the pain is far too great and the love is far too late
To keep breath upon my lips

A World of flowers dead, a world of truth unsaid
Too many days alone
The Moonlight shines below, a sign to let me know
My soul is not my own

And dreams of happiness and dreams of all I wished
Together died in the depths of your abyss

To worry does no good for a death not understood
This life should not have been
The rain in endless fall, a cry to one and all,
Is death from suffering a sin?

A whisper in my ear takes hold my deepest fear
The tomb beckons my name
For once the cut is made, a slice of cold steel blade
Air and ground feel not the same

Words torment, inscribed in sin, actions are brisk, bring final end
Water turns red, turns life to dust, dust is nothing, darkness left
Mourners in black, laugh at the wake, treason of love, dead heart now aches
Solace....alone....forever
