A notion of devine right
One life the pinnacle of all
A vision of perfection
By way of noble bloodlined birth
Whispers of self-justification
Provide constant assurance of authority

Continuance with burnt offering
Sacrifice to the altar of bloodlust, Culture
The essence of innocence flawed by corruption
An angel in thine own eyes - a devil in thine own right
A bloodfed atrocity hailed as the paradigm of civility

Which is the savage beast?
Is it instinct? Death as a necessity of survival?
Rather a simple act of domination
Murderous pride in development as beauty dies

Tears soak the tainted soil
Cried to germinate a hope for the growth of compassion
Violence becoming a salve for the effects of...violence
How does it end?
Does our lofty vision fade into earth?

A fall from grace, from our seeming seraphic stature?
Or do we rebuild? A new foundation for the future

Our choice fast approaches
Acceleration to a possible apocalyptic end
With hope of emergence of humanistic inner beauty
I prepare for the assured destiny of culture
