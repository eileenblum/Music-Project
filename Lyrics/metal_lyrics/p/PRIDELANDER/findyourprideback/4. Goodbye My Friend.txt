When the rain goes.
The sky is turning bright
But it's never for long.

Can't you see.
What we've done each other
It's always ended by the long long fight

Keep tryna hold each other heart and heart.
But nothing else than just a war
We're just the victims in the night and night.
And not a word left but goodbye.

We both know.
We'll never be alright
When we are together

We both know.
That we had tried so hard
Making all the things to meet


Goodbye. Goodbye.
The only thing that makes me feel alright
Goodbye. Goodbye.
And I know that I'll never see you again
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Then you can go away tonight
So goodbye, goodbye, my friendâ¦
