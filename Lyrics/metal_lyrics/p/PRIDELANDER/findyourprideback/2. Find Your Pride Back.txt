You're feeling lost and nothing seems a hope
Not a single note will sound just right
This empty life takes you to a heavy cloud
And closing all the chance that you can get at all.

Can't you see we're always by your side
Just make believe you'll never be alone
To face another day and don't be scared
'Cause you're the one who'll sing that song again, and again.

Fight the hard life you must do
And fight the loneliness in you
To find the unknown ways that might bring you to get your pride comes back!
Life's too short to cry again
And life's too wide to travel more
Then find your pride and never stop!

Now it's time for you to try
Don't be scared of a winding road
Life will find a way, my friend
And let's shout for everything now with your roar!

Now it's time for you to fly
Some people can't wait no more
Find your pride again, my friend
And let's do for everything now with your best!

Forever.
