We arrive in the middle of nowhere
We confuse there's nothing we can do
We can't see no candle light in to the night
All the darkness is coming down and down

We arrive in the middle of nowhere
We confuse there's nothing we can do for more
We can't see no candle light in to the night
All the darkness is coming down and down again

Fight is a must for the right in our heart with a try.
Ah. Ah.

Fight is a must for the right in our heart with a try
Do it now.
And we fly.

Right.
The way's on our hands, let's forget the past.
Don't look back again, it's time for us to run.
Reaching out the days, together we will jump!
Here we are "Best Friend Forever"

Jump! Here we are. And,
Jump! Here we are. So,
Jump! Here we are.

"Best Friend Forever"
