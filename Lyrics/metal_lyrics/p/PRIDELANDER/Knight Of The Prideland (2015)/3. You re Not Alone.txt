When the night is getting dark. And when the sky is full of clouds
And the heavy wind start to blow your mind

When you're down all alone. And really down in the night
Not a single word seems to hear alright

All you need to live is just call your friend
And I'll be there and finding your heart

Find hope and just think of me
Call my name again and again
Life will lead you to find away
Take my hand and we're gonna make all night
Seems bright again

Song.

Take your breath deep inside
Close your eyes and scream it out loud
Dry your tears on my shoulder
Grab my hands and we're gonna make all night
Seems bright again

'Cause you're not alone..
