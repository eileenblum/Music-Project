Fly. Fly high.
Through the air of the prideland
They're hunting all the moved things on the ground. Now.
Fly. Ascend.
With the fire in their throats
To burning out the people on the prideland

We keep attacking on the battlefields
With all of our sweat and blood we do not care.
Keep fighting for the people's right
For our land and lives

Keep facing on the danger zone
With all our hearts in this bloody war.
'Til the end of power
And you come out with big sword
Your sacrifice for salvation.

You're the one to fight the dragon
You're the one to grab the glory
You're the pridelander's knight
For our dreams and our hope

You're the man who can ride on
You're the man who can fly on
You're the knight who will lead us
To retake the prideland
