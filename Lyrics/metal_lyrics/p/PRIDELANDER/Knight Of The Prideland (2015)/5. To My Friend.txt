Thank you my friend for everything you gave to me
The awesome friendship and loyalty from you to me

Now you have to go, faraway from home
To find out something new, to get a better life.

Now you have to go, faraway from home
To find out something new, to get a better life.

You know it's hard for me, to let you go away
So let's dry up all the tears, my friend.

Goodbye, goodbye.
Good luck my friend
So long, until we meet again.
