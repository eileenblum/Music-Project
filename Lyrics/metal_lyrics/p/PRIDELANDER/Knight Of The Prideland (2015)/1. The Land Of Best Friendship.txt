See the stars always bright
See those mountains so high
Throw all the past away
Raise the future together

Call the dragons out loud
So they can come and get us
Ride together and fly
Feel and see the promise land

Take my hands you'll feel how much I miss you guys
Take a ride you'll see how much I care for you
All the gorgeous matter between us, hey guys
I'll never let you go away, no more

Guys, join us tonight
Hey guys, let's take all the chance, alright
Open up all of your heart and mind so wide
We'll be there and you'll never be alone
We'll be there, you'll never be alone

So trust me, guys.
