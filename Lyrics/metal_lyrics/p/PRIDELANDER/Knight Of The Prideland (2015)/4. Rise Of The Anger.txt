Started by the unknown problem seems we do not care
Growing up so fast lead us to the worst way out
Incited by the black voices from the darkest night. Get into our vein.

Like a wave of ghosts spreads out fast, oh really fast
The time of silence has past, with a hatred in the eyes
Men screamed for an anger, men fought, battling now. Sprang up in to the night.

Whispered by an evil we don't know it comes from nowhere
Driven by a power which is coming from Satan
Looking for a trouble, searching out a bloody war. Only for the glory.

Rise of the anger, burns out our hearts
With no forgiveness, to all human life [2x]
'Til the end.

No where to run. No place to hide
They are coming for you. They are coming to destroy
Avenge now. Attack now. Hahahahaha.

We are on fire of the fight. Violence sounds at night
The war is too blind to know that it's not right
We are on fire of the fight. It's time to kill them all
To burn them all right now.

Ooh too far. We kill somebody else. Something bad we'll regret for
The gateway of evil. Is open now too wide. And never stop burning our hearts
