[Lyrics: AA Nemtheanga, music: O Floinn and Primordial]

What desolate walls are these
That rise up from the ruins
Hymns to a forgotten age
in centuries of strong sleep
What seiges, storms and fire
have they resisted in the deep

Where lie the tomb of Gods
Tongues of the occident
Their magic is hidden in shame
Resting entombed within these ancient halls

Thou, Sail on, O' ship of fate
Sail on so strong and great
Humanity with all it's fears
With all the hopes of future years
is hanging breathless on thy fate

Where lie the Gods of old
men and women who jell from peace
The battle has carved another season
on a haggard and defeated jade
