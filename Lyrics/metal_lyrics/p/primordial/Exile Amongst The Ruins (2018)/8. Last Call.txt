[Lyrics: AA Nemtheanga, music: Macuilliam and Primordial]

Awake in another city at 5 am
The breath of day upon my neck
Coveting the hours before I wake
Another me from his sleep
To give back the things I take

How hard we tried to tear this world down
Mu duty was to futility
The unwilling hand of beauty
Which left us seeking negativity

We were seeking ruin
Out on the outskirts of another dead end town
Trying to find some truth in the maze

The lines on our faces grow deeper
So step up to the gallows and hand me
Out to try one last time

What do we do to save ourselves
Who can reach out to save us?
We made our bed and let it lie
And to think all we did
Was waiting around to die
The powder hurts us but we still try
To lie to ourselves finding reasons why
We try to find reasons why
