[Lyrics: AA Nemtheanga, music: MacUilliam and Primordial]

How many lies would
We have to live
Before we escape the hands
The hands of time
That stole our best years
Where the decades might
Breathe a little less
A little less of the
Night

Step bravely out into
The city lights tonight
Sweet blood is coursing
Through our veins
Darkness it pulls so tight
Around us
Antidotes to all
Our years of pain
