[Lyrics: AA Nemtheanga, music: O Floinn and Primordial]

Make no mistake
The arrow I've drawn is for you
I've been slaspening it's point
My whole life and my aim is true
They say the war is lost
But this battle you will lose

Your foolish heart
It poisons the well
We knew the war was lost
And sang every empire fell

There's thunder in our hearts
But too much hate for the ones we love
All against all, from such wounds
We seed mighty oaks
No ocean too vast or conquest small
To met the blade of tyranny

Your foolish heart
It poisons the well
We celebrate the final days
And see you all in hell
