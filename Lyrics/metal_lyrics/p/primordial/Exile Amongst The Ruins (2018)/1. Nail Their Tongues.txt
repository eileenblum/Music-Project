[Lyrics: AA Nemtheanga, music: MacUilliam and Primordial]

If you are the son of Adam
Then I am the rock of Cain
To your Abel

To cast the tone of sin
In your arms
And bring a poison chalice to the table

Oh Luther did you know you were able
to piece the tongues of liars
The gospel of ruin from the heretics age
Strait from the mouth of fire

A lone martyr on the hill of perdition
Broken flesh that many traitors confess
A document in the blood of sedition
Blasphemed lead from the printers press

Oh Luther did you know you were able
to piece the tongues of liars
The gospel of ruin from the heretics age
Strait from the mouth of fire

This papacy of devout
Stinking eye to heaven
Oh death were is thy sting
Oh grief were is thy victory
Oh light you are a shining pawn
Oh Lucifer did you know did you see
