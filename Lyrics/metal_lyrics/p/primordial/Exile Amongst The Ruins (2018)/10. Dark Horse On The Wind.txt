[Limited Edition Track]All those who died for liberty have heard the eagle scream
All the ones who died for liberty have died but for a dream
Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
For in no nation on earth more broken dreams you'll find

The flames leapt high, reached to the sky 'til they seared a nation's soul
In the ashes of our broken dreams we've lost sight of our goal
Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
And help our hearts seek RÃ³isÃ­n, our soul again to find

Now charlatans wear dead men's shoes, aye and rattle dead men's bones
'Ere the dust has settled on their tombs, they've sold the very stones
Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
For in no nation on the earth more Pharisees you'll find

In grief and hate our motherland her dragon's teeth has sown
Now the warriors spring from the earth to maim and kill their own
Oh then rise, rise, rise, dark horse on the wind
For the one-eyed Balor still reigns king in our nation of the blind
