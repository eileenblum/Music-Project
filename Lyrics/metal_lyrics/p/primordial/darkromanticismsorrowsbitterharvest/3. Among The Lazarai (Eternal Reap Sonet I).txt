Ceremonial beauty beneath a bitter moon
Perditious souls danse their danse
Winter withered silence were once my tomb
In eternal frost, a dark romance
Listen, such angels of the end do weep
As knowledge comes for those who watch ever
Wrapped beneath the boughs of fateless sleep
Dismal dreams of paradise come never
The sky shall flow as waterfalls of distress
I, wandered in the midst of shades
O' heaven sent mysteries of hell's caress
Blind my eyes before my vision fades
I have envisaged the harvest moon
The summer of eternal reap
...has come...

Solomon's wisdom
Anastasis Christou
The harvest shall come
Ride the red dawn

Thralldom...
In repentent paths
Iconoclasm...
Opens new gates for you

"I will strike at the shepherd,
And the sheep will be scattered"

Turn my blood to wine
And I will drink to you
Open my veins for your soul
Light blind my eyes

I built my
Gallows with
Such a visionary
Conquest...
Conquerer of
Such perversion
As to remain
Unameable...
