I am the eye of the storm
Axis Mundi, I fall to my knees
I've realised my dark dreams, father
I have become... I spread my seed
Have I not brought you to these
Ends of the earth that I defy
No effigy shall fail me now
And no voice from the sky, shall deny me

I rode the four hate winds
From where I came, I could not name
I hear the colours and see the sounds
I arose from the east, and plagued
The lands of the same... I had no need
Of incantation, or enchantmant
You brought the end upon your world
Our world has no end... your's
Has just begun... now is torment

Now is forever... destiny unfurled
