We are falling over the ends of the earth
So gather your children before you
And tell them that these are the final days of all
And preach to the paupers

And sing to the slaves

I see you've chosen to loose your faith
To burn your bridges and lose your way
From mountain top to valley deep
From shore to cursed shore
What nation, what state, what land is this?

The wretched tribe of Nero...
Tribe of Nero...

Sing, sing, sing to the slaves
Sing to the slaves that Rome burns

Are our bones not dust, our blood not poison?
On my knees in the black light
Searching for salvation, bitter redemption

So throw your dice and cast your shadow
You may look away, but your children will not...
