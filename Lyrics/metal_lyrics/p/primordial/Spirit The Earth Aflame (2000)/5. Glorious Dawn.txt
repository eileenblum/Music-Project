For those who may Rise 
As a Phoenix from the Ashes 
For those who may Devour 
The Fruits of Knowledge 
For those who coil 
Serpent like, with cyclical Grace 
...For those as Wolves among Sheep 
who Sharpen their Teeth 
for the last Supper 

For those who are the Rock 
Upon which our Fortress built 
For those who are the Anvil 
Upon which our will is Forged 

For those whose Deeds 
shall become Song 
and for those whose Eyes 
Shall light up the heavens 
With a single Fiery Glance 
This ....is your season 

"Of cyclical rebirth and regeneration...the serpent 
who eats his own tail. Of the Word, the Mind, and 
the Will that makes Flesh. This is our Season..."
