Seems we are to live our final days 
Far from the dwellings of men 
As flowing tides and shifting sands 
Far from the bitter gaze of soul less man 

In sorrow we fly from our loved ones 
To die in the waters of the wild 
My brethren can seek no shelter beneath these wings 
Until dead men rise from their graves 

How sad it is for me to see 
My fathers fallen halls 
Here once prideful men clashed as Gods 
With veins aflame and hearts of thunder 

Yet my fathers are long since dead and gone 
And I with heart so heavy 
And limbs so weary 
It seems our sun is all but dimmed 

And we your children have 
Wandered for years 
And felt the cruel blast of freezing winds 
But the harshest blow of all to come... 

To return at last to an empty home 

"Adapted and altered from the Irish folklore tale 
of the Children of Lir, turned to swans and condemned 
to roam for 300 years before returning home...to an empty 
home. An interesting spine for an allegorical tale. One of 
displacement, disenchantment and alienation...from this world 
and its ways. Longing for another Age... 
another time, another place..."
