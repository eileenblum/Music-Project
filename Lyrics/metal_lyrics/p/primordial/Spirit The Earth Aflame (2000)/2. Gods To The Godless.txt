I have one Desire 
let it be 
a Pestilence upon your lands 
a Plague upon all your houses 
it is my wish 
to Enslave all your people 
The soil enriched with their Blood 
To Burn your places of Worship 
Our Gods shall become your Gods 

All that lives on the vine is rotten 
may your wines be foul 
and your bread as the flesh of the dead 
an ill wind to bring nought but decay 
and the stench of your Slaughtered kin 

The newborn, borne with fear in their eyes 
and slavery in their limbs 
as tools to build a new Empire 
We are your cross to bear 
Perhaps you shall be a martyred people 
But as sure as the Night follows the Day 
...a Dead People 

"The desire to sweep away what is sacred and profane. 
To enforce and embrace Tragedy...to imbed it deep 
within the subconscious of generations..."
