"I have crossed the seas, I have left cities behind me, 
and I have followed the source of rivers towards their 
source or plunged into forests, always making for other 
cities. I have had women, I have fought with men ; and 
I could never turn back any more than a record can spin 
in reverse. And all that was leading me where ? 
To this very moment..." 
[Jean Paul Sartre "Nausea"]

I sink below the waves 
is this what I've been looking for ? 
it seems 
I've found someone to die for 
someone to lie for... 

I've drunk my fill of misery 
it's time to move on 
Restless and forgiving 
it will lead me to the Grave 

Let's leave for other worlds 
leave the future behind 
Here...my will has been spent 
Let us depart 
Before the night steals upon us 
The Wretchedness of another day 

"The wish, the want, to stay in the dream state, 
can leaving this mortal coil be seen as a new 
departure?, or a return to a permanent dream state ? 
To feel to never want to wake. For here my will has 
Been spent..."
