Dawn's cold passion filters through the trees
In darkness I showed you ecstasy
In darkness I took you from this world
Light shall never fall upon your face again

From spring I've waited for this winter's reap
I've watched you pass autumn's twilight yearning

Now with dawn I bring you eternal sleep
And silence all forever mourning...

Your blood looked so beautiful in the snow
I cried like a child...
All my life I waited for you
And with dusk's onset... I lay with you...

A cold embrace
A winter's kiss
Frozen blood upon my lips...
