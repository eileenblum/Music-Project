Lilith my bride... a love of sin so deep
Wounds of lust won't ever heal
Stigmata... I yearn for thy crimson taste
Rape my senses... upon your cross I'll weep
But shall this longing I ever satiate

I writhe, I twist... convulse in ecstacy
Bring me to ritual, bring me to life
Fornicate, profanate, procreate... spawn of he who am I
Eternity, for your touch I'll pay

It is nights as black as this that have made me
Am I to pay the wage of sin...?
Beyond the stars a fire shall burn for me
I turn my face to a new age...
Lucifer... what tidings doth thou bring?
