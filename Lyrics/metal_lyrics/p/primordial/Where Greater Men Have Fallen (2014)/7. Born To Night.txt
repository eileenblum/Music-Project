Maybe you tried to gather the world in your arms
Pushed my words aside and sought fiery revelation
Martyrs seem in good company, but they are alone
As the day we made them, so hold your tongues
And steal pride's pleasure

My lack of faith, was not wanted here
You want your tragedy for your own ends
As martyrs we are born to die

Like Agrippa we poured, over the secrets of life
Into the long hours and buried our hearts
And even then I knew I could not save you
You gazed into the abyss and it gazes back at you 
And now more than half of my life is through
I have saved the least for last and it is for you
