What I lack in speed, I make up with efficiency. Although the former seems to be what matters to you. And though I take up much less space, Iâm the one whoâs in your way? Guess my digital response to your one note protest is as primitive as my mode of transportation. Just press your magic pedal, and fume into the sunset. I donât want to smell your muffler.
