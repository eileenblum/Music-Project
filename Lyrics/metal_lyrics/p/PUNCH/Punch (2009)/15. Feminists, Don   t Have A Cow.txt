Like apples to oranges, both fruitful. Two eyes, two ears, two ovaries too. Thatâs where we draw the line, and itâs the differences that give us an excuse. No words to resist. Canât write without a thumb. How can she say she doesnât want this done? And every thirteen months, until sheâs no good, given what will only be taken away to the same fate, or a veal crate. All for the precious by product. If you wouldnât want your mother, sister, friend, as a milk and baby factory, donât let it happen in your name to a creature with two eyes, two ears, two ovaries.
