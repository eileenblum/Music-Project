Struggling to remember how I felt at the time. An evolution of understanding that hasnât progressed very far. Sickening feeling that I should have seen it coming. That I did, but didnât want to see it coming. Does that mean I could have done more? I think your mind was made up. Another bystander. The movie you were playing, the songs in your head. This was no reunion. No stars were aligned that day. In a dream I saw you. You said you were all alone. Sharp these words; they stayed with me. In the end, I know theyâre true.
