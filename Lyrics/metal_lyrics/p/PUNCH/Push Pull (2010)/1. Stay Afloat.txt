Outside of my control. Outside of myself. Your problems are not my own. But old habits die hard. Days of coming home to the unknown left a mark. Trying to hold it all together was too much responsibility. This guilt is all Iâve known. I bet if you attach a tug boat to a sinking ship they are both going down. Itâs hard enough to stay afloat alone.
