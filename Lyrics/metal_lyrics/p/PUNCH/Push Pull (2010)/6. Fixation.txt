My frustration lies in watching this habitual round and round. Excuses made for your behavior will now fall on deaf ears. Itâs not a phase if it lasts a lifetime. If you canât admit whatâs broken, it will never be fixed. Until you have the capacity to say Iâm sorry, donât say anything to me at all. This may be thicker than water but Iâm still drowning.
