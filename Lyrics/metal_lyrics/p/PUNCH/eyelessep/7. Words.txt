A war of words.
Just pick a side.
Us or them?
Right or wrong?
But if you're not with us
You hate freedom
and everything that goes along.
There's no other option.
But they're just words.
No one gets hurt.
No one important anyway.
Can't you see?
It's a game.
They'll find someone to blame.

we will never back down
we know we are right
soon you'll see our side
