Where does it come from?
Where does it go?
The store, and then the garbage.
Before or after that doesnât concern me.
I know there will always be more.
This cornucopia that you see is actually quite fragile,
and everything we buy is set to undermine us.
Maybe the hole that youâre trying to fill won't seem so big
if you forget how youâve been trained.
Do more than just consume.
