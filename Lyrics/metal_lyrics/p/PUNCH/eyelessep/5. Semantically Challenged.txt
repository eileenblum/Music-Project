Itâs easy to throw words around,
if you donât know quite what they mean.
morally wrong or bad, immoral, wicked,
harmful, injurious.
Characterized or accompanied by misfortune or suffering.
Unfortunate, disastrous.
Due to bad conduct or character.
That all sounds so familiar.
Iâm just confused which side weâre on.
