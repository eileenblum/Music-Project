I hear that it's impossible.
What do you eat?
Aren't you unhealthy?
You need more protein!
I know it's hard to chew,
but the excuses that are offered
I just can't swallow.
Just because you can do something
that doesn't mean that you should.
The trick is you have to find
the difference between what's accepted
and what's right.
