Howâd you like to cut the beak off a chick?
Keep it in a small dark cage?
Artificially impregnate a cow?
Skin it while itâs still alive?
Kill it at a fifth of its life span, and feed it back to other cows?
Youâre off the hook.
You can get animal products without having to get your hands dirty.
Wonât cost you an arm and a leg,
as all conceivable corners have been cut.
Itâs just the companiesâ way of showing that they care.
Theyâve handled everything,
so that you can buy meat,
and not have to think about how it fucking got there.
