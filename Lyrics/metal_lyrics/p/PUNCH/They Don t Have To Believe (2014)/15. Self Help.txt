I know you can't be happy, but you won't make a change. You ask me to hold my judgment, but I just want to hold your hand. I try to be supportive but I'll never understand. Help me help yourself. I want to make it better. I ant to ease your pain. I'll do anything for you just help me, help yourself.


Thanks to dddesert.ps3 for sending track #2 lyrics.
