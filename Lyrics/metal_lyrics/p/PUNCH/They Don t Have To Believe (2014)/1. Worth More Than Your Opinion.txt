You probably donât have to worry when you walk out your door. Will you be judged? Will you get comments? Will you get stares? Will you feel helpless? will you be followed? You've got to walk in pairs. Donât we have anything else to offer? You only see the surface. Your unwanted opinion is worthless, but not harmless. Our looks, our bodies, are none of your fucking business. We donât exist for you to appraise, not a compliment, no fucking thanks.
