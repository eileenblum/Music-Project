I can only bite my tongue so long until my mouth is full of
blood. Resentment built into a wall, over which we
could never clearly see. There was never any room to
just be you and me. It got worse before it got better, but
friendship will take us further, than hatred ever could.
I can only bite my tongue so long -
Until my mouth is full of blood.
