I never thought I'd leave this place; city of birth. 12 long years, and 6 generations home. But I'd rather walk out on my own two feet than be forced to leave. I'm sure you won't miss another person who "underachieves". Why is success measured only by your shallow standards? I wish I had the strength to stay but I can't bear to see your face.
