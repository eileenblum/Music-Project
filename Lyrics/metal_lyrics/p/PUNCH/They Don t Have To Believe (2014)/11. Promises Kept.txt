Not giving up, feel like I'm giving out. Filling days with empty voices, promises kept, words unspoken. It's only temporary - waiting for forever.
Passing days and killing time, waiting for what's missing. I never needed anyone before but now I'm not sure I can do this on my own. It's only temporary. Waiting for forever.
