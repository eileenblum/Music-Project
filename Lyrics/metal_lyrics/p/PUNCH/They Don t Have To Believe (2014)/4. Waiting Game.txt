Waiting game. One more hour, one more day, years go past. A lot has changed but it feels the same. What's around the corner, what's around the bend? I swear that I'll be ready for whatever's at the end. I'm done waiting for today to start when I'm scared that tomorrow is falling apart. I'm sick of starting again, my mind is snapping when it used to end. Waiting for a difference, could never end.
