No I'm not sorry, I won't apologize for salty water and reddened eyes. This doesn't make me weak, it makes me honest. I can't live a life of lies. No I'm not sorry, I won't apologize for salty water and reddened eyes. This doesn't make me me crazy, it makes me human. I can't live a life that's not mine. Undermine me; undermine me, just so you can win a fight. Don't show your emotions? What a fucking life. This doesn't make me weak, it makes me human. I won't live a life of lies.
