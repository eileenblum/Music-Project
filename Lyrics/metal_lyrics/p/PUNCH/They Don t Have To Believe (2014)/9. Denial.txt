A secret you're keeping, but only from yourself. Carefully guarded, but only in your mind. Though I scream it out, though I tell the world, you're the only one who needs to listen. No greater betrayal than denying yourself. You're pushing us away, and it's time to push back. A secret you're keeping but only from yourself. Carefully guarded, but only in your mind.
