No matter how they fight today,
No matter how much honor theyâll display.
Weâll dominate.

Spells of war,
Hear my call,
Help me take them down.

Theyâll hear my deadly last whisper,
right before they die.

This melody seeks a new victim,
Let it penetrate their mind.

I will revive, one more life, 
to ignite them all,

And their barriers will crumble,
under all of my force,

theyâll fall,
lets make them crawl.

And when we finally meet their king,
There will be no ghost for him,
We shall end it all.
