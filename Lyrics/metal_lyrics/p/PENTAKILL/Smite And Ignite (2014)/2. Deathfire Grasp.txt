Fighting shadows,
in their haunting guise.

Smiting the wicked baron,
and unleash my might.

When we face our final hour,
in the darkest rift.

Come what ever may,
Iâll be the death of you.

After channeling my power,
Your end will be swift.

Now thereâs nothing in my way,
Youâll feel my deathfire grasp!

Clashing minions,
ravaged fields of war.

Manifest my dominion,
total chaos restored.
