You were the one that I ran to when I was child
You gave me sunshine and laughter and hope for a while
Always beside me, a shoulder to cry on
But you were a spider creeping inside of me
Watching my every move, saying you know me well
I learned to fear you and your strange devotional

We grew in hate and despair
Every concealing emotion was spent
Your words were poisonous air
And I recoiled from the love that was meant

But there was a time, when I could have loved you
The moon on the mountain shone only for you
There was a time, when I could have loved you
I could have been true, the moon on the mountain for you

You were the thorn in my side, my ribbon of red
You said you'd leave me alone but you stayed in my head
You said that you'd kill me if I ever let you down
But you were trading my secrets all over town
Tried to forgive you and see things in your domain
But you were subtle and ruthless in your cold game

I could not have been more trusting
Oh I loved you, I could not take anymore

But like any moon I wax and wane
I'm fickle when I choose to rise into the sky

Yes there was a time, when I could have loved you
The moon on the mountain shone only for you
There was a time, when I could have loved you
I could have been true, the moon on the mountain for you
