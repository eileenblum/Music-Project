Spring time, that's the way it goes
Don't forget we stole everything and nothing from the earth
Winter, came to us in time
Shadows and thought crimes
Don't display the colours of your birth

Didn't they tear you down my yellow rose?
Didn't they baby?
Didn't they poison everything that grows?
Didn't they baby?

And when the summer ends, I feel you next to me
I sense your tethered limbs still longing to be free
My yellow rose

I could say it's not like that but memory betrays
Everyone who dares to speak too soon
I would tell you about it but I can't reason with
The tiny child within my past

And when the summer ends, I feel you next to me
I sense your tethered limbs still longing to be free
And with each winter's breath I see you in my dreams
I know without your death I never can be free

Hold it down and keep it together
Hold it down, it can't be forever

Memory betrays anyone who dares to speak too soon
