Walk a little faster baby, you know I love to hunt you
Love to feel your body breaking and every sinew shaking
Move a little slower maybe and I'll forget to need you
Never stray from the path like I said

The skin which I live in burns every moment
I will not give in though I must go
On and on, this world keeps pushing me
It won't be long before I break inside of you

You can throw me away
You can beg me on your knees to stay
You can leave on your own
But I know you want your love to bring me home
You can dance on my grave
You can say that I am just your slave
You can break every bone
But I know you want your love to bring me home

Think a little quicker baby and I'll forgive you for it
Love your heartless selfishness how you don't give a shit
Cut a little deeper darling, the blood will surely drown us
Never stray from the path like I said

Who are you to say we're through?
Who gets the last laugh? Who will rise anew?
Who are you to say we're through?
Who gets the last laugh? Baby it's not you

On and on and on and on
I know you want your love to bring me home
