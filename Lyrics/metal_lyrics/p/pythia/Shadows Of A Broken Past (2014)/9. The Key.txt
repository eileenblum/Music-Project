Push, pull, you're the fool
You're the one who knows it all
Every day you walk away
Just to find you're here to stay

You're up, down, going round
Never find some middle ground
Live your life inside a cage
Only you had time to make

There's a door inside this lonely room
That should it be denied becomes a tomb

Look inside your beating heart
There's the key to set you free
Shadows of a broken past
Let it be and you will find the key

Tall tale, full of lies
Never find you're satisfied
Dancing on the thinnest ice
Naughty now and then so nice

You're here, there, everywhere
Never time to stop and stare
Live your life a broken queen
Kingdom built inside a dream

Look inside your beating heart
There's the key to set you free
Shadows of a broken past
Let it be and you will find the key
There's a path of yellow gold
Leading to a better place
Take my hand it holds the key
Hold it tight the secret is in me

Bitter is the heart that wanders
Locked inside an empty room
You will never find salvation
Lost inside a lonely tomb
