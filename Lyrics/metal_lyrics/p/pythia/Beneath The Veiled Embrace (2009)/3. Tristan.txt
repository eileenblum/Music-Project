I dreamt last night that you were here again,
Tristan do you remember the death of love?

I can see clearly the past
when you called me your child
Rose from the tomb of my heart
to be crush by his light

Dark lord hold me
You control me
You should know me
By my faithful heart
Tristan

How we would dance in the shadows
So cast by the moon
Master have pity your
Child needs you blistering heat

Dark lord hold me
You control me
You should know me
By my faithful heart
Tristan

Will you return to your daughter
who burns for your touch?
Father each drop of the blood
in my veins is for you.

Dark lord hold me
You control me
You should know me
I am faithful
