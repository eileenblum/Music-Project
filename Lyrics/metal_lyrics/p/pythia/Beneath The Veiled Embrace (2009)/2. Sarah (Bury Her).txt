Iâve been in perjury
Iâve been in chains for oh so many years
And itâs a mystery
How this neglect can bring me ever near.

You are a sanctuary, but must agree
You never give yourself
And I cannot compete with Sarah

No I cannot compete with Sarah

She was the one who never broke your heartstring
She was the virgin in an icy tomb
Didn't she say that it would last forever?
But when she fell she broke a thousand hearts for you

Marry me or bury me to.

Now it is clear to me
That you are just a soul whoâs in despair
Youâre never cruel to me
because I feel youâre never really there

I should have closed this door
Left long before I ever heard her name
For I cannot compete with Sarah

No I cannot compete with Sarah

You have to give more
