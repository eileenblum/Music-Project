It's a weakness, it's a sickness
It's the very core of what we do
It's a story of a heart beat
But the end is not complete with

Oh baby please
Don't put your hands on me
They're cold and unease
The very nature of me

And I want you and I need you
But it's not over till I sleep

Full moon rising
Where should we begin?
(In suffering)

There was something in the darkness
Something so wild and undefined
It was hunger, drew me to you
But the end was never about

Oh baby please
Don't be so cruel to me
It's not this disease
That breaks each bone in me

So be careful what you wish for
For it is never what you need

What you wish for will be granted
All your dreams will be enchanted
