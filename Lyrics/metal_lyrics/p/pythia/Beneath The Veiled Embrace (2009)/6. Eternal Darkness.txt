Oh my dreamer
Will you not be stronger now?
My hearts is broken
I have waited patiently for you

Oh my heart break
Will you never set me free?
I long to heal you.
I will sacrifice myself to you

Surely it is not for angels
To be bleeding for the hearts
Of others who are worthy of
The blackest flames?
Eternal Darkness

All these memories
And I still have learnt from nothing
I would chance it
I would love you if you only could

I will love you till I die, until my body
Is a sancturay for worms
