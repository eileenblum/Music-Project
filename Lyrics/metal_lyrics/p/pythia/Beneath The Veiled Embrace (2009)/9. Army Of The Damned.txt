We are the army of the damned
Men of a far forgotten land
Thousands of years have passed us by
And still you will hear our cry

We left our homes to fight this war
We don't remember what twas for
Still we advance both day and night
Until the time comes to fight

And so they flee from us, our kindred and our kin
They will not stand for us and all that we have been
The blood will flow from us forever and a day
Our oaths are broken by their sins

We gave up all that we could give
So that our children could but live
We march forever to the drum
Of battle that will not come

We hear our lovers cry, through they are dead and gone
We hear our comrades sing that everlasting son
We cannot feel the sun though morning has just come
We are but shadows of the past

Will we find forgiveness, will we?

Have mercy on us Father forgive all these men
Who cannot feel the sun though morning has just come
We are but shadows of the past.

We are the army of the damned
Me of a far forgotten land
What I would give to see her face
And love her once more
