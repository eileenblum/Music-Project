Oh where you are from 
You think it's better than here
But you are wrong
Maybe I'm not being clear

All games that start in the night
End at the edge of a cliff
And you won't even fight
But bruise and withdraw like a fist

Crawling around on you knees
And you think you're first

The blade of the beast 
Is a mighty fine spirit to host

All you dreams are sold 
You and your counterfeit life

You won't be told 
But you're just kissing the knife

Oh where you are from
I'm not surprised that you're ill
It's been too long
To ever find God in a pill

All dreams that start with a blade
End with a noose round your wrist
And you always betrayed you heart
With a cold blooded kiss

Baby that's one thing 
I've got that you'll never have
Baby that's one thing I've got

All your dreams are sold
You and your counterfeit life
You won't be told
But you're just kissing the knife
