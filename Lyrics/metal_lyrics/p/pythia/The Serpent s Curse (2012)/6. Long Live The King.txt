I heard the dragon call his name
And I didn't like the sound
Never thought he'd feel such pain
Never thought to drag him down

But the story was a lie
And it's killing us inside
So we stand against his pride
We can never run and
Hide from the dragon
Bury it's selfish needs
Hide from the dragon
Bury it's lawless deeds

Long Live The King
We will remember
That every moment we are
Running our of time

Long live the king
We will remember
Long live the king
Long live the king

I heard the dragon had his way
And I shed a tear for us
For the years he had to pay
For the strength and love and trust

Stand true mighty warriors of the condemned

(There's no reason to be frightened
We're just passing through the lightning)
