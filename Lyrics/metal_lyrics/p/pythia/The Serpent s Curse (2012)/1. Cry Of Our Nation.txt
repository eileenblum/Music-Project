There's no beginning there will be no end
'Til every enemy becomes a friend
The will fall on the battlefield that we defend
To the cry of our nation

There's something in the air 
Something strange and ever magical
Can you feel it in child
The thunder is the banging of the drums
We will freeze you with our stare
We will steal you blood and bone 
When the Serpent Queen commands
She will haunt you with my moan 

God will not save you from the throne 
God will not save you

There's no beginning there will be no end
'Til every enemy becomes a friend
The will fall on the battlefield that we defend
To the cry of our nation

It's only make believe 
It's only in the dreams of every child
That we learn to breathe,
To share our lonely prison of denial
We will strike at every heart,
That abandons us to pain
We will make you sing out loud
We will wash away your shame

God will not save you from the flame
God will not save you

Oh peace will come to those who wait
Love will fly away
Peace will come
To those who wait

God will not save you from the flame
God will not save you
God will not answer to your name
God will not save you

There's no beginning there will be no end
'Til every enemy becomes a friend
The will fall on the battlefield that we defend
To the cry of our nation
