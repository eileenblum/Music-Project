So my friend it comes to this, you stand below the precipice!
You are looking up at me, I'm leaning on the breeze.
You think you cannot break my fall! I blame myself for wanting more!

Though my love is blind, my eyes are open every time I hurt you!

[Chorus:]
It's not your fault you cannot love me; you are not to blame!
I never told you I was heartless, I'm heartless!
I though you'd be a stronger master, so I took your sword!
You're not the bringer of disaster â I'm heartless!

Well my friend, to tell the truth I love you every way I can,
I was broken long ago by an evil cunning man.
I think we've done our very best to fill the hollow in my chest!

Though your heart is strong, I won't remain to see it broken longer!

[Chorus]

And when I dream, I feel the beat ..... the flutter makes me hopeful!
What mighty fears of love's deceit ..... All distant lies and memories!
Memories......!

No more tears or pain! My friend you know you're better off without me!Â 

[Chorus]
