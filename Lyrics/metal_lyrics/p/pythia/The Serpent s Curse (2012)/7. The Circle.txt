Welcome my friends,
I'm the creator
Your host for the night
I'll put you at ease
These are the beasts,
The apes in their cages
And I will atone and do as you please

I will destroy your peace and favour
I will console with empty bliss

Welcome to sin,
To hell and damnation
With each growing limb,
The race with unfold
Bones that are straight 
And hands that are open
I offer you this 'til our story's told

I will explain away confusion
I will be more than any God

These are the words we never will write
These are the pictures we hide in our heads
These are the thoughts we strip from our minds
We are all bound to the circle of flesh

So now my friends,
We've come to the section 
Where it all depends on how much you'll pay
Some will pay hardship and 
Some will pay money
But it's all the same at the end of the day

I will accept your soul conviction
I will crucify again

These are the words we never will write
These are the pictures we hide in our heads
These are the thoughts we strip from our minds
We are all bound to the circle of flesh

(Come to my arms my faithless companions
I promise you this, 
You'll never regret
Reach for the sun that
Glitters so sweetly 
And go to our graves as one)
