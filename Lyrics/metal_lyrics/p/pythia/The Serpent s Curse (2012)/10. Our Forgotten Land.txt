This is the last time we will speak,Â 
we have no words left for tomorrow!
All of these years we've been alone,
waiting for your call to return us home.

Now we know that time left us far behind!

[Chorus:]
We buried our children, we planted the barren sand,
We were faithful! We fought for our kingdom,
we fought for you sword in hand
our forgotten land!Â 

Now that the winds have come to change all the broken oaths .....
They are silenced!
Never a king, never a prince will regain our trust,
Every hope is dust!

Now we know that kings bribe with broken rings!

[Chorus]

We come here in peace but you must not forget all of your people who live in regret!
All of the hardship and all of the pain while you lived in splendour, enjoying your reign!
Look to the night when Our People will come, when Your Majesty will find His life course has run!
We are the men you forgot to recall, and We will have revenge, andÂ we will see your fall! See your fall!

This is the last word we will say: this is open war, and it's time to pay!
Now you know, my Lord, you will face the sword!Â 

[Chorus â 2x]
