I've thought it over
I don't want you to be around
This four-leaf clover
Is poisonous, it brings me down

When I'm lying in my bed
I feel you next to me
When I think of what you said
Then I can hardly breathe

This is not war
This is just goodbye
This is not truth
This is just a lie
There's no way
That you're leaving
There's no way
That you're killing me
There's no way
That I'm bleeding
Your broken heart
Will set my free

I hate your silence
I hate the way you think you care
I hate tomorrow
Because I know you will be there

When I think of how you live
That woman on you arm
I have nothing else to give
But I can do you harm

This is not war
This is just goodbye
This is not truth
This is just a lie

Darkness encroaches
To my lone cravings
I am born wanton
I am born broken
