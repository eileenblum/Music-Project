Once there was a man who lived
A thousand centuries
Just to see what all this would become
Soon he saw the whole, all eventualities
Never took his eyes from the sun

As the years unfold and the sun grows
Colder and the moon 
Becomes a ghostly serenade
Never to grow old and never wonder
What the greatest journey 
Would become in days

Under the sea of blood 
Under the sea of blood

Oh my salvation, you are my dark star
I will become what other dread to be
And so the stars exploded
Into the blackest void
And all was left to dust and light

He came to see destruction
Upon a noble steed 
But all he saw was endless night

Once there was a girl who lived
A thousand centuries
Never found a friend to call her own
Soon she turned to ice,
a mountain of indignity
Couldn't bare the awful years alone
