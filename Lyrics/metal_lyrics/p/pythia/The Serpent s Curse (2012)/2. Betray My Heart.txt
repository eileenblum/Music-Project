One little kiss
For all your secrets
One for every spell you cast
Turn the page to find a potion
That wont cure an aching heart
Iâll cry a tear of sadness
Every single time we touch
But you will not set me free
Not before my blood to much

Though I begged for you to leave me
Cut the cord that ties us true
Still you weave your magic further
And I find Iâm bound to you
Never taste the brew that binds you
For your done with everything
Poisoned ivy, blood red rose
And every curse that goes with it

Look it is the road to heaven
And its smoothly paved
Misery the truth of sinners
Never to be saved

Betray my heart
With your dark fire
I cannot leave me in desire
Betray my heart
It brings me under
You cannot break this spell Iâm under
Betray my heart

I have played each ace and joker
I have played a fragile maid
I have tried to heal your demons
Left you lonely I have strayed
But each way I play me cards I cannot find the winning hand
Cannot leave your love behind me
Cannot leave this better land

Miserys the truth of sinners
Never to be saved

Betray my heart
With your dark fire
I cannot leave me in desire
Betray my heart
It brings me under
You will not break this spell Iâm under

One little kiss for all your secrets
One for every bruise I get
One for those who tie us down to every broken love affair
Take the gun and pull the trigger
Still the magic flows and burns
Still I hope to take each other
Still the hungry wolves returns

Miserys the truth of sinners
Never to be saved

Betray my heart
With your dark fire
I cannot leave me in desire
Betray my heart
It leaves me under
You cannot break tis spell Iâm under
