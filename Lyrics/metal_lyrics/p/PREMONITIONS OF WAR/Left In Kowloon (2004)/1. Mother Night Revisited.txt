Biting through tongues and foaming at the mouths. Splicing together what 
will not pan out. Wax works for bitter pills, yet vials and spoons seem 
better still. Trade all the lines that you cut in for all the hours spent 
blacked out and shivering into mother night again. Trade all your needles 
for all the sleep you've missed. As much as you can get. She'll tuck you 
into pitch.
