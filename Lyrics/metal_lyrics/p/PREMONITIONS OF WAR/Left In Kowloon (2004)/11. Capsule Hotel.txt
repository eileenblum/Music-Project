Harmony in slipping out of the existence of me. Rotting into bliss again and 
crawling inside to sleep them all off. White lights and rested heads 
dropping the "better left unsaid." Blending into their ambience like the 
background music it is. Bathing in the isolation. Miles wash off and hands 
left worthless.
