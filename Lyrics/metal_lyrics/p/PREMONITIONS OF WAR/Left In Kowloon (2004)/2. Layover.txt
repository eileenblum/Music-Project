Sweating out the hours meticulously collected, pinpointed and highlighted. 
Scratching off events and fifth lines for a better sense of purpose. 
Tallying up what's gone done for good. On the outskirts of familiarity, 
complacency has terminal light. And total silence, a welcome foreign 
language. Outrun them all. Outrun their marathon. Outrun them on everyone's 
time but my own.
