You say I'm scared, maybe you're right. But I'm not scared of you. Just whisper your tiniest little secrets to me. And I'll tell you nothing but lies. Staying silent, appearing knowing. Don't be fooled. The foolish game repeats itself without a pause. A perfect articulation. I'm not sorry you were fooled.
