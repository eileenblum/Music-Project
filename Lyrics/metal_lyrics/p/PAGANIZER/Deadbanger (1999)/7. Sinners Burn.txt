If disbelief is a deadly sin, then put me to death
If belief will save my life, it is nothing worth

I know a carnal truth, of flesh and bone
No lies from your mouth, can turn that to stone

And I know that sin is yours
And sinners burn...

Crucify my rotting corpse, or die for all sins
Neither way, no matter what you say Ill believe in your lies

And on the stakes they burn, those who believed
Who's laughing now? Not the lying creed!
