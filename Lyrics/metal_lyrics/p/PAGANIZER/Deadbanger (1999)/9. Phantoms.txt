Like a shadows in the night, fading away
A ghost without form, the father of all scorn

A dark formation, slowly taking shape
It can be the greatest fear, of your life

Like phantoms, slowly slipping away
Like evil phantoms, formless and grey

You cannot run, cause it is everywhere
It is everything, you ever feared
