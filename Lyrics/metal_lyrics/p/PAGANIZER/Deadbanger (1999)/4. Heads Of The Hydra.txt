A creator seldom seen, is riding the skies
Wings of steel-clad fury, flesh of wizard lies

Forged in Satan's fires, Born to burn the earth
Mankind's greatest fear, by evil given birth

Controlled by spell-craft, secret magic words
Retrieved from beyond, distant darkened worlds

Once decapitated, it is not devastated
For every severed head, three new are breed

Heads, heads - of the hydra
