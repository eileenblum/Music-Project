Bang you heads, yeah, to the music of Satan
Unleash the beast, that swells inside
Bang your heads, yeah

Blow out your head
Be a deadbanger
Come join the dead

Come on, explode, Into Satan's kingdom
Tear down the walls, around the beast
Obey the voice, In your blackened heart
Come on, explode

I see her face in the crowd
Banging her had so proud
Her fist held up high
She'll keep banging 'til the day she die...
