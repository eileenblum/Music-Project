We believe in the sign of true metal
Death to false players of rock 'n roll
We hail the glorious sign in the name of metal
With leather and chains, spikes and blades
We are here to rock you - to hell!

We are the maniacs - come on and bang your heads
We are the metal crusaders - come on and hail the kings

We believe in the templars of metal
Warriors of the ancient metal gods
Pagan crusader, children of the night
With our swords in the sky with might and pride
We are here to rock you - to hell

Come on, clap your hands
Bang your heads for Satan
