Hordes of the dark now arise, Brining Chaos - chaos!
The gateway is flowing over, with the creatures of the night

Bleeding lands for the reaper, Evil now has risen
You fight the demons, Armed with steel and shield, oh yeah

Dragons they fly in the sky, Blowing fire - fire
Now is the time to fight, Rise with steel in your hand

The mark of evil - burnt into your flesh

The venom of evil, inside your flesh
