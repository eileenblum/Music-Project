A storm is coming, destroyer of worlds
Winds of steel and chaos, brings us to our knees

A storm ascending, this time it's for real
Darkness descending, we put our trust in steel

We stand prepared to fight. We'll meet our fate tonight

The wind is tearing hard. Still we're standing tall
If chaos reaps us, as warriors we fall

Like a whisper of storms to come, evil will be done
