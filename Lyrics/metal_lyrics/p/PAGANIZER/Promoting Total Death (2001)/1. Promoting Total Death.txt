Set the missiles free
Unleash the manmade cleanser
Wipe the slate clean again
Using total death
Since the dawn of ages
Greed has thrived within
We've lost our right to this place
Let's nuke away all sin

[Chorus:]
Promoting the total death of mankind
Abomination

Another dawn will rise
Unstained by profit
A new dawn arise
From the ashes of demise
