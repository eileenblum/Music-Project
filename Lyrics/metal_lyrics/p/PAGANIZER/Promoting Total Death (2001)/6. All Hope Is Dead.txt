A feeble run for freedom at last
The hunt is on the rush now explodes

Torn from your life and now inserted
Into the role of the hunted prey

Nowhere to run no place is safe
You are lost we crave your soul
Your body is the target so keep on
Don't spoil the game until you die

[Chorus:]
Feel the bullets enter
Convulse as you die
Out pours the red
All hope is dead
