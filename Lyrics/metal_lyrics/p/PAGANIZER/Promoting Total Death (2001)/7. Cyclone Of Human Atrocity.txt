Cyclone of human atrocity
Roaming town by town
Leaving a trail of blood to follow
Severed legs, hacked up dead

Preying on the outcasts
Chainsaws and hammers at work in the alley
A message is left on the wall
Five down thousands to go

[Chorus:]
Join the cyclone
Wield the axe, swing the hammer
Join the cyclone
Pull the trigger now

LIFE SLIPS AWAY
Pull the trigger back, release the lead
Spraying the feeble masses unleashing death
One in the chest another in the back
Mass execution, it's my way to fame

[Chorus:]
Life is slipping away
It's out of your grasp
Another fucking victim
Life is fading fast

If I take a bullet, my work is done
News at six gunman, that's who I am
Pull the trigger back, release the lead
Spraying the feeble masses unleashing death
