Blood spurts out from the hole in your throat
Red phlegm ejected, coughing up your bowels
Destination death, noone can help you now
Screaming don't come easy with punctured lungs

[Chorus:]
Brutal way to die
Force the axe through the thorax
Brutal way to die
Hacked up, fucked up

Limbs have bee severed and put away
The axe now comes down upon your torso
The joy of maiming, such a cheap thrill
When your body's gone another one will follow
