The roar of guns echoing all over this bloodstained valley
...screams rising in the heat
Warriors on mighty black horses comes riding through the battlefield
Spitfire opened, no time to think, the troopers friend is now his shield

It is war
The war is here and you are in it
It is war
You may lose or you may win

The eyes are glowing on the enemy, ready kill burn and destroy
Go forward all their deeds done with joy
Warriors on mighty black horses comes riding through the battlefield
Spitfire opened, no time to think, the troopers friend is now his shield
