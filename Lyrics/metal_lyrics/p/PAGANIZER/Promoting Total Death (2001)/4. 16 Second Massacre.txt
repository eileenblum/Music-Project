Kick the door in and open fire
They all shall die
Emptying gun by gun
Survivors? I know there's fucking none
I am reality and I come calling
Packing massive heat
Armed and fucking rabid

[Chorus:]
16 second massacre
It's all it took
Piles of victims stacking up
Dead

Lock'n'load, bodies explode, blood is everywhere
Hammer back, slow release, sparing fucking no one
