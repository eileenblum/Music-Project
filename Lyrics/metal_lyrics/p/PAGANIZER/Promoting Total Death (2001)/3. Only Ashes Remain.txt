Life is no more
You will rot away
Feed the funeral pyres
It's your final stage
No way of redemption
There's no turning back
Death has come at last
Now you start to moulder

[Chorus:]
Only ashes
Remain
Only ashes remains of you

Destined to feed the worms
Feel them as they squirm
Destined to be rot
Rot
