embracing slowly
the soil around me
taking it all inside this earthly warmth

clockwise moving
towards my earthly red

how sweet the stench
of my remains
how dead and beatiful I must be

clockwise moving towards the end
so enough in decay I will rest forever
how sweet the stench of my remains
how dead and beatiful I must be to you all
