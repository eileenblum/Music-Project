wasted flesh
given a broken shell
wayward soul
trapped in carnal  hell
still fearing the exit

I'm just here
rotting away
like everyone else in this hell

wayward pain
eating its way inside
festering slowly until I die

Just here rotting
I'm just here dying
struggling in fear
longing for an end
