[Bonus Track]concieved in a casket
grown in a rotten womb
fetal rot breeding still
obscenity of moulding flesh

deliverd into unlife
sucking a fermenting teeth
swallowing only worms

emerging from the soil
horrid sickness
crawling up through the dirt
undeath rising slow

you were born from filth
soon to be thrown back
another end is now
born only to be buried alive
