Rusting steel enters
slowly with no ease
old tools in use again
bringing extreme pain

blunt blade surgery
aiming for maximum injury

forced into the thorax
ripping it all apart
through cartilage and bone
digging for the heart

limbs are hacked away
no wa you're getting out alive
