Alone with pain
sucking it again and again
no sweetness found
only fucking fear

solitude is hell
the loneliness of flesh
packed in meta to suffer
after life no more

sacred lives and holy lies

this life is a disease
it's absurdity
we are the unknowing dead

we are the unknowing dead
only here to rot
we are the spew of rancid fucking sickness
