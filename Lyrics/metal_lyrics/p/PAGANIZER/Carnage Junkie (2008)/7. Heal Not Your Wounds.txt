Pull the trigger
be sure the angle is right
to miss is to fail
to fail us to survive

anticipation of dying
such a strong feeling
life is all about lying
truth is found in death

heal not your wounds
let yourself bleed dry

blow the pain away
one single shot
extreme conditions
demand extreme responses
