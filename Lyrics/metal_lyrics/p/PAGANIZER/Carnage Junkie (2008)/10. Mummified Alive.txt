Engorged in sulphur
not rotting as you're preserved
bled out but breathing
kept alive to suffer

the punishment 
is to be mummified alive

emptied from fluids
mummified you suffer still
a breathing corpse
that will keep on going forever

in a glass casket
you will never rot
suffering forever
insane, now and ever
