A sudden burst of pain
As human limbs are torn away
Broken upon the cross suffering
Your bitter loss of life
Nailed to the shape you hold so high
Mourning life that fades away
As you're crucified
The worms come slowly crawling
Gathering for your supper
The thirteenth one the since
Long forgotten son
Of slumbering urges
Now your fading life suddenly has a price
The bleeding never stops
In the halls of rectification
Into the flood of pain
Neverending suffering
The worms come slowly crawling
Gathering for your supper
Nailed to the shape you hold so high
Mourning life that fades away
As you're crucified
