Salvation comes quickly
Through the barrel of a gun
Death overwhelms the victims
Creating a killing spree they bleed unto me
Morbid initiation
To a higher cause
Born to die and to be resurrected through carnage
Butchery uncontrolled
The heavens are bleding
With rejected life
I wade through the bloodbath aftermath
Slaughtered and free they bleed unto me
Breeding wardogs from human slugde
Reviving the dead to make them kill again
Bloodstreams washes your blistered face
Undead creatures fallen from grace
Fascination you're excreting satisfies my greed
Salvation comes quickly
Through the barrel of a gun
Death overwhelms the victims
Creating a killing spree they bleed unto me
Bleed unto me
Redemption through bloodshed
Bleed unto me
