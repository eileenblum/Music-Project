Forevermore submerged
In the filth of your deceit
As you preach that sinners
Burn your soul rots away
Meateater
Time for you has come to bleed
Consumed from within
By the abuse that you breed
You thrive on the innocent
Provided by your sheep
Life moves clockwise
But in hell there's no time
Only penetance, no deliverance
Drained of life you lie
Awaiting no redemption
There is no turning back as all
Turns black, as your soul
There's no leniance
Only severance
Of your limbs for eternity as you suffer
Drained of life you lie
Awaiting no redemption
There is no turning back as all
Turns black as your soul
Black robe, white collar
Preying on the young
Man of cloth until your time has come
Then you'll be but meat to burn
Meateater
Die
