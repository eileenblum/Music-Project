A grain of salt
Rubbed into your wounds
A thousand burning nails driven through your skin
Dreams of tremendous pain
Awakened into dimensions deranged
A rust covered blade
Rips your flesh
The suffering is endless as you enter death
Knowing now
That pain is your fate
Bleed in hell eternally redemption came too late
Formaldehyde dreams tearing your soul
Your flessh will feed the fires of hell
Blasphemy in a million ways
Enter now suffering grace
Fromaldehyde dreams tearing your soul
Your flesh will feed the fires of hell
Dreams of tremendous pain
Awakened into dimensions deranged
