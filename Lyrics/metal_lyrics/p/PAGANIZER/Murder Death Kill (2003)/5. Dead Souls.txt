Crucified shreds of humans
Rotting through the fields
Views of defeated flesh scorched into their minds
Dead world delivered into chaos
Dead souls transfixed in pain
The final call for redemption transfixed
In pain only suffering remains
The corruption of flesh arises
Its stench now unfolds
Dreams of the final war seeps into every human soul
Burn in torment
Severed lies your lifeless meat
Scream in pain facing your bleeding defeat
Revelations of the end
Now come to undead life
Suffer eternal pain, the end of life upon us
Dead world delivered into chaos
Dead souls transfixed in pain
The final call for redemption transfixed
In pain only suffering remains
Crucified shreds of humans
Rotting throughout the fields
Views of defeated flesh scorched into their minds
