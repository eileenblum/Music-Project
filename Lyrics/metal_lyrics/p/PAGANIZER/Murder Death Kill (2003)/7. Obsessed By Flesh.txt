A wasted life at end but death goes on
Deflowered serenity as I'm reeking of decay
Sewage from my corpse dripping down
Infesting the soul with my ort
Obsessed by flesh
I'm living decomposed
The sweet stench of rotting liquid limbs
The wax on my skin invites the maggots in
My little helper on the path to nothingness
Render me fleshless devour me dead
Flesh obsessed, still womehow I breathe
I need to become one with the dead
Descending into the sinsiter abyss of pain
Flesh obsessed, still somehow I breathe
Decomposed rotting slowly
Morbid awakening into suffering
Obsessed by flesh
I'm living decomposed
