The suffering spirals downwards
It lingers into your soul
Obscured lies your thoughts dissected and dead like you
Crawl to the cross
Submerged in pain as you die
Those wretched slabs of flesh
There's no misplaced affection
Human vivisections is there a gap
Inside that holds a soul
Crawl to the cross
Submerged in pain as you die
Crawl to the cross as you die once again
Dying is nothing but human and then you fade away
But where you're going pain lasts forever
Grapsing for your holy crucifix
Do you think it'll savy you from death?
Dying is nothing but human and then you fade away
But where you're going pain lasts forever
The suffering spirals downwards
It lingers into your soul
Obscured lies your thoughts dissected
And dead like you
Crawl to the cross
Submerged in pain as you die
Crawl to the cross as you die once again
