This is the year of 666
You will die on the crucifix
Dead and torn you rot away
Suffering for eternal days
In the burial garden
Where corpses cover the gournd
The soil is fed by your blood forevermore
Wastelands of human flesh
This is the place where you belong
Burning eternal fire
The pain will forever go on
Morbid ways to end your life
Still you suffer endless ly
Drowning in seas of sin as you born forever
The burial garden where no life dwells
Corroded meat fading into eternity
Squirm in torment as I rid you from flesh
Decaying in pain but a bleeding mess
In the burial garden
Where corpses cover the ground
The soil is fed by your blood forevermore
