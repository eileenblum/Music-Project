Fading into darkness
The final cold has come
A life of pain and torture slowly submerged in death

Brutally torn sanity
Descend into and suffering once again

Shunned from life it seems
To suffer the past
Unblessed in screaming pain now and forever
Morbid visions burn
Inside my rotting soul
A life that once was but now has come to mould

Brutally torn sanity
Descend into suffering once again

Maggots in my flesh
Crawling slowly feeding
Screaming from my tomb of moulding meat

Death crawls inside my lungs
Fiercely grasping for my soul

Dead cold and slaughtered remains my soulless being
Floating through suffering

Fading into darkness
The final cold has come
A life of pain and torture slowly submerged in death

Brutally torn sanity
Descend into and suffering once again
