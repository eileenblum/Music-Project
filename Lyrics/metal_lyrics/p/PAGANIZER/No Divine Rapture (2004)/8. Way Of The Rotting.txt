Skin peeled from home
As yu're cleansed in hell
Through morbid pain
You pay for your sickened ways
You pay in blood

This is your punishment
Forever alive to die again

Flowing from your veins
The sick inside
Choke on putrefaction
Slowly as you die
As you're killed again and again

Rotting is your soul
Devoured
Morbid is the way you will travel

Damnation through torture
As you slowly burn
Suffering brings the end to your sickened ways

This is your punishment
Forever alive to die again

SKin peeled from bone
As you're cleansed in hell
Through morbid pain
You pay for your sickened ways
You pay in blood
