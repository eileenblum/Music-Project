Stalked through time
B y the urge to conquer
Like worms beneath the flesh
The need keeps on crawling

The plague that hurts
Festering the souls of the living

The plague inside us all
Feeding on human sickness

Sweeping across aeons
Mankinds breeding sickness
Struggling to remain in control
Tightening its killing grip

The plague that hurts
Festering the souls of the living

Dead we awaken
Devoured by the maggots

Slowly we're rotting
Submerged in filth
Doomed to suffer the plague that hunts us all

Dead we awaken
Devoured by the maggots

The plague inside us all
Feeding on human sickness

The plague that hurts
Festering the souls of the living
