On your knees
Confess your sins to me
And you will be forgiven

Open wide
And swallow my affection
You will receive redemption

There's no blasphemy
Within our stained agreement
Receive my blessing any way I give it

Molestation
Springs from your disease
Redeemed in pain
Dying on your knees

now die for me
Open your wrists
Conceal my sickness by ending your life

Receive eternal suffering
On your fucking knees

Molestation
Springs from your disease
Redeemed in pain
Dying on your knees

There's no blasphemy
Within our stained agreement
Receive my blessing any way I give it
