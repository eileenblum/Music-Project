Rotten to the core
Selfabsorbed deceiver
Defiling the young privided by his sheeplike creed

His putrid rot infects
All his fingers touch
Endulging in molestation after his sickened mass
Preying on the innocent
Their meat satisfies his need
There's no other solution that to burn the rot away

Preacher mouth
Like the stench of an open sore
Breeding sin the abscess in black

Kill him slow....

The sick in his soul, exanding within, yearns to be free
Molesting the young ripping their lives, feed on their cries

His putrid rot infests
All his fingers touch
Endulging in molestation after concluding his sickened mass

Preacher mouth
Like the stench of an open sore
Breeding sin the abscess in black
