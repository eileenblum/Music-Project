Reaching for your cross
As your life is drained
Your saviour high above
Laughs in his filthy heaven

Devour digest your rancid flesh
Defecate your lies

Excruciating pain
Rips through your dying body
The pain will forever remain
As you burn in hell

Devour digest your rancid flesh
Defecate your lies

The last you'll feel is me
Ending your life
The last you'll taste is blood pouring from your mouth

Bleeding from your wounds
Redemption is not to be found

The last you'll feel is me
Ending your life
The last you'll taste is the blood pouring from your mouth
As you die

Reaching for your cross
As your life is drained
Your saviour high above
Laughs in his filthy heaven

Devour digest your rancid flesh
Defecate your lies
