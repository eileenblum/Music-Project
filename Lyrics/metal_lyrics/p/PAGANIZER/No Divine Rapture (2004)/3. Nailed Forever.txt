Embrace your herd and smile in deceit
Cumming in your role during mass among the young
The need to defile the youngest of flesh
A sickening urge for which you'll burn in hell

Soon to be dead with maggots crawling in your head

Nailed forever is what you'll be
Nailed forever in hell

Stainless steel to hold you in place
There's no redemption
Rotting in hell for your sickened deeds
Over and over again

Nailed forever
Like the scum you are

Embrace your herd and smile in deceit
Cumming in your role during mass among the young
The need to defile the youngest of flesh
A sickening urge for which you'll burn in hell

Soon to be dead with maggots crawling in your head

Nailed forever is what you'll be
Nailed forever in hell
