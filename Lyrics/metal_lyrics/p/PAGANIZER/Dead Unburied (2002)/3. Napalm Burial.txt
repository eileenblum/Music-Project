Sowing the seeds of the dead
Feeding the ground
Shallow graves now boiling, into a burning storm
The stench rises
This napalm burial
Creates a realm of the fleshless
Cyclonic slaughter
Napalm defleshing the bodies
Massive the total impact, of blasting fire
Control obtained
Through total suffering
Now the disposal, of evidence is complete
Fire tears the corpses, flowing free
The ultimate scavenger, ashes all it leaves
The stench rises
This napalm burial
Creates a realm of the fleshless
