I know they're coming for me
The voices finally flesh
I feel the ascending breeze of sulphurous hate
The final hour is now here
Nothing left to pray for
Now all the pain and fear will be unleashed
As atrocities unfold
Drawing blood from stone
Suffering is at hand
I am beyond redemption
Suffering thorough torture, all that's here will fry
Over and over a thousand times
Unallowed to die
As atrocities unfold
Drawing blood from stone
Suffering is at hand
I am beyond redemption
