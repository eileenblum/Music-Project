Blood sprays the walls
Bowels all over the floor
You know you are dead when my knife tears your chest
Hatred burns
Even in hell
The fear of dying
Once again
Ripped to bleeding pieces
By the madman inside
Raped and brutally butchered but not in that order
Now stripped of your skin
I continue to rape your flesh
Still in death you will be able to fulfill my sickest needs
Hatred burns
Even in hell
The fear of dying
Once again
Torture, endless despair
Evoked by blades through flesh
Blood sprays the walls
Bowels all over the floor
You know you are dead when my knife tears your chest
