Feeding my festering
They will submit their flesh
I shed their blood perpetually forever
Gasping for life as they choke on me
I devour the remains ejaculating hell
Brimfilled corpses covers the ground
A field of total massacre
The art of murder
Torture
The tools of slaughter
Flesh supremacy
Feeding on slaughtered souls, their total fear
Ripping their lives to pieces,
Destroying the dreams they have been given
Feeding my festering
They will submit their flesh
I shed their blood perpetually forever
The art of murder
Torture
The tools of slaughter
Flesh supremacy
