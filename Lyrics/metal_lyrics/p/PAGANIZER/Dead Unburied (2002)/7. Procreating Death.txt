Twisted shreds of flesh
Twitching as nerves decay
The blade penetrates your every inch of skin
Dying moans fading, darkness has come for you
No recollections left, only imminent death
Carving my way inside
To your inner realms
Tearing your remnants to bleeding shards
Devouring your flesh
Feeding on your every scream
Now you know that you will die
Procreate suffering
Humanity washed away
Dead unburied you lay rotting
Dead unburied merging with the soil
Twisted shreds of flesh
Twitching as nerves decay
The blade penetrates your every inch of skin
Dying moans fading, darkness has come for you
No recollections left, only imminent death
Procreate suffering
Humanity washed away
