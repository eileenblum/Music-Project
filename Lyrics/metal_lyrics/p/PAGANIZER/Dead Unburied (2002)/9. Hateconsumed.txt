Bodies burned beyond all human belief
Annihilation slowly sweeps the land
All traces of mankind forever thrown into oblivion
All feeble attempts to reign has failed
A mankind born to suffer
A breed left to die
Hateconsumed and bleeding
Relentless rapture rising to scavenge humanity
A world destroyer now unleashed
Slaughtered flesh aflame upon the pyres we die
As sinners we burn dying in vain forever
A mankind born to suffer
A breed left to die
Hateconsumed and bleeding
Rapturous slaughter
The final day has now come
A mankind born to suffer
A breed left to die
Hateconsumed and bleeding
