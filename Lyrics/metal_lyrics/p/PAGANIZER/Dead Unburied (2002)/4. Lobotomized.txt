Deep embedded within
The urge to disembowel
To feed on the dead and wear their skin
Now, your flesh is mine to dissect
Soon, you lay gutted begging for death
Death comes crawling
As I rip your skin
Ferocious ways to tear your squirming body
Razorsharp dreams of dread
Bloodsoaked walls
As my hunger is fed by your bleeding remains
You will die
Stripped of human form
You will burn
Lobotomized
Now, your flesh is mine to dissect
Soon, you lay gutted begging for death
You will die
Stripped of human form
You will burn
Lobotomized
