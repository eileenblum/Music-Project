THE SKIES TURN TO SULPHUR
THE VORTEX HAS OPENED AGAIN
RIDDING THIS PLACE OF LIFE
THEY NOW ASCEND

AS THEY ARRIVE
TO ENTHRONE THIS WORLD
ENTERS THE HORRORS OF THE ANCIENTÂ´S RETURN

A CHAOTIC UPHEAVAL
BEGINS THEIR REIGN
IMMENSE HATRED
SWEEPS THE WORLD

WINGS OF ABOMINATION DESCEND
THROUGH STORMS THEIR ARRIVAL COME
CREATURES OF AEONS PAST REIGN AGAIN
THE RETURN OF HORROR
THE NEW DAWN IS HERE
FOREVER TO BE THE RETURN OF HORROR
