THROUGH AEONS OF FUNERALS
ALL THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE
STILL THRIVE OBESED FESTERING AND FEEDING

SPEWING THEIR ULCEROUS FOG
CATACOMBS EVOLVES INTO BOGS
DAMPENED CAVERNS HARBORING WHAT SHOULD NEVER BEEN BORN
THROUGH THE HUMAN CESSPOOL
SLUMBERING SICKNESS BREEDS
EXPANDING FROM THE ROT INTO A PROCREANT BEAST

IT HAS BEGUN AGAIN
THE PROCREATION FEAST

A NEWBORN PUTRIDITY
THE MORBIDLY OBSCENE

THE PROCREATION
OF THE MORBIDLY OBSCENE
HAS COME TO EXIST
IN A DAWN OF SPEW
