I HANG BOLTED
UPON THE WALL OF PAIN
NAILED LIKE A TROPHY HEAD
GUTTED AND OBSCENELY SPREAD

FLESH COLLECTOR
HEÂ´S THE GUTTER OF THE DEAD

A CREATURE CORRUPTED
GUT THE BEST OF ME
NOW LICKING THE WOUNDS
FROM WHICH I BLEED

RIPPING MYSELF LOOSE
FROM THE NAILS THAT HOLD ME
STEEL AND RUST LEAVING MY BATTERED FLESH
CRAWLING TOWARDS THE EXIT
ONLY TO REALIZE
IÂ´M SUBMERGED IN A CELLAR
DEVOID OF ALL ESCAPE

AND HERE I LAY GUTTED
AWAITING THE END
TO BE A PART OF A COLLECTION
I WANTED TO BE MY OWN
