THEY ALL HAVE FROZEN HEARTS
THEIR SOULS ARE COLD
LIKE SHEEP THEY SCATTER
WHEN TRUTH AS TIMES ERUPT

LIKE STABBING FROZEN GROUND
THEIR FLESH IS SO COLD

SOON TO BE THAWING
THROUGH A CARBONIZED RESURRECTION

NO MORE BLADES AND SPIKES
NOW I BATHE THEM
NO MORE KNIVES AND CHAINS
I JUST SUBMERGE THEM IN FLAME

THEN FIRE AWAKENS THEM
IN CLEANSING DEFLESHMENT
THEY BURN SO WELL A CARBONIZED RESURRECTION
