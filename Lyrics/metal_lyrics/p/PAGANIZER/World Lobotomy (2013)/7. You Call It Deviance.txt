The cold inside it grows
It covers me completely
Their needs to control
Eats away at my soul

To shun a world of lies
Keeps me alive
Their lies burn inside me
But my spite kills their fire
You call it deviance
I call it salvation

They spew their lies
And we suck their cum
In the end we all
Shall slowly rot to dirt

Feeding a common master
The all consuming maggot
