A slow crawl
Into the hole
This beast craves your flesh not your soul

A slithering twist
And it is inside
This beast will feed even though you have not yet died

Hordes of the crawling
Come to feast
Your body is now an amusement park

These visitors
Will stay to play
And wonet even leave after dark

As the maggots gather
You know your end is near
As the maggots crawl inside
To die is no longer your biggest fear
