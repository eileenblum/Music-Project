Coming from beneath
Crawling through the soil
Heaps of human rot
They'll kill you on the spot

Ganging up to feed
Flooding the streets
Mass of hungry corpses
In need of alive resources

Hunt eat repeat
Hunt eat repeat
This world they will delete

Feeding away
As they arrive
You're tickling the taste
Of the undead

Hunt them down
Or they will hunt you
