The fires arise
Around the world
A breed of sickness, set out to destroy

Killing and raping
Murdrring the earth
Preying on all life, like a plague

This needs to end
Mankind burn away
Cleanse the disease, known as man

Butchery, debauchery
World lobotomy

Burn in a hell, by your own creation
Suffer your deeds, you are the sickness that breeds
