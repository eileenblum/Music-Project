Fading souls
Awaken into dying
In search of life they are roaming unblessed

Death grips your soul
As blood grows cold
Is this hell or is there more pain to find ?

As blood grows cold
We know that life is ending

No more life
The end draws near
Now your atheist ways soon exchanged in prayers

Alone with this pain buried fears unearth
Alone with this pain that forever remains
