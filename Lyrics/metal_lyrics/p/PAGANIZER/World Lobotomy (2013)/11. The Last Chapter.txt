Slowly all your life has drained away
All you are is sickness
Crawling into emptiness
Doomed to and end
You can not reconcile with

This is the last
Chapter of your life

Dormant fears brings you pain
Until you go insane
Squirming like a maggot
Swept away by devouring darkness
Submerged in utter pain
You squirm forever

The last chapter unfolds
Death is all that remains

Dommed to an end
You can not reconcile with
Mourning a life that's fled
And all left undone
