Armageddon has come
To end the reign of man
Centuries of filth, the end at hand

Years of rape
Of this dying earth
It's time to pay, and there's no escape

Down comes the fire from the sky
Time has come to die
The flames burn higher and higher
The sky on fire

The sky on fire, burning redemption
The sky on fire, in afterlife you burn

Endtime, now has come
Eradication, mankind washed away
Endtime, apocalyptic wastes
Now the only thing tha will emerge
