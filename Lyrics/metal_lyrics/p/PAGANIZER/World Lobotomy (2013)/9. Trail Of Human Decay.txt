You will know your fate
It will come to be
It will take your breath away
Soon as you die

There's no way of escaping
Your dying destiny
There is no way out
From this place of suffering

Trail of human decay
Suck the marrow dry

These bones will never live again

There's no way of escaping
Your dying destiny
The only way to escape
Is in a body bag

The trai lyou leave
Such remains of filth and pain
All our breeding brings is the growth of insects
