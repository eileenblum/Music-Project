As you breathe water
And your lungs explode
Your flesh is ripped to shreds to feed the mollusk

They get you from below
The drowners
Waiting to drag you down
The drowners

Submerged in a watery grave
Swollen corpses everywhere
Deepwater meatlocker
None survived they all died

The drowners
Pulling you down to make you die
The drowners
Feeding on your bloate flesh

They get you from below
The drowners
Waiting to drag you down
The drowners
Hunting day and night for victims to submerge
The drowners

They pull you under
Human life gone asunder
