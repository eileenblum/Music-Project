Riding the winds foretold
towards certain and utter doom
this was meant to be
the last ride of the soon to be free

When everything ends
nothing is all that will be
when the universe is to sieze
remnants will not be

Loke at the helm
birthright executed
in this final night
the dead will arise

From the remains of the dead
this ship of the doomed came to be
now on its predestined journey
shed the final tear before the end

At the helm of Naglfar
towards the end
at the helm stands Loke
awaiting whats needs to be done
