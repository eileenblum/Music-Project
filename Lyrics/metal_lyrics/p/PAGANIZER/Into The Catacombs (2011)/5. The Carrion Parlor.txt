I invite them in
to experience sin
I invite them dead
in my carrion parlor

Shielded by the law
redneck rampant breed
creating a land of their own
where the saw is the law

This cellar is a killing floor
hooks and chains installed
to procreate the work from before
through human slaughter and then feeding

A work for the family
to preserve and feed them
a trade coming to life
during the slaughter
