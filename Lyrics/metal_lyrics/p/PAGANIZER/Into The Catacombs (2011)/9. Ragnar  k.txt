Pillars of smoke
rising from burning cities
endtimes has come
mushroom clouds cover the earth

The planet aflame
radiation scorches the soil
silos puking missiles
no hope left, just eternal war

The end has come for man
a last age of total war
no hope for a final stand
this is ragnarÃ¶k
