Winter has come
the winter of our end
the snow stained red
by eviscerated humans

A massive upheaval
of the raped dying earth
every catastrophe
has come to be

The winter of
disembowelment
the earth anew, and now content

The winter of
human death
humanitys last gasping breath

The ground now opens to swallow
cities and entire continents
the world covered in corpses
humanity cast down in hell
