A rotten existence
soon to end in pain
a wait for nothing more
than carnal suffering

This deterioration
we are born into
the hell of human flesh
to breathe and suffer

And this cadaver earth
will feed on our decay
and this cadaver earth
will be reborn - humanless

A universe
filled of death
life just born
to fade and die

A universe
filled of death
seasons come and go
and so do I and so do you

And this rotting place
will feed from your flesh
and this rotting place, will birth a new day
