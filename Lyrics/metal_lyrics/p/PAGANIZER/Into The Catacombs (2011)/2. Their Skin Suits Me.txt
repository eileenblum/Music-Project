Nocturnal hunter, a sickened man
out for the reaping of flesh
an urge inside, a sickened need
drives this human shell

I strip them from skin
in my carnal kingdom
I clad myself in them
Their skin suits me, so well

To transform, into a butterfly
to leave this world so wrong
I do these, awful things
to ensure the transformation

Burning inside
from a twisted need
unhuman things I do

Burning inside
from all twisted deeds
from these horrors alive
