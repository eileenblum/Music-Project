Upon the shoulders of man, the head of the beast
Worshipped by the evil hordes, dark evil lord

Carnivorous ferocity, a breed that should not be
A master of devilry, in sand enthroned

Into the catacombs, the fires burn
Into the catacombs, the shadows yearn

So feared by all of light, plotting in the dark
To bring on full demise, so the dark will rise

And let creations crown
Feel vengeance coming down
Feel vengeance coming - down!
