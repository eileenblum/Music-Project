A dawn of nothing
gave birth to a day of death
the apocalypse came
and left this world to die

Then came the vermin
the rats on two legs
they are the rulers of the wastelands
your brutal end

Ur smutsen reser dom sig
kackerlackor pÃ¥ tvÃ¥ ben
Ã¶verlevare i en dÃ¶d vÃ¤rld
vÃ¤gens okrÃ¶nta kungar

Nothing breathes
everything is dead
it is all scavenged
by the roadrats
