The hordes below
the breeders of the dead
tunnels underground
harbor the rotting

One shot to the head
to rid the filth
to stop the disease
from breeding again

To keep the sickness contained
to put the world at ease again

A bullet in the head
for the dead and sickened
a bullet in the head
for the undead

Hunting, underground
slaughtering the undead
hunting, underground
deminishing their numbers
