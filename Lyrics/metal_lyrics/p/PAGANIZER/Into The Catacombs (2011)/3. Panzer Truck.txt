Trapped in the city
trying to survive
surrounded only by the dead

The living corpses
gathers in herds
they are flooding every street

Mechanized fortress
panzer truck

The fight for survival
begins
and takes its toll fast

A need for relief
some space to breathe
is sorely fucken needed

Hunting the dead
to kill them again, re-killing the dead
ridding the plague
brain by brain, re-killing the dead
