A massive exodus
of unholy souls
the underworld is slowly opening

A morbid vortex
is slowly gathering
to unleash the unhuman overlords

Travelling through gateways
summoned by disciples
their time of reign
has come again

Yog Sothot arrives
as do the king in yellow
to claim the earth as their own

Yuggoth shivers
and releases its spawn
to swarm down upon humanity

Tsathoggua crawls
and Dagon arises from the depths
Cthulhu calls
total lovercraftian armageddon
