The pest, it came from the dead
Ridding the lands of life
The pest, it was the savior
Cleansing away the rot

Fields covered with death
Incubators of disease
Spawning the sickness supreme
Carried by the breeze

Punishment through defeat
Humanity forced to forever bleed

The hand of the dying god
Came to make us aware
The hand of utter doom
Took away all our lives

Viral defeat by air
Against which none can defend
Reaping lives by the wind
A breath of death and the end
