Dreams turn to beliefs
The awakening from slumber
The knowledge arisen
That life through death is real

Delusions cast aside
No more veiled by fear
Standing strong in your conviction
To create your kingdom here

Hordes take this land
We yield for no one
Our swords make our way
Our kingdom lies here

Our flesh can not be conquered
We are the many
Our way is the blade
So kneel or die

Reign of the artifact
That which many know
But none knows the secret of
We are the knight templars
