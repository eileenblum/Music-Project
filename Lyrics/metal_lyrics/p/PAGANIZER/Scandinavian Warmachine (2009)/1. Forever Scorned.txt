Waiting for the pestilence
To cleanse this place
Fields of sickening filth
The foul house that man built

Rating blood into sewers
Wartorn flesh swept aside
Manking is the bringer war
Spreading disease like a festering whore

Ash and death is all that be
The carcass of humanity

As mouthless creatures scream
The lands are soaked in blood
Giving place to funeral pyres
Set ablaze by the fiery flood

Rating blood into sewers
Wartorn flesh swept aside
Manking is the bringer war
Spreading disease like a festering whore

Ash and death is all that be
The carcass of humanity

No reign supreme
Shall ever be again
Lifeless scorched and torn
Now lies the cadaver of man

Forever scorn
Manking lays ripped and torn
Forever scorned
