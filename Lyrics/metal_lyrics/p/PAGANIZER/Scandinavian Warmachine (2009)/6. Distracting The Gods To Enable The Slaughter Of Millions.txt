They came to wreaktheir vengeance
Upon the ones they hate
To end the breeding of an entire race
To spew a reign of death

Distracting the gods
To enable the slaughter of millions

Dark agendas in use
The plan to fill and destroy
Cloated schemes of utter death
The stench of genocide on their breath

Perpetual massacre commenced
Hordes of victims fenced
Waiting like cattle to die
To feed the reign of the sick

Distracting the gods
To enable the slaughter of millions
Behind the curtain lies only death and doom

Distracting the gods
To enable atrocities to take place
In the dead of night
The screams of million souls
