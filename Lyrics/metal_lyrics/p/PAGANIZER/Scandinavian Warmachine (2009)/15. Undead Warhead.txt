The signs in the sky
Foreboding the end of man
A missile raging with fury

Twofaced savior arise
Herding the masses with lies
Gathering hordes of flesh

Cleansed of life
Like the stab of a knife
Putrid flesh machine
Once human, now dead and obscene

Floods from the skies
Washed away all life
The rain contained nuclear waste

Floods from the skies
Washed away all life
Aftermath of the undead warhead

Bathe in the fountain of death
Undead cleansed with putrid breath
Wash away your human shell
Trapped forever in an earthly hell
