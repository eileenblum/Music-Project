Marching through the permafrost
Ridden by the cold and the numbing of limbs
Onwards to the ultimate north
Frosting legions of hate now plow forth

Thule in flames

Battalions
Entrenched in the frozen soil
Onwards to Valhalla
As the battlefield boils

The armies of the damned dig in
Trenches boiling with the seed of death
The beast of steel and carnal hate
Now has come to annihilate

Thule set ablaze
The ultimate north now ablaze

Battalions
Entrenched in the frozen soil
Onwards to Valhalla
As the battlefield boils

Thule set ablaze
The ultimate north now ablaze
