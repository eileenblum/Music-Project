Bleeding through the mouth and nose
Still barging forth to kill
The jungle rot eats your flesh
But it hasn't killed your will

Pumping hate through your veins
Adrenaline jinties with guns
Powered by the hate of war
Death is all left to live for

Morbid panzer battalion
Steel and rotting flesh and bone
Morbid panzer battalion
Hard enough to squeeze blood from stone

Unconquered
Still reigning hell
Undead unmasked
Zombie warriors of death
