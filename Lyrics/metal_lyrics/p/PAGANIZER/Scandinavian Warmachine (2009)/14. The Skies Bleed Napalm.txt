The hell from above comes thundering
Releasing their cargo of death
Hidden in clouds now on the prowl
The steel havoc ejaculates

Running down the sides of the clouds
Like massive flood of blood
The everflowing stream of death
Burning sickened evil breath

The skies bleed napalm
Death poured from a sickened sky
The skies bleed napalm
Everyone shall burn and die

Raining down like molten lead
To make them all burning and dead

After a night of waiting
Now death comes crawling
Like rain from above
Floods of lava burns all life
