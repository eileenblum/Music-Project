Machines of the end
Lining up to spew forth death
Meat and bone now march
Into a dawnless night

Born only to die
Procreation of the sick
A spawn of sickened breed
To carry forth their putrid seed

Onward to die
Sacrificed your life

Upon fields of carnal remains
The war continues
Drenched in blood and sewage
The warriors crawl forth

Onwards to die and burn
The warmachine churns
Spitting forth the death
And the the disease they bring
