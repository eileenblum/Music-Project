DonÂ´t wanto to change when the devil
needs a brain
When you hear the funky sound
One of fife of fifty-three is six
DonÂ´t change for me
IÂ´ll take just one more

I shall summarize like a wave
into the distance
Are you feeling now
these days recorded

Runaway
Runaway

Done it again, scene it in red
Eyes on the brick layed Jesus breath
Forming inside, hearing your lies
Now I will share your bite

I shall summarize lika a wave
into the distance
Are you feeling now
these days recorded

Runaway
Runaway
