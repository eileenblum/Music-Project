Lies, lies are from the age
Keeping up with the powers of desire
Shapes, shapes of things to come
Everything in your mind has
just become rain

Colors are to burn,
colors are us over now
Sorry is a word, is this death to love
Holding on to our generation

All, all is nothing said
Nothing heard or felt that stays in mind
Breathe, breathe in all in fire
Flames scortching this visions
of the wave
Kiss, kiss into my heart
This way I can always undestand
Forever to die, forever to die and
just become rain

Colores are to burn, 
colores are us over now
Sorry is the word, is this death to love
Holding on to our generation

Breathe, breathe in all of fire
Flames scortching this
visions of the wave
Kiss, kiss into my heart
This way i can always undestand
Forever to die, forever to die and just
become
