Too much of a good thing
Was never nothing at all
The more you felt that need love
The more itÂ´s nothing at all
So just take your time
Oh yea thatÂ´s good
Cause too much of a good thing
Was always misundestood
The most important thing
Is that you blow your sea
And watch it ride
Run, run like a racehorce runs
YouÂ´re coming down on the floor
ItÂ´s not at all what you need so bad
But now you always want more
So just take your time
Oh yeah thatÂ´s good
I know you wanna be
I know you wanna be
So just take your time
Oh yeah thatÃ§s good
The most important thing
Is that you blow you sea
