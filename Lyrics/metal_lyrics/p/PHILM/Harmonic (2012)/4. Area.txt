ThereÂ´s so much on you
You canÂ´t believe your mind
So much on you now
So spread your wings and fly
You try to fly, youÂ´ll fly
But where will we ever go from here
You try to fly, you fly
But where will we ever go from here
I know just where weÂ´ll go from here
ThereÂ´s so much on you
Swimming in pools on your chest
So much on you now
Where the spiders make their nest
You try to fly, youÂ´ll fly
But where will we ever go from here
You try to fly, youÂ´ll fly
But where will we ever go from here
I know just where weÂ´ll go from here
Born in seven areas
Born in seven areas
