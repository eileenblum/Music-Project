I see lights
Red, green, pink and blue
I see lights
Their web is bled untrue right through
This city!

Right through!! [x4]

I see lights
Then a man beaten black and blue
Hearts of coal
I say "why?" He says "I was not in their crew"

It's rotten!
The streets are roamed by marching feet and fools
It's rotten!
They leave their mark upon this furrowed brow
It's rotten!
And there's no silence like a roaring crowd
It's rotten!
They pave their way to what they see
It's rotten!

Right through!! [x4]

Smoke comes out that cafÃ¨
Got enough Euros and you'll get laid
Mugged, beaten or squashed like a snail
Under the foot of malice
n those evil-soaked streets
A rotten, torn and putrid feel
Verminous hate beings, flapping their wings
Pave the way for horror and decay

Right through!! [x6]

I see lights (right through!)
I see lights (right through!)
I see lights (right through!)
I see lights (right through!)
I see lights
The streets are roamed by marching feet and fools (right through!)
I see lights
They leave their mark upon this furrowed brow (right through!)
I see lights
And there's no silence like a roaring crowd (right through!)
I see lights
(right through!)

I see lights!
