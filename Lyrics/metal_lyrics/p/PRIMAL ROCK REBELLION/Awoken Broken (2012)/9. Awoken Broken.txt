Scream into my bed, into the air
Searching for some light

Screaming mess I fell onto a carousel
To feel this nightmare bite

Awake in pure love for those close
Awake in pure love for those close
Awake to see the smiling ghost
The smiling ghost, the smiling ghost

Scream out blue sky bird
Scream into the night (all night)
Scream into my bed
Shiver up the sweating walls 

Scream out! Awoken Broken!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
Scream out! Awoken Broken! 
Scream out!

Screaming in despair
Into the night brisk air
Searching for some light
Screaming mess I fell onto a carousel
To feel this nightmare bite 

Awake in pure love for those close
Awake in pure love for those close
Awake to see the smiling ghost
The smiling ghost, the smiling ghost

Scream out blue sky bird
Scream into the night (all night)
Scream into my bed
Shiver up the sweating walls 

Scream out! Awoken Broken!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
Scream out! Awoken Broken! 
Scream out! 

Scream out! Awoken broken!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
Scream out! Awoken broken!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
Scream out! Awoken broken!
Scream out! Awoken broken! 
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
In the middle of the mud, in a puddle of pain!
