At last, the weather shines
I smell the summer in the drains
Oh, at last the weather shines
I smell the summer
Through the streets and lanes

At last, I smile together
With the mirror and the moon

But it seems she's only inspired
When she's being ignored, when she's being ignored 

Well, I found some joy that I wanted to share with her
But it seems that my sadness connected more
I wanted to share this light, for I know now
The darkness is soon to come.

My smile wants to fly
My smile wanted to float
With the mirror and the moon
With the woman who came too soon, too soon...

At last, the weather shines
I smell the summer from the drains
And now maybe I can try
To heal those eyes and turn the page

Then we could smile together
With the mirror and the moon
We could smile together
With the mirror and the moon.
