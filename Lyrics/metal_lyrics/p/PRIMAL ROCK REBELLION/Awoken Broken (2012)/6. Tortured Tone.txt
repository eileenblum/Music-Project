I heard her on the phone
Shielded, but alone
She slurred a tortured tone
I can hear the rain splash on the ground

She swam through darkness into light
Then fell back into the hell of night
She searched for colors in the grey
Then swam back into that old misery

Now that dress is in the gutter
The tears have all but gone
Now that dress is in the gutter
The tears have all but gone

The hate for herself grows
The shell she hides in knows
She built an alternate world
Full of vampires, cocks and crows

A place where she can go
Self-loathe all alone
Oh, she's not been at home for so long
She's not been at home...

Where did your heart go?
The glow seemed to freeze in snow
Under you wild skies
The rain waits for thee

Where did that heart go?
Her rain soon froze into snow
Sorrow fuelled brown eyes
Kept speaking in my dreams 

It was a stone cold realisation
When I heard her speak alone
Oh, when you live your life through escapism eyes
You'll find it hard to heal as the pain sinks deeper within you... 

Where did your heart go?
The glow seemed to freeze in snow
Under you wild skies
The rain waits for thee

Where did your heart go?
The glow seemed to freeze in snow
Under you wild skies
The rain waits for thee 
Where did your heart go?
The glow seemed to freeze in snow
Under you wild skies
The rain waits for thee
