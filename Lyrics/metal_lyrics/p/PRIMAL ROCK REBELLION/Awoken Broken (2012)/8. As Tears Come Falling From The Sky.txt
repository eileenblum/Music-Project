I lay now behind windows under a spring sky
The robins and the rains, the lorries and the trains go by
No raincot needed, not even for my eyes
Just seems to stay and swell in rhyme
My light is on, the cars hum by
As tears come falling from the sky

Radiators, ink-stained papers, mixers, makers, undertakers
The birds will sing on the dawn of spring
No need for any tanning products for my skin
As I lay now on a mattress, behind windows,
Behind curtains, behind windows, behind curtains
Behind windows, behind curtains

I be the hermit, you be the blue tit
Wander with me while I scour the sky
Today sees a new day
Light of that rainbow seems higher than the rain
As tears come drizzling in my drain.
