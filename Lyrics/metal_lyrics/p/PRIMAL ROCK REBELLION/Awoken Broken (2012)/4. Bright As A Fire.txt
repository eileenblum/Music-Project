Maybe you were someone you didn't like too much
Maybe you were somebody you wouldn't care to touch
Maybe you were someone you didin't know so well
Were you somebody who couldn't help but dwell in their own heaven.

Why don't you come to a place you can gleam
Into my arms and out of the sheen?
I want to lift you up my onlu love
I want you to see the light in your own world

In the forest I sang
For another hand to flow into my own
The lady came without a word, she explained
Every other heart was stone

And when the lake is alight
The flames they kiss, they bite
The bodies are entwined

The birds they fly
The broken they do cry
Alone in bed all asking "why?"

Bright as a fire
And wild as the sea
Try to get further
From the cloud over thee

I look in your eyes so grey
But I know that
A flower is behind

Just the colour needs to heal
But then you turn around to find another frown
A grey town, a hurting heart
A busy head can't sleep in its own bed tonight

Wanting, waiting, then trying to help thee
Finding the sweet angel in your eyes 

Bright as a fire
And wild as the sea
Try to get further
From the cloud over thee [x2]

It's your soul, it's your soul, it's your soul!!

You had the desire
To fly up higher
Into the light

You searched within the mire
To be inspired
Out of that haze.

To beam good energy from
Your soul and become
The being you wanted to...

To beam good energy from
Your soul and become
The being you are now through.

It's your soul, it's your soul, it's your soul!

Bright as a fire
And wild as the sea
Try to get further
From the cloud over thee [x3]
