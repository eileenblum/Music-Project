[Japanese Bonus Track]The scientist walked into a room
He knows the floor was cleaned earlier that day
With the same bucket of water he threw upon his own car
The vehicle that got him to and from his work
He understood all of this.

The scientist then walked into his garage
Seeing a painting of the sky
Then a trail of ants heading for the blackcurrant juice
Spilt earlier that day
He took a cloth, mopped it up and they all went away

He understood what he thought he should to satisfy his mind
He built a wall around his mind, his feelings he can't hide

He won't believe what he can't see
Always waiting for fact to speak
Woooaaoo ooo ooo aaa oooh
He cannot leave this wall of sleep

Is what you see real?
When you just can't explain?
You say your mind's playing tricks now
In your touch can you feel within?
Now, how do you explain the burn from sin?
A big bang, you say, a birth, but what was there
before this fragile earth?
You understand the gland and gland, making love
and holidays in sald
Talking to trees, finding keys
A love within and out and in an out
A man with the answer, plaster the wax,
gather the facts, as the dogs lose cats
A war of wings, an engile flings feathers from
the high sky demon

A will to leave is a while away
A will to leave is a while away

An open mind is in a different play
An open mind is in a different play

An open mind is in a different play
An open mind is in a different play

The scientist sits on his couch, his television
screaming "War! War! War!" 
Shows people crying far away, untrusting eyesthat
spread decay
Oh, the tears dry up once the button is pushed
Famine comes from lack of food
He understood all of this. 

He understood what he thought he should to satisfy his mind
He built a wall around his mind, his feelings he can't hide

He won't believe what he can't see
Always waiting for fact to speak
Woooaaoo ooo ooo aaa oooh
He cannot leave this wall of sleep [x2]
