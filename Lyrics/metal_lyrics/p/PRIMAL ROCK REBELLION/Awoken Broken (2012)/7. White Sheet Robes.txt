Where has he gone to?
I have not seen him in years, years
Where is my friend gone now?
I can see his skin, but not within, no.

They had to stop his mind from sinking
Into a it of horror
Trying to control his thoughts from slipping
Into caves of hysteria

He lost his clothes
To the wihte sheet robes
As they said they would show him towards the light
Oh, he was drugged up and lost in a colossal course of pills
Starting to loose the fight within himself.

When the light turned grey it trickled
Into thought suppression
Within his eyes, within his mind
Always the same reaction

Where has my friend gone
I can see his skin, but not within, no.

He lost his clothes
To the wihte sheet robes
As they said they would show him towards the light
Oh, he was drugged up and lost in a colossal course of pills
Starting to loose the fight within himself. 

Is it always right for the state of mind to rely on chemicals?
It's easier to ignore than battle problems through
Is it easier to create a swamp or is ignorance just cruel
To settle a man into a well and take away his fuel?

Where has he gone to?
In a maze, a placid haze
No fear, no tears.

It may have been the right way at first, for a while
But he's been in a bubble for far too long
Where's the great adventurer I knew? 

He lost his clothes
To the wihte sheet robes
As they said they would show him towards the light
Oh, he was drugged up and lost in a colossal course of pills
Starting to loose the fight within himself. [x2]
