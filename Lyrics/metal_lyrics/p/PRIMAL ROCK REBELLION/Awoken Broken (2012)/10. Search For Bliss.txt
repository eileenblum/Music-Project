Love bloomed so soon then it had to leave
Like a door shutting beside me
Now I don't have the key to go back and see
Well, I tried to search for some bliss
But it's all the waking in the week alone
And now I see
As I flied and you drifted away
And it was all in you
And what we had
That could make our dreaming true
A dream I've never seen into

Where's the king and who's the clown
You wanna sail 'til the dream is over
Now the sky just seems to flow
You wanna wait 'til the week is over

Back into that room, I fell on my knees
Still the black clouds all over me
Like a sunken sea , like a tortured tree
Well, I tried to search for some bliss
But it's all the waking in the week alone
And now I see
As I flied and you drifted away
And it was all in you
And what we had were the pieces
That could make our dreaming true
A dream I've never seen into 

Where's the king and who's the clown
You wanna sail 'til the dream is over
Now the sky just seems to flow
You wanna wait 'til the week is over 
The search for bliss falls to the ground
You wanna sail 'til the dream is over
And keep on searching for the four leaf clover.

In the wilderness I wander
As thunder takes her away
Now those tears come crashing
on this concrete again.

I fly for you, my dear 
As the concrete sneers, floating away again
Then the spear of destiny inflamed
I see the light, but not the day

Where's the king and who's the clown
You wanna sail 'til the dream is over
Now the sky just seems to flow
You wanna wait 'til the week is over 
The search for bliss falls to the ground
You wanna sail 'til the dream is over

And keep on searching for the four leaf clover.
