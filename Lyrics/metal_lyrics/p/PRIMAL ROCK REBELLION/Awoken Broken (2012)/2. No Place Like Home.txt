Well, I go into town today
It's city smog and city ways
Every eye is on the floor
Trying so hard to ignor
You gotta watch your back and be aware
Blood runs cold, then disappears
There's soot and sadness in the air
No-one even seem to care.

Do you wanna hover
Towards the air of sumer
To love within the land
Oh, they say there ain't no place like home?
But it ain't here
No, it's nowhere near
I need to find that shore
Oh, they say there's no place like home.

Well, I get back upon the train
It's dark and duller shades of grey
Those wings I see go flapping by
Those pigeons swarm then learn to cry
City smog and city smoke
Sky looks it's about to choke
On soot and sadness in the air
No-one even seem to care.

Do you wanna hover 
Towards the air of sumer
To love within the land
Oh, they say there ain't no place like home?
But it ain't here
No, it's nowhere near
I need to find that shore
Oh, they say there's no place like home. 

Yea, they feed off fear 
Oh yea, they feed off fear
Why can't they go?
Oh, there ain't no place like home [x2]
