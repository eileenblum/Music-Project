There's a man in the park, waking his dog to a mark
In the picture he painted, in the picture he painted
And the people look on, and the people look one
But their fears haven't gone and they are right to be so
Then a gang comes along, steals all he owns
Then they carry on, roaming all day long.

To the eyes of a television inspired mess
From a pub to a club to a street to a thug
Ignoring the light from above
Ignoring the light from above
Fight or surrender, no friendly neighbour
The butcher and the baker and the mixer and the maker

It's a battle with the wind
On my neck and in my eyes
With the crows looking at the wallet that rest above my thigh
Come up to me with a knife and a can
With the words "give me what you got"
Holding out a hand, NO! 

To the eyes of a television inspired mess (NO!)
From a pub to a club to a street to a thug
Ignoring the light from above (NO!)
Ignoring the light from above (NO!)
Fight or surrender, no friendly neighbour
The butcher and the baker and the mixer and the maker 

Can't find any mirror that shines...

To the eyes of a television inspired mess (grey into blue)
From a pub to a club to a street to a thug (grey into blue)
Ignoring the light from above
Ignoring the light from above
Is it the maker in you, or someone you knew?
The one who can turn the grey into blue?
