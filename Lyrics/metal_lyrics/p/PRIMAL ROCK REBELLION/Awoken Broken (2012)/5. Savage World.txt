This fountain is a sewer now
A flower withered on the ground
Pick a tick between the bricks
A stain to sink them limp

Around the town with frowns and clowns
Every step I seem to take
These pigeons roams in packs no slack
From where they are and where they think it's at 

If I can fly away, then show me the door
To escape this hole and not come back no more
These roads are plagued, beaten and sore
It's a savage world they all seem to adore

The mountains you don't try to climb
The streets you dwell so well and find
All left rotting plagued with ticks
Inch by inch then slip

You call yourself a macho man
I know you came here with a plan
Drink and drink, then fight then drink
Then all go back into that routine

If I can fly away, then show me the door
To escape this hole and not come back no more
These roads are plagued, beaten and sore
It's a savage world they all seem to adore 

To disappear into a cloud,
Wake up in some other distant town.

I don't really know
Why they feed off hate and spread such fear
Oh, they never seem to go
As the mud flows through those lanes again
Well, I just wanted to sail
So, so far away
Well, I just wanted to go
But there's too many ticks on the side of me now.

Around the town with frowns and clowns
Every step I seem to take
These pigeons roams in packs no slack
From where they are and where they think it's at 

If I can fly away, then show me the door
To escape this hole and not come back no more
These roads are plagued, beaten and sore
It's a savage world they all seem to adore [x2]

To disappear into a cloud,
Wake up in some other distant town.
To disappear into a cloud,
Find that suddenly you've lost your frown.
