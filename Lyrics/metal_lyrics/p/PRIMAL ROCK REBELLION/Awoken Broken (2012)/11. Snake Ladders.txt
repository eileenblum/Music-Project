I don't need your salt rubbed in my wounds
I won't try and tell you what you sould be or do
You dwell in your own tree and IÃ¬ll leave you that way
Now walk through the jungle of mystery
"Who goes there?" you cried out to the night
A snake appeared ahead with demonic eyes, he said
"Hey come follow me, I'll show you the way"
You said "OK, I'll do anything you say"

There ain't no love in the air you breathe
There ain't no fire in the hearts you leave
Try to reminisce of how things used to be
Before you climb so high on that darkened tree 

The snake slithered on through the jungle
You followed, but tightly in your palm, holding a rock
Waiting for your moment, yea.
At last you reached the river
It was a beautiful waterfall, but nowhere to cross
He turned and said "we must wait here for the boatman"
As he turned back, you cracked him over the head
and tossed him into the water
He was no use to you anymore.

There ain't no love in the air you breathe
There ain't no fire in the hearts you leave
Try to reminisce of how things used to be
Before you climb so high on that darkened tree [x2]

At last the boatman came
Over at him you waved shouting
"Please take me to the other side"
Boatman looked up and said "OK come take a ride"
You then asked "Have you any food?"
And then he smiled saying
"Yea, I do, why don't you come stay with me for a while"
(If you need a place to crash a while) 
Nights and days went by, and closer you became
Until you found a map of that goldmine

Off you ran into the midst of night
'til you come to a crooked old bridge
You weren't to know it was far too weak
As you fell into the rapids below
Then trying to swim up and over to the other side
Eventually, you pulled yourself out
Then staring back at a reflection into your own eyes
Screaming and wailing in the night 

There ain't no love in the air you breathe
There ain't no fire in the hearts you leave
Try to reminisce of how things used to be
Before you climb so high on that darkened tree [x3]

There ain't no love
There ain't no love
There ain't no fire
There ain't no fire
Try to reminisce of how things used to be
Before you climb so high on that darkened tree.
