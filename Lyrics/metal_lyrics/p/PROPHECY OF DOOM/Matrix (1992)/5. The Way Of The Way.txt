So this is your now
What was done? When? Why? And how?

There's so much to do to make you belong
But that which is "right" can also be wrong
The way through the way, intuition not force
Convenience and distractions must be razed at your source
Hysteria will taint all prospect of removal
So this clone need not fight as it has your approval
Ideals filtered out by the crude egoist offender
Leaving your dross of token existence now compelled to surrender
Our minds of duality now corrode under the strain
Remember the again and make luxury from pain
Mind your mind and regain through sustain
The reality of Matrix - it's there to obtain
Is this your now?
