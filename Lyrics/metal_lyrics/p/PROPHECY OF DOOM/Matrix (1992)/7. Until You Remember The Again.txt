Your progression stands still
Through distractions you are caught
Without action theory stays lifeless
Like famine remaining food for thought

Now the sign of the times reads nowhere you'll look for the again
When you arrive early just to kill time you'll need the again

Remember what you have just done
As the again is what then will come
The former is chosen by your ego rival
The latter is ignored to maintain its survival

Now the sign of the times reads nowhere you'll look for the again
When you arrive early just to kill time you'll need the again

Endless promises of progression
This intention a thought sincere
Inside your mind you the hostage may hide
But the siege remains, and near
When you hold your mind to ransom
The currency is fear
