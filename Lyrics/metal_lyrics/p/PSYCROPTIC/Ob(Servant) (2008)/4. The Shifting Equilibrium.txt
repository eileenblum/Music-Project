Mocked and discarded,
Treated as an inferior by-product
By a society drunk on the power of progression
'Collateral Damage' in a patronising age

A multitude of the newly evolved
They are the bright beacon of a dark future
A glimpse of what will become
The peak of mankind is lower than assumed
A new genetic equilibrium is forming

As nature corrects itself
Discarding core functions that mankind have neglected
Arrogance and apathy the culprit
New generations replace the values of the old
Non-essential human elements enhanced
As the correction takes place.

A slow and cruel process, this cannot be reversed
They will create a twisted balance of power
Becoming the majority, their numbers multiplying
Gradually outnumbering those who deem themselves as the norm,
Uprooting all that is held sacred to an ego

Driven mass
Nothing can curb the spiral effect
Your future kin will become "Them"
Tainted decedents will usher in the new era
