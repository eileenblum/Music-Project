Manipulation of evolution
Against all that is natural
A course uncharted
Creating that which was once revered by all
Becoming the one to oppose what has always been
The Pinnacle

Reconstructing the elemental nature of Life
A transcendence with no recourse
Time, no longer the restrictive force
Time, no longer the constant
The pendulum has stopped.

By removing the balancing factor
I rise about the homogeneous
We are equals no more
With the common bond of death removed

I stand alone.
Alone in Power.
Alone in Stature.
Alone.

Time is now irrelevant
The invisible structure long ago destroyed
I cannot undo what has been done
A selfish dream that has turned
Into an unwanted reality
Waiting for that which will never come
Without an end, how can "Life" exist?

Now I Just Am
I Am Eternal
I am Nothing
