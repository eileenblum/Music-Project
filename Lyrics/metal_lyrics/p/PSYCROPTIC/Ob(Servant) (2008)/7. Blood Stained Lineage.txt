Correct mistakes of blood
Follow the ruler to usurp the crown
Take what is not bestowed by lineage
Take what can never be handed
The averted gaze of arrogance; ripe for the knife

Flinch not
Carve a new future
Forge it by force

Hesitate now and forever wait
For that which will not come again
A lost opportunity to sculpt a new hierarchy
To become the catalyst, not the witness
Blood stained hands can be cleansed
Indictable traces removed, disposed
Neither black nor white exists when you dwell in the shade

Answerable to None
A forced superiority; the Universal Effect
The transfer of power absolute
Slaves will forever remain slaves
Kings will forever walk among kings

Standing alone, never as One
For the weak will drain all from what they covet
Become the ruler of all and want for nothing.
