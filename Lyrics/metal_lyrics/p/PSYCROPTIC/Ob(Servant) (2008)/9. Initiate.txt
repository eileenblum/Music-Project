Stripped of all that is unique, it is redundant
You have joined us, Welcome...
Embrace the new freedom of which you have never felt
Embrace the Nothingness
The sinister burden of individuality lifted
Embrace Us

You need struggle no longer
We offer what you have long yearned for
You will become complete
Now part of our family
Revel without our created monotheistic system
All else is false

You have chosen what is right
You have chosen what is true
You have accepted the inevitable
Adorned with the sacred cloth
You are now our brothers and sisters
Forget your past, repent
We forgive you

For you knew nothing else
Pure savages now tamed
We will guide your future
Together we move toward
All outsiders must fear us

Icons of dissent must fall, the great unclean herded
Those suitable, welcomed... Failures, discarded
Our invitation needs no reply
Vengeance awaits the chosen who doubt, refuse or mock.
We insure this, you will insure this
We cannot be faulted, we are immaculate
Values bond us closer than blood
Our family is ever growing
We will continue to do what is right:
Cleansing the Profane
