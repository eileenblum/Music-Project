Your life turned to rubble
Face the fact that it won't get better
Your fault your choices
How long can you keep it up now
The illusion seen through eventually
Your fault your choices

Fire of time burning faster
Wicks burning out so where to now
Seek pity from those around you
Age isn't slowing down now
It's time to look this in the eye
Leading to this conclusion

This cold dark hell
 Reaching for you
Who'll save you now and why
No one is left, all driven away
You made your own path
Time to walk it

The emptiness comes through
Fight to the light comes faster than ever
Cold heart cold soul
Like a vice it grips it tighter
When does it end and what will come next
Cold heart cold soul

This cold dark hell
 Reaching for you
Who'll save you now and why
No one is left, all driven away
You made your own path
Time to walk it

Left it too late
Should've realized
It passed so quick
Death's forever
What's done is done
Can't change it now
Be over soon
Sleep forever
