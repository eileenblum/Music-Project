Is this what people want to see
Smoke rising from beneath the core
Empowered by the wealth, it rapes the land
What the future brings none of us could know
It's as if we deny the truth we know
How could this not have repercussions
Things are needed to keep the balance of power

Do you think this just keeps happening
Coincidently never been like this before
A type of knowledge yet ignorant
So naive
Alternative things we have in abundance
Sustainable actions to be taken

So what you say what do you want from me
It's not my concern
For future generations it shall be
Protect your lineage

Why is it so that we can't agree on shit
Abundant wealth, how much is enough?
What's the number where it all will stop
No end keep pillaging
Policies and words mean nothing to me
Feeble lines to stop the questions
Never knowing how far it goes
Hands in pockets since the dawn of time

Is this what people want to see
Disasters striking near and afar
We remember the time as before
A simple mistake can have great effects
No denying the truth we know
The repercussions raise their heads again
Heating up and it's not reversible!

So what you say what do you want from me
It's not my concern
For future generations it shall be
Protect your lineage
Hell on earth is being created
Whose fault is this?
This is not why we're created
Some job we've done

So they say it's how it's supposed to be
We know the truth we've caused this
Time to make a change, it needs to end
Or the end will strike upon us first
