Internal conflict causing great despair
War ravaged lands everywhere you look
Reigning down on them like a storm of hate
Force their way through it so desperately
Escape the only option thatâs possible
But no one will help and nobody cares
Why is this happening and whatâs the cause
Needs to be stopped whatâs the answer now

More destructions not the answer
Why canât they come to their senses

There needs to be action taken
Support given without hidden agendas
So quick to use extreme measures
Try the mind instead of the fists first
Who decides who lives or who dies 
The same answer given time and time again
One person holding so much power
A deadly game of cat and mouse

Assistance to these people offered by no one
Stone age, what day we living in
Howâd it begin and whenâs it gonna end
Life holds no value to those put in charge
The throw away world taken to extreme
Authority the problem, whatâs the game plan here
Centuries of torment and stripped of basic rights

More destructions not the answer
Why canât they come to their senses

Whenâs it going to end 
I doubt in our life time
The need for control
Means more than peopleâs lives
