See what, say what, they want never
Come out striking to whatever
Look out, look up, eyes opening now

Again to see the days alight
Set fire to the skies
The night and day's the same
And everything must change

Misconception of what life is
Endless circle, chasing mindless fortunes
That will not bring minds to ease
Gaining success off a number
Always leading to deception
What's these, why these desperate measures
False

Again to see the days alight
Set fire to the skies
The night and day's the same
And everything must change

You come to me with your lies
Preach sorrow your desperate disguise
Manipulate seeking pity
Days numbered exposing true self

Again to see the days alight
Set fire to the skies
The night and day's the same
And everything must change

You know inside what you seek
Hatred you're blinded to it
Life's cheap to you, no guilt felt
Conscience does not exist here
Sentenced to this timeless struggle
Always hunting for something not there

You come to me with your lies
Preach sorrow your desperate disguise
Manipulate seeking pity
Days numbered exposing true self
