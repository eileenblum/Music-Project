Gracious is the moment of the last breath to be had
Seek refuge in the past memories
Solitude it grows deep entwining around one's thoughts
No end to cycles, vicious circles

Endless wandering desperate for an end
Last of a kind, cannot pretend
Glory once had grown weary with age
How can it stop forever enraged

There must be a way, it's not possible
Counting down the days until the answer's found
Sorrow grows into a desperate cry for help
No answers, what's the solution now

Journey to the centre of the frostbitten realms
In search for souls long forgotten

Endless wandering desperate for an end
Last of a kind, cannot pretend
Glory once had grown weary with age
How can it stop forever enraged

The sympathy of the ageless gods we seek
Forced to lurk in shadows
Forever cold in time
Await new sentence to pass down

Can't make it end by his own two hands
Fire engulfs the night what sign is this
Bowing down to beg forgiveness now
Crimes so long before the recording of years

Ice ravaged landscapes across the mountain top
Paths lead to nowhere, in this frozen world
Black sky surrounding, searching the moonlight
Forthcoming in shadows, what can be found

The deep caverns reveal
A light so blinding
The symbol of time
Await new sentence to pass down
