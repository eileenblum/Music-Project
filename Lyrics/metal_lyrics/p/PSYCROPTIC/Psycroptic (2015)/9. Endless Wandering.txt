Never known how it came to this
Struck down in a cold dark world
No exit - no escape is how it seems now
Aimless wandering through your mind's eye
Try to capture a breath in the wind
Avoid the challenge - the hardened truth
Can't hide forever

There's no escape
Don't cry to me, I'm not your friend
These darkened tales they can't be stopped

A sleepless dream world can't feel what's real
The nights all seem to be the same
The world was once in the palm of your hand
Where has it gone now

There's no escape
Don't cry to me, I'm not your friend
These darkened tales they can't be stopped
We are the same
You'll never lose me, we are one
The more you try the harder you'll fall

Accept your life no need to pretend
We won't forget
This sleepless world ends not with me
You will see
Once desperately roaming in the fog
Come walk with me
The remedy
Human elements stripped back to an empty shell
