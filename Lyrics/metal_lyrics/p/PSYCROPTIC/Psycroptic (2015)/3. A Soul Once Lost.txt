Pity, there is no need for this
Comfort in their eyes
Forced down for mercy no
Sleeping patiently await
Time for resurrection soon
Days ahead bring change in hand

Time is growing closer now
So raise your fisted hand
We sleep no longer now
So go forth with no remorse
And never show restraint
As they will not pray for your souls

What you seek beyond this wall
Liberation so close you can smell
Last chance, a final attempt

Time is growing closer now
So raise your fisted hand
We sleep no longer now
So go forth with no remorse
And never show restraint
As they will not pray for your souls

Destined for this life beyond
In time we search through desperately
It seems this side will reign again
A time that lights our souls with pride

Set sail and never look back
Push forward, see what lay ahead
Hold tight, don't loosen our grip
Achieve anything
