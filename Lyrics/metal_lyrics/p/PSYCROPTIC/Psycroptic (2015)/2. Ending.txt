The signs of life they fade into worlds below
As fire cleanses the earth
The path once trodden above
Is crumbled and broken now

There's no saving grace at this moment now
Search is over what's done is done now
No forgiveness, glory days are over
Nothing left now, should have listened

Sucked dry of the will to survive
Precious moments, just waiting to die

The days got short, they fell
 Into darkened skies
And the glaciers melted
The heat turned all to dust
Like plagues from the ancient times

There's no saving grace at this moment now
Search is over what's done is done now
No forgiveness, glory days are over
Nothing left now, should have listened

Sucked dry of the will to survive
Precious moment, just waiting to die
Stand still for the waking of day
Will only bring terror, death and decay

Shoul've known, should've done
All too late now, all the signs there for years
Listened way too late
Only moments till the end
Prepare yourselves time is now
Flames are rising, where is your god now
Need for control, ends it for humanity
