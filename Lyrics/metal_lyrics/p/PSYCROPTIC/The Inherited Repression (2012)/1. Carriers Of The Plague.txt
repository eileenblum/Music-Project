On the throne of the elite
Shunning the deviates, so proud and holy
You would always fall
Never to remember the gloating

Holding a skeleton key - key to salvation
It was only time that stood in the way

Of the great revelation
Where science and the spirit collide
A crossroad leading to the same answer

One and the same
A fact that shattered the illustrious grandeur
You so forcefully shared
Carriers of the plague

This living contradiction sparked
An organic deterioration never witnessed

Originating from within
You carried the plague to your flock
Bodies in rejection
Slowly ridding the filth

Purged of their very essence
It was you who turned them caustic, infecting them
Confusing them with this horrid sentence

No longer whole
Lamenting what you all once were
The simple ways gone
In its place an uncertain destiny

This science fact turning you into a fraud
You should have never tampered with your core
Genetics would always succumb
Under the weight of the human repression
Carriers of the plague
