Lost - you take comfort in lies
For this a grave mistake for these times
In gathered diluted thoughts
Past comprehensions from signs

Such came from knowledge
Of an inclement state of
Periodic euphoria
Once found can never return

So it once was lost in
Realms of wayward plains
Now is time for research
Comfort once, now in such shame

In time - effects of this device
Taken over lengths of time will deny
Once sane minds
Will be corrupted by
Delusions of
An unforgiving day

This is: what was then
Time cannot stand still
So it: now become
So what have I become

So it once was lost in
Realms of wayward plains
Now is time for research
Comfort once, now in such shame
