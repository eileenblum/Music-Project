Thoughts are not
So easily subdued
Look through these eyes
Things in your mind
Easily destroy you
Come with me

The pain of things once done
Shall never be taken back
The strive for better being
Personality of man
Can never be understood
Why self-destruction

Destruction imminent
You know you cannot win
The more that you fight
The stronger the urges get
To cause self-failure
Never winning this game in your head

What is this chaos inside me
So hard to believe that it's me
It's a driving force that's beneath me
The way out I can't possibly see

Forced deprivation of idealistic thoughts
The cause of what is inclement to me
Take a step forward to no return
Put down by force, no more oppression

Intrepid state in violation
You'll be back, it's so easy to see
Two steps forward yet three steps back
Cannot win such oppression

Thoughts are not
So easily subdued
Look through these eyes

I know you know what is coming around
This is habit
Don't say I won't, this is just lies
Lying to yourself

Thoughts are not
So easily subdued
Look through these eyes
Things in your mind
Easily destroy you
Come with me
