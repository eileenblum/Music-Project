Bounded since birth
To a master never revealed
I have been enslaved
Hidden beneath a deep cosmic veil
Flickers of reason, clouded by doubt
Truths that lay dormant
Now remembered

A crisis ensuing within my mind
Conflicting duality, illogical reality
Everything once known is wrong
Denial, despair, desperation
I can not make this insanity stop

A sleeper has awoken
Awake! A sleeper no more
Validation... vindication
For once a fraudulent life
Seeing the five universal laws are really eight

Eating away at a once sane mind
This reality is coming to an end
You cannot ignore the truth
And the truth will set you free...
This is what I have always been told
This is what I always believed

A sleeper has awoken
Awake! A sleeper no more
Validation... vindication
For once a fraudulent life
Seeing the five universal laws are really eight

My new knowledge, our new power
We are now in control

New senses awake, a species reborn
Nothing can stand in our path

Life now balanced, minds set free
We were not ready for this...
A knowledge so true, so pure; it poisons us

The body can't keep such knowledge contained
Our only way to survive
Cast away all reason
Smart enough to know
We aren't smart enough for this...
