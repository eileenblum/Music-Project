Treachery - seeking pleasure in mournful eyes
You never know what is round the corner
Lurking in depths lies a fateful karma
Creeping upon you like a spiteful plague
Taking you down further disposition
No one to help, you fucked up everything
Lavation that is installed upon us
Once come in waves, now a hoarded wealth

Covered with lies
I never thought it would come to this
The desperation
I never thought it would be like this

Tried to bribe us
With feeble aggregations
Some fell for it
But most saw through it

Deception - and the rate is rising
Hatred toward you only growing stronger
Pretentiousness, you never knew the other side
Pain inflicted only fuels our anger

Tried to bribe us
With feeble aggregations
Some fell for it
But most saw through it

In this day and age your intentions will fail
The greed and corruption will come into dismay
Coming in forward we reach for the facts
These hidden fortunes will be illuminated

Now is time for a change
No hope left for us now
