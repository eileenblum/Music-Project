Thrones waged upon blood
The march is never-ending
Victor unknown
Endless power struggle

Who comes with me
Marching forward to the unknown depths
Who stakes a claim
The legions' word shall live forever
Destination unknown
Like an epidemic, take these lands by storm
Breaking their wills
Convert them to the word of the kings

Thrones waged upon fear
Follow the words from before us
Who knows right from wrong
Further we fall down this hole

Led on this path
Bodies broken
Cause yet unknown
Fighting for what reason
Slipping into
Grip from beyond
This tyrant needs blood
Stripped of moral dignity

Questions can't be answered
This life is not for me
Why can't they see what we see
Greed is all they need
Conflict hides the real needs
Fame and fortune he seeks
Unacceptable losses of life

Thrones waged upon fear
Follow the words from before us
Who knows right from wrong
Further we fall down this hole

Who comes with me
Marching forward to the unknown depths
Who stakes a claim
The legions' word shall live forever
Destination unknown
Like an epidemic, take these lands by storm
Breaking their wills
Convert them to the word of the kings
