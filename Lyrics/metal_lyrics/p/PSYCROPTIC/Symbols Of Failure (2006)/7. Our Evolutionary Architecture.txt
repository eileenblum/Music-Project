A virus unnoticed.
Now ingrained in us all For we are not what we appear to be...
This is the fundamental nature of the syndrome.
A plague presenting a new means of being: of which has never been witnessed.
Nothing.
To alleviate the effect...
Oblivious, relieved of our true awareness; replaced with a new script for our futures:
Puppets for a twisted play.
With humanity as the lead.
Spread with such an aggressive velocity:
Concealed within the natural magnetic properties of the earth.
A unique catalyst: an efficient method to spread infection.
We were all contaminated within an instant...
The entire populous: with no immunity...
Our bodies rendered void: our minds unaware.
In harmony we fell where we stood...
Motionless, switched into a dreamlike state.
Our tangible existence replaced...
Oblivious: we carry on with our now illusionary life.
However, we are the ignorant architects: damned for us, we are smarter than we think.
This virus spawned because of a need.
It was the logical evolutionary step for humanity.
It is what we (internally) desired...
Evolution.
Simply making efficient the lives we catty out
The trivial distraction that is life, prevented us from noticing, the gradual change...
Collectively, we longed for an amendment (to life).
Easier...
Simple...
Apathetic.
Uncultivated areas of our brain the silent nursery.
Natural magnetic waves that circle out world, creating a linked community:
Linking us all without awareness, nurturing the 'virus': the evolutionary solution.
Continually developing.
Continually refining, methodically approaching the required developed state.
What happens now as out bodies lie still?
A serene silence eclipsing the globe...
Our next stage of evolution is complete...
The human form more efficient than previously thought possible.
But, how long can the hosts of our new way of life sustain us?
Our mortal bodies...
Without nutritional replenishment surely we perish?
Is this an evolutionary flaw, of just a natural progression?
