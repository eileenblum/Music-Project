We're on the same quest to better understand ourselves
To understand the unknown
We're on the same quest to better understand ourselves
But when I search for answers all I find are more questions
When will we realize that we might never know!

Looking through the stained glass I see a distorted image of reality
Why won't you have faith in the things you cannot see?
We're on the same quest to better understand ourselves
But when I search for answers all I find are more questions
When will we realize that we might never know!

Sometimes along the road we're hindered by another blackened soul
And I'm so sick of not knowing about the, the UNFORESEEN!
THE UNFORESEEN!
Through the stained glass I see a distortions of reality
Remove the scales from my eyes
Remove the scales from my eyes
Remove the scales from my eyes
So I can start searching for the source of life
Remove the scales
Remove the scales
Remove the scales
Or remove my eyes
