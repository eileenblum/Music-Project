I lie awake thinking of your sweet face. How you raised me right, ready to fly on my own. Why has the time now come for us to part? Oh how I love you with all of my heart. I will love the way you taught me. I will live the way you showed me. I will take care of our family. I
will love the way you taught me. I will live the way you showed me.
Forever I will maintain your legacy.
