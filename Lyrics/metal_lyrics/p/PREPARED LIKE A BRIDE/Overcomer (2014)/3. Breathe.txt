Just breathe. When the air leaves your lungs and youâre holding on tightly. Suffocation will suck you dry and hang you out to freeze. Let the oxygen fill your lungs and feel the cold murmur of the breeze. In the tensest of moments all you have to do is breathe. Just breathe.
And when the air fills your lungs and you feel that sense of relief,just breathe. Just breathe and know the same air filling your lungs is inflating you and me. And when the world leaves you lonely and life feels nothing like the breeze. Remember todayâs a blessing, all
you have to do is breathe. Just breathe. Take a deep breath, let it sink in. Open your eyes, feel the breeze and breathe. Suffocation will suck you dry and hang you out to freeze. Just breathe.
