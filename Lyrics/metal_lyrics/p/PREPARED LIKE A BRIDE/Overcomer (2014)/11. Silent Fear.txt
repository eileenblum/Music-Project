In my head I wasnât good enough. In my head a war was brewing against me. All the things that I shouldâve done. All of them left me feeling so empty. Why should I have to feel this way? I thought we were all born the same. All born the same. The fear of fear is our
deepest failure. What is freedom if we live in silence? Why would you let the truth deny us? The fear of fear is what confines us. The fear of fear will not define us. You donât have to remind me. How pathetic my life might be. Either way I will continue fighting. You will
never get the best of me. You have nothing to offer me. Speak now or forever hold your peace. Youâd better bit your tongue.
You will never get the best of me. What is freedom if we live in silence? In a world so full of fear. What is freedom if we cannot speak? Why should I
have to feel this way? I thought we were all born the same. In a life where nothing's free. You have nothing to offer me. The fear of fear is our deepest failure.
What is freedom if we live in silence? Why would you let the truth deny us? The fear of fear is what confines us.
The fear of fear will not define us. You have nothing to offer me. I will dictate my own mindset.
