[feat. Landon Tewers]Have you ever been lost? Or were you taken? Have you ever been lost? Or were you taken? Trapped inside four walls for ten years. The truth stolen yet nobody hears. Would you make it out alive?
Do you have the strength to survive? Do you have the courage to find the strength
inside? Darkness in every corner. Loneliness never warmer. Step into my shoes and feel the terror run through your bones. Someone get me out of here alive. Day after day the doors closed still nobody. Will we ever make it out alive? Who will come? Still no one. We must hold
on, we must stay strong. In the end I know weâll make it out alive. Keep your chin up, keep your hopes high. I know someday we will see the sunshine. We will see the sunshine.
Through these curtains I am hurting. I am hurting. I may have been through hell and back. But I am
strong enough to walk through hell with a smile on my face,with my head held high. Iâm free now. To live my life on the outside. Iâm free now. I will not let the situation define who I am. I will define the situation.
I will define.
