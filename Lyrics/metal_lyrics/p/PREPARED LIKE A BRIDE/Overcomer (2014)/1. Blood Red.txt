Iâll bleed for what I believe. I don't care if youâre different than me, I really donât care if youâre different than me. Iâll bleed for what I believe. And youâll see, and youâll see you're no different than me. We bleed the same blood, we cry the same tears. We bleed,we
cry and live in the same time. With the same, with the same fears. This life will be blood red, when Iâm dead and gone. This life will be blood red, when I'm dead and gone. Iâll bleed for what I believe. Mark my words, I will stand with you or on my own. To see this
through. Mark my words, I will stand with you or on my own. To see this through. We bleed the same blood, we cry the same tears. We bleed, we cry and live in the same time. With the same, with the same fears. We bleed the same blood, we cry the same tears. One life blood
red.
Until Iâm dead, I will see this through. One life blood red.
