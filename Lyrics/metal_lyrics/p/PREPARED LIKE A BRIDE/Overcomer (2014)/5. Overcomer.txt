I am an overcomer. Itâs been a cold November. One that Iâll always remember. How is it that you were here with me just last night? And now youâre gone. We shared our final meal then you were carried away from me. I am an overcomer. It canât rain all the time, it won't hold
us down. I am an overcomer. I will fight till the end, forever by your side. I am an overcomer. It canât rain all the time. Your plane came down and I was too far away to help. I would have done anything, we would have done anything.
The wind picked up as the clouds rolled
in that day and now these tears burn my eyes. Iâve stood on the edge of eternity. Iâve looked death straight in the eye. It wonât hold us down. It canât rain all the time. So when the dust settles and the skies clear, will you come home? Will you voice echo through these
halls once more? Itâs been such cold November. We shared our final meal,one Iâll always remember. I am an overcomer. It canât rain all the time. It won't hold us down. I am an overcomer. I will fight till the end, forever by your side. I am an overcomer. I will carry the
flag, I will stand in the storm.
Itâs been a cold November. One Iâll always remember. One Iâll always remember.
It canât rain all the time. It wonât hold us down. I am an overcomer.
