Forgive me Iâm just speaking my mind.
Forgive me Iâm just speaking my mind. And I feel like Iâve got every reason to.
How could you take my father from me? How could you take my father from me?
Were you jealous of our love? Did you watch us from above until one day you'd had
enough? I canât see your plan in this and I donât feel your love right now.
I donât want to meet him as my brother. I just loved him as my father. How many nights Iâve cried myself to sleep and now I wake up and feel and emptiness inside of me. An emptiness that echoes Iâll
love you forever. I will love you,I will love you, I will you forever. We are all alone. We are all alone in this world. Because weâre all alone. No I love yous or goodbyes. I know you're waiting for me on the other side.
