Like an early morning sunrise in the middle of the night. The waves silencing my thoughts as I try to win this fight. I donât know where I am going or if I plan on coming back. The sea could take me under and paint my whole world black. Paint my world black. And keep me in
itâs current. Paint my world black. Maybe then Iâd know the feeling of fighting a sea in me. With a million feelings I would drown in self-pity. Like an ocean tide come and dwell inside and wash away the pain. Wash away. Please wash away the pain, please wash away the pain.
So I could feel whole once again. Like an early morning sunrise in the middle of the night. The waves silencing my thoughts as I try to win this fight. I donât know where I am going or if I plan on coming back. The sea could take me under and paint my whole world black.
Paint my world black. Like an ocean tide come and dwell inside and wash away the pain. Wash away. Please wash away the pain, please wash away the pain. So I could feel whole once again.
