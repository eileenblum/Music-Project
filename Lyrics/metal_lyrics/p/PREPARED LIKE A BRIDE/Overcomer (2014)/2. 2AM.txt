I just want the sun to rise again,because Iâm sick, so sick of the night. I just want the sun to rise again,because Iâm sick, so sick of the night. I canât sleep tonight, I want to escape. The prison inside my mind, confining me. Time takes forever when you've got, all the
time in the world. Nothing seems forever, when the people you love are not given the time to treasure. The time to treasure. I canât sleep tonight, I want to escape. The prison inside my mind, confining me. It leaves me lonely as ever to think of the life we have to lead.
Without them here with us. Without them here. Time takes forever.
