Infinite time and space could not exist on, such a premise as this. You cannot count backward into infinity. Let me tell you about divinity and how such a being created you and me. When there was nothing, lying dormant were our souls awaiting a Savior. To revive the
spirit inside us. We were nothing. Frail beings falling hopelessly into the abyss. Falling hopelessly into darkness. WE WERE NOTHING. No purpose, no meaning and far from anything perfect. Everything weâd come to believe, stolen from history. A past that retraces our
steps, our every move, our every breath. Every sin that we soaked in left us separated kin. Yet He had mercy upon us. Devoid of any memory that shames us, He presents himself as a friend. One that would never frame us, yet we frame him. We were purchased at a price. One
that took his life. This time hung up on that cross we know so well. He asks that we would be forgiven, something I could never ask for and yet it is given. I do not deserve what I receive and it haunts me in my sleep. Will I ever understand the grace afforded me? I look
up at the stars and I see the glory of God beaming down upon me and I know. I was meant to be. Count the stars with me.
I KNOW WHAT ITâS LIKE TO BE FREE!
