I donât want to open my eyes, to the reality that faces me. Or the world that confronts me but I will. I will arise fearless and front the challenges ahead of me. To strive for perfection is where I long and only in your presence do I belong. Take my hand and lead me
through these darkened streets away from the paths I once tread. Take me away and rebuild my broken soul, every piece of me that shattered so long ago. Here we go again. Another journey I embark upon. This time I will bring every thought into captivity. Guard your minds.
We need to be stronger, not just believe what we see. Guard your hearts with integrity. This world wonât get the better of you and me. Iâve found the answers to lifeâs mysteries. Itâs been a long road but we will continue to strive forward, towards our goal, our final
destination our home. For a long time I fueled a war within my mind that never slept. Day after day only repeating. Constantly defeating me. Look inside to see the void needing to be filled. Until that darkness fled at the sign of the light. That found itâs way into my
life. It took me back to the start and I knew why I was a live. Open eyed to see a new world. One full of hope, one full of light. We have been called for a such a time as this. Now is our chance, let us rise together. To see the victory. Fight the dark with the light
inside us. Through Christ we hold the key. THERE IS NO EVIL THAT CAN STAND AGAINST US!
