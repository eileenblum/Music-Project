Sometimes I'd wished I were blind. For the things I've seen you'd think were make believe. Have you had those thoughts creep in your mind? There's no room to move in this polluted mind of mine. When darkness clouds my eyes, help me to see what you see. Because right now
in this life, I'm being force fed lies.
Right in front of me and all I see, and all I see, and all I see is VANITY. I know that good itself does not dwell in me, we are the sum of our thoughts. So how do you add up? SO HOW DO YOU ADD UP? You know you're living a lie, that's bound to your heart. You will sink
to the floor of the blackest oceans. Eternal darkness. Think twice before you cast your eyes, upon the throne of the earth. It will bury you. It's time to die to ourselves. In order to live for another. I'm internally bleeding. You can't see it but it's true. The life
inside me has been renewed.
