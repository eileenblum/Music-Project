Iâve broken bones and Iâve been the first to throw stones. Iâve been bashed and broken, Iâve had my heart stolen. And Iâve been torn down and Iâve been washed up. Iâve felt pain like you wouldnât believe. Scars wonât let memories fade. Amidst a jungle of thoughts,
memories that wonât be erased. My mind yearns for a better day. My stomach turns for you to know the way. For so long I wanted to do this on my own. I thought I, could walk this journey on my own. But I learnt never to walk this on your own. This world will get the
better of you if you continue on down this road. I donât know your master plan, all I know is you are the great I Am. You know where my faith stands, you know where my faith. Surely inside this chest lies love in the form of a heart. Surely inside this chest lies love.
Deep down inside my very being lies my destiny. You hold the key. Unlock me and see Iâm living for eternity, itâs just over the horizon around the bend. FOR NOTHING WILL LAST IN THE END!
