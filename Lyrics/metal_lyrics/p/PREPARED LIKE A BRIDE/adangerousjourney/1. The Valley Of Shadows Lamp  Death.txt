What a sad day this is, I have come to realize my own demise. For once I walked on that narrow path, leading towards the light. But now my time has come and on the other side I know what is right. He lived and died an innocent score but in my life I had it all. For when
those 3 days past, He rose again I turned my back. Yet to comprehend. All the pain that He suffered, not a single hate only love was shown that day. I wish things were different so on my knees I prayed. Lord have mercy on me, for you Iâve betrayed. And at that moment, I
felt a beat in my heart He said stand up my son. I want a brand new start / âI give you a new start.â What a sad day this is, I have come to realize my own demise. Leading towards the light, I now know what is wrong and what is right. So I find myself standing before you
today. Because salvation was shone my way. Iâve been born again and so I cry out to you my friend. Trust me now I know the way. The day is still early. Itâs not too late. DONâT LOOK BACK MY FRIEND! I BEG YOU! DONâT LOOK BACK!
