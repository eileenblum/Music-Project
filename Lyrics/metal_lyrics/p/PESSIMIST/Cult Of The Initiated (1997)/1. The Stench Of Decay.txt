What's this shit that...I see before me?
What the Hell has...My world become?
When the Hell did...we lose control?
Victimized by...Our elected! Sodomized by...Those we trusted!
Politicians...Fake religions!
This great nation once meant freedom, now it's run by thieves.
Politicians and police are always on the take.
No escape from their corruption, nowhere we can hide.
This great nation once meant freedom, now it's run by thieves.
No escape from their corruption, nowhere we can hide.
Missing children, drug addiction, husbands killing wives.
T.V. cameras race to film carnage in the streets.
Lying in my grave...Looking to the sky...
Searching for the light...Lying in my grave...
Looking for the light...Searching through the sky.
Our destiny is...Annihilation! Can we avoid...complete destruction!
Annihilation...Complete destruction!
Missing children, drug addiction, husbands killing wives.
T.V. cameras race to film carnage in the streets.
Even sex a cause of death, the human race is doomed!
Yet you fear these words i write and hide your kids from me.
