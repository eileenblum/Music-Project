Burn! Painstaking in the preparation,
Distorted metal image of the night to come.
Concentration tested by the feeling...
Of sexual excitement that i can't contain.
Feel the tension mount with my arousal.
Victims undetermined as the hunt begins.
Flames...Dance of death move...so sexually.
Flesh...caressed by flames screams...and I release.
When you scream in agony...I hear cries of ecstacy!!!
A frenzied scene. A voyeur's dream, a chance for me...to be complete.
Peering to see through the destruction,
The body bags that now contain your charred remains.
When i see the blackened bones and carnage, I sink into the crowd and I ejaculate.
Painstaking in the preparation,
Distorted metal image of the night to come.
