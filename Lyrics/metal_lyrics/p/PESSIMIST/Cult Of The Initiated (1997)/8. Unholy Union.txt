I'll kill her before you can kill her!!!
I exist to cause her pain. Sadistic hate is my domain.
Slice her flesh, she bleeds in vain. Her time has come, now death remains. 
Formed of her denial...Self Preservation.
Grown within her mind...to keep me sane.
Now I fear her wrath...despise her weakness.
I cannot survive...The strength of hate.
I exist to cause her pain. Sadistic hate is my domain.
Slice her flesh, she bleeds in vain!
Her time has come, now death remains. Live in fear of her...I'll reclaim you.
Immolated...Reabsorption. Mutilated...The strength of hate
Formed of her denial...Self Preservation.
Grown within her mind...to keep me sane.
Time for me to die...and I can't hide.
We must forever live in darkness...
We must forever live in darkness...
We must forever live in darkness...
