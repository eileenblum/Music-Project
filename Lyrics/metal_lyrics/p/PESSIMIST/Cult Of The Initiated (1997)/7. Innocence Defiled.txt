Since the day you thought you earned the right to tear apart my soul,
I have tried to reconstruct the pieces that you left behind.
Predator, unbound by law, natural selection rules.
You prey upon the weak and young.
I've felt the chill of hate. I know the fear of pain.
The memory of your touch is driving me insane.
Your footsteps in the hall are nightmares to a child,
Making me recall my innocence defiled.
Deviant you work your plan, calling your abuse a game.
Were you filled with evil pride to hear the bloody angel cry?
Do you feel more like a man to stand above a broken child and see the life that you destroyed?
You close the door and hit the lights.
Dissapear into the night, leaving me to cry alone...
Waiting for the night to end.
To ease my pain, I dream of your death. tears are welling in my eyes,
As the stairs begin to creak
I've felt the chill of hate. I know the fear of pain.
The memory of your touch is driving me insane.
Your footsteps in the hall are nightmares to a child...
Making me recall, my innocence defiled.
Innocence...Defiled...Innocence...
