I saw one of the seven angels with the seven vials
And he spoke saying
"I pass unto you judgement of the great whore for all the abominations of this world."
Drunk with the blood...Drunk with the blood
Drunk with the blood...Of the saints!
Then i saw a woman drunk  with the blood of the saints, 
and the martyrs, and drunk with the blood of Jesus Christ
And when I saw her I wondered in great admiration.
Drunk with the blood...Drunk with the blood
Drunk with the blood...Of the saints!!!
[Spoken]
We beheld the grea ten-horned beast, and he made us hate this great whore.
And we made her desolate, and we made her naked
And we ate her flesh..and we burned her...With fire!!!
Then I saw a woman drunk with the blood of the saints,
and the martyrs and drunk with the blood of Jesus Christ.
And when i saw her, I wondered in great admiration.
Drunk with the blood...Drunk with the blood...Drunk with the blood...
Of the saints! Drunk with the blood of the saints!!!!!
