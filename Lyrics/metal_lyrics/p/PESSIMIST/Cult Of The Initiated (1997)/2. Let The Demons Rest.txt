Tortured innocent mind existence born of pain
I fight to free myself I curse the demon's name
Twisted vision of the truth, the world tainted grey.
Listen to demonic cries...Chanting their sepultural lines.
Memories...Aborted...Mutated...Reinjected
Tortured innocent mind existence born of pain
I fight to free myself I curse the demon's name
Blackened memories of a time I wish had never been
Surrounded and protected by the demon's leather wings.
Tortured...Tormented...Surrounded...By demons.
Let the demons...Rest!!! Tortured innocent mind existence born of pain
I fight to free myself
I curse the demon's name straddle the abysmaledge
Demons taunting me to fly on shredded wings of sanity
I throw myself into the void let the demons [x4]...Rest!!!
Violent...Volatile...Cathartic...Release.
I cower on my knees and pray for death!!!!!
