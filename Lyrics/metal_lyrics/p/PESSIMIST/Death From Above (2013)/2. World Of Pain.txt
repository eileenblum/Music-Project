Within my endless longing for peace
I am spreading torment and pain
Bound to my drive I cannot cease
Filthy lust holds me in its chain

In the palace of sin
Deathâs torture is sweet
Hate sheds your skin
And love lets you bleed

Welcome to my world of pain
Welcome to my world of insanes

Take my hand, follow me
Into this little world of my own
If youâre afraid and forgot how to feel
This is the place where it will be shown

And if loneliness restrains your soul
And you donât know which way to take
Then donât hesitate, it makes you whole
This is my world, known as the den of vice

Welcome to my world of pain
Welcome to my world of insanes
