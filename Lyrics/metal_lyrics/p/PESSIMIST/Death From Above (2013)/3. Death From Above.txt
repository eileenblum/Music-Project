While they fight we pretend to live in peace
We don't see how they fall on their knees
We don't hear the shots that blast their skulls
We don't know all's lost 'til the bomb falls

Death from above â it fell from clear blue skies
Death from above â no time to close your eyes

Now we hear the thunder in the sky
Now we see the bombers passing by
Now we know the war has found us too
Now we run but our feet feel like in glue

Death from above â it fell from clear blue skies
Death from above â no time to close your eyes
Death from above â nowhere to run and hide
Death from above â 'til all you lived for died

Greedy flames begin to lick our skin
We can feel the burning deep within
The fear of dying is stronger than all
But we can't escape â 'cause now the bombs fall

Death from above â it fell from clear blue skies
Death from above â no time to close your eyes
Death from above â nowhere to run and hide
Death from above â 'til all you lived for died

Bursting noise, inferno's all around
People scream but you don't hear the sound
All explodes, time stops and all live ends
Now it's so calm â just the whisper of the flames

Death from above â it fell from clear blue skies
Death from above â no time to close your eyes
Death from above â nowhere to run and hide
Death from above â 'til all you lived for died
