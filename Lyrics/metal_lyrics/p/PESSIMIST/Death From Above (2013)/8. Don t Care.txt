For you it's not the problem
You don't see everything's rotten
Terror, death and fear
But nobody's giving a fuck to hear

Feel it
See it
Hear it
You don't care

War and crime against humanity
You mess up with your stupidity
But you live in your dream world
Don't forget about the real worldÂ 

Feel it
See it
Hear it
You don't care

Destruction and murder against mother earth
There's no will to stop this and serve
The horizon is painted in blood
Hell is here, no place for God

Feel it
See it
Hear it
You don't care

But for you it doesn't matter
The world keeps getting better
It will exist without you
Die so that there's place for something new

Feel it
See it
Hear it
You don't care
