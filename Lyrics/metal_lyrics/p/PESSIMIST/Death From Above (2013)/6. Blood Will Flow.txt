Happiness - it seems you don't find the way
To my soul - and if - how could I make you stay ?
Your place - I've taken now and again
By pain - try to fight it - I'm too weak and then

Steel! - It drills fierce in flesh
Blood! - It rins down your hand
Pain! - It will raise your chest
Death! - Just a stone cold breath

The way - the only way I see out of this
Downward spiral - is escape and I won't miss
This life - that brought me just sorrow and pain
This pain is stronger than everything and then

Steel! - It drills fierce in flesh
Blood! - It rins down your hand
Pain! - It will raise your chest
Death! - Just a stone cold breath
