You're sitting at the station
Behind your fucking friends
No jobs, no money
And show respect to me

Antisocial Bastards
You really speak to me?
This day, the last day
Anything is fine for me

Antisocial Bastards

Your parents left, they let you alone
No one else wants you anymore
Buried in hate, from society missed
Please don't come back, die in your shit
Fuck off and die

Your history lost
I piss on your brain
Never beloved
Ugly face and
An face an ass
Please don't come back
Please die in pain
I piss on your brain

Antisocial Bastards
