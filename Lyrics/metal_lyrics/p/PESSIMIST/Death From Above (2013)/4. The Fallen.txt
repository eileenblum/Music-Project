We were sent from our home
To finish all this war
We were left by our land
To fight and die alone

End my life for history
Hasn't any sense to me
We have to kill the enemy
Why can't they leave me be ?

There is nothing left
Nothing is right
We are nothing more
Than a suicide commando

We will fall
We should fight
We will die
We won't rise

Overtaken by our foes
We surely had no chance
And as the death toll grows
I had a fading glance

We saw each other fall
And even couldn't crawl
I heard my country cry
But we were meant to die

Nothing has been left
This death wasn't right
We were nothing more
Than a suicide commando

We will fall
We should fight
We will die
We won't rise
