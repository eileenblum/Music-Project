Within the whirling swarms of arrows
Out way out nasty narrows
Like a cloud of giant insects
No Greek fire that protects us

The dashing droning thundercloud
Sent by the overwhelming crowd
Breaks down over the battlement
The wall still hold the besiegment

The last bastion

For thousand years these walls stood strong
We thought forever we were wrong
Within these walls we are invincible
But now we see they are destructible

Three days long they're plundering
Killing, raping, murdering
A plague of locusts, a green flood
Turning the gold of the sea into blood

The last bastion

The last bastion

The year 1453
The shores of the golden sea
The empire of Christianity
No longer lasts its sanctity

The year 1453
The shores of the golden sea
The empire of Christianity
Brought down to its knees

For thousand years these walls stood strong
We thought forever we were wrong
Within these walls we are invincible
But now we see they are destructible

Three days long they're plundering
Killing, raping, murdering
A plague of locusts, a green flood
Turning the gold of the sea into blood

The year 1453
The shores of the golden sea
The empire of Christianity
No longer lasts its sanctity

The year 1453
The shores of the golden sea
The empire of Christianity
Brought down to its knees
