Voices within... haunting viciously cowering
Behind... a mask of sanity
Lucidity recedes... decompensating
Unwillingly... enter this domain
In the netherworld between delusions and
Reality unusual digressive functioning...
Bizarre perceptual inconsistency
Psychotically detached, cognitively unaware
Catatonic stare, life like lifelessness

Cannibalized... neuronal assault dendritic
Span... presynaptic cleft psychoactive
Charge... dopamine release transitory
Gate... chemical uptake
Fear... despair... rage... denial visions... voices...
Lies... hell scream... curse... summon... pray cries...
Pain... horror... disgust

Diathesis... predisposition genetically
Prescribed... cerebral deficit
Destroyed ability... to formulate intent unable
To perceive... a consequence to act
