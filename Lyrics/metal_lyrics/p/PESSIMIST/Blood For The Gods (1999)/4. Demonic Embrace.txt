Manipulated by unconscious rage... my demons!
Hate is the whole of my existence
Repulsed by the weakness I see
Driven to violence by the force of... the demons lurking within me
Walls around my defenses... are distorting all I perceive
A slave to my psychic demons, I bend to their blackened desires
I feel so defenseless
Unable to stop my descent, deeper into the darkness of damaged emotional schemes
Blinded by the colluded enmeshment of darkness and light
I long for the chill of the darkness and damn the existence of light

Stagnant in this existence, I am an agent of hell
Unaware of my need to wallow in degradation
Blinded by the colluded enmeshment of darkness and light
I long for the chill of the darkness and damn the existence of light

Lost in a haze of denial... exacting revenge on the world
Self-inflected aggression... meant to destroy what I feel
Claw in vain for the fragments... of my blessed ignorance
Frightened by the awareness of my reality

Manipulative!
... Exploitive!

I feel so defenseless to rage against my demons
Empower by the desire to free my eternal soul
Thriving on the death of sadistic domination
I crushed your reign with unmatched brutality
Piss on you motherfucker!
Begging at my feet
Fuck you, you're nothing
I've finally broken free
