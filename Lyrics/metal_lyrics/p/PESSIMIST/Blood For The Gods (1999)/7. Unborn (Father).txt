Father... why hast thou forsaken me?
Father... how can you turn your back on... me?
Darkness all around me, universe my own
Newly formed existence, yet I am alive
Navigate alone this amniotic sea
Your genetic pool, enacts the plan for me

Embryonic version, picture of yourself
Expression of your lust, so happy you must be
Why is there no laughter, all I hear are tears
Tears that mean so much to me when I'm the one who dies

Damn you for your cowardice,
Your weakness and your fear
It wasn't me who chose to live,
You both brought me here
