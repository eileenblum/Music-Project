You raised my generation to hate
Force fed me violence rape and deceit
Human abomination of will
Unchecked by super egotistic restraint of the mind

Hatred, vicious destruction of life,
Hardened by anger clouded by lust
Lash out to make you pay for my pain

Internal turmoil, my life and your death
Lucid decision, with moral consent
Callous expression of a frustrated soul
With lack of empathetic concern for victims
I have violated and lives I've destroyed

Hatred, vicious destruction of life,
Hardened by anger clouded by lust
Lash out, you'll fucking pay for my pain

Crushing sacred things you revere
Butchered by the new breed of the media programmed zombie spore
Bloodletting mystic mayhem of the obedient automation... obedient automation
Your fate is truly in the bloody hands of the beast!
