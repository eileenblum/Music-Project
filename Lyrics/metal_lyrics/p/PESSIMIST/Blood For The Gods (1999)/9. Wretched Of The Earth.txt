I beheld again the great whore that sitteth upon the earth
And mortal kings did commit fornication with this whore
And as I watched the wretched of the earth were made drunk
With the wine of her fornication

And I was possessed of the spirit
And in visions I saw the whore upon a scarlet colored beast
And she proclaimed her sins unto heaven
And the name she wore upon her head was the name of blasphemy

And the whore was arrayed in scarlet and gold
And she carried in her hand a jeweled chalice
And in this chalice she collected
The abominations and filthiness of her sins
And as I watched the wretched of the earth were made drunk
With the wine of her fornications

And so this whore did glorify her iniquities
And therefore shall her plagues come in a single day
And she brought upon herself famine and mourning and death
And the merchants of her wickedness shall lament
In the smoke of her burning
