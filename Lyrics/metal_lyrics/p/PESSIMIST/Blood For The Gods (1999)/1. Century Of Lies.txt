Humiliate yourself, on your knees again
Purify the essence of the deity... experience
The rush of divinity... chemical spirituality...
Removes the existential pain of mortality

My god, my god!!!
Bestow upon me the blessed Eucharist
My arms extend!!!
Waiting for the pain of holy penetration

On your knees again... offering your flesh
Theology of personal destruction
Respect upon the alter of denial
You serve the god of hypocrisy
The lord of all earthly desires

Stigmata my blood!!!
Flowing from the self inflicted wounds of penitence
Praying at the feet of the boy god that I serve!!!
Praying at the feet of the boy god

Burn your God!
Piously inject your sins!
Religion of decadence

On your knees again... offering yourself
Slowly erode into subservience
Manipulated by the ultimate deceiver
Justify the acts of depravity
Committed in the name of God

Stigmata my blood!!!
Flowing from the self inflicted wounds of penitence
Praying at the feet of the boy god that I serve!!!
Praying at the feet of the boy god
