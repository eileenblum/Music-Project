I was born in blasphemy
Was born in hell
Was born in cruelty
Was born in bloody spell

The resurrection of Satan
Cannot be done
Instead of that he sent me
His son

I bring you nightmare
Bring you the pain
Don't you dare
Drive me insane

The resurrection of Satan
Cannot be done
Instead of that he sent me
His son

Apocalypse now
Feel my bloody sword
To deify my show
That's the thought

Son of Satan
Son of Satan
