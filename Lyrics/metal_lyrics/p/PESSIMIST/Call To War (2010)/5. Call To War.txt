War is coming
In the name of the cross
The priests are calling
In the name of god

Thousands of knights
On their way to middle east
Are marching on
To fight the beast

Call
Call to war
Die
Die in war
Kill
Kill at war
War
Call to war

Call to war
Call to war

War is coming
From across the sea
Saladin is calling
To fight the crossed disease

Soldiers get around
Are ready to kill
Holy war in the middle east
To fight the beast

Call
Call to war
Die
Die in war
Kill
Kill at war
War
Call to war

Call to war
Call to war

Jerusalem is burning
The world still keeps turning
Death conquers all
But Damascus will not fall

Call
Call to war
Die
Die in war
Kill
Kill at war
War
Call to war

Call to war
Call to war
