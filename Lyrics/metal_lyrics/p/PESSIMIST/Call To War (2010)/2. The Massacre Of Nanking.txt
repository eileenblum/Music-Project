In the east over 70 years
Drew wicked winter storm
That the city in a distant land
Will never be known
Her name is strange to us
Nobody takes notice
It is not interesting
This operation of corpses

The massacre of Nanking

Evil, death, war, hate, blood, fire, burn
Rape, corpse, grave, slay, doom, die

The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast
The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast

Included from the outside world
Nobody hears your wretched pleas
Women twenty thousand in number
Suffered a disgraceful torment
Civilians two hundred thousand in number
Suffered a terrible death
There's no world for hope
Desecration of corpses

The massacre of Nanking

Evil, death, war, hate, blood, fire, burn
Rape, corpse, grave, slay, doom, die

The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast
The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast

Evil, death, war, hate, blood, fire, burn
Rape, corpse, grave, slay, doom, die

The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast
The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast
The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast
The massacre has begun
The red rising sun
The massacre in the east
The red rising beast

Red rising beast
