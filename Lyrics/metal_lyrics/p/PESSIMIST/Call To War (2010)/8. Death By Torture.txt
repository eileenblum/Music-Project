I disposed of my sins
On my doings and torments
Don't know what I want
Where the deep water flows

The surface crumbles in pieces
The light shines as dark
The expiation seems to promise
Seems to be the hope

Look in my eyes
Look in my soul
Death by torture
Look in my eyes
Look in my soul
Death by torture

Loneliness promitigation
Long forgotten
The helix of inception
The life is a test and brutal

How can we honest
When the pain is so deep
My meaningless heart bleeds
Bleeds dying in a way

Look in my eyes
Look in my soul
Death by torture
Look in my eyes
Look in my soul
Death by torture

Death by
Death by torture
Death by
Death by torture

Look in my eyes
Look in my soul
Death by torture
Look in my eyes
Look in my soul
Death by torture
Death by torture
Death by torture
