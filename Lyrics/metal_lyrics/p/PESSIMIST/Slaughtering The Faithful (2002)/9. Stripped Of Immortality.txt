[Lyrics: McLauchlin, Runyan]

MUTILATION, SACRED OATH
SACRILEGION, SANCTIFIED
MUTILATED, SUFFOCATED, BURNED ALIVE, VICIOUS DEATH
DISREGARD SUMMONING THE DEITY
TRAUMATIZED, VIOLATED, RIPPING FLESH, AFTER LIFE
BANISHED......

CURSE YOUR LORD
CURSE YOUR SINS
ETERNAL DESOLATION IS YOUR FATE
FEEL THE COLD ANGUISH OF YOUR MORTALITY--CRUSH YOUR SOUL....

MUTILATED, SUFFOCATED, BURNED ALIVE, VICIOUS DEATH
DISREGARD SUMMONING THE DEITY
TRAUMATIZED, VIOLATED, RIPPING FLESH, AFTER LIFE
BANISHED......

CURSE YOUR LORD
CURSE YOUR SINS
ETERNAL DESOLATION IS YOUR FATE
FEEL THE COLD ANGUISH OF YOUR MORTALITY--CRUSH YOUR SOUL....

DEPRIVED! DETHRONED!!!

NOW TO BREATHE
WITH MORTAL BREATH
FEEL THE PAIN OF LIVING HELL
EMPTY SHADOW
WORTHLESS STATUE
BROKEN FRAGMENT; HOLLOW SHELL

YOU'RE CONDEMNED FOR ALL ETERNITY
YOU ARE STRIPPED OF IMMORTALITY

[Solos: Hayden, McLauchlin]

MUTILATION, SACRED OATH
SACRILEGION, SANCTIFIED
MUTILATED, SUFFOCATED, BURNED ALIVE, VICIOUS DEATH
DISREGARD SUMMONING THE DEITY
TRAUMATIZED, VIOLATED, RIPPING FLESH, AFTER LIFE
BANISHED......

CURSE YOUR LORD
CURSE YOUR SINS
ETERNAL DESOLATION IS YOUR FATE
FEEL THE COLD ANGUISH OF YOUR MORTALITY--CRUSH YOUR SOUL....
