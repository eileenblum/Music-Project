[Lyrics: Runyan]

ENTER INTO THE MIND
OF THE IMPURE HUMAN
PERCEIVE WORTHLESS DISGUST
THE FORM OF REGRESSION
DEFINED WITHIN A RACE OF BEINGS

[Solos: McLauchlin, Hayden]

HUMAN BEINGS
HUMAN FILTH
HUMANS WASTE

[Solos: McLauchlin, Hayden]

CLEANSE THIS WORLD OF THIS!

THOSE WITHOUT
PURITY, INTEGRITY
DWELL UPON
LOWEST LEVELS OF THE PATH
OF THE LEAST
RESISTANCE MOLDED LIKE A LIQUID
TO THE FORM
NOW DEFINED
BY THE SURROUNDINGS

ENTER INTO THE MIND
OF THE IMPURE HUMAN
PERCEIVE WORTHLESS DISGUST
THE FORM OF REGRESSION
DEFINED WITHIN A RACE OF BEINGS

HUMAN BEINGS
HUMAN FILTH
HUMANS WASTE

EMBODIMENT OF IMPURITY
CLEANSE THE WORLD OF THIS!!!

THOSE WITHOUT
PURITY, INTEGRITY
DWELL UPON
LOWEST LEVELS OF THE PATH
OF THE LEAST
RESISTANCE MOLDED LIKE A LIQUID
TO THE FORM
NOW DEFINED
BY THE SURROUNDINGS
