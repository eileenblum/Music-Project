[Lyrics: McLauchlin, Runyan]

FEEL THE PAIN UNLEASHED
CRUSH THE WEAK AND WATCH THEM BLEED

CRAWLING ON YOUR KNEES, AS YOU DIE
FALLING TO THE PIT, WHERE YOU DWELL
CRAWLING ON YOUR KNEES, AS YOU DIE
FALLING TO THE PIT, WHERE YOU DWELL

TORMENT
UNLEASHED UPON YOU
THE THINGS YOU DESECRATE
FORGIVEN FOR YOUR HATE
TORMENT
BESTOWED UPON YOU
THE THINGS YOU DESECRATE
RESURRECTED FOR....

CRAWLING ON YOUR KNEES, AS YOU DIE
FALLING TO THE PIT, WHERE YOU DWELL
CRAWLING ON YOUR KNEES, AS YOU DIE
FALLING TO THE PIT, WHERE YOU DWELL

TORMENT
UNLEASHED UPON YOU
THE THINGS YOU DESECRATE
FORGIVEN FOR YOUR HATE
TORMENT
BESTOWED UPON YOU
THE THINGS YOU DESECRATE
RESURRECTED FOR....

[Solos: McLauchlin, Hayden]

MALEVOLENCE
FOREVER; UNRELENTING,
RISE AGAIN TO CONQUER
DAMNATION
HIDEOUS, REPULSIVE DIVINITY
MAJESTIC, BLACKENED FROM THE STENCH OF DEATH

[Solos: Hayden, McLauchlin]

FEEL THE PAIN UNLEASHED
CRUSH THE WEAK AND WATCH THEM BLEED

CRAWLING ON YOUR KNEES, AS YOU DIE
FALLING TO THE PIT, WHERE YOU DWELL
CRAWLING ON YOUR KNEES, AS YOU DIE
FALLING TO THE PIT, WHERE YOU DWELL

TORMENT
UNLEASHED UPON YOU
THE THINGS YOU DESECRATE
FORGIVEN FOR YOUR HATE
TORMENT
BESTOWED UPON YOU
THE THINGS YOU DESECRATE
RESURRECTED FOR....YOU
