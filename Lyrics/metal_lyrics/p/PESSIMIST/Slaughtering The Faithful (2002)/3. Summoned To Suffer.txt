[Lyrics: McLauchlin, Runyan]

SUMMONED FORTH FROM THE DEPTHS
PAIN IS MY FUEL
CALLED UPON FROM THE BLACK ABYSS
GRIND THEIR BONES INTO DUST
LEAVE YOUR NETHERWORDLY REGIONS
HATE IS MY FUEL
UNVEIL THE EVIL PROPHECY
HATE; THEY WILL KNOW SO WELL

TORMENT THEM--SUFFER IN PAIN
TORTURE THEM--AGAIN AND AGAIN

SUFFER ENDLESS
NO ESCAPE FROM THE PAIN
ERASE YOUR PRESENCE
NOTHING OF YOU REMAINS
KNOWING TORMENT
CRUSH THE SEEDS THAT YOU BREED
SUFFER ENDLESS
YOU, I CONQUER, FEEL THE PAIN!

SUFFER...

[Solos: McLauchlin, Hayden, McLauchlin, Hayden, McLauchlin]

SUMMONED FORTH FROM THE DEPTHS
PAIN IS MY FUEL
CALLED UPON FROM THE BLACK ABYSS
GRIND THEIR BONES INTO DUST
LEAVE YOUR NETHERWORDLY REGIONS
HATE IS MY FUEL
UNVEIL THE EVIL PROPHECY
HATE; THEY WILL KNOW SO WELL

TORMENT THEM--SUFFER IN PAIN
TORTURE THEM--AGAIN AND AGAIN
