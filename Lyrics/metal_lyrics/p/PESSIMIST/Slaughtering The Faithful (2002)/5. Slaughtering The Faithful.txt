[Lyrics: Runyan]

THE TIME HAS COME
TO CLEANSE THE FILTH
THE TIME HAS COME
WITH HATRED
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR THEM TO DIE
THE TIME HAS COME
DARK VENGEANCE

Solo: McLauchlin

SPILLING THE BLOOD TO THE GROUND
DRIVEN TO TAKE THEIR LIFE WITH HATE
SPILL THE BLOOD DOWN TO THE GROUND

REVERSING THE ORDER
OF REPULSIVE DETESTMENT
TRIUMPH THROUGH DARKNESS
NEFARIOUS CONQUEST

DEFY THE FALSE SANCTIMONY
ANNIHILATION SHATTER THESE
THINGS COMPRISED OF DECEIT

[Solo: Hayden]

(ARDENT PROPONENT OF HOLOCAUSTIC REDEMPTION)

REVERSING THE ORDER
OF REPULSIVE DETESTMENT
TRIUMPH THROUGH DARKNESS
NEFARIOUS CONQUEST

DEFY THE FALSE SANCTIMONY
ANNIHILATION SHATTER THESE
THINGS COMPRISED OF DECEIT

[Solos: McLauchlin, McLauchlin, Hayden]

THE TIME HAS COME
TO CLEANSE THE FILTH
THE TIME HAS COME
WITH HATRED
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR THEM TO DIE
THE TIME HAS COME
DARK VENGEANCE

WARFARE
PURIFY THE BEINGS UNCLEANSED
HATRED
FLOWING IN ME FOR THE IMPURE....
VIOLENT
DEEDS OF CONQUEST
DEMOLITION
THE BLOOD SATURATES THE GROUND BENEATH THEM

REVERSING THE ORDER
OF REPULSIVE DETESTMENT
TRIUMPH THROUGH DARKNESS
NEFARIOUS CONQUEST

DEFY THE FALSE SANCTIMONY
ANNIHILATION SHATTER THESE
THINGS COMPRISED OF DECEIT
