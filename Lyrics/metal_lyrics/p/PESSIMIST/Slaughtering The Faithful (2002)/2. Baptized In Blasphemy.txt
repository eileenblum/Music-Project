[Lyrics: Runyan]

AWAKENING
THE EYES OF DARKNESS
IN OUR DEEDS OF DEEPEST EVIL...
CRUSADES
THAT WILL CRUSH THE HOLY ARMIES
UNDER THE KING OF DARKNESS

CONQUER THE LIGHT
DEFEAT THEIR GOD
TAKING THE THRONE
FROM GOD

HATRED OF GOD
DRIVING DEMONS
TO DRINK THE BLOOD
OF GOD

BAPTIZED IN BLASPHEMY

RISE AGAINST THE ENEMY
CRUSH THEIR FORCES IN DEFEAT
BURN THEIR SOULS IN FIRES OF HATE......

RAPING THE ANGELS
AS GOD IS ENSLAVED,
CONQUER THE LIGHT
THAT HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES,
ENLIGHTEN THE NUNS
TO LUSTFUL SINNING,
DENOUNCING THEIR FALLEN GOD
IN SHAME AND DEFEAT.....

CONQUER THE LIGHT
DEFEAT THEIR GOD
TAKING THE THRONE
FROM GOD

HATRED OF GOD
DRIVING DEMONS
TO DRINK THE BLOOD
OF GOD

BAPTIZED IN BLASPHEMY

HANDS OF GOD ARE PARALYZED
WEAK AND HELPLESS
ENSLAVED BY THE KING OF HELL,
NOW YOUR MASTER

[Solos: McLauchlin, Hayden]

HANDS OF GOD ARE PARALYZED
WEAK AND HELPLESS
ENSLAVED BY THE KING OF HELL,
NOW YOUR MASTER

[Solos: Hayden, McLauchlin]

RISE AGAINST THE ENEMY
CRUSH THEIR FORCES IN DEFEAT
BURN THEIR SOULS IN FIRES OF HATE......

AWAKENING
THE EYES OF DARKNESS
IN OUR DEEDS OF DEEPEST EVIL...
CRUSADES
THAT WILL CRUSH THE HOLY ARMIES
UNDER THE KING OF DARKNESS

CONQUER THE LIGHT
DEFEAT THEIR GOD
TAKING THE THRONE
FROM GOD

HATRED OF GOD
DRIVING DEMONS
TO DRINK THE BLOOD
OF GOD

BAPTIZED IN BLASPHEMY
