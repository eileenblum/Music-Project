[Lyrics: Runyan, Hayden]

[Solo: McLauchlin]

I LIVE AS THEY DIE
I LIVE THROUGH ALL TIME
YOUR FLESH IS MY FORM
I'VE LIVED AS THEY'VE DIED
I'VE LIVED THROUGH ALL TIME
YOUR FLESH IS MY FORM
FORMLESS AS THE AIR
AGELESS, I AM HERE
I POSSESS YOUR FLESH

TRANSMIGRATE; STEAL YOUR FLESH
TRANSMIGRATE
TRANSMIGRATE; STEAL THE FLESH
TRANSMIGRATE

RETURN TO THE FORMLESS

I LIVE AS THEY DIE
I LIVE THROUGH ALL TIME
YOUR FLESH IS MY FORM
I'VE LIVED AS THEY'VE DIED
I'VE LIVED THROUGH ALL TIME
YOUR FLESH IS MY FORM

FORMLESS AS THE AIR
AGELESS, I AM HERE
I POSSESS YOUR FLESH

[Solos: Hayden, McLauchlin]

TRANSMIGRATE; STEAL YOUR FLESH
TRANSMIGRATE
TRANSMIGRATE; STEAL THE FLESH
TRANSMIGRATE

RETURN TO THE FORMLESS

UNBOUND BY THE CHAINS
WORN BY THE MORTALS
WITHIN THE PUREST FORM OF ABSOLUTION

[Solo: Hayden]

ALL DEATH IS UNKNOWN TO ME
POSSESSION OF THE MORTAL BODIES
I WILL REIGN ETERNALLY THROUGHOUT CREATION

UNBOUND BY THE CHAINS
WORN BY THE MORTALS
