There is a moment in life when you don't know what will come
Look for the meaning of life and there's nothing you can find
You may feel down and think that there's nowhere you can go
But you will rise like the phoenix from the ashes of your past

Ladies &amp; Gentlemen welcome to the show of life!
You will see desperation, misery and pain
You will find that your life is like living in hell
You will see superstition as your only religion,
struggling with evils that won't really come
You'll find that this life won't give you peace of mind
but what will you do if you don't want to die?

Maybe now it's time to feel alive

All the life that you have left behind
will help you to face the things to come
The future meets the past in this new present
The end of the beginning has gone

The sun is shining on my back
I've got the feeling I can glow
And if things don't turn out that way
I still will sing this song
One thing that is too hard to learn
is that darkness turns to light
and if you're singing to this tune
You'll see the sun at night

You'll see that life's not a matter of good or evil
You'll see that thereâs no drawing line
between darkness and light
You'll see that love becomes hate
and that's something you can't change,
you'll have to feel the pain
You'll see a flood of fire burning
deep in your soul turning the flesh into dust
You're the owner of your life
so you have to avoid the lies
because God has died

All the life that you have left behind
will help you to face the things to come
The future meets the past in this new present
The end of the beginning has gone

The future meets the past in this new present
The end of the beginning has gone
