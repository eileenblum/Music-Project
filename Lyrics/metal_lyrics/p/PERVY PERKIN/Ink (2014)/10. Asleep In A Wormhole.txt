Wake at 8:11,
Half my face on the bed,
Got a strange sensation,
Has this happened again?
My body yet so numb,
Starts to move again,
I get up with a headache
I leave my room, turn left.

I lead my feet across the hall
Directly into the kitchen.
The TVâs on but no oneâs home,
Man, what a waste of cable!
I grab the bread I shake my head
The pain is getting stronger
My whole body trembles
I think Iâm passing out.
I think not again
And I donât know
Why this similar sensation
I donât recall ever passing out.
I'm reaching the phone,
But the toaster is on,
Get burned
And then scream like a small girl
My vision collapses,
My headache grows fast,
I really think
Iâm gonna faint here.
It happens too fast
I just fall to the ground
Without hearing at all
But Iâm hearing one sound,
And I wake up again,
8:11 am,
With my face on the bed
The sensation is there!

What is happening?
Is this the real thing?
I can feel there's something wrong
I recall
I've lived the scene
With a change of scenery
Maybe not completely odd
But I can see the spots

So I get up again,
Or that's what I intend
But look at that!
That's not my arm!
It seems the night went great,
I apparently got laid,
She was not here!
This is fucked up!

I get up, strangest feeling
But I think...I was dreaming!
The TV's off, I sit down
I turn it on and try to calm down.
There is nothing good to see
I can hear how she's calling me
So I get up, but my head grows pain
I know that, I've felt the same
I start to faint!

What is happening?
Is this the real thing?
I can feel there's something wrong
I've lived the scene
With a change of scenery
Maybe not completely odd
But I just can see the spots
I recall.

I get up once again
I reach my phone and call
No signal anywhere
This fucking piece of junk!
I'm now alone, the TVs off
But then I hear a knocking
There's someone at the door
I better go to open
My head starts to hurt
I get to cross the hall
The doorknob spins around
10 minutes on the clock
I feel like laying down
Finally the door
I fall, I try to watch it
There's nothing I can do
All is getting darker...
