[Helmsman:] The course of the man
is hiding from him
the sky is red, the darkness is here
when the shadow has come
a light has been seen
from the depths to his eyes I can see
a reflection in time
too short to be told
to the east we turned and soon we forgot
for days weeks and months
we travelled the world
only echoes in the night what we have got.

[Boatswain:] From the coldest ice
to the boiling fire
from the viking lands
to the rivers of mayan
hundred days have past
we are lost and tired
all it seems is hard to believe!

[Captain:] Wherever I go
whatever I see
only echoes and reflections
we are getting so much closer
I dont care what it takes

[Captain:] Ahead,
tack,
turn the rudder, hoist the mainsail
fast is the chase,
and long the run
the wind is with us
the gods show their trust
long may be the path,
but not the chase.

[Captain:] We're on the right way.
[Boatswain:] The men are falling, sir.
[Captain:] That's where it would be found. Impossible maze?
[Boatswain:] They need a rest; my captain.
[Captain:] I never ever lost a trace.

[Captain:] Follow the sign.
[Boatswain:] My captain please.
[Captain:] The ancient path.
[Boatswain:] No man should reach.
[Captain:] Rest is but triumph's enemy!

[Captain:] Wherever I go
whatever I see
only echoes and reflections
the light of the stars is guiding my way
it's so clear to me
it's too late now, glory awaits
in the depths of the sea.
