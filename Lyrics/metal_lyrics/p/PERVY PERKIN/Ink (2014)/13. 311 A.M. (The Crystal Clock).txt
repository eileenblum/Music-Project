[He:] I am,
in a room far from anywhere.
This bed is cold,
I'm trapped alone.

Contemplating a wide mirror
A big clock beside me.
Why is it not ticking away?
Why is it always 3:11 A.M.?
(Wake up)

I see a shape in the mirror glass,
A vision of two black frozen eyes.

So I turn, to see her face
But the shape is goneâ¦
An empty space instead
Who is out there?
I've been here for too long
Save me! Please, please...

[She:] Dear live again,
Open your eyes,
I know you're alive.
Why don't you wake?
3 years hurt too much,
Dave, come back to life

[He:] A vague illusion of the brightest past
A voice inside is calling me,
Like an angel.

[She:] I can feel your heart,
Beating strong,
To survive.

[He:] The ice is melting,
The lights fade out
Only her eyes are shining now.

[She:] Please wake up!,
Open your eyes,
Open them!

[He:] Then I saw your face,
I stared at that joyful rain.
I kissed your lonely lips,
And held you close.
Cassiopeia of mine,
Constellation in the sky
For all these moons
Youâve warmed my coldest nights

[She:] David, do you know?
I've been coming at the same hour
For too long, for you!

[He:] Stay with me,
Donât let me fall asleep.
