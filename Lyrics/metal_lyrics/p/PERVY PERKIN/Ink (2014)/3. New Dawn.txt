Dead,
for nothing
Hero of the wrong cause
What have they done?
His sacrifice, a loss
His life, mistaken.
And what is taken now
Will never come back.
Now it's time
To look up and claim what you need
For them to pay their crimes
Their greed.

And nothing will persuade us
Everything will change
Memories won't fade out
In the end you'll fail
His life will be avenged
And we shall see new dawn
The dark is not forever
He will not be gone
He will not be gone
And we shall see new dawn.
And it's time to go

These bounds
Between
You and us
Wonât last forever
You know it
We know!
