Slave of my heart
always trying to break me down
dellusional mind
Is this how i' ll always be?

You know that something is there
another false sign
I can't even see the line anymore
The darkest symbiosis, a bed of no roses, is this what is left to me?

The sound of this life
double edged sword
sorrow in my heart
magic in my tone

the sound of this life
double edged sword
magic in my tone
sorrow in my heart

I thought I was lost and drained (you were wrong)
an emptiness called insane (you were wrong)
and all of the skies are falling (you were wrong)
the happiness long forgotten (you were wrong)

And nothing is taking us apart
I need you to survive
and they're calling

I'm not gonna leave you anyway
you're the blood in my veins
and they're growing

This is who and how I always am
my music and my heart
and they're coming

I wanna live my life
maybe just not pretend
I'm losing me again

One body pouring down
two different songs alive
distorsionates the hound
they're coming)

GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!
GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!

This... heart... every time... beats drowned... in the sound.
Cold... eyes... empty look... the world as I knew it... lost.

Walk... down.. the riverside... ravens as gulls... around me.
Fall... rise... ringing in my ear... a forest, a night... and a cliff.

Blue inside and below
they're haunting me to meet
I cannot fight anymore.

This darkest core in me
source of my life and grief
finally free... one step.
