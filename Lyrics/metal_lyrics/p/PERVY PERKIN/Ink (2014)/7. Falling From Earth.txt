Lie
On the ground.
Hear that peaceful sound.
And see
What could be,
What is coming.

Light,
Blinding light,
Dream of a past life
Darkness what it brings
And I know it.
Falling From Earth:

Life,
Only time
To be wasted.
I did what I did
and I don't regret it

The end
Of the world
And nobody's here to learn.
And why
Should I cry
I knew this time would come

And what is left for me,
Just air so hot that I wouldn't breath.
My vision starts to fade,
My mind is going some other place.
