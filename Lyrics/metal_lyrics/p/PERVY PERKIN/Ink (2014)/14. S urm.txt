In a sea made of hopes, his drowned wishes sailed everywhere next to him.
A young, and naive soul was being decieved in a false reality.
He discovered his lost paradise, a place where he found many opportunities
But his joy began to vanish when he woke up from his endless dream.

[S!urm:] I can touch the sky with my handsFall asleep in the clouds at night
And the sun, is shining from my heart
When the moon escapes me from my mind
I can't imagine what's wrong with this...

This land unconsciousness
I'm afraid this glass breaks
Pieces of heaven would rain
Without this I couldn't rest

[Friend:] Rest my friend
I'll be there

[S!urm:] I'm tired of seeing
the same unclear face.

[Friend:] Face the pain
Take it out from your blame.

[S!urm:] Oh, How I'd wish to be awake

[Friend:] Wake up from your dream,
Dreaming is not what you need.
All you feel is unreal
Now it's time to break free.

Fuck! S!urm, wake up from your fucking dream!!!

[Inner voice:] There's no escape from the fog, the shock, the clock, the lock of reality
This impulse comes from deep within inside
Don't even try to deny you've always lived for it.

[Inner voice:] Remember when you started putting bricks in the wall
Now you're living in your own Andalusian Dog
This is better than the pavement and the city smog
The Mistery Train of dreams is your world
Don't forget it! Don't forget it! For reality you ain't ready!

[Inner voice:] Stop! out of this prison you're not
Don't you remember, together we built up our world
I'm the reason of your questions and thoughts
I'm the soul, the pain, the hate, the love, you will drown!

[Friend:] Now you know the truth
You only have to choose
What is better for you
Remember your wasted youth

[S!urm:] What's the sense of living here?
nobody really cares about it,
grass less green, sun bleeds cold, all colors fade to grey.
Now where is my brush to paint them?
Where's my soft, white cloud to lay down?,
I should never rebirth to that world,
Will my home be safe?

Save my land of consciousness
I'm afraid this glass breaks
Pieces of heaven would rain
Without this I couldn't rest...

[Friend:] Rest my friend
I'll be there.

[S!urm:] Fantasy
is my real place.

[Friend:] Place of pain
Take it out from your blame.

[S!urm:] Now, my decision has been made
I'll keep the dream alive!
