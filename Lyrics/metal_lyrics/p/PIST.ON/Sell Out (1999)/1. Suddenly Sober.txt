mark my words and read my stone
i've never felt so alone
there was a time for  a while
when the taste...the feel... the mood was right but.....

suddenly, i'm sober
sudeenly, i'm sober

one more night and one more goal
oh my heart wont let you go
you liked me for a while
then you lied. you stole
you robbed my car. then...

suddenly, i'm sober
suddenly, i'm sober

all my life is spent
thinking about how good you were
all my days are spent
chasing the feeling that i got
when i put myself to your throat

and i hate my life, i hate my soul
all this pain wont let me go.
you liked me for a while
then you came. you left.
don't ever go. cause

suddenly, i'm sober
one last goodbye.
