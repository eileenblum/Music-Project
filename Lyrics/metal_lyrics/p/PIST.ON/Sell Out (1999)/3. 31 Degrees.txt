thirty one degrees of cold sleep
like always feel inside
open and controlled in time
then my nose grows

searched so long

i feel cold............
i feel cold............
when i try  forget the reason why
i feel cold............

thirty one degress of pain inside
like a fallen tree, besides
cornerd and subdued inside
as my thaughts go

searched so long
i feel cold...........
i feel cold...........

what a lucky man he was to never find love............

when i lie i feel cold........
