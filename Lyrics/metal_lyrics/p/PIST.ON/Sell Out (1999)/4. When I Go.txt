forget the day you planned to kill me
unlock the change and open gently
forget the ugly photograph
i like the feel that's unreal

cause i show
and i know

when i go..... take me slow
when i go..... take me slow

forget the rope that hangs above my head
unlock the fear that overcomes me
forget the lonely border rat
i like the feel that's unreal
