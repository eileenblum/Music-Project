im happy
im scared
So lonely. so glad
dont ask me to find a subject
i cant go back
dont ask me to tap my feelings
the pains to great

i want to see
take my arms
take my legs
let me see...

i want to cry
but these tears cant be seen through these eyes

unlucky who cares???
so angry
i stare
i open my arms to something thats not there
i close my eyes so i can taste air

i want to see.......
take my arms
take my legs
let me see...........

i want to cry.. but there tears cant be seen through these eyes.......

i hate the world i.....
i hate the world i.....
i hate the world i....................
i hate the world now!!!!!!
i hate the world now!!!!!!
i hate the world i cant see..............

So lonely
so sad
i hate me, i dont care
i need to close the door now so stand there
i feel a face beside me
you cant walk out

i want to see......
take my arms
take my legs
let me see..........

i want to cry....
but these tears cant be seen through these eyes
