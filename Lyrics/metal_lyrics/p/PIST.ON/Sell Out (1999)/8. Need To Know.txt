catch the day
see some stray
im looking at myself
open eyes
no suprise
i'm only for myself.
whisper winds
southern limbs
i'm open for myself

i need to know
wont you tocuh my face again
i need to know
wont you touch my face again

long live. night seeing eyes
all is not so. amd yje stronger i get
the stronger i long for the open air i find beneath my tire

feel my brain
touch my mind
im holding on myself
