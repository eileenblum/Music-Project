running away from my
running away from myself...
and i want to hide
checking the wind for my
checking the wind for some help
when worls colide

to hell with elation on this square ill be..
you dont like my fucked up reputation

taking away from myself
i am loved yet im hated
as life go'es by
loving myself like a fool is comfortably jaded!!!!
so why the smile?.....

there's nothing wrong with me
i try.... i try.... nothing wrong with me
i say to myself something's wrong with me

YOU DONT LIKE MY FUCKED UP!!!! CONVERSATION!!!!
TO HELL!!! WITH ELATION...
ON THIS SQUARE ILL BE...........

YOU DONT LIKE MY FUCKED UP REPUTATION!! ITS CONSTILATION...
ON THIS SQUARE ILL BE.
