dont wipe that smile off your face
dont change that look cause you'll pay
open heart open deep
i am the ine i am for keeps
just the way i am
the cold dark stare and the fault lines
just another way to prove to you
that i dont care..... i dont care.......

now that im someone
the world takes me under
i need more life so i take
now that im someone
alone and disgruntled
i need more life so i take

dont chnage your eyes or your hair....
dont dont hold me back you wont dare
open your mind open dreams
i am the cold i am unleashed
Just the way i am
the cold dark stare and the fault lines
just another way to prove to you that i dont care
i really dont care

now that im someone the world takes me under
i need more life so i take
now that im someone alone and disgrunted
i need more life so i take
i take..........................
