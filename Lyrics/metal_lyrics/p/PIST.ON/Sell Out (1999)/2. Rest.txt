I dont't understand me
i fill my world with mysterious feelings
i feel the loss of control
i think that nothing can stop
this delirious speeding
deal!!! don't look to unload
cause i know fortune's misleading

all of the rest that i get
im sleeping less and less
all of the time that i waste
im sleeping less and less

i feel like i taste
im opened up for my own demise so fear grips my lips
and i understand why you want to fly
but why!!!! must you open sores and steal a moment's true meaning
