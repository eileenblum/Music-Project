i stare at there
new car...
makes me crazy
what am i looking for?

oh let me drive myself home!!!!!

i bear all there big talk
makes me angry
im glad i bought this gun....

oh let me drive myself home!!!!!!

i dreamt i fell slowly back..
drive up on myfilthy back
careful where you stand
careful where you drive
careful where you land
inside my car

"heavens nows im isserable now"
