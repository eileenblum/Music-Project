aim changing my life im bleeding all the time
this night may be my final night
destructive but kind
contagious yet blind
looking at you i dont really see much love

my mother wasn't kind we didnt see eye to eye
its all academic now; she shit me out
twisting like time. my brain has different sides
push me wrong i'll push you off the track

eight sides
eight sides

im focusing i find. im drinfting in and out of time
a kiss from me. you can kiss your life goodbye

theres nothing wrong with my head

[chorus]
