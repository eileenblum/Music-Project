time never was as they are for me
im happiest in a world full over error
time breaks my heart chnaged my soul again this time my friend

excuse im wrong
but i need some encouraging
thank you for being so bold
so catch me when i fall
so i need your touch beside me
thank you for being so bold

and armed with your look that's my fault i see
and safe in your world. full of time full of pressure
time breaks my heart chnaged my soul again this time my friend

[Chorus]
