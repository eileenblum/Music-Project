i am no one to say
tomorrow i'll have the chid inside me
and if you want me for a friend
go change the world but dont forget your brother
and if you need me to be there
just run the chain and dont forget to choke me

i am no one. make me someone
i am no one. make me someone

as i wonder
makes me wonder
but need thy discover

tomorrow's the day when nighttime
engulfs your holy father oh yes
and sunday the day you beg for forgivness with no sorrow.

i am no one make me someone
i am no one make me someone

as i wonder makes me wonder
