on the edge on the edge
i believe im on the edge
and through a window dirty window
and need some light and air
and she came upon my window with a promise of love
just lie through the skin on yyour teeth and she's sure to let you go

i dont really want you to leave now im on parole
consumed by the love of another im on parole

i catch my breath my smokey breath
for the first time in a century
these prison walls filthy walls look better looking out than looking in
then she came upon my window with a promise of love
just lie through the skin on your teeth and she's sure to let you go
