let me out of the womb...
leave this earth with a dry wet kiss
capture my heart with your fingertips
i love you in death i hate you in life
a 2 second flashback can change my life

i'm afraid of life. i need some understanding world
i'm afraid of life. i need some strength and four more horse

strange but blid she shows up timed
angry and scared i loose my mind
i hate you in death. i love you in life
these feelings of fear they rule my life

and together we fight. together we die
give me your tongue and the earth flies bye
but together were one. together wev'e died
i am your sun and your earth

[chorus]

take me back to the womb...
