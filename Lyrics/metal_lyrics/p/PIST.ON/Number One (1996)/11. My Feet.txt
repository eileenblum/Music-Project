catch me if you can im quicker than an eye
call me crazy i'll call you mine
you are not yourself i can tell by your ears
warm and tender make me shine

im alone here, feeling strong here, but my feet are not my own

alcohol fucks with my mind
makes me crazy
makes me blind
you are not yourself i can tell by the white of your ears

you look for pressure pressurized

[chorus]

not my own
not my own
