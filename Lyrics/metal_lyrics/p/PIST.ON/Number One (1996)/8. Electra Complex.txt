its mysterious its blind faith
this way i feel for you. love me last  take my hand daddy i dress for you

do you feel the same way.
feel the same way
same way that i do

its godflesh its moments touch this scent i have for you i know im wrong the 
feel is strong
explain. no not to soon

[chorus]

worshipping the ground that you walk on and its wrong
capturing this feeling deep inside this song.
expressing all my feelings this bloodline seems so long
i'll end it with a kiss a kick a punch no more

its sysyncopation a generation 20 years to soon
a crazy wish a burning itch. now leave me alone you
