change dosent come easy for lazy and sleazy
shots from a tower the song of the hour
i have personal hatred for the selfish and jaded
how could this blade taste a part of your shadow?

down and out..
down and out..

i cant feel my temples this throbbing entangles
she begs at my ankles at feeds on my bowels
i cant take this pressure, this timeless adventure
something keeps tickling
i cant fucking think!

400miles from home
i wanna be alone
400miles from home
i wanna be alone

down and out..
down and out..
