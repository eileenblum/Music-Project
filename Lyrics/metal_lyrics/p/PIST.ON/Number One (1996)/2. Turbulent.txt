too much time thinking about disturbing you
sober nights bring upon reluctant views
changinig light from white to orange juice
fingers around my neck im turning blue

feel turbulent
feel turbulent

not yourself in a world that i once knew

i spend my life thinking about destroying you
and anxious to try not to try to be like you

feel turbulent
feel turbulent
