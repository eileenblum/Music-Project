He stepped up for his democracy
Believed he could contribute to liberty
A genious young man served his country of modern knights
Proud to defend justice, values and the human rights

He cannot be silenced
Saviours become tyrants
He cannot be silenced
Stop the war-cry of violence

Accused of malicious act of treason
His change of mindset had so many reasons
Counter-terrorism the reason why he joined the intelligence
He just wanted to have a job with much more relevance

He cannot be silenced
We cannot be silenced
Raise your voices now

He cannot be silenced
Saviours become tyrants
We cannot be silenced
Stop the war-cry of violence

His dedication became a nasty deadly threat
Trained to manipulate the secret mindset
A man with pride changed the view on our monitored system
His sacrificed his life for our freedom
Join the resistance

He cannot be silenced
We cannot be silenced
Raise your voices now

He cannot be silenced
Saviours become tyrants
We cannot be silenced
Stop the war-cry of violence

He cannot be silenced
Saviours become tyrants
We cannot be silenced
Stop the war-cry of violence

We cannot be silenced
