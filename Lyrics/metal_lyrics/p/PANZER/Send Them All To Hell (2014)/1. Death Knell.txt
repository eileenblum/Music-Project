Send them all to hell
Stagnation, damnation - the holy liar
Created an empire of fire, war &amp; lies
A nation, a creation - insane illusions
Of a man of delusions - power creates death

Break down the bridges at the black sea
Flexing muscles to ruin
Can't you see this nations decline?
Can't you see the land decline?

Beat me - squeeze me
Crush my bones to pieces but my mind will never break
Death knell
Respect our freedom or rot in fucking hell

Promoter, freeloader - warmonger
Greed is so much stronger than rationality
Dictation, frustration - distraught mind
Quest for recognition a savage scream for help?

Break down the bridges at the black sea
Flexing muscles to ruin
Can't you see this nations decline?

Beat me - squeeze me
Crush my bones to pieces but my mind will never break
Death knell
Respect our freedom or rot in fucking hell
Can't you hear the death knell? Send them all to hell!!!

Speed demon - breeding evil - holy liar - he will burn in hell!

Beat me - squeeze me
Crush my bones to pieces but my mind will never break
Death knell
Respect our freedom or rot in fucking hell
Can't you hear the death knell? Send them all to hell!!!
