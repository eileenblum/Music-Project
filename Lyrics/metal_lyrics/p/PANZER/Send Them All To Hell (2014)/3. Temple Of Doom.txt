A crazy bunch of madness - created by fate
The challenge is on - let's get shit straight
Nodding the head - you know what to do
Creating the campaign to break through

Show your teeth and climb up that ladder
Nothing else will ever matter
We need no Jesus or luxury strife

We reign the temple of doom
Ascend - the temple of doom
We want your soul - temple of doom

Warcraft of madness is taking its toll
Is our savior just playing a role?
If all hope is lost - the mob starts to gather
Prayers of the faithful - alter to cadaver

Show your teeth and climb up that ladder
Nothing else will ever matter
We need no Jesus or luxury strife

We reign the temple of doom
Ascend - the temple of doom
We want your soul - temple of doom

Exterminate the observation - rise up!

We reign the temple of doom
Ascend - the temple of doom
We want your soul - the temple of doom
Obtain - the temple of doom
Save our - soul ascending the temple of doom
Rise up - save our souls our lives
We reign - we reign the temples of doom!!!
