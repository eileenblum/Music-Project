In a lonely moment of his darkest hour
An old man reflects his lifework
His eyes seem to burst under pressure &amp; pain
He prays to the sky like he wants to explain...

Why did he chose this brutal life path?
Harvesting now the grapes of wrath?
Does the end only reflect his dirty deeds?
Racked by remorse cause of his primitive needs?

Who creates us being evil?
Born we are all smooth &amp; equal
Educated to spread hate
Living in a slave state?

Hail &amp; kill
No free will
Hail &amp; kill
Feel the...
The thrill - hail &amp; kill!!!

His sorrow now seems far too late
He was the one that enjoyed to dictate
The broken man once so super hardcore
At the end now just of a wreck of war

How ironic to see him on his knees
Praying to a god in which he never believed
The regret is now written on his face
His scared soul will leave him in disgrace

Who creates us being evil?
Born we are all smooth &amp; equal
Educated to spread hate
Living in a slave state?

Hail &amp; kill
No free will
Hail &amp; kill
Feel the...
The thrill - hail &amp; kill!!!

Who creates us being evil?
Born we are all smooth &amp; equal
Educated to spread hate
Living in a slave state?

Hail &amp; kill -
No free will
Hail &amp; kill
Feel the...
The thrill hail &amp; kill!!!
