By a river in Zaire a monster was born
A deadly serious threat beyond any norm
A silent killer sneaked into our sphere
Nothing will be the same - smell the fear

The highest case - fatality rate
Is creeping out of an unknown state

Like a panzer - like a cancer
Like a panzer...

Was bushmeat and wildkill once a provider
Hard to believe that it is now a hell rider
Roughage is engraved, serves as a belly filler
As a back up, a savior and not a bloody killer

The highest case - fatality rate
Is creeping out of an unknown state

Like a panzer - like a cancer
Like a panzer - a motherfucking
Pleague!!!
Like a panzer - deathbringing - like a cancer
Steamrolling - like a panzer - a motherfucking
Pleague!!!

Like a panzer - like a cancer
Like a panzer - a motherfucking
Pleague!!!
Like a panzer - deathbringing - like a cancer
Steamrolling - like a panzer - a motherfucking
Pleague!!!

The pharma mafia is conniving the dying - like a panzer
Watching the misery instead of supplying - like a panzer
The scourge will have no scruples, no borders - like a panzer
Death is not waiting for money orders - like a panzer

Like a panzer... Like a panzer...
