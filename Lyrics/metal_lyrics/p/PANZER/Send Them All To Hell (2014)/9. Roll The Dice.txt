You can call me a liar
Caught in mental barb wire
I made my mistakes
I crushed your trust
Just call me a loser
I admit I'm a boozer
I failed on all stages
Addiction hell...

Being alive - just like in zombieland
Crash dive - into fatality
Being alive - just like in zombieland
The end - doomed to fail

Roll the dice - choose your side and be a man
Roll the dice - wanna end up in a trash can?
Roll the dice - dice!!!

Not begging for your grace
In this bloody rat race
I flip the coin and choose
Yes I got the fuckin' blues
The gamble called existence
Game of last resistance
Every winner will lose
Game over - self - abuse

Being alive - feels like I'm in zombieland
Crash dive - into fatality
Being alive - just like in zombieland
The end - doomed to fail

Roll the dice - choose your side and be a man
Roll the dice - wanna end up in a trash can?
Roll the dice - dice!!!
When you chose your way to the abyss
Make sure your backseat is empty
If drowning in sorrow is a lifestyle to suffer
Make sure you are the only bluffer!
Big blind special!!!

Roll the dice - choose your side and be a man
Roll the dice - wanna end up in a trash can?
Roll the dice... Dice
Roll the dice
Roll the fucking dice
Roll the dice
