So you think you had a bad day?
Maybe a nightmare that did not go away?
And now this will become your uniformity
If you don't rule out your individuality

We are forced!
We are ruled!
We are divorced!
It's up to you - to be fooled!!!

Hell - come to the freakshow!
Hell - come to the freakshow!
Hell - come to the freakshow!
The advantage is to goddamned fucking know
Hell - come to the freakshow!
It's our spectacle - make their minds blow!

We are all caught in a scary cage
Of routine, greed, envy and rage
The challenge is on - take it now
It's all up to you: disallow!

We are forced!
We are ruled!
We are divorced!
It's up to you - to be fooled!!!

Hell - come to the freakshow!
Hell - come to the freakshow!
Hell - come to the freakshow!
The advantage is to goddamned fucking know
Hell - come to the freakshow!
It's our spectacle - make their minds blow!

Appreciation you should never expect
Your attempts you should never regret
The day will come when you feel retrieved
After all the dirt and shit you have received

Individuality is a high goal
Worldwide it is a punchbowl
But if you look at our history
Where the hell would our world be?

Without those who we once exiled
Our being could never be reconciled!
Without the freaks that changed our bloody minds
We wouldn't have the guidelines of mankind!

We are forced!
We are ruled!
We are divorced!
It's up to you to be fooled!!!

Hell - come to the freakshow
Hell - come to the freakshow
Hell - come to the freakshow
The advantage is to goddamned fucking know
Hell - come to the freakshow
It's our spectacle - make their minds blow!
Hellcome!!!
