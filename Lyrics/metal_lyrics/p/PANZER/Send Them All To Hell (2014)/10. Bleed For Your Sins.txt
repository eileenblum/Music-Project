Stranger than fiction - I'm here to stay
I ignored all the rules - I did it my own way
My way or the highway - my slogan to score
I was the bloody master of the fucking war!

Turn blood into water
Turn whisky to wine
Prove your existence
Prove you are divine!!!

You gotta:
Bleed - bleed for your sins
In this world evil never wins?
You gotta:
Bleed - bleed for your sins
Love &amp; hate are twisted twins!

I will die - with a beer in my hand
Never take oppressions - will be my last stand
You might laugh now - at my philosophy
Let my dream come true - me or you?

Turn blood into water
Turn whisky to wine
Prove your existence
Prove you're divine!!!

You gotta:
Bleed - bleed for your sins
In this world evil never wins?
You gotta:
Bleed - bleed for your sins
Love &amp; hate are twisted twins!

Living in the land of Hades
In the land of the dead
Living in the curse of believing
Oppressed by the words someone said...

Is it too late now? Is it too late?

Doubt! Shout!
Never give up - shout it out loud
Be proud! The crowd!
Doubt! Shout!
Never give up - shout it out loud
Be proud - the crowd
Never give up - shout it out loud

Turn blood into water
Turn whisky to wine
Prove your existence
Prove you're divine!!!

You gotta:
Bleed - bleed for your sins
In this world evil never wins?
You gotta:
Bleed - bleed for your sins
Love &amp; hate are twisted twins!

Doubt! Shout!
Never give up - shout it out loud
Be proud! The crowd!
Doubt! Shout!
Be proud - the crowd
