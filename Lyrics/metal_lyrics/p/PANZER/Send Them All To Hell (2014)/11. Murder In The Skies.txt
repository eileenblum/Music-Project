[originally by Gary Moore]Time was running out for all on board
Soaring up through the shadows of night
High above the clouds the engines roared
This would be their final flight

The Russians have shot down a plane on its way to Korea
Two hundred and sixty-nine innocent victims have died

Murder in the skies
Came without a warning
Murder in the skies
Black September morning
Murder in the skies

Time was running out for everyone
Flying over the sea of Japan
None would live to see the rising sun
Death was following close at hand

The Russians have shot down a plane on its way to Korea
Two hundred and sixty-nine innocent victims have died

Murder in the skies
Came without a warning
Murder in the skies
Black September morning

Murder in the skies
Came without a warning
Murder in the skies
Black September morning

Murder in the skies
Came without a warning
Murder in the skies
Black September morning

Murder in the skies
Came without a warning
Murder in the skies
Black September morning

Murder in the skies, murder in the skies
Murder in the skies
Murder, murder in the skies
Murder in the skies
