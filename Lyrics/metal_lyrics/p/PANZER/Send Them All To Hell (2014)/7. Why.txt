I see these eyes hiding behind lies
A guilty look learned its lesson in life

Defender of the faith
Or Decalogue No. eighth?
Legal science? Self reliance?
A culture clash or compliance?

Why - why - can't you hear the desperate cry?
Why - why - criticize and hit the bullseye!

I see sadness in the eye of madness
Not a fulfilled soul that wollows in gladness

Defender of the faith
Or Decalogue No. eighth?
Legal science? Self reliance?
A culture clash or compliance?

Why - why - can't you hear the desperate cry?
Why - why - criticize and you will hit the bullseye!

Must a credo always be a retrenchment of rights?
A clean soul of innocence looking for reminiscence?

In a world that's full of uncrowned queens
Where blind lead the blind beyond any means

Individuality should be the incarmet coal
They wanna steal your personality and make u play a role!!!

Why - why - can't you hear the desperate cry?
Why - why - criticize and you will hit the bullseye!
Goodbye - goodbye... Listen to your mind's eye - defender of the faith
Goodbye - goodbye... In religion there's no good guy!

Goodbye!!!
