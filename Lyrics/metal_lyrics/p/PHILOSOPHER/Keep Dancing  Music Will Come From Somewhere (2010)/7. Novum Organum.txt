Slipped through the trunk
Inside the cave
Throught the market
Enter The theater glory
The hazeimages and incorrect concepts
Long occupation of the human intellect

Deep roots in the wild
And the only way to make it difficult
To the human mind to the truth
If the road is now open.

Created for themselves
Fantasy creator

Novum organum
Novum organum
Novum organum
Novum organum

This can easily be worn
As is often the intolerable reality
The man only sees what he wants to see
The question isn't that man can do much more

But that nature has yet to bear much
conflicts, duality, syllogism

...Things you cannot formulate

Novum organum
Novum organum
Novum organum

Underlying
And explain human
much can and should receive,
taken for the Order 
Of the facts of nature
Or observed through his mind:
No more don't know and can do
No more don't know and can do

Tool and appliance needs of the intelligence
As well as the hand.
And as soon as the trigger hand tools
And control the movement
Or just help protect
The meaning of mental tools

Novum organum
