Inner forces breaks out to the surface
The mechanism sweeps throught my soul
Catastrophes are going to come
Don't say that isn't your fault

Recover your senses
The Power is infinite
Systems run in thy 
Energetic and material

We are treating thy like 
Enemies
Ohhhh
Don't we?

There is order in the nature
It isn't the man who must make order
Instead should we wonder and respect
The organizational process that's going on there

Recover your senses
The Power is infinite
Systems run in thy 
Energetic and material

We have to conclude the most important alliance
so that when we can recognise our place undertake our role
And for something else will be touched by the happiness

We have to conclude the most important alliance
So that when we are ready for the champing
With our fellow creatures we can shining away

So Understand the law, the reason
And the goal of the World
With today's tendencies comes loss of finer 
and more important things

Conclude the alliance

Don't be surprised if the tsunami exterminates you!
Don't be surprised if the tornado overthrows you!
Don't be surprised if the earthquake swallows you!
Don't be surprised if the lava floods you!

Conclude the alliance
