Clear goals 
Concentrating
A loss of the feeling 
Of self-consciousness
Distorted sense of time

Balance 
Between ability level 
And challenge
A sense 
Of personal control 
Over the aspect

Direct and immediate feedback
Completely focused motivation. 
a single-minded immersion
Energized, aligned with the duty at hand
The hallmark of flow is a feeling of (spontaneous) joy
Even rapture while performing a task

People become 
absorbed in their pursuit
The activity is essentially rewarding
The mental state of operation

In which 
the person is fully immersed
In what we are doing by a feeling 
Of energized focus, full involvement,
