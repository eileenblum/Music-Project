Under the waves my sleep was broke
Under the scars my blood was froz'
Seasons are dancing above my head
Souround me an aura of Death
Everything has a price here
Come let here be fight for
This lost way

Imperium
the age into where I born
Imperium
when life means nothing
Imperium
what I try to accept
Imerium
when apocalypse begin
Imperium

Who cares about destiny?
You can feel the sinister misery
I feel the hopefull regret
If you like it come and take it

Imperium
the age where I admire the flight
Imperium
where my wounds burn more
Imperium
what came after the last scream
Imperium
where our course trapped here
Imperium

I feel the hopefull regret
If you like it come and take it
If you like it come and take it!

Everybody has an own cross to bear
If you're not blind, you see the point
You get a clear picture of it
Destiny dancing on a rope
Below the raving is wide open for you

Towers are building
On the world and trumble down
This is the begining of the end,
The end of the begining now
I should depends on your fate
I should make myself on pain too
Maybe I will burry you... 

Ohh why I must to woke up here
Ohh At the gates you'll get everything what you deserve
