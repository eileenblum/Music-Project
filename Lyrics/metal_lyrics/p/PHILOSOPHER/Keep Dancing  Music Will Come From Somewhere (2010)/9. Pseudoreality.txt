Who wants to silence, rise to circumstances 
In which it's impossible to hear anything

try 
to fly, 
false
belief
feel 
to dare
what
we don't 
see

What is the real and what is the false
What we can see that is it to be

try 
to fly, 
false
belief
feel 
to dare
what
we don't 
see

Lies by the life without solution

Untrue words break the silence
innocent simple perception in our hand
smashing the ideas, enjoying new waves
but the problem stay here we can't recive

What is the real and what is the false
What we can see that is it to be

Who wants to silence, rise to circumstances 
In which it's impossible to hear anything

Light on things above
What we believed maybe is a fateful orbital fake
We have the same organs 
but we cannot feel what the others
Tembling the theories

try 
to fly, 
false
belief
feel 
to dare
what
we don't 
see

In scars we boil the time into the deeper sea 
with the mankind not closer to see

Where is the place of the justice for me?
If I want to go to the trees?
