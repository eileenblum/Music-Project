Finding phenomenon in the world
with conntact to our brain

Catching the embers
of outward stuggles what made by us and god

Generates particular sights
what the mankind cannot easy recognise
Like invisible wounds in our lifetime
Taken me into this place

Catching the embers
of outward stuggles what made by us and god

The Hidden Dimension
Lost and found
The Hidden Dimension
listened hides

Generates particular sights
what the mankind cannot easy recognise
Like invisible wounds in our lifetime
Taken me into this place

Places formed through the ground
Smells what I can't identified
Touches are lost in the air
Voices call me but I can't to feel

Entering into imperceptible pieces of time
into unsighted space of our life
into something what we have never been seen
into inconceivable constitutions of our brain

The silent language of the man
independent communication
what the world suggests to us
You pay me a million dollars 
If I tell you where is god,
And I pay you double-you 
If you tell me where it is not

Generates particular sights
what the mankind cannot easy recognise
Like invisible wounds in our lifetime
Taken me into this place

Catching the embers
of outward stuggles what made by us and god

The Hidden Dimension
Lost and found
The Hidden Dimension
Listened hides
The Hidden Dimension
Listened hides
Lost and found
