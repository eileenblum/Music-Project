The reason it is the rule of man
Before the subjects were given
All knowledge begins with experience
But not all of it comes from
Conflicting statements
Truth and falsehood are equally valid
Can't be solved with a clean mind

Prove equally
Exclude each other
It's impossible to decide
Acceptable contradictions

Critique of pure reason
The tribunal of mind
From the limit of our brains
Comes supernatural sights

Prove equally
Exclude each other
It's impossible to decide
Acceptable contradictions

Finiteness and infinity
Material of the (infinite) divisibility
Cause of the existence of the world
Necessity and freedom

Issues
That are not recognized at the pure sense of light

God is the moral postulate of spirit and mind
Their existence we can't prove or disprove
For us the intelligibilic world objects 
Are inaccessible

The reason it is the rule of man
Before the subjects were given
All knowledge begins with experience
But not all of it comes from
Conflicting statements
Truth and falsehood are equally valid
Certain skills lead to insane

I felt the vibrating of this mental level
An interal hand pull back and all is lost
