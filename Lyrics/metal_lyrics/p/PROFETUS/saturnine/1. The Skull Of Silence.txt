Crawling wraith comes in deep wreckage of night
Searing from the fear of mute existence
Inside the open wound
I am grasped in secret longing
Caught by her Unlight
In a dream of dead Womb

Beyond this soul I am freezing
In the stillness of your voice
Beyond this soul I am descending
To meet Death in final hour

The Angel of my natural shadow
Whispers deep in the light
My blood comes drifting still weary of dawn
Raining on the August face of Night

Beyond this Funereal veil of darkness
Cursed for eternities
Beyond the Solace Night
We unite in the cold grasp of Aeons
The burden of life relinquished
Into stillness of Death
