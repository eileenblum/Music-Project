Trees shadow lines my face an Ancient tresspass
I bleed from deep inner stigmatas
Of the black catalyst
Buried in time

The withered graves covered
only by the found of falling snow
Endlessly drifting in a shape of star
Deeper in the sad song of Saturnine Night

On the arms of Weeping Mother
Lies the burning will of Winter

Towards the Ancient stars
And Magical gateways
Dreams that dwell
in sickness and Death
Swallowed by the Emerald Snow
Falling from trees
Eternal from here...
