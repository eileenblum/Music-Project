Â»I sleep beside you
Breathless in the casket of wood
Softly in the withered bed of hays

I dream as you are asleep
Holding this circle of hands
And under my feet, the dying flowersÂ«

Carrying out the flame to the Eve

To Open the passages in Dusk and to enter the Night
when the souls will coil to the ancient stars

Where only sacred footprints remain
In the ever falling snow
My soul is a candle
Lit towards the end of time

Under cold spears of Saturnine bliss
To the solemn pulse of elder-night

The watchers fire kindles in the distance
and emanations reach this morbid heart
Like elemental tails of prophecy
Shedding light of the most radiant star
