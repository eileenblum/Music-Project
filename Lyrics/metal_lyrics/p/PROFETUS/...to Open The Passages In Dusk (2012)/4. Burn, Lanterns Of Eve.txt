Following the lanterns glow
we have reached the passage of night
Burning clear from the mist of the years
no more a stride for his longing soul

Turning paths to the oldest of misery
His hearts contempt
The black sun on its billows
The prophecy - freezing his flesh

The cry of reversed star disappears
falling to the motherâs cold arms
Burning the trees wreath, once ever-green
the golden cloak to ash

And all the north winds
cease their howl
Remembering
The fires of the shore

Burning his heart
with their dismal calling
The shroud of death falls
and cold aeons await

Our torches dim and pale
over the ever-descending night
what is to become and remembered
is only here to pass

As the darkness will fall upon us
