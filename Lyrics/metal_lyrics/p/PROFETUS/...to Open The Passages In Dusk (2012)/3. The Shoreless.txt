The fires burn as the dismal shore seems to perish
Like the quietus of his dying dream
Softly grasping the infinite, the shoreless escapes
Like silver beams they travel the swell

In their cold remembrance
where moon drank the waters venery
A gaze of silver to its bleak fathoms,
where a painful oath was thrown
Dying words broken into silent bliss of soul

And no light shall escape his brow
Like waves once leave the shore, never to return
As the haven breaks to nothingness

Â»And like his tears, they will melt the stone
Over harbouring night
Receiving only death or life
UnknownÂ«
