Kindle, quiet flame
and carry these weightless candles of dawn
Lay waste these broken woes
on the warm wave of summer air

Kindle, this reverie
of sheltered darkness
across the waters calm eye
With the bygone clasp of centuries

The pulse of waves against the rocks
Swelling from the ageless shore
Coiling around the endless rhyme
Like sun-rays on the quiet billows

Kindle, this epitaph
Against this quiet painting of godless nature
Breathe on the pulse of wind in the trees
Ever-green shade lit by the evening stars

Sleep, my weary heart
Deep in the warm chest of the earth
Flee, escape the winters white hand of death
Return to the summer never-ending

"Where the birds weave their song
On the tall trees distant hum
And the north winds cease
To carry the voices past

Alone as the eye of the night-sky
that cradles the gardens of stars
I'll forever return to these quiet shores
as my candle fades and the twilight's gone...
