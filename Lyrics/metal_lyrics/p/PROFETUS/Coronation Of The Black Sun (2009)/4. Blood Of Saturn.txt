Forever dying never dead, an old man
Something like bile in his veins, as it seems
"The serpent did breath it unto my face," you say

"As I was younger and blazing
Now I am extinguished.... solid stone"

Archaic darkness, from wherein dawns the Night
"Like a starving man in the desert would suck blood
from his very own body,"
or like a snake
above devours its tail to renew its scales
Unchanging father of all change

Saturn, Beholding Abyss, the Last Mover,
deep core of being, father of eternities
"Before there was matter,
I have been,
only fools connect me with that which can
someday perish
Did you think me as the Adversary?"

In this tower, besieged by many a silence
Based on the permant rock of nothing
Surrounded by white kingdom of ice
Countless reversed stars above

I am the secret master of your blood
