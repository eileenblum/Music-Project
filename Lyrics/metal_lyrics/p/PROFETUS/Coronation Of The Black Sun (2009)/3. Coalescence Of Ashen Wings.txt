Fallen stars
Under the quiet sun of Capricorn
Will I embrace the madrigal of streams?
Within the sheltered darkness of my flesh
Suffering the astral pain

Harvest

The Ever grey fields of souls remembrance
where frigid lovers bleed to death
The mourning light shall bury the secret
When heavens are dropping with black seed
of Doom

Like ghosts upon mercury sleep we lie awake
The dismal lovers tied to a sharp immediation
By the warm blood of the stars

As the lifes Shepherd has lost all hope
Granted to burn in solid stakes of the world
To walk this heaving earth
In cursed procession

When it all ends in desolated ruins
The child of Saturn awakes
with ashen wings (into the bliss of wind)
drifting against the stream
