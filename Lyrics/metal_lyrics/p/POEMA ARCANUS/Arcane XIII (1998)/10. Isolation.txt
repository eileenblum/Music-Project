[L: Igor L. and Claudio C. M: Igor L.]

Isolating myself, from a thousand lies
From all those empty plights, avoid all that hurts

No contact with external, entombed in my mind
Coldness surrounds me, like a womb of thorns

[Chorus x2:]

Like a shivering stone
Covered by a shivering hand

A pale, static face, behind a misty glass
Denying the ritual, erasing all codes

Cast away from this, a world which I will leave
Just longing for the call of my bitter god

[Chorus x2]

Silently, Tacitly, in an endless row
Ageless images, call you by an unknown name

Endlessly in the hollow age, always to lie outside
So it was written, so I will suffer
