[L. and M: Igor L.]

As I'm trying to approach
Through this landscape of the unknown
Whispers of the wise, in the air
Love, sex, nature's traps for the mortal men

[Chorus:]

Female poison I will drink,
And I'll die in your arms by ecstasy
Female poison close my eyes
Rip my veins with your condemned cries

Try to understand with my logic
What no logic can understand
My naked soul, day by day weakens
For your honey tasting blood

[Chorus]

I can't pretend
It was not a surprise
It will never end
My frustration to own
What I will never have...
Have no excuse
Just cannot lie
This sweetness will never be mine

[Chorus]
