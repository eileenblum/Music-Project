[L: Claudio C. M: Igor L.]

I'm weak...
Exhausted by this feeling
It is all over
And nothing makes me change my mind

Who are you?
My god?
Why me...?
Why do you take my essence, away?

[Chorus:]

I deny your name; your death is my rest
And your presence makes me hate all
Annulling my bliss, breaking my unique peace
You killed my love

[Chorus]
