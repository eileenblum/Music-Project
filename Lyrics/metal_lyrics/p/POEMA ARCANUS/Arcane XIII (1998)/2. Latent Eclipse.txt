[L: Claudio C. and Igor M: Igor L.]

The autumn comes back to my internal world
I'm defeated by the life
Each dawn awakes with the same tortuous feeling
The same bitter swallow

[Chorus:]

I want to live no more
With grief in my veins, without hope

I don't know if you can understand me
If you can help me
Regrettably your ambitious advice doesn't help me
Because it's in my blood

[Chorus:]

The fields of my rest
My grievous redemption
On thorns I will lay numb
I draw a relieving smile while I bleed

Love wasn't enough
It's been tainted by pain
Colours have turned into grey
My farewell tastes like resurrection

My days are cloudy, by this almighty depression
Like a latent eclipse
Condemned in my own essence, immune to the happiness
I'm blessed by death

[Chorus]
