[Lyrics and Music: Claudio B.]

... Can you keep a secret?

At night's darkest time
Silent and barefoot I run ... I run
While in dreams, everybody lie
To be witness, to be witness

My shadow makes no comments
As I climb the mountains ... of life
Or as I go down into the valley's depths
To be witness, to be witness

And there in the great blackness
A rose starts to grow, giving life
For a child to be witness
Or leaving a man to die

So I've been witness, so I've been witness

So, can you keep a secret?
