[L: Claudio C., M: Igor L.]

The life is so fragile and our time here is so short
Accustomed to this reality, we'll never touch the truth
The vastness blinds us and our minds cry
Cry under the insecurity of the unknown... unknown

And what then comes? , nothingness, nobody knows
Days, years pass and nothing really changes.
We are waiting for a sign, but it never comes
Our ignorance persists until the last moment on this world... this world.

..... We're in grief and uncertainty...

[Chorus *2]
Trying to define my true existence,
My real life, but there's no light.

Time doesn't stop, one by one we begin to fall
Fears, cries for our lives that leave us without advice.
And we think that, our existence is so wretched
Day by day we walk to the end and we live only for dying ... for dying
