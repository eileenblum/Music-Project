[L and M : Igor L.]

Walk alone for years
Through timeless sands
The sun is my burden
And the shame marks my path

Life lies beneath
Under timeless sands
Barefoot on warm blood
Sorrows start to grow...
Sorrows start to grow!

[Chorus:]
Was my rest a sin?
The weight of timeless sands I'd never felt
Now is too late for me!
Timeless sands ... bury me deeply...

Follow my journey for a lifetime
See my limbs, now they're weak
A numb soul and a blind heart
A life covered by sand.

..... Timeless sands ... [x2]

Timeless sands!

[Chorus x2]
