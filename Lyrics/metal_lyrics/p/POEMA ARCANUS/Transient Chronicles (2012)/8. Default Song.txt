Again it will begin 
this joy I will let in 
a stranger is now welcome 

these sparkling lights drowning me 
no boundaries to see 
just unknown faces 

a deafening noise perpetuates 
so many voices claim 
and these walls of ice rise inside me 

From this place, the electric maze 
is all the world I've seen, 
just a movie on my screen 
a thousand words, the elusive world 
a landscape without soul; 
so synthetic, so absurd 

Lost in the endless flow 
Silicon dreams remain 
Reality starts to fade 
Lost in the endless flow 
Silicon nightmares 
Everything is so unreal 

So lonely in the crowd 
the scream I once heard loud 
Seems like a whisper now 

my message lost, unheard, astray 
my mind speaks by mistake 
to unknown faces 

No one to see, no one to touch 
Nobody cared too much 
When these walls of ice 
grew inside me 

From this place 
This empty space 
This only world for me 
Just come here and taste how 
To exist â to disappear 
To feel â or just to pretend 
To love and to betray 
Are such different parts 
of the same game
