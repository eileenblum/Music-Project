[Lyrics: Claudio Carrasco ]
[Music: Luis Moya - Igor Leiva]

All the freedom we want 
He strives to make it impossible 
And as we try to see colours, 
He systematically stains everything black
A vicious circle that consumes life 
As time runs fast, existence spills from our hands
Relentless process that never ends 
Driving us to lose control of our lives
Feel the doom, embrace the antagonism 
Fake freedom is our opium and death
Failure by failure, we feel them as steps 
The old opponent knows and profits from them
The healer who provides the cure 
Smiles in the darkness while the disease is born
We bear everyday, the weight of the engine 
A crippled system that swallows life
Paying with blood, the price of existence 
And the right to live our own agony
An infant painfully learning the rules 
Hope slowly fades within a young naive soul
The puppet tracing plans for his route 
Becomes the old man dying alone and poor
And as we try to open our eyes 
Omniscient opponent kills the light .
