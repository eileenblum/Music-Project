A cold dawn of autumn
And the blood announces the worst
As the deepest sorrow comes
We begin to ride... on death's horse

The woods seem to hold our room
Covering the light inside the womb

The ten percent begins to be true
The standards abandoned us
She discovered our paradise
Turned it into pale void

Our love this time is not enough
Our faith is useless
So please take care of our little blood
Oh earth and water...

Nowadays we follow
The doctrine of the hidden mourning
As an internal deep wound
Pain is dressed as fake joy

Everyone seems to enjoy their luck
While we drown in a lake of loss

The ten percent begins to be true
The standards abandoned us
She discovered our paradise
Turned it into pale void

Our love this time is not enough
Our faith is useless
So please take care of our little blood
Oh earth and water...

Statistics against dreams,
They mock tragedy

Life... You betrayed us
Time... Could you cure us?
Blood... Come back to us
Probability rules the earth...
It Rules death
