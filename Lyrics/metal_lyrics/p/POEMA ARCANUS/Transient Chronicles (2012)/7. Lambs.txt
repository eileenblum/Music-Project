The Shepherd guides his flock 
through a holy path marked with blood 
driving them to a carnage yet unknown 

Procession marches to the cliff 
A cliff bathed by souls 
One by one lambs fall into the void 

An old lie teaching for centuries 
sustaining a perpetual profit of souls 
Loved unconditionally until their death 
Then after death, God devours his sons 

Repeating the word of the lord 
Blessed lambs on their way to heaven 
Then they realize salvation turns into free fall 
All their beliefs 
Vanish as they fall 
Everything turns into cold horror 

A sea of the dead, known as heaven 
Ruled by a beast called Father 
As souls are drowned into the depths 
A morbid grin is drawn on his face 
For a lifetime 
I was fooled into his good will 
Now I'm falling 
Without his fake mercy 

As I'm drowning, water dissolves faith 
All the answers turn into childhood fears 
And I realize nobody ever supported my way 
I'm astray, forgotten in this ocean... 
of misery and death 
I wasted life, to feed the father's vicious hunger 

He never wanted 
to welcome us in his reign 
Used us to procreate 
and nourish the make-believe fiend
