[Lyrics &amp; music: Igor Leiva]

The last days of summer
Through storms and distress
Blind of the frailty
Drifted out of place

The logic of carbon
The fate of living things close
A grip to reality I never asked for
Then this old superhero
Became a little wounded bird
The path we all follow
Crumbling down before my eyes

So calm yet so bitter
Attachment with nature
Fading light sparkles
Still unexplained

Flesh shelters life
Flesh shelters sickness
The answers lost into cold
White labyrinth talk

Life is a runaway
From shelters and from prisons.
Encounters and loss draw
This complex map of time.
