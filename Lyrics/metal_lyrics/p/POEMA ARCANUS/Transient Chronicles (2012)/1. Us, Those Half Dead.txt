[Lyrics: Claudio Carrasco / Music: Igor Leiva]

Never imagined what Iâm realizing, indeed
Sudden proof of cryptic face
You, half-dead.

Thousands of fears, explains themselves
As a grim puzzle,
the truth emerges from depths

Beauty caresses gently the dead
A caress given back as a ruthless pest

Words sound unknown,
canÂ´t understand
Dead fading colors,
your skins turned ashes grey

A long season in darkness,
one sorrow after the other,
no rest for dead side arises
Death taking over me

A breeding ground to forget respect
Infection progress slowly
Taking control of our will

Far away from me, you call my name
Distance translates it as a scream

Us, those half-dead
Breed at the bottom of our disgrace.
