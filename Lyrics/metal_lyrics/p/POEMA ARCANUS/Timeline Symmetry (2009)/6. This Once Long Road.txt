I've already eaten all the sweetest fruits
A train I didn't see pass
Didn't realize there was an ending
This ending that came a lot sooner than expected

Of this once long road, now I can see the end
All my treasures lost, all my memories fade

A whole life under the illusion, naive tales about another life
No one's gonna give it back, time this time is not on my side...

That's all it was, no replay, no second chance, no turning back
A life now built on memories just seeking comfort in the past
That's all it was, couldn't get it, couldn't catch it, could not seize it
When life parades in front of your eyes

Faith and hope provided the wicked fuel to survive
Through a blind trip towards desert and sterile lands
Then something went wrong on this absurd lifetime plan
I'm here stranded with a dream burnt by the sun

No stories of bravery to be told or to make up
I'm trying to save something out of this forgotten role
Approaching the end of the road
Facing the end of the road

That's all it was, no replay, no second chance, no turning back
A life now built on memories just seeking comfort in the past
That's all it was, couldn't get it, couldn't catch it, could not seize it
When life parades in front of your eyes...
