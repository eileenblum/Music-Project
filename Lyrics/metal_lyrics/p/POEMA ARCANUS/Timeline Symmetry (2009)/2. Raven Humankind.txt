Twenty one centuries of time
Telluric plans carved in stone, re-wrote in anonymous keyboards
E-system can't decode her cries
Infection grows by holy tentacles, of a god who buys disciples

It is no future, the end of times
Raven humankind, eats the mother's eyes
Worm's nature, leeches the other's lives
Raven humankind

Devour purity... essence denial

It is no future, the end of times
Raven humankind, eats the mother's eyes
Worm's nature, leeches the other's lives
Raven humankind

Scavengers and parasites of the warm fountain of life
Consuming even the last bone
We are the dirty tiny beasts
Breeding, crawling, stealing, infecting
Raping, betraying, torturing, killing

Twenty one centuries of time
Life, love and death can be bought at market's price

It is no future, the end of times
Raven humankind, eats the mother's eyes
Worm's nature, leeches the other's lives
Raven humankind

As hungry dogs without memory we bite the hand that feeds
With holy waters unanimated by Jesus Christ
Humanity irrigates the lands to harvest ravenous still life
