In those ripping moments
When you go down on your knees
As a death knell, night falls on you

Walls grow high around you, burying yourself deep inside
Under the surface, world forces down
What... can you see?
...Other unknown skies...

In a whole dark infinity, lifetime yearnings you left behind
Forget your loved ones, love agonizes
Out of the physical essence flies
You... you are lost in time...

Back to your mother's womb, the unborn child
Survives his first trial, neo natal problems arise
Madness lightnings
From childhood to enslavement
A life punctured by infected needles

Feel the outside life's desires, peel your aged slave skin
Fall into the abyssal dreams, straight to the bottom
Eyes wide open see nothing... close your eyes... still the same
Freefall into darkness, zoom to the void

The living dead one graduated from first hell
Beginning a new stage, about problems arise
Death lightnings
From enslavement to obliteration
Elderness slashed by toxic razors

Feel the outside life's desires, peel your aged slave skin
Fall into the abyssal dreams, straight to the bottom
Eyes wide open see nothing... close your eyes... still the same
Freefall into darkness, zoom to the void
