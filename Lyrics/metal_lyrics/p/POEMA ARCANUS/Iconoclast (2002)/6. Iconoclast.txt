[Lyrics: Claudio Carrasco / Music: Igor Leiva]

Cliffs of contradiction
You'll feel the fury of waves 

Rocks stare at the dawn / Awaiting the tides to be praised 
We're coming here, to erase thy shapes
Tonight is the night / In the calmness of the dark
We're coming here, to erase thy shapes 

[Chorus:]
No plea's been heard
Rusted structures are falling
Creating a new era
In crawling sands 
The icons will be torn
Creating a new era

A still picture in blue / (Underlying) forces breed
A liquid hate will come from the depths
Drowning all eternal / An ancient rage is unleashed 
A liquid hate will come from the depths 

[Chorus:]

All this handcrafted pain, all these pictures of suffering
My eyes can now see, but I cannot feel... and I shall not regret 

[Final Chorus:]

No plea was heard
Rusted structures no longer exist 
Creating a new era
In crawling sands 
The icons will be torn
Creating a new era
