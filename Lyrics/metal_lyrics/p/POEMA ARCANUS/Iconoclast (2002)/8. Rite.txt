[Lyrics &amp; music: Igor Leiva]

These walls of stone have witnessed
How I've learned to praise the sun
Forces once spoke through me
And taught me their sacred song
Silently the stone... remembers... now 

Now I'm the outcast in a time of blind spirits
But I feel the earth, I hear the earth 

Somber skies fall upon us
Feel this rage... unleashed? 

My story won't be heard by the withered souls that laugh
But I feel the earth, I hear the earth 

Speak to me of your beliefs and I will show you my gods
They'll rule over all, as you ignore... Ignore 

My flesh and soul have been tied, with every little part
Something denied by this time, somehow my instincts understand 

As one with nature, like a naked child
Longing for his mother's womb
My lonely rite shall live... as long as I 

These walls of stone have witnessed
How I've learned to praise the sun
Forces once spoke through me
And taught me their sacred song
