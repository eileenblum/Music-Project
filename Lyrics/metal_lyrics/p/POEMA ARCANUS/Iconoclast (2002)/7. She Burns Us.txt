[Lyrics: Claudio Carrasco / Music: Igor Leiva]

[Chorus:]
It is the nature of all things and all men
The blood has called her child for many years
And there is no way to resist her
I will crawl like a spider, small, dirty and free 

On this night I will hide myself from your light
And turn loose these desires hidden under dust
Three times I will sin, three times I will deny
Only myself and the ashes of my past 

As I jump into the void, this bet I have lost
The pleasure of risk in this fragile existence
I have no answers, so don't ask for regrets
...And let me dream in life...so deep... 

[Chorus:]

The light gives life... but it also takes it away 

She burns us with every, tick of the clock
I'm drowning in this addiction to burn with her
And the beliefs of my past life
With her and the beliefs of my past life
