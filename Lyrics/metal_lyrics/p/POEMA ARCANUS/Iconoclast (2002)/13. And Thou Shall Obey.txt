[Lyrics: Claudio Botarro / Music: Michel Leroy &amp; Igor Leiva]

Can't understand love through fear,
And life without the blessing
Of my birthright 

So from thy heavens, built of mothers
who can't feed their own sons
I'll fall again... to drown in ecstasy... 

Into this burning place
Stage of anxious flesh
Innocence and disgrace... are alive 

My child releases my hand
And wondered, he runs to the sweet fountain
Quenching his thirst,
Pure child 

Nailed to a well learned ignorance,
You cannot touch paradise 

Your child releases your hand
And faraway he runs from the sweet fountain
Ashamed of himself, 
Poor child 

Living your life in this maze
Like an echo or a slave 

Inside your soul you refuse to see
Misery is disguised as salvation 

Omnipotent sadism, life and death in fear
... And thou shall obey 

Omnipresent voyeurism, extinct privacy
... And thou shall obey 

Omniscient tyranny, the bonfire of all dreams 
... And thou shall obey
