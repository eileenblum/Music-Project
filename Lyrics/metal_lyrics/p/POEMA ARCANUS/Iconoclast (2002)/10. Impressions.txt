[Lyrics &amp; music: Michel Leroy]

Between my death and infinity... 

Amazed by the colours of eternity...of eternity 

Into insanity's claws
So much existence is lost
So much ecstasy gone 

Bow down to the forces that gave us our random shape 

The eternal explosion
or the phantom statement
Man is the endless mirror
and the darkness is not so (real) 

This suffering isn't haunting
for the one who knows,
for the one who is
already touching ...his gods 

Fears cast the gesture of horror
Cloaked around humanity
Afraid of next step
Fear to continue 

New stares emerge
A more complete state of mind
rips the one that escaped 

No way out.
No way out from here
This is the new joy (The new joy which we feel)
