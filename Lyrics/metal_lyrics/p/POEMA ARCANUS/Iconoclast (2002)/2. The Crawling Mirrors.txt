[Lyrics: Claudio Botarro / Music: Igor Leiva]

The grey southern ghosts...again
Announce me (falling in silence)...that
The Crawling mirrors
Are coming for us. 

Blinded by / their shining skin
By their colours / We're trapped helplessly 

Taking away all that we have
Taking away our joys and cries 

Travelling through / the endless currents
(Drifting) our best / and sweetest memories 

Watch the horizon when they are gone
Watch them burning by the sun 

Sardonic movements of fate 

And today I make this toast
I raise my glass, and drown... and drown all my pain.
