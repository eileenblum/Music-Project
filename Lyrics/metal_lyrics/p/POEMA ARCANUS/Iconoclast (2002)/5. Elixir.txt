[Lyrics: Claudio Carrasco / Music: Igor Leiva]

Drink of this potion brought from the night
Dark human night, your scent deep inside
Of a sea in which thoughts fly 

Forgotten passions appear like stars in the night sky
Undress your skin and soil it with guilt 

...and soil it with guilt... 

[Chorus:]
Blessed by the moonlight
Drink this blood from... the earth 

Ensure your destiny, write it with a fantasy
The pain has no limit, let it free like a bird...let it free 

Wounds with each movement, scrub the hand in a rose
A soul trapped in a maze, a moment for the fire 

... a moment for the fire... 

[Chorus:]

In the shadows
We became gods... of flesh
.... With this blood from the earth.... 

Drink of this blood from the earth
