[Lyrics &amp; music: Igor Leiva]

Now is your time to fade into this uncertain night
Now is your time to freeze the moments crystallized 

[Pre Chorus:]
And even if I struggled with fate
You would run free and be disowned 
And if the words are sounding strange
Then their meaning is clear 

[Chorus:]
As the loss steals my breath
As a part of me dies
I look back
And I see the path, I will never walk again 

Just sleep my friend in this garden of memories
Just sleep and keep time standing still 

[Pre Chorus]
[2 X Chorus]

Trying to bring back a past already dead
I will fail... anyway
A complete circle I try to destroy
I will fail... anyway 

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

The distance attempts
To dissolve the memory
But in the end
These old crystals I will take to my grave
