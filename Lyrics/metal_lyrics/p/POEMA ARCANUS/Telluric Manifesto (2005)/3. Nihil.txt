When partner wine tastes like acid vinegar
And everythingÂ´s been expelled from me... at the depths
Outside father sun is laughing, he can not see me
I hear his voice, but I can not feel his heat

I gave until feeling as dead, even my last vestiges
A cold broken tank, the soul spills slowly
Could you drain it all from me? Just sweep away the ground
I'm awaiting the void, naked and numb

Dark mother loneliness embraces her dying child
Scorned at birth, he was conceived to die

He can see nothing, back into a deadly womb
Then the vast non-spaces grow, nothingness increases

Because all I had I gave... I gave to the winds
I trusted, they deceived, stole me

Now I'm one of the doomed poorest beings
We all live at the Nihil, together but alone

Resigned to know I cannot die again
I have no chance, just living here
Walking barefoot through these arcane lands

While you beg for the carnal ghost penetration

Nihil
