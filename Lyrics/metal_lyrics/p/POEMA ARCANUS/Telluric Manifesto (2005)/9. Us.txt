One hundred ninety... worn out!

They cannot be again...
Cannot repeat...
She was only her...
He was only him...

Never again!
There is a dangerous humanity...
Which can kill me, or the ones I love

We are the murderer
We are the undertaker
We are the mourner

The earth is dangerous...
Can I trust in you?
Can you trust in me?
Can I trust in me?
Stone gods
Now... can I trust in you?
