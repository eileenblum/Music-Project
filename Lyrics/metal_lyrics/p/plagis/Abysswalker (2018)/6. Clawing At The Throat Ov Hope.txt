I dig myself out from the grave
And I stand straight by your side
I brush the mud off of my clothes
And now I know the chill of death

Knives in the dark put an end to suspicion
Cloak and dagger politics
Out of hand
Out of commission

Buried alive but I'll never die
Not with Satan on my side
Burn forever in their light
Stand aside, now watch and die!

Relics, gold and fortune
All toys and trinkets to he
Who rule over all!

Your books, your scriptures
The sacred word of your prophet
Will burn in their light

I clawed at coffin lids
As I claw into your eyes
I call upon the tides to sink you down to the dirt
I claw at your flesh
Primitive. Weak. Coward!

Clawing at the throat ov hope
I'll take it all away from you
Bestowing plagues and fever
Just for my amusement
It's what you deserve
All taken away

I'll bury you as you buried me
This time, you'll truly die
With the glory and faith in Satan
You will burn in his light

An army of darkness
Reveals its true face
Rise up and embrace the fate
Clawing at the throat of Hope!
