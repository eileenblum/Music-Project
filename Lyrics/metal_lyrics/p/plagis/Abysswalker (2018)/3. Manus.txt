Malice
All that remains
Dwelling down here in the dark

Manus
Reigning supreme
Extinguish the fire and the spark

Dwelling
Falling down
Deeper than was ever known

Twisting
Their feeble minds
Infecting us with what is shown

I can see inside you
I can sense your fear
I can hear your heartbeat
I know your time is near

Liquefy their insides
To purify their minds
Leave a trail of wretched blood
In this undead shrine

I'll take the light from your eyes
I'll take the soul from your corpse
I'll take the crown from your head
Then I'll take your life

I'll bury you down in this grave
Pit of the depraved
I'm saved
Yet your lifeless body remains
