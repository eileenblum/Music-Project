Ascend the steps and part the gates
Your storied destiny awaits
Before you stood in that gold room
Will forever be your doom

Two iron clad soldiers unite
To protect the vessel as is their right
Beyond them lies the Queen of Gods
A bitter end you'll face tonight

Laughing!
The sick fuck enjoys your death
Smiling!
Savouring every dying breath
Killing!
He smashes you into the ground
Tasting!
Your body and he's proud

Heart still beating yet
Trapped inside the walls
You begin to cry
As once again your sword falls

I still remember the taste of your blood
The flavour of your skin
I still savour the warmth of your flesh

The second knight has been exhumed
And there's nothing you can do
But lay and watch in agony
He feasts on you as he fed on me
