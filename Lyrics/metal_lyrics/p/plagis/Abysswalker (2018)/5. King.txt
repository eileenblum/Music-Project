Welcome!
To the kiln beyond the dying gate
Hallowed
By thy furnace

One last obstacle
You face and fight tonight
The King!

Alight
Face the blade
That spade
Alive in flame
For a thousand days

You rose!
Up against the fucking dragons
You brought!
Them down with your bolts of lightning
You thought!
You would be the one to save us
You lost!
Everything that you were!

The age of Fire
Prolonged in your veins
I'll be the one to link the first flame
To have the king slain!
