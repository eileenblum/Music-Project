Throw yourself
Into the gaze
Of eternal darkness

Be enriched
By the view
Of the abyss

Wear your mark
Grab your shield
Arm yourself in valour

Take a breath
Look down and don't submit
Submerge!

I wade through waist deep water
Rusting slowly and going insane
I rest by crackling fire
Cleaning blood from my armour again

I stare into the flickering darkness
Echoing the screaming of the end
I come to a realisation that I...
Am eternal
