I call upon the stars to light the sky
To shine in radiance
To Pierce through blackened night

I urge the Gods to spin the Earth
To pull clouds over my head
To give me peace I deserve

With my soul
Everlasting, heart's burning
I sign the pact
Everlasting, soul's yearning

I draw my lines in the sand
I seal the contract
With blood from my hands

I burn like embers
Then simply fade away
Your grace, your touch
To you, I'm adored

My grave, my love, my soul
Toys in the hands of a king
My heart's bleeding for you
I'll sacrifice everything

My lifeline
That fuels my being
It will burn through the night
And rise up!

I let it wash it wash away
I can't control myself
I feel the ether
I know the strain
But for you my love
I'll give you everything

[Translated Polish to English:
"Every day I give to you
Sun
Moon
My heart is yours"]

I'll tear through the cosmos
I'll pierce the skin of God and Man
I'll be the beacon
I'll light the way

It's time
I, I will light the darkness consumed
I will be the vessel of burning
To destroy the Gods in your name

You will become complete.
