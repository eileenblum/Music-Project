Death will take us 
It will take me 
Fallen kingdoms 
All I see 

Nothing will be left of you 

We're all dead 
By our own hand 
No way out 
Accept the fate 

We are ready 
Take it away! 

We're all corpses 
We're already dead 
We're all corpses 
We're already dead 

No future 
For us now!
