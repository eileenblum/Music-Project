Since dawn of time the fate of man is that of lice 
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes 
A day of reckoning when penance is to burn 
Count down together now and say the words that you will learn 

Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 
Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero

Crestfallen kings and queens comforting in their faith 
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the wraith 
Since fate of man is equal to the fate of lice 
As new dawn rises you shalt recognize now behold the Lord of flies 

Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 
Hail Satan 

He will tremble the nations 
Kingdoms to fall one by one 
Victim to fall for temptations 
A daughter to fall for a son 
The ancient serpent deceiver 
To masses standing in awe 
He will ascend to the heavens 
Above the stars of god 

Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 
Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero
