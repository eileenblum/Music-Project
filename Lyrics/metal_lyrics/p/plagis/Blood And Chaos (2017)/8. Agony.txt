New found fear 
Woke up today 
Sky burning eternally 
Takes all we hold dear 

I feel agony 
Everything ripped away 
Flames cast us in darkness 
As we are no longer free 

Enslaved in our mind 
Whipped by the hand of regret 
Failure 
Disease 

A new found fear 
Agony 
As the sky burns away 
So must we
