I call upon the rolling thunder 
To split the skies and minds wide 
And the ignorant sea descends down 
And from the meadows grows truth 
And prosperity of the darkness 

The flames are reaching higher 
Like Lazarus rising from the deep 
Embracing us in black and smoke 
Praise the sulfur it brings 
Carrying the light that binds 

Blood and chaos embrace us 
Burning the unclean away 
To expose the heart to Satan 
And empty the minds of deceit 
To open the doors to burning Eden 

Blood and Chaos! 
Blood and Satan! 
Blood and Satan!
