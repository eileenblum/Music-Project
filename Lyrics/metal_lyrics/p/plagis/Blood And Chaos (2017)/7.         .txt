[originally by Rotting Christ]â¦ And the seven angels trumpeted 
And hailstorm could be seen â Înd fire mingled in blood 
And one third of the earthâs trees â Î¤he leaves of the bushes were burned down 

And the second one trumpeted â The burning mountain was shot at 
And the third of the buildings that lay in the sea passed away 
Holy Gaia 
Third angel trumpets â Î burning star fell 
Unto the springs of the waters â Înd the people perished 

Fourth angel trumpeted â Îne third of the sun was afflicted 
And a voice was heard â Î great blight will befall us 
Holy Gaia 
Fifth angel trumpeted â Înd there he came out of the smoke 
Pain, death he spreads â Î¤hose who do not have the mark 

Sixth angel trumpeted â Unleashing angels upon Euphrates 
And the seventh appeared â Humankind was put to death 
Holy Gaia 

Herein lies the Wisdom 
Let him who mind possesses vote the number of the beast 
Because itâs the number of man 
And his number is Î§ Î Î£
