It seems no matter what
It ends up this way
People locked in battle
Left to die and decay

Fighting with the fever
Fighting through the rot
Fighting throughout their lives
History forgot

You can take your star signs
You can torch your prayers
You can melt your idols
To rise above your fears

You can meld your hatred
You can take your rage
You can raise your sword high
You can take their name!

Blood for Blood
Feed the obsession
Rise among the ranks
of demonic possession

You fight
You slay
You waste all in your way
All to bring down the sun

You can take your star signs
You can torch your prayers
You can melt your idols
To rise above your fears

You can meld your hatred
You can take your rage
You can raise your sword high
You can take their name!
