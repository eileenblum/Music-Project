Hang them High
Hang them High
With their weapons drawn!

Captured now lifeless
Necks tied around a rope
Kicking the footing out under you

Kicking and screaming
The life drains from your eyes
As I watch you choke

Oh you have done it now
You beg 'Please untie us' among the roots
Hahaha, You'll see no more
When we slay you!

Now!
Signal the firing Squad!
Now!
Fire at will!

Fire at their throats!
Aim into their bodies
Then shoot their heads!

Let them die!
Raise them up!
Let them be seen
For the evils they have done

Hang them High
Let them die
On display
Hang them up!

Now!

Put them in the graves in which they'll die in
Twitching in the pool of blood they'll lie in
Oxygen supply's becoming thin
Losing a battle you would never win!

Signal the firing squad
Fire at will!

Dismember!

Hang them High!
