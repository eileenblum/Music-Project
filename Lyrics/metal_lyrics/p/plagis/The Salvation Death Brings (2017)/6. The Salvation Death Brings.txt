All the pain and misery
Inflicted on the world
All the agony and time
That we have beheld

Disease and suffering
A fate all too real
This endless fucking war
Bullets fired from steel

I'll spread more and gore
Than the cowards of war
Through this pain and onslaught I adore
I once did say, that in the ruins of day
The towers will fall and enslave us all!

It's salvation
The salvation death brings
An end to all pain
And endless suffering

It's salvation
The salvation death brings
A guiding hand towards the light
The eternal rest, and no more war!

Wake me from these nightmares
Cure me of my sickness
Help me breathe right
Just one more time

Heal me from my wounds
Clear my skin of scars
Set me free, and break my chains

It's salvation
The salvation death brings
An end to all pain
And endless suffering

It's salvation
The salvation death brings
A guiding hand towards the light
The eternal rest, and no more war!
