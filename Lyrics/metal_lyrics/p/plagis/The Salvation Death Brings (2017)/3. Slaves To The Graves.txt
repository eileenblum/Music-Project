Drop down to the floor
Face into the ground
Hear the loading of my pistol
Fear the firing sound

Twitching fear washes over you
And there's nothing you can do
There are still two left alive
Who dies next? You chose!

You want to kill youself
We refuse you the right
You die when we saw you day
And dig into the night

At last in the dead of night
Three of us get to see some fight
From a slumbered state you rise
And stare back into our cold dead eyes

You smile but struggle to load the gun
We watch you fail
Come on, kill us you coward!

You aim at me
Blood running down your face

You struggle. You stagger. You miss.

Fall into your grave
The one you dug your own
From now until the end of time
This shallow hole your home

And to the end of time
From the end of time
A slave into your grave!

Until the end of time
Submit now

So fucking die
So fucking die
Fucking die!
Fucking die!
