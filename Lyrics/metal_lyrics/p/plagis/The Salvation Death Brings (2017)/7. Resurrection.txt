You should have killed me
When you had the chance
And now you're all gonna die

As I awake infueled with rage
Your flesh I'll pray

From your Bones

I'll take your teeth and end your life

From your Skull

I'll eat your brain
And you will know me as a God

You try to run and It makes me laugh
You really think you'll get away
I watch you stagger and It gives me joy
To know it's you I'll slay

I'll take your eyes out from your head
I'll crush your skull underneath my boot
I'll drink your blood
and consume your flesh
You'll know me as a God
