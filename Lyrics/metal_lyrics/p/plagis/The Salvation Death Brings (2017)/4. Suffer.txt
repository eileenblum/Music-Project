I bring death and now you suffer
I bring fire from the depths of Hell
I link the flames and that will torch you
I bring destruction in my wake

I am the being between man and God
I am born of the seventh seal
I stand immortal beneath the earth
I am an entity that will never die

I find it amusing how I tear you down
and walk through your battlefield
I derive pleasure from seeing you suffer
as I hang your head on spikes

You think you'll be freed
You think you'll be saved
Just remember the slaves in their graves

I am a tribute to the war
That's been raged
You will remember my name

Boots, Bullets and Blood
The currency of fools
As I collect your scalps for decoration

I consume your putrid remains
And I take your medals
For my shiny collection

I prop your bones
Out as an offering
To he who rule over all
I make to you, a simple declaration
I am the bringer of death and pain

I am the king slayer
I commit regicide
I am the God slayer
I commit Deicide

I stand among the Gods!
I am slayer of the Gods!
I am the eater of the Gods!
I'll become a God!
