My broken body
To come and rot with me
Set to rive in eternal flame

I met the devil and he told me
'Do not bow, do not believe!'
I was granted a vicious life

And the sky came down
Tore the life from my world
I now dwell through hatred
Blood rushing from my veins

And their torches up in arms
Strung me up on their cross
Now I bleed out and die

Hell, I'm in Hell
Paralysing pentagrams!
Hell, burns like Hell!
Now I suffer as my skin melts

Sky of black
Burning in an eternal fire
Hell!

My time dwelling among the worms
Feast upon my flesh
Give me what I've earned
That's now my life
I'm living in a box

My coffin where I'll live forever!
Clinging to what I am
A being of pure hatred
Born of the pentagram

I do not bow!
I don't believe
I will not bow!
But I will burn!
