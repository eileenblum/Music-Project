And as I scream
I look to the skies
where I'm swallowed up the rising tides

And as I look
They gouge out my eyes
The sun burns brightly
and now thou art blind

And as I beg
I cry and wait
At my knees
I befall to the gates

It was my time
It was my fate
And before Satan's wrath, I lie and wait

To my behest
Lucifer gives me life and help me to stand
My bones reassemble
My life's in his hands

And as I scream
The pain surely stops
I'm resurrected by the slayer of Gods

And now I know what I'll do
I'll make people listen to what's evil but true
Their Bibles, their cross and their God
I'll burn it all!

In past times
I was send there to die
Hung up on their cross

And now I
With new purpose in life
Will bring about the reckoning
In the name of my lord
Hail Satan!
