Satan, Satan... watching from your tower 
Weakened fallen, broken, I see! 
Broken men! Fallen! You have no power! 

And they'll die, and they'll die! 
And they'll all fucking die! 
You cowards you hide! 
You watch them all die! 

Death on the fields, 
You watched them die 
You watched them all fucking die! 

Cowards of war 
Hide no more 
I'll slay you all 
And to me, you shall fall!
