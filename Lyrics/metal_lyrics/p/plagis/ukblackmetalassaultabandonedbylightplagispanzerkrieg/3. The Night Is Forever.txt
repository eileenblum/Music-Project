You see me now
A specter
A shadow
Of an angel now fallen

I haunt the living plain
Neither live or dead
From a land in between
Where its forever cold

The night is forever
The night is still young
The bells forever ring
Descent has only begun

The night is still living
The night is still young
Iâm most complete
Yet so undone!

Count me in with an evil smile
Walk upon my grave
Take refuge in my place of mourning
Hallowed by my name

Curse upon my grave
Curse!
I cannot be saved
Me!
Redemption is my place
Curse!
As blood runs down my face

The night is forever
The night is still young
The bells forever ring
Descent has only begun

The night is still living
The night is still young
Iâm most complete
Yet so undone!

Yet the clock strike 12
As the vermin dwells
And world erupts in the pits of Hell
Buildings crumble
People yell
Reeking of that awful smell

As time turns to cinder
All ends now
Theyâll simply beg and wonder how
They came and put you in your place
The shadows they dwell, the outer race

Fear not demons
From ground not sky
Death from below not on high
Bells chiming as chaos impounds
Before that old, wicked droning sound

The night is forever
The night is still young
The bells forever ring
Descent has only begun

The night is still living
The night is still young
Iâm most complete
Yet so undone!
