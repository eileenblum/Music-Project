I arise at the call of my name
I answer my victims dreams
They call me to take away their pain
I do just what they say

Let me in I'm your friend
My untruthful word works again
I'm the fear of what they dread
So now they'll sleep like a dead

Conjure me and there I'll be
To take your life to join with me
Forgive me not you have lost
That's the price a deadly cost

Loss of life now your mine
You thought your life was so divine
Temptation strong you had to fall
To your knees to me you crawl

Conjure me and there I'll be
To take your life to join with me
Forgive me not you have lost
That's the price a deadly cost

I will save you from this world
Nothing stops me they'll follow now
Power so great inside of me
Let them learn let them see
Scramble their brains now in control
Take their lives that's the toll

Go in search of life content rising high
The pleasure flow sweet pain is all they'll know
Storage of their brain their power you obtain

Put to sleep by me corpse is rotting well
Now you will see our kind will always dwell
Find are way is best well never go down
Put you down to rest upon your head I pound
