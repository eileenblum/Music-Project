Dark world set upon me
My own dream of fantasy and what to be
Control the dead and the earth a new rebirth
Strucken by this feeling a different light I'm seeing

Walk into my path and you will see
The living dead and what you'll be
Come forth and drain your life into me
Forever you'll live in ecstacy

Blood flows through my veins
Makes its evil stains no good remains
Feel the suction of my teeth deep underneath
And all the pain that you feel you bare to reveal

Walk into my path and you will see
The living dead and what you'll be
Come forth and drain your life into me
Forever you'll live in ecstacy

Dance among the dead when your with me
Your heart suddenly stops from the sight your see
Decrepit old bones from their graves stand tall
Mauling at your neck as your take a falll

Awaken at last now with the dead
Searching for blood in the deepest red
Sucking it down with nastily needs
Loving the blood the blood that feeds

Dance among the dead when your with me
Your heart suddenly stops from the sight your see
Decrepit old bones from their graves stand tall
Mauling at your neck as your take a falll

Walk into my path and you will see
The living dead and what you'll be
Come forth and drain your life into me
Forever you'll live in ecstacy
