The dreaded party begins
To test your faith in them
You drink the horrid solution
Coughing up blood and phlegm

Your body intestines start to decay
The bones of your body are blackened
Your heart emerges up to your throat
As your flesh begins to cracken

The burning sensation you love to feel
Controls your mind crazy but real
Permissive ways no longer exist
Forcing its way you can't resist

Wretched pain flows the body
Open sores now infected
Pain so great you can't refuse
Germs are now infested

Arthritis sets in the bones
Now clipped for life
You want to end it now
Stop this horrid strife
