Arise to the palace for now it wakes
Opening its doors it now awaits
Figures of dead summoned from the past
Haunting your soul will you die at last

Living in anguish living in pain
Now it has your life you no longer maintain
Consumption of blood for it will devour
Leaving you dead and it all the power

Dripping the walls red flowing free
Hunger for more is all that you'll see
Temptation divine pulling in more
Morbid the torture that's all your here for

Wrenching and whining for help to be near
No one comes in the palace they fear
Soon to be taken to worlds of unknown
Waiting the moment until it is shown

Twisting and turning through rancid descent
Visions of creatures grow strong
Ripping the skin clear off your body
How much more torture how long

Sucking and draining the palace of blood

Unbeatable creatures beholding their reign
Grasping your soul as they grow
Point of distinction is where you are now
Thrown in the void with the flow

Hidden in shadows to keep from denial
Opening eyes see victims arrival
Sensuous bodies to suck all but dry
Tears turn to blood as they cry
