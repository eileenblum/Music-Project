There's someone calling at my grave
I can't believe that I'm dead ...
And all these crimes, they haunt my sleep
And all the ones I took with me ...

They drag me out from my domains
My nestments were torn off my corpse
And in a chamber, now below ...
Of flesh and worms, I've built my throne!

Repent
It's time
Synod!
In pain ...
Deposed 
Abused
Possessed
In pain ...
