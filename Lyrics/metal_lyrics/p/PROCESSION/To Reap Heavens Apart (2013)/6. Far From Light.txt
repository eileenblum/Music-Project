And again with frozen eyes I draw the circle
And inside, the circle within
On a cane, the trembling of a thousand ages
To announce a painful release

And again in solitude I find the answers 
And again, the source lies within
Mesmerizend and tempted, I've crossed the centrum
As I wore the crown of rebirth

As sorrow's growing under
As shrouds of mist through snow
Far from light, I wonder
As stars just fade away

As loud the scream, a thunder
As strong in thousand prayers
Far from life, a wonder
One star denies its fate

And from the womb it crumbles
As for the tomb it craves
The void that made us stronger
When times of harvest came

A falling stream no rising
In distant seven grails
And far from light, no wonder
A conjurer in flames

No sealed the oath, in darkness
Detaching time and space
Far from life and boundless
From all desires and veils

Cause sorrow's growing unter 
While gathering the strength
And far from light, the somber
Still standing proud, unchained ...
