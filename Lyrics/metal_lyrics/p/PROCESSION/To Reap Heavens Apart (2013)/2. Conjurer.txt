Let me be the prayer
of the broken hands

The heartless betrayer
of the poisoned arms

I refuse to inhale
the scent that curses light
Let me breath as a stranger
while I close my eyes ...

Traceless pathways
A sanctuary
Embraced in darkness
I fade away

Conqueror of a thousand names
Conjurer, crowned in flames
