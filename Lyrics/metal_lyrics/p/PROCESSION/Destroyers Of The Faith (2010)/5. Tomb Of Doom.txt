Inside the circle now
You gave my soul
To seven sins in black
Admiring your cross...

Inside this holy ground
Temptation is pure
A naked figure cries
Tormenting the son

In seven sleepless nights
Oppressed by your mourn
In seven dreams in black
I praised the obscure...

Now all my demons dance
Obsessed by the curse
Denying the son

In harmony we cross the fire
A ceremony of sorrow
Over death's womb
Now take this oath, perpetual pyre
And underneath this ashes,
a Tomb of DOOM.
