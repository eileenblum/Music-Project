I Once saw them
Longing for the end
Dead men walking on these lands

Leave behind a life
Once lost by faith
On a hopeless world of worms

Followers!
Crawling disciples of doom
Sentinels!
On the road to the graves
Getting there
With chants and pagan dance
Oh!

You'll be buried soon
Don't be afraid
The Eternal Sleep of men

"Rest In Peace my son..."
The priest will say
As the blood of goat he tastes

Followers!
Crawling disciples of doom
Sentinel's!
In the garden of the graves
Celebrate!
With chants and pagan dance
Oh!
