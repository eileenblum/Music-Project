[Part I: The Loss]

"What have united us in joy,
Separates us in misery"

[Part II: Revenge]

Now I'm here all alone,
staring at your sacred grave
My dreams and my hopes...
They're all gone with your last breath

Not your voice or your laugh,
I will ever hear again
To watch you grow, becoming strong...
Is an honor I won't get

Oh my son, my dear son,
why your flesh and not mine?
Over your burial ground,
the promise of my mourning heart

I will ride against the cross
and their army of lies
Every drop of your blood
they will pay with their lives.

"Revenge shall be mine"
