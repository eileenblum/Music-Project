The reign of fear, dictators
Of absolute truth, deceiving
The ones that mourn, the blinded
In sacred trust...

They tie the fool, with serpents
Battalions of slaves, are rising
Declaring a war, against will
With sacred trust

They used to believe in a saviour
A prophet with tremendous grace
They worshipped his skull, full of maggots
They offered (opened) their bodies with faith

A temple of lust is their treasure
The ancient destroyers their name
Because, everything falls as they follow
Messiahs of poison and shame.
