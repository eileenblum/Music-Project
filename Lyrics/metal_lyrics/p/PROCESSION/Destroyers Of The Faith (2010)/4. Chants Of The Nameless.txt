Father, betrayer
Nameless, insidious
Mourner, destroyer
Patriarch of worms and rats

Mother, abortionist
Devoted, perverted
Sacred, hypocrite
Holy impious whore

When the time has come
I will summon you
Raise the precious crown

Every single chant
Every single prayer
Seven thousand tongues

On a grave-like throne
Ghosts and parasites
Point at me with cold dead eyes

My tongue a sword
My hands your tomb
I am damnation
I am ruin.
