I once saw them longing for the end
Lead men walking in these lands
Leave behind a life
Once lost by faith
In a hopeless world of worms

Followers!
Crawling disciples of doom
Sentinels!
On the road to the graves
Getting there
With chants and pagan dance!

You will be buried soon
Don't be afraid
The eternal sleep of men
Rest in peace, my son
The priest will say
As the blood of the goat he tastes

Followers!
Crawling disciples of doom
Sentinels!
In the garden of the graves
Celebrate!
With chants and pagan dance!
