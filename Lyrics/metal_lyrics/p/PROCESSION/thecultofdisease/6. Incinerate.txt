To walk the earth
Spreading words of mercy
You are not wise enough
To speak like a preacher

You knocked at my door
You asked me to hear you
What a waste of time
You are a poor little man

Surrender to myself
Your lies now you will pay
Hanging from your cross

There is one more thing to do
I am gonna make you burn
(With the) tongues of Lucifer

Burn!
