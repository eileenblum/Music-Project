Black Messiah flying higher
Spread your words
For the wicked they are chosen
To hold the Crown of Penance
Your arrival is a blessing, I won't forget
Thousand ages of survival
To die oppressed by guilt

Your existence is not holy, you are Satan's child
We have taken death commandments
In sorrows name
Sacrilege through solemn spellbound
We congregate
Black Messiah! Your death desire
We shall serve as will!

Raise the chalice of disease
Summon the bringer of the pest

With the ancient rite of Plague
Comes the tragedy of the earth
As the funeral of an age
Comes the tragedy of the earth

Raise the chalice of disease
Summon the bringer of the pest
Be welcome, Raven of disease
Open the kingdom of the dead
