Feel the pressure
Down the river of corpses
The slaves of a kingdom destroyed

The bodies are floating
The blackwater is drowning
The dreams of the ones who return

No one can see this
But me, I am dying
These waters are ripping my flesh

The Ocean awaits me
My season is fading
Farewell to the ones I will forget
