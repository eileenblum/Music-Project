Thereâs someone calling at my grave
I canât believe that Iâm deadâ¦
And all these crimes, they haunt my sleep
And all the ones I took with meâ¦

They drag me out from my domains
My vestments were torn off my corpse
And in a chamber now, belowâ¦
Of flesh and worms, Iâve built my throne!

Repent
Itâs time
Synod!
In painâ¦

Repent
Itâs time
Synod!
In painâ¦

Deposed
Abused
Possessed!
In painâ¦
