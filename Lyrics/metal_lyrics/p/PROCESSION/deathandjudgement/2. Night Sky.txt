[originally by Scald]Will of the Gods is great power

Night sky on your
Boundless distances
Spill great number of stars
They twinkle creating a unique stars world

Craving of cognition
Is great and fervent
Gods create the miracle
Itâs not subject to consciousness

Eternal beauty
Will of the Gods is great power

Morning stars with sunrise
You sailed away into the abyss of sky
The light hided you
Unknown mysteries of a distant world

Leaving night
Take away stars world
A moon light gone out
Only morning stars are still visible

Eternal beauty
Will of the Gods is great power

Morning stars with sunrise
You sailed away into the abyss of sky
The light hided you
Unknown mysteries of a distant world
