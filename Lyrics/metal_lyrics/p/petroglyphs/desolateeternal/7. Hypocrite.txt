Go
You turned your back on me
You see an anchor in me
I don't want to hold you back
Despite my own intentions
I know that this wont last
After all this time alone
I know that you'll bring me off my knees
Now that I've opened my eyes
I can finally see what you truly meant to me
What you meant to me
After all this time alone i finally got it figured out
Now that I've opened my eyes
I know that you were never meant for me
Being pulled in every direction
Arms reaching out
Despite my best intentions
I am meant to find my own way out
And all the countless time i heard you through
Its time for me to turn my back on you
You fucking hypocrite
After all this time alone
I know that you'll bring me off my knees
Now that I've opened my eyes
I can finally see what you truly meant to me
Just set me free
You see an anchor in me
I don't want to hold you back
