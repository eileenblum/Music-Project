As I leave this desolate place, in hopes to find myself. in my dreams. I will never lose sight of the way things used to be, in spite the fact is I must move on.
led by the system meant to prevail, our creators deserted us and left us to fail.
This path, torn roads before me. A figure in the distance leads me to the light.
An overwhelming sense of nostalgia crept over me, but do I dare to leave?
It says to me without a sound to be heard, "You can not control the world.but we can guide you intelligently. "
It's up to you to believe in your dreams.
Falling through these ripples in time, these worlds arent so distant after all.
I am nearing the depths of the end, I am awake, I am awake.
