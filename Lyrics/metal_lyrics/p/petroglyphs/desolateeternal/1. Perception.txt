The carvings on these walls. Buried beneath the earth have held the truth. The answers were always there, can't you see? This is eternal.

You were given the tools it's up for you to decide.
We're not from this place, we are simply left behind.
Its your choice to believe, and a gift to perceive.

Given no choice, this was their plan from the start .our beginning is just a fabrication of our flaws. Have we broke alignment with the Stars?

It's not dementia, just a higher level of consciousness.
An outside view of a former life, is a dream we all share when we sleep at night.
I can hear them calling.
I am aware of my beginning....

....Perception!

Through the pages mounted in stone, I am oblivious to the tales .....
