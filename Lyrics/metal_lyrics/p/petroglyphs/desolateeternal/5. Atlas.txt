I am the navigator
Cast away for my mistakes
Banished never to return
This was the place that I called home
I have wasted so much time
Daydreaming about our next step in life
When I made the ultimate sacrifice
I knew what I was leaving behind
I am the navigator
Cast away from my mistakes
Condemned to exile
We are abolished from this place
(You held the world but who is holding you)
We are stranded
This void leads us nowhere
They are restricted from time and space
They will never See us for who we are
Nor will we ever
See them for the progress that they've made
Is this all that I have
Is this all that I have left
All alone with death breathing down my neck
I tried to help you I tried to save the world
But you pushed me away into this bitter cold
And the last glimpse that I caught
Was a silhouette of a sphere
As the stars aligned
It eclipses all light from the earth
I watched them disappear
I watched you disappear
