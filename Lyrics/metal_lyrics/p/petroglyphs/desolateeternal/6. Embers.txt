If I don't do this for myself
I'll become the man that I never wanted to be
These were my virtues
These are my beliefs
I need to cast them aside
And make something of my dreams
I will show you
I will leave you all behind
I will give this my all
I will make it count
I won't be an anchor
I'll carry my own weight
I will follow the sunrise
I will leave you behind
Because this is the only chance
I had to make something of my life
Here I am drenched in fear
I should've stayed where my path was so clear
Embrace
You must accept what you've done
This is not the end
You've only scratched the surface
As the seas begin to tremble
And the ways turn black
I have put the fear of the ancient ones in their eyes
My missions complete
But at what cost I have given up on any hope that I had in you
One day you will all be forgotten
And what will make of you
Then a new king will rise from the embers
And we will all fade away
This was the ugly truth that I tried to hide from you
And tonight I'm leaving you behind; humankind
