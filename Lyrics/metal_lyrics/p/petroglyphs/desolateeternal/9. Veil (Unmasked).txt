a light, glimmers in the distance.
like burning embers of thought connecting in his mind.
the veil has covered his eyes, for quite some time.
his soul is painted white, empty of existence.

but theres a new hope,
something to fill the void that has been missing.
he let go for the first time, and its the first time.
he felt free.
