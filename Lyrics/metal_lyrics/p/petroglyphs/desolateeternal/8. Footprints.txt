We have been searching for lost ground
To find our footsteps
That were forgotten through time
But the only channels that I find
Are the moments aligned with you
I never been down a narrow road
Not one like this
That's so dark and cold
Nobody understands
Nobody takes the time for a second
See through obsidian eyes
For what it's worth
You'll move on to better days
And you still have time to grow
If you change your fucking ways
Without saying goodbye
I have accepted fate
And you'll never know that you were my creation
As I rise from the clouds
I see what the world has become in life
In death we fall victim to the same thing; pain
I will never stop searching
I won't give up
I've let myself sink for the last time
