I've been searching for something more, an undying hunger for me to explore. The purpose of such a broad existence.
This journey will go on no matter how relentless.
I'll never know if I never try to uncover the truth underneath what lies.
Lurking through eternal consciousness
This discovery could be infinite.

How can I
Comprehend what most can't fathom
A void finally filled by the words I gathered
This life can't be explained on paper, I'll rise up and be my own creator

I will forever seek my true north overstepping the boundaries set forth. Ã2
I'll never limit my expressions, for others lack of acceptance.

How can I
Comprehend what most can't fathom.
I'll never limit my expressions, for your lack acceptance

I will forever keep rising and create my own existence
I will create my own existence
