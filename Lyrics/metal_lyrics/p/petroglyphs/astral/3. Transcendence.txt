My failures have not been burdens
In your so called luxurious life
So why burden me with your ignorant mind?
I have sacrificed So much to live for my dreams
So why label me when we're both on different paths to success?

We can be reprogrammed (it doesn't have to be this way)
You can achieve greatness
You just have to believe in something

In hindsight I lost my way
There was never really a path just a sustainable faith
In hindsight I lost my way
It haunts me, how things couldn't stay

Breaking free of regulated beliefs
Your inescapable fate will not be my destiny

A suitable script For the common man
I'll tear down barriers before me

And for this, I'll be shamed forever.
But only in the eyes of those who gave up on their dreams

Wash away [2x]
All of your past mistakes
I'm taking back the shame you put on me.

I'm taking back what I once stood for, and I'll be cemented to this place. And I'll become what it means to be alive

Wash away [2x]
All of your past mistakes
