I can feel a change in the air
An effervescent perception caused by despair
My cognition undergoes deviation
Just a figment of my imagination

A change of season is upon us
I can't see the horizon
As we depart from the hands of a dimension
Nothing, to keep us stable
Nothing, to hold us down
Nothing, to make us lucid
We are fucking weightless

As my gaze is averted
I stare into oblivion
I reminisce of a time that no longer exists
Are deserted forever?
Forced into solitude
Will we ever reach our destination?

I have arrived
Floating into oblivion

I have reached my final stasis
I am, the end
