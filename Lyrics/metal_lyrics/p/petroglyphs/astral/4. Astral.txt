I ascend to a higher realm
Consciousness has escaped me
Separation from my body
A new world unveiled
A new world revealed
Grasped by a seditious presence
I know I am not alone
A new world unveiled
I see the light pass through me
Neurological mutation
Distorting my thoughts
Like a pathogen
This is the point where I lose my composure
Am I free?
This is the start of my expedition
An opportunity to further myself from the disaster I've become
Disaster I've become
My manifestation has reached its summit

Regaining consciousness
Will I ever be the same?
Is this substance to blame?
Is this substance to blame?
This must be
Who I really am
Will I ever be free?
Will I ever be free?
