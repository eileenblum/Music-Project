Where did you go, you left this world with a broken soul. The void in my chest is nothing but a vacant hole.

The truth is, you cared too much. I tried my hardest but love was never enough.
Overwhelmed by constant sorrow,
I know these feelings may be harder to swallow.
Force fed perpetual falsification
Deceit has embodied this situation, we have lost life's most beautiful creation

I never wanted to let you go.... but could you let me know, when you look down below.
Does it feel celestial?

Where did you go, you left this world with a broken soul. This void in my chest is nothing but a vacant hole.

And the flowers will continue to grow, along with the void in my chest.

These memories will never fade.
Just like the etchings on an early grave, on your headstone these words resonate, they resonate
