Yeah, you know the beat 250 
They say you dudes is dead, but we keep it filthy 
You on the internet talkin' shit, you're creepy 
'Cause we the motherfuckers that you wish you could be 

And we ain't ever gonna stop, 
Hoes sit on my face and on my crotch, then wash my socks 
And I'm fox on the hunt for some box 

Bad bitches in high tops wearing my band shirt, take off your damn skirt 
Hang around me for too long, you run the risk of getting burnt 
Like a dab hit, speaking my mind over some odd-time slam shit 
Handle it 
She loves the dick 
You'll get slapped mad quick for talking shit 
Your pride is gone and now you're left for dead
