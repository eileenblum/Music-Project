Corrupt, what have we let them do? They tore our world into pieces 
Corrupt, was the cause of the wicked 
They will be put to death for their treason in the name of mankind 
Down falls the hammer 
You can't but your way out of this one 
You can't buy your way 
You can't buy your way 
You cannot buy your way! 

Damned to meet the mask 
The guillotine descends as we all stand behind the glass 
Our tears of anguish have run dry 

Let go of the life you thought you knew and let the hate run through your veins 
This is the last time they let us down 
Breaking the chains that once had our hands shackled and bound 

At last, the heroes of the overturn will now be immortalized 
Tears of anguish have run dry 

Blackened skies 
Open eyes 
Time to rise to our feet again! 

Let go of the life you thought you knew and let the hate run through your veins 
This is the last time they let us down 
Breaking the chains that once had our hands shackled and bound 

Black flags by the will of the masses and now will turn to ash 

Ironically, what have we become? We tore our world into pieces
Unjust was the cause of the wicked 
But our greed has destroyed us and crippled all of mankind 
Down falls the hammer 
We can't buy our way out of this one 
We can't buy our way 
We can't buy our way 
We can't buy our way out! 

Falling easily, knocking down your house of cards 
Simple, it is to turn on your brother 
We defile ourselves with greed 
We defile ourselves with greed
