Welcome one and come all â our show has just begun! 
A masquerade, comprised of the shunned of humanity 
My fortune's a faint glimpse into my horrific act 

Crowds stare in awe 
What a jaw-dropping display 
Mental acrobatics that leads their minds astray 
Welcome one and all, to the show that's now your home 
The lights go dark and all eyes are fixed on you 

Watching the curtains come down, please take your seats 
You're seeing things that you can't believe 
You want to leave, but you have already become a part of the black bazaar 

Mothers and fathers scream at the sight of the hollowed out eyes of their young 
It's too late, can't change your fate 
A grotesque attraction you cannot and won't ever escape 

Running for my life from the elephants 
The elephants of the black bazaar 
Running for my life from the circus lions 
I see my death in the hungry beast's eyes 

Watching the curtains come down, please take your seats 
You're seeing things that you can't believe 
You want to leave, but you have already become a part of the black bazaar 
Upon the stage, 'till the end of days 
They take your life, but that alone is not enough 
Flesh rots away, we're face to face with death, but he turns away 

The sun sets, we're lifeless 
Not a soul is at rest 
We are condemned and possessed 
There's no beating heart in this chest 
Watching the curtains come down, please take your seats 
You're seeing things that you can't believe 
You want to leave, but you have already become a permanent part of us 

We are now lost, our future is bleak 
They cut out your tongue and force you to speak 
The lies we've been fed are the sins we now reap 
Welcome one and come all, please take your seats
