There is a tyrant within 
Concealed by our skull 
Constantly fixated 
Duality in its distress 

Here I face the voice, a voice that's not my own 
Am I alone? 

Are we the same? 
Confined by internal judgment 
Were we always the same? 

The obsession in this disrupted mind on the edge of control 
Has now come to reign 
Inner turmoil 

The absence of virtue is now claimed by despair 

The tyrant confined in my mind 
Lures us to live life in rewind 
A voice divided from inside 
Inside 

(We are one) 

Push me over the edge so that we can collapse into its depths 
Never to engage what the world has 
Never to engage the world inside this mind 
Inside this mind 

In the absence of virtue now claimed by despair 
Gives way to this creation 

Free me 
Sever the voice of the tyrant 
(There is a tyrant within) 
Lures me deeper inside 

Is this our end as I know it? 
Are we the same? 

Mend the separation between control and submission 
Here I face this voice that's not my own 

Are we the same? 
Sever the voice from its source 
Mute the relentless screams 
Sever the voice from its source 

This is the end as we've known it 
Because we're the same 

The presence of virtue 
Unearthed by suffering 

The tyrant defined by my mind 
Lures to live life in rewind 
Upon reflection now I know that we are one 
We are one! 

And now we're the same 
And now we're the same 
We're the same 
And now we're the same.
