Tumbling stars fall down 
Punishment from the heavens 
They tear holes into the fabric of our existence 
As the energies of other dimensions creep in 

Oceans dry as the bones that litter our cities 
Still my mind dreams of you 
Spinning like the sands that have eroded our lives 
Can you grant me my one last wish? 

Everyone we know is dead and buried 
For one thousand years I travel the stars 
Searching for something 
Something that I will probably never find 

One million years trapped inside one soul 
Infinite systems crash and spin out of control 

Living in a wake of sorrow 
I forever roam in this endless sea of my inner emotions 
It is hard to tell, but from what I know, one day we will be whole again 

Jupiter has come to swallow us 
Be not be frightened, this was all foretold in our blood 
But we were blinded by love (of ourselves) 

Everyone we know is dead and buried 
For one thousand years I travel the stars 
Searching for something 
Something that I will probably never find 

Jupiter has come to swallow us 
Be not be frightened, this was foretold in our blood 
But we were blinded by love (of ourselves) 
The sun expands scorching all she knows 
Sterilized by the mother I was made 
Temping time to remain a rock in forever drift 

Everyone we know 
Everyone we know 
Everyone we know 

Everyone that we know is dead
