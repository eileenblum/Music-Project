These people waiting for something that will never come 
These people paying for nothing with their sweat and blood 
My keeper, the man who spits lies straight to my face as they feast on their strife 
The light in my eyes tells me that that must be a better place than this, but now I cannot leave 
They expect me to stay just for their faith 
This act of betrayal to myself is a choice that I have to make 

I've been waiting a long time for this holding it in for years 
But I must do this for myself and to let you know 
That something else exist than the life you knew 
Together our eyes have shown us home 
We have no choice now 

Focusing on the pain of the punishment 
If they find us here it will be as if hell was sent 
To bring us back as slaves to the offering 
I'd rather die than utter the words "I repent" 
I hope you can accept this life you must live 
'Till we are old running from memories that we are trying to rid 
BETRAYER is the name that we now bare 
If time catches us, our hearts will be one in the depths of the crypts 
A millennium past the peace shattered by unholy chants 
Taken our souls from the gates to be brought to the darkest of hands
