Nocturne's trance
Glares of magic are direction
The look of the unknown eye
There is a movement on the evil's wall

I'm holding up my hands
The look of horror
The will of thoughts
Blood getting thicker
Body is shaking

I am the Wizard myself!

Entities from the Astral
Keeping by me
There is an anger in their eyes
Souls from dark Spheres, from beyond...

Their eyesight is in mysterious space
Thoughts will fill up
In the Hall they rule
Under the influence of Saturn
I have just said what I want

Baphomet
