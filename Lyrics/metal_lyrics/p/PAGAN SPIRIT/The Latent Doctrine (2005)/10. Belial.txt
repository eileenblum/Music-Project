Decisions determined by own course
Felt a long time ago
Naturality is shapeless and so clean
The Archont of the Earth, mighty Belial

Influential implementation's power of confusion
And disharmonies
Lead us one by one, us all
If it isn't fated grass to grow
So, it didn't grow there before

The birth of Darkness
Where are the most beautiful castles
One rock will tear anothers away
And it will move forward the own possibilities...

Belial is the inside of changeable Earth
Belial is the wind that moves

We have to keep the evokation intact
For Him, who move with the scenes of History
