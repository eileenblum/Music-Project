Cold midnight sun above horizon of Northeern Nature
Is in activity
Whirlrd dazzled snow blown by cruel wind
Voices of old pagan forefathers
Gallop through the cold country

Midnight Mountains majesty of the No Defeats
Appeared out from the fog of Darkness
Midnight Mountains, the seat of mighty slavonic Gods

By the rumble of strong unchained winds
Are our hearts carring away,
The Will merge into chilly stones
Respected through centuries Perun, Stribog, Veles
Are there still alive

Midnight Mountains majesty of the No Defeats
Appeared out from the fog of Darkness
Midnight Mountains, the seat of mighty slavonic Gods

Where are Midnight Mountains
There the wind don't quieten down
Where are Midnight Mountains
There is eternal frost
