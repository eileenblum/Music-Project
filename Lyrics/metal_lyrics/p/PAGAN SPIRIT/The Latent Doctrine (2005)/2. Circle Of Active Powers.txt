From big Palette of the Universe
One paint is running out
It dominates to the elemental Outer-Space
I got the hang of it!

Sexus actived his mighty black eye
Which was forming into the tops of
Pyramids in historical Ages

I aware!

I'm entering into the magical Circle...
Water is washing me away
And Undinies are singing their lullabies

I'm flying with the wind
And Sylfs are stretching their wings
I'm strolling on the Earth
And Gnoms are giving me their wisdom

And fire reproduced by Salamanders
Isn't burning me
They, they are inserting the might to execute
Into my hands
And powers,
Powers not perceived by berks
Are more than sure....!
