Composing here reflecting, of visions in my mind
Of dreams that haunt and angles tell of the things I left behind
And as the day ends and darkness sets on
I must release me to write my new song
Iâve had a good day good fortunes Iâve sown
The storm moving in is tomorrowâs unknown
But every cloud you see with its silver lining
Will open up and pour its rain on you
Those dreams that you have they will dissolve before your eyes
You need to take the thunder that cloud is making
And let it sound for youâ¦an eagle now
So open up your wings and fly the air into the skies
Soaring where eagles dare, looking down no more despair
Stare to the sky, I know who Iâm like
Cause Iâm soaring where eagles dare, soaring where eagles dare
Now deep in slumber my dreams consist of just bits and chunks
Of film and video, recordings of me I will never see
In the basement of mind
Free as an eagle Iâm flying higher exposing scenes of my serenity
Those dreams that I have will not dissolve before my eyes
Soaring where eagles dare, looking down no more despair
Stare to the sky, I know who Iâm like
Cause Iâm soaring where eagles dare, soaring where eagles dare
Composing here, reflecting, of visions in my mind
Of dreams that haunt and angles tell of the things I left behind
I left behind
