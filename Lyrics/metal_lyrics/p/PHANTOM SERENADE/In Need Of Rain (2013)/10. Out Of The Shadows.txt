Into the shadows
Back to the wall
The weight of the world is crushing
I pray for the strength to stand tall

After all the hurting is over
After the pain is gone
After the worst is behind us
Heâs still our God

Out of the shadows
Far from the wall
The weight of the world weâre holding
I prayed that we could take it all

After all our hurting is over
After our fear is gone
After the darkness is off us
Heâs still our God

Facing the challenge
Facing the fear
The demons that once haunted us
They will disappear
Under the spotlight
Burnt from the heat
The chromacolor brilliance will no longer blind us
Now we see it
Now we see it all

We march in victory
Touching the flame
Fighting the beast with the sword
He gave us in Jesus name
Hell ainât for heroes
We heed the call
Heaven is now upon us
Canât you him coming down to save us all

After all the hurting is over
After the pain is gone
After the worst is behind us
Heâs still our God
After all our hurting is over
After our fear is gone
After the darkness is off us
Heâs still our God
Heâs still our God
