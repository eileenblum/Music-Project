Seeing shadows on the wall, hearing voices in the night
Divination in a dream, left cold and without light
The bigger the lure the bigger the fish, cognitive blurring befalls
Remember the eyes that you canât see
Enlightened, the age of the fall
Amorphic anomaly, advanced ethereal insight
Prophetic paradox, left cold and without light
The bigger the lure the bigger the fish, cognitive blurring befalls
Remember the eyes that you canât see
Enlightened, the age of the fall
Fallen angels are not gods, theyâre but spirits unclean
Into the mouth of the beast,
Theyâre vanquished to the father of all lies
Malevolent empire, unseen in plain sight
With fists of green and sinister eyes
They laugh as they watch you die
The bigger the lure the bigger the fish, cognitive poisoning befalls
Remember the eyes that you canât seeâ¦enlightened
The bigger the lure the bigger the fish, cognitive poisoning befalls
Remember the eyes that you canât see
Enlightened, the age of the fall
