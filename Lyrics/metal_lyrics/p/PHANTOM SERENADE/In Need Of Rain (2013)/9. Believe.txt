When life gets rough and you know that it does from time to time
Can you deal with the fact that some days have no reason or rhyme
Do you know that someone can lift you back to your feet
After youâve been knocked down in defeat
Do you have the faith that moves the mountains
Do you have the hope that stays the fear
Do you have the love that lifts you higher
Do you have the peace to persevere
When times are bad and you know that they are from time to time
Can you still find the will to look at people in their eyes
Do you realize that someone out there cares for you
Even though you are not at your best weâve been there too
Do you have the faith that moves the mountains
Do you have the hope that stays the fear
Do you have the love that lifts you higher
Do you have the peace to persevere
When life is good will you still give thanks from time to time
To the one who made you built you up and gave you life
Do you know that someone out there wants you to achieve
Look beyond the day, be still and just believe
Do you have the faith that moves the mountains
Do you have the hope that stays the fear
Do you have the love that lifts you higher
Do you have the peace to persevere
