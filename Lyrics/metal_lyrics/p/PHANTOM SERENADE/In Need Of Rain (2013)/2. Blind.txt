If I never walked behind you then would I be blind
If I never looked upon you then Iâd be left behind
I could never be just like you itâs so easy to see
The devil surely cried the very moment Iâ¦
When I call you, you keep me with feet on the sea
When I ask you for some peace you grant me relief
If I never walked behind you then would I be blind
If I never looked upon you then Iâd be left behind
I could never be just like you itâs so easy to see
The devil surely cried the very moment Iâ¦
If I doubt you appear to me give me wings to fly
When I fail you please forgive me keep me alive
If I never walked behind you then would I be blind
If I never looked upon you then Iâd be left behind
I could never be just like you itâs so easy to see
The devil surely cried the very moment I believed
Should I beg you for a brand new creed
Will you break me so that Iâm down on my knees
If I never walked behind you then would I be blind
If I never looked upon you then Iâd be left behind
I could never be just like you itâs so easy to see
The devil surely cried the very moment I believed
