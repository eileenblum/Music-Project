The air stand still, the shade is hot
High above a cool cool shadow begins
But the clouds bring on this feeling that the rain coming in
Will not bring me the healing that I need today
Itâs just a passing moment anyway
Now blowing windsâ¦the tempest begins
But the clouds bring on this feeling that the rain coming in
Will not bring me the healing that I need today
Itâs just a passing moment anyway
Will my faith endure through this coming storm
Flashing bolts of light, day turns into night
A darkness that does not belong on me
Cyclonic arcade, phantom serenade
A darkness that does not belong on me
Twisting into form, from this coming storm
As thunder echoesâ¦horizons darkenâ¦
The air turns colderâ¦my senses sharpen
Thereâs no time for me to simply wait and see
As lightning strikes the ground from which I fled
Inundated swarm in this coming storm
As thunder echoesâ¦horizons darkenâ¦
The air turns colderâ¦my senses sharpen
Will I be transformed by this coming storm
As thunder echoesâ¦horizons darkenâ¦
The air turns colderâ¦my senses sharpen
Testing my faith, sent from Heavenâs gate
My cries are washed away upon the wind
The storm dissipates, light now emanates
The alluring light that I know belongs on me
This passing storm begged me to conform
But I knew that he was with me all along
