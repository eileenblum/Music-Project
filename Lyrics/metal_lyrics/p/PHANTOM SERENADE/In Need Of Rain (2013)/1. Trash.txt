Show me everything you got
And I tell you, baby itâs not a lot
Cause Iâm tired of what youâre playing
Iâm not listening anymore to that trash
Emotion is something that you forgot
Redemption forgive you I will not
Cause Iâm tired of what youâre playing
Iâm not listening anymore to that trash
Devour youâre eating at my brain
Youâre not in tune
Youâre driving me insane
Cause Iâm tired of what youâre playing
Not listening anymore
Sick of what youâre saying
Gonna walk right out the door
Tired of what youâre playing
Gonna throw it on the floor
Sick of what youâre saying
Iâm not listening anymore to that trash
