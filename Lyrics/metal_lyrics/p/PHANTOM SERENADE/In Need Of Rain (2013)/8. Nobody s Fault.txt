You see me and I see you, each one taking point of view
Out of touch weâre much the same, playing the blaming game
I donât hate you so donât hate me, we need to realize that it was
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we hurt each other but itâs really
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we realize itâs not our call
That sometimes people fall, and we see that it wasâ¦
You are you and we are we, not enjoying our company
Weâve drowned far too long to swim
Now exhausted weâre giving in
I donât hate you so donât hate me, we need to realize that it was
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we hurt each other but itâs really
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we realize itâs not our call
That sometimes people fall, and we see that it wasâ¦
I hurt you and you hurt me, now together we canât be
We are on the opposite side, so we run and hide
I donât hate you so donât hate me, we need to realize that it was
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we hurt each other but itâs really
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we realize itâs not our call
That sometimes people fall, and we see that it wasâ¦
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we hurt each other but itâs really
Nobodyâs faultâ¦we realize itâs not our call
That sometimes people fall, and we see that it wasâ¦
Sometimes people fall
