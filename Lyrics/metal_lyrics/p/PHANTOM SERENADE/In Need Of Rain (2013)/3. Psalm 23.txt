The Lord is my shepherd I lack nothing
He lets me rest in green meadows
He leads me beside the still waters
Refreshes my soul and guides me along the right path
For his names sake and righteousness
Even though I walk through the dark valley
The valley of the shadow of death
I will not fear for you are with me
No matter how dark
Youâre close behind me I know
For you will protect and comfort me
Thou preparest a table before me
In the presence of my enemies
My cup overfloweth with blessings
Goodness pursues me
All of the days of my life
And I will dwell eternally
