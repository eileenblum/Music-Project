Ruination
Wipe the whole slate clean
Ruination
This ruined nation

A nation of abominations,
Watching an empire end
Weâve set our sights on pure chaos
The void will welcome us again

We tried
We failed
In our darkest hour, we bailed

Ruination
This ruined nation

Last generation, an aberration
Watching the whole world burn
We have no mouths and we must scream
The void welcomes us again

We tried
We failed
In our darkest hour, we fucking bailed
