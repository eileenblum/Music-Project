Peace be unto thee, unless you want a piece of me
Whose side are you on?
You canât hide
You canât run
You wage war on life,
Logic lost in brainwashed minds
Storming heaven, itâs not too late
Hit them hard, crash the gates

I see your way of life and I think itâs a joke
âDonât step out of line, youâre walking a tight rope!â
Before long Iâll be dead and gone
Locked up for the firing squad

Old guard changes hands
This will be your last stand
You had yours
I want mine
Second chance: Denied

I see your way of life and I think itâs a joke
âDonât step out of line, youâre walking a tight rope!â
Before long youâll be dead and gone
Locked up for the firing squad

Warfare everywhere?
I shudder the thought!
Lined up with the firing squad,
Now take your best shot!
