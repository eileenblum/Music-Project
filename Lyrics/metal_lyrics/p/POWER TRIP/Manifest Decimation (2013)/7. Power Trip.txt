You want to double down? Well I'll break you twice.
Buy into the bullshit with your head as the price.
The system is broken what choice can you make?
Pick up a gun, or catch some fucking chains.

We ride as one,
We're ruled by none
As long as I'm free I'll live illegally,
Smoke and mirrors until they catch me.

We ride as one,
We're ruled by none,
Their lies, your life.
Your mind, not mine.

Earth's moral compass pointed south,
Forever broken, the good cast out,
Join or die; there is only two sides to take:
The rebel evil or the police state.

We ride as one,
We're ruled by none.
As long as I'm free I'll live illegally,
Smoke and mirrors until they catch me.

We ride as one,
We're ruled by none,
Their lies, your life.
Your mind, not mine.

Not mine

Perennial paranoia:
A paradox for every thought.
But the endless chase is better than being left to rot.

Pride and fear has brought us here,
A catalyst to an endless abyss.
Every toe-tag; a price tag.
I pledge deviance from under the flag.

Their lies, your life,
Your mind, not mine.
