So you think you're living outside the box?
You've got your head held high like you're reaching from something.
Talking like you've got it all figured out
As if the men before you have amounted to nothing.

Well I'll be the one who turns your purpose into pain.
Disrupt the balance; it's just an illusion anyway.
Doubt.

Wise to what faith has in store for you?
You are no different than all of the rest.
In the face of harsh reality,
I'll put your sanity to the test.

Well I'll be the one who turns your confidence into shame.
Failing from your pedestal; you only have yourself to blame.
Doubt.

On your path to progress, I'll be the only thing standing in your way.

Keep searching for the light,
Waste your life hunting something that you'll never find.
You want the absolute?
There's just one thing that you got to do.

You feel the barrel touch t front of your head.
You're taking your life in your hands.
And as the hammer strikes the pin,
Ask yourself,
"Is this
How
You thought
It would end?"

Doubt.

Cynic: A grim reality starts to unfold.
