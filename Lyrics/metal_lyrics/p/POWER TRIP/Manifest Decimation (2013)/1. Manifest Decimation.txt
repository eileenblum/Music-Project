Under the boot of great oppression we slither and crawl.
On the path for annihilation but in the name of god?
Manifest Decimation, we stumble and fall.
Manifest Decimation, to suppress us all.

Under the boot of great oppression, a dark figure conquers us.
Manifest Decimation, when all hope is crushed.

Crushed.
