[Music by Tom R. Piippo and Yngve Olsen, lyrics by Tom R. Piippo]

Close your eyes and fall asleep
Let your spirit fly
To the kingdom where your dreams are brought to life
Just reach out for the talisman
The bright light leads you home
Softly voices whispering your name

[Bridge 1:]
Now the crimson dawn is calling, it reflects in my eyes
And the other side is waiting
I want to cross the borderline

[Bridge 2:]
The dwarfs and the elves and the fairyqueen
will take you to a land that you've never seen
Through the golden gates of magic we will ride

[Chorus:]
Be the hero of the battlefield
and the keeper of the sacred shield
Your name will be remembered for all time
Join the treasure hunt to the dragon's den
Be a knight of the table round and then
the princess and the kingdom will be yours

Close your eyes and make a wish
See it all come true
Feel the power while it's floating through your veins
Drink the water from the fountain of youth
and you will never die
Immortal you will be forevermore

[Bridge 1]
[Bridge 2]
[Chorus]

Warriors in golden armour riding unicorns
Mighty eagles circle in the sky
Rainbow-coloured dragons with firebreath of death
Armies of the good and evil scream their battlecries

[Repeat of previous verse with extra vocals]
Warriors in golden armour riding unicorns
Mighty eagles circle in the sky
Rainbow-coloured dragons with firebreath of death
Armies of the good and evil scream their battlecries

[Bridge 2]
[Chorus]
