[Music and lyrics by Yngve Olsen and Jack R. Olsen]

[Intro:]
Guilty in blasphemy, well let me burn in hell
You know my story, I've fallen from glory
I am a priest with a riot in my heart
The words of heaven makes me furious

Where's my glory, where's my pride, where is my reward
In vain I fought the holy fight, but I never saw the light
God in heaven, I never felt your grace
Divine and empty promises, I feel I've been betrayed

I feel I've been betrayed

I've always been a faithful man, a guardian of the light
I called your name in my despair, but you never heard my prayers
Why must I bear the cross you gave
You say you really died for me, should I die for thee

Should I die for thee

[Bridge 1:]
And through the shadow-world I roam
Living in these ruins of my home

[Chorus:]
I am the lord of the shadow-world
I sacrificed my faith at the altar
I swore revenge with unholy vowes
The heavens shall fall, the angels will bleed to death

[Chorus]

I preach the word of your love, a hypocrite I am
Behind my mask of holiness you'll find an empty man
Deep inside me the hate is burning strong
In the church, late at night, I do what is right for me

I do what is right for me

All my deeds and all my sins, I never will repent
Now I belong to the shadow-world and my faith is at the end
When I die I'll never go to rest
I curse my spirit to this church, I'll never leave this earth

I'll never leave this earth

[Bridge 2:]
And from my death I will return
The afterlife could never hold me

[Chorus x2]

[whispered:] This true test of faith. When love turns to hate

This true test of faith, this cross I bear a curse eternal
When love turns to hate hollow be thy name, messiah in black I am

This true test of faith, this cross I bear a curse eternal
When love turns to hate hollow be thy name, messiah in black I am

This true test of faith, this cross I bear a curse eternal
When love turns to hate hollow be thy name, messiah in black I am

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus in background:]
This true test of faith, this cross I bear a curse eternal
When love turns to hate hollow be thy name, messiah in black I am
