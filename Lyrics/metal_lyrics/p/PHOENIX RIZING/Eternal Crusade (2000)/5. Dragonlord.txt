[Music and lyrics by Tom R. Piipoo]

Once upon a time in ancient centuries
When black dragons were rulers of the world
A woman was in labour and a child was born
A secret that was never to be told

Many years went by, the boy became a man
The time had come to let him know his destiny
He was meant to be the dragonlord, the chosen one
A saviour from the tyranny

[Bridge:]
For decades they've waited in slavery
But now that he had come, and he set them free

[Chorus:]
Revelation of the dragonlord
A knight so strong and hold
A long forgotten fairytale, a legend of the old
And with magic and fright
He will come, followed by light
Now the dark ages are over, the black dragons' gone forever

So the time had come, it was a glorious day
The army of the dragonlord was powerful and strong
They had swords made by magic and hearts so pure
The blood of dragons filled the sea

Two years later the last dragon fell
The human race was free from the black reptile's spell
And from that day his wisdom filled the lands
Victory to the dragonlord

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Hail to the one, so powerful and strong
Salute the mighty dragonslayer
He brought freedom to our land
with his sword so strong in hand
We hail the dragonlord

[Chorus]
