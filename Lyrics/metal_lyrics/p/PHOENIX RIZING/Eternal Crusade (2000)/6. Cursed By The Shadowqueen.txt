[Music by Tom R. Piippo, Jack R. Olsen &amp; Yngve Olsen, lyrics by Tom R. Piippo]

I was once a general in the army of the Shadowqueen
I ruled my men with strength and iron fist
I was under the throne's command, its word it was my law
I'd sword an oath of loyalty I never thought I'd break

[Bridge:]
My power grew bigger day by day
And thoughts kept entering my brain
"You have the power, you have my force"
The voice kept on saying, it drove me insane

[Chorus:]
I am cursed by the Shadowqueen
Lost in dungeons I've never seen
There is no way out of here, I'm lost for all eternity
I am cursed by the Shadowqueen
My heart is empty, I'm lost within
I've got her wrath upon my soul, forever I'm alone

My urge for power grew inside, I wanted to become the king
I'd started on my path towards the crown
Over seven years went by before I dared to try
The battle of the shadowthrone, beginning of my fall

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

I never should have challenged her
The throne was much too strong
But now it is too late, I realize that I was wrong
Forever I will drift in darkness
Alone forevermore
My destiny is sealed, I lost the battle of the shadowthrone

I never should have challenged her
The throne was much too strong
But now it is too late, I realize that I was wrong
Forever I will drift in darkness
Alone forevermore
My destiny is sealed, I lost the battle of the shadowthrone
