[Music and lyrics by Jack R. Olsen]

Brave knights in bright, shining armour
Ride into battle to conquer the lands
Unite in the hour of departure
Farewell to the loved ones we've all left behind

A quest for the fortune and glory
Condemned from the moment our journey began
Destiny's path leads us closer
Crossing a border a few men would dare

[Bridge:]
All for one
Inherit our throne
One for all
We've come to claim the crown
Fight or fall
Await the last command

Children of courage and power
Follow our hearts to fulfil out dream
There is a flame of desire
Determined to win, we will never give in

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Ooh take me there
Where evil spirits reign in dread
So far away
Where even shadows fear to tread

All for one
Inherit our throne
We've come to claim the crown
Await the last command

[Chorus x2]
