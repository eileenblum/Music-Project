I feel my body changing, when day turns to night
I walk the empty streets and it feels so right
The days under the sunlight
Fly so swiftly by

Thundernight!
The fall of the light
Thundernight is rising

No cars are driving by
No people watching me
The silence and the darkness is my only key
(Only me)

When darkness comes to life I find your
Do it just like me with open eyes
Getting tired waiting for the next night

Thundernight!
The fall of the light

Thundernight is rising

Only me
When darkness comes to life I find you
Do it just like me with open eyes
Getting tired waiting for the next night

Thundernight!
The fall of the light
Tired waiting for the next night
Thundernight!
The fall of the light

Thundernight is rising
