On the road to redemption
Darkness light my way
Hunting in the wastelands
For the one who got away

Heroes meet in the wings of doom
Hunters side by side
The fiery lust inside shows me
The meaning of my life is to win

Win!
Only win
Anger, lust and pain fills my soul to the brim
The glorious few will fight
Their whole life through to win

Every waking hour I train to be
The strongest and the fiercest
These lands have ever seen
There's no fear in my mind
(In my mind there's only hope)
This hope will set me free
To be the best that I can be

Win!
Only win
Anger, lust and pain fills my soul to the brim
The glorious few will fight
Their whole life through to win

All this training I swear won't be in vain
I'll claim what's rightfully mine
The gold is on its way
Nothing on my horizon but a glorious life
The gods descend, from the sky
To find out why there's just no style quite like my style

There's no fear in my mind
(In my mind there's only hope)
This hope will set me free
To be the best that I can be

Win!
Only win
Anger, lust and pain fills my soul to the brim
So I always win
Hmm, I always, I always win
