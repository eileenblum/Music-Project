Blacked out next to a burning pyre one night
My footsteps leave a trail of undead blight
Your games and your mind create no mystery
You're just yet a shadow of your misery

I'll rule your mind, just stare into my eyes

Stare into my eyes
Stare into my eyes

Tiger, tiger, burning bright in the forest of the night

While elves chant, and dwarves mine
And sirens they sing
My demons are legion and hungering

I cannot attempt an affinity life
I'm the dark from which hatred derives
Your fate has been sealed now
That I rule the dice with my fiery eyes

Tiger tiger burning bright
In the forest of the night
I'll rule your mind, just stare into my eyes

Stare into my eyes
Stare into my eyes
Tiger, tiger, burning bright in the forest of the night

Stare into my eyes
Stare into my eyes
I cannot attempt an affinity life
I'm the dark from which hatred derives
