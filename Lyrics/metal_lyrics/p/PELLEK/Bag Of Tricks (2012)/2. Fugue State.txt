Fly dragon, under the rainbow
Far from monsters, dungeons and scarecrows
(Where do we go?)

I follow the wind
Wish I was the master of my own dream
But I'm trapped inside this fugue state

What happens here will stay with me
Like spots on my reality
Like a second life
I reckon I will spawn somewhere else

I follow the wind
Wish I was the master of my own dream
But I'm trapped inside this fugue state

Gonna kick you off your feet
In this world I can't be beat
Melt two worlds together
We make one that's meant to be

I follow the wind
Wish I was the master of my own dream
But I'm trapped inside this fugue state

I follow the wind
Wish I was the master of my own dream
But I'm trapped inside this fugue state

I follow the wind
In this fugue state
I follow the wind
