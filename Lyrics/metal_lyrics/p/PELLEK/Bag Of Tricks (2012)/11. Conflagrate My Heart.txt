I won't follow you
I'll stay here alone
I won't cause you pain

My hands will grip something
Something no one will miss
Or know that is gone

But it's very hard
I wonder what you two are doing
Entangled in our memories
It pulls me down and conflagrates my heart

Why would I trust that you have changed
When my scars, still cover me in shame
There's no going back for me
I live for myself now, with only you to blame

Oh, did you forget me yet?
I live by night
So you can live by day

Now we won't meet again
I know you don't want to
I did good, right?

I think you'd be proud of me
Of who I am now
(I close my eyes when they are speaking about you)
I hope a little bird sings and whispers about me

'Cause this is so hard
I wonder what you are doing
I'm entangled in our memories
It pulls me down and conflagrates my heart
