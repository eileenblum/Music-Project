Out on the windy lakes, bound on the moore
No one is as lonely as me right now, at least I think
Out there with the kids on the playground
It's all just a game
And every game's the same

Feel like an eagle staring down
Down from a mountain, and now I'm
Falling in to myself
My take on life can be life alone
On it's own

I will sing to the sky, to the mountains I ride
Who will be there to send my message home?
Send my message home
(Send it home)

Life seen through a rich man's eye, a choice between wars
One of which is wrong, but either way he'll take it home
Turning around this dilemma of being the clown
(Oh staring)
Staring down

Feel like an eagle staring down
Down from a mountain, and now I'm
Falling in to myself
My take on life can be life alone

My faith in life, has gone a thousand times
And reappeared

It's gone again, with the ship, my only friend,
Left before the end, so send my message home

Send my message home
Bound on the moore
Send my message home
Allright, send my message home
The waves keep on turning...
