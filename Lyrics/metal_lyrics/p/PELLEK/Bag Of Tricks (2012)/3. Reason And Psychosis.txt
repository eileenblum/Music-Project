Baby don't feel down, just 'cause love's got you blinded
Let's cut your heart open, boy this girl can sing the blues

There's a silver lining, and hope's not lost forever
Free your mind and take my hand
I'll change those thoughts inside your mind

'Cause love's like this
Love's just reason and psychosis
Oh baby, love's just reason and psychosis

Saw a priest hold a gun tonight
(Aiming at the sun)
Oh, aiming at the light of false prophecy

I told him there's a silver lining, and hope's not lost forever
Free your mind and take my hand
I'll change those petty thoughts inside your mind

'Cause love's like this
Love's just reason and psychosis
Love's just reason and psychosis
Love is just reason

Oh love is just reason
Oh yeah, love is just reason
