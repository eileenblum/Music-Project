Say farewell my friend
We'll meet and talk about the
Things you did after I left your world

Empathize, there's a reason I leave you

I don't belong in this world
Seen too much and lived too long
Empty hands can't reach my soul

All my life I have been looking
For a reason to hang on
Since you left that tiny thread
That tied me to this world is gone
It's just me and my screaming demons

I don't belong in this world
Seen too much and lived too long
Empty hands can't reach my soul

Empathize, there's a reason I leave

Saying I don't belong
Telling me there's just pain
Agony tears for the discommode that are the chains
That pull me apart
As my flame fades to dark

I don't belong in this world
Seen too much and lived too long
Empty hands can't reach my soul

Torn in this world
I don't want to live forever
I just dream my life away
Yeah
