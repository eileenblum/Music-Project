What a strange and mystic feeling traveling up in the air
I see night turn into morning, the wind carries me somewhere
It's nicer in this wicker basket than I thought it'd be
Hands behind my head, legs up, the flames are warming me

Over open water, with the sun and the moon
That's me up in the air there in that hot air balloon
There's no way to reach me, I am so far away
Smiling as I pass by the mountains of Chile

After a day among the birds and clouds I start to think
I wish before I left I filled this basket to the brink
With food and water, maybe even a bottle of rum
But I can't be too bothered, I'm enjoying my freedom

Over open water, with the sun and the moon
That's me up in the air there in that hot air balloon
There's no way to reach me, I am so far away
I wonder where the winds is gonna take me today

I notice the ground down there is coming to an end
Soon there'll be just water, maybe I should descend

Over open water, with the sun and the moon
That's me up in the air there in that hot air balloon
There's no way to reach me, I am so far away
Slowly coming down... landing in Lapataia Bay
