A delicate wind graces my hair -
A shiver from the silent fear
One last breath for bravery...
Crystals of salt and sand inhaled as I embark on this journey.

This changes everything -
A whole new life, a whole new world!
Let's sail beyond the horizon -
There is so much more!

Let's begin...

I worked as I was told to
Catalogued the days
Certified events here
Permits and deeds they all came from me

I lived as I was told to
Counting off the days
Paid my bills on time here
Dared not to dream too much in my sleep

In my life
Never someone like her to understand me -
no hero to take her away from this place
She loved me as best she could and did not ask me why
I buried her and quietly filed her away

I did what I was told to
Heeded all the rules
Fell in line in place here
Watched what I said with nothing to say

I felt what I was told to
Turned the other way
Swallowed all my years here
Smiled through the days as my life slipped away

All my life
Never caring to see what's beyond me...
My heart is buried deep in the stone of this land
My daughter took good care and did not ask me why
She's with me now, to quietly sail me away

What is life?
Was I living a life of illusion?
With pencil and stamp I marked the lives lived before me
Old waters and mountains are new in this dying man's eyes
My daughter's in my heart and she will show me the way
