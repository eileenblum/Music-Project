I thought we could rest for a while in this vibrant landscape
Just sleep a day or two, and fill the boat with fish and grapes.
I couldn't help but marvel at the intricate design
Of this perfect symmetric mountain reaching for the sky

But after only one night on the Atlasov Island
The mountain shows its true colors
This is no save haven.
The volcano's erupting, molten rocks shoot through the air
Don't know our destination but we must get out of here!

We're on the run!
Back to the stormy seas
We either stay and burn to death, or we sail and freeze!

We're on the run!
So far from home
If we die today, I pray our spirit will live on!

Ice floes quickly turned into a massive field of ice
Wanted to see the world and now we have to pay the price.
The octopuses in these waters swallow huge sharks whole
I'm not ready to die just yet... I must regain control!

Another ice-cold nightfall in my old brigantine
I'd give all memories years have piled to feel the suns warm gleam.
Soon this tiny wooden boat will be filled bot the brim
With coral, kelp, water and ice... and one too numb to swim!

We're on the run!
Back to the stormy seas
We either stay and burn to death, or we sail and freeze!

We're on the run!
So far from home
If we die today, I pray our spirit will live on!

I hear a roaring waterfall, and feel a surge of strength
I open up my eyes and see a city at arm's length
Buildings ten time taller that the mighty Norway spruce
Huge blinking billboards advertising silver Velcro shoes.

A garden square with majestic temples and tiny trees
A wise old man eating raw fish, drinking the strangest teas.
I step out of my boat and stagger towards this man
He's offering to share...
I think what is this strange new land?
