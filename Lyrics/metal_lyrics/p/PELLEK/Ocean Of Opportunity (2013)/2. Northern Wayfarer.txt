Starting my new life, yeah!
Northern Wayfarer

Sailing nearby the coast, windy on the Barents Sea
What a sight - what a feeling - to be so free
The opulent snow banks on the dark green dying grass spots
Old settlements on the coast where our forefathers fought

Now my life begins on the open sea
I'm content for the first time
I know this is right and I'm ready

Northern Wayfarer!
Starting my new life
Northern Wayfarer!

Northern Wayfarer!
In my heart and in my head
Northern Way, Northern Way
Northern Wayfarer!

Passing and old stone chapel, we bid our Norway farewell
The Russian landscape unfolds, vigor burns in our souls
A burning sense of conceit - we have the world at our feet
The East Siberian Sea surrounding me

Starting my new life on the open sea!
I'm content for the first time
I know this is right and I'm ready

Northern Wayfarer!
Starting my new life
Northern Wayfarer!

Northern Wayfarer!
In my heart and in my head
Northern Way, Northern Way
Northern Wayfarer!

Starting my new life
Out on the sea
Out on the sea - the Northern Way

We carry out our destiny along the fjords courageously
In wind and rain on (the) Barents Sea, we know this is what we were born to be
Wild reindeer, bears, and mountain ox run by our side down by the docks
The Northern Wayfarer is in our hearts 'til the Dovre Mountains fall apart

Northern Wayfarer!
Starting my new life
Northern Wayfarer!

Northern Wayfarer!
In my heart and in my head
Northern Way, Northern Way
Northern Wayfarer!

In my heart a Northern wayfarer
Northern Wayfarer!
