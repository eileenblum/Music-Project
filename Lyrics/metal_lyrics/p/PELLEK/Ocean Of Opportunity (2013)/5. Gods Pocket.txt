Good morning world â I have to say it's great to be alive!
The harbor seals and orca whales are swimming side by side.

The water's clear as crystal and the sun's just woken up â
An intertidal animal looks out behind a rock.

The ochre sea stars tanning in the radiant rays of light,
A black bear and a grizzly bear is crossing the divide.

I think I'll light a fire, ear some food take a swim â
Or maybe I'll just sit a little while and take the beauty in.

This majestic and magical place
Embracing me with beauty, this enchanting haze
Forever in God's Pocket, that's where I will be
When my soul departs from my body

The green and graceful junipers and tallest silver firs
Are looking down at me as I am digging through the earth.

Foraging for nuts and berries, wild mushrooms and roots,
Filing up my boat with the West's richest autumn food.

My journey now continues, I am half way around the world â
Looking back in awe, drifting down mighty blue rivers.

I'm not a navigator; I'm just sailing with the wind
And if the wind is on my side it'll take me here again.

This majestic and magical place
Embracing me with beauty, this enchanting haze
Forever in God's Pocket, that's where I will be
When my soul departs from my body

Drifting southeast, now along the coastline
We hear the civilized circus on port side.

A new chapter starts in a new land
But in my mind I'm still at the island.

This majestic and magical place
Embracing me with beauty, this enchanting haze
Forever in God's Pocket, that's where I will be
When my soul departs from my body
