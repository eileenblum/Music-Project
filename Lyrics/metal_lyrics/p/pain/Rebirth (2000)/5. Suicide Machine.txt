I never do it for nothing
It's never been for free
I never cared about nothing
Unless it satisfied me

My only game is surviving
And try to stay alive
I'm struggling in the underworld
That suffocates my life

Suicide Machine - locked up in this cage
Suicide Machine - I don't understand

They tried to shut me up
They tried to shut me down
They tried to throw me away
I'll never give it up
I'm never gonna stop
I will fight to the end

Suicide Machine

I'll stand tall, I'll break bones
I'll give them hell
No bullshit - I'm still here
You Better catch me dead

You have always tried to crush and break me down
But I will never ever give up without a fight
I am the man - it will always be me
Dreaming of a life in peace, but it was never meant for me

Suicide Machine
