I just cried as she hung me off the ceiling
I just love the pain
I was ready as she raised her whip
And she whipped me so good
She whipped me so good

I never felt this way before
As this thing was spinning around
My hands were tied to this hook
And oh man what she did when she was in control
And she knows what I need
And she's making sure to give it to me
And I don't think I ever want to come down again
She's raping me

She made me stay like a dog
I was ready as she raised her whip
And she whipped me so good
She whipped me so good

She lets me loose sometimes, and makes me do all my needs
But i always crawl back again, so she can do what she please
Sweet love is best, it never makes her sweat
She ties me down for a second round, there's nothing i regret
I was begging for mercy
But on the inside I was begging for more
It's the only way to make me cum!

She made me stay like a dog
Please don't ever stop
She made me stay like a dog
I was ready as she raised her whip, and she whipped me so good
She whipped me so good
