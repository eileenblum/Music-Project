Time is running out, can't you understand the end is coming near,
we gotta wake up fast, i don't wanna fall, all because of someone else,
decide your fate, they'll fuck you in,

burn above the line,
destroy your suffering life, we cannot hide (?--)
the walls are closing in,
you cannot breathe, there can't be no cure when you bleed,

i've been to hell and back again, confronted lucifer.
and stared right through his eyes
i chose a side,
the end of jesus christ, how pathetic and the flames are shooting out
revenge of the devil,

i've seen the angels falling, i feel the pain is coming closing in,
i hear the dead are crying, i see the devil, he's smiling,

of all the power of the mighty flames,
i am the only one that rules now,

he's got your soul,
you'll lose your mind, it's outta control, your gonna die,
the devil is pissed,

i see the angels falling,
i feel the pain is coming closing in, i hear the dead are crying,
i see the devil
he's smiling, the devil's got your soul...

I see the angels falling
I feel the pain is coming crawling in
I hear the dead are crying
I see the devil
He's smiling
(The Devil's curse)
