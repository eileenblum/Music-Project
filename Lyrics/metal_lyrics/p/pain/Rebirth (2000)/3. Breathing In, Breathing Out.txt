Speeding through hell and the devil will set your soul
I'm living your life I'll control your face smashed against the wall

Starting the day with a drink and a fat white line
Their pumping you up with drugs and fame and lies

Breathing in breathing out

I look through the dirt six feet under ground
Buried alive let me out
I'll take my last breath lost my heart then I'll die

Chemicals run through your eyes saving you from going insane
The more that you snort the more you fry your brain

Breathing in breathing out

I look through the dirt six feet under ground
Buried alive let me out
I'll take my last breath lost my heart then I'll die
