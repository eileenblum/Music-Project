Listen here, try me out,
Can you understand a word that I say ?
Life will never turn out the way you want it.
Working hard like a slave, cause you chose to take the honest way
Why does the wind always blow cold and always the wrong way ?
You got to keep your head high and try to be strong
They will try to steal everything you own.
It goes on and on and on
On and on
On and on
On and on

Grab the bull by the horns
Try to make something out of your life
You're the only one that can make it happen
The fire in your eyes is slowly fading out
You can not give up your dreams
You got to go
On and on and on
On and on
On and on

Giving up is easy
Just to throw away your life ,
if you want to take control you can't
give in without a fight.
It goes on and on and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
