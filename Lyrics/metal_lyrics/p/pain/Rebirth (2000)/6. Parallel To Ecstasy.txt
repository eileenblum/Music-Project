(? I feel----calling--?)
I can feel the energy
Feels like I've been up on an experiment on ecstasy
I feel it kicking in again (?--?)
Your only motive, your alive you never die

Searching for those sleepless prayers of your life
Come to find out that you been living a lie
Realities reflect the shadows in the night
Did you ever realize how I know,
Like nowhere riding around with a gun
Ride around the storm will never stop
(?---?) when all the lucky ones get by
Re-entering a pain called life
Pain is life
Life is pain
