I never really ment to hurt you bad
I just sent a computer error
I just want to control your whole life
I just keep you hooked up to my line

Hey little bitch! don't you know it's supposed to work
Hey little bitch your my supersonic bitch

Now I'm hooked back up I got you on my screen
All I can do is press and turn and you spread your legs in the screen
I know I've explored every inch of your naked body
and then you start to bore me I press delete and search for a new target

Hey little bitch don't you know it's supposed to work
Hey little bitch why can't you come here and give me a kiss
Hey little bitch you will always get what you deserve
Hey little bitch your my supersonic bitch!
