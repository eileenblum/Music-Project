Alone in the dark
Awaiting the sun to show it's fate
Will this be my final day
Or has it already gone
So then i just keep away into dreamland

Dark fields of pain are running
Is it me whose wanted
Shadows of death are calling
Am I, am I, am I dying

Shoot me up with the smack
Shoot me up with the bullet
It's all the same game
I cannot hide from my needs
My only saviour is the rush
It will keep my body from bleeding

Dark fields of pain are running
Is it me whose wanted
Shadows of death are calling
Am I, am I am I dying?
