I'm not here so you can knock me down, again
Things have changed and I don't want you on my mind
Don't wanna hear what you got to say
Your little world is not for me
And don't believe everything you see
It's not really what I appears to be
How can I get the message through to you

You try to break me down, I wanna clear my mind
I know now is my time
You're drawn to suffering, I wont give anything
I got nothing to hide
I've been waiting for this moment
Your lies that I can see right through
Thing has moved around, you can't hold me down
The tables have turned

Now I know what you've been looking for
Another you of me so I can hate you more
You're trying to tear me up and spit me out
I'm not here so you can knock me down
I'm just glad to know that I'm done with you

You try to break me down, I wanna clear my mind
I know now is my time
You're drawn to suffering, I won't give anything
I got nothing to hide
I've been waiting for this moment
Your lies that I can see right through
Thing has moved around, you can't hold me down
The tables have turned

Don't wanna hear what you got to say:

I've been waiting for this moment
Your lies that I can see right through
Things has moved around, you can't hold me down
The tables have turned
I've been waiting for this moment
Your lies that I can see right through
Thing has moved around, you can't hold me down
The tables have turned
