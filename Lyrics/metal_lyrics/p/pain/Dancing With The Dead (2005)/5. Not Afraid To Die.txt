A journey through the space, colours, planets everywhere
We're testing our (in)sanity
A razor across our skins, dropping all these magic pills
Can't you see were floating away

Come take my hand, we'll fly away
We'll move in silence
We'll take a trip inside our heads
Frame by frame

We're not afraid to die
We're not afraid to lose our minds
We're not afraid to face the things we left behind
We're not afraid

Can you feel the vibration now
Turn your body inside out
This is really going to hurt
Diving to the sea of hell
Can you hear the judgment bells
It's ringing for you and I

Hear how it's calling out our names
You better drop another pill
It will never be the same
We're going down

We're not afraid to die
We're not afraid to lose our minds
We're not afraid to face the things we left behind
We're not afraid to cry
We're not afraid to kiss the sky
We're not afraid to face the things we left behind

A constant replay of our lives is flashing before my eyes
A silent movie in black and white

Maybe it got too much too soon
It's getting hot as hell, we're burning up, I think we're gonna crash

We're not afraid to die
We're not afraid to lose our minds
We're not afraid to face the things the we left behind
We're not afraid to cry
We're not afraid to kiss the sky
We're not afraid to face the things the we left behind
