Did you ever think you could change the world
The world will change you, it will break you down
It's calling me, my misery
what you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do
It's hunting me, my misery
what you gonna do, what you gonna do what you gonna do

What is wrong with the world today
If it's all it's gonna be the I don't wanna stay
We don't care, we don't hear, we don't see, we just live our lives in hypocrisy
Blinded by our greediness and our souls filled with emptiness
I had enough, it goes on and on
It's calling me, my misery
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do
It's hunting me, my misery
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do

Did you ever think you could change the world
The world will change you, it will break you down
Is it me, who can't be, that I want to believe
Life's too short to disagree
Fear of living alone, fear of growing up all broke
Over and over again, these scary thought just hunt me down
It's calling me, my misery
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do
It's hunting me, my misery
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do
It's calling me, my misery
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do
It's hunting me, my misery
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, what you gonna do
