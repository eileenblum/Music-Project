They tried to build a nation, greater than anyone
But what they didn't know was that someone else would have control
The mob starts infiltrating, at gunpoint they will roam
They show no mercy and the government is on their payroll

No compromising, a nation going blind
The leaders are on their knees
The third wave has just begun

The whole world is corrupted, it's spinning out of control
The third wave is on the roll
It's slipping through our fingers and rising to the top
The third wave is on the roll

Roll with me, roll with me

250 million, involved in organized crime
It's growing like a tumour, we need to find the cure in time
It's coming from the east and trying to control the west
It's crawling across the border right up to the leader's nest

Like a spider's web, politicians in their net
Strings are growing strong
The third wave has just begun

The whole world is corrupted, its spinning out of control
The third wave is on the roll
Its slipping through our ringers and rising to the top
The third wave is on the roll

Roll with me
Roll with me
Roll with me

It's on the roll, it's on the roll, it's on the roll

The whole world is corrupted, its spinning out of control
The third wave is on the roll
It's slipping through our fingers and rising to the top
The third wave is on the roll
The whole world is corrupted, it's on the roll
The whole world is corrupted, it's on the roll
The whole world is corrupted, it's on the roll
