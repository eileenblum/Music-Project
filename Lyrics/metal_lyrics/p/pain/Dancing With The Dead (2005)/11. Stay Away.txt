Stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away

I'm on the road to nowhere, cause you're holding me down
Your urge for my flesh just scares me, don't you follow me around
You're walking in my shadows and in my shoes, every step I take
I can feel you all around, like the air I inhale

Sucking all my energy, you know you must feed of me
I'm starting to run dry
My body is all that I have left, all the things you said
Why do you do this to me?
Stay away, stay away
You got to stay away
Stay away, stay away
Get away
Stay away, stay away
I need to get away
Stay away, stay away
Get away

Creeping and crawling, drooling on me, every time I turn my head
I can't get you to disappear from me, you trap me in your cage
There's no way you're ever gonna stop, you're playing games for keeps
You're licking your wounds and swear to me, you would bury me deep
Your head is set to break me down, fuck me up and kick me out
You don't care what it takes
Vengeance is burning in your eyes
I know what you got on you mind
I really need to get away
Stay away, stay away
You got to stay away
Stay away, stay away
Get away
Stay away, stay away
I need to get away
Stay away, stay away
Get away

I can not get away from you, I see you
You need me, I'm not sad
I can't believe it
Stay away, stay away
You got to stay away
Stay away, stay away
Get away
Stay away, stay away
I need to get away
Stay away, stay away
Get away
