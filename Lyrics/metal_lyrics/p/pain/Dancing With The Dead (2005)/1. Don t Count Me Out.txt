I never wanted to see it from the bright side
I didn't care, I didn't have the time
Life is too short to stop and look around
All I knew was that I had to do everything at once
Do this, right here, right now
Don't care if that's the price I have to pay
I'll worry about it later cause maybe I won't live another day

Why must I die

You're living, you're taking, you're giving, you're breaking
It's not enough you're alive and it's a misery
Can't take it, can't fake it, I won't run away and hide
Don't count me out cause I'm not here to sit around and rot
Don't count me out, it won't get to me
Don't count me out, I'm not here to sit around and rot
Don't count me out

I don't know where I'm heading, just know where I've been
There's no use fighting nature cause there's things you can never win
I don't look back, full speed ahead, I'll do it till my neck snaps
I don't have nine lives  to live so I'll use the only on I ever had

Why must I die

You're living, you're taking, you're giving, you're breaking
It's not enough you're alive and it's a misery
Can't take it, can't fake it, I won't run away and hide
Don't count me out cause I'm not here to drown
Don't count me out, it won't get to me
Don't count me out, I'm not here to sit around and rot
Don't count me out
