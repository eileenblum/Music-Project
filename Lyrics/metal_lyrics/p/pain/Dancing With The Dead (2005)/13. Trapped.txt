[Bonus Track]Uh!

I count people in every country sitting on their ass
Try to make a decision whether to sell my stuff or pass.

Don't wanna be in this universal family
It ain't worth it to me
I signed my name in blood and now I'm really fucked.
There's no way I can get out of this misery.

[Chorus:]
Trapped in this hell
I see my life flash before my eyes
Trapped in this hell
No matter what I do, I'm stuck to you

What do you want from me? I do the best I can
It's not easy to be motivated when you don't even give a damn

Why should I care? It's just a waste of time
When you don't even have me on your mind
No matter what you say its gonna by the same
There's no one who cares, I've lost my faith in you.

[Chorus:]
Trapped in this hell
I see my life flash before my eyes
Trapped in this hell
I don't want you and you don't need me

Trapped in this hell
Just let me go, I don't want to stay
Trapped in this hell
No matter what I do, I'm stuck to you

[Chorus:]
Trapped in this hell
I see my life flash before my eyes
Trapped in this hell
I don't want you and you don't need me

Trapped in this hell
Just let me go, I don't want to stay
Trapped in this hell
No matter what I do, I'm stuck to you
