Tell me what do you see when you see yourself
I don't really get it, how do you make it through the day without killing yourself
Bye bye, why don't you go and
Die die, I'll fuck you up
You want me on my knees but I'm not going down
Bye bye, leave me alone or
Die die, it's your choice
No time for games, so just leave me the fuck alone

Do you know, you're all the same
Got to play these stupid games
You're getting on my nerves, so just stay the fuck away
Who died and made you god
This time you've gone to far
I think it-s time for you to understand: this is war

There's nothing to see here, I don't wanna be here
Get me out of here right now
I can not sit around and wait for you to drive me insane
Bye bye, why don't you go and
Die die, I'll fuck you up
You want me on my knees but I'm not going down
Bye bye, leave me alone or
Die die, it's your choice
No time for games, so just leave me the fuck alone

So you think I'm unreasonable
Do you really think I am a toy that you can kick around
Don't come here you're a waste of time
Some people never know, when it's time to back away
It will come back at you and slap you in the face

There's nothing to see here, I don't wanna be here
Get me out of here right now
I can not sit around and wait for you to drive me insane
I don't have patience so what are you after
Do you want me to snap right now
Some things will never ever change, like you and your ugly face
Bye bye, why don't you go and
Die die, I'll fuck you up
You want me on my knees but I'm not going down
Bye bye, leave me alone or
Die die, it's your choice
No time for games, so just leave me the fuck alone

Bye bye, its your choice
Die die, I'll fuck you up

Bye bye, why don't you go and
Die die, leave me alone
