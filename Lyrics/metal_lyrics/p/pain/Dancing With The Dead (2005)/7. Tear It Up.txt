I am the one who choose the path in my life
I don't need you to tell me what is right
You have to learn to crawl before you walk
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger than rock
Make your mistakes and wipe it off your back
Don't you be pulling the break, its' full speed ahead

Tear it up - Free fall from the sky
Tear it up - Kiss your ass goodbye
You're livin' and you're learning
Hopefully before you die
Tear it up - Crack your head
Tear it up - You know how its gonna end
Your running against the wall
Smash your face and wake up boy

How can you say that you are living your life
You don't take chances you're just waiting to die
It's no crime to fuck around, so don't you waste your time
Cause you don't know when you'll be throwing in the towel
Taste the pain, my game, I'll make you go insane
Now it's time to let go, its just full speed ahead

Tear it up - Free fall from the sky
Tear it up - Kiss your ass goodbye
You're livin' and you're learning
Hopefully before you die
Tear it up - Crack your head
Tear it up - You know how its gonna end
Your running against the wall
Smash your face and wake up boy

Tear it up, wake up boy, tear it up
Tear it up, wake up boy, tear it up

Now's the time for you to understand
Cause your breathing doesn't mean you're alive
Turn it on, self control before you start to fall
Don't you be pulling the break, its full speed ahead

Tear it up - Free fall from the sky
Tear it up - Kiss your ass goodbye
You're livin' and you're learning
Hopefully before you die
Tear it up - Crack your head
Tear it up - You know how it's gonna end
You're running against the wall
Smash your face and wake up boy
