Why are we never satisfied,
The Grass is always greener on the other side
Fear of never having enough, dreams that turns into rust
sometimes it's better to leave things alone
the road to success is hard and cold
I'm turning into something I don't wanna be
I've got a feeling that something is changing me
I can not let it all slip away
It's driving me insane

I don't wanna be nothing
Time is ticking, I feel stranded
I don't wanna be nothing
Make it go away

Fighting the battle that's growing within
It doesn't matter if I loose or win
its getting to the point where I can't get away
I can not let it all slip away
It's driving me insane
I don't wanna be nothing
Time is ticking, I feel stranded
I don't wanna be nothing
make it go away

I don't wanna be nothing
Hate is growing inside of me
I don't wanna be nothing
I'm taking back what used to be mine
I can't believe my luck is bleeding
My demons refuse to let me go
The light in the tunnel I see is fading
My fire of life is burning low

I don't wanna be nothing
Time is ticking, I feel stranded
I don't wanna be nothing
Make it go away
Hate is growing inside of me
I don't wanna be nothing
I'm taking back what used to be mine
I don't wanna be nothing
Take me from this hell I'm in
I don't wanna be nothing
My whole life I've been the only enemy
I don't wanna be nothing
Hate is growing inside of me
I don't wanna be nothing
I'm taking back what used to be mine
