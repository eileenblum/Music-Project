[Bonus Track]IÂ´ve been driving down
The dark and strange highways
And IÂ´ve lived it all itÂ´s all a part of my life
I sold my soul to the devil
A desperate man in desperate times

Too blind to see
Living on the lies that feeds me illusions

I keep falling
Falling into selfish bliss crashing down
I am crawling
Crawling through remains of bitterness

We all been goinÂ´ through hell
It doesnÂ´t matter who you are
You come out a stronger man
You used to see the world in gray
Burn on and cold in bed
Now youÂ´re too old to give a damn

Too blind to see
Living on the lies that feeds me illusions
Pretend to live kills my enemies

I keep falling
Falling into selfish bliss crashing down
I am crawling
Crawling through remains of bitterness

Unseen is there anybody out there no
Unheard can you hear me screaming

I keep falling
Falling into selfish bliss crashing down
I am crawling
Crawling through remains of bitterness
I am falling I am crawling
