The nature's abuser
The creature takes what it wants
We have no future, All hope is gone

Just crush the weak, the winner takes it all
Money makes them breathe, but not for long
How can I smile again, when it's all gonna end?

Another smoke screen, another toxic dream
We cannot change 'cause this is what we are
I want more, you want more, he wants more, she wants more
Time is ticking and we all will fall
Another oil spill, another black dream
It's not enough to live in this filthy world
I want more, you want more, he wants more, she wants more
Time is ticking and we all will fall. We will fall..

When it's all been crushed, then the winner has lost it all

The nature's abuser
The creature takes what it wants
We have no future, All hope is gone

I can not smile again cause I know it's gonna end

Another smoke screen, another toxic dream
We cannot change 'cause this is what we are
I want more, you want more, he wants more, she wants more
Time is ticking and we all will fall
Another oil spill, another black dream
It's not enough to live in this filthy world
I want more, you want more, he wants more, she wants more
Time is ticking and we all will fall.
