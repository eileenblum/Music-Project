Time, I cannot turn back
I'm not living in the past
Air, it's not my first breath
Why didn't anyone tell me I'm insane

I'm having my own revolution
I'm the first in line to see the light
The doctor's giving me new medication
And I'm flying high again
Now I'm taking a permanent vacation
The monster's tamed inside of me

You got to feed the monster

Time, I cannot turn back
I'm not living in the past
Air, it's not my first breath
Why didn't anyone tell me I'm insane

I'm having my own revolution
I'm the first in line to see the light
The doctor's giving me new medication
And I'm flying high again
Now I'm taking a permanent vacation
The monster's tamed inside of me

Life, I'm not the one that's on trial
Stop, I have not time to fuck around
Life, you cannot be what you wanna be
Why, I am what I am and I stand where I stand
Feed my monster

The docter's giving me new medication
And I'm flying high again
Now I'm taking a permanent vacation
The monster's tamed inside of me, Feed the monster
