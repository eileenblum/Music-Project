You can bitch all you want cause I don't care
It's a real fine line between being good and being bad
Might as well crash and burn cause we never ever gonna learn
I rather stick to being a bad boy than being real burned

Now I got your attention
I need to ease my mind
You think you are the main attraction

I am your great pretender the hero and you savior
I am your great pretender the alien you surrender to

Now when our future is dark
And it's hard to predict
Can someone please tell me, Who I am supposed to be
I just keep on rolling till someone stops me
Don't wanna live in the past, I just wanna be me

Now I got your full attention
I need to ease my mind
You feel you are the main attraction

I am your great pretender the hero and you savior
I am your great pretender the alien you surrender to

Reach for the sky, and I'll be there
Step into the light I'll pull you trough
Just close your eyes and take my pills

I am your great pretender the hero and you savior
I am your great pretender the alien you surrender to
Reach for the sky, and I'll be there
