I cannot breathe suffocating slow
I need to come up for Air
The monster's in my head they won't leave me be
I told them thousand times, just stay away from me
A constant battle within, A battle I can't win
It triggers the fear of failure
Stereotype society you better think like others think
Remote controll human disaster

World turns dead right before me
I can't hide in the past, I need to break away from me
Life burns black, no sanctuary
I did my time so let me out

Like a broken record, it repeats itself
Like a wheel.. and round and round it goes
It's like we're on a path, on a path to nowhere
Running out of time, running out of passion
Once created times, now a storm of nails
Razor sharp and it won't stop yet

World turns dead right before me
I can't hide in the past, I need to break away from me
Life burns black, no sanctuary
I did my time so let me out

Running out of ways to run, it's a dead end street
Been taking all the turns.. They all turn back to me

World turns dead right before me
I can't hide in the past, I need to break away from me
Life burns black, no sanctuary
I did my time so let me out
