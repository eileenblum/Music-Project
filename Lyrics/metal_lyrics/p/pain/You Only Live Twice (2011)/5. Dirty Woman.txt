I just fell out the sky
It's been a hell of a ride, I'm back again
Things were looking good
It was on the move, untill I met you

Sweet lucy in the sky
Got a smile of an angel, come here and spread your wings
I'm just a dirty old man
Trying to play your game, I'll set your wings on fire

She knocks me down
I'm in for the count
I'm going down
Oh dirty women
She tricks you with her smile
My dirty women
She's in for the kill, killing me

Her needs, her life
Not afraid to show what's on her mind
I never listened to a word what people said
To stay away from you
Cause I don't need no women to slow me down
Don't wanna sing the blues, No..!

She knocks me down
I'm in for the count
I'm going down
Oh dirty women
She tricks you with her smile
My dirty women
She's in for the kill, killing me
