Some people's love is other's hate
Depression, jealousy of other's faith
Some seems just to have it all
But in their shadows
There's a dark life and a broken heart

You need to break away from the chain
No more fears
And set the rules in your own lonely game
Than you only live twice, you only live twice

Shake your money maker
It's time to work
She's got mouths to feed
Dancing with one foot in the dirt
For some it's strugle, for others hell
When the addiction grabs onto you you're under it's spell

You need to break away from the chain
No more fears
And set the rules in your own lonely game
Than you only live twice, you only live twice

Do we all deserve a second chance? Do we care?
Did you fear the devil's hand when you made the deal?
Don't you wanna live twice?
You only live twice
