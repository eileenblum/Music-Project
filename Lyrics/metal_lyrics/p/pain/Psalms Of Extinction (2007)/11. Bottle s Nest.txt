Woke up this morning
with my head in the dirt
Master of disaster has raped my soul again
I feel like shit and my body hurts
What did I do?
Can't remember a thing
Not a thing

It's constant battle
And the bottle always wins

I wanna go all the way
Down the bottle's nest
I'm gonna go all the way
Why pretend?

I'm falling

Another day
Another party
Another toast
I slam the drink
And I almost fall
And the madness is ready to choke my throat

It doesn't matter
It won't hurt at all
Not at all

I've stopped fighting the bottle
'Cause the bottle always wins

I wanna go all the way
Down the bottle's nest
I'm gonna go all the way
Why pretend?

Pour me another drink
Oh how I need it bad
Pour me another drink
Pour it down my throat

I wanna go all the way
Down the bottle's nest
I'm gonna go all the way
Why pretend?
