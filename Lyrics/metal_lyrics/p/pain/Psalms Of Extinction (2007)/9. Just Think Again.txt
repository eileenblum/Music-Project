Have you ever seen a child die?
Did you even know that it exists?
Did you know people outside your walls are starving to death?

So what would you do if it was up to you?
Would you even care?
I bet you would look another way and think of better things

Oh no, it's better to look away
You better close your eyes
Oh no, you don't wanna see anyone die
You just want to live your pretty life

Why won't we do anything?
Build up a wall around you so you don't have to see
Don't wanna preach but just think again

Oh no, it's better to look away
You better close your eyes
Oh no, you don't wanna see anyone die
You just want to live your pretty life

Why won't we do anything?
Build up a wall around you so you don't have to see
Don't  wanna preach but just think again
