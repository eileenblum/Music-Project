Now I've got something to say
So just get out of my way
I won't take shit from you or anyone that stands in my way
I've been quiet too long and now it's out of control
I've had it up to here and nothing's gonna stop me now

I don't believe in god or destiny
I always lived my life with one foot into the grave
The world is cruel and filled with enemies
I take my chances cause I know my life won't go anywhere

We're searching, we're burning out
It's hard to find when both feet are nailed to the ground
We're stranded, we're all tied up
We're hammered down with both feet are nailed to the ground

Nothing in life is for free, everything has price
You start to pay when you're born until the day you die
They turn you into a machine and keep you in the line
If you fall out of their path they will come after you

I don't believe in god or destiny
I always lived my life with one foot into the grave

We're searching, we're burning out
It's hard to find when both feet are nailed to the ground
We're stranded, we're all tied up
We're hammered down with both feet are nailed to the ground

Ah, I won't go down on my knees
They won't stop until I hit rock bottom
No.... I won't go down on my knees
In this government controlled society
NO NO NO... I won't go down...

We're searching, we're burning out
It's hard to find when both feet are nailed to the ground
We're stranded, we're all tied up
We're hammered down with both feet are nailed to the ground
