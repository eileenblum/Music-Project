Why do we have to live in fear?
The future's looking dark
No one seems to care

It's a shame, it keeps pounding my head
I feel sick, is there someone to blame?

Now where do we go
When there's nowhere to turn?
It's starting to show
Will we ever learn?

Countdown to extinction
It has only begun
We're heading for extinction
To be one with the sun

The sun is burning through our skin the blood is boiling hot
Cancer's spreading out
I see the end is closing in
The world is turning black, acid rain

It's a shame, it keeps pounding my head
I feel sick, is there someone to blame?

Now where do we go
When there's nowhere to turn?
It's starting to show
Will we ever learn?

Do you feel ready to die?
Or have you changed your mind?

Countdown to extinction
It has only begun
We're heading for extinction
To be one with the sun

Now where do we go
When there's nowhere to turn?
It's starting to show
Will we ever learn?
