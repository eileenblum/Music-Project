So how many times do I have to pick myself up
When you're just crushing my life?
So I can carry on
Fill my soul so hollow

I've been down the drain
And washed away
And still I come back for more
I keep my head up high
Always try to walk the line

I'm not like you
My life flashes before my eyes
No, I'm not like you
The truth turns me upside down

Here it comes again
Pain is calling me
And I don't understand
It's just like walking on glass
Here we go again
And I can't turn it off
It's been  following my past
It's just like walking on glass

Life's too short but I don't give a fuck
Why try to think like you
I have my own free will
Life is built on sorrow

Fields of burning lies is getting clearer by age
Soon we start to realize
Born and raised in a cage

I'm not like you
My life flashes before my eyes
No, I'm not like you
The truth turns me upside down

Here it comes again
Pain is calling me
And I don't understand
It's just like walking on glass
Here we go again
And I can't turn it off
It's been  following my past
It's just like walking on glass

Walk with me
It's getting dark
Walk with me
We'll try to save our broken souls

Here it comes again
Pain is calling me
And I don't understand
It's just like walking on glass
Here we go again
And I can't turn it off
It's been  following my past
It's just like walking on glass
