Computerized technology
Wipes out all your enemies
Digital world controls
A dying analogue blasphemy

Distorted codes in your DNA
Passwords running through the veins
Our brain cells overwon
By the zeros and by the ones

This is the end of humanity - thrill me, kill me
Computer god is the enemy - deceive me, delete me
There is no lord that will set us free - thrill me, kill me
The computer god is the enemy - deceive me, delete me

Computerized technology
Wipes out all your enemies
Digital world controls
A dying analogue blasphemy

Acid dreams and hate patrols
Anarchy put the wold on hold
Cyber love, my only love
Never complains, she's under my thumb

This is the end of humanity - thrill me, kill me
Computer god is the enemy - deceive me, delete me
There is no lord that will set us free - thrill me, kill me
The computer god is the enemy - deceive me, delete me
