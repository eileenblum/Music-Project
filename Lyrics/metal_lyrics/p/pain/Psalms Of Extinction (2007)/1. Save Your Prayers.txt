Hey you, I know you don't like me
But the feeling is mutual
Pardon my French, slimy bitch
Do I care? Of course, I wrote this song for you

Save your prayers cause I don't care
Your tongue is digging your own grave
We are born with our conscience clear
By the time you're 15 your life is full of misery

The frames of lies you cannot escape
It's calling your name
Mistakes of your past you can't erase
It's coming back to you

Why don't you stop cause you're nothing
I don't care cause you're nothing
Why don't you leave cause you're nothing
Disappear cause you're nothing

Save your prayers cause I don't care
Your tongue is digging your own grave
We are born with our conscience clear
By the time you're 15 your life is full of misery

The frames of lies you cannot escape
It's calling your name
Mistakes of your past you can't erase
It's coming back to you
