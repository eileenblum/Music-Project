Does it really matter anyway?
You have to feel real bad
Before you can feel good again
Drown before you can breathe the air
Blinded by hate
Until you can't open your eyes to see
That it takes  more than a knife to make you bleed

Does it really matter anyway
That we won't get what we're searching for
We slave through life to stay alive
To get a piece of the pie
Does it really matter anyway
That we cannot reach our goals
The more we work, the more we earn
The more we live, the more we burn

With money we think we're god
With success we think we can do whatever we want
But when your star starts to fade
You crawl back to a nothing, into your shell

Does it really matter anyway

Regrets from your past
Makes your future collapse
Insecured by failure
Anxiety attacks
Your heart's still pumping
While your veins are running dry
The clock is ticking
But the time stands still

Does it really matter anyway
That we won't get what we're searching for
We slave through life to stay alive
To get a piece of the pie
Does it really matter anyway
That we cannot reach our goals
The more we work, the more we earn
The more we live, the more we burn

Does it really matter anyway
