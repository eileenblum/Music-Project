Do you need me ?
Do you need me to punish you for all of your sins ?

Oh I need you!

Do you want me ?
Do you want me to bring up the animal in you ?

Oui je te veux !
Oui je te veux toi pour Ã©veiller tout mes dÃ©mons
Je ne peux plus me passer de toi !
Tu es mon seul dÃ©sir
Besoin de toi pour, Ã©veiller mes dÃ©sirs

My Angel slept with the devil
He stole her wings
My angelÂ´s hurt forever
Her lust made her weak
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

Do you want me ?
Do you want me to bring up the animal in you ?

Jâai besoin de toi !
Jâai besoin de toi pour ne plus rire de tous mes vices

You canât ignore me
I am the only one
I know you need me
Iâm the one that wakes up your lust

My Angel slept with the devil
He stole her wings
My angelÂ´s hurt forever
Her lust made her weak

Jâai rencontrÃ© le diable,
Il mâa brisÃ© les ailes
Perdu pour toujours,
Mon dÃ©sir fera ma perte
Aah aah aah aah aah aah
Made her weak
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

Je ne peux plus me passer de toi,
Tu es mon seul dÃ©sir
Besoin de toi pour Ã©veiller mes dÃ©sirs

Jâai rencontrÃ© le diable
Il mâa brisÃ© les ailes

Perdu pour toujours,
Mon dÃ©sir fera ma perte

Jâai rencontrÃ© le diable
Il mâa brisÃ© les ailes
Perdu pour toujours,
Mon dÃ©sir fera ma perte

[English translation:]

Do you need me ?
Do you need me to punish you for all of your sins ?

Oh I need you!

Do you want me ?
Do you want me to bring up the animal in you ?

Yes I want you!
Yes I want you to wake up all of my demons
I canât go without you!
You are my only desire
I need you to wake up my desires

My Angel slept with the devil
He stole her wings
My angelÂ´s hurt forever
Her lust made her weak
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

Do you want me ?
Do you want me to bring up the animal in you ?

I need you!
I need you to stop laughing about my âvicesâ

You canât ignore me
I am the only one
I know you need me
Iâm the one that wakes up your lust

My Angel slept with the devil
He stole her wings
My angelÂ´s hurt forever
Her lust made her weak

I met the devil,
He broke my wings
Lost forever,
My desire will lead to my loss
Aah aah aah aah aah aah
...made her weak
Aah aah aah aah aah aah

I canât go without you!
You are my only desire
I need you to wake up my desires

I met the devil,
He broke my wings
Lost forever

My desire will lead to my loss

I met the devil,
He broke my wings
Lost forever,
My desire will lead to my loss
