My mean green Devil,

My mean green fire, 
turn on the magic touch.

Life is so wonderful,
life is but a dream.
You get into my veins,
and set me free.

Away, away, away!
Come on and take me now.
Bye, bye, bye!

Sweet green ferry,
blasting through the sky.
Hallucinations coming,
stars are shining bright.

Life is so wonderful,
life is but a dream.
Come and turn me on.
