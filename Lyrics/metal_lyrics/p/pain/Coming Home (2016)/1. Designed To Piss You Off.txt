I was born to raise Hell,
not in God's favor.
I will burn for my sins.

I'm not his son,
I'm not his flavor.
I guess I'm going to Hell.

That's me, designed to piss you off.
That's me, alive and flipping you off.
My rules, I win, you lose!

If I drink all night and fall to the floor,
don't preach at me 'cause I will drink a lot more.
They have all tried to teach me how to live my life.
How to act my age, sorry you just wasting your time.

That's me, designed to piss you off.
That's me, alive and flipping you off.
My life, my mind, you're a fool.

That's me, designed to piss you off.
That's me, alive and flipping you off.
My rules, I win, you lose!

Time's ticking, getting older.
Time won't break me down!
Save all your fears, 
I have no plans to slow down.

That's me, designed to piss you off.
My life, my mind, you're a fool.
That's me, alive and flipping you off.
My rules, I win, you lose!
