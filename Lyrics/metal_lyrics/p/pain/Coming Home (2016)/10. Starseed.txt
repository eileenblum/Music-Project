Like the stars in the night sky,
that's where we from,
that's where we belong.
I tell you why!

The source of creation, 
and density, unknown.

It's bigger than you and me.
It's bigger than God, 
you will soon find out.

For all those who's gone,
our souls lives on and on.

I'm not to far from finding out,
I guess I have to wait.
Watch me glow, I'm a starseed.

Sanctuary is what I need, 
to put my soul to peace.
Bring me home, I'm a starseed.

Looking up at the sky at night,
it gives me a calm, 
that no drug could ever replace.

It makes my body vibrate, 
in a higher frequency.
As the final destination,
I know that's where I go,
that's where I belong.

For all those who died,
our souls lives on and on.

We're not to far from finding out,
I guess we have to wait.
Watch us glow, we're the starseeds.

Sanctuary is what we need, 
to put our souls to peace.
Bring us home, we're the starseeds.

I don't belong here, 
take me home!

We're not to far from finding out,
I guess we have to wait.
Watch us glow, we're the starseeds.

Sanctuary is what we need, 
to put our souls to peace.
Bring us home, we're the starseeds.
