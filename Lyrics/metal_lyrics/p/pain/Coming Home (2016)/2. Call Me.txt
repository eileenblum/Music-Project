If you got the cash, I've got the time.
I'm just a phone call away.
You've been dried up for a long, long time?
With my hands and tongue I'll make you howl like a wolf.

Call me like a Genie in the bottle,
I rub you the right way.
Call me, with Paypal or Cash,
I wanna be your back door man.

I don't care about your present or your past,
I love you as long as your money loves me back.
I'll meet you at home or at a sleazy motel,
and I show you what your boyfriend don't understand.

Call me like a Genie in the bottle,
I rub you the right way.
Call me, with Paypal or Cash,
I wanna be your back door man.

Who said money can't buy you happiness?
It's your fantasy, just give me a call.

Call me like a Genie in the bottle,
I rub you the right way.
Call me, with Paypal or Cash,
I wanna be your back door man.
