Do you wanna crawl around in the dirt,
can't get off your knees to get back to the herd?
You do the time while others do the crime.
Your whole life is falling down.

Do you wanna be the president?
Do you wanna be the judge?
Will you fight for the innocent,
or do you wanna be a wannabe or be the real deal?

Do you wanna be a hypocrite?
Do you wanna be a fraud?
Can you feel that you're living it,
or do you wanna be a wannabe or be the real thing?

Don't believe in everything that you see,
on the net and on the news on TV.
It pulls you left and right to make you live in fear.
Systematic brain drain.

Do you wanna be the president?

Do you wanna be a hypocrite?
Do you wanna be a fraud?
Can you feel that you're living it,
