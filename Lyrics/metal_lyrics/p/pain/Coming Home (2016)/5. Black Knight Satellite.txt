Sitting on the top of the world
Silently watching you watching me
It's been around for thirteen thousand years
Purpose unknown

Black knight satellite
Dark shadows flying high
You are the ghost that watch the sky

In the blackness of space
Orbiting around the earth
Been scanning us feeling us
Down to the core
Poor humanity

Black knight satellite
Dark shadows flying high
You are the ghost that watch the sky
Black knight satellite
What are you searching for?
The silent ghost in the sky

Black knight satellite
Black knight satellite
Black knight satellite
What are you looking for?
You are the ghost that watch the sky
Black knight satellite
What are you searching for?
The silent ghost in the sky
