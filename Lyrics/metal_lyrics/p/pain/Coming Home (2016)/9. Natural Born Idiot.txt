Don't tell me how to run my life,
don't tell me how to act.
All I see is your lips that's moving,
and what I hear from you is crap.

Some people I met is not so bright.
You know, not really that smart.
Why do they end up next to me,
with their torturing talk?

Shut up! 
I don't wanna hear you anymore.
IQ 0.84!

Shut up,
or get to the point!
Natural born idiot.

Idiot!

Just another worn out voice, 
with a worn out face.
There's no God that can save your soul.
I got no room 'cause you're insane.

Shut up! 
I don't wanna hear you anymore.
IQ 0.84!

Shut up,
or get to the point!
Natural born idiot.
