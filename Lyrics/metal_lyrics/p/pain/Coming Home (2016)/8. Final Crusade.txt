Living it up, burning it down.
They try to tear us apart,
to make us hate ourselves.

Just hold on! 
How can we go wrong, 
in this beautiful world,
that's spinning out of control?

Left, right, left, right!
We're marching right over the cliff,
sending us straight to our grave.

Left, right, left, right!
Like animals send to the butcher.
Time to feel his blade.

The last fight, the last breath!
We are the final generation.
Time to say goodbye.

The last meal, the last smile!
We are the final crusaders.
Because nothing lasts forever.

Lovely lies, children cries.
Peoples dreams are crushed.
Cabals have made their point.

Who's in charge, who will die?
No one can stop their crimes.
Life is wonderful.

Left, right, left, right!
We're marching right over the cliff,
sending us straight to our grave.

Left, right, left, right!
Like animals send to the butcher.
Time to feel his blade.

The last fight, the last breath!
We are the final generation.
Time to say goodbye.

The last meal, the last smile!
We are the last crusaders.
Because nothing lasts forever.

The last fight, the last breath!
We are the final generation.
Get ready to die!

The last meal, the last smile!
We are the final crusaders.
Because nothing lasts forever.

Left, right, left, right!
Time to say goodbye.
Left, right, left, right!
Because nothing lasts forever.

The last fight, the last breath!
We are the final generation.
Time to say goodbye.

The last meal, the last smile!
We are the last crusaders.
Because nothing lasts forever.

The last fight, the last breath!
We are the final generation.
Get ready to die!

The last meal, the last smile!
We are the final crusaders.
Because nothing lasts forever.
