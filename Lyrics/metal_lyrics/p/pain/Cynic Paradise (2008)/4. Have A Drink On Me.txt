I don't believe in love
I love the way it tastes
Please don't expect too much
'cause I don't wanna be involved

I had my share of women
Even some marriage too
And every time I end up with my pants down
Lookin' like a fool

I'm such a fool...

The older you are, the wiser you get
Just listen to me
When life gets tough and you know it will
Then have a drink on me

The alcohol never talks back to me
It never tells me when it's time to go home
It's been my friend for over 25 years
And she has never cut me low

Don't cut me low

The older you are, the wiser you get
Just listen to me
When life gets though and you know it will
Then have a drink on me

Too many women, too little time
(Yeah!)
And not enough whiskey
Not enough booze for me

I rather lose my liver than to lose my pride
And when I'm dead and buried
Then just have a drink on me

I don't believe in love
So don't expect too much

The older you are, the wiser you get
Just listen to me
When life gets though and you know it will
Then have a drink on me
The older you are, the wiser you get
Just listen to me
When life gets though and you know it will
Then have a drink on me
Just have a drink
