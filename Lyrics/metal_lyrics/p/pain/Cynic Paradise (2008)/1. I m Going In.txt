You don't believe in what I'm doin'
How much more do I have to prove you
I can't give up what I've started
I'm not a quitter this is what I do

Oh yeah

Can you look in my eyes
Without telling me a bunch of lies?
All I asked for was the truth
I thought it was me, but now I know it's you

Liar

I'm going in
Into the fire, I'm pulling you out
I'm going in
I'm cooling down your skin

Do you like how I treat you?
Or should I treat you like a movie star?
Something good just went so bad
I got to bring you down

I'm going in
Into the fire, I'm pulling you out
I'm going in
I'm cooling down your skin
I'm going in
Into the fire, I'm pulling you out
I'm going in
I'm cooling down your skin

Dream on little liar
Truth will call out your name

I'm going in
Into the fire, I'm pulling you out
I'm going in
I'm cooling down your skin
I'm going in
Into the fire, I'm pulling you out
I'm going in
I'm cooling down your skin
