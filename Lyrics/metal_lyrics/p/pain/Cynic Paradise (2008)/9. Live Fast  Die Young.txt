We all are crying for the life we can not get
The mystery of mankinds complex DNA

We're running out of meaning
We're running out of being alive
We have no purpose breathing
Might as well just spit and die

Live fast, die young
Who cares about the world when it soon will be gone
Burn fast, die hard
There is no future and there's nowhere to run

I won't support the lies of saving our world
We're already out of time and soon we all gonna burn

The climate is big business, everyone is trying to make a dime
We have no purpose breathing
Might as well just spit and die...

Live fast, die young
Who cares about the world when it soon will be gone
Burn fast, die hard
There is no future and there's nowhere to run
The floods and hurricanes harvest lives
It's just a taste of cynic paradise... we're all gonna die

Live fast, die young
Who cares about the world when it soon will be gone
Burn fast, die hard
There is no future and there's nowhere to run
