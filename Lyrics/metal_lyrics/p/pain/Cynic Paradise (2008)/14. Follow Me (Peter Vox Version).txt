[Bonus track]

Follow me good luck has never been my friend I've always been the fool
Please don't follow shadows of mine 'cause the time is running out for me
I walk in the path of a misfit's blood no compass can stare my way
No light at the end of the tunnel and time is running out for me
No gold at the end of the rainbow no high hopes dreams deceive
Follow me the trouble seems to always wanna follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you follow me
The trouble seems to always wanna follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you follow me
I walk in the path of a misfit's blood no compass can stare my way
No light at the end of the tunnel and time is running out for me
No gold at the end of the rainbow no high hopes dreams deceive
Follow me the trouble seems to always wanna follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you follow me
The trouble seems to always wanna follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you follow me
Follow me the trouble seems to always wanna follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you follow me
The trouble seems to always wanna follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you follow me
