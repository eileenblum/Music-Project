These visions in my head
The friendly faces
I don't know maybe it's me
It feels like they're in my mind
And feasting of my brain
Uh don't you feel the same?

No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done
No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done

I'm trapped in my DNA
No time to waste
Spies are in my closet and under my bed
I'm losing this scary game
Crack me like the whip
Please crack me sane

No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done
No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done

No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done
No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done
