Never done a hard days work in your whole life
Born with a silver spoon shoved down your throat

I don't care
I don't care, no!
I don't care
I don't care about you!

So you think you're better than me
No matter how much money you got
You still bleed

I don't care
I don't care, no!
I don't care
I don't care about you!
I don't care
I don't care, no!
I don't care
I don't care about you!

Not everything is for sale
Can't buy yourself happiness

Taste it
Want it
Need it
Give me...

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the richest motherfucker of them all?

I don't care
I don't care, no!
I don't care
I don't care about you!
I don't care
I don't care, no...!
I don't care
I don't care about you!
