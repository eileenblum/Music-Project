The world is filled with desperate people
Looking with their desperate eyes
While the hollywood stars with their big fat cars
Try to get all the attention they can get

Get your bodyguard to pick up your trash
You're in the focus now
Too many drinks, crashed your cars
Can you live it up?

Feed us with scandals
Tell us who did what
You got our attention
Feed us, we're desperate

They're following every step
They'll keep you company into your grave

Stop and waving at people while you're cruising down the red carpets path
Just suck in all the flashes and pretend you care while signing away your autograph

Get your bodyguard to pick up your trash
You're in the focus now
Too many drinks, crashed your cars
Can you live it up?

Feed us with scandals
Tell us who did what
You got our attention
Feed us, we're desperate

Feed us with scandals
Tell us who did what
You got our attention
Feed us, we're desperate
