[Bonus track]

My little girl drive anywhere
Do what you want uh I don't care
Tonight I'm in the hands of fate
I hand myself over on a plate now
My little girl there are times when I feel
I rather not be the one behind the wheel
Come pull my strings
Watch me move I do anything please
You're behind the wheel tonight
Sweet little girl ooh I prefer
You behind the wheel and me the passenger
Drive I'm yours to keep
Do what you want I'm goin' cheap tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
Drive anywhere do what you want
You're behind the wheel tonight
I'm in the hands of fate
You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel
