[Bonus track]

No these visions in my head the friendly faces
I don't know maybe it's me
It feels like they're in my mind
And feasting of my brain
Ooh don't you feel the same
No one knows what I know
When I know that I'm done no no no
No one knows that I know
When I know that I'm done no
I'm trapped in my D.N.A. no time to waste
Spies are in my closet and under my bed
I'm losin' this scary game
Crack me like the whip please crack me sane
No one knows what I know
When I know that I'm done no no no
No one knows that I know
When I know that I'm done no
No one knows what I know
When I know that I'm done no no no
No one knows that I know
When I know that I'm done no no no no no no
No one knows what I know
When I know that I'm done no no no
No one knows that I know
When I know that I'm done that I'm done done
No one knows what I know
When I know that I'm done that I'm no that I'm no
No one knows that I know
When I know that I'm done done done done
