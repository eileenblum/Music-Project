I'm stressed out of my mind
I can't seem to find what's up and down
I'm frustrated and short for time
Life's a misery, won't you agree with me?

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I don't believe in that anymore

Reach out and regret
Run for your life
I feel it's pushing me to the edge

The puzzle I try to complete
Is getting short on parts and I don't know why
One step forward
Two steps back
I'm marching backwards
I'm marching on a thin line

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I don't believe in that anymore

Reach out and regret
Run for your life
I feel it's pushing me to the edge
Reach out and regret
Run for your life
The dreams you crushed, I'll never forget

Should I sweat over these things that's out of my hand
Should I really care, am I a boy or a fucking man

Should I care about the things that's out of my hand
Why is that?
I don't pretend that it doesn't bother me... no way...
