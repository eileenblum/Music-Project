All the crap I've seen and how you're running things
I'm not surprised.
You're heading for an early grave
And with a smile we lower you down

And now we see the industry's losing its grip
It's a dog eat dog world in this magical wild world of the web

Step into the game
Generation of the past
Rejected from the fame
We will see how long you'll last

Don't blame your misery on me
You're the one's out of touch
It's time to change the history
'cause you want too much

You know all the good things must come to an end
You've been riding high on your lies
And now you're going down with the burning ship

Step into the game
Generation of the past
Rejected from the fame
We will see how long you'll last

Step into the game
Generation of the past
Rejected from the fame
We will see how long you'll last

The rise of new technology
That kills the economy
It's an infectious disease
Don't blame your misery on me
You're the one that's out of touch
It's time to change the history

You know all the good things must always come to an end
We're all disposable players in the wild world of the web
Step into the game
Generation of the past
Rejected from the fame
We will see how long you'll last

Step into the game
Generation of the past
Rejected from the fame
We will see how long you'll last
