In my life I've learned a lot, don't give a helping hand
To those who keep faith in god, it's not for me to understand

Beliefs??? Is not enough what's coming out of your mouth
I always hide my thoughts, just get away from me

You're not the one
Don't push your problems on me
I'm not the one
You know I'm not your kind
You're not the one
Don't let it get to your head
I'm not the one
You know I'm not your kind

So what god say today, anyone to sacrifice?
Get your head out of your ass
Who's the next one to die

You're not the one
Don't push your problems on me
I'm not the one
You know I'm not your kind
You're not the one
Don't let it get to your head
I'm not the one
You know I'm not your kind

You're not my kind

So you think you can shove lies down my throat
I don't think you understand
I don't give a fuck about your god said so
Just stay away from me

You're not the one
Don't push your problems on me
I'm not the one
You know I'm not your kind
You're not the one
Don't let it get to your head
I'm not the one
You know I'm not your kind
