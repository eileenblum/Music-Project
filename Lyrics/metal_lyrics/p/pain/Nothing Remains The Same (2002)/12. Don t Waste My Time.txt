[Bonus Track]Hoh!

How many times do I have to clean up this mess?
You hide away and crawl up in your shell

[Chorus:]
Take a look around, can you see the word through my eyes?
Take a look around, you better not waste my time!

Can you hear me? No!
Can you see me? No! No!
Do you fear me? No! No!
And do you believe me?

Got to let you go because I canât take the pressure any more
You gotta learn how to keep both feet on the floor

[Chorus:]
Take a look around, can you see the word through my eyes?
Take a look around, you better not waste my time!
Take a look around, tell me how can you be so blind?
Take a look around, you better not waste my time!

Can you hear me? No!
Can you see me? No! No!
Do you fear me? No! No!
And do you believe me?

Take a look aroundâ¦
Takeâ¦
Take a look aroundâ¦

Donât waste my time
Take a look around
Donât waste my time
Take a look around

[Chorus:]
Take a look around, can you see the world through my eyes?
Take a look around, you better not waste my time!
Take a look around, tell me how can you be so blind?
Take a look around, you better not waste my time!

Take a look around, you better not waste my time
Take a look around, you better not waste my time
