Can't see faith through the tears of my swollen eyes
I try to dry
I pretend it's not as bad as it seems...
What a lie?

How can we be so blind
Every time a child dies?
People are starving,
Rain forests are falling,
The bombs are dropping from the sky

I don't know why it sticks in my head
I close my eyes, and it hurts me so bad
I don't know why it sticks in my head
I close my eyes, I close my eyes

I close my eyes

I look away from this misery
And I hope the problem will disappear
But it still hurts me every time a child dies

It's like a knife you stab in my heart
And twist it, twist it, twist it around

I don't know why it sticks in my head
I close my eyes, and it hurts me so bad
I don't know why it sticks in my head
I close my eyes, I close my eyes

I don't know why it sticks in my head
I close my eyes, and it hurts me so bad
I don't know why it sticks in my head
I close my eyes, I close my eyes

I close my eyes, I close my eyes [4x]
