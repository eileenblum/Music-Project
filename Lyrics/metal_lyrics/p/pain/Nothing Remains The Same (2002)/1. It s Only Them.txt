Since I was a kid I've seen greedy people
just grabbing all they could take
I promised myself I'd never become like them
I can feel they're closing up on me, closer than I ever though
how could I have beeen so dumb, didn't I see it, feel it
smell it, taste it

It's only them coming from all directions
walking all over me again and again

they're feeding of your kindness, squeezing life right out of you
like a vampire sucks you dry, you cannot run and hide
if you give them a helping hand, they will take your whole life
without thinking twice, the only thing they want is
more and more and more

now I got a parasite into my life
I didn't see it coming 'til it almost broke me down

it's only them, you don't give - you're a taker
it's a matter of the size of your wallet
and the money that you're making
it's only them and nothing is sacred
they don't care if you brake your neck
as long as they'll make it

it's only them coming from all directions walking all over me
again and again

a tattoo burned on my skin, a disease without a cure
like a blind man running in circles on a dead end street

now I got a parasite into my life
I didn't see it coming 'til it almost broke me down

it's only them, you don't give - you're a taker
it's a matter of the size of your wallet
and the money that you're making
it's only them and nothing is sacred
they don't care if you brake your neck
as long as they'll make it

ah, it's only them...
ah, it's only them...
