I'm gonna ride on my addiction tide
why don't you come and watch me die
can't get enough - you know I never get enough
I am gonna do it 'til I die
and every time I throw my face against the wall
just to know that I am alive
my mind is getting twisted and my body is getting numb
I have succeeded the ultimate rush

leaving it all behind, I need my mind to spin me around

pull me under
suck me in, spit me out, hold on tight cause I am going down
I am what the drugs make me

I am doing time in my toasted mind
crash and burn - I guess I never learn
bring me down on my knees and drag me through the dirt
got nowhere to hide

leaving it all behind, I need the drugs to spin me around

pull me under
suck me in, spit me out, hold on tight cause I am going down
I am what the drugs make me
I fall over
shut me up, throw me out, hold on tight cause I am going
down
I let the drugs help me

I don't wanna be alone
I guess I am not the only one

leaving it all behind, I need the drugs to spin me around

pull me under
suck me in, spit me out, hold on tight cause I am going down
I am what the drugs make me
I fall over
shut me up, throw me out, hold on tight cause I am going
down
I let the drugs help me

pull me under
shut me up, spit me out
I fall over

pull me under
shut me up, spit me out
I fall over
