How does it feel to get kicked when you're down and out?
I said how does it feel to get pushed off the edge and just fall
fall to the ground?

the more that you do, the less you get
why can't see you you're going down

you're on your knees, you're begging me please
can't get away from the needle's chill
you're taking a ride in endless time
injected paradise

silence rolls up like walls of noise
you're getting numb and deaf
things are getting out of control
you're out of control

the more that you do, the less you get
the poison rushing through your dying veins
the more that you take, the more you loose
time is taking its toll

you're on your knees, you're begging me please
can't get away from the needle's chill
you're taking a ride in endless time
injected paradise

the more that you do, the less you get
the poison rushing through your dying veins
the more that you take, the more you loose
time is taking its toll

you're on your knees, you're begging me please
can't get away from the needle's chill
you're taking a ride in endless time
injected paradise
