I feel you breathing down my neck, nowhere to hide
I thought I could get away but it's a good day to die

my time has come but I don't think I am ready yet
I've lost the game, I thought I played so very well

no!
I don't wanna go now
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna go
no!
I don't wanna go now
I don't wanna die, I got more to give

here I stand, the accused with a rope around my neck
just wait for the final call, I'll be gone

never got the chance to say goodbye
never got the chance to take the time to enjoy my life

no!
I don't wanna go now
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna go
no!
I don't wanna go now
I don't wanna die, I got more to give

don't take my life away now...

no! I don't wanna go now
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna go
no! I don't wanna go now
I don't wanna die, I got more to give
don't take my life away now...
