Waking up from this dream
got a feeling that something is wrong
there's blood and dead bodys everywhere
what the hell have I done?

was I walking in my sleep or is it just a conspiracy
all I know is that I am in to deep

save me
please wake me up from this dream
save me
how am I supposed to live

I lost my family, lost my job and my friends
there's nothing left for me to live in this hell

all I remember is that we said goodnight
and now my life is a living hell

save me
please wake me up from this dream
save me
how am I supposed to live
save me
please wake me up from this dream
save me
where the hell did I go wrong

where did I go wrong...

I see the picture in my dreams
will it ever stop haunting me
am I ever gonna be free
I can't erase the memory

save me
please wake me up from this dream
save me
how am I supposed to live
save me
please wake me up from this dream
save me
where the hell did I go wrong

where did I go wrong...
