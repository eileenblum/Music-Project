Use me as I use you, pull my strings
my money says that you will, that's what I pay you for
got me served on a plate, do what you want
show me that you care, you're the one in control

the harder you pull my strings, the harder I get
just a question of time before I lose my mind

it's the game that you play with my head and I can't get enough
triple sex, almost death, twisted love, the game I cannot bluff
it's the game that you play with my head and I won't get enough
can't walk away, got to play it all the way

tight up in this game, this game that I can't quit
pleasure I get in pain, the pain will keep me sane
feed my twisted mind, touch my skin with your razor blade
strip me down to the bone, I do anything

the harder you pull my strings, the harder I get
just a question of time before I lose my mind
the harder you tighten the rope, the harder I get
a slave to my burning desire, a taste of death

it's the game that you play with my head and I can't get enough
triple sex, almost death, twisted love, the game I cannot bluff
it's the game that you play with my head and I won't get enough
can't walk away, got to play it all the way
