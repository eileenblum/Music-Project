Press my face in the dirt
see how long I can hold my breath
pour some salt in my wounds
I am just someone who doesn't
fit in your world

how can I smile with your gun to my head
how can I reach out when you're holding me back
I am just so tired of everyone who's trying to save me
just save yourself...

fade away
I wanna fade away

you give me your hand, I don't want it
I'll rather drown on my own
you try to give me relief, I don't need it
I'll rather put the gun to my head

bitterness is calling inside
I am already damned
the fire in my soul is slowly dying
you know destiny calls my name

fade away
I wanna fade away
fade away
I wanna fade away
