Choked by your own lies
God blessed no one
Controlled by your brainwashed mind
A vision of salvation nowhere to be found
Your religion makes me sick
Will your god forgive you for all your sins
Mine will after I rip your fucking head off

I'm my own god
I live my life on my own term

Don't need to tell me what to do
Your whole life has been about kissing ass

Burn in paradise
There is no pearly gate
Burn in paradise

You stick your hands out, I'll cut `em off
You build it up, I'll make it fall
you wont get any sympathy from me

I'm my own god
I live my life on my own term

Your god can't help you now
Where is your salvation
There is no god

Burn in paradise
There is no pearly gate
Burn in paradise

Choke on your lies
I'm my own god
