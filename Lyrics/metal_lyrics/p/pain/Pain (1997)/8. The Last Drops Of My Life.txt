Life doesn't work out as planned
Visions of happiness are burning
Dreams that turn into madness
I feel the end is closing in

I can feel my soul leaving me
To dwell in nothing and forever disappear
Trying to breathe but there's no air
My heart is bleeding why am I here?

Taste the last drops of your life
That vanish into the black sun

I must fight this feeling
Of sorrow slowly killing me

Try to breathe but there's no air
My heart is bleeding why am I here?

Taste the last drops of your life
That vanish into the black sun

Thanks to alex_radonov for correcting track #8 lyrics.
