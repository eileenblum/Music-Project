Hangman, Is it me your looking for
I don't think I'm ready to leave
Crushed by society, I don't understand
Victim of reality, I crawl back in my shell

Nobody lives forever
Everything begins where it ends
Confusion in my own desperation
I'm the chosen one to suffer

Are you really gonna leave me crying
Are you really gonna leave me drowning
Are you really gonna leave me dying
Are you really gonna let me down

I am a perfect death
I'm on the edge
I am the freak
And no one cares

Are you really gonna leave me crying
Are you really gonna leave me drowning
Are you really gonna leave me dying
Are you really gonna let me down
