I'm going for a ride
And I hope I'll never ever get back here again
Numbing my body with drugs and lies
Try to find a place where
I can finally die

Walk with me on the other side
and i show what life is all about
The rush I get from death
It's all that eggs me to die

Every dream must die
As I try to drag you down in the dirt
Why is life worth living
When we all just life to suffer and Sacrifice
Life is like a wheel
You can run and run and you will never get there
Spinning faster then you could
Understand
You're on your knees again
You're on your knees again...
