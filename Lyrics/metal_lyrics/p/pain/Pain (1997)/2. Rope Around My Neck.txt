Trapped in a nightmare called life
With no sign of exit I am gonna die

My soul is filled with hate
Can't see through my anger
My self-confidence has been dead for years
How can I live this life

I've been destroyed a thousand times
Still try to stand tall
Don't know how long I can fight back
With the rope around my neck

You get feed of my misery
Stabbing the knife deep in my back
I can't run and hide from myself
Selfdestructive schizophrenic behaviour

Can't run away form myself
There's no way to escape
Don't know how long I can fight back
With the rope around my neck

Cutting myself wide open
Release the blood
Watch the madman float away
But not knowing it's killing me

Cutting myself wide open
Release the blood
I'm slippin' away as it's
Pumping out of my body
