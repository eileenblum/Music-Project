They have destroyed your whole life
Ever since you were born they've
Dragged you down

They have decided that you wont
Have a chance in this shitty world
not knowing what's on the outside
Can't understand right or wrong

Breathe in the poisoned air
"I just wanna die"
burning eyes filled with dead tears

The world is dying on you
And you just turning your back
not knowing what's on the outside
Poisoning our brainwashed mind
They have decided that you will die
A painful death

Breathe the death
our dying race
Breathe the death
Dying race

Breathe.....
