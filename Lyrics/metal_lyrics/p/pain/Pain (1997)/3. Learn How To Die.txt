Learn how to live
Learn how to breathe
Learn how to kill
Learn how to die

Raped by my own life
Suffocated by my own lungs
Murdered by my own hands
Dead by my own death

Stuck in my own nightmare
I can't understand
What did I do wrong
To deserve this pain

PAIN!!!!

Dealing with my own hate
all I get is pain
Shadows hunting me
All I do is freak
Insanity is getting closer now
How long can I survive
The greed I get from this world
Is sucking me dry

Learn how to live
Learn how to breathe
Learn how to kill
Learn how to die
