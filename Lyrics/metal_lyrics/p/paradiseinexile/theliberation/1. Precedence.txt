This is the way it has to be

This is my world
Here I am God
The only liberator

My chains enslave you
My reign sustains you
- This is my world and I play God
- I am the only warlord

I tower over, pulling strings
In my nowhere, my infiniteness
This is what I will become
And this is where I'll belong

Wake up fool, this is no dream
A drop of blood to tear the seam
- Placed in the palm of my hands
- Immortal mark to stain the land
- You're fucking dead, let me make myself clear
- Now swallow your fear
- Nothing can save you from here

With prying eyes I gaze below
Timing the world to only move slow
You do not know what the future holds
I wrote the script, now watch it unfold

All is not what it seems
Left hands to wake a dream
This is the way it has to be
Within what's killing me
