Suffocating in his own mind
Clouded thoughts upon another time
No knowledge or consequence
No empathy nor sense

Egotistic, Schizophrenic
For the malice that is in his mind
Malevolent psychopath

This is the way that it has to be
Narcissism a personal trait
Martyrise the desired fate

Anxiety percolates through the mind
Dissolving all that makes him see

Motive set, the path now clear
The eleventh hour is here

This is the way that it has to be

The solid state of his mind erodes
The blade set to engage

Custom to rejection,
Humiliation and violation
Become alienated
Calm and concentrated

Egotistic, Schizophrenic
Suffocating in his own mind
No serenity no sanity
For the malice that is in his mind

The killer emerges from his cold dark state
Time spent creating the illusion
But the focus is on execution
For the end is not the conclusion

Motive set, the path now clear
The eleventh hour is here
The solid state of his mind erodes
The chilling blade is set to engage

For the end is not the conclusion
