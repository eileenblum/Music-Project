There is a war inside my head
The only way out is to die
Last strands of life are dead
I will fall and face the sky

Lost within my own maze
When facing the minds eye
Deterred by blinding haze
I will fall gazing to the sky

I lead this legend into history
- Will I regret these sins
- Choking on air from the burning wind
- Corruption spreads its wings
- Shadow the sun for I'll be King

And I will stand alone
The innocent will see
Through sacrifice they assist me

Subconsciously I can see
Where it is I need to be
This fear consuming all
By which I will not fall
And I will stand alone
This world I'm left to roam

There is no fucking escape
