Poor fellow soldiers
Fearless knights of power
Slaughter and devour
We kill for our own cause
We do not feel remorse
I lead a legend creating our history
We are rising from the depths
We can see

March forward, decimate all in our way
You know by now this is the way it has to be

The highest of angels and demons curse my name
Not even God himself could ever end this reign
Defy me if you dare
I'll take your life as if it wasn't even there

Craving paths through ages
Desert of blood, the will

We held it all in our hands
Blind wind that swept the sands
Away...

We wrote it down to have it blacked out on the pages
Supremacy
Until it slipped away

I kill for my own cause
I do not feel remorse

We did not see it coming
This allegiance means nothing
Hands tied
We were burned alive
