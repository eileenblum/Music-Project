Scum of the Earth

Laying amongst the dead
I hide from my fucking end
Cold and lifeless
I shall remain for the hours
I remain
- Cover myself with the blood
- And hear the screams

No one could've guessed
A sight of pure dissension
On this picturesque
Place that we call our Eden

I turn my head to see the bodies and the blood

Eyes closed and a coldness that chills the bones
what becomes of me as I wait alone
I'm in my hell too deep
Am I waiting for help or just waiting to die?

My Paradise
My Paradise is hell
My Paradise in exile

An extinction
Of peace and unity without protection
Of what we thought
To be the guide to our salvation
Victims to the
Psychotic hands of the death campaigner
His mind too lost
To equal out with our own redemption

Will we see through the strain to escape this
Will my prayers be heard, deliverance
Freedom
- From the chains of this prison
- I dare not speak too soon

The scum of the Earth
Choosing the weak
A chance to revolt
But a coward to me

I hear the breath
The heat of the gun
I hear the footsteps
We will all die

"You all must die"

Death has brought satisfaction
To the purveyor of a waking dream
Bringing forth a perception of revolution
To end all diversity
