The blood stained on my hands
I wear with utter pride
The scent of death that fills the air
Is so divine
Sorrow, an enemy
Within my blackened soul
Remorse, not welcome
Cold and alone

There is no remorse in my mind
I have ascended through time
A bloodline of chaos
Is all you'll find
This form of liberation
Brought on extermination

The knights before me have reigned
Through me, thunder was made
Summon clouds to block the sun
Light will be spared for none

And this is just the beginning
The cold inspires the flooding
For I have brought balance to this world

I have destroyed ill vision
I have engraved my name
The efforts for the childrens bloodshed
Have not been in vain
The deaths have brought fruition
My horror has unfurled
You will soon see
I have brought balance to this world
