The apocalypse begins!
With the last serenade, for humanity!
With the mark of the beast, on the ground,
evacuations started, sirens sound.
When the black skies, turn red,
heâs come to raise, the dead!

I AM LEGION, FOR I AM MANY!

ERADICATE THEIR FAITH!
ERADICATE THEIR FAITH!
ERADICATE THEIR FAITH!
EXTERMINATE THE HUMANWASTE!

The gates have opened,
Satan's reign has begun!
The eclipse started,
the moon blocking out the sun!
His demons roam the earth,
pestilence is here!
They hide from the beast,
but he smells their fear!

The time has come for humanity to end,
The end is nigh and itâs time to repent.
The time has come for humanity to end,
The end is nigh and itâs time to repent.

The world has been cleansed, of the human plague,
Eaten by pestilence this world was raped.
Whatâs left of civilization has been evacuated.
The humanwaste have been exterminated!

PRAY TO YOUR FUCKING GOD,
But he will never answer!
PRAY TO YOUR FUCKING GOD,
But he will never answer!

He will claim the throne,
He will end this world.
He will claim the throne,
He will end this world!

LAY THEM TO WASTE!

Destroy them all!
Exterminate the humanwaste!
Destroy them all!
Exterminate the human race!
