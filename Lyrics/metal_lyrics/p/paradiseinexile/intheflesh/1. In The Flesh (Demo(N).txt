[Sample: The Exorcism of Emily Rose][Father Moore:]
Tell me your name, wicked one.

[Emily Rose:]
Eins, zwei, drei, veir, funf, sechs

[Father Moore:]
He who commands you is he
Who ordered you thrown down
From the highest heaven
Into the depths of hell.
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
I now command you:
Tell me your name!

[Emily Rose:]
Eins, zwei, drei, veir, funf, sechs

[Father Moore:]
Hear, therefore, and fear,
Satan, enemy of the faith.
Give me your name, demon!

[Emily Rose:]
Names!
Names!
[Inaudible]

[Father Moore:]
Ancient serpents
Depart from this servant of God!
Tell me your six names!

[Emily Rose:]
We are the ones who dwell within!
[In Hebrew] I am the one who dwelt within CAIN!
[In Latin] I am the one who dwelt within NERO!
[In Greek] I once dwelt within JUDAS!
[In German] I was with Legion!
[In Assyrian Neo-Aramaic] I am Belial!
And I am Lucifer the devil in the flesh.
[Nemesis:] THE DEVIL IN THE FLESH
