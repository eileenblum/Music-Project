WHEN THE WOLVES WERE LEFT TO ROAM!
Post apocalypse, nothings left, bodies line the streets.
God is dead, our master rules, the human race is weak.

We hunt down and kill, what's left of human kind, let the wolves reign high!
We hunt in packs, stalking, slaughtering all mankind; weâll eat your flesh from the bone!
We hunt in packs, stalking, slaughtering all mankind; weâll eat your flesh from the bone!
We hunt in packs, killing, slaying all humankind, when the wolves are left to roam!

Satanic, sacrifice, upon these pathetic, pitiful creatures,
Cannibalistic, pleasure, as I gorge myself, on human flesh.

Devouring, human life!
Destroying the innocent left and right.
Devouring, human life!
Destroying the innocent left and right.

WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!
WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!
WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!
WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!

We feel nothing, but hunger, as we silently, stalk our prey,
Through the rotten city, we begin, the chase.
We feel nothing, but hatred, as we rend the humanâs, limb from limb,
Crunching bone, blood dripping, from myâ¦ face.

I love to feel the metallic taste of blood.
I love to watch the bowels hit the floor.
I love to hear the crunching of the bones.
I love to howl as if screaming for more!

Upon the full moons ascent, my heart starts racing,
senses heighten, my whole bodyâs aching.
The change is over as quickly as it started,
hair covered body, jaws are lashing, my human form parted.
We are Satans, children of the night.
designed to devour, human life.
This is lycanthropy, Iâll tear you apartâ¦

LIMB, FROM, FUCKING, LIMB!

WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!
WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!
WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!
WHEN THE WOLVES ARE LEFT TO ROAM!
