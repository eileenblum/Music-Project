Here I stand not afraid
Facing life another day
Trying to keep the calm again
Is it all in vain?

Lose control of my mind
When you've left all behind
Dying in lies every time
No one saves me now

I know the road is too long now
It's time to run away from here

Walking straight to the light
I was searching for a sign
Demons roaming on my mind
All these times again

Drown my tears, no regrets
Hold the poison of despair
Tasting all that I have lost
When will this be gone?

I know the road is too long now
The time has come to fly away

No one can save me
Deep in the abyss
This time I fall
I wasted my time

I try to fight it
Doomed in the darkness
Out of control
I Spiral down

Out of control!
I wasted my time!

I know the road is too long now
The time has come to fly away

No one can save me
Deep in the abyss
This time I fall
I wasted my time

I try to fight it
Doomed in the darkness
Out of control
I spiral down

I know the road is too long now
The time has come to fly away

No one can save me
Deep in the abyss
This time I fall
I wasted my time

I try to fight it
Doomed in the darkness
Out of control
I spiral down
