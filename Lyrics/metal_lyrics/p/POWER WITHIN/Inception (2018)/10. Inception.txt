Echoes of better times
Memories from the past
Unleashed emotions
The inception of life

It's all crumbling down
My mind is a puzzle
I must face this pain
This endless regret

No one can
Save me now

To set my mind free
From the prison I'm in

No one will
Help me out
This time!

Looking for the right thing
I search so deep inside
Internal struggles
Destroying my mind

Wrapped in distress
There's still left some hope
I'm facing myself
I'll fight till the end

No one will
Help me out

To set my mind free
From the prison I'm in
To take back control
To make my life go on!

The darkness is lurking
I see no way out!
It's pushing my limits
it's dragging me down!

A slim glimpse of hope
Is rising now from within
I feel all the power
I can breath again

A new time has come
To never look back again
This doom is now fading
And I'm not afraid

Fear is gone
I'll prevail

To set my mind free
From the chains of the past
To take back control
To make my life go on!
