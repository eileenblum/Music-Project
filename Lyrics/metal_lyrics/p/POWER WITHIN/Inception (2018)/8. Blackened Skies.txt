I take my sword
It's time for battle
The darkness knights
Are coming to take over

We will not die tonight
I raise my shield and scream so loud
My troops attack with pride
It's time for glory

Arrows from hell are falling
My loyal friend has fallen
The endless clash is coming
To make our final stand

There's no way back
From this slaughter
The light of hope
It's vanishing into the night

Fire and red skies
I see life flashing through my eyes
Onwards we go
The execution has begun

Arrows from hell are falling
My loyal friend has fallen
The endless clash is coming
To make our final stand

Blackened skies, and misery
Is what this war brought us
Sacrificed, my entire life
In quest for a free, new dawn

Arrows from hell are falling
My loyal friend has fallen
The endless clash is coming
To make our final stand

Blackened skies, and misery
Is what this war brought us
Sacrificed, my entire life
In quest for a free, new dawn
