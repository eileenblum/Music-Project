Running to survive
Praying for a sign
We all want to live
No one wants to fight

No one understands
That the price is high
If we leave alone
The agonizing world

Crossing the threshold
We're under the fire from the skies
Our land's burning down

Saving the nature
It's our destination in our hands
It's the time to survive!

Earthquakes in the north
South is full of storms
Starving all around
There's no turning back

West is crumbling down
East is bleeding out
God just went away
Leaving us in hell

Crossing the threshold
We're under the fire from the skies
Our land's burning down

Saving the nature
It's our destination in our hands
It's the time to survive!
