Walking through these fields of glory
Bloodshed of the ancient past
Men were killed for power and desire

Tombstone legends, epic battles
War for every piece of land
Memories are coming to my mind

Someday we will fly I swear
Like the phoenix from the ashes
We will rise again

Blazing thunder, clash of titans
Machine guns, artillery
Rising power bombing from the skies

The world has been destroyed again
All because of greedy men
Killing fields with our brothers on the ground

Someday we will fly I swear
Like the phoenix from the ashes
We will rise again

We'll heal the wounds this time
We faced it together!
We stand as one today
We'll never surrender!

Someday we will fly I swear
Like the phoenix from the ashes
We will rise again
Yeah!
