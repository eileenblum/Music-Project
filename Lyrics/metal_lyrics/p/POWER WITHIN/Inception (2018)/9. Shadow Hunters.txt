That night I was calling you
Turn on the lights to feel the real life
Once more we've been through this before
Begging for the so called love that you said we had

Hunters of dark shadows
Are coming to my mind
They show me the worst part
Of giving all and nothing's back

Hunters of dark shadows
Are coming to my mind
They show me the worst part
Of giving all and nothing's back!

This time I'll be over you
I don't want to be the same
I'm so tired of begging you
There is nothing left to say

I believed in love again
You fooled me what a mistake
With your pretty masquerade
Now it's me who walks away

Hunters of dark shadows
Are coming to my mind
They show me the worst part
Of giving all and nothing's back

Hunters of dark shadows
Are coming to my mind
They show me the worst part
Of giving all and nothing's back!

So tell me what I've done
For you to give me this hell I've been through
It's never good enough
All I ever do to please the whore in you

Now you come back to me
I'm hearing the words you've said many times before

It is all over now
I don't want to hear you
Never see you
Never feel you
And here you are again!

Hunters of dark shadows
Are coming to my mind
They show me the worst part
Of giving all and nothing's back

Hunters of dark shadows
Are coming to my mind
They show me the worst part
Of giving all and nothing's back!
