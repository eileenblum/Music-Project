If we could find a new horizon
For our nation's pride
The system's failed and chaos
Is reigning all around

Corruption
Destruction
Our leaders don't want you to think

Disruption
Abduction
Of our peace and lawful rights

Together we as one are strong
Divided is all what they want

They've hurt us
They've robbed us
They want you to believe in them

We're puppets
Blindfolded
Open up your eyes and see the truth

Together we as one are strong
Divided is all what they want

We have to stop this madness
Take back power
To restore control

We are the ones who choose
To build our future
And a brand new world

A brand new world!

Together we as one are strong
Divided is all what they want

We have to stop this madness
Take back power
To restore control

We are the ones who choose
To build our future
And a brand new world!
