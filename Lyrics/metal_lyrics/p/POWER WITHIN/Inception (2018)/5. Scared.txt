You were always shining on my way
And I still have many things to say
The light of your soul fades away
I'm just holding on so please stay

I don't want to carry on
I'm so scared

I believed when you said
"I'll never go away"
But I felt it deep inside.

It's a road so full of pain
An uncertain and uncolored place
Even if you think you're strong
You always pay the highest toll

I don't want to carry on
I'm so scared

Hold my hand we'll fly away
And stay with me
Just don't leave me

It won't matter where you go
You'll always be my home
This won't be our last good bye
We'll meet my love someday

I don't want to carry on
I'm so scared

Hold my hand we'll fly away
And stay with me
Just don't leave me

I believed when you said
"I'll never go away"
But I felt it deep inside
