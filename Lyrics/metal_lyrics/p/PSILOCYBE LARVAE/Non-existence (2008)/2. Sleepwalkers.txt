Let's hide under the veil
Of non-existence
There is nothing other than
Our dreams
Let's rush into the
Violent tempest
Where rainstorm
Will free our mind

Cloaked in lunar silk
Walks the lunatic

We live inside a dream
And in every breath
We try to catch the wind
And disappear

Cloaked in lunar silk
Walks the lunatic

Our souls are given life by the night
Where every instant is everlasting
Our hearts are filled with an orphan moonlight
Where every instant approaches the everlasting

We live inside a dream
And in every breath
We try to catch the wind
And disappear
