You see the words
are turning to nothing
You see our daydreams
have become a nightmare
Castaway... you burn again
You know how many souls
have fallen into chasm
The silent look of cold graves
impales your eyes

And you're trying to understand
To touch the dust by hand

Do you see the demon in the mirror?
Does it make you remember anything?
You hope you never see it
Outside the dream

And you don't want to see that dream
But it's more than real
The dream must continue
