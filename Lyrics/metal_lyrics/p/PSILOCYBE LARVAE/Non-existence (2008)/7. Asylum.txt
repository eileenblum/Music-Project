Slumber fury that's hidden inside
Has possessed me and confused my mind
Evil... beware the demon inside
Evil... overcome the demon inside
Eyes of beholder never sleep
The watcher is following in the step
Goodness, your garden is desolate
Goodness, my soul is desolate

Dreams giving life to the dark
Waiting to be unleashed

There is someone in my head
Living and controlling my movement

I've got away to my asylum
