We live awaiting death
We die awaiting life

We're blind and only feel
Cold breath of funeral wind
The silent whisper of truth
Will never be heard and understood
Hiding the sinful frenzy
Under the mask of piety
To kneel, to pray
To touch your scares again

Weep over the wounds of your Lord
Mortify the flesh, give him your blood

Let the flame purify our bane

Through the tangled corridors of life
We run to the trap
With hope to see the light
