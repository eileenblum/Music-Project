I roam in insane alarm
I languish for morbid wait

Night changes the day
And spreads the wings
There is my mournful way
The world where I'm confined
Empire of solitude
Keeps my condemnation
In times when I was seeking madness
In times when I was begging for a threat
Forgotten happiness
And sadness over past years
Empire of solitude
Keeps my condemnation
