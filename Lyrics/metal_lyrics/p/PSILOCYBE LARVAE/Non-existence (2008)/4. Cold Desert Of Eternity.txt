Cold desert of eternity looks at my reality
Infinite space of dying word expands its shores

Frozen steel of heaven's spear will pierce our fragile sphere

Exterminate

I'm silent wind that blows the sand of life
I'm trying to find concealed light
To enter the door that leads to a voids
To see eternity in my lonely tomb
