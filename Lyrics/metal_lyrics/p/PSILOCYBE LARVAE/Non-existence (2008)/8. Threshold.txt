Things get out of control
Until you fall asleep
(But) You will never be saved
In your illusory world

Could you see the sky
Through the dust of life
Could you hear the echo
Of fading light

Let the spirit take your soul away

Just look inside yourself
And go beyond
Find inner peace
Cross the threshold

Let the spirit take your soul away

Remember the sun
You're waiting for to come

One instant, one touch
Weightless ghost is calling us
