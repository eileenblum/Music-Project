I weakly flow in infinity
Of reverie
To disappear like morning mist

Rolling over dark brink
How does it feel
To be broken?
Aspire to endless fall
All - never to return!

Great silence! I feel your breath
I know that death
Is creeping near

And I fall again
And my light is dying away

Great silence! I wait for a blink
To dissolve into your realm
Of placidity
