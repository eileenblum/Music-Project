Dying sun reflects in empty space
I'm standing here in the strangest place

I see the avatar
Vested in sun
My shambhala
Will always shine

The target for laughing death
The enemy of myself
My silent double
Laid hold of shadow

I see the avatar
Vested in sun
My shambhala
Will always shine

I take a step towards the end of a journey

Stabbing stream of consciousness
Triggers my deliverance

Every time I die and resurrect again
On a way to unexplored secret land

Stabbing stream of consciousness
Triggers my deliverance
