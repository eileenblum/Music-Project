Throw up a window
Hold your breath
Come down to the river
Of your remembrance

Peer into the boundless deep
And try to see

It'll ease the pain and bring the rest
Come in and touch cold waves
Let the stream take you away to the past
And you'll take life in gently hands

Yes, the river knows
It hears your panic voice

It eases the pain but it always comes again
Poison in your veins is flowing out
Join the reality in death embrace
You know it doesn't even hurt anymore
