Up and down
Replace the picture view
Fast to the ground
And slowly disappear

I've got a secret
I've caught your dream
And link invisible tie
Through a thousand years

I fell and I fly up out of the dark

Up and down
Keep breathing, wait
I hope a haunting will never be gone
And show me a secret way

I fell and I fly up out of the dark

There is somewhere a heaven ship.
Drifting through the raging storm
It's seeking fate in a lonely shore.
Its final battle has come.

A mysterious sound
Will fill your ears again
Never-ending cry that's grown inside
Break the silence of human mind
