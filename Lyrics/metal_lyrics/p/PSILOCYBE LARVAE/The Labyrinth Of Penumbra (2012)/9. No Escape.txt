Do you feel the ecstasy
When escaping reality?
Open your eyes and mind
Run, run to the other side.

Hold on to a thin subtle thread
When it seems there is no escape
And the solution to our problems
Is suicide...

Descending light illuminated
Once-living sight

Queer perception of deep immersion
Into ethereal shell

Insights buried in haze
Keep hidden away

The vast of heaven,
Last twinkle and morphing is completed
