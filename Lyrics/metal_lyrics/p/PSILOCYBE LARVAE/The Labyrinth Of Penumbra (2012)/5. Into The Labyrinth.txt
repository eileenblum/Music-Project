I walk alongside of a shapeless shadow
Who could let me see the light and show the parole?
Invisible patrol keeps all exits out
The labyrinth looks at me from every quarter

I see endless gallery of broken dreams and masks
Without life they are empty inside
Deformed by savage might
That living in the depth of mind

Everyone believe, one day he'll be out of the labyrinth

The door is closed for a look
A delve is set around
The only thing that is left to do
Is groping in the labyrinth (from out to out)
