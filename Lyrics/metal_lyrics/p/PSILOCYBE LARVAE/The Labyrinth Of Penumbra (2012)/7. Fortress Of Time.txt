It's been a long time
Since we've been rolling
Lifelike, adrift,
Seeking sanctuary

Killing, crashing, devastating
All that's living there
Always trying again
To besiege an impregnable fortress of time

Look back at your
Abandoned home
Where time is slowing down
And let you stay alone

Killing, crashing, devastating
All that's living there
Always trying again
To besiege an impregnable fortress of time

Bring the sacrifice
Set your life on fire
