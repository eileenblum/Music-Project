When life once lost and fouled the trail
Dark angel will show you a path that leads to hell.

Our past and future are in circle of the infinite
Oblivion wrapped our lonely spirits

Erase the completely wrecked mind
To pick splinters of a mosaic

Rejected soul is the dust of the earth

Come around to the temple of Fate
Leave the past behind, follow the light out

Our past and future are in circle of the infinite
Oblivion wrapped our lonely spirits

The soul trekking is coming to an end

...you can't stop the run-down clocks
