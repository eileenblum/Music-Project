I stay in the dark and watch another day die
I go down in flames and get overcomed by satori

And I live to fight another day
In order to incinerate again

I saw the one who wore all habits and all shapes
Shifting and transcending far beyond a sense

And I live to fight another day
In order to incinerate again

Trial by fire, trial by fire

Things lose familiar sight
And turn into the glimpse of light
Formed out of the ashes
Will flesh out and break the bounds of the world
