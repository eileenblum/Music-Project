Curtain of Darkness
Final Occurence
Life is out there
Madness is coming
it will fill our heart and our mind
Too late to open the doors
to the garden of Eden
Saints are crying
they're powerless
Soul is dying
it's revenge
Remembrance and Pain
it's all that you have
Your prayer unheard
and beast awaken
This is a revenge of angels
Remembrance and Pain
it's all that you have
Your prayer unheard
and beast awaken
This is a revenge of angels
