Illusion of Heaven
Deadens the Pain
Stigmata of Soul
Is burning again
Let's taste
Divine blood
Your sinful eyes
Will see the Light
Stigmata of Soul
Torturing must go on
Godlike sign
Obtained your mind
Repeat the prayer
You're crucified
Crown of Thorns
Will stick into your head
Pungent nails
Will pierce your hands
