Ride through the night
Not to touch the light
To scattered sky
Towards mighty darkest sun

Don't wait
Till you scared?
Run away

Darkest sun
Won't you come
Quiet and silent
Unchaining souls and
Letting 'em die

There is not enough time
To find yourself
There is not enough faith
To save yourself

Rejoice the down of Age
Feel the sacred strength
It's coming
It's coming
