I'm living I'm dying
In damned world
Jesus, Satan
They're tearing my soul

Who are you? Who's staying on my way
Are you my fear or my pain?

Out of Sanity
Out of Sanity
Out of Sanity
Out of Sanity

Fear of human
Like a cure
Acting slowly

Insensible
Like a poison
Killing strongly

Out of Sanity
Out of Sanity
Out of Sanity
Out of Sanity

Insanity
Let me survive
Sear me
My pain will be mine
