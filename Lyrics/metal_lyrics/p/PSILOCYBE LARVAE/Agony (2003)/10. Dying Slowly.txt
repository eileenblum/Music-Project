We're dying slowly
Day by day
Were we're going
So dim this way
Won't you remember
What you have done
When life
Is gone

I'm not afraid of the
World beyond
No one gets
My soul
Step by step
Towards the End
We will never change
The fatal thread

What does the future
Hold for me
Only
Obscurity

I'm not afraid of the
World beyond
No one gets
My soul

It's just a dream
That really kills
