Attraction of abyss
I'll never be back again
Through oceans of time
I feel my agony

There is no choice
Between life and death
And distant voice
Is calling down to earth

Agony

I've left myself and fear is gone
I've seen the world that has not come
I've torn the wings and learned to fly
I've been to the dark side

I know that days of grief
Are going to turn to leaves
As them we gotta fall away
And disappeared

Doomed soul is tired
Chaos in caverns of mind
Is that the deadline?

Agony! I've tried
To deceive my life
But the circle is closed now
