The time is near
You are not here
Blinded eyes
Blame the skies

Lying world
Full of scorn
Will be devoured
By its void

Black horsemen of Apocalypse
Like shadows
Will bring deliverance

Justified... Crucified

Angels seem far away
They've just left their domain
Only death makes you clean
Everything else is unreal
