[music: Payne/Palms, lyrics: Payne]

What are they thinking?
I can't took them in the eye
My confidence is sinking
We all know what happened in July
Imagine me as a higher being
Imagine all the broken pieces I could mend
And eventhough I'm dreaming now
Real is the love from me I'll send out to you...]
