[music: Payne/Palms, lyrics: Payne]

Leave me alone, but I do need some company dear
Oh please don't leave home, don't really mean what I'm saying here
The outside may look okay, not all of it was hell,
My biggest wish and fear is to forever drift and dwell
Leave me alone, let's pretend that we're not here,
Oh please don't leave home, wouldn't it be great to disappear
Leave me alone don't leave me alone, &amp; will I ever know?
All the pressures I feel
They're building up around me
I hope you'll never feel this aching pain inside
