[music: Payne/Palms, lyrics: Payne]

I hope, oh baby
that you'll became a lady
And please do, baby
Just hang in there &amp; become amazing
I hope, oh baby
For openness, no nothing hazy
And listen, baby
I hope you know that I'm still here
Never lose hope, oh anybody
Never lose hope, oh baby
Never lose hope, oh anybody
Remember, there's still a maybe
There's always a maybe
There's always a maybe
Maybe?
