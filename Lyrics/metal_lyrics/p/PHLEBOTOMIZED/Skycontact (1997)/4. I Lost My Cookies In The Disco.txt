[music: Payne/Palms, lyrics: Payne/Geestman]

I'm off to an island of my dreams...
Far away from home, with nobody else but me
Peaceful &amp; all alone, surrounded by a blue
I'm off to build a raft for me...
Just let me be free, peaceful &amp; all alone
Just let me be me, far away from home
Why...do I feel...
...that this life wasn't really meant for me?
Try... to become...
...a person, someone else, the opposite of me
So... I'll try to escape...
...this world with it's so-called possibilities
And then... I'll sail away...
...to leave it all behind, don't follow me, please
Why...should all the soil...
...we have, be deadend by lifeless concrete?
...the grip on this evergrowing, urban disease
So...it won't take long...
...before the last drop of water turns black in
these seas
And then... I'll sail away...
...to leave it all behind, don't follow me, please
