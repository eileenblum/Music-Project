Monks pledge for silence
To never speak another word
Sacrifice for their master
Decades of silence
Expulsion from the actual word
Monotonousness fills their lives

Solemnly swear the oath
And cast thy soul to a fourth dimension
Upon it will eternally drift
Ceaseless, without purpose
Undefinable space
In sinister blackness
All is worship of god
Which equals the worship of satan
Drift among billions
Whom's fate was left in gods hands

Sequence thy mind to superstition
Switched to a helpless mode
To keep thee from seclusion

Praise the lord, time and time
Happiness he'll hope to incline

Sequence thy mind to superstition
Switched to a helpless mode
For it is heaven's deadly solution

Transcendent leaps down from above
Expelling hatred, exchanged is love?

Monks pledge for silence
To never speak another word
Sacrifice for their master
Decades of silence
Expulsion from the actual word
Monotonousness fills their lives
