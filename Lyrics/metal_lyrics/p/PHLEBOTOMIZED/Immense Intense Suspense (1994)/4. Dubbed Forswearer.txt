Outlook on life manifests it's self [2x]

Grievance... the cause of this
Life of lies... my happiness
Unlocking doors... with symbolic keys
Entering... an unknown entity
Swaying... between two worlds
Fantasy... (I'm) about to be swirled
Green, green grass... upon I lay
Oh daydream... please lead me the way!!!

All I wish that I'll march
Eagerness messed up my mind
I'll try to get my act together
Leaving the past way far behind

I build my castles in the air [2x]

This is a tale of an unfledged utopia
Fantasies of being a figure of illustriousness
In actuality one lacks refinement
Perceiving mere remnants of utter worthlessness

Dubbed forswearer... outlook on life manifests it's self
Dubbed forswearer... I build my castles in the air
Dubbed forswearer... outlook on life manifests it's self
Dubbed forswearer... I build my castles in the air

[Repeat 2 + 6]
