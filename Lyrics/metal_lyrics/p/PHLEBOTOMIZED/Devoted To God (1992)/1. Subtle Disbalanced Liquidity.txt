Subtle disbalanced liquidity [2x]

Subtle disbalanced liquidity
I was sure to be set at ease
Instead of relieving me from my pains
A sense, a shred of my imagination involved

In therapeutical treatment
Suggestibility is used
By calling upon my symptoms in trance
Dislodge my repressed fears
Expel vexatious traumas
Drown now in my suggestive resistance

Not based on a mere physiological process
The state in which I now drop into
Here is where I am unobstructed
Nor beheld from access
Subconsciousness is my aspiration

Subtle disbalanced liquidity
The cure was within I reach
Some problems seemed to fade away
But the malignant sickness is here
Which tends to stay

Not based on a mere physiological process
The state in which I now drop into
Here is where I am unobstructed
Nor beheld from access
Subconsciousness is my aspiration

Subtle disbalanced liquidity [2x]

Take my opinion as a advise
The only way to loose this miraculousness
Is not the responsibility of a psychologist
It is also the will of the mind

Subtle disbalanced liquidity [2x]
