Monks pledge for silence
To never speak another word
Sacrifice for their master
Decades of silence
Expulsion from the actual world
Monotonousness fills their lives

Solemny swear the oath
And cast thy soul to a fourth dimension
Upon it will eternally drift
Ceaseless, without purpose
Undifinable space, in sinister blackness
All is worship of God.
Which equals the worship of Satan
Drift among billions
Whom's fate was left in God's hands

Sequence thy mind to superstition
Switched to a helpless mode
To keep thee from seclusion

Praise the Lord, time and time
Happiness he'll hope to incline

Sequence thy mind to superstition
Switched to a helpless mode
To keep thee from seclusion

Transcendant leaps down from above
Expelling hatred, exchangement is love?

Monks pledge for silence
To never speak another word
Sacrifice for their master
Decades of silence
Expulsion from the actual world
Monotonousness fills their lives
