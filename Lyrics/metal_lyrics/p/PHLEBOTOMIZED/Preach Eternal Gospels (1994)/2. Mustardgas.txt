[2C2H4 + S2Cl2 - C4H8Cl2 + S]

Introduced as weapon during World War I
Both used by Allies and Germany
Among the chocking chlorine and phosgene
Was the blinding mustardgas, it's colour yellow-green

Unreliable weapons, primitive minds,
rebounding the attacker, primitive times
Throw another one into air,
hould the course alter would be fair?
The experience is felt, gasmasks for air,
down in the trenches the dead are the bare
Patriotic pride stop at nothing,
dying to see the opponent suffering

Introduced as weapon during World War I
Both used by Allies and Germany

Unreliable weapons, primitive minds,
rebounding the attacker, primitive times
Patriotic pride stop at nothing,
dying to see the opponent suffering

Die, in a confrontation, as it comes down
You will never see the light of this declining world again

Die, by the gas, as it comes down
You will never see the light... you're dead

Ypres, Verdun, Somme &amp; Passchendael,
these were the places battles dwelled
Gunnery rumbling, gloomy expressions,
plunging thousands into depression
