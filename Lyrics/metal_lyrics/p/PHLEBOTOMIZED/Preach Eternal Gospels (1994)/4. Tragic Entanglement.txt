Eight gleaming eyes, from behind
Sence a presence, so vulnerable, so eminent to paralyze
Petrified victims, spunned alive
Punctured by jaws ferociously, consumed till satisfied

Fluids flow from remains, splash down beyond
As acids from these foul - oudererd pond
Brutal voracity, phlegmatic glance
Hunger increased, prepared for a feast

Tragic entanglement, trapped in a substance, known as a webb
Tragic entanglement, once felt by vibration, witness the dread

As an apologetic puppet on a string
Helpless and so pathetically
Frozen by a sarcastic grin
The predator overpowers thee

Become weary of the situation
Become weary and face the fear
Fear transformed into death

Phlebotomized by an insect
Sucked till evisceration
Succulence around the mouth
As it delves into your flesh
Inaudibly it creeps away again
In awaitence of prey...

Tragic entanglement, trapped in a substance, known as a webb
Tragic entanglement, once felt by vibration, witness the dread

Eight gleaming eyes, from behind
Sence a presence, so vulnerable, so eminent to paralyze
Petrified victims, spunned alive
Punctured by jaws ferociously, consumed till satisfied

Fluids flow from remains, splash down beyond
As acids from these foul - oudererd pond
Brutal voracity, phlegmatic glance
Hunger increased, prepared for a feast
