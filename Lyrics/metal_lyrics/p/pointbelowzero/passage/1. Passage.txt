I am alive
But nothing I do, can make me come to terms
With where I am now
Fever and dark surround me
Am I breathing?
I am blind

Hopelessly out stretched, my hands like feelers
Gripping textures, captivating all that confines me
I canât tell where I am, all of my senses are passive
A numb blindness, dulling my mind once again

Something grips me with cold and foreign hands
Pushing forward, enticing me to abstain
From all thatâs unknown, a darkened path before lies
This persuasive entity is all that I have left

Weak is but my morale
My carnal sense is to push on
I must continue
By unity I am now bound

What has forced me to move ahead?

The entity humanistic in itâs touch
A force pushing forward driving me to the depths
â¨Desolate passages, leading to death
Instinctively I am drawn to the unkown

This passage barren
Ahead the only way out
The stench of death leads
The path confining me to my despair

Terror, dismay grip me tight
Pure torment, faithless, I am forlorn

But by unity I am bound

Common is what I am, now that Iâm broken
I am nothing but victim to this soul less passage.
