This is pure devastation
A life thatâs taken quick and left us with prosthetic limbs and benumbed hands
Fall in the lake
The lake of darkest depths
A sea of peril that never lets go

A young life
A life of promises and beauty
That would show, just show your might
A life thatâs torn apart by reasons unknown

This is your journey
You just left and now youâre on your way
Pushed by returning feelings of helplessness and pain
So, so soon
We will miss you lover, friend, sister and daughter
Cruelty of minds plague
Infects your life and all
To rip apart this life uncertain

In this cold world we see before our eyes
Portrayed through, all her thoughts
You leave us know you bastard

Disease you have no lover
I wish you would just leave us be
To return to life
Keep living like we should
No suicide is justified
This torment before us
Why canât you just leave us alone
And never return
To sink in your fangs, to sink in your teeth
You wretched destroyer

This is pure devastation
A life thatâs taken quick and left us with prosthetic limbs and benumbed hands
You will be missed.
