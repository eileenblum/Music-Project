What is it that youâre saying?
I cannot see this faith, that is so fakely portrayed
My mind ticks over as your lips move
But as Iâm sick all I hear are screams of pain

My mind is gone, but murderous thoughts still rampage my brain
I see death with a third eye, itâs like a track on repeat.
You try to preach to me?
I rip that fucking cross from your neck
You worthless heathen.

As I begin to stab you with what you call your god
A chuckle comes to me, thereâs nothing like irony.
Oh no mercy shown here, not like your fucking symbol
No faith will save you now.
I am the devil himself, just say a fucking prayer
So I can spit in your face.
Spit in your face!

Protect me! From my sins
What a joke! Your fucking blind faith.

Your martyrism, is it supposed to impress me?
Youâre not dying for a god, youâre just dying by my hands!
Thereâs no one waiting for you up there.
Keep that glint in your eye, itâs pathetic.
You fucking worm!
Death is the end, no one will save you now.

From my bonesaw scraping, my upside down crucifix maiming
Your skin is peeling from my effigy
A model of the stupidity of your sacrifice
A model of the stupidity of your sacrifice.

Your witch heâs not real, how many times must I dismiss this blind facade?
You are a legion of stupidity, I cannot stand by any longer.
I must end your strangle.
Your strangle
Your strangle on humanity
Your stranglehold,
I must end it.
