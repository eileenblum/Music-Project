If you could see
Through my eyes
The things Iâve done
Throughout my life
But you keep trying to be like me
You're a cheap imitation
Get off that trip
Take your place now
Where were you on the first day?
You know deep inside
That you would be worthless on your own
I am the teacher
You learn from me
Come now, son
This is your final lesson

[Chorus]
Where were you on day one?
I never saw your face on day one
Remember where you came from?
It is easy to forget
Were you there on day one?
I never saw your face on day one
Leaving you behind son
Your mask is off forever

Throughout the years
I learned to ignore your kind more
You seem to open up hostilities
You opened up
You opened up life's fucking door to hate
It's useless trying to be like me
Fall to the possibilities
That the single minded find
Erupt from beneath this obedience
Somehow appease that swallow, subordinate mind
What really makes you think?
That your face is fooling anyone of us
What really makes you think?
That your life, constructed on a lie
To be a shallow, spineless waste
Spineless
I am the teacher
You learn from me
Come now son
This is your final lesson
I am your great mentor
The reason why you breathe
I am your only true inspiration

[Repeat chorus]
