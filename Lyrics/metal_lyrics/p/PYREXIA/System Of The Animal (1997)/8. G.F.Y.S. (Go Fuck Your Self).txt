You stand so tall in your arrogance
Your nose held high
Your heads rising into the air
You're so blind you're slowly drowning in yourself
This god-like attitude
Is becoming way too much for me to bear
You think you're some gift to humanity
Some kind of fucking prize
That should bring us down to our knees
The time will come
Reality will cut you down
Put you in your place
You'll always be a punk

[Sub-chorus]
A self-centered, egoistical
Self righteous little prick you persist to be!
The hammer of discipline coming down
Will make you see
I'll make you pay for the years of misery!
You're no god!
Mean absolutely nothing to me
You waste of space, why don't you go fuck yourself
I have no time to deal with your stupidity
In time comes revenge
So go fuck yourself!

Pleading to me the shoe's on the other foot
Now I'm on your top, your face underneath my boot
Brought down, experience this humility
Look who's laughing now, ha...
Where did it get you punk?
You think you're some gift to humanity
Some kind of fucking prize
That should bring us down to our knees
The time will come
Reality will cut you down
Put you in your place
You'll always be a punk

[Repeat sub-chorus]

How do I wait...
To see the day you fall
False dreams
How do I wait...
To see the day you bleed
In time comes revenge
We get just deserved
In time comes revenge
We get respect
