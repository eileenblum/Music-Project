Farrakhan
You repulse me
Racist
Confrontation
Speaking your words of piece with our enemies
Lying bastard
Lead the innocent with hopes of unity
Separatist
Separate the masses
Divide the populace
You... Keep feeding a fire that is already out of control
What does your faith think?
Do they condone your treachery?
This cannot be
What gave you the right
The right to speak for me?
You talk down on the motherland
Blood stained money crossing hands
Allied with the devil
To infiltrate us silently: chipping away at social infrastructure
Eroding confidence where progress can be seen
Continually re-igniting a diatribe
An atrocity that's been dead for nearly a century
Your life is filled with greed
Articles of faith, the seed of blind salvation
Impostor to Luther King, man with the true views
Entice the commonality, until they turn on you
Profit from the anger
Fill your pockets with an oppression
That once plagued you
Homilies deceptive
Fanatical lies
Anti pathetical work the work you do
You will not stop until the races are at war
Total supreme division the end you have in store
Hate those not of your kind
They are the tyrants who oppressed you
This cannot be...
You... Insult the intelligence of mankind
You... Are the antagonist
Preaching your hate
You are the real racist
Who killed Malcolm X?
Your life is filled with greed
Disciples of your hate
The seeds of manâs extinction
Impostor to Luther King
Man with the true views
Hide from your words of hate
When we all turn on you
