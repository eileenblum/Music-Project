Abstinence to heal impurities
Deserted child, the prodigal son
A chemical well-being thrust upon you
Inherit yourself, cause you're the only one
Agitate me and i become
A beast that breathes no air
Repress myself
Instinctive reaction
My eyes roll back again
Catastrophes agonize
The system of the animal
An outcast
A freak to what the rest call the norm
So misguided.
The path you choose will only lead to the end
Slowly fading out the picture.
I have lost my grip
The system of the animal
Not here to please anybody else's needs.
I have lost my sense
I am tired of apologizing
I have no remorse for human mistakes
I am tired of trying to be
A perfect mold in their eyes
Content in my vice
Drawn to the lewd
My pain will suffice
The path that i choose
Freeing myself of all these obligations
Closing my eyes
To the world alone
