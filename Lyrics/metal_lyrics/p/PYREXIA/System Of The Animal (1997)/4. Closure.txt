Feed my worth, fill my hunger
Cure my needs, heal my anger
All is lost, and all is broken
For what I chose, my life confusion
Emptiness
A void surrounds me
Causing incapacitations
Feelings of nothingness
Tie me to isolation
Day after day I waste my life
In search of answers to my perversions
Fall from within
My cruel anxiety
Shame unforgiven
My virtual slavery
Unbridled release of this anguish
In a final act of pure obscurity
Desperation overcomes
Ending in a paradox of competion
In my head the voices call me
I smoke my weed, and god, I love it
I know I am right, I know the answers
My fate serves me, my own disaster
