Brought to unworldly madness
Season last forever
Synopsis of pure anguish
Tomorrow will not come
Restrained by amputation
Ruined by the ignorance
No will to find their way

The sins of the father are those unto the son
What is ones twisted mindset
Your deeds canât be undone

Patience has run out
Thereâs no answer to your prayers
Fits of rage begin
Canât control
No pulse no pain
Have to cut myself to feel
Victimize yourself and end it all

Unbridled mass depression
Break a person from inside
Mind manipulation
Constant thoughts of suicide
The need to sterilize the answer to the pain
Eyes conceive the doom that consuming all of you

Cost of sacrifice
Bleeding from my eyes
Lacerated state
Inducing inhuman fate
