Wars have come
And death to follow
History predicts tomorrow
All is lost
And all is broken
What have done
Brings truth and knowledge

Sin the savior
Deny the process
United strong
In death we prosper

With the siege of the suffering
Killing of the masses
Overthrow everything
As our dominance massacres
We will never fall down to your blind sided cowardice

Pray for yourselves
You will be sacrificed
For years your tyranny caused needless misery
And the pain so strong
We aint never gonna forget that shit mother fuckers
Your peopleâs weeping
It was plain to see
Peace by force
No apologies
