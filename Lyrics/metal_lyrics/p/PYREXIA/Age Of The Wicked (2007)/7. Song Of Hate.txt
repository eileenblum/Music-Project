Sentiments of the past cloud my future
Bound and gagged before my eyes
Death is the only escape
I am a product of my pain

Lights out
Time unbearable
Sensory deprivation
Doors lock before my eyes
No remorse only shame
Brought to my knees
What will become of me
Fetal position
Acts of insanity

I am reality
I am the truth
I am the terror that you created
A human disease

My mind is jaded
This is my hell
The screams turn to laughter
My face begins to shatter

No reason for anything
Donât push me
It feels like the apocalypse
My destiny
In these walls
Start going mad
Kill everyone
Final overture
A song of hate I sing to you
