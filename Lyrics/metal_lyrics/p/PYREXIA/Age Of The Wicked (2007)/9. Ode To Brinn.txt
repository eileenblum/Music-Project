Tyrant to the family
Uncontrolled any drunken
House of insecurities
3 long years of beckoning
Living for adultery
Youâre an embarrassment
Brinn
You make me hate you
I donât even know you but you took my life for granted
Brinn
You brought this on yourself
Just like the women laid on your sacred bed
Mother left mourning for eternity
Not a single bit of truth within your life
A line separates the family
Die to bring peace to the purity of pain

Never to scar another soul again

I drift to sleep with a smile
Feeling Iâm the cause of your death
I wished your demise for 9 years
Abandoned as a child ageing 1
Never looking back
Never made attempts to hold your son
Drink away your life
Smoke away your health
Punished not enough
Heart attack 48
Never seem to know when to stop
Beating and crying
A mother lays screaming in despair

Agony

It seems now that youâre gone
Nothing left provided
Stranger dead to me
I met you at your funeral
No pity in my heart
Ill never call you father
You canât replace this hatred
Its tearing me apart

Betrayal

Alone at the eulogy
Spewing lies for the family
Sympathy does not exist
No tears only apathy

Crying out in hysteria
Stomach twisting its hard to breathe
With all this laughing
I cannot conceal
Lament your passing
Cannot be pacified

Pacified

[Lead: Cozens]
[Lead: Marchais]

Forced birth thrust upon you
Your mistake your demise
Vindication
Sacrifice
Now I must suffer with your blood through my veins
