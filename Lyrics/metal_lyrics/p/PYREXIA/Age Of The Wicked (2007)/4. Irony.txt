When I wake up
I see myself trapped inside
With head in hands, I swallow my pride
And everyday, I do the same rites
Reaching out to break through this cage
The disgust, it seeps through my skin
But within, it grips at my mind
As I settle in, and walk the steps of this dance
Driven, by the whip that bleeds

[Lead: Cozens]

Lies are given, time is stolen,
my patience reduced to nothing
These fools, get under my skin
feast like leeches
I'm tempted to open my veins

Thrown away another day
It compliments to nothing

Words can't express all I have to say
This is just a piece of my insanity
Who I am, where I roam
in this cell block crazed home
Detained lashing out I vent my rage
The creature within us cannot be contained

A million bystanders fall into this stage
There is no chance of winning this race
Look into the eyes of the enemy
Reflections in the mirror so clear
Contemplate your own self inside out
Listen to the voices of reason
Shatter the image of the broken one
We fall into denial
