Ages past of a dominant breed
Race of evil
Dormant for a thousand years
Now they rise again to walk the earth
A taste for blood
With hopes to claim us all as slaves
Procreate among the populace
Blending in behind a curtain of flesh
Eyes deceive what is lurking inside
Words themselves they cannot describe
Hordes descend as they reveal themselves
What once looked human now looks hideous
Winged creatures circle from above
Claiming victims helpless as they try to run

[Lead: Basile]

Segregate those that don't belong
Non-believers children of a lesser god
Un-relentless they pillage ahead
Killing those they didn't enslave

Victimize!

Falsify - the system that you hold your beliefs in
Glorify - the martyred ones who pray at the altar
Faith denied - years are wasted, worship unjust
The wicked rise - kneel to those who now claim yours soul
