I see things are not the way they seem
Hidden meanings cloud my brain
Why do your words torture me
Visions of murder come so clear
Demons come to min 3
Why do they follow me?
Why is my life filled with misery?
Everything I feel, makes me hate

As I set all faults aside
Slipping into the abyss of fear
Grind my teeth lashing out in spite
Forced control, make you mine!

As I woke up from a dream
Everything I ever thought of was reality
Skies open up to pour out misery
Tears of anguish
Cleansing me

There comes a time
When all things
Must come to an end
And that time is now

In the dawn of the agony
The final breath
The spoken prophecy
Are we better of lying dead?
Worth nothing, nearing the end

Hope is lost
Only anguish
Sinful thoughts
Blackened image
Infanticide
A child unborn
A motherâs wish
Broken and scorned

A victim of subconscious nature
Subject to obscure behavious

As I woke up from a dream

Cleansing me
