If I fall from grace
Is my life worth anything
All these years I've tried in vain
To erase mistakes I've made
Tie me down
Rip my heart out
Break my will
Scream my lungs out
Why do my needs feel like sins to me?
Am I sick?
Maybe just human

Consuming all my consciousness
Things I once liked now mean nothing
Something's wrong I can't describe

I'm bound by the shackles of my mind

Here I am just me and my thoughts again
Forced to question my point in life again
If I bury these feelings deep inside
Will I sleep at night?
Or will I die?
Pressure

I see my life flash in front of my eyes
Is this the end?
Am I dreaming?
