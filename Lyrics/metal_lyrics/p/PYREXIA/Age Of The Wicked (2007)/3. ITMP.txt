Targeted once again
Over years of deterioration
All faith dropped like a stone
Falling out of consciousness

Pushed too far
Fits of rage
Closing in
I want to murder
My past and feel the guilt no more

Succumb to fear
A life of Paranoia

Victimized feelings of hopelessness
Spilling my guts in revelation
Crisis - Built on Adrenaline
Fall to the Throes of your intentions

There is no entity
No blame to place on anyone
The cost of your reality
Leaves no excuse for your demise

Identity
Wrapped in the arms of apprehension
Theft
What once was yours belongs to them now
Murder
The consequence of your acquittals
Plot
The final act unveiled to you

[Lead: Cozens]

Pushed too far
Fits of rage
Closing in
I want to murder
My past and feel the guilt no more
