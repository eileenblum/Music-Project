I speak in tongues when I sleep
Possessed mind and body
I can't control my urges
They won't stop using me
My pain, chosen vessel
It wants to eat my soul
I scream in desperation
Blood trickles from my eyes

Perpetual sacrifice
Descend upon the living
Purgatories never end
Unnatural stench is hideous
My family prays for my soul
Unspoken holy sacrament
Exorcise this evil
Save my life

Banished souls cast under god
Feeding on the innocent
Praying on the weakness
Ones who passed unto the light
Not of this world
Undead who refuse to die
Too many voices speak inside
Ravage my thoughts
Overwhelmed by the legion
Comatose and paralyzed
Buried alive in this subconscious state

Free us from this pain
They will have their way
Priest I beg you
Drive them from my mind

Shadows talk to me
Make them stop their lives

Seizures overcome
Brain is now hemorrhaging
Unrelenting beast inside itself
Taste of foul
Putrid blasphemy
Limbs contort uncontrollably
Involuntary release of all bodily fluids
Blurry thoughts of suicide - Embraced by the arms of abomination

[Lead: Basille]

Perpetual sacrifice
Descend upon the living
Purgatories never end
Unnatural stench is hideous
My family prays for my soul
Unspoken holy sacrament
Exorcise this evil
Save my life
