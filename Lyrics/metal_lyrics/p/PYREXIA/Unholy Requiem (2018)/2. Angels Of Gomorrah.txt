Fall skies open
Forged from mortality
Born into flame, not of sin
The angels of Gomorrah

Stand before Lot
His commandments
That Sodom must burn
Acts against god, he has noticed
They must be erased

Bring your wife and children
Take heed of this warning
Malice and spite
You've been chosen
But none will remain

Non believers unimpressed
They sleep in denial
Lot is now pleading with the angels
To spare them this dread

The ancient scripture reads
A city left in ruin
The temple cold and dry
They should have known as well

In silent vigil
His family prays in vain
The people they must suffer
There is no other way

With no religion
The flock has gone astray
All hope is lost forever
And now the sinners all must die

Scorned the creator
Raze the villages, leave not anyone
Sickening, the apostate
Kneel to the prophet, breath not one word

Fall upon the sword, don't look away
Turn flesh to salt
Wings are circling
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

Violated kingdom
Saving the unsavior
Orgies consummate
Drunken wickedness
Viral the disconnect

Vile impurities breed apathetic demagogue
The hypocrisy wrapped in lies
Veil of deception
Killing is magnified
Questions rise
Will it happen again?
