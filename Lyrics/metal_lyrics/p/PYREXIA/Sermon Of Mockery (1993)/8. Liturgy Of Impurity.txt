Mary, whore to demons 
Prostitute to the enslaved 
Infertile, mother of God 
Bearing, child unborn 
Fetus, cloaked in darkness 
Bloated, unclean savior 
Jesus, evil birthright 
Bastard, father unknown 

Afterbirth, seeds of Satan 
Baptized, drowned in torment 
Deformed, born of a dog 
Offspring, offering of blood 
Tempted, by your Master 
Denied, doomed to your cross 
Betrayed, sold for pleasure 
Feeble, savior of none 

Bow 
Tortured slave of mockery 
Kneel 
Before me false messiah 
Crawl 
On your knees in fear 
Bow 
To the Prince of Darkness 

You dare deny the truth 
King of the Jews is a myth 
Nailed to your cross of lies 
Thorns of hate upon your brow 
Mocked as you hung in pain 
Plead to the one who is not 
Risk your life at his word 
We now rejoice in your death 

Bow before me 
I am the true God of all Gods 
You will obey 
Your image of truth will enthrall 
Speak through the light 
But you will lead all souls to Hell 

Virgin Mary violated 
Conceived you, a son of Satan 
Crucified for your denial 
Where is he who art in Heaven? 

Disciples deny you thrice 
As the hands are washed of you 
As you take your dying breath 
True ancestry dawns on you 
I await you at your side 
I come for that which is mine 
Martyr of unholy ways 
Resurrected through my will 

Extinction, of apostles 
Genocide, of divine 
Created, in blasphemy 
Destroyed, by your truth

Bow 
Tortured slave of mockery
