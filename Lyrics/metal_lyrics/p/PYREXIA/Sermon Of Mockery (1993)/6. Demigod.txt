Freed from the mouth of the worm
Bewitched by your blood
Drawn by pandemonium
I come for your soul
Corrupt sacred blood of life
Mephisto commands
Exalt his name in my ways
Spawning souls unclean

Horned Gods, arise
Profane names, spake aloud
Maleficent, death orgy
Pious life, crucified

Ancient serpents now awaken
Come, do what we wilt
Gate of darkness torn by chaos
Unleashed blasphemy

Entrails of man
Rivers of blood
Skinned sacrifice
Altars of flesh

Drag you below, torturous sights
Corpses lay strewn in my abyss of filth
Carved by my claws gutted and drawn
I trod the skulls and bones of victims past 

Demigod
Devour souls not of us
Demigod
Sate our craving for your flesh

Demigods of timeless horror
Wakened through your anarchism
Quench our pain of eternal thirst
Feed on the souls of you mortals

Your body now devoid of life
Soul is entwined through my hands
Lifeforce now bows to my will
Come taste immortality
Being now vibrates with power
Devoured souls enlighten
Manifestations of Hell
Corrupted unholy host 

Infernal abominations
Embellish my realm of shadows
Partake pain of my desires
Abandon hope, ye who enter
