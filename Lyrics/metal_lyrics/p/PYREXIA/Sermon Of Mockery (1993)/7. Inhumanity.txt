Falling through a rip in the fabric of time
Dimensional gate cracked to release the unholy
Thrust into this world from ethereal existence
Feeding on the pains of a decadent human race
Worms unleashed...
Chaos calls...
Souls cry out...
Burn useless race...
Pitiful...
Supplicate... die
So he comes existing on tear
All of your dreams are real
World to feast on, world to unmake
Mankind shall all be destroyed
I love the pain, misery and death
I love this world, war and disease
Wasted land, dying breed
Age is at hand, mass genocide
This fate is yours, your souls entwine
Crawl to me, sinful horde
Immortal one now walks to this earthly plane
Forgotten dead all rise to hear his summons
Friends of war
Drowning in sin you embrace insanity
Realize the end come and you are godless
You will die
You...
Anguish in your fear
Suffocate in pain
Watch your fate unfold
Give your soul to me
I have won
