untrue your reality
cocoon of shame
lies
tightly wrapped
smoke and shadow
rebuke those who emulate
high and mighty
false gods
bow before us
shallow mindset demonstrative
dull and rusted
grovel
beneath the heel of disgrace
dawn upon the inevitable
shunned away
meek
your passage denied
shape shifter
face uncovered
hunched over
charlatan
blindness
look away
cowardice
nothing to see
subjugate
mortification
eviscerate
