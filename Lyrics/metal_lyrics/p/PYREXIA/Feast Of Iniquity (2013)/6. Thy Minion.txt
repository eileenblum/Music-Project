it's a mockery
truth untold
pain was the strategy always end in tragedy
objectify
administer
no trace for generations
chromosome manipulation
nefarious
behind the curtain
sinister deviants they control the medium
mind control relinquishes
enter thy dominion your are thy minion

I'm not animal
man cannot survive on bread alone
fall in line with the leaches and the clones
chain is to tight
start to agitate
break the cyclical foretold prophecy
undo what was never meant to be
paradox
two faces
one invisible the other one miserable
hand that guides
fifth column
siege on the agony
bring upon the apathy
one more stab at the jugulator
look at what you've become you are thy minion

separate the fact from the fiction
spill the lies
at you own peril
omulate the contradiction
the crooked path you choose to follow

flat line
one step away from sanity
metastasize
black and putrid grows within
crush kill annihilate

in the dawn of man
there is hatred amongst the wicked
sin is not cruelty
you are all my children now
thy minion
