skull crusher
the punisher
bodies on the ground
personal mortuary
loud crashes
holy thunder
brain starts to leak fluid
from the cranium
pulverized
gears grind
ripping your mind like a
panzer tank lobotomy
overtake
exsanguinate
watching the light as it drains
this is my life
not your life
I will hunt you down like
it's my right
I'm a mad man
with a mad plan
don't get in my way
take a hard stand
we'll roll you and control you
we'll break you down till we own you
you were forced in
then bossed in
now you know what happens
when you crossed in
eyes 
ears bleeding
cracking of the spine
can't see
hematoma
fever grows
pyrexia
burning down the walls
melt you from within
flash point
incinerated
eradicating you and your
ilk from the planet
termination
erase the past
befall unto you
man under god
you cannot stop your untimely peril
you're down in flames your life is over
