Parasites infiltrate
containment is impossible
mass hysteria
but there is no escape
airborne in nature
its spreads across the globe
the population dwindles
nothing left but stone
third world disaster
they were the first to go
at first the livestock
and then to the children
innoculation will not delay the virus
The cause unknown
science has failed humanity
isolation will just delay the horror
the symptoms start to show
the first one is pyrexia

Sentenced
To death by germination
biological
a human petre dish
Organisms
Blood complications
Genetic
Cell Deviation
Microscopic
Kill with intention
Epidemic
cranial mutation
comatose
rapidly deteriorates
once it begins to breed it never stops.

Your nose begins to bleed
you think its just a trickle
now the ears
total exanguination
help me
contagious outbreak
no survivors
what once controlled is now extinct

spinal detection
extraction of the fluid
inject the pain
release eternal sorrow
help me
The spores have left me dead
the germs have won
and now into the oven
Depopulation of man
eradication damned
