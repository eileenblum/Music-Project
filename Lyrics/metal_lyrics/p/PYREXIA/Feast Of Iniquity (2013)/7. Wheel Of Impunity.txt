horns of battle
trumpet sounds of dimune
seething rage
fall to the sword of the hierarchy

time has come to cleanse the infected
hear the howls of the forest through the darkness
lead the horses
release the wolves
whip the slaves
drain them of their will
foresee prophecy liturgy impurity

lower the gates
follow the hounds
the scent of Utu
besieged

raise the flags
call to the color guard
burning arrows
season the onslaught

maniacal
tyrannical
heresy
brought to your knees

drain the wells
poison the livestock
burn the fields
nothing to breathe
