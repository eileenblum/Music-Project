Stand up
apostles of rage
form a circle
unshackled from reason
cold and mute
dust and hollow remains

backed into a corner
my senses turn to instinct
you can't delay the suffering
the chemicals in my brain
begin to pump adrenaline
blood stream mixed with ferocity
limbs start to swing without intent
my eyes roll back again
gasping
diminished lung capacity
out of body
thoughts are frozen solid
melting
beneath the flames of intensity
reactive
the memory fades to grey

evil
has become what is born in me
evil
horrid mist hanging over
evil
only pain brings me solace
evil
the punishing emptiness

I just cant stop myself
why wont it stop
the anguish is draining me
nothing can heal me
my soul is diseased
the urges continue
over and over
