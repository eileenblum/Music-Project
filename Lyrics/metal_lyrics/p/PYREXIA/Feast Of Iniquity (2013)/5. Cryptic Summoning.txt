sores
open
wounds
liquid
spilling red
coagulates
torn
disintegrated
piles of ash
burned at the stake
only the pure
unspoiled by he who has come from the lamb
sour the stench
flames u endure
chosen to burn for the sake of the flock
skin starts to blister
twisted in form
alive as your bone marrow peels from within
dancing and laughing
rabid for more
tortuous ritual
visual rite
arise
specters
triangular
seething
menacing
apparition
demigod
summoning
