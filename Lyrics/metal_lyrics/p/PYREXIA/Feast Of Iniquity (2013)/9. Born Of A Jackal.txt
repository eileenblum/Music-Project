carve from bone
my crown for me
and my cup
fill with blood from their children
clothing sewn from skin
stripped and woven flesh
bred for consumption
species inferior
degregate mere mortals
statues of stone and wood
rooms filled
enter my chambers
locked in lunacy
drippings of blood and wax slices
deep and crossing
my artwork upon your flesh
human canvas
live and breathing
less and less with every stroke
slow and painful
epidermal
I have only just begun
its building
these feelings are raging
this fire is burning
its burning the stench of my pyre
bound by you squalor
unable to face the progression
race doomed to extinction
forced into impotence
now for the banquet
raised chalice in hand we salute
we have come
none to follow I am monarch
my reign supreme
