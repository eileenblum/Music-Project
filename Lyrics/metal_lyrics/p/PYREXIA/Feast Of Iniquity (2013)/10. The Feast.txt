Let the feast begin!

Feast, Unclean
Iniquity
Pure the act of Gluttony

Meat and bone
For pleasure
Boiled in stew
Served openly

Human intestine
Overflows my plate
Fruits and wine
We're laughing

Garnished with appendages
Monarch
Behold my rule of smite
Gorging upon the human race

Minions
Obedient slaves
The table is set
Eternal communion

Thirty Seven courses of anguish
Satisfied
Umbilical floss

Bloated
Perpetual feasting
Regurgitate
Start eating again

Feed me [2x]
