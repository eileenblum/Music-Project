[music: lum, levalois. lyrics: levalois]

We travel without time
For sake of human kind
Bring forth the spice at will
Breath in, breath for the kill
Of house atreides
The war has made this
A broken nation
Defy, amplify
Feel
My mind in motion
See
See my voice
Life destroy
Take water like a drug
Stop when it's not enough
Of house harkonnen
The war has made them
Such a damnation
Defy, amplify
Feel
My mind in motion
Defy, amplify
Feel
My mind in motion
