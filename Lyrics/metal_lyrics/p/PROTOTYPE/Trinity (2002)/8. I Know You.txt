[lyrics and music: levalois]

Another one is programmed
The culprit on the run
Beneath the darkened sun

It saturates the system
Striking at the core
Always wanting more

Recognizing
I know you 
Not because you want me to
Analyzing
I know you

Gave you the chance to exit
My will over your wrong
You crumble into song
The pattern,  it consumes you
Ripping at your soul
Eliminating you

Recognizing
I know you 
Not because you want me to
Analyzing
I know you

Recognizing
I know you 
Not because you asked me to
Analyzing
I know you
