[music by lum/levalois]
[lyrics by levalois]

We invoke the triad strain
Summoning your end
The signal to transcend
Sight of order we regress
Thrills of chaos reign
Sentient loss unveiled

[chorus 1:]

Forget your destiny
Replace deficiency
Retrieve the thought that caused your scorn 
And call it trinity
Passion with such energy
Cleansing poison
Modern vision
Of virtuosity

Remember what you are
Flesh of holy nothingness
A prisoner of your god
Distilled, infectious reckoning
Ravenous minds abound
The future of mankind

[chorus 2:]

Forget your destiny
Replace complacency
Release the fire that burnt your soul
And call it trinity
Power with such energy
Cleansing poison
Modern vision
Of virtuosity

Indifference over argument
Listen without word
Filter out, subvert
Reaping radiant benefit
Redeem your conscious mind
Impart, retain, subscribe

[chorus 1:]
