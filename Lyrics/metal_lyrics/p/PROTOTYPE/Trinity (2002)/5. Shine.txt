[music: lum, levalois. lyrics: levalois]

Lives made of stone
They do what they don't understand
No mind of their own
Only the instincts remain

Feel the sun
Shine on one
Feel the sun
Shine

People awake
Fill your hearts, regain your dreams
Make no mistake
What you believe might not be

Feel the sun
Shine on one
Feel the sun
Shine
