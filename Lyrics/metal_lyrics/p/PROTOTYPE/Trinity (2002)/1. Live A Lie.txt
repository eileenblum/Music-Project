[music by lum/levalois]
[lyrics by levalois]

I hang my head in sorrow
Angered by fate's design
This world with no tomorrow
Why does it live a lie?

Bound by the laws of madness
There which the darkness preys
Each of us claim to greatness
Each of us death embrace

[chorus:]

It fills my life with hope
It watches over me
My own decisions flow

Persistent, we endure
The masses, immature
The future is secure

The promise always broken
Assurances insane
The book is never written
The road is never tamed

You live a lie so faded
Rebuilding facts at dawn
You bet your soul so jaded
We use our will so strong

[chorus:]

It fills my life with hope
It watches over me
My own decisions flow

Persistent, we endure
The masses, immature
The future is secure
