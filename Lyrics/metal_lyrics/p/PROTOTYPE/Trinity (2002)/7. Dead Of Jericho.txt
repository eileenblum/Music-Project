[music: levalois, lum. lyrics: levalois]

Seasons will follow 
The death of the land 
Governed by spirits 
The sons of abraham 

Let the wind blow 
Let it begin 
The end of the new world 
The source of all sin

Rejoice for the ones to come 
We must let them go 
Rejoice for the one to lead 
The dead of jericho

All who condemn us 
Let you be gone 
For what has been written 
Must always be done 

The path to salvation 
The reason for life 
In death we have found it 
For death we must fight

Rejoice for the ones to come 
We must let them go 
Rejoice for the one to lead 
The dead of jericho

And the walls come tumbling down 
And the dead peace have found
