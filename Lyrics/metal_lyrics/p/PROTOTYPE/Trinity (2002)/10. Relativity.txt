[music: lum/levalois]
[lyrics: levalois]

I touched the hand of god today
And felt the pain and emptiness
Images of man
A single truth instead
Clear as day
That no one would dare say

I sought the wrath of death today
It changed my life and burnt my soul
Depleted i remain the same
Sacrificed in vain
Cold as night
Awaiting to be saved

Space inside of me
A side i cannot see
Recognize yourself
No waiting to be held
Reconcile the time
Relative to reasons of pride

Retroactive insanity
Relative relativity
Imminent exposure
To deliverance of what is in me
