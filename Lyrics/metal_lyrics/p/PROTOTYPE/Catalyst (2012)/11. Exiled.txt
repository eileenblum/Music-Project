To be banished from the womb
Cast from that which we assumed
Shimmering lights glow overhead
Abandoned by those who...

Misled us
Betrayed us
Controlled us

They'll never again...

Dare our consensus
Anoint us with jealousy

Exiled, we are here
Set to commune with man
Exiled and devoid of fear
Never to see our lands

A skeptic's mind we face
Alliances new must take place
To our home a warm disgrace
Reflecting on those who...

Misled you
Betrayed you
Controlled you

They'll never again...

Feel so unknown to you
Enslave this humanity

Exiled, we are here
Set to commune with man
Exiled and devoid of fear
Sever corroded strands
Exiled, we are here
Set to commune with man
Exiled and devoid of fear
Never to see our lands

[Solo: Kragen]

Only the righteous will prevail
Violent transcendence to light
Our deprived immortal souls
In turn finding those who...

Misled them
Betrayed them
Controlled them

We'll never again...

Nomadic correction
Sail into eternity

Exiled, we are here
Set to commune with man
Exiled and devoid of fear
Sever corroded strands
Exiled, we are here
Set to commune with man
Exiled and devoid of fear
Never to see our lands
