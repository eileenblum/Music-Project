Witness the birth
Behold the catalyst
Feedback, make ready
Inciting history
Speed through the stars
Reach out the never
Find a new way
Exist

Life unpredicted
Reactions chemical
Evolve the primer
Construct the radical
Our time will come
Control the future
Reject the past

Sail the seas of space
Hoping we will find our resting place
With fate's embrace

We feel the hunger
Fueling the path we lead
This pain insatiable
Infusing every seed
Senses awake
Spare no emotion
Devour life
Corrode

This journey of a thousand years
Has torn us on the way
Remember brilliant hemispheres
Horizons silver gray
Tear out my eyes
Wipe clean this vision
Deprive the will to break

Sail the seas of space
Hoping we will find our resting place
With fate's embrace

[Solo: Kragen]
[Solo: Vince]

We sail the seas of space
We'll rest in fate's embrace
