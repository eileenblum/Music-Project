Welcome to what lies just beyond this great divide
We cross the chasm
Walk the path to where all our thoughts and dreams collide

Just as humanoids in form
Reaching the unobtainable
So susceptible to our own evolution reborn

Will you save us from the cold inside?
And take communion
Can we turn the page and hold this pride?

Feel the filtered light from the sun of gods forlorn
We are the future
No more sutures left to retain the darker days

And now the symbiotic spread
A synchronized existence
No more distant than a needle pulling thread

Will you save us from the cold inside?
And take communion
Can we turn the page and hold this pride?

We are the dreamers and you are the dream
Of broken minds
We take communion, tear the world at the seams

At the seams
Dreams
Of broken dreams

[Solo: Kragen]

Just as humanoids in form
Reaching the unobtainable
So susceptible to our own evolution reborn

Evolution reborn
Evolution reborn
