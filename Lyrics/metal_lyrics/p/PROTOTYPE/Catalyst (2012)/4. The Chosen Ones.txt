Take my remedy
Let me ease the pain
Relieve your suffering
Believe the things you say
Words from your trap, the truth will not portray

Waiting now for skies to clear
Distant and cold
Searching for the grand design
Far and wide
Close and here

What is this I see?
Punish the meek
With their own thoughts enslaved
Wrapped around a simple plan
I'll have you eating from this empty grave

Analyze the universe
Distant and cold
Scrutinize this dismal world
Far and wide
Close and here

Here we are the chosen ones
All we take is your disgrace
Your disgrace

[Solo: Kragen]

[Solo: Vince]

Waiting now for skies to clear
Distant and cold
Searching for the grand design
Far and wide
Close and here

Here we are the chosen ones
All we take is your disgrace
Here the unfamiliar stray
To feed on all soulless prey
Prey
