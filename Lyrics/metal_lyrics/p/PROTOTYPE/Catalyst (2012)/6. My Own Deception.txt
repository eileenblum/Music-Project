It came to me just like a nightmare
First I felt the hate
Then touched the sky
Feelings of distress just whisked away

Shroud of perfect, easing darkness
Did it ever leave?
I canât recall
The last I tried
My eyes bled tears of joy

My own deception
The pain is no longer my own
Is this me? It all seems so surreal
Mind infiltration
Resisting a dark god of rapture
Now I kneel to my master

I will persist, let go your mind
Do not resist, we are entwined

Leave me
Youâve crossed the empirical line
Return to your kind

This foreign star, not like our sun
Weâve come too far, it must be done

Nothing I do can keep you at bay
My senses astray

I walk the Earth, forever unaware
Now rejoice unto my spirit veil
The deathless youth
Eternal wisdom sail

A never-ending source of power
You will walk the path or turn a slave
The more you stand
The more I dig your grave

My own deception
The pain is no longer my own
Is this me? It all seems so surreal
Self-reconstruction
Look into the eyes of despair
Then fall in their wake

I will persist, let go your mind
Do not resist, we are entwined

Leave me
Youâve crossed the empirical line
Return to your kind

This foreign star, not like our sun
Weâve come too far, it must be done

Nothing I do can keep you at bay
My senses astray

[Solo: Kragen]
[Solo: Vince]
[Solo: Kragen]

A plan to imprison us all
Until we find a way
In time their perversion will stall
For now, surveil

[Solo: Kirk]

It came to me just like a nightmare
I walk the Earth, forever unaware

The pain no longer there
I've lost the will, my sense of reason
The core in disrepair
Can I believe my own deception?
