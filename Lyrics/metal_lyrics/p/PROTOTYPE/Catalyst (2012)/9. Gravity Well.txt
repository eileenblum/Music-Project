There's nothing more to say
When death surrounds us all
Our bodies feel the scourge
It rips the flesh forever more

I see the growing well
A stare casts out its spell
Relive the sounds of war
Reform the bloodline

We won't be taken
These eyes are not meant for you
You were not chosen
Our skies were not spent for you

Don't think you can take us down
These cries for mercy drown your insolence
Humanity's regrets
Could justify this death of innocence

I've seen the growing well
Its stare casts out a spell
Relay the word ahead
Release the undead

We won't be taken
These eyes are not meant for you
You were not chosen
Our skies were not spent for you

[Solo: Kragen]

This road which leads to peace
Will carry us to a final tale
Lock down the door, retreat
Rebuild our world with a new unveil

I see the closing well
A glare no longer there
The hope may now return
Persistent candles burn

We won't be broken
Our eyes are not meant for you
With minds in motion
The sky will again be true

[Solo: Kragen]
[Solo: Vince]
