Time can only pass you by
Burying you alive
Passions found wither away in kind

Suffocate this bare alliance
Radical points of view
Changing with the winds of arrogance

Don't mesmerize me
Never deceive me

Bearing the weight of the past
What is it for?
A revolving contradiction

Impose the truth on me
Carry this frame of mind
Better to find
The ageless heart of memory
Into infinity

[Solo: Kragen]

Twisting, turning torment
Preaching a perfect world
Emissaries of perplexion

Patronize the impulsive soul
Zealous, vagrant scorn
Painting bliss with pure intolerance

Don't mesmerize me
Never deceive me

Free to be but not to believe
And it's you I blame
The destroyer of redemption

Impose the truth on me
Carry this frame of mind
Better to find
The ageless heart of memory
Into infinity

[Solo: Kragen]

Scorch
Force
Drain

It's cauterizing

Mourn
Hate
Feed

Emotions flying high

[Solo: Kirk]
[Solo: Vince]

The restful sleep
Encroaching on the skyline
