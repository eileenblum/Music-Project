Born, we are raised in fear
Now kneel to our reign

Never will we capitulate
We'll die by fire

The battle, saturated fields
Success is imminent

Your weakness, how it makes you bleed
We'll drive you under

Crossing into retribution
Never give in, recalling sin
Into oblivion
New paths unfold

Blood skies, make their bodies flow
No kindness with pain

All senses are active
Impose our glory

Engage the large array
Circulate the misery

Force feed our constant will
To change the story

Sending a message of reason
Never give in, recalling sin
Into oblivion
New paths unfold

[Solo: Kragen]

The ghosts of past reliance
Defiance of old designs
Throw them away

A new course of action
The ancient, corroded sphere

Elastic waves of tears
Demonic visions

Enough of this persistency
Eternal death shall placate

Spend eternity to think and feel
Our own emotions

Breaking the walls of confusion
Never give in, recalling sin
Into oblivion
New paths unfold
New paths unfold
