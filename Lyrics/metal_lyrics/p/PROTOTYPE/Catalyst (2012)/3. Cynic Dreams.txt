If you feel your emotions entwined
So alone and betrayed
Rise tall and demand stars aligned
Past leaden skies

This war is frayed
Our futile resolve
All these prophets predicted this meager take

Bend your soul
Believe not what leads you astray
Then behold
The power that strengthens
Our last widespread decay

Never soon to be simply let by
Let's assume this mockery
My will is as still as your lies
Of infamy

I won't regret
The choices I made
It will serve as another reminder

Bend your soul
Believe not what leads you astray
Then behold
The power that crushes
Your final, silent, cynic dreams

[Solo: Kragen]
[Solo: Vince]

Tearing the fabric of time
Insomnic thread
Reaching the edge of the line
Now another day

[Solo: Vince]
[Solo: Kragen]

Now awaken, our conscience is one
We begin this strategy
In the end it will render you numb
Not what it seems

Drenched in new life
The quiet remains
Population control, we assimilate

Bend your soul
Believe not what leads you astray
Then behold
The power that crushes
Your final, silent, cynic dreams

[Solo: Vince]
