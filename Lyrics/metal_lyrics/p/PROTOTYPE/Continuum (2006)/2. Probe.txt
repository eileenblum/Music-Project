Take me to your silence
To where the end begins
(The beginning ends)
Circle through my mind
And spread my psyche thin

Let's tear through space and time
Peer at the null and void
(Infinite mass)
Etch the skin with piercing cries
Until the heart explodes

Probing you, damaged you
Probing you (Probe)

Immortal wicked flesh
A taste to never die
(To die forever)
Evasive mortal coil
The spiral that unwinds

Probing you, filtered you
Probing you (Probe)

The end is near, the path is clear
One tainted soul
We drain the sweat, sidestep the fear
Beyond the mold

Probing you, damaged you
Probing you (Probe)
