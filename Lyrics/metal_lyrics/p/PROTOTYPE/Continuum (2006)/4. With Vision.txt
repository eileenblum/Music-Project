Remember the times past
A will of fire, a new book cast
To feel mystified, in turn, tried
The slate concretized, in all its might

Remember...

With vision
See your fate, emancipate
With vision
Watch the flow of seeds you sew

Exchanging vast ideas
Repeating poems as wonder nears
To feel realized, your goals right
The truth formalized, a rare sight

Remember...

With vision
Tides will turn when fires burn
With vision
If you know that it is so

Impending broad event
Can justify this time well spent
The chill in my bones, my sense shine
What was made of stone
Is now a rhyme...
