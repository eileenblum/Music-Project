What will I say in misery?
Whom will I ask to be my advocate?
In times of need I scream to say my name
I feel the knot inside of me set me free

Kneeling in pain
Condemned to the flames
No, I did nothing wrong
I'll never be ashamed
O just lord of vengeance
Be true to thy name
End this prophecy
Please now let me be

Into the night, out of the sky
Eternal lights shine upon my eyes
The reign of angels' sum of lies idolize
Turn the page and find out why we're scared to die

Kneeling in pain
Condemned to the flames
No, I did nothing wrong
I'll never be ashamed
O just lord of vengeance
Be true to thy name
End this prophecy
Please now let me be

Dead is the hill that I must climb
Cold is this God, not alive
Not alive

Kneeling in pain
Condemned to the flame
No, I did nothing wrong
I'll never be ashamed
O just lord of vengeance
Be true to thy name
End this prophecy
Please now let me be
