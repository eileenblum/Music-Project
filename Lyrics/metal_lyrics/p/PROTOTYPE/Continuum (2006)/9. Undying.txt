A somber portrait fills my heart
The feeling of remembering
It makes it so easy to forget
Until I pass you by

The thought of watching not seeing me
And erasing all that was
Portraits fading, the memories end
Replacing this time

I'm undying to forget you
This time
It's undying that I'll turn to

And now the fog begins to rise
I'll return to a cold, cold place
The pain concealed, now tossed away
Just like before

I'm undying to forget you
This time
It's undying that you'll burn to
