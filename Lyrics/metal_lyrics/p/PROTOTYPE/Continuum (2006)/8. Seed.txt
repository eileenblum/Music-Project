Learning to fly in skies
That fail to persuade my soul
Has shattered my mind
So helpless I bleed
Emptied nest of creativity
The silence no longer my friend
Or my seed

Found myself holding on
To something that was so untrue
Trying to make up for all
That was gone
Reversing time and fighting the tide
Impregnating fate with my pride
I will not compromise
