Flesh ripped to shreds
Thrown down a grate
Spinning blades
Chop and gyrate

Deep in the skin
Hung by a hook
Blood pools below
Others alive
All looking shook

Packed in ice
Death in a freezer
All was for naught
No one would believe her

Unnatural end
Sins against nature
We had a choice
But no one would save her

All forms of hatred end in abuse
Turn your head away, your views are obtuse
Spiraling down, believing your lies
We sink further every time an animal dies

Each year, more than 100 million animals are tested on in U.S. laboratories.
Over 56 billion farmed animals are killed every year by humans.
Their blood is on your hands.
Their blood is on your hands!
