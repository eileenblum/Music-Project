Left for dead
Miles from home
Sanctions imposed
Won't let you roam

Hurt and afraid
You run fast away
Guilty of treason
You couldn't have stayed

Born into
A world
If you disobey
Your life is extinguished

For once in your life
You didn't listen
Now you are finished

Hunted on the land
You sneak by the sea
Angry dogs follow
You hide in a tree

Faced with the truth
Or what lies they say
You can't stay quiet
Humbling facts are displayed

Running for freedom
They are getting nearer
You were the enemy

Nipped at your heels
Shot in the back
They maintain their supremacy
