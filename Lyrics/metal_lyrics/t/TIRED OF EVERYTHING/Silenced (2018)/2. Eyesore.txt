Deep seated hatred of people
With nothing on their back
Take food out of their babies' mouth
And plan your attack
Clean up the streets and lay waste
To their means of living
Ship them out when their ship has sailed
And laugh at their misgiving

Move em out
Clean up the streets
Thank god
That eyesore is gone

Finally safe
Nothing to fear
We can now
Feel safe in our homes

Relocate the impoverished
To the outskirts of town
Never address the problem
Celebrate a future
Without those cast out
