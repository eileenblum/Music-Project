Look at me
No matter where I've been
Look at me
No matter, I have bleed
Listen to me now
Because your eyes don't want see
Do you see...
Me

Stay with me
And taste a bit of pain
Stay with me
While blood runs through my veins
Drown with me a while
Cause you cannot take me out
Can't you see the dry tears on my lips

Can't let you go
Cause you're all that I have
I am the one who's behind
Don't leave me now
Cause I won't let you go
But now I am deep down on the ground

Stay with me while I am naked
Stay with me (as) I lay alone
Could you wash away my tears
Won't you hold me now
