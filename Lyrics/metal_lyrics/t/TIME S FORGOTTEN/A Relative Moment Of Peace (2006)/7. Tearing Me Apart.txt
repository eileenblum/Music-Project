Why do you keep your face from me?
Why do you laugh at my back?
Why don't you understand
That you're tearing me apart?

What for God's sake do you want from me?
Why do you do this to me?
Why don't you understand
That you're tearing me apart?

Have you lost your sight?
Are you weak outside?
Or just a rotten heart?
Are you blind to the truth?
Are you cold inside?
Let me have my guess...

You do like to bring me down, don't you?
You do like to see me cry, don't you?
You would like to breath me out, can you?
You would like to bring me down

I just want to know why do you do this to me
Can't you see you're tearing me apart?
Have all this years come and gone in vain?
Can't you see that I just love you?
