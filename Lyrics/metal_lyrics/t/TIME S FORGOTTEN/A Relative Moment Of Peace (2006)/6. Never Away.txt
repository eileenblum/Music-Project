Here, my dear
Hear me whispering in your ear
Hear me think of you
Again, and again

Hear my burning heart
Burn in your desire
Feel my deep embrace
As you lay awake

Rest in me, my life
Come, rest in here your heart
Let me wash your worries
Again, and again, and again

Let me be here warm
Let me be your guard
No fear, no cold inside
Come to me my life

Let me see your smile
Let me wonder in your eyes
Cause there I Know no fear
No thorn stings in my heart
Here, don't be afraid
Of falling deep asleep
Cause I'll be here for you
And I'll never go away!
