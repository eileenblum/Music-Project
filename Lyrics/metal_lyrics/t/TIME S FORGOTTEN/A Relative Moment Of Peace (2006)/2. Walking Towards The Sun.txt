Woke up and find myself
Through landscapes of grey,
Through fields of color change
Through skies that ever turns

Light reveals a purple sun,
A shining wall a velvet lawn
Changing fast to ashes and forming again
Filling me with flashbacks and staying the same

Leaving my ideas on the ground
Walking towards the sun
I find myself alone
Learning how to fly
I ran through the sky
Through a different land
In my final stand

Knowing, feeling
Touching this everywhere
Lying leaving, sitting under trees unscarred

Woke up and find myself
Through landscapes of grey,
Through fields of color change
Through skies that ever turns

Light reveals a purple sun,
A shining wall a velvet lawn
Changing fast to ashes and forming again
Filling me with flashbacks and staying the same
