Silent I see, the purple
Sun, the shining wall
The velvet lawn...
I regret for the years past
And stare into the sun

Since I was young I felt
This urge of moving
This need to cling on life
To explore the Sun
In my own calm rhythm

Blinded
Trough all these years of nothingness
Faded
Into the spectrum of light
Bound
With my own hopes and dreams
Betrayed
By the ones I love the most

But it's so common to be stopped
And keep looking down
And tell yourself it was nothing
But a reflection in the pool
That can be taken away with
A movement of the hand
