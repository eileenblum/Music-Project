[Part 2. Real]

Sometimes I ask myself if you're real
Not just substance, either flesh
Not even human but my other me
It's because of the way you
Touch me and bless me with your smile

Sometimes I don't know if we are real
Dancing with our eyes over this piece of ground
Holding our breaths while
We kiss, while we touch,
While we live
As it never will end
As it never will die
As it never will die!..

But you are real,
Sometimes more real than me
Easier to understand than
This troubled heart of mine

Would you be there for me?
Would you be there to understand?
Would you hold me when I
Fall and still love me?
And still love me?

Sometimes I don't know if I am real
Dancing with your eyes
Over this piece of ground
Holding your breath while
We kiss, while we touch,
While we live
Would you tell me?
Would you tell me?
Would you tell me?...

[Part 3. Need]

Oh Father, I know you're here within me
But sometimes it's hard to be quiet,
Sometimes it's hard to listen

When the world all turns gray
Not black, not white,
Not a simple "yes" or "no"
Just an empty "maybe"

Oh Father please take me
Oh Father hold me again
Would you please
Would you please
Heal this heart of mine?

This troubled heart of mine!
