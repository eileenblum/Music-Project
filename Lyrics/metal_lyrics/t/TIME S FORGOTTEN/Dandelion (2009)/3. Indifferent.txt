Tell yourself it's OK
Just wait for things to come
Numb yourself with it
Until you don't feel anymore

Pain is oblivion you say
Ignoring is the key
Call my number now,
I will sell it to you

And if you behave
I'll pat you on the shoulder
And stab you in the back
Shame you didn't have insurance

And if you start waking up
Just watch my wickedly beautiful smile
I'll be waiting right next to you
