Running over green grass
I'm almost there!
Letting the breeze hit my face
And the roaring of the sea at my right

Seagulls spread their wings
I can feel it's near!
I see a ship in the horizon
Its mighty sails on the wind

What news from the north?
What have the depths told you?
What were its plain words to me?
Was it always like this?

Now it's sand I'm running over
A sense of infinity
I can feel it right in front of me!
I can hear its call!
Crashing down I feel it
All around me, deep inside
Like myself, like yourself
As I'm being pulled by the sea

It is my name I'm hearing
From here and everywhere
From light and darkness
From earth to wind to sea
