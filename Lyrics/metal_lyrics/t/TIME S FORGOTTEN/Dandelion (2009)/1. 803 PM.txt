It's alright for the rain to fall
Over my eyes tonight
It's alright for me to walk
These streets alone

Deeper winds I feel you
Whispering to my soul
Mighty streams come talk to me
On this empty streets tonight

It's alright for me not to search
All the rooftops tonight
It's alright not to wait for you
On the pale moonlight

Lightning strikes an alley
And I lay down without you
And it's alright to sleep
Until dawn awakes me
