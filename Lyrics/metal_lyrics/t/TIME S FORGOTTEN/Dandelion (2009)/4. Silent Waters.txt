Remember the mornings
Remember dawn
Remember when we sailed away
To see the birth of a thousand years
Remember smiles
Remember forests
Remember seas
Remember when we sailed away
Into the heart of the sun
Remember peace
Remember love
Remember family
Remember trust
Remember spirit
Remember magic
Remember
Remember us
...and smile
...and smile
