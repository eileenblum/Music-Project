Holding back the smoke
Swallowing you for the second time tonight
Lingering on your ghost
I sit alone for a while, again

Through the window I see the rain fall
And a shadow across the street
Where you were supposed to be for me

I come back to my coffee
Swallowing rage for the second time tonight
Bathing on this sickening light
I wait for a third one

And what if I just leave?
And walk through that door?
And let the rain fall on me?
Just this one time
