Soon the light will go out
And the world transforms into another
I can hear the silence
The deep calm before the darkness
Shades turn to nothing
Shadows come to life
The sun goes down behind you
As I welcome you my night

Deeper winds I feel you,
Mighty streams come talk to me
Tell me of your journeys
Tell me of your secrets
Tales of seasons past

Let me look inside, my night
Let me find myself in you
Fill me with your peace
Until dawn awakes me
Until dawn awakes me

Deeper winds I feel you,
Mighty streams come talk to me
Let me look inside, my night
Let me find myself in you

Tell me of your journeys
Tell me of your secrets
Tales of seasons past
Fill me with your peace

Until dawn awakes me
Until dawn awakes me
