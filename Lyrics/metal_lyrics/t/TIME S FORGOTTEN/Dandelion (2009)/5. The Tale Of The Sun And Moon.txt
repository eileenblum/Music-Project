We call to the earth to live again
We dance under the sky

We take in the land
To feel again
So much like you...
Dandelion

I remember you young, pale moon
We used to talk under that tree
Remember so many nights?
You told me my sun was so bright
But I liked your moonlight better

Do you remember me?, pale moon
I'm the one who talked the nights away
And shone for you every morning
I told you the rain was light
But you liked it on you anyway

Call my name now
Run through the rain and come
Laugh again and again
Run, free spirit and rise
Drink the water now
Scream of joy and come
Smile again and again
My gentle true spirit, smile
