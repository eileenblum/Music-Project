Where have all the winds gone?
Where did their whispers go?
It's as if my breath had gone into the mountains
To share its life with your spirit

Where's your voice when I need it?
That sweet sound of your soul?
It's like it has gone forever
Like the wind
Like rain on a river

We face up to the sky
With brilliant eyes and thoughts
Like reaching out for that glimpse of peace
We pierce through the pain like arrows flying high
But we take some of it with us anyway

But here we are... still
And the wind may have gone
And your whispers are quieter
And your rain lighter
But your spirit lingers, your sweet spirit
Like the mountains and the meadow
