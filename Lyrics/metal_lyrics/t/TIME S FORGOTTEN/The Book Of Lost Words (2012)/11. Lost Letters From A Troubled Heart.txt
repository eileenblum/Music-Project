It's probably just me
With my head out the window
And my sitting in this old chair
Writing my life away.
It's probably just the slight wind
Through the houses down the street
Or the smell of old books
And dust

And it's probably just me
Again and again writing you
Not knowing where you are
Or where you've been
Yeah, it's only just me
And my books, and my window
Wishing you'd walked
With the wind
To me....

But I swear I heard a song,
A whisper of old days and laughs
And all the words we said
And threw away
It's probably all the words I've written
And all the tears I've cried
And all the hopes I've lost
Missing you.
