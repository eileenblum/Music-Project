Got off the road
Heavy breathing
Struggling with a thought,
Eyes wide open
Starting to walk
A trail of mud behind me

Blood runs fast, observation
Sinking fast, no tomorrow

Screaming until someone sees me
Hanging on a wire
Wait for the fall
I need to tell them all I see now
Or should I let them smash against the wall

Rain on my eyelids
Soaked to the bone
Passing flashlights on my face
A million miles away
I cover my face
The darkest night surrounds me

Overdose, saturation
Brain explodes, no control

Screaming until someone sees me
Hanging on a wire
Wait for the fall
I need to tell them all I see now
Or should I let them smash against the wall
