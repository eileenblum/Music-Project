Hoping there's a war to be what you read
And become what you are in your mind
Grasping every bit of breath
And writing every word,
Wishing that it still counts.

But in the end we alswars choos what we do
And you sit down and wonder
If the future and the past
Tend to crash in every word
In this ethereal ground we call mind

And when you hand it down
And let it sink for a while
What stays with you,
What really stays with you
Is that deep feeling of release
And so we let go...
And all my ramblings on these pages
Are gone...
Are gone and burned
By the memory of nothing.

The sweet release
Of not having to care
No anymore... for you.

And when you hand it down
And let it sink for a while
What stays with you,
What really stays with you
Is that deep feeling of release
And so we let go...
And all my ramblings on these pages
Are gone...
Are gone and burned
By the memory of nothing.
