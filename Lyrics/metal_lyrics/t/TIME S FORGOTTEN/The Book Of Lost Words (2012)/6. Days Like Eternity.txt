We used to clinb that tree,
Our tree,
And stood upon the world,
Our world,
And the land showed at our feet
And was yellow green with hope

Stay with me a shile,
And dance with me,
Like we used to in our land
Under that tree

And you took me by the hand
And ran with me
And we fell under the tree,
Our tree
And the sky showed bright
And pale
And we were filled with hope

Hold me by the hand
And smile at me,
Like there is nothing else
But you and me
