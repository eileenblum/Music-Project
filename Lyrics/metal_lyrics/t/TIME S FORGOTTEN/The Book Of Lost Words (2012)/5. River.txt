[with Michael Manring bass intro]Last day of November,
The rain stops,
Goes around the rocks
Never to return

The ground seems to answer
And old calling of taking in
And giving back
Of growing and dying
Like Stones on a river
We are shaped but not moved

She was swalloed
By daylight and mist
By tears and soft earth
Until we forgot about her

The ground seems to answer
And old calling of taking in
And giving back
Of growing and dying
Like Stones on a river
We are shaped but not moved
