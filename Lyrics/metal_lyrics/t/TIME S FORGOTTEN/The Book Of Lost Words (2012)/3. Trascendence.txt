What else do I have
But this old song?
And these few words
Written a long time ago?
When life was slow
And made so much sense
When laugh was easy
But came with tears

What esle can I gice you
But this old heart
And these old hands
Buried deep in the earth?
With my head in the clouds
And my feet on the ground
With my tired smile,
With my swollen feet.

Our time is all we have,
All we can give ot take
And only time will tell
If I will live forever in you.

Please take them to your heart, keep them warm
So they can fill my place when I am gone,
And make you smile
