New sceern,
One more time I'm stuck in the middle
Of a useless set of small distraction
Paralized by the noise in the next room
Trying to focus on something
But I don't know what it is anymore
Instead I open a new screen, again,
And load up something else
To see if someone cares
Because the noise in the next rom is too loud

Maybe if I search harder
Or dehumanize my mind
For a little longer
I could feel something real
Or say something real
With my own voice

Lonely again with so much to say
And so little patience
Fleeting emotios, sensations
I'm not getting any deeper
Than my own skin

But the rain is still louder than the sun
And life feels so small
When you are awake so much
Trying to focus on something
That you don't know what it is anymore
