Millions of thoughts away
Fading into green and black
Lingering, crashing down into existense
Holding pen and paper, and dust and bones

Grabing eternity on my lips
And reality on my hands
I stumble into myself, to let go
To feel the stars align, the planets crumble

Images turn to sweat
Taking me to red and gray,
Keeping myself together for a moment
Leaving only rust and tears, and lies and sand

Grabing eternity on my lips
And reality on my hands
I stumble into myself, to let go
To feel the stars align, the planets crumble
