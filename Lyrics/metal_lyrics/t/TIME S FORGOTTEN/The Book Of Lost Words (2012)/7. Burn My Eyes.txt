There's so much rage and hunger
And it's not ok
To turn your back on me again.
With you in this big machine
Of wheels turning,
Hours running away
But still we go blind
And we trust

But once, for an instant
I barely touched your skin
And we looked at each other
Like there was nothing there
And we just tool for granted
What we could not see
We hold to our routine
And say no....
Said no...

Burn my eyes with you everyday
And it's not too late
To show me back your face again
We play in this big machine

And we cry
And we break
And we die
And we take
And we burn
And we fake
And we try

Of wheels turning,
Hours running away
But still we go blind
And we trust

But once, for an instant
I barely touched your skin
And we looked at each other
Like there was nothing there
And we just tool for granted
What we could not see
We hold to our routine
And say no....
Said no...
