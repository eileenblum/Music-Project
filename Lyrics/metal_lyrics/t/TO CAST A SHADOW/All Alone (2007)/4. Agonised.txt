All these people hanging on every word
carved in stone
never questioning their acts
based on faith
and not on facts
agonised
as i abide humankind
and what seems to be
an endless source
of idiocy
impossible to keep away
from all the staged reality
constantly infesting screens
treating minds as of pre-teens
