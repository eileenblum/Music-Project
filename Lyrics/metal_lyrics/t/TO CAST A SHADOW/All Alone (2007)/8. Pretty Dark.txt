i want to see
everything
restlessness won't leave me be
the future is in front of me
like a brick wall
off it hangs a rope,
now, should I use it to get hung
or to climb?
stranger how a lifetime with no progress
can go by so fast
stagnant, i hope to flourish
like a dead branch.
