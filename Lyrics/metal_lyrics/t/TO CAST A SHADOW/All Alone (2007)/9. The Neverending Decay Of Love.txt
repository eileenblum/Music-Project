this is the end.
make no sense at all.
as we descend i fall deeper
inside your soul,
seeing the endless decay of it all.
could we ever go through
this pain again?
couldn't there be ways to forgive?
shouldn't there be ways to forget?
the look on your face is bleak,
closing the door
to all that i seek. and never will you see
me again, my love..
