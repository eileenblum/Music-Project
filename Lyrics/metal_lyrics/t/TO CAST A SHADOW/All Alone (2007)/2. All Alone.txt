open your eyes and you'll see you're the
only one in my hearth.
everyone else seem to feel certainty
all of this time it has been everlasting
words of despair.
will all the wounds never heal?
who are we?
all of the time we shared,
i was there for you.
all alone we wander.
be all to me..
we share our destiny alone.
