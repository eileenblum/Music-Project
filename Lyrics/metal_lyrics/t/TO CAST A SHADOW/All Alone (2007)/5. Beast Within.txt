see the winter disguise
all i need to realise..
moonshine over the alps, feels like i'm
lost inside lupine dreams.
as a beast i walk alone at night.
my wolf like behaviour
i cannot hidee. lupine king.
no one here could understand the visions
of the man they had feared for so long
now he's all alone. trapped inside this
nightmare i'm holding on to what is the
beast within...
see the beast in his eyes, as i die i realise...
as a beast i walk, alone
