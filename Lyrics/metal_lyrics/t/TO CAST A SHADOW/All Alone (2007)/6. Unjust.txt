all this time
you thought they would hear you
clinging to a hope they would care too
in the end
we will all come to realise
what we hold
as something made
to safeguard us
fails all those
who truly earned the right to benefit
it angers you and me,
but we hold it inside
always
feeling like
all your labour
is in vain
your doing no favours
in the end
we will all come to realise
it's unjust.. don't you feel?
