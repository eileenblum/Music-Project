like a moth to a flame
i burn every time i succumb to your love
and like a train baring down on me
your love has me tied down to the tracks
you will be
the death of me
but i can't leave you be
and as i slowly die
i can't help but enjoy the ride
like a calm to a sail
you render me lost in a sea
of emotion so deep
and like a cry in the night
you lure me into the unknown
with no way to get home
