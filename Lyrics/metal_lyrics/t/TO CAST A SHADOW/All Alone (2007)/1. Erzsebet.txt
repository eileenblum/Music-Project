trapped behind these walls,
loneliness surrounds me. haunted by the
voices of my past.
calling out your name as i'm waiting
for the one to take me away from this.
please let it be my destiny
as i'm left to die, a shadow's cast upon me
calling for the end of my life.
darkness unfolding before me, never had
i thought it could be my destiny
when destinys sorrow enters the dewing
domains of the morrow,
let be rekindled my heart that was frozen,
aimed at by light from
the heavens been chosen.
