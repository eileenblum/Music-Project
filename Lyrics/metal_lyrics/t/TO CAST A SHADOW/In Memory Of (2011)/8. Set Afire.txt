Brought to the edge of existence, I wallow somewhere in between life and death. Lifeless, broken, withered I keep alive. Desiccated, drained I lie here when you...
Set me all afire.
Will to live lost, weakened I try to find a ray of hope to shine on my mind. Faith in you to guide me out of the dark. Only to see that with your spark, you...
Set me all afire.
