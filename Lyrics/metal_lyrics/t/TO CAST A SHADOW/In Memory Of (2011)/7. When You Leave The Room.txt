When you leave the room silence fills the empty space
When you leave the room light disappears without a trace
When you leave the room a breeze comes through the window pane
When you leave the room it 's enough to make me go insane

I am nothing but a pawn in this tragic play.

A shadows shoulder fading away, one tear shed
Things will never be the same now that you have fled.
