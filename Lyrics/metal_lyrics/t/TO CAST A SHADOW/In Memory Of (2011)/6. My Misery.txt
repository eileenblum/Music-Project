Nothing is left, i lost it all
Never again will you hold my hand
What have I done? What have I become?

How could I betray my only love
Words can not explain my misery
What have I done? What have I become?

There is no more
I've lost it all
No will to live, I give in
Could it be this is the end of you and me?
Now I am left here with this pain and misery.
