Strolling at night by the old stream, along the banks where no one can hear him scream. Unaware of the malice burning within his morose, impatient heir...
No one will ever know what happened that night. No one can prove his fall stemmed from a fight.
Seemingly unmoved his legal heir lives on. Hopefully soon he will see retribution.
