I am not all that I can be
Time has forsaken me
Time has forsaken me

Life seems so constant as it slowly us by
In one brief second it could all be thrown to waste
Can you see it slowly fade away?

Is this all you wanted?
All your dreams have disappered
My fate lies open, it will not be torn away
Could it be the answer in my life?

Our time is approaching
we seem to lose control
So many things we should have done before we die

I am not all that I can be
Time has forsaken me
