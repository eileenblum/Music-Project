Torn by my old sins.

Behind these windows I hide myself from the agony of life
All I see around me is death and misery
All around me. All around me

Underneath the surface I long for the day I'll die
Tormented I repent old sins as I give in

Behind closed eyes I render
my sould broke away and surrender
I see clear all I fear. A life in despair
In despair
