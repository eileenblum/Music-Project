Flow my tears, fall from your springs,
Exiled for ever, let me mourn
Where night's black bird her sad infamy sings,
There let me live forlorn

Down vain lights, shine you no more,
No nights are dark enough for those
That in despair their lost fortunes deplore;
Light doth but shame disclose

Never may my woes be relieved
Since pity is fled
And tears and sighs and groans my weary days
Of all joys have deprived

From the highest spire of contentment
My fortune is thrown
And fear and grief and pain for my deserts
Are my hopes, since hope is gone

Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Learn to condemn light;
Happy, happy they that in hell
Feel not the world's despite.
