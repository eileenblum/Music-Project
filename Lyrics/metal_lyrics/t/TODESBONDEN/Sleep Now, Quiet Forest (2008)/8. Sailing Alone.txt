In the cool morning
The flowers greet the sea
With virgin faces
Smiling as we walked by

This chance was gone
Even before it began
And this is how it ends

Sailing gusty wild and lonely seas
Riding for my destiny
I'll let fate label me
With all the she brings to me daringly

With empty kisses
I slowly faded away
Empty hours wasted
With every tear came
But no more now
Now that you are gone
I'm finally free
From fear

All things must pass
But no I will not cry
Because I still have me
