My desperation stalls me
Each move a fighting chance to see
Through veils of burning water
Dark seas envelope me

Breaking waves upon the sodden sand
Holding me down as I reach
Grasping for a quickly fading land
Enshrouding me

Push through a liquid sand dune
Soft stones to bury me in sleep
Echoes a distant savior
Of shells and living things

Breaking waves upon the sodden sand
Holding me down as I reach
Grasping for a quickly fading land
Enshrouding me

Painting the sky with silver
Colors have faded slow in grey
Touch down in distant waters and you are touch me

Bring the slow breath I bear
To one last man to see me through
This is a broken wave to carry you

Breaking waves upon the sodden sand
Holding me down as I reach
Grasping for a quickly fading land
Enshrouding me....

Ah....
