Here I can breathe
Safe from the scorn
I them crying
But from afar

Write me a secret letter
Hidden in a rose
I will be here on soiled knees
A prisoner of the world I sewed

An escape from all I know
Holding on to one last dream
When I wake I realize
I am alone

Write me a secret letter
Hidden in a rose
I will be here on soiled knees
A prisoner of the world I sewed

And in the night you may hear my desperate cry
From distant halls now dark
Calling from beynd the walls of Trianon
Where as my life gone
