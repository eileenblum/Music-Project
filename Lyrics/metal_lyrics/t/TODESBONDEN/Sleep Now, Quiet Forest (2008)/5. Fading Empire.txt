Castles of red gold and green
Falling without warning uselessly

Waking to a standstill
In my backyard
I have watched it whither
Can nature carry on

Ivy with a dew covered train
Reaching to the treetops stretched in vain

Waking to a standstill
In my backyard
I have watched it whither
Can nature carry on

Empire of the green hand
Was a sacred thing
I have watched it whither
Can nature carry on
