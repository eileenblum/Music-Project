While sitting under shady trees
Like those who where there before me
I whittle out of this old tree
A singer of grace and beauty

Throughfields It will cry out your name
And spell out your future in flames
While stirring the pastures beyond
A misty terrain of mountains

Listen closely to the blowing of the wind
It's the whisper of Aengus Og

A passage to antiquity a relic to all that can see

With each pass I'm shedding it's skin
It breathes now with my heart within

Through fields it will cry out your name
And misty terrain of mountain

Listen closely to the blowing of the wind
It's the whisper of Aengus Og
