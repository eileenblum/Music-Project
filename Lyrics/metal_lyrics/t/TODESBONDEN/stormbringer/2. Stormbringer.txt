Upon the tranquil sea
A ship is sailing softly
And on it's deck there sits
A man with wishful thinking
He lays his body down
And stares up at the night sky
And with the passing wind
He sends out his message

I wish for things long gone
I want to be where I'm not
If I could have one wish
I'd wish for a storm

On a blackened plane
With an empty sigh
He reaches for a star
But catches an evening bird
With one touch of her wing
He learns to fly with the storm
