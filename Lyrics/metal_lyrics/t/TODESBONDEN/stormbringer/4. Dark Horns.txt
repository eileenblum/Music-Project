Thunderous raging clouds
Move fast with the wind
It calls to me, it calls
Like the voice of past
Showing me my pain
I moved on, I moved on

Floating with the leaves
Falling at your feet
I bowed to you, I bowed
And like the rising sun
In ambers flames of red
I felt your soul and fled

But all my fears are gone now
My hands are yours to hold
And I'll stand here alone
Until we meet once more

Dark horns cry in vain
Until will meet again

It calls, it calls, it calls
