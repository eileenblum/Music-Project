When hope has faded
The road goes on and on
Wrong decisions made
In each and every crossroads
Like a living dead
Deprived of all emotions
Someone else instead
Decides my destiny
Sorrow remains
It's branded into my soul
Never lets me go
Dreams die young within me
Sorrow as company
Along this narrow path
I've learned to know the unknown
The only friend I have
Reveals it's unseen face
I walk along with sorrow
Each footstep echoes pain
Still I want to follow
Wherever it make take me


Thanks to Matthew_Haumschild for correcting track #10 lyrics.
