Anything for a high
Treason and lies
Don't care about the payback
Don't care about the price
Words without a meaning
Staring glassy eyes
Shaking human wreck
See through liquid lies
A shot is all it takes
To life you from the low
It's not the right way
But on and on you go
Ripping wounds wide open
Give it all you got
There's nothing left to say
Erase the sinner's blood
Ripping wounds wide open
Give it all you got
Poison words and life astray
Addicted to the rush
Playing with the devil
Addicted to the rush
There is no other way
Blood runs poisonous
But on and on you go
Show me your face
Under the mask
Show me who you really are
I know there's more to you
