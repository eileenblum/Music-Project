Where ever you will fall
I'll be there I will follow
Never let you fall alone

We thought we bled all we had
But out momentary joy was a lie
And heavenly moments never last
In the grave of our souls hope lies buried
Wasting time in our sweet wicked circle
Life's just a pain we go through
With broken wings me and you

No salvation in view
No angels on our shoulders
Only wolves howling beyond our walls

We thought we bled all we had
But out momentary joy was a lie
And heavenly moments never last
In the grave of our souls hope lies buried
Wasting time in our sweet wicked circle
Life's just a pain we go through
With broken wings me and you
There's no way out
