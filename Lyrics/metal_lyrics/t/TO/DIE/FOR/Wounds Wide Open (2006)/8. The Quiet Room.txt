I sit and I wait
In the quiet room
Cover my face with my hands
I've been here for hours
But nobody comes I know you are gone
'cause it's taking too long
For someone to bring me the news
'cause somehow I know I've already lost you
Alone in the quiet room
At home it's more quiet without you
I knew this day would come
For me it came too soon
Alone in the quiet room
At home it's more quiet without you
A knock at the door I stand up in fright
Somebody finally came
He says he is sorry
Did all that they could
But your life they couldn't save
I let my tears flow
'cause somehow I knew
I knew I had already lost you
