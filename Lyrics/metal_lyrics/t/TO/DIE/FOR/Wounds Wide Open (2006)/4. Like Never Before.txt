I've seen the rain and the sun
Some I've lost some I have won
Some I've destroyed and saved
I'm digging a grave for myself
I am not afraid
Roses will bloom and roses will fade
Follow me into damnation
(I'll rock your world down there)
Fly with me into the skies
(I'll show you heaven)
Cry or laugh it's all the same
(Hey, no one will care)
The world keeps turning anyway
My soul is aching
Like never before
Tonight I'm so alive
Dance with me now
Like never before
'cause we never know
About tomorrow
No matter what it takes
As long as blood runs in my veins
My candle will burn from both ends
I'm digging a grave for myself
I am not afraid
Roses will bloom and roses will fade
Of dream and reality
