The darkness whispers death
Shadows gain upon me
Running out of breath
Can't control the fear
Feels like someone's watching
Hiding in the dark
Silent echoes screaming
Paralyze my heart
Hey! Leave me alone in the darkness
Leave me alone with my sin
Nothing can save this heartless soul
This guilt ridden state I'm in
Isolation comforts me
Solitude brings safety
Pointing fingers blaming me
For something I didn't do
The blood on my hands ain't mine
I don't know where I've been
Did I cross the line
Of dream and reality
