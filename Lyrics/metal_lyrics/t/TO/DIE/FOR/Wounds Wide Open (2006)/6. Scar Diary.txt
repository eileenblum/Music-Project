See my life written all over my arms
White strokes of misery
I call 'em diary, some call 'em scars
Each one holds a memory
I' I make my last entry, this one sums them all
Last word I carve is too deep
No, no one will miss me, no one at all
Lay down and forever sleep
So many chapters, of pain and regret
So many years spent in sin
Entries of sadness, of tears that I've shed
Eternally carved on my skin
