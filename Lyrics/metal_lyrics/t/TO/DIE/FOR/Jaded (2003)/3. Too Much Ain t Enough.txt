All I need is anything that makes me feel alive
To end this pain and suffering that others may call life
And when the wave comes crushing in i cry from within

Too much ain't enough

I reach the peak of ecstasy
My way back down begins
So much for the luxury
It's payback time for sins

Another wasted youth
Another way to get kicks to escape the truth

Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough

I don't regret
I won't forget
The vivid high I never thought that I could get

The highest high
The lowest low
The mirror lies and never lets me go

Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough

Too much ain't enough
It's not enough
Too much ain't enough
It's not enough

Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
Too much ain't enough
