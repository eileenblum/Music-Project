She's by the window alone
Silently crying
Mourning the love that is gone
Desperately denying

Tears run down her face
Like the rain
Been crying now for days
Plaintive need to let go

I tried to tell you something more
But my silence tells you more
I don't love you anymore

I tried to tell you something more
But my silence tells you more
I don't love you anymore

Her blood runs down the drain
Like a river
Gave in to the pain
Strongest of emotions

I tried to tell you something more
But my silence tells you more
I don't love you anymore...

She realize the other side - no need to cry
It's all behind the frost tears that tear his eye...

Silence tells more...
