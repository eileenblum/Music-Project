[Bonus Track]

No one here to take away
The pain I'm going through
No one here to share
This moment
Empty walls stare back at me
Laughing at my pain
I can't face reality
Can't face tomorrow
I've bid my last farewell
I've shed my final tear
And cast aside the fear
I've bid my last farewell
I've shed my final tear
And cast aside the fear
The scars were never healed
I have hidden my despair
When I pulled the shortest straw
No one even cared
Empty walls stare back at me
Laughing at my pain
I can't face reality
Can't face tomorrow
There's nothing more to give
I've bid my last farewell
I've shed my final tear
And cast aside the fear
I've bid my last farewell
I've shed my final tear
And cast aside the fear


Thanks to hallowed for correcting these lyrics.
