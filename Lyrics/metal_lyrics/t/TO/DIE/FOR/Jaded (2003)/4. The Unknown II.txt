So much has changed since the last time we met
Dreams turned to ashes in the bonfire of regret
The bringer of misfortune the other one inside me
Has finally taken over the one with sanity

Nothing else but trouble nothing left to gain
All I want a painless end to conclude this endless pain

Tomorrow the unknown awakens me from dreaming
Tells me there's no smile that really has a meaning
Tomorrow the unknown awakens me from dreaming
Tells me there's no smile that really has a meaning

So much has changed since the last time we met
Dreams turned to ashes in the bonfire of regret
Nothing else but trouble nothing left to gain
All I want a painless end to conclude this endless pain

Tomorrow the unknown awakens me from dreaming
Tells me there's no smile that really has a meaning
Tomorrow the unknown awakens me from dreaming
Tells me there's no smile that really has a meaning...
