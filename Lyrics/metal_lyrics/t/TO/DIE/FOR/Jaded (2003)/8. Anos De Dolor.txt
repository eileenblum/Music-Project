A shattered man that's what I am
It never was the plan
Drowned in lies whith despise
Bitterness is no surprise

I lost my future lost my hope
Day by day I try to cope
Emptiness spreads from within
The walls are closing in

Just ignore me I don't care
If I die I am prepared

In years of hate I lost my everything
The only way is down
In tears of rage I drown my every sin
In tears of rage I am

Empty walls keep staring back
Best friends that I ever had
To hell whith all your sympathy
It's all the same to me

Just ignore me I don't care
If I die I am prepared

Now it's too late
The walls are closing in

In years of hate I lost my everything
The only way is down
In tears of rage I drown my every sin
In tears of rage I'm flow

In years of hate I lost my everything
The only way is down
In tears of rage I drown my every sin
In tears of rage I'flow...drown, rage I drown
