Misery loves company
And you're the chosen one
It doesn't let you go
Until it loves you to numb

You were searching for something
Something you don't know
You've been lost so long
Cannot find the light anymore

Remember the days
Your heart felt sympathy and love
Now your mind is dull
So lifeless

Whatever you do wherever you go
Misery will follow
Needs you everyday like a desert needs the rain
Your sinner soul keeps it alive

You try to run away
Away from your hell
&gt;From your inner cell
What you never thought to know

Misery loves company
And you're the choosen one
It doesn't let you go
Now it loves you to numb

Remember the days
Your heart felt sympathy and love
Now your mind is dull
So lifeless

Whatever you do wherever you go
Misery will follow
Needs you everyday like a desert needs the rain
Your sinner soul keeps it alive

Whatever you do wherever you go
Misery will follow
Needs you everyday like a desert needs the rain
Your sinner soul keeps it alive
