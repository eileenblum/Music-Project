It's the hour of fading light embers of my life
Save me from myself
You touched the fire and took it out of me
The flame is gone for all eternity

Nothing can hurt me i'm safe within your grace
Whatever comes our way you will protect me
You gave me something more precious than this life
You touched the fire and took it out of me

After all I still believe in life and blood relation
I know I'm drained of both
Now it's all the same to me
I'm safe in isolation surrounded by your love

With a silent whisper you came from the dark
Left me whith splinters of my shattered heart
With a silent whisper you came from the dark
Left me whith splinters of my shattered heart

After all I still believe in life and blood relation
I know I'm drained of both
Now it's all the same to me
I'm safe in isolation surrounded by your love
