I see through your eyes, I feel your fears
I hear your heart beating, I've been crying your tears
You are all I have, all I fight for
I'll give you a little piece of moon
I'll stop the rain for you when there's monsoon
Into the death I was born, life I became
With you... with you

WITH YOU!

I'll leave my heart with you so, don't ever cry
If I go tomorrow it would never be goodbye
I won't be far away, for life goes on
If you need me just call
And I will come, I'll be there for you
Into the death I was born, life I became
With you

I see through your eyes, I feel your fears
I hear your heart beating, I've been crying your tears
You are all I have, all I fight for
I'll give you a little piece of moon
I'll stop the rain for you when there's monsoon
Into the death I was born, life I became
