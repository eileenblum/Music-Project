[In loving memory of Tonmi Lillman]

Drums fell silent in the bonfire of vanity
Sometimes it's hard to believe in humanity
One fine morning, endless pain
Came to a close with a painless end
Goodbye my friend

We played games of fire, we had our dreams
But sorrow of the unknown smoldered within
Heaven didn't stop raining, stars fell from the sky
You had your moments but you deserve more

NOW YOU'RE IN THE UNKNOWN
YOUR NAME'S WRITTEN IN STONE
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU REALLY HAD MEANING
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES... SOMETIMES I STILL
GET WRAPPED UP IN THE FEELING
I DON'T BELONG HERE

With aching soul just run away
It's better to be on the way than stay
How come I'm still here
Where the flames feels cold
And home doesn't feel like home
