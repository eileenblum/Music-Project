We create these heels and lands of dreams
On a ride on a sorrow's stream
And everything feels as fatal as it seems
Will I leave these tears behind
Will I lose time out of my mind
When spirits come and shake me up

WE ARE ALL ONE
WE ARE EVERYTHING
IN ETERNITY WHERE
NOTHING ENDS
NOTHING BEGINS...

Death is only a lie
But no one tells why
Material dream makes us blind
Will I leave these tears behind
Will I lose time out of my mind
When spirits come and shake me up

WE ARE ALL ONE
WE ARE EVERYTHING
IN ETERNITY WHERE
NOTHING ENDS
NOTHING BEGINS...
