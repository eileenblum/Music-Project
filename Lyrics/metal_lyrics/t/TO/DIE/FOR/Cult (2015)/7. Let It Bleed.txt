MY STAR BEYOND THE NIGHT TAKE ME AWAY
LET THERE BE LIGHT OF ETERNAL DAWN... IN THE END
DON'T YOU TRY TO HEAL MY WOUNDS; JUST LET 'EM BLEED
TIL THE LAST DROP AND AFTER IT ALL I'M FREE, I'M CLEAN

Ruthless and icy cuts wounds into my feet
Let 'em bleed
I'm numb, so numb, need to get away from here
My time has come
I've been loved, I've been hater
Now roses have faded

MY STAR BEYOND THE NIGHT TAKE ME AWAY
LET THERE BE LIGHT OF ETERNAL DAWN... IN THE END
DON'T YOU TRY TO HEAL MY WOUNDS; JUST LET'EM BLEED
TIL THE LAST DROP AND AFTER IT ALL I'M FREE, I'M CLEAN

The end will be as in the beginning
Beautiful as the heartbreaking melody
Now, come here my death
My new beginning
My new hope
