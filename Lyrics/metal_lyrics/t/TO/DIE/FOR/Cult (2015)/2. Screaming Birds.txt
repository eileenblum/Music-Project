Call of the wild and I will fall
Into the flames, rain and storm
It's beautiful depravity
Sweet destructive humanity
I hurt myself just to become whole again
Time after time, again and again
I drink myself to sleep just to forget for a while
Till the dawn shows all these injuries

TEAR MY HEART OFF MY CHEST
FEED IT TO THE SCREAMING BIRDS
MAY THE SUN PARCH MY CORPSE
WITH NOTHING I CAME WITH NOTHING I'LL LEAVE

Life's such a bitch and life's a whore
Misery we adore
Like state of decline, like a dream
On the waves of eternity
I hurt myself just to become whole again
Time after time, again and again
I drink myself to sleep just to forget for a while
Till the dawn shows all these injuries

I propose a toast for sorrow, two for joy
And for the fellting moment misery feels easy
