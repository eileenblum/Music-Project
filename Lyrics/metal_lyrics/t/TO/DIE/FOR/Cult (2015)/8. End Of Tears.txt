LAND OF DEATH SALUTES YOU!
We're the breath of the wind, the highs and lows
We're the end, we're all eternity
You're welcome to the vale of crows

We're the freedom, the truth
We're the end of tears

LAND OF DEATH SALUTES YOU!
Come, and I will show you your room
We'll wipe away your pains
We'll wipe away your fears
WE ARE THE END OF TEARS

We are the end, we are all eternity
WE ARE THE END OF TEARS
LAND OF DEATH SALUTES YOU!
LAND OF DEATH SALUTES YOU!
