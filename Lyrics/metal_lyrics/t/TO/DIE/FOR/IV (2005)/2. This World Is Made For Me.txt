Can't lay my heart to rest 
I'm filthy and unkind 
I'm heartless 
A disbeliever and unclean 
Nothing is what it seems 
I'm a liar 
I'm here in the right place 
This world belongs... 
...for the restless 
For the anxious and for the hopeless 
For the heartless 
...this world is made for me... 
Quiet conscience sleeps through thunder so they say 
But I'm alright 
I'll be punished later so they say but why should I care 
I'm a winner right here
