Can't find a reason you should respect in me 
you're happy when you get me on my knees 
hate me, hurt me, kill me 
do whatever you want 
why should I care? 
--I'm not the one who?ll lose-- 
--I'm not the one who surrenders-- 
I am what I am 
is it so hard to understand? 
I'm the king on my land 
hate me, hurt me, kill me 
think about me what you want 
you cannot trample me under your feet. 
HURT ME ONCE HURT ME TWICE 
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO CRIES 
LATER IT'S YOU WHO FEELS PAIN 
KILL ME ONCE KILL ME TWICE 
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO DIES 
MY LIFE IS FULL OF LITTLE DEATHS 
I WILL BE BORN AGAIN.
