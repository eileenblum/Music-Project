Life, like a poison in me 
Destroyed my innocence and dreams 
I've been told life is the gift 
Oh, that gift makes me sick! 
Smiling faces, those happy ones 
I feel nothing 
I'm totally numb 
But in the silence of the night-time with you 
I can feel momentary warmth 
You are too much for me to lose 
Endlessly I love you 
My blood still runs just because of you 
You are too much for me to lose 
Endlessly I love you 
You're my shine 
You're my rain 
When comes the day of my destiny 
Without you I won't leave 
You're the shining light in the middle of the dark 
You're the rain in my withered heart
