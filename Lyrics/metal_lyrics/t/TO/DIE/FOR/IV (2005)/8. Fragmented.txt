Dead like a stone 
A withered rose 
A weak soul 
...and broken bones 
Fragments in the middle of the crowd 
Do you know the feeling I'm telling about 
When a peace of mind can never be found? 
I ran too close to the sun 
I flied too high 
The threshold of life is too fragile 
I'm fragmented and lost 
My blood still runs 
But it feels too cold 
Should I give up, give up, give up? 
Should I be gone? 
Burning fast from both ends 
The racking hours come again and again 
Fragile that's all I am 
Hey! Was I born to suffer? 
Did I ask to be born at all? 
Life is ripping my heart out!
