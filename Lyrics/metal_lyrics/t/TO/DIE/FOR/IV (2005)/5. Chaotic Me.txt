Salvation what it is? 
Quiet conscience and creed? 
I'm too lost to be saved. 
I've done what I've done, 
Never dreamt about babylon I've built my own heaven!! 
Save yourself if that's what you want? 
I feel powerful to be CHAOTIC ME! 
THERE'S NO GODS IN MY NIGHTS AND DAYS 
I'M MY BIGGEST LORD AND I ALWAYS WILL BE 
YOUR RELIGION IS NOT FOR ME! 
I'VE BUILT MY OWN WORLD 
SWEET CHAOTIC ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I'm guilty alone,when something goes wrong! 
It's not the punishment from gods. 
Conscience doesn't bother me about yesterday 
...I'm proud of myself 
I'm too lost to be saved..lost in my nights and days 
I obey my own rules 
Sweet rules that I've made 
Salvation what it is? nothing but a piece of shit 
MY HEAVEN IS REAL.........MY HEAVEN IS REAL!!
