Here comes the dawn of a new day 
Comes without a light, it's grey 
Grey as yesterday 
The frozen ground keeps sleeping 
Under my feet 
Everything feels cold 
It's my inner fear 
Could you save me 
Break the chains around my heart 
Set me free 
Let me breathe and let me fly 
Away, away 
Faces look cruel in the twilight 
No smiles for anyone 
Darkness has captured my mind 
It's eternal autumn 
Lives in me 
No place to hide 
No place to escape (I've tried!) 
I'm not strong enough to run
