No turning back 
I will fall 
No-one can catch me 
I'll break my own bones 
My soul is ruined can't you see 
I'm dead like a stone 
Living dead as they say 
Show me how to live 
No... still you can't save me 
(Even you can't stop me) 
Watch me now 
And how I'm sliding down 
Into the stream of eternity 
Someday 
You will follow 
You'll fall like I do 
Like I do now! 
Can't find a thing that I could respect inside me 
My innocence was too fragile 
It withered away 
I don't want to paint life in rosy colours 
No turning back 
How sad... it is not what I wanted
