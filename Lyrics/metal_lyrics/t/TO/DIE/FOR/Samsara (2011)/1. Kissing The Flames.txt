Wind blows through the bones
Innocence will die in our souls
While we're sharing our love
Sweet smell of herbs and taste of tequila on our lips
And we will share our love

Sing a song for our freedom
Write love letters for the fire
Shell we dance for self-destruction
Shell we make love for our lives

Yeah!

Weâre kissing the flames
Living on the edge
When our lives are done weâll say we had our fun, yeah
Weâre floating around the pool of madness
Weâre on fire-fire-fire

Drown into illusion, drown into illusion
Gods are too tired to share their grace with the wicked
How many nails until my coffin is closed?

Sing a song for our freedom
Write love letters for the fire
Shell we dance for self-destruction
Shell we make love for our lives

Yeah!

Weâre kissing the flames
Living on the edge
When our lives are done weâll say we had our fun, yeah
Weâre floating around the pool of madness
Weâre on fire-fire-fire
