[Dedicated to Artsi Peratalo and Marko Weckman R.I.P.]

We're all children until the end
We're drifting around with the fire in our eyes
We barely see the road behind these flames
Where the road turns and where it ends
Beautiful things will turn to rust
Meadow of roses is unreal

My brother - my brother!
We're from the same blood
I'm with you where ever you are
My friend - where ever you are my friend
With our insatiable hearts
We're still here and you are the star

Beautiful thins will turn to rust
Meadow of roses is unreal
We barely see the road behind these flames
Where the road turns and where it ends

My brother - my brother!
We're from the same blood
I'm with you where ever you are
My friend - where ever you are my friend
With our insatiable hearts
We're still here and you are the star
Yet comes a day when we'll meet again
Yet comes a day when we'll meet again

Someday, somewhere
Someday, somewhere
Someday, somewhere
Somehow
