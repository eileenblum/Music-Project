How can I exist in the same
World with you my brightness
Loving you - keeping you
Deep in my darkness

There's something in my chest
To which thy light bring no rest
In silence my heart raves
Read the pain from my face

As the day and the night we are
But love's unconditional
Shadows in my heart
And innocentâthat's what you are

There's something in your chest
To which my darkness bring no rest
In silence your heart raves
I see that pain on your face

Rapture and heartaches
The devil and the saint
The devil and the saint

You are the one who can fly too close the sun
But itâs not gonna burn you up
Youâre my beloved â my belovedâ¦ but

There's something in my chest
To which thy light bring no rest
In silence my heart raves
Read the pain from my face

Rapture and heartaches
The devil and the saint

Your brightness will make me blind
For you my darkness is like poisoned wine
With our raving hearts we will share our love
