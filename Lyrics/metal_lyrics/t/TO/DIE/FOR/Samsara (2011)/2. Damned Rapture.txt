As the earthworm burrows into the ground
I will burrow into your heart
Like a cancer I'm there
It may hurt you, yeah, I know, I know, I know,
But that's what sickly deep love's doing
I'll die in peace with you
In love, in freedom

You may be just someone for the rest of the world
For me you are the whole world
Blessed be my damned rapture
It's all about love
It's all about...
It's all about you
I'll die in peace with you
In love, in freedom

I'm a knife in your heart!
