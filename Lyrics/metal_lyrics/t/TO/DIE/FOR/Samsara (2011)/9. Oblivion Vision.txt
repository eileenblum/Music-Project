What are these scents around me?
What is this silence and peace?
Faceless light keeps me on its arms
And sings me into the deepest dream

Yesterday is history and tomorrow is unknown
Wow, here I am in a moment with my aching soul
I saw you there... you!... mistake
I... saw you thereâ¦ mistake

Oh, ah, I saw you there...
But I saw you there...

What are these scents around me?
What is this silence and peace?
Faceless light keeps me on its arms
And sings me into the deepest dream
