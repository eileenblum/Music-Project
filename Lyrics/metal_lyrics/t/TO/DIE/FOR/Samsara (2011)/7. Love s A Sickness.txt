Like a warm and gentle breeze of Arambol your love is
Like a Parisian night or under the Mexican sun
It's in your love I'll become intoxicated

Ah-ah
Love's a sickness that I adore
A tormenting drug that I am craving for more

Like a soporific dream like a formidable scream
You love is...
I'm symptomatic of restlessness and chaos
In your love I'll be subordinate
For love's the devil and love's the saint.

Love's a sickness that I adore
A tormenting drug that I am craving for more
Love's a cancer deep in my heart
Oh, your love is
Love just is...

Love's a sickness that I adore
A tormenting drug that I am craving for more
Love's a cancer deep in my heart
Oh, your love is
Love just is...

Love's a sickness
Love's a cancer
Oh, your love is
Love just is...


Symphony of our souls - symphony of our souls
It's ugly and it's divine
Symbiosis of hearts - symbiosis of hearts
Only death will tear us apart, yeah-yeah.
