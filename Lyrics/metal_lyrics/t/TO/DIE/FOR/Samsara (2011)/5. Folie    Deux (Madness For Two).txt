In our world no one else
Me and you
Folie Ã¡ deux
While you're sleeping I'm awake
I'm driving all shadows away
And when I bleed you're bleeding my blood

Dead line stone are those bitter hearts
Who haltingly live in their golden houses of cards
But all eternity belongs to you and me
You are all I have... you are all I have
All I need
I'm crying your tears and you cry mine
If anyone comes between us
We' ll make them all die
The world around us
Hates us
Weâre unique - me and you
Folie Ã¡ deux

Come train and drive us away
Away from misery bay
And weâll jump out at station of freedom

Dead line stone are those bitter hearts
Who haltingly live in their golden houses of cards
But all eternity belongs to you and me
You are all I have... you are all I have
All I need

Dead line stone are those bitter hearts
Who haltingly live in their golden houses of cards
But all eternity belongs to you and me
You are all I have... you are all I have
All I, all I need
