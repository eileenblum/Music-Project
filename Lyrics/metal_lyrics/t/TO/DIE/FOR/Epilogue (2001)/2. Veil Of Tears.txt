Old souls are rambling
Through your room
'Cause night-time belongs to them
Time of shadows and whispers
Your room is so dark
And you are
Too scared to fall asleep
But I'm always there for you

So warm is my heart for you my love

Sleep well my darling
And leave
This vale of tears behind
Land of nod is a better place
Don't feel fear in the darkness
You can't see
But there I am with you
I'm near, close to you

The night is calling
