Come and drown with me
In the sea of apathy
Deeper in we're drawn
On this downward spiral

We passed the point of no return
The moment we intertwined
On the shores of misery
Washed by crimson tide

Blood is what unites
Crimson twins we are
Blood is what unites
Our darkened hearts

Death is not what it seems
It's just a new beginning
For a lifetime of pain
Until we die again
