Cold wind blows again tonight
Caressing total silence
Darkness wraps us in it's veil
As we open our eyes

In the moonlight our souls are free
On wings of sorrow we face eternity

Frozen leaves for our bed
And mist for a blanket
It's time to rise into the night
And satisfy the need

Evil lives within our hearts
Where no blood resides
Once awaken cannot sleep
'Til hunger satisfies
