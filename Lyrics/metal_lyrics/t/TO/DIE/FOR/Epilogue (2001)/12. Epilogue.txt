Now I write this final letter
To whom it may concern
It is time to close a chapter
The last one in this world

Soon as I'm done writing
It's time for me to go
I make the final cut
And let the red stream flow

I'm thrown in death's embrace
I feel its soothing warmth
Calmess on my face
I close my eyes for evermore

Down the road to the unknown
I walk the narrow
And I feel the comfort
Of leaving life behind

Soon as I'm done walking
I've left the world behind
