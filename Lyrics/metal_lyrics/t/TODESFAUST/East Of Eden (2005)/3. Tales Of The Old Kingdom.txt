[Lyrics: Murezor]

I bring the plagues of Egypt
The locusts and the dark
Parasites and rivers turned to blood

The twelve flames have withered and died
Gone are the angels by their side
They have all gone to hell
Bewitched by Azazel

The wailing women weep no longer
The clothes once torn have been repaired
Seven days for those not here
That our eyes may run with tear
