[Lyrics: Roanoz and Murezor]

Release me unto thy sin
The holy father burns within
Breeching is the light above
The coven is one and we will prevail

Feast your eyes upon the place of skull
Where your king was crucified
Nailed to the cross and drenched in blood
"Death" for he has lied

The tears upon the dirt float towards the purest light
And we encounter the shadows that we've seen before
We have covered ourselves for so long in eternal night
You look unto the slope that crumbles with the weight of His majesty

We are the keepers of a shallow eminence
That hold the key to mankinds fall
Throughout the age of innocence
We've come for vengence once more

Feast your eyes upon the place of skulls
Where your king was crucified
Nailed to the cross and drenched in blood
"Death" for he has lied
