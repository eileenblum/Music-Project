[Lyrics: Murezor]

Evil comes on wings of obsidian,
Death follows close behind,
I am one with the forces of darkness,
Behold my kin and kind,
I am disease and pain,
I am the son of the evil one
I have come

All evil in this world bows down before his might,
He is the mask of death,
His is the face of terror,
One that should be revered
One of enormity
We shall hymn his exalted being
Never-ending praise for him, the Evil One
