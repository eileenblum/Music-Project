[Lyrics: Roanoz and Murezor]

Through might he walks
The earth his lair
A shadow built by past
A truth lies north
The man once said
Ice has covered vengeance

We ride through rain and sudden storm
To the lakes of waning moons
Reflections tear the bravest eyes
For we must toast the sky tonight

A throne of frost awaits us
To conquer and regain

Relinquishment of my former God
