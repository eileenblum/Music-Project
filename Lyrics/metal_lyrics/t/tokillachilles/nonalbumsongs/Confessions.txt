Oh I've heard this all before
this is your confessions
and I've, I've seen these days change
but we remain the same
Oh!

We don't know where we are,
but we know where we're going
Oh, where were going

So how long have you been searching?
To find yourself again
So how long have you been searching?
To find yourself again, to find yourself again.

She's choking on her own fear
But I have no time to be listening
I know where I stand
cause she left me standing here

We'll go around in circles
but we're only chasing shadows
[X2]

We'll go the depth and the distance, we'll make it to the end
[X6]

To the end

You killed hope, but I buried it, This is your confession.
