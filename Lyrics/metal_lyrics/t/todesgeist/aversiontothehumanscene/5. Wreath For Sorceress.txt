Daughter of woods and secret mountains
Sister of all wood creatures
Friend of owls flying in dusk
At the hour when Gates are opened

In the night of forbidden love
I gave you wreath woven of dark flowers
Flowers from beyond unseen threshold
Saying: "You love opens me last knowledge"

Trees and glasses bowed before you
Rocks diverged and showed you their secrets
Demons from abyss and creatures from Grimland
Carried their gifts to drop before your eyes

On ancient chancels of forgotten gods
We made our love refuting hypocritical dogmas
And faded heavenly bodies opened for us their shining
And came to life

But step by step mind which thirsting unknown
Devoured your soul and body
Spirits of damned places asked for sacrifice
And you faded away

I left you lying upon the damned stones
Their unholy signs were your favorite reading
But every night in stifling dream
You come to leave me your wreath

I find it every morning near my head
Flowers of forbidden knowledge
Pregnant with seeds of death
And I know how me to join you...

Only to put on the wreath
And we will be together
In gray mist of ruined worlds
And I can't resist MEET ME!
