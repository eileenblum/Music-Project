Formerly I was trying to embrace the whole earth
Elements spirits were my obedience arms
But now my lot is to sleep in my dreams to forget
Who I used to be...
Awaking with owl cry
Which is calling something dead for long ago
By depression breaks my calm's amber
Life I should to go with you again
But I strongly cling to my slumber
My flesh bleeds with fear in front of dark shining
Of timeless gape of eternity but my soul
Is carried out with ethereal winds
Retention of sleep is the shelter of mine
No sunfall no dawn
Until I'm forced to awake and buried in sun
Touch the cold of my skin
Dusted with reverie
Listen to my breath's crying outwards:
"When I sleep I'm free"
I travel by thoughts without borders
Within heart of all things
My blood transforms into the wandering lights
When the shapes becomes dim
Emptiness of my mind contains all the things
All kinds of living all spirits of dead are within my soul...
Dressed in misery
Foreclosed of terrestrial values
Of my own history
I drawn into mysterious endlessness
Glare of ecstasy
During instant of reunion
With the universe sea
In front of grandeur
Of persistent revelation
Returning to human scene
Is embodiment of blasphemy
