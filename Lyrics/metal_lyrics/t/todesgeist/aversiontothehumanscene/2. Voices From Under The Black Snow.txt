This day is completed with awaking of me
Dreams turned in side out become a real thing
Darkened wood of little Christian church
Profanes this clear snow
Only dusk breaks its shadow seal
Opens the way to go out from under the snow
I fall out from the womb of twilight into this night
Your bodies are only vessels which are
Shining red spiced with souls
Your blood is satisfaction for my hate not for my hurt
But mighty someone draws me out of here into nowhere
I belong to forgotten past and nothing can change my nature
I am miserable for myself but pride
Doesn't let me stop my vengeance
I hate you all gathering under icons of other god
I hate your filthy blood you were guilty to my thirst
I'll take all the blood of your unbaptized sons
And daughters of yours will take all your blood
Memory shells down like dried up dye
My idols have already mouldered away
My pagan temples don't hear the voices
To worship me only blood is to stay
I'm glad when you bleed
Among your dying sons
And none of you will be forgiven by God
I fall out from the darkest prejudice into your life
My eyes are always watching you through the river ice
Your blood is satisfaction for my hate not for my hurt
But mighty someone draws me out of here into nowhere
And your lot is to wait for my seed's growing up
And your calm life will turn into your Biblical Inferno...
