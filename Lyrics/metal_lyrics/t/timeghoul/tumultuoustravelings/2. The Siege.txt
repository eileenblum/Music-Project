Look over the battlements
At the burning countryside
There the army of wicked madness
Besieges this castle of will

Feel the frozen wind
From the bleak outer world
The banner twists in agony
Tortured from the world around
The wind seeps through the walls
Whispering revelations of despair
It skulks in high lofted ceilings
A messenger of the fallen realm

The moat displays whitened bloated corpses
A cesspool where the slain float
For miles back their casualties are strewn
Ours burn on pyres smoke replacing sky

Listen to the sound of the pounding
Battering rams
Their black winged echoes
Fly down these desolate halls
Each catapult stone defeats the walls
We labor to repair what falls upon us
The bringers of insanity
Dance bizarrely
In celebration
Of their coming conquest

Look and see their campfires
Like obscene stars fallen to the ground
Wallow in dread at the moment's peace
For the battle always resumes

No shining army will rush to our aid
We are to die in this crumbling tomb
I'm being driven mad
Specters of bitterness and confusion
Circle my head
The mist goes in my ears and exits my mouth
And within they destroy all they can

The bringers of lunacy have breached the walls
Remnants of innocence put to the sword
Engulfed into the kingdom of the mad
My psyche lays in ruins but now I'm born
