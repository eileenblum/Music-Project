Here my bones bleach
Before the blazing light of purity
Chained to the mountain top
The waste of heaven falls upon me
My wrists are a grisly red
From the bonds of justice
Now I understand
Why men look to the ceaseless sky

I toyed with the mortal gift of thought
I pondered through the ruins of mystery
I scoffed at the altar of solace
In the ruins I dreamt nothing
I raised my lance to the sky
Curing those dust covered statues
Then a raindrop stuck brow
And the oceans of the sky fell

The mountains sank into the sea
The crumbling earth had betrayed me
Fleeing to nowhere sanctuary barred
The rainwound begins to bleed

Grim haunts of the heavens and hells
Emerged from the cracks in the sky and the rocks
A mob of fiends encircled me
Through undivine ascension I was taken to the gods

I was made to kneel
Before the gods
Their stares peeled flesh and bone
Bludgeoning my soul
For insolence in denial
I was to make penance
And my legacy was to grasp my kind

On the mountaintop I was put
An iron chain bore into the wound
Linking my mind with the heavens above
Forever thought was taken from us
