[Music by Holst &amp; Nilsson, Lyrics by Holst]

The full moon is rising over the moor
And I know it will come back to haunt me again

Can you hear it - the calling of the moon?
It is reaching for me now
It's a primal rage building up in me
Cannot stop it to break free

And in its white light there are voices telling me
To kill and eat is my destiny
Just when I thought that I had found my place in life
The full moon fever strikes again

Bloodline deceiver this is my call
I am the blazing full moon
Bloodline deceiver I gaze from above
I bring the madness that makes your blood boil

[Chorus:]
Hearts set aflame by the spell of the full moon
A circle of fire that burns in the night
Cannot be stopped it's the curse of werewolf
A child of the night that howl to the moon

I can feel it growing strong the wolf inside of me
Is trying to break free

I have lost myself to lycanthropic rage
I feel the wolf inside of me
No more a man I am the beast is in control
The reign of terror have begun

Bloodline deceiver this is my call
I am the blazing full moon
Bloodline deceiver I gaze from above
I bring the madness that makes your blood boil

[Repeat chorus]

She put a spell on me!
The gypsy girl is laughing, she's dancing in the dark
Will this all be forever or will I one day be set free?

Bloodline deceiver this is my call
I am the blazing full moon
Bloodline deceiver I gaze from above
I bring the madness that makes your blood boil

[Repeat chorus]

Hear the beckon of the bloodline calling
Hear the calling of the blood inside of you

As I stand in wait of dawning, my transformation has begun
In the rain my flesh is changing turning back to what I was

Wolf - Man - Metamorphism
