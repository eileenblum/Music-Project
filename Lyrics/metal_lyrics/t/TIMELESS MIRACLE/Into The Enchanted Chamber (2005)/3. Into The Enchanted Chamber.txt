[Music by Holst &amp; Nilsson, Lyrics by Holst]

Brothers and sisters we're pilgrims of our destiny
Open up your mind and see the truth
We've come for the cleansing to purify our hearts and beliefs
To the well of souls we come again

We turn our backs to modern life bigotry and hate
We praise the new sunrise

Dreamers and thinkers we challenge the world that we despise
Gaze into the lake of tears tonight
History teach us but mankind won't learn from the mistakes
Hatred shape the choices that she makes

Into the womb of mother earth the cradle of all life
We turn our pleading eyes

To the wind and the water to fire and the chamber of our lies
We have come to pay a tribute to the pagan way of life
To the earth and the mountains to the valley of the dead we all have come
To cleans the mind and body of the evil in this world

The heavens are burning the oceans are rising overhead
Thrown we are into the lion's den
Darkness will follow the wake of destruction that we bring
So that we can start to build again

We turn our backs to modern life bigotry and hate
We praise the new sunrise

[Repeat chorus]

Fear not what you feel, death is not the ending
Cause dying is the key to life
Returning to what were, the cycle near completion
The wheel of life goes on and on and on

Into the womb of mother earth the cradle of all life
We turn our pleading eyes

[Repeat chorus]
