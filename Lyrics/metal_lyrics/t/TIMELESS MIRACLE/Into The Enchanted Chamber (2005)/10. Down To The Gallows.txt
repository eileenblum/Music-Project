[Music by Nilsson &amp; Holst, Lyrics by Holst &amp; Nilsson]

By morning light they came to take me away
Their banners swaying in the wind
Out in the rain they dragged me onto the castle yard
I could hear the mocking of the crowd

If only I could I would go back in time
Then I would undo what I've done

The priest gave me my last rites my final sip of wine
Right before my pending end
A growing fear of dying spreading in my soul
Hell or heaven be my guide

With a noose around my neck and with tears in my eyes
I repented the sins of my past

[Chorus:]
Down to the gallows at the end of a rope
I will die as a sinner I'm going
Down to the gallows where so many have died
By the hands of the hangman

They came down the mountains they came down the hills
To see me draw my final breath
Over the rivers over the moors
To see the madman laid to rest

If only I could I would go back in time
Then I would undo what I've done

[Repeat chorus]

The pilgrims riddle is so hard to solve
The answer determines your rise or your fall
Heaven or hell the riddle is for all

The devils dance in brimstone and fire
The angels sing a beckoning call
Heaven or hell the riddle is for all

With a noose around my neck and with tears in my eyes
I repented the sins of my past

[Repeat chorus]
