[Music by Nilsson &amp; Holst, Lyrics by Holst]

In the sunlight I felt the warmth
I was finally free
From the chains that had bound me
In the crypts down below

And the nightmare was over it seemed
I was back on my feel
Standing so proudly covered in dust
But my pride was intact

Where to go I don't know
The world thinks of me dead
It's been awhile since I was here

[Chorus:]
Far Beyond the gates of hell
Tricked the devil broke the spell
Travelled on the river Styx to freedom
Hate and pain I left behind
Done with burning it's my time
To leave the fire gates of hell behind me

Then I saw there was a hole in the sky
God was looking on me
When the angels of mercy appeared
Said its time to leave

Where to go I don't know
The world thinks of me dead
It's been awhile since I was here

[Repeat chorus]

Like a fire burning higher
Like a fire burning up to the night away

[Repeat chorus]
