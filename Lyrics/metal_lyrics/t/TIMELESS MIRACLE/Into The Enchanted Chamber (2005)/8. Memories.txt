[Music by Nilsson &amp; Widfors, Lyrics by Nilsson, Widfors &amp; Holst]

Moments of happiness will they ever come back?
Embraced by darkness now that you are gone
Leaving
Calling out your name

[Chorus:]
In my memories I see you smile
The road to the future was in tour eyes
I can see you like I used to do
In my memories of you

Searching thrum my soul there is nothing inside
Every day time takes its toll
It hurts me so when you say you must go
The love we shared is not coming back

[Repeat chorus]

I saw the light in your eyes
Shining down on me
I saw the light in your eyes
Shining on me

[Repeat chorus]
