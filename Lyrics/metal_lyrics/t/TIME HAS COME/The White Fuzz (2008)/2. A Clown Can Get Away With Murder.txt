I have no desire to reform myself. The only desire is to reform the people. I will rob burn destroy. And kill everybody i can. And everywhere i go. As long as i live. A clown can get away with murder. You hear people. Giving you commands. Threatening you. Laughing at you. You feel as if you are being followed. Violent emotions a mental disorder possession. A clown can get away with murder. The world is getting darker now. I can feel it more and more. If i start to kill people. There will be none of you left. I would cut you with a knife. And watch your face turn real white. A clown can get away with murder. He created you in his own image. He chose the day for you to be born. He has a plan and a purpose for your life. You are the result. Of a gene abnormality present at birth.
