I dont want to sleep tonight. I don't want to sleep alone. Cause i am afraid of all my dreams. All my thoughts. And all my memories. Are my minds worst enemies. Escape from reality. Nothing is what it seems. Just live the illusion. In my flush i fell asleep. And lost my brain. In deepest phantasies. I'm afraid of night. To tired to fight. Ignorance is bliss.
