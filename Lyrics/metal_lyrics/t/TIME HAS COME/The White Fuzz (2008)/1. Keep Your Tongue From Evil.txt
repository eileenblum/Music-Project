Make it big. Make it simple. Keep saying it. And they will believe it. Lie lie lie. In my lifetime i've left pieces. Of my hearts here and there. Now there's barely enough to stay alive. Keep your tongue from evil. Keep your tongue from evil. And your lips from speaking lies. Lies lies lies. People can be affected to see paradise as hell. And in reverse. Consider the most wretched sort of life. As paradise. You can chain me. You can torture me. You can even destroy this body. But you will never imprison my lies. Lies lies lies. ..I wish they would only. Take me as i am.
