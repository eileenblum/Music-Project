This light. Something draws near from nothing. Finally. I am not alone. Dance with me. Through the light. Oh please, carry me. And dance through the light. Baby ravishing beauty. Finally you're with me. You are blinding my senses. Blinded by the light. I can smell you. I can feel you. But i cant see you. Oh please show me the way. Alone i'll fail. And might follow you blindly. On a path. That i don't know yet. I follow the flavor of freedom. Freedom equals bliss? Ignorance equals bliss? The path is endless.
