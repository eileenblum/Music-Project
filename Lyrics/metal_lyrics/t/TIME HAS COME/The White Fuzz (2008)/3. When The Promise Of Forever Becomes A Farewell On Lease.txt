Please let me remember. When we first kissed. I just don't get it. Is this the end? Is this how we say goodbye? Yes. I regret. I regret. I regret. Should've known better. That you were gonna make me cry. Take my face to the inside of love. Nothing to eat but fears in the back. Is this the way it's really going down? It's breaking my heart. To watch you ruin around. May great waves come crashing down. Turn this live around. I built a time machine to escape from. All the pain not left behind. I pray to god that you're right before my. Eyes. 'Cause everything dies babe. And my days are counted. I was ready to give you my name. Can't make it out of here on my own. This life through love so strong. Me and you until the end?
