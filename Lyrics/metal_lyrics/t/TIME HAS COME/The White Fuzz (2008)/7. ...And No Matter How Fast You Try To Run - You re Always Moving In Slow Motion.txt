There is no happiness without tears. No life without death beware! I am going to make you cry. The moment i pushed myself inside of you. You screamed you screamed. You felt like you were being torn open. Closed your eyes and tried to remove yourself. Tried to make it all go away. You started at the darkened windows of the house. And silently prayed someone would wake up. It never happened never. You cried for me to stop. And no matter how fast you try to run. You're always moving in slow motion. Then it was over finally! Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of me. For the lord your god goes with you. He will never leave you nor forsake you.
