Within days. Borne by shifting winds. Radioactive mists spread across the fields. Anxiety. Apprehension. And fear. They suffered. Several deaths. Large scale involuntary irradiation. Due to extensive secrecy. And great economic damage. A zone of alienation. A zone of alienation. A thousand houses. A thousand acres of the land. The abandoned city. The abandoned city. Radiation causes genetic mutations. Wildlife suffered widespread birth defects. And other developmental deformities. A zone of alienation. A zone of alienation. A dozen murders in one second. Just a mouse click from a thousand miles away.
