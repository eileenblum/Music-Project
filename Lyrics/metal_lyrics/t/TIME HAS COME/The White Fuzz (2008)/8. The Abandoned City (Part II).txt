Tens of thousands of people. Lost their homes and livehoods. 4000 estimated cases of thyroid cancer. Are attributed to the radioactive fallout. Everything now stays almost the same. As it was 20 years ago. This is the view. Of totally abandoned city. The abandoned city. A zone of alienation. Nature reclaims. What was originally lost. To urban development. On the edge of destruction. Of your own existence. You are lost children without remorse. Dancing into disaster. On the edge of atomic war. You give way to your illusive peace. Celebrating your sugar-coated world of cheerleaders and tv-stars.
