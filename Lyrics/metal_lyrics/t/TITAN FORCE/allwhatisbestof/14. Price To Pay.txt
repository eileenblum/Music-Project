On a dark and foggy night the moon hands high in the sky.
Quiet streets leave footsteps echoing on in my mind
Something inside of me rages out for release in my sole
Again the full moon tolls.

Try to run, try to hide
From the light of the moon
And its curse it holds on me
With this mark I now bear
Since the day of my birth
It changes me - you don't want to see.

Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
Dagger of silver plunged in my head tis my solemn release.
I suddenly need to feast

I feel a change begin of which I have no control.
That cursed full moonlight tearing into my soul.
Why was I born with a mark - transforms me into a beast.
I suddenly need to feast

Look away, turn and run as fast as you can.
Yours might be the next life gone

Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
Shade of red in my eye, there's no turning back.
And now like a beast I attack
Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
Bullet of silver plunged in my heart 'tis my solemn release -
Seems such a small price to pay.

You hold the key to releasing this spell.
Silver dagger in hand you strike the bell.
With a shattering scream I bid you farewell....

As this mark fades away along with my life.
I can't help feeling free again
Now released from this bond the vexed me so.
Thought I am gone. I am whole
Mark my words. I'll live on, wild an free.
Now that the beast is unchained from me.
