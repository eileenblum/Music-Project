As the lightning cracked the storm began
Spread like fire across the land
A song of freedom for all to hear
One voice aflame to every open ear

Reach for the stars. Reach for it all
The power is in your hands
Shouting out with victory
Voices echo through the land

Rebels of a new age
Together we are one
Pounding out the rhythms
Of a different song
Rebels of a new age
Fighting for a cause
The future is in our hands
This world is ours

Come one. Come all to the pipers tune
There is a new world ahead
And it's coming soon
Bringing a chance as the youth grow strong
Breaking the silence of a deaf world so wrong

Now with minds of metal
And hearts as true as steel
We raise our voices to the sky
New age rebels
Charismatic in our ways
We stand as one
And all else must stand aside!

Coming together millions strong
Right here in this place
Where nothing feels wrong
All for one and one for all
You can joint the ranks
If you heed the call

Gathered together as one we forge a union
Getting stronger stronger than steel
Holding steadfast in your ways
With a taste for victory
We're the founders of a new evolution
