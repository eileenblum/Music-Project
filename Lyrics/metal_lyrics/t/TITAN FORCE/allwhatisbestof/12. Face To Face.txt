As the sun sets low in an eastern sky
As the wall's chipped away from the other side
Homeless are clothed and the hungry fed
As the humble word freedom is blodly said

With our eyes fixed to the stars
There is no stopping us now

Face to face, eye to eye
Hand in hand we touch the sky
Release those bonds let's break those chains
Let your heart fly free again

Give me your tired and your huddled masses
Hungry souls needing to breath free
Chasing a new world at the end of a rainbow
Yes you can have it all just talk to me

Across the world new paths are beaten
Step by step new ideas unfold
People standing true for that they believe in
A new song is sung, a new bell is tolled.
