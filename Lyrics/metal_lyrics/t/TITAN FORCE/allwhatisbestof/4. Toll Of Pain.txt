On a dark summer's night there is something in the air
A chill that surrounds you
Tolling of a bell, screaming in the night (hear it ring)
Struggle with your feelings so much hidden by the past
Now those dreams they come back to haunt you
Tolling a bell, you know it's not the hour
Yet the bell still rings
Gaze into the mirror it's not a pretty sight
Grotesquely twisted as a child I am not a monster
I am not insane. Look away, look away, oh look away

Can't you see his pain ?
I know you hear the pain
In the tolling of the bell
Can't you feel his pain ?
I know you hear the pain

Hatred in their eyes. They lash me with their whips
And their words. Both leave scars on my heart.
Pity on my soul. Won't somebody show some sympathy for me ?
A vision of my dreams. A vision of an angel.
So young. So innocent. So pure.
Never felt this way how can I express this love ?

It's a fatal story. Yes a tragic love affair.
How he gave himself so bravely on that day.
Tell me why pleasure must be followed by pain.
So much pain.
Haunted by their dreams of a thing so pure.
How defiled by their foolish selfish ways.
Tolling of a bell contains a fatal toll.
Oh my soul.
