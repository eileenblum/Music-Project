Come on feel the fire
That burning desire
To lose all control tonight
That feeling of rage
Let it take you away
Let loose that tiger from it's cage 

Nearing the countdown
Living on the edge
Release your desire to fly 

Riding the lightning
Straight to the top
We'll fly on...
Wings of rage
Can't stop this fire
It's burning way too hot
We'll fly on
Wings of rage
Fly high ! 

Oh children of sin
I'll let you all in 
On a secret that we all know
There is a power
Somewhere deep inside
When you find it
Let it go 

Come on and join with the rest
Put your mind to the test
Harness that electric spark
Take on the lead
Get from life what you need
Strive on reach your mark
