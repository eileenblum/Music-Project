Soldiers of fortune
Seeking revenge on the mishaps in life
Beating the odds as the dice roll
The night is their playground
Feeding desires by temptating their souls
As the color of green fades to grey 

Place your bets on lifes wheel
Give a spin
Don't play the fool
Don't play the fool
Fool on the run 

Soldiers of passion
Searching to satisfy more than the mind
One night of pleasure turns into pain
Hearts are too fragile
An easily scarred like diamonds on glass
Love is a gamble someone has to pay 

Living of passion
Searching to satisfy more than the mind
One night of pleasure turns into pain
Hearts are too fragile
An easily scarred like diamonds on glass
Love is a gamble someone has to pay

Living your life in half the time
Always on the edge
You're moving faster than the rest
Does it get you anywhere?
Oh my child with a heart of gold
What's that inside you?
Has the world turned you cold?
Do you see the magic?
I see you felt the pain
You're running nowhere 
Right into the fire again
Reach out and take life
Before it slips away
It's that devil inside you
Slowly making you pay for your dreams
You look like a fool on the run
What are you running for
You fool! 

Soldiers of liberty
You know it all when will you learn ?
Freedom is only a conflict away
This world you desire
It's magic is their open your eyes
Don't confuse your dreams
With what is real. No
