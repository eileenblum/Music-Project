Red skies rage their angry cry upon the battle plains.
Soldiers march into history for a cause unexplained
Yet in every heart, in every man, there is a need to win.
When one dabbles in war games, who's to say what is sin ? 

Fields of valor and victory.
White crosses the bear no name.
Each one gave their life to history.
Fields of valor and victory.
A young boy in an old man's game.
Each one gave their life for a nameless cross. 

Skies bleed pain upon us all as the night comes falling down.
Cries of victory cannot be heard when you're six feet underground.
Yet feel they understand the paths that they have made.
Our children can now run free - price of liberty is paid. 

Turn back the hands of time so i may ask their names.
And place each name upon a stone, to never fade away.
