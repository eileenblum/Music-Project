What is real? What is a dream
Are dreams and reality one and the same
No more roles for me to play
The curtain falls and darkness takes me away
in a cell I scream all through the night
No one hears my cries
Held prisoner of my own mind
Too blind to see behind my own eyes

Ride the mind's eye
Come balance on the edge of reality
Ride the nightmare
Come open the doors of insanity

Puppets on a string, life is but a dream
Magic in the air, feel it everywhere
What am I to care
Take a ride with me, come along you'll see
Fantasy is real close your eyes and feel
That is if you dare
Anything you want, everything you need
You can have it all, but beware the fall
Back into reality

When the pieces start to fall
Your whole world crumbles away
This time it's gone too far
Unreal thoughts you believe are taking you
Taking you away

In this world of darkness, forever floating on and on
Dreams I experience too strong to control
Lead me on a journey of no return
