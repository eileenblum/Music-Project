I am the eyes of the nighttime 
If you gaze into the darkness 
I'll be there 
Go ahead and place your heart 
In my hand 
Take what i need 
And leave you in despair 
Though you turn your eyes 
You can't look away 
You'll be chained to love 
Just like a slave 

I'm the master, master of disguise 
Painting a beautiful picture 
Full of lies 
I'm the master, master of disguise 
I can steal your heart 
Look into my eyes 
I'm the master 
The master of disguise 

Come feel the flames of desire 
Taking you down i get my way 
Tonight 
I see some things are hard to swallow 
A scratch and a scream 
Comes as no surprise 
It must be hard to see 
Behind my eyes 
I say my love is true 
It's full of lies 
Passion's flame burns 
For the last time tonight 
So spread your angel wings 
We can fly
