On a dark and foggy night the moon hangs high in the sky
Quiet streets leave footstep echoing on in my mind
Something inside of me rages out for release in my soul
Again the full moon tolls

Try to run, try to hide
From the light of the moon
And its curse it holds on me
With its mark I now bear
Since the day of my birth
It changes me - you don't want to see

Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
A dagger of silver plunged in my heart 'tis my solemn release
Seems such a small price to pay

I feel a change begin of which I have no control
That curse full moonlight tearing into my soul
Why was I born with a mark - transforms me into a beast
I suddenly need to feast

Look away, turn and run as fast as you can
Yours might be the next life gone

Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
Shade of red in my eye, there's no turning back
And now like a beast I attack
Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
A dagger of silver plunged in my heart 'tis my solemn release -
Seems such a small price to pay

You hold the key to releasing this spell
Silver dagger in hand you strike the bell
With a shattering scream I bid you farewell

Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
As this mark fades away along with my life
I can't help feeling free again
Small price to pay for release of my soul -
Small price indeed
Now released from this bond that vexed mine so
Though I am gone, I am whole
Small price to pay
Mark my words, I'll live on, wild and free
Now that the beast is unchained from me
