Through empty words and promises the madman speaks
His lies go forth as law unto those who believe
Under dark commands he leads the way to a brighter day
Yet that day will never come, will never come, will never come
His day will come

Say the word and I will follow
Speak the truth I will believe
Cast not your shadow on my eyes
Open minds are lead astray
With the hope for a brighter day
Cast not your shadow on my heart
A promise made a promise kept
Remove the lie there's nothing left
Cast not your shadow of a promise

Generals bow before him while the people damn his name
Madman, God or just a fool
Using words of victory, justice and unity
To him these are lies - such an unfortunate surprise

With just one word a nation is moved and justifies his power
The tyrant laughs for in his mind he is supreme
Yet as the sun sets lowly in my heart a nation is broken
And the youth feel the pain, the youth feel the pain
The youth will rise against

Say the word and I will follow
Speak the truth I will believe
Cast not your shadow on my eyes
Open minds are lead astray
With the hope for a brighter day
Cast not your shadow on my heart
A promise made a promise kept
Remove the lie there's nothing left
Cast not your shadow of a promise

Too late for words to turn back the hands of time
Yet deeds take place of sorrow and change its course in line
Dressed in robes of honor, blindly gaining our trust
Soon his robes will be stained with tyranny, with tyranny
With tyranny and blood

Say the word and I will follow
Speak the truth I will believe
Cast not your shadow on my eyes
Open minds are lead astray
With the hope for a brighter day
Cast not your shadow on my heart
A promise made a promise kept
Remove the lie there's nothing left
Cast not your shadow of a promise
Say the word and I will follow
Speak the truth I will believe
Cast not your shadow of a promise
