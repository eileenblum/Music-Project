There are powers in this world
People seem to be in control of it all
Spreading madness like disease
Damping the flames of freedom's call
You can't stop what's inevitable
A thirst for power is a deadly game
Crushing whatever gets in their way
They're using you they're using me

Contracts and principles
All play a part in the winner's game
Roll the dice with your life it comes so cheap
Oh but we have minds to change the rules
Puppet masters in houses of gold
Plan our future for their own gain
Yeah but I'm not gonna play that way
Save your money for another man - not me

Winner, loser
There's no winners in this game of greed
Winner, loser
Lust for power is a demon seed
Winner, loser
The more they win, the more you lose

Reach down inside of yourselves
You'll mind there's a better man deep inside
Waiting to be set free
Let it out, yeah let it fly
There's no limit to the mind
Take hold of this wave of magic
There's hope for a brighter day
Don't let anyone stand in your way

Winner, loser
There's no winners in this game of greed
Winner, loser
Lust for power is the demon seed
Winner, loser
The more they win, the more you lose
Winner, loser

Look in his eyes, you'll see a stranger there
One shake from his hand will lead you to despair
He's the taker, "life breaker" is his middle name
So don't play his game

Winner, loser
There's no winners in this game of greed
Winner, loser
Lust for power is a demon seed
Winner, loser
The more they win, the more you lose
Winner, loser
Winner, loser
There's no winners in this game of greed
Winner, loser
Lust for power is the demon seed
