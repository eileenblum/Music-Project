As the sun sets low in an eastern sky
As the wall's chipped away from the other side
Homeless are clothed and the hungry fed
As the humble word freedom is boldly said

With our eyes fixed to the stars
There is no stopping us now
Face to face, eye to eye
Hand in hand we touch the sky tonight

Give me your tired and your huddled masses
Hungry souls needing to breathe free
Chasing a new world at the end of a rainbow
Yes you can have it all, just talk to me

With our eyes fixed to the stars
There is no stopping us now
Face to face, eye to eye
Hand in hand we touch the sky
Release those bonds let's break those chains
Let your heart fly free again
Face to face, eye to eye
Hand in hand we touch the sky
Release those bonds let's break those chains
Let your hearts fly free again

Across the world new path are beaten
Step by step new ideas unfold
People standing true for that they believe in
A new song is sung, a new bell is tolled

With our eyes fixed to the stars
There is no stopping us now
Face to face, eye to eye
Hand in hand we touch the sky
Release those bonds let's break those chains
Let your hearts fly free again
Face to face, eye to eye
Hand in hand we touch the sky
Release those bonds let's break those chains
Let your hearts fly free again
Face to face and eye to eye
Hand in hand we can all touch the sky
