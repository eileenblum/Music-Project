Red sky rage their angry cry upon the battle plains
Soldiers march into history for a cause unexplained
Yet in every heart, in every man, there is a need to win
When one dabbles in war games, who's to say what is sin

Fields of valor and victory
White crosses that bear no name
Each one gave their life to history
Fields of valor and victory
A young boy in an old man's game
Each one gave their life for a nameless cross

Skies bleed pain upon us all a the night comes falling down
Cries of victory cannot be heard when you're six feet underground
Yet feel they understand the paths that they have made
Our children can now run free - price of liberty is paid

Turn back the hands of time so I may ask their names
And place each name upon a stone, to never fade away
