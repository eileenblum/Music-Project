Soldiers of fortune
Seeking revenge on the mishaps in life
Beating the odds as the dice roll
The night is their playground
Feeding desires by tempting their souls
As the color of green fades to grey

Place your bets on life's wheel
Give it a spin
Don't play the fool
Don't play the fool
Fool on the run

Soldiers of passion
Searching to satisfy more than the mind
One night of pleasure that turns into pain
Hearts are too fragile
And easily scarred like diamonds on glass
When love is a gamble someone has to pay

Place your bets on life's wheel
Give it a spin
Don't play the fool
Don't play the fool
Fool on the run
Place your bets on life's wheel
Give it a spin
Don't play the fool
Don't play the fool
Fool on the run

Living your life in half the time
Always on the edge
You're moving faster than the rest
Does it get you anywhere
Oh my child with a heart of gold
What's that inside you
Has the world turned you cold
Do you see the magic
I see you felt the pain
You're running nowhere
But into the fire again
Reach out and take life
Before it slips away
It's that devil inside you
Slowly making you pay for your dreams
You look like a fool on the run
What are you running for
You fool

Soldiers of liberty
You know it all
When will you learn
Freedom is only a conflict away
This world you desire
Its magic is there
Open your eyes
Don't confuse your dreams
With what is real, no

Place your bets on life's wheel
Give it a spin
Don't play the fool
Don't play the fool
Fool on the run
It's time you place your bets on life's wheel
Give it a spin
Don't play the fool
Don't play the fool
Fool on the run
