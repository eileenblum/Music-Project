On the edge of a silent scream
Somewhere in your thoughts
(I play my game)
A jester in the court of pleasure
Where love is pain
I laugh as you writhe controlled
You're the tiger I'm the chain
Diving deep in the pool of ecstasy
Swim with me once again

Giving more as you receive
Till your cup runneth over
Speak the word and you'll never leave me

Heartbeats race with ravenous fury
As the tide pulls me in
(You pull me in)
Lost in a whirlpool of fantasy
Close your eyes and the world starts to spin
Entwined together moving as one
A motion that is easily swayed
With a whimper and a shattering scream
Another wound bleeds from my blade

Giving more as you receive
Till your cup runneth over
Speak the word and you'll never leave me

Lord of desire
Start the fire and dance in its flame
Lord of desire
Taste of blood on my tongue as I bled once again
To partake of you
Oh, sweet venom that burns on my tongue
Kneel before the lord of desire
All too innocent you fall...
In my spell of desire

On the edge of a silent scream
Somewhere in your thoughts
(I play my game)
A jester in the court of pleasure
Where love is pain
I laugh as you writhe controlled
You're the tiger I'm the chain
Diving deep in the pool of ecstasy
Swim with me once again

Giving more as you receive
Till your cup runneth over
Speak the word and you'll never leave

Lord of desire
Start the fire and dance in its flame
Lord of desire
Taste of blood on my tongue as I bled once again
To partake of you
Oh, sweet venom that burns on my tongue
Kneel before the lord of desire
All too innocent you fall...
Lord of desire
Start the fire and dance in its flame
Lord of desire
Taste of blood on my tongue as I bled once again
Lord of desire
Start the fire and dance in its flame
Lord of desire
Taste of blood on my tongue as I bled once again
