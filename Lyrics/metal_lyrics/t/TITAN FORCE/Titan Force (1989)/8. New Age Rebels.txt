As the lightning cracked the storm began
And it spread like fire across the land
Many songs of freedom for all to hear
One voice aflame to every open ear

Reach for the stars, reach for it all
The power is in our hands
Shouting out with victory
Voices echo through the land

Rebels of a new age
Together we are one
Pounding out the rhythms
Of a different song

Come one, come all to the piper's tune
There's a new world ahead and it's coming soon
Bringing a change as the youth grows strong
Breaking the silence of a deaf world so wrong

Reach for the stars, reach for it all
The power is in our hands
Shouting out with victory
Voices echo through the land

Rebels of a new age
Together we are one
Pounding out the rhythms
Of a different song
Rebels of a new age
Fighting for a cause
The future is in our hands
This world is ours

Now with minds of metal
And hearts as true as steel
We raise our voices to the sky
New age rebels
Charismatic in our ways
We stand as one
And all else must stand aside

Coming together millions strong
Right here in this place where nothing feels wrong
All for one and one for all
You can joint the ranks if you heed the call

Reach for the stars, reach for it all
The power is in our hands
Shouting out with victory
Voices echo through the land

Rebels of a new age
Together we are one
Pounding out the rhythms
Of a different song
Rebels of a new age
Fighting for a cause
The future is in our hands
This world is ours

Gathered together as one we forge a union
Getting stronger, stronger than steel
Holding steadfast in our ways with a taste for victory
We're the founders of a new evolution
