I am the eyes of night time
When you gaze into the darkness, I'll be there
Go ahead and place your heart in my hand
Take what I need and leave you in despair

Though you turn your eyes
You can't look away
You'll be chained to love
Just like a slave

I'm the master
Master of disguise
Painting a beautiful picture full of lies

Come feel the flames of desire
Taking you down I get my way tonight
I see some things are hard to swallow
But a scratch and a scream comes as no surprise

Though you turn your eyes
You can't look away
You'll be chained to love
Just like a slave

I'm the master
Master of disguise
Painting a beautiful picture full of lies
I'm the master
Master of disguise
Painting a beautiful picture full of lies
I'm the master
Master of disguise
I can steal your heart, look into my eyes
I'm the master
Yes, the master of disguise
Flowly speak of love, I speak of lies
The master of disguise

It must be hard to see behind my eyes
I say my love is true, it's full of lies
Passion's flame burns for the last time tonight
So spread your angel wings, we can fly

Though you turn your eyes
You can't look away
You'll be chained to love
Just like a slave

I'm the master of disguise
Painting a beautiful picture full of lies
I'm the master of disguise
Painting a beautiful picture full of lies
I'm the master of disguise
I can steal your heart, look into my eyes
I'm the master of disguise
Master of disguise
I'm the master
Yes, the master of disguise
Flowly speak of love, I speak of lies
The master of disguise
