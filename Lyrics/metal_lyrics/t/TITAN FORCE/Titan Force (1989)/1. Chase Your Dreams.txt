Somewhere in your mind
Somewhere deep down inside of yourself
There is a rage for something better
(Something new)
All of your dreams
All of your anticipations
They cause a drive to make us stronger
(Keep it alive)

Chase your thoughts
Chase your dreams
Into the night
Chase your thoughts
Chase your dreams
Keep it alive

Our time is now
Take hold of the lighting, ride to the stars
Break free of the shell that has you imprisoned
(Escape to night)
Come taste with me
All of the fruits that life has in store
Someday we all will learn to give our love once more

Fight for your heart
Before it's over
Never give in
Chase your dreams

You got to
Fight for your heart
Before it's over
Never give in
Chase your dreams
Come on and chase your dreams

Well, can't you see
It's just outside of your grasp
You've got to reach out with both hands
And grab that tiger on the tail

Somewhere in your mind
Somewhere deep down inside of yourself
There is a rage for something better
(Something new)
All of your dreams
All of your anticipations
They cause a drive to make us stronger
(Keep it alive)

Fight for your heart
Before it's over
Never give in
Chase your dreams

You got to
Fight for your heart
Before it's over
Never give in
Chase your dreams

Fight for your heart
Fight for your soul
Never give in
Fight for your heart
Fight for your soul
Never give in
Fight for your heart
Fight for your soul
Never give in
Chase your dreams
