Tonight we'll be flying
That burning desire
To loose all control tonight
That feeling of rage
Let it take you away
Let loose that tiger from its cage

Nearing the countdown
Living on the edge
Release your desire to fly
On wings of rage

Oh children of sin
I'll let you all in
On a secret that we all know
There is a power
Somewhere deep inside
When find it
Let it go

Nearing the countdown
Living on the edge
Release your desire to fly
Riding the lightning
Straight to the top
We'll fly on wings of rage
Can't stop this fire
It's burning way too hot
We'll fly on wings of rage
Fly high

Come on and join with the rest
Put your mind to the test
Harness that electric spark
Take on the lead
Get from life what you need
Strive on to reach your mark

Nearing the countdown
Living on the edge
Release your desire to fly
Riding the lightning
Straight to the top
We'll fly on wings of rage
Can't stop this fire
It's burning way too hot
We'll fly on wings of rage
Riding the lightning
Straight to the top
We'll fly on wings of rage
Can't stop this fire
It's burning way too hot
We'll fly on wings of...
Wings of rage
