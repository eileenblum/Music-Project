Silence explodes from our turbine roars
As we take into the air with the vengeance in our souls
Higher and higher and higher we climb
Piercing a hole through the enemy lines
Flying undetected well as if they didn't know
Bomb bays open destroying everything below
Laughing at death as weapons spit their flames
Am I in hell? Or am insane

In a blaze of glory we rule the night
Revenge is ours ,victory is in sight
In a blaze of glory the enemy falls
The time is now, you must decide
In a blaze of glory we rule the night
Revenge is ours ,victory is in sight
In a blaze of glory the enemy falls
The time is now, you must decide
Go down in flames or go up in a blaze of glory

Another victim burns on his way to history
I don't blink an eye it was either him or me
Just another notch in the nose of Jezebel
She's shown me the heavens and I have shown her hell
Scramble in formation for another swift attack
Once you're in the pocket where there's no way back
Speed and concentration caught within my grip
Pulling on the trigger as the sweat runs from my lip

In a blaze of glory we rule the night
Revenge is ours, victory is in sight
In a blaze of glory the enemy falls
The time is now, you must decide
In a blaze of glory we rule the night
Revenge is ours, victory is in sight
In a blaze of glory the enemy falls
The time is now, you must decide
Go down in flames or go up in a blaze of glory

There's one more left yes we're all alone
Though riddled with bullets I must push on
He moves into position, hot on my tail
Lining up the spot to send me to hell
I've still one more trick hidden up my sleeve
My cockpit revolves and bullets leave
Flames of disgrace are what I see
As I blaze into the sun on wings of victory

In a blaze of glory we rule the night
Revenge is ours, victory is in sight
In a blaze of glory the enemy falls
The time is now, you must decide
In a blaze of glory we rule the night
Revenge is ours, victory is in sight
In a blaze of glory the enemy falls
The time is now, you must decide
Go down in flames or go up in a blaze of glory
