The sky obscure
The people self concealed
Every world destroyed
And angels running for help

By my lord, by my lord
Demon lord, demon lord

The moon is bleeding
The sea obscure
A wood is an altar
The altar for sacrifice

By my lord, by my lord
Demon lord, demon lord

Demon...!!!
My lord...!!!

Dark bird flying
In the dark skies
Looking for the sign
Birth of the night

By my lord, by my lord
Demon lord, demon lord

Demon...!!!
My lord...!!!

He's the power
The power of the night
Look for him
And kneel down

By my lord, by my lord
Demon lord, demon lord
