The magician, his breast bare
Stands before an altar on which
Are his burnings
In the sign of the enterer he
Reaches west across the altar!!!

Hail Ra, that goes in they back
Into the caverns of dark
He gives the sign of silence
And take the bell and fire in his hands

East of the altar see me stand
With light and magic in hands!!!

I strike the bell, I light the flame,
I utter the mysterious name of phoenix!!!
