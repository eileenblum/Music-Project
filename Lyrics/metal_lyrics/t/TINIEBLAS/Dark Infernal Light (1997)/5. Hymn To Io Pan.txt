I love the night, the power of the night
Oh Io Pan, oh Io Pan, my Io Pan

Come careening out of the night of
Pan!!!
Io Pan!!!

Cover over the sea
From Sicily and from Arcady!!!
Come the guards of the protection
Tell me, why

Why the power of the darkside is mighty?
Because the dark side is never a joke
And this is true!!!
Come with Artemis, Silken Sho,
And was thy white thigh,
Beautiful God!!!

In the moon of the woods
On the marble mount, the
Dimpled dawn of the amber
Fount the soul that
Startles in eyes of blue to
Watch they wantonness
Weening through the tangled grove
The gnarled bole of the
Living tree that is spirit and soul

Oh Io Pan, oh Io Pan
Devil or God, tell me!!!

Come with trumpets sounding
Shrill, over the hill
Oh Io Pan!!!

In the moon of the woods
On the marble mount, the
Dimpled dawn of the amber fount

Oh Io Pan, oh Io Pan
Cover over the sea
Comes the guards of the
Protections, tell me!!!
