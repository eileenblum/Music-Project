I am the heart
The black snake entwined around
Invisible in the core of the mind,
Oh my black snake

It is now the hours of the
Houled and unholy ineffable
Flower, oh black my snake, into brilliance
Of bloom on the corpse Osiris of
Loat in the tomb
Thou are give tunile,
To the terror

All night I dance with the snake!!!
Oh my darling, my serpent!!!
That twinest around this heart
I am the heart, art thou the serpent
Close around me, so that
No light, no bliss may penetrate!!!

I invoke the force of the snake
Crush out the blood of me

The white doctrine grill that
Languishes in the moonlight then let
The end awake!!!
The lord of glory has come
The power of the darkness is
Here now!!!
