Enslaver
We call you
Disturb you
Impudent
We deny you
We mock you
We invoke you
To hear me
Twisted rhymes
Metaphors of lunacy
Virus paradox
To suffer our knowledge

You impotent,
Bastard
Your aged reign
Collapses

In mortal fury
We desecrate
Your holy flesh
Mocking impotence

Hell, the dark land
Abyss, the wonder land
Havohej, fallen emperor

God of three heads cursed in all tongues

We mock you
Realm on earth
Corrupted and defiled
We turn the sun to black
The earth burns red to grey
All life fall before our hate
Enter the void unreal
