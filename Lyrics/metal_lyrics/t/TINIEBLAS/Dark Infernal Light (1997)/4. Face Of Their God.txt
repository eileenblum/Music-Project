From chaos we rise in unholy hatred
To crush the warm living flesh of angels!!!
We storm the walls of heaven and
Eviscerated the lord of the throne
Usurping forever the reign of the enslaver,
And rejecting the morality of the weak

On earth the head cowers knowing
That it must now stand for itself
Our power and strength
Is destruction, all order shall fall
To our eternal night of mayhem
When we will return the triumph of
Ancient violence, our hatred the will of
The Christian and they cower knowing
That we came to punish them with pain and
To desecrate the face of their God with
Virgin menstrual blood and black shit
