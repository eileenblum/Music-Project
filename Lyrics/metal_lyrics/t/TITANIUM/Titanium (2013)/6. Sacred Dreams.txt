Restoring pictures in my mind that I have never left behind.
So many dreams up in the air I will never take away.
If only I could fly to reach again heavens of my life.
On broken wings it seems so hard to fly high.

Never stay!!
I will be fighting till the end to live again.
Cause I'm still longing to feel sunshine on my face
and open all the gates closed forever.

Year after year I see the fire in your eyes.
Wake up and open up your mind to realize.

Sacred dreams are everywhere I will never take away.
I'll be waiting here in secret once again.
Sacred dreams are everywhere I will never take away.
I'll be waiting here in secret once again.

Prepare your mind for what's behind
to finally reach the distant shore.
carried away by dream again I will always lust for more!!

If only I could fly to reach the distant sky.
Restoring in my mind The pictures of my life.

Never stay!!
I will be fighting till the end to live again.
cause I'm still longing to feel sunshine on my face
and open all gates closed forever.

Year after year I see the fire in your eyes.
Wake up and open up your mind to realize.

Sacred dreams are everywhere I will never take away.
I'll be waiting here in secret once again.
Sacred dreams are everywhere I will never take away.
I'll be waiting here in secret once again.

Winter's gone I feel reborn and I don't waste another breath
I'm still the same.

[Solo: J.Bona]

Take away the sorrow heading for tomorrow
I will glorify my name!

[Solo: K.Mania]

Never stay!!
I will be fighting till the end to live again.
Cause I'm still longing to feel sunshine on my face
and open all the gates closed forever.

Year after year I see the fire in your eyes.
Wake up and open up your mind to realize.

Sacred dreams are everywhere I will never take away.
I'll be waiting here in secret once again.
Sacred dreams are everywhere I will never take away.
I'll be waiting here in secret once again.
