You'll never see the light hiding in the night.
You know it's all illusion of your twisted mind.
I will possess you inflicting the disease.
When I catch you helpless I will start to feast.

You can't resist my spells whe you're blind.
You will demse I sense your fear the end is near!
Cause in the dark there's no chance to survive.
You can't go beyond dogmatic mind.

Dogmatic mind! Confused all time.
Get a life you're the only to decide.
Out of the dark where nothing gets you down.
Get a life, you're the only to decide.

I'll always find the way to lead you astray.
Implanting mental illness you'll never be the same.
I could exploit you from bottom to the end,
hidden in disguise you'll even not exclaim.

You can't resist my spells when you're blind.
You will demise I sense your fear the end is near!
Cause in the dark there's no chance to survive.
You can't go beyond dogmatic mind.

Dogmatic mind! Confused all the time.
Get a life, you're the only to decide.
Out of the dark where nothing gets you down.
Get a life, you're the only to decide.

[Solo: K.Mania / K.Mania / J.Bona]

They steal your life ...In every moment that
you turn around it is too late.
They have no shame... to practice airs and graces
and control your fate.

It's in your mind the key to break the chains
and free you from despair.
You're cold inside asleep yet not awaken.
It's only the beginning that you've always need.

Dogmatic mind! Confused all the time.
Get a life, you're the only to decide.
Out of the dark where nothing gets you down.
Get a life, you're the only to decide.
