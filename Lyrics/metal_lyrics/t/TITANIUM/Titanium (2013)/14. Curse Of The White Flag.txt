Curse of the white flag Primoz stays at home.
We won't let him surrender Don't let him die alone.

Let me tell you a story of a friend of mine.
He dominates our hearts, our gold, our minds.
Year was 1992 on the polish ground.
Beginning of the metal sound.

We were rocking really hard under flying flag!
But the color was the curse, today we know that fact.
This is how we lost a friend possessed by flag,
And we never ever got him back...

Fly the flag for metal united for your life.
Remember that the colors can take your man alive.

Curse of the white flag Primoz stays at home.
We won't let him surrender He'll not die alone.
Curse of the white flag Primoz stays at home.
We won't let him surrender Don't let him die alone.

Years was 1995 we started band that rocks fine.
We got another flag and the curse was back.
We said:"Primoz shred guitar, blow away our thoughts"
Play he tribute to the fuckin' gods!

We were set he was in, even flag was made.
Primoz chilling in the bath thinking rockin' mad.
But the color wasn't right, curse hit him in a nose.
Gas pipe put him in the hos.

Fly the flag for metal united riffs of still.
Remember that the colors can stand against your will.

Curse of the white flag Primoz stays at home.
We won't let him surrender He'll not die alone.
Curse of the white flag Primoz stays at home.
We won't let him surrender Don't let him die alone.

We'll never surrender fight for the flag (?)
We will be defenders, we will die (?)
Another (?) going with us to dream together
Today your way (?)
We will fight (?) the end of time.

It's the end of a story of a friend of mine,
whose life was cursed by the flag not black.
I know you think it's just a stupid act
but It's only japan bonus track, Hey!
I know you won't believe that the story's true.
Come to Ostrow and you'll see there's nothing new.
Color doesn't matter without any doubt,
Primoz never ever will get out!

Fly the flag for metal united for your life.
Remember that the colors can take your man alive.

Curse of the white flag Primoz stays at home.
We won't let him surrender
He'll not die alone.
Curse of the white flag Primoz stays at home.
We won't let him surrender
Don't let him die alone.
