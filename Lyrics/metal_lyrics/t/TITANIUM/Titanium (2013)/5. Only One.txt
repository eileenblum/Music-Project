Walking down the street when I first saw you.
Another day beside you dreams came true!
But we can't go on and you have to know.
I can't afford the price you are worth.

Walking down the street when I saw you again.
It always makes me crazy when I whisper your name!
We can still unite.
I'm lost again and I'm completly far away
and I can feel the pain.

I wake up sweaty in the heat of the night.
Dreams to posses you are still deep inside.
I cannot breath and I cannot stay.
I have to wake up it's the only way.

My only one you can be mine.
I'll keep on fighting till the end of my time.
In my dreams I hold you close to me,
I don't want to wake up to stop the dream.

Your shining silver strings are everything to me.
Your slim and glowing body gives me creeps!
No more I can stand lack of your stainless neck.
I will be there around you made me back.

I wake up sweaty in the heat of the night.
Dreams to posses you are still deep inside.
I cannot breath and I cannot stay.
I have to wake up it's the only way.

My only one you can be mine.
I'll keep on fighting till the end of my time,
In my dreams I hold you close to me,
I don't want to wake up to stop the dream.
