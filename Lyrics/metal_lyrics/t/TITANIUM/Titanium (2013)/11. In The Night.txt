[Solo: K.Mania]

In the Night when light is out.
I can sense your lips so close to mine.
When the night falls down and makes us blind
we unite our souls in endless time.

Another day, another lonely morning.
Another long day without you.
I miss you so, and it sounds strange for me.
It gets me down I can't get through.

I was discarded by my fate and locked behind the gate.
I lost myself in memories of the past life.
I sweared to never be the same but I can feel the change.
How could I face and win this last strife.

It came with setting sun diving in horizon.
I close my eyes and felt your breath.
The moment we are here in never-ending dream,
until we're parted by the death.

In the Night, when light is out
I can sense your lips so close to mine.
When the night falls down and makes us blind
we unite our souls in endless time.

And I will dream no more!
All things I've seen before
will lead us to the promised land.
And I'm so scared to sleep to enter different dream.
What's here is clear and real.
The future of us I've foreseen In the night.

When the lights are out and the night becomes my bride.
In the shade where two worlds unite.
I can feel no fear when you seems so near.
In the night when I start just for life.

[Solo: J.Bona]

Now I can feel like touch the sky
Enchanted by the night I paint with joy and sorrow.
The hope is burning in my eyes.
I leave it all behind rejoicing in tomorrow.

When the world is passing by
we're carried by the wind of hope.
We can fly higher
No time to say goodbye as I did realize
the meaning of desire.

[Solo: Gunsen]

In the Night when light is out.
I can sense your lips so close to mine.
When the night falls down and makes us blind
we unite our souls in endless time.
