[Solo: K.Mania]

I could leave this world forever
without any words to say.
But I cannot still forget you
you're on my mind every single day.

I could leave this world forever
but it's not my time not yet.
And I know it wasn't fine but
I still remember every taste of your soul.

Until I fade away I'll be tasting every moment
that you give me now when I see the light of day
that still surrounds me.

Forever mine, the only one!
I'll never leave you, you will still shine.
Forever mine, the only one!
I'll wait for tomorrow I'm waiting all night.

I could live this world forever.
I don't wanna you to cry.
Could I know it wasn't fine, no...
Too many things were between us.

I could leave this world forever.
Never mind the past behind.
And maybe there is someone
who gave you love that I couldn't do.

Forever mine, the only one!
I'll never leave you, you will still shine.
Forever mine, the only one!
I'll wait for tomorrow I'm waiting all night.

[Solo: K.Mania]

In the days when I did meet you and
I didn't realize It would go that far.
You are beyond this world
beyond everything I've ever dreamed of...
I never really cared what you say, no!

[Solo: K.Mania]

Until I fade away I'll be tasting every moment
that you give me now when I see the light of day
that still surrounds me.

Forever mine, the only one!
I'll never leave you, you will still shine.
Forever mine, the only one!
I'll wait for tomorrow I'm waiting all night.
