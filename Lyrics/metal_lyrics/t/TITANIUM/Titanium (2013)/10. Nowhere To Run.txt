Coming to your town again!
I believe you still remember my name.
In my lifetime I have seen it all before
I was the witness of your fall
and you made me to perceive what is to believe!

Coming to your town again!
Like an ever flowing stream,
You could think that I'm insane.

Every night and day
when I long for something else,
misleading voices in my head
draw me far away from home,
where finally I will roam.

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide!
You always guide my life.
No place to live nowhere to leave!
Take me far away i'll leave it all behind.

Coming to your town again!
Don't you keep in mind that night when I ran away.

After all those years
you will never be the same.
We are the part of unfair game.
we are lost you can't deny.
Crawling in the night
Always by your side.

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide!
You always guide my life.
No place to live nowhere to leave!
Take me far away I'll leave it all behind.

Another year has passed away.
I've learned a lot about myself.
I will return I have to brak away,
all my decisons lead me to astray.
Every morning I wake up I realize the same.

In my lifetime I have seen it all before.
I was the witness of your fall
and you made me to perceive what is to believe!
And after all those years
you will never be the same,
We are the part of unfair game!
we are lost you can't deny.
Crawling in the night!
Always by your side!

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide!
you always guide my life.
No place to live nowhere to leave!
Take me far away I'll leave it all behind.
