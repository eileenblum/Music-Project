Far beyond the skies
where nemesis has come.
I can't believe all disappeared
and never will reborn.

Insinuation grows.
How could they change the course?
With anger on my chapped face!
Losing faith without remorse.

Oh, please take me out of there
where I'd surely go insane.
There is nothing more to fulfill my life again.
Now it's time to sail away.

When the sun appears I try to understand
when another world became my holy land.
Thrown away by blindness of my kind.
Salvaged by my own unconscious mind.

I'm drifting out with fear,
How all this can be real.
Split second passed
and I'm inside the cab in different place.

Life's changing like a breeze,
but I will seek another day to seize.
I will commence and I will get another chance!

Many races come and go.
But it's not my puppet show!
Through the ages I endure the pantomime.
The world is mine and I will stand the test of time.

When the sun appears I try to understand
when another world became my holy land.
Thrown away by blindness of my kind
salvaged by my own unconscious mind!

[Solo: K.Mania]

Predicting!! Preserving!!
I'm here to save you and protect the earth
since the dawn of the mankind.

In Tardis escaping
when Galifrey's explosion rejected me away.
Lost in unknown dimensions.
And I was born eleventh time to live another life.

When the sun appears I try to understand
when another world became my holy land.
Thrown away by blindness of my kind.
Salvaged by my own unconscious mind.

When the sun appears I try to understand
when another world became my holy land.

[Choir:]
And when the sun appears,
and when the daylight's gone
and in another world,
another chance will come.
