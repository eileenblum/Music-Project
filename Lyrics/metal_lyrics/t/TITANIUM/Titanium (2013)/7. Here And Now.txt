Don't ever tell me "Shut your mouth!"
or I will break your nose,
and you will never recognize your face anymore.

This time I win It's fuckin' truth.
Don't tell me you are brave,
when you are lurking in the dark to fade away.

Come here and show me what you've learned
what you have done just make my day.
Open your mind for what's behind
or you will never realize the truth of me and you.

Every day here and now,
you've been searching for the way to bring me down.
Different time, different place
I'll be waiting for the time to kick your ass.

I'm not fuckin' toy to play!
you used to do that every day.
Can you see the difference between love and pain?

You are confused when I don't stay
but tell me what you think when I go away again and again.

Come here and show me what you've learned
what you have done just make my day.
Open your mind for what's behind
or you will never realize the truth of me and you.

Every day here and now.
you've beem searching for the way to bring me down.
Different time, different place
I'll be waiting for the time to kick your ass.

I saw it all before and I'm sure to not even try
cause I'm waiting my life for the reason.
If you make me feel sorry I don't care about your story
I have the world for my own.

I'm not a fuckin' toy to play!
You used to do that every day.
Can you see the difference between love and pain?

You are confused when I don't stay
but tell me what you think when I go away again and again.

Come here and show me what you've learned
what you have done just to make my day.
Open your mind for what's behind
or you will never realize the truth of me and you.

Every day here and now,
you've been searching for the way to bring me down.
Different time, different place
I'll be waiting for the time to kick your ass.
