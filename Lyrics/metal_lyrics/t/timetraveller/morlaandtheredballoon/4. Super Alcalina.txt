[feat. Tyler Carter]This is it, my station, when you know you walk ten miles makes you wise. Now you'll have to walk ten miles just to get back out. And I could lie, cheat, and steal, but that wouldn't get me anywhere. No it never got me anywhere.

Oh, don't you wake the monster. Oh, you don't have to do this alone so don't, don't you wake the monster. You're gonna have to dig your way out of this old day.

Look inside, this child is broken. Reach inside, your hands come out with nothing. Look inside, this child is broken. Reach inside, your hands come out with nothing and no one knows.

Oh, don't you wake the monster. Oh, you don't have to do this alone so don't, don't you wake the monster. You're gonna have to dig your way out of this old day.

I'm looking for a moment to blow. Everybody's looking for a moment to blow. Dollars on dollars, making it snow. But after the show they got nowhere to go (I'm so caught up), they go back to the same nightmares they call home (caught up in all my fear).

So call it home (but at least I'm not alone), wish you would disappear. I'm so caught up, caught up in all my fear. Don't wake the monster up.

Oh, don't you wake the monster (wish you would disappear). Oh, you don't have to do this alone so don't (I'm so caught up), don't you wake the monster (caught up in all my fear). You're gonna have to dig your way out of this old day.

You thought I knew me, but I was so wrong. Now we're so wrong.
