["Shed" B-Side]I try to recall what it feels like 
To feel missed when I'm away 
It makes me feel the same 
When you're not listening 
You were begging me to stay 
I just can't think about how 
Better we could be alone 
All alone 

I try to forget what it feels like 
To not want to leave again 
It's not worth it to feel worthless 
I said it's all in my head 
All in my head
