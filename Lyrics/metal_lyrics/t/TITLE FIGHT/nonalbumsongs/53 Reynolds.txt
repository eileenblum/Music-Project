As I sit here without you
I wonder what I should do to get you in my life
then I realized, my time is coming up
so I'll just sit here and wait for my turn

I could be next
if you think so.

Send shivers down my spine
just knowing that I'm in line,
just to be with you.
Send shivers down my spine
just knowing that I'm in line
just to be with you.

No apologies
I don't want to have to hear what you have to say to me
you can talk all you want
cause I'm not listening.

I could be next
if you think so.

Send shivers down my spine
just knowing that I'm in line
just to be with you.
Send shivers down my spine
just knowing that I'm in line
just to be with you.

Send shivers down my spine
just knowing that I'm in line
just to be with you.
Send shivers down my spine
just knowing that I'm in line
just to be with you.
