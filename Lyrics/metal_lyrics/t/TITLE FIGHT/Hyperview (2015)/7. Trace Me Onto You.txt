Trace me onto you
Criminal
Had my blood removed
Cold world

Withdrew vividly
You move so smooth
Mumbling jealously
"I hate you"

Trace me onto you
Criminal
Had my blood removed
Cold world

Too high-fidelity
Shy disapprove
Squint from the bottom of
hidden flumes

(I don't want to see things differently
It's what I taught myself to believe
Hypernight belongs to me
I'll never sleep quietly

Losing light
Hypernight)
