Not saying youâre here
Never alone, yeah, always near
Do you regret being used?
Are you used to it yet?

Donât throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
And I say "Donât throw me away
I want to be your toy forever"

Alone in my room
Straight from the ones you knew
Itâs hard to relate
When I canât screw my head on straight

Donât throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
And I say "Donât throw me away
I want to be your toy forever"

Donât throw me away
I want to be your toy forever
And I say "Donât throw me away
I want to be your toy forever"
