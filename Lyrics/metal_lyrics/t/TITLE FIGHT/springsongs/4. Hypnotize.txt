Sink into the floor, what can I say?
You haven't heard before

Is it too much to cope again?
I just wanted to know
I just wanted.

Day dream all day
Stand and wait
Hallucinate

Is it too much to cope again?
I just wanted to know
Feel the drill through my head.

Stay inside
I feel fine
Ignore the signs.
