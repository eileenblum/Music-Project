Another floor
A different ceiling than the night before
Where am I while you're back home
Life goes on and on and on and on

This strange routine sometimes weighs down on me
But I wouldn't trade it
Not for anything
Maybe there's nothing
Only this moment

As cars pass by
Live fast or slow or stay alive
Where am I while you're back home
Time goes on and on and on and on

This strange routine sometimes weighs down on me
But I wouldn't trade it
Not for anything
Maybe there's nothing
Only this moment
