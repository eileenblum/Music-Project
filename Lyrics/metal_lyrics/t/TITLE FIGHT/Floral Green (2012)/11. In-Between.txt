Constantly in-between home and where I'll be.
Light separates the space.
I feel the cold against my face.

I know I'll be there soon.
Don't worry, I saw it too.

Always passing through.
Always torn in two.
Staring straight through the night,
while your red eyes said enough.

I know I'll be there soon
Don't worry, I saw it too

Long way away always.

Constantly in-between home and where I'll be.
Light separates the space.
I feel the cold against my face.
