I made promises that I canât keep.
I fell asleep.
I was the one who locked the door.
I lost the key.
You told me lies straight to my face,
but I guess thatâs fate.
I said, âeverything is fine with me.â
I lied through my teeth.
Iâve lost all of my self respect.
Iâm such a wreck
Iâm running out of air to breathe.
I think itâs time for me to leave my friends all behind.
Watch me hurt, or are you blind?
I think itâs sad youâll never know.
My true feelings will never show.

I made promises that I canât keep.
I fell asleep.
I was the one who locked the door.
I lost the key.
You told me lies straight to my face,
but I guess thatâs fate.

Iâll be you and youâll be me
Iâll be you and youâll be me
My secret society
