First time in a while that everything is fine.
Iâd lie to you; Iâve been lying to myself all the time.
And your voice in the back of my head-
wishing things could be quiet.
And your voice, murdering the silence-
consistent like a ritual.

Iâd stop and stare imagining that youâd be there.
Iâd spend my days wasting my time constantly.

And your voice in the back of my head-
wishing things could be quiet.
And your voice, murdering the silence-
consistent like a ritual
