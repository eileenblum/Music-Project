Youâre calloused, but you donât even know
Iâm picking at my scabs.
Iâll let all the bruises show.

Iâll never forget what all these feelings meant.
Flying home for a funeral was my last regret.

I hear a telephone three thousand miles from home.
Do you really care?
Your heart is just a stone.

Iâll never forget what all these feelings meant.
Flying home for a funeral was my last regret.
