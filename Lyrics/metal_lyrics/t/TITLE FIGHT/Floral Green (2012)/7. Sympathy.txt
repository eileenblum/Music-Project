Can I tell you everything?
All I ever wanted was to be interesting.
You said you donât mind.
Lie to me one more time.
Iâm boring, no fun at all.
I put my head right through the wall.
I try to make myself feel.
No luck this time.
Try again next year.
Iâve led myself to believe the world has turned its back to me.
Howâs that for comforting?
I just want to be interesting.
Iâm sorry if you donât see me as much as you deem necessary.
You say you care for your friends.
Did you lie or just pretend?
I never wanted sympathy, just wanted to be something.

Iâve led myself to believe the world has turned its back to me.
Howâs that for comforting?
I just want to be interesting.
