But did you know?
I hold my breath through every tunnel,
and wish I could get over this feeling of slipping under.
But I never get that far.

Everything's so uncertain.
Can't find the right direction.
You look in the mirror and tell me you see clear.
I lie, say I can see me, but I can't get past this feeling.
I'd talk, but no one listens.
Can't make my own decisions.

Every night I lay asleep,
and try to wake up from this dream.

Numb, but I still feel it crawling under my skin.
I threw it all away, but it still stays the same.
Try and forget my name, but it's something I just can't shake.
I threw it all away, but it still stays the same.

Every night I lay asleep,
and try to wake up from this dream.

But did you know?
I hold my breath through every tunnel,
and wish I could get over this feeling of slipping under.
But I never get that far.
