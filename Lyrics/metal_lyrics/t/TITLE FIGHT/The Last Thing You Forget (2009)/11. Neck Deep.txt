First things first, I'm prepared for the worst tonight
and all this adding up is pulling me back down.
You better keep your distance.
You're stupid, worthless, just for instance.
Honestly, you're on to nothing
by thinking what you thought was something.
You better keep your distance, watch your step,
and don't forget that I know where you sleep at night.
All your support is wearing thin.
Your hope for hope is at an end.
I'll watch your world cave in.
You are neck deep in lies you can't keep.
I'm on to you.
