Thoughts cloud my mind like skyscrapers staring back at me. 
And so I ask them,
"How could you watch our city burn to the ground?"
Black pavement, broken lights.
Everyone is looking for me tonight.
I'm not hiding out, I'm far away.

Thanks to wastedrobin for correcting track #11 lyrics.
