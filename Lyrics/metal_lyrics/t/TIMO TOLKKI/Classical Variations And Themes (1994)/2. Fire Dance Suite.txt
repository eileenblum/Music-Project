Dancing around the fire
We've gathered here tonight
Flames are getting higher
Memories are filling my mind
As I look back through the time
Nothing left to find

You're just a memory from the past now
And now it's time for Fire Dance

Fire is burning my soul
I'll be lost forever
Fire is burning my heart
Until the end of time

In this mysterious place
The fire's showing its face
Secrets are revealed
There is no turning back now
And as the hour draws near
I will burn with fear

You're just a memory from the past now
And now it's time for Fire Dance

Fire is burning my soul
I'll be lost forever
Fire is burning my heart
Until the end of time
