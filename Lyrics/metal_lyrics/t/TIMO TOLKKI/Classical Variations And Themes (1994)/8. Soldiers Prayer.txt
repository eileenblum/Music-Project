Stars shine bright in the sky
Warning you're gonna die
Freezing wind blows across the snow plains
Here all alone
Marching towards the front line
Hoping this is the last time
Fighting for what I don't know
Praying something I can't conceive

Won't you please save my soul
Trying to find my way home
Kill or be killed is the law in this mad game
Won't you please save my life
I'm not ready to die
Just trying to find my way back to home again

What is wrong with the mankind?
All those things that you can find
We just waste our time
War is just another crime
Marching towards the front line
Hoping this is the last time
Fighting for what I don't know
Praying something I can't conceive

Won't you please save my soul
Trying to find my way home
Kill or be killed is the law in this mad game
Won't you please save my life
I'm not ready to die
Just trying to find my way back to home again
