Here I am listening to the silence of the night I know
My life will never be the same again
Still I am strangely calm
Lying here in the silence of the night

All these years I've had this strange feeling that I'm waiting for
Something I just can't explain and maybe now my time has come
Lying here in the silence of the night

All my fears, my hopes, my pain
All these years, these tears, my shame
Could there be something good for me
Lying here in the silence of the night
