[Saana:]
Sitting on the rock I'm staring at the lake
Thought a hundred times could this be a mistake?
Cannot take this anymore so I'm closing my door
I'm ready to go home

All my life I've felt completely alone
Walked this lonely road my pain is all I've known
It is in the tears I've cried it is in the hope that died for me so long ago

And as the hour grows near
I'm not feeling any fear
I will leave this cruel world
Farewell farewell goodbye
