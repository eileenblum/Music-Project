"Isn't it beautiful here"?

I often come here to watch the sunsets
It is so beautiful and silent here always
It almost makes me think there must be something more
'Cause the beauty sometimes almost makes me cry

But I noticed you've already cried, my dear
It ain't easy the road that you've been travelling
But that bottle you try to hide is not the answer either
You can run but you can't hide from your fate

[Saana:]
I have bathed in Autumn rain entwining winter snow
I have kissed Spring blossoms in the Summer rain
But the tears of the ocean echo shadows in my soul
Cradled in my heart

[Damian:]
You will understand the things I say one day
I know that you have suffered much in your life
I know about your father and mother too
There are many things I've come to tell you

Do you know you have a heart of gold
And I can see the light shine in your eyes
You know the meaning of the pain
You have the sadness of the world in your eyes
In your eyes

[Damian:]
"Would you like to come over for a cup of coffee?
How's tomorrow for you? It's cabin number 3 at 7"
