There are things that you don't understand
Your mother, you and me
We are the same, defenders of truth
We've always been here
We are a miracle of creation
We are warriors of the light
Angels in human form
Born to serve

And love is the key
Love is the answer
Open your heart, you'll realize
Love is the key

And love is the door
Love is the glue that keeps
Whole universe together as one
If we'd just learn
That love is the key

[Spoken:]
Before we are born we choose our mission here together with universe
At all times we have a complete free will to choose what's best for us
Universe has no religion but love and compassion

Evil exists and its only goal is to destroy love
There is no God, there is Universal Intelligence that flows through all things
There is no Devil, there is no Hell, there is no punishment, there is only love
There is heaven from where we come from and where we will return
We can come back to Earth if we choose to do so
