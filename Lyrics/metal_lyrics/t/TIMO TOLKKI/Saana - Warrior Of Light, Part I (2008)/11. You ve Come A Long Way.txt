You don't remember me, I remember you
I know you're scared like once I was
Sitting here by the shore, like I did before
And thinking 'bout the winding road
But that road is so long
You must be strong
Learn from each day
Never giving up

Though the ocean is deep
You must carry one
Towards the reason why you're here

Keep the love in your heart
We'll never be apart
We'll meet again one day you'll see
We all have a destiny chosen by ourselves
But later you will understand

You were born with a gift
A secret to hold
Your heart is gold you got to carry on
Soon your pain turns to peace
There's no more fear
And my child we'll meet again
