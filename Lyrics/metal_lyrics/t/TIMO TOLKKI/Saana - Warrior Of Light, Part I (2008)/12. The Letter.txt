[Freya:]
Welcome my dear, my name is Freya, I'm your guide
Many mountains you have climbed, now your path has led you here
You have walked the winding road to the sea of loneliness
There's a reason to all these things my dear

[Saana:]
I have watched the seasons go
I have wondered 'bout this all
Still it's hard to comprehend
Is there meaning there at all

I don't know why I am here
But I know that I feel fear
Can you tell me? Answer me please
Why am I here?

[Freya:]
Go to sleep tomorrow is... a long day
