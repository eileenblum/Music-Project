I believe that mankind is blind to the truth
All hypocrites, mental terrorists and bigots rule the world
I believe, that I believe

I believe that we have lost joy completely
We are out of touch with our feelings and don't know the way
I believe, that I believe

I don't need a bible to tell me how to live
I don't need your advice I got to find my own way

I believe in me and the universe
I believe that life can be beautiful
And that I have the right to be here
I believe

I don't need the plastic god of the church to show the way
I don't want to be controlled, I have my own words to say
