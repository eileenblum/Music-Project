Little boy I miss you
The ice is slowly melting from your heart
Little boy oh how I've missed you
Take my hand and we will never be apart

The taste of ice cream on the first summer day
The smell of cut grass, remember that?

Little boy I miss you
Come to the light and feel the sun
Little boy oh how I've missed you
You used to play into the night and have fun

In the jungle of rules you have found your way
What happened was never you fault

Nobody ever told you that there are
More colours than black and white
Let me show you a new world
Where you don't have to be afraid
I owe that to you, little boy

Nobody ever told you that there are
More colours than black and white
Let me show you a new world
Where you don't have to be afraid
Let me be there for you every day

In this world where everybody's gone insane
You are told what you can do and who you are
Follow me and I will show you a way out from madness
I owe that to you, little boy

Little boy I'm here for you
You can breathe again and feel the life
Little boy I'll always be there for you
Come to the light and feel the sun
