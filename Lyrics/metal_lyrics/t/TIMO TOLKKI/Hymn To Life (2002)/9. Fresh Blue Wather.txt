I'm sitting in this sleazy hotel room
Somewhere along the rocky road of doom
Looking back at my life and wondering what went wrong
Trying to turn these feelings into a song

I guess I've always been some kind of a fake
And sometimes I do feel like a flake
But I see where I have come from so clear
And the weight that I've been carrying many years

Fresh blue waters cleanse me
Give me wisdom and help me find the key
In the lap of the sea I'm free
And the future will be better than the past
I have learned from my mistakes and that will last

It's unbelievable how I did lie
To myself but at least now I know why
I'm so sorry for some things that I have done
I want to make it up and feel the sun
