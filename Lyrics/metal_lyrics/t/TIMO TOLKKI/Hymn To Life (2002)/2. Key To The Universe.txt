Another day is passing by
Nothing feels the same anymore
I see it clear without fear
Complete order in my life
As I look into the blue sky
I feel so much alive
I have never felt like this before

We are the same everywhere
We just want to be loved
We are confused, we are scared
Still we have to find our own way
Life's not always very easy
There are times when it all feels black
But I tell you there is always a way

And the key to the universe is love
And this key could free the mankind
Trust yourself
The voice within will guide you on your path of life
The key to the universe is love
