Looking inside of myself
I feel the rainbow of emotions
Running wild in an open sea
Garden of my soul
Icy cage of my heart
Golden key which opens
The way to the paradise

So far away yet so close
Lies the cradle of my freedom

Every step I take
Every move I make
Finally, now I understand

Everything is clear
There is no more fear
Finally, now I understand

Seeds that I'm planting today
Will be the fruits that
I will pick up tomorrow in my life
It is not easy to change
Courage and wisdom are my partners
Sailing on the sea of eternity
