Don't say willing to kill silly!
Never can I do anymore
What bothering me die....!
Go on deny!
For myself I thick,
I'll willing to kill
For my sake I thick
I'll willing to be ill
For my ache I feel
I'll willing to creep
All my plague
I want care
Thick cooking screaming in crying
One left belief behind
