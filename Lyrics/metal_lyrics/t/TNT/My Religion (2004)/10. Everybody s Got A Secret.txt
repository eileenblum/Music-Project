I can see you caving in on yourself
Going down in to the past
Dark as hell behind the walls where you hide
A little hell that makes you broken inside

Hide if you want to
Cry if it hurts you
But don't worry baby
Everybody's got a secret

Ghosts in the closet
Rust in the faucet
We're all dirty baby
Everybody's got a secret

Demons grow into the lies that feed us
Till we become what we have done
So you've got a stain or two on your sleeve
Believe me so do I and probably three

Hide if you want to
Cry if it hurts you
But don't worry baby
Everybody's got a secret

Ghosts in the closet
Rust in the faucet
We're all dirty baby
Everybody's got a secret

Everybody's got a secret yeah
Everybody's got a secret yeah

Hide if you want to
Cry if it hurts you
But don't worry baby
Everybody's got a secret

Ghosts in the closet
Rust in the faucet
We're all dirty baby
Everybody's got a secret

Hide if you want to
Cry if it hurts you
But don't worry baby
Everybody's got a secret
Got a secret, yeah
Got a secret, yeah
