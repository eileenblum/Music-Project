Now I know more than I ever have
And still I'm just a fool
And I feel something I'm trying not to become
I already am

Now that the morning light has come
Maybe the sun will make my vision strong
And it I still can't find my way
You'll be there, you'll be there

Can it be I'm just a victim of myself
Reflecting the blame
All I know, you just gotta try to rock this world
Not be a fake

Now that the morning light has come
Maybe the sun will make my vision strong
And it I still can't find my way
You'll be there, you'll be there

And when I don't know who I am
And when I can't see how I ever can
I know I'll find a better way
You'll be there, you'll be there

You're like the wind that blows me through it
When I feel tragic and defeated

Now that the morning light has come
Maybe the sun will make my vision strong
And it I still can't find my way
You'll be there, you'll be there

And when I don't know who I am
And when I can't see how I ever can
I know I'll find a better way
You'll be there, you'll be there
You'll be there, you'll be there
