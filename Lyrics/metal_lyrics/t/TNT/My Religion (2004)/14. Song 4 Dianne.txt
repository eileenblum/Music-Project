Maybe she's dancing in trees
Maybe she's laughing
A melody hangs in the air
Maybe she's singing

Maybe she's breathing again
Maybe she's waiting
Free from the prison we're in
Nothing she's wanting

Maybe she's painting the sky
Rainbows above you
Parting the clouds for the sun
To always shine on you
