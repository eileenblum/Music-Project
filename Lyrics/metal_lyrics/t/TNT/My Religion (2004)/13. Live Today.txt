I'm a lucid dream
A hundred million scenes
Spin my mind into spiral clouds
That break me through
And I'm not listening to any doubts you bring
No more time to waste
It's here and now, it's all I taste

Oh say what you wanna say
Oh I'm gonna live today

Kingdoms in the sky
Don't really get me high
I wanna get there from here
But I don't believe it, it's crystal clear
And I am not afraid when I'm feeling sane
I'm just trying to be beautiful in spite of me

Oh say what you wanna say
Oh I'm gonna live today

And I just wan to celebrate this moment I created
From nothing, and I've only just begun

Oh say what you wanna say
Oh I'm gonna live today
Oh say what you wanna say
Oh I'm gonna live, I'm gonna live today
I'm gonna live today
I'm gonna live today
