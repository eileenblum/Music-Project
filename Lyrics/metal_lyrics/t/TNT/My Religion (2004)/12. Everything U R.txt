Did you know you're like a sunrise
After all these starless nights
Opened something I had closed so tight
All my life
Your eyes are deep and easy
So warm and so far reaching
And you know I, I just can't lie

It's not you pretty face, it's everything you are
It's not the love you make, it's everything you are

I could watch you for hours
In a trance, my soul flower
You're my window to the world outside
Show me
How to give like you give
How to love like you love
You blow through me, like a summer wind you pull me in

It's not you pretty face, it's everything you are
It's not the love you make, it's everything you are
And in my darkest place you're never very far
You take my breath away with everything, everything you are

Did you know you're like a sunrise
After all these starless nights
Opened something I had closed so tight
All my life

It's not you pretty face, it's everything you are
It's not the love you make, it's everything you are
And in my darkest place you're never very far
You take my breath away with everything, everything, everything you are

Everything you are
