You know who I really am, don't you girl
Even I don't understand me
You've seen darker days than I've ever known
Still you shine brighter than anyone

Stay in this dream forever
Hoping that tomorrow never comes
To take this life away from me

You said that you're not going anywhere
And I believe you when you say it
But sometimes I forget you're not like the rest
And I go down into my weakness

Stay in this dream forever
Hoping that tomorrow never comes
To take this life away from me
Couldn't be any better
Maybe if tomorrow never comes
Everything ends perfectly

Stay in this dream forever
Hoping that tomorrow never comes
To take this life away from me
Couldn't be any better
Maybe if tomorrow never comes
Everything ends perfectly
