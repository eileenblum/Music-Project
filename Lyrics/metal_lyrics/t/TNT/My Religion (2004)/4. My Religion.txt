This is my life, all that I know, it's who I am
I'm never letting it go
This is my truth, this is my way
There's no better drug, I need it every day

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, like a virus
Running through my veins
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, it's never gonna change, baby
This is my religion

I'm sinned, I'm burned, tarnished and stained
Not an angel but I feel no regret or shame (yeah)
I bleed my words, I drain my voice
But when you love me, I don't have any choice (yeah)

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, like a virus
Running through my veins
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, like a fire
Burning down my pain
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, it's never gonna change, baby
This is my religion
My religionâ¦ yeah

This ain't no game, this ain't no lie
I'm gonna live it every minute till the day I die
I don't care much for those who doubt
I'm not living for them, that's not what it's about

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, like a virus
Running through my veins
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, like a fire
Burning down my pain
Hey, hey, hey, yeah c'mon, c'mon
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, it's never gonna change, baby
This is my religion

My religion, my religion
My religion, my religion
