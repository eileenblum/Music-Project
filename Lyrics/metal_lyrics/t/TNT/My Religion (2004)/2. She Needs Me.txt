Was she thinking
Was she thinking 'bout the life that she's been wasting
Does she break herself to pieces when it all falls apart
Does she know what she's got
Does she know what she wants

I know what she needs
She needs a lot of good loving
I know what she needs
She needs a lot of good loving
I know what she needs
She needs me

Was she hiding
Was she hiding from the things that make her happy
So scared of love that she can only lock it away
Was she building that wall
Was she breaking her fall

I know what she needs
She needs a lot of good loving
I know what she needs
She needs a lot of good loving
I know what she needs
She needs me

Was she waiting
Was she waiting for somebody to adore her
Was she looking for a prince to come and save her someday
Is she running out of time
Is she starting to go blind

I know what she needs
She needs a lot of good loving
I know what she needs
I know what she needs
I know what she needs
I know what she needs
She needs me
