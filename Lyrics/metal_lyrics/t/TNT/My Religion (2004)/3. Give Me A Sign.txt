Give me a sign
Have I committed such a crime?
I don't wanna live
In a world that won't forgive

Give me a sign
Something real, not sublime
The further I run
The harder I become

Give me a sign
Don't make it so hard to find
Got a long way to go
Just to know what I'll know

Give me a sign
Turn this water into wine
Gonna drink till I'm blind
Make love all the time

Give me a sign
A little sun for my shine
Just let me feel
Let the pain start to heal

Give me a sign
I wanna live one more time
Please forgive
All I wanna do is live

Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
All I wanna do is live

Touch me where my tears won't cry
Help me find a dopeless high

Give me a sign
I wanna laugh one more time
Please forgive
All I wanna do is live

Give me a sign
I'm gonna leave this behind
I'm stuck in a dream
All I wanna do is scream

Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
All I wanna do is live
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
All I wanna do is live

All I wanna do, all I wanna do is live
