Talking and talking in circles and nothing is said
Louder and prouder you're crushed in the weight of your head

On top of your pedestal nothing is logical, yeah
It's so confusing, amusing me out of my mind

It's all just invisible noise
Going nowhere that I can follow
If only you'd get to the point
Might make it easier to swallow, swallow, swallow

Hiding, denying you're running and getting nowhere
The answers you're looking for standing in front of your stare

Keep your eyes on the road, take your mind off the load, yeah
It'd so convincing I'm sensing you almost believe it

It's all just invisible noise
Going nowhere that I can follow
If only you'd get to the point
Might make it easier to swallow, swallow, swallow

Keep your eyes on the road, take your mind off the load, yeah
It'd so convincing I'm sensing you almost believe it

It's all just invisible noise
Going nowhere that I can follow
If only you'd get to the point
Might make it easier to swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow
