Last night I saw a lady
Standing by the fire
She smiled and told me
I was always her desire
But you, you came in to my mind
Once again
I knew that love is what I need
'Cause...

[chorus:]
I've been lost without your love
I've been lost without your love
I've been lost without your love
(never ever fall in love again)

Now I, I can't believe
We'll always be apart
You, you took away the
Love in my heart

[chorus:]
I've been lost with out your love
I've been lost with out your love
I've been lost with out your love
