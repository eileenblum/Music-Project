A scream in darkness, a hopeless fight
Eyes that burn in the night
Blood is drippin' from a knife
The ripper's struck, could be your wife
The beast is striking like a dog
The dog is dying in the morning fog
Worn-out resting in his hide
Sleepin' light - with eyes open wide

[chorus:]
Eddie likes torture and pain
But Eddie's crying in the rain
Eddie's got a twisted brain
And neighbours say that he's insane
Then Eddie - strikes again

The dog is wakin' up each night
Revengeful, lonesome with no fright
Eddie's blade, is Eddie's toy
Satan come and get your boy!

[chorus]
