Look in to the sky he's riding
High above the clouds he flies
King of gods, the world is shaking
Look for the blinding light

[chorus:]
Oh tor with the hammer
Oh tor with the hammer

When his hammer hits the air
Watch the lightning strike the earth
From the halls of the mountain king
You  can hear the vikings scream

[chorus:]
Oh tor with the hammer
Oh tor with the hammer
