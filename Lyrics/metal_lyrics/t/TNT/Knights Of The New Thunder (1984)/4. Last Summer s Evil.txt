You were young, baby
And I was on the prowl
Never had much lovin'
Said, "I'm gonna show you how"
I made  you lose your soul
I took control

[chorus:]
Last summer's evil
Last summer's evil
Last summer's evil

Innocence is gone at last
Now I'm sorry, baby
But it was just too fast
I guess you'll understand
I'm a one time man

[chorus:]
Last summer's evil
Last summer's evil
Last summer's evil
