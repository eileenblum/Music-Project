All stand clear of the fire in the night
Arrows through dolls,
To cause an endless fright
Hate is strong-to healed by sin...

[chorus:]
Ready to leave
Ready to leave
Ready to leave
We're ready

Hymns are sung with passion and probity
Voices loud= long live insanity
The enemies are cursed in the name of war
All given the wrath of mighty tor

[chorus:]
Ready to leave
Ready to leave
Ready to leave
