Bearing the swords of steel
So black you can't see
Armored with will to survive
Taking you dead or alive

Hear the roar of our sound
Raging on to the stars

[chorus:]
We're the knights of the thunder
Rock you till the dawn
(we're the) knights of the  thunder
(and) lightning is our song

We are the eye of the storm
Cold dark wind from  the sea
Fear will never be known
Cause our hearts have turned to stone

Hear the roar of our sound
Raging on to the stars

[chorus:]
We're the knights of the thunder
Rock you till the dawn
(we're the) knights of the  thunder
(and) lightning is our song
