Raise your fists high in the air
We will win so don't despair
Fight the evil with our night
We will conquer it's our right

[chorus:]
Get down and prey
Raise and obey
Get down and prey
Raise and obey
It's deadly metal

We're the leaders of this race
There's no time pretenders shall be hazed

[chorus:]
Get down and prey
Raise and obey
Get down and prey
Raise and obey
It's deadly metal
