A firm hold in a new territory
Raise the flag and leave the sign
Gunfire way out in the fields
A touch of death on the borderline
Out west it's a wild bloody country
A barricade on every shore
Riding on, to the storm,
Through the clouds, to the war...
A constitution, a new solution,
To reach for freedom and a new career
A revolution, will seduce ya'
To build a future on a new frontier...
We're looking for a god-fearing hero
Somebody gotta take the fall
A true heartbeats down the defences
Makes a wasteland of every wall
Just 'cause your winning the battle,
Don't mean you're gonna win the war,
Riding on, to the storm,
Through the clouds, to the shore...
