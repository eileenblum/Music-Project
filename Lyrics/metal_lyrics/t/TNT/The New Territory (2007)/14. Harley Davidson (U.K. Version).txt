[Japanese Bonus Track]

Had a dream when I was seventeen
Me and Jane on a mean machine
Spreadin' my wings, now I'm lettin' it loose
Shakin' this cage ('cause) I do what I choose
I gotta ride a Harley - got to feel the Heat
I am addicted to that feelin'
I got to feed my need on my...
Harley - Davidson
Feel the rush passin' 55
Me and my babe in a four stroke jive
Spinnin' my wheels down '66
No doubt about how I'm getting my kicks
Harley - Davidson
