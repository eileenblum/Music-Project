Girl, I'm crazy for your eyes,
Like a killer with a bloodshot disguise
You got a smile like a gateway to heaven
And I'm coming on through...
I'm a sinner with the best of intentions
And you are losing your mind
I shot a kiss from a six-string machine gun,
And I'm way outta line...
I cant go on with this feeling
And I cant go on without
I cant go on with this feeling
And I cant go on without...
Girl, you got a suicidal boogie
With a genocide beat
I'm a crash in car collision heaven
When you dance in my street...
