She's the one I want for love
And nobody else,
She's the one I'm longing for
And nobody else
What we had and what we will
We'll never be apart
She's the one, I'm longing for
We'll share it in our hearts
I'm floating down the milestone waters
I'm crazy 'bout someone's daughter
I'm crazy, I'm falling in love again
God knows, it gives me the shivers,
Floating down that milestone river
God help me, I'm falling in love again..
She's the one I want for love
And nobody else,
She's the one I'm longing for
I'll hit a distant shore
After all that we've been through
I've gotta find her now
She's the one I'm searching for
I'll reach her love somehow.
God help me, I'm falling in love again..
