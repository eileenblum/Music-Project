Running outta time, crazy on your mind
You're gonna throw your life away..
Whisky on the ice, losing on the dice
What can you do but kiss me right ...
Roll another joint and get right to the point
And tell me if you're gonna stay
Look me in the eyes and take me for a ride
And show me every different way we can play...
Hey girl, you gotta wake up and see
Responsibilities been taking a toll on me
Hey girl, you're not born to be free
You are just a golden opportunity
Forget what you've been told, libido overload
You wanna give your love away
Satisfy your soul with some old rock n roll
What can I do to make it right?
Na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na-na...
