[Japanese Bonus Track]

You're coming out really strong
Telling us we Don't belong
Saying we're a bunch of crap,
Into dirt like house and rap.
Let us tell you once again,
You Don't deserve to hang with men.
All the friends you had are gone
Don't tell us that we Don't belong..
So get out of here,
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say
Nothing to say
So get out of here,
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say
Nothing to say
So get out of here...
Do you have to embarrass the crowd?
Do you have to talk out loud?
You're claiming that we all have changed,
That your friends are all deranged
But you have changed dear friend,
Stubborn bastard, never bends
Then it's better for all of us,
That you catch an early bus..
So get out of here,
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say
Nothing to say
So get out of here,
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say
Nothing to say
So get out of here
Don't come too near...
So get out of here,
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say
Nothing to say
So get out of here,
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say
Nothing to say
So get out of here
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say,
Tears of Despair,
So get out of here
Don't come too near
We've got nothing to say,
Nothing to say..
So get out of here,
So get out of here'
So get out of here
All the friends you had are gone
Don't tell us that we Don't belong...
