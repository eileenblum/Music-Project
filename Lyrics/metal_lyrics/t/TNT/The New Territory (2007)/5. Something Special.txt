I' been lyin' here awake all night,
'cause what we got is outta sight.
I' been lyin' here awake all night
'cause what we got is outta sight...
You're something special,
You're a special something
You're something special,
You're a special something...
Don't disappear without a trace
'Cause we're gonna make it,
A psycho-sexual interface
If my heart can take it...
You're something special
Let's do something special.
