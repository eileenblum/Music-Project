You wanna touch me where the sun don't shine
Somewhere deep and closer to your heart
You wanna share that smile, it's mighty fine,
Well you can drive my car yeah..yeah..yeah..
2 seconds away
A new world today
2 seconds away
From your independence day...
2 seconds away
From a , new world today, yeah..yeah..yeah..
Take a jump on a frantic crosstown ride
When you think of the words to say
I see the look on a fallen angels' eyes,
Have you forgotten to pray, yeah..yeah..yeah..
2 seconds away
A new world today
2 seconds away
From your independence day...
2 seconds away
From a , new world today, yeah..yeah..yeah..
You say you've never been sentimental, right?
It's so essential today, yeah..yeah..
A promise under the fading back street lights
Just a shadow away, yeah..yeah..yeah..
2 seconds away
A new world today
2 seconds away
From your independence day...
2 seconds away
From a , new world today, yeah..yeah..yeah..
