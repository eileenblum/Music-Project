We used to gather round the fountain of love
Somehow lost it along the way,
To be sure this wont happen again,
You've gotta come out and shout today...
Ooh, you can join us,
Ooh, come closer now
Let's gather round the fountain of love
Lets gather
Seek shelter from the danger above
Seek shelter...
We should be grateful for the facts of life
That there's something we can do,
We hate this world, but not tonight
We watch the fountain go into the blue...
