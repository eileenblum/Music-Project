Undercover in a dead end town
To save a love from breaking down
The last I heard she was bound for Rio
Alive and kickin' in a black GTO...
Do you really wanna know?
Don't you wanna let me know what is on your mind?
Do you really have to go?
Do you really wanna leave everything behind,
Are you blind!?
A .38 in the lost and found
She disappeared without a sound
Dark eyes and a distant light on
I'll be waiting every road you ride on...
