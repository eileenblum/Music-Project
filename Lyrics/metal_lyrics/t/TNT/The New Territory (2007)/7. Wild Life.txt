I'd write a letter, but it's better if I don't know
If you love me or you're not coming back
You take a lover every summer, so they say so
With deep blue eyes and a jacket of black
Ooh, you wanna rock n roll your life away
It's a wild life...
I heard a rumour you were working for the radio
It might as well be just a matter of fact
You made a record and we played it on the stereo
Now you're a hero and you're back on the track
Ooh, when all I want is you tonight,
Are you alright?
You're livin' it up,
You're livin' it up,
So don't give it up..
Ooh, its a wild life,
You're livin' it up,
You're livin' it up,
You're livin' it up in a real wild life tonight..
