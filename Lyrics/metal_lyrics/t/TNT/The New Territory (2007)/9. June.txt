Oh June,
You gotta let me get inside you
Oh June,
I'll slip into your room
Pull on your cigarette
And slip on something red
June...
A full bodied Chardonnay
When there's nothing more to say,
Is like a shining light in the gloom..
Oh June,
When you are gone, you leave me crying
Oh June,
The very thought of you,
I can see your face in every cloud
June...
Don't you feel blue
Don't you feel bad
You're the greatest love I've ever had
You always love the one you leave,
You always leave the one you love
Oh June...
You will not believe it
Until you see it
Underneath the strawberry moon
Oh June...
