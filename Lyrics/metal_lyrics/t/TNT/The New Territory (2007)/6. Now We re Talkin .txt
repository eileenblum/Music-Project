I saw her standing there
I should have known better
I wanna be your man
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna tell you
I want you
I'll be back
I'll cry instead
I'll follow the sun.

She came in through the bathroom window,
She loves you
She said, she said,
She's a woman
She's leaving home
Wait
We can work it out
What goes on
What you're doing
What's the new Mary Jane

Across the universe Michelle
I wanna hold your hand
All you need is love, Michelle
I wanna be your man..

Now we're talkin'
A day in the life,
Now we're talkin',
A hard day's night,
Now we're talkin',
Eight days a week
Now we're talkin'
Hold me tight..

When I get home
When I'm sixty four
While my guitar gently weeps
Why don't we do it in the road?
With a little help from my friends
Within you, without you
Wild honey pie
Lady Madonna, let it be..

You've gotta hide your love away
Because you drive my car
Good day sunshine come together
Back in the USSR ..

Now we're talkin'
A day in the life,
Now we're talkin',
A hard day's night,
Now we're talkin',
Eight days a week
Now we're talkin'
Hold me tight..

Across the universe Michelle
I wanna hold your hand
All you need is love, Michelle
I wanna be your man..

Now we're talkin'
A day in the life,
Now we're talkin',
A hard day's night,
Now we're talkin',
Eight days a week
Now we're talkin'
Hold me tight..
