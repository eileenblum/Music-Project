Safety is a pair of good shoes
Love is when someone's got the same blues
Blue nights over earth ain't no paradise lost
Bonfires lit not to die of frost
Yeah, I can see it all

I'm a moon - moonflower
On moonlit nights i bloom
I'm a moon - moonflower
On moonless nights I'm doomed
I'm a moon - moonflower

Breath is a matter of survival
Till you, wake up a dream -
And have a clue
And your rockets will fly
On the back - side of June
Though I break down, I break through
Soon, yeah very soon

I'm a moon - moonflower
On moonlit nights I bloom
I'm a moon - moonflower
On moonless nights I'm doomed
I'm a moon - moonflower
