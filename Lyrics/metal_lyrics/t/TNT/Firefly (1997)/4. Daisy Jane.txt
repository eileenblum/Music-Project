I make you crazy
Sometimes I bring you down
That's how I know our seeds were grown
In the same ground
And I believe I've known you for
Least a million days or more
Like the sun that drys my rain

Daisy Jane
You're the only one who understands
You're the reason I'm a better man
You're my life
Daisy Jane

I make you coffee
Sometimes I make you smile
I'd give you all the world
If only I could child
But you'll still get the best of me
Up &amp; down and in between
And you rarely do complain

Daisy Jane
You're the only one who understands
You're the reason I'm a better man
You're my life
Daisy Jane

[Solo]

Yeah i believe I've known you for
Least a million days or more
Like the sun that drys my rain
Daisy Jane
You're the only one who understands
You're the reason I'm a better man
You're my life
Daisy Jane
