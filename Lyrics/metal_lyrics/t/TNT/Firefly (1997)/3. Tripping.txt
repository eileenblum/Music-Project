Gotta lot to learn, gotta lot to live
Gotta lot of time to forgive
But I get jaded, borrowed, faded yeah
Gotta lot to do, gotta lot to be
Not a lot of dreams have come true for me
And the moments come and go like friends
We always drift apart when summer ends
I say there's nothing wrong
You say there's something right
It's hard believing

When I'm tripping down
Got my sky turned 'round
I can almost feel my feet above the ground

Gotta lot of faith even though I'm lost
And It's only you I can trust
Melancholic eyes give me away
Angelic smiles from you keep me sane
I say there's something right
You say there's something strong
I start believing

Then I'm tripping down
Got my sky turned 'round
I can almost feel my feet above the ground

O.K, alright guess I'm looking just a little to hard
But I'm alright now
Just as long as I stay where you are

[Solo]

And I'm tripping down
Got my sky turned 'round
I can almost feel my feet above the ground
