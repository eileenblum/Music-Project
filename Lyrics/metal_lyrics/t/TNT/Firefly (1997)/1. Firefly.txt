Out of breath in my mind i need a window
Something real, something fresh as air
Left this world on a psychedelic joyride
Only thing is that i got nowhere
Dig down to the center of my universe
Yeah for something i don't even know, no
You're the wing, the prayer that i been hoping for
Can you tell me why you hide so low

I am I said inside your head
It's only you &amp; I, I am your firefly

Without you there's no me I'm not together
And my stupid little brain's too slow
So I wait till you come out and play again
Why the hell can't I take control

I am I said inside your head
It's only you &amp; I, I am your firefly
I am I said inside your head
It's only you &amp; I, I am your firefly
I am I said inside your head
If I'm not fed this golden flame will die
And all your words will lie
I am your firefly
