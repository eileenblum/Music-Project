Don't you believe in where you're going
You act like you're afraid of knowing
They washed your brain in filthy water
And you drank it down, in the fear you drowned
And it looks like you're never gonna sleep

Don't like these caravans you follow
Your own hypocrisy you swallow
What kind of god would make you question love?
And your guilt is a sin
They don't know where you've been
And you're dying all the time

Angels ride on the darkest side of your soul
Angels ride on the darkest side of your soul

Ah you know how they ride

Think your love has turned to hate
Think your love might've turned to hate

[Solo]

Angels ride on the darkest side of your soul
Angels ride on the darkest side of your soul
