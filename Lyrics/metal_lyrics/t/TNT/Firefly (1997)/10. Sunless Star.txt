Rise &amp; fall, breathing small,

Chasing demons away
I'm a king in my desert world,

I'm a snake in the shade,

I think you know me well and I know you I do.

Sunless star in a falling sky that's who I've always been.

Well disposed and paralyzed I need a thicker skin.

I'm trying hard to find the words
To say that I won't be here tomorrow,

'Cause I just can't feel today no.

Miles wide where our souls divide, how did you get so pure.
Angel face you're in God's embrace, won't you be my cure.

I think you know me well and I love you

But I won't be here tomorrow,

'Cause I just can't feel today and everything I am is hollow

There's nothing I can hold onto.

I'm coming home to be with you

When I can shine
Sunless star did you go too far chasing demons away
