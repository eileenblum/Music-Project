I thought I knew the answer to the question
It faded then It turned away
The myth of time personified in fragments
That fed into an endless day
Looking for whatever in a neverland
The candlelight was burning low
I held onto the afterglow

In the year of the month of sundays
Could've been me on my way
Could've been anything at all
In the year of the month of sundays
Could've been lost in L.A.
Could've been anywhere at all

I wake up in a dreamy daze and wonder
Just how long you've been there watching me
And maybe I could slip on by unnoticed
But in the end you know that I would be
Oh more that I could see
And on a big blue mountain
Is where I found my peace
It took me for the longest ride
If freedom can be justified

In the year of the month of sundays
Could've been me on my way
Could've been anything at all
In the year of the month of sundays
Could've been lost in L.A.
Could've been anywhere at all

His only time that tells your mind
How long it's been
Now the feelings coming back again
And I don't think I'll be leaving anymore

[Solo]

In the year of the month of sundays
Could've been me on my way
Could've been anything at all
In the year of the month of sundays
Could've been lost in L.A.
Could've been anywhere at all
