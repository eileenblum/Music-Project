Borrowed time let us love together
Nothing lasts forever
Memories never end
Smiling eyes, the girl that I remember
Wild &amp; tender, like a flower in the wind
So how can I say goodbye
When the world shines on tomorrow
One more day, just fades away
But the heart you touched will cry tonight
For an angel lost in paradise

In another life you would be a star
Love would take you far
Like a soldier of the light you'd fight on
In another time love would heal the scars
Loose a battle, win the wars
You're the soldier of the light in my heart

Broken dreams
Never touched your soul
Cause you believed in life
Yeah, you made it your best friend
So, how could faith be a foe
Turn It's back on destiny
And take a life from me
Lonely days just fade away
Still the heart you touched will cry tonight
For an angel shot down in paradise

In another life you would be a star
Love would take you far
Like a soldier of the light you fight on
In another time love would heal the scars
Loose a battle, win the wars
You're the soldier of the light in my heart
