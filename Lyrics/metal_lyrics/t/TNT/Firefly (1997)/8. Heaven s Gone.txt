Underneath the blacklight
Day-glow eyes and busy parasites
Taking their bites
A gathering of drifters
Floating through some kind of neon dream
Apocalyptic subterranean

God has left the building son
Couldn't take the heat inside us
Don't you think we've having fun
Now that heaven's gone

Blinded by the churchlight
Stained glass arms casting their stones again
Riddled with sin
Waiting for an ending
That might be nothing but a fairytale
With all the Mary's you've inhaled

God has left the building son
Couldn't stand the heat inside us
Judgement day has just begun
Now that heaven's gone
God has left the building son
Left us here to find the answer
Can we save our souls from sin
Now that heaven's gone

What if we were spiritless
Walking flesh and nothingness
Would it put your mind to rest
Or make you hold your dying breath
