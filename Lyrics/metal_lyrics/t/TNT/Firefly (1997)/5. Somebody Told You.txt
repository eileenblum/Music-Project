Well you'll never be
Anything but a loser
Better take what you get
You know a beggar can't be a chooser

Somebody told you
Well you got no friends
And nobody's gonna love you, no way
Must be hard to live
With everybody else above you

Somebody told you
God wouldn't hold you if you cried
Somebody told you
Somebody lied

[Solo]

Let 'em crawl through your skin
To the place where lies begin
Tell the world, let them in
To the place where lies begin

Somebody told you god wouldn't hold you if you cried
Somebody told I wouldn't love you till you die
Somebody told you things that would
Cut you down to size
Somebody told you
Somebody lied
