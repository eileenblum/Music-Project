Where does it end?
Now as the day returns
The sun is rising to a darker sky

Though the years have passed
And chances have slipped away
If we lose it now we'll never see
Another day

We live for the sun , don't think about
Tomorrow
Life has just begun

It seems like child's play
Oh they're playing with our lives
Guess they're just too blind to see
It seems like child's play
Cause they're filling us with lies
Now they take our dignity

Love lost in time
Leaves us in memory
Of the days when we were one

Dreams never die
Each night when I close my eyes
I can feel that there's an answer
Just waiting in disguise

Precious life , a hope forever shinin'
With justice for all...

It seems like child's play
Oh they're playing with our lives
Guess they're just too blind to see
It seems like child's play
Cause they're filling us with lies
Now they take our dignity
