A soldier alone
Defending the borderline
His eyes on the run
Looking for a place to hide
And he's wondering why
Tears falling , he fades into darkness
Waiting for dawn to ease the pain - oh

Desperate night
Desperate night
He'll wait for the light

With blood on his hands
The memories are all too clear
To realize the truth
Never makes it disappear
Does anyone hear

Death like a thief has come without a
Warning
Heroes die before the dawn - oh

Desperate night
Desperate night
He'll wait for the light

[Solo]

Desperate night
Desperate night
He'll wait for the light

Desperate night
