I never wanted to settle down
Just a kid on a highway to nowhere
Wishin' for my girl to be real
She would satisfy my soul

10 000 lovers in one
10 000 lovers in one

Seems like I've known her a thousand
Years
We've been together all through our
Lives she knows the way love should be
A fire burning endlessly

10 000 lovers in one
10 000 lovers in one
She's like
10 000 lovers in one

[Solo]

10 000 lovers in one
10 000 lovers in one

10 000 lovers
10 000 lovers
10 000 lovers in one
