Shine for the world
Dance for me again
In my mind
Songs in the sky
Lonely heart alone

Winter so long
Holding me in trance far away
Nights go on &amp; on
They'll be here to stay

Northern lights
Haunting me
I'll be back where I long to be
But the northern lights
Carry on
One more night alone

Walk through the storm
Never fear
My love is real
Dreams captured me , but
I'll be free again from the...

Northern lights
Haunting me
I'll be back where I long to be
But the northern lights
Carry on
One more night alone

[Solo]

Northern lights
Haunting me
I'll be back where I long to be
But the northern lights
Carry on
One more night
On my own
Haunting me
I'll be back
