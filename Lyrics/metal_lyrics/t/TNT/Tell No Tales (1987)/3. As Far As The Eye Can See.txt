Summer of rain
Out of the clouds you came and
Froze my heart
Running alone
I never thought of changing
But now I can't forget you
The days are lost without you

I'm dreaming of long summer nights
And I'm searchin'...

As far as the eye can see
Is much too far for you to be
As long as you're lyin' here
That's all I need to know

I was afraid
You were a gamble in my lonely world
(fear was easy)
I know you'll be here in the end
I'll keep searchin'...

As far as the eye can see
Is much too far for you to be
As long as you're lyin' here
That's all I need to know

[Solo]

I'm dreaming of long summer nights
I'm searchin'

If your eyes could see
What you mean to me
Oh , when you're lying here
That's all I need to know

As far as the eye can see
Is much too far for you to be
As long as you're lyin' here
That's all I need to know
