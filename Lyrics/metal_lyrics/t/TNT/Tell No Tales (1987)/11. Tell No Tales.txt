Out of trouble
For the moment
We live day by day
No more hunters
Out of season
They won't have their way

It's only your life my friends
Only a game

Tell no tales
Tell no tales
Tell no tales
Tell no tales

In abundance
Words come running
With thoughts so confused
Burn the candle
Down at both ends
A life so abused

It's only your life my friends
Only a game

Tell no tales
Tell no tales
Tell no tales
Tell no tales

[Solo]

It's only your life my friends
Only a game

Tell no tales
Tell no tales
Tell no tales
Tell no tales
