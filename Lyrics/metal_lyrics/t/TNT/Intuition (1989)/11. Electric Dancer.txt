[Japanese Bonus Track]

Phantom where are you now
Dancing girl spinning shadows on the wall
I heard your haunting flame
So come inside misty angel, so untame
Turn it up to ten
I think I see your light again
Cause you love to rock n' roll
You're electric
Burning up the night - like a shining star
Turning on the power light
You're a dancer
Moving through the night
Like a shooting star
Ready to explode right outta sight

Phantom behind your vale
Wanna touch you, hold your silver strings
Shine lady, forever you will dance
I'll be waiting - immortal romance
Can I realize
A love that seems to fantasize
When the music takes control

You're electric
Burning up the night
Like a shining star
Turning on the power light
You're a dancer
Moving through the night
Like a shooting star
Ready to explode right outta sight
