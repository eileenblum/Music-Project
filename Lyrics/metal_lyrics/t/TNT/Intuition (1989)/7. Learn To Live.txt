Why do they try so hard, is it easier that
Way?
Why should they be so cold, are their
Lonely hearts too tough to play?
If they could see through the eyes of a
Child
Through the mystery of time
Visions cry in the hearts of the wild

Are we too young to know
No we understand it
We've got to let it show
And maybe we can learn to love

It's like they were never there even
Though they talk about it
Remember the beauty within
But now it seems they can live without it
If they could see through the eyes of a
Child
Through the mystery of time
Visions cry in the hearts of the wild
Hearts of the wild!

Are we too young to know
No we understand it
We've got to let it show
And maybe we can learn to love

[Solo]

Are we too young to know
No we understand it!
We've got to let it show
And maybe we can learn to love

Are we too young to know
No we understand it!
We've got to let it show
And maybe we can learn to love

Hearts of the wild

Are we too young to know
No we understand it!
We've got to let it show
And maybe we can learn to love

Hearts of the wild

Are we too young to know
No we understand it!
We've got to let it show
And maybe we can learn to love
