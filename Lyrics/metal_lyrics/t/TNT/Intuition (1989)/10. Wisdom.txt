Through timeless change in my dreams
I am closer
From ageless memories, long ago
To enlightened frontiers
I'll take you there oh mystic child
Together, wherever we fly

Somehow I feel like I'm going through
Changes
And sometimes I wake up still dreaming
Only a lifetime can fill in the pages
A story of wisdom for all

Through shadows past, into life
Came a sorcerer
Unchained his energy, running free
The wisdom inside will be
A force in time
We'll carry on
Together, whenever we die

Somehow I feel like I'm going through
Changes
And sometimes I wake up still dreaming
Only a lifetime can fill in the pages
A story of wisdom for all

[Solo]

A force in time
We'll carry on
Together, whenever we die

Somehow I feel like I'm going through
Changes
And sometimes I wake up still dreaming
Only a lifetime can fill in the pages
A story of wisdom for all
