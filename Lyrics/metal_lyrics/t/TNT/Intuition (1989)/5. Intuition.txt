One fire
A silent storm in every spirit
Locked behind a lonely dream still aware
When soldiers of fortune take your mind
The heart is your kingdom
Like magic when you find

Intuition
One decision
Hold your heartbeat in your hand
Intuition, one decision
Let your dream command

One answer
The destiny of every moment
Lost inside a hungry voice in the dark
No evil illusions
No empty prayer
The heart is your kingdom
So follow if you dare

Intuition
One decision
Hold your heartbeat in your hand
Intuition, one decision
Hold your heartbeat in your hand

[Solo]

When soldiers of fortune take your mind
The heart is your kingdom
Like magic when you find

Intuition
One decision
Hold your heartbeat in your hand
Intuition, one decision
Let your dream command
