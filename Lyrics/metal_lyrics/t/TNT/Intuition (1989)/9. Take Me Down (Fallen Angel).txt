Hey girl I'm a secret to you
A face in the crowd
Hey little angel I've been following you
I know where you're going
And when the full moon rises I'll be
There

Are you lonely
Ah you know I'm lonely to
But I'm ready, ready for love, I'm coming
For you

Take me down my fallen angel
Spread your wings tonight
Take me down my fallen angel
Lay your heart on the line
You won't be lonely anymore

Hey girl with your head in the clouds
A pocket full of dust
Now lady evil there's no need to be cruel
The life you've been given is the only
Thing worth livin' for

Are you lonely
Ah you know I'm so lonely too
Are you ready
Ready for love, I'm coming for you

Take me down my fallen angel
Spread your wings tonight
Take me down my fallen angel
Lay your heart on the line

Take me down my fallen angel
Spread your wings tonight
Take me down my fallen angel
Lay your heart on the line
On the line!

[Solo]

I can feel it now my fallen angel
You won't be lonely

Take me down my fallen angel
Spread your wings tonight
Take me down my fallen angel
Lay your heart on the line
