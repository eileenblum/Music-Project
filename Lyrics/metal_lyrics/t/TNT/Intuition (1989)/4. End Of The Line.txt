I've seen the madness of love in flames
I've seen your eyes reflect the silent pain
Now like a candle in this empty room
I burn alone

You've seen the lonely days never end
You've seen break the trust that you depend on
Don't close your heart too fast
Cause feelings will blind you
My love will find you...

End of the line,Reach out in time
Maybe love will come again, my friend
Open your eyesLove never dies
Don't run away
Cause you just can't say
That this is the end

We've learned to gamble the distance game
Hearts of steel, they'll never bend
So close behind the walls like strangers
That blind us
Love will find us

End of the line
Reach out in time
Maybe love will come again, my friend
Open your eyes
Love never dies
Don't run away
Cause you just can't say
That this is the end

[Solo]

End of the line
Reach out of time
Maybe love will come again, my friend
Open your eyes
Love never dies
Don't run away
Cause you just can't say
That this is the end...
