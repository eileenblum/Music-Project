You caught me like a gray field mouse
By the tail and you were holding me up
High enough I didn't notice then
That you were waiting for the moment to come
You held me in your feline trance
And I thought that I could make it back
Far enough to understand you
But I was always digging out of a hole
I don't know why, I don't know why but I need you
I don't know why, I don't know why but I want to

You found me in my darkest light,
By the way you even said that you liked it
Well enough to wanna share with me
Some kinda life that maybe couldn't be no

I don't know why, I don't know why but I need you
I don't know why, I don't know why but I want to
I don't know why, I don't know why but I got to
Give myself away and let
You chase me through another day
Yeah... you got me in a mousetrap
Yeah... you got me in a mousetrap

So there we are running on the fence
And it's hard to say which way it'll go
But we both know it's really out to you
Been in your pocket
Since the first hello....hello....hello!

I don't know why, I don't know why but I need you
I don't know why, I don't know why but I got to
Give myself away and let you chase
Me through another day
Yeah.....you got me in a mousetrap
