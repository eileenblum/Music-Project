Wanna touch the world outside of me
Get out of my head
Stop telling myself lies I believe,
Then make them true
I could change my way of thinking yeah
Well easier is a new day
There is no such thing as forever son
Mama said, mama said
You can change your life for a better one
Mama said, mama said

Wanna not care what they think of me
And still be sociable
Retain my own identity, and know I'm good
Without seeking anyone's approval
I'm better than that
And today is a new day

There is no such thing as forever son
Mama said, mama said
You can change your mind like the weather son
Mama said, mama said
Live your life as you please,
Free of fear, free of doubt
It's the hardest thing you'll have ever done
Mama said, mama said

Your watching me, I'm watching you,
We're watching everything they do
Sometimes we try so hard we die
And then we lose the game

Live you life as you please,
Free of fear, free of doubt.....
It's the hardest thing you'll have ever done
Mama said

There is no such thing as forever son
Mama said, mama said
You can change your life for a better one
Mama said, mama said
There is no such thing
There is no such thing
