I believe you and I will live forever
But more than anything I don't believe in time
All we need is freedom from the lie
That we'll get old and frail and then probably die
We can walk on water if we believe it
We can dance on fire and we can breathe it
There is no great mystery if we'd
Only look to see just what is there

Wide awake everything's in technicolor
All the energy exploding in my eyes
Dead asleep in downward spiral falling
I tripped the light and saw the magical was true

We can walk on water if we believe it
We can dance on fire and we can breathe it
There is no great mystery if we'd
Only look to see just what is there

Open up and let it through if you really
Want it to then just be here

We can walk on water if we believe it
We can dance on fire and we can breathe it
There is no great mystery if we'd
Only look to see just what is there

What is there?
