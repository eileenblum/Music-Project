Feed my head, get me high
Got no life here so
I need to be pacified
One more face, one last show
Wasting brain cells
I'm just waiting for the time to go
Hypnotize, hypnotize me

Everybody loves you
When the nights are long
All the lonely people
Sing your happy songs

Zone me out, bleed me dry
Drug my senses till I'm
Cold a little dead inside
Just like god you've become
All consuming bring the world
Into every home

Hypnotize, hypnotize me

Everybody loves you
When the nights are long
All the lonely people
Sing your happy songs

Hypnotize, hypnotize me

Everybody loves you when
When the nights are long
All the lonely people
Sing your happy songs
