Could've done the best you could
Could've paid more attention
Could've not been self absorbed all the time
Could've given me respect
Could've answered honestly
Could've helped me to relate to the world
Some of my friends had it worse,
Some were better off than me
All the same somehow we are
Looking for sanity
I'm thankful to be alive, I'm so lucky I can be
Where I am at any time
No one to blame now but me
If I come crashing down yeah

Could've easily reached out
Could've opened up your eyes
Could've protected me from cruel people
Could've taken full control
Could've understood your role
Could've meant so much to me, but it's all right

Some of my friends had it worse,
Some were better off than me
Hard to say who's more fucked up
It's strange reality
I'm thankful to be alive, I'm so lucky I can be
Anywhere at anytime
No one to blame no but me

Some of my friends had it worse,
Some were better off than me
Guess we're all on the same ride
One big happy family
I'm thankful to be alive, I'm so lucky I can be
Where I am at anytime
No one to blame now but me
If I come crashing down
