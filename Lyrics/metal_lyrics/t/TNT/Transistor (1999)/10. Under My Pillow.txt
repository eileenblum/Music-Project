Hello, how are you it's been so long
I'm sorry that I haven't tried to call
I often wonder where you are
And if it's far, very far
I know I promised we'd always be friends
I really wanted to but she wouldn't bend
I had a family that I truly loved
With all my heart, all my heart

Under my pillow
I'll place a wish for you tonight
Under my pillow,
That all your dreams have come to life
(Under my pillow)
I always look for you on T.V.
I think I see you sometimes maybe
I guess you've got a family of your own
A lovely home, love is home

Under my pillow
I'll place a wish for you tonight
Under my pillow,
That all your dreams have come to life
(Under my pillow)
Here they come, here they come

And all the years they drifted
They're going faster now
And all the time we wasted
It's running faster now, faster now

It goes on and on, on and on

Under my pillow
I'll place a wish for you tonight
Under my pillow
That all your dreams have come alive
(Under my pillow)
