Met a girl from south buenos aires
With a smile like the warm Spanish sun
And we danced in the arms of san pedro
Went as far as our horses could run
In her dark chocolate eyes I was captured
In the full moon my soul couldn't hide
As we drank her homemade sangria
Sevillanas played on through the night
She's still loving, me in my fantasy
And if we're meant to be I just might make it back

Y estrano a mi dulce senorita
(and I still miss my sweet senorita)
But I fear that her heart let me go
And that somebody new has embraced her
If I stay here I never will know

She's still lovin, me in my fantasy
And if we're meant to be I just might make it back
She's still lovin, me in my crazy dream
And if we're meant to be I just might make it back

She's still lovin, me in my fantasy
And if we're meant to be I just might make it back
She's still lovin, me in my crazy dream
And if we're meant to be I just might make it back

You know I will now, yeah you know I will
Oh if you want me to I'll be
With you
Make this dream come true
Woah...yeah....oh yeah
Cause if we're meant to be
That's where I'm gonna be
All I wanna do yeah, yeah
Come right back to you
Back to you
