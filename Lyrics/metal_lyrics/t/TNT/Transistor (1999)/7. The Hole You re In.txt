Hey... where you been
Where you been my little goddess
Hey... you get me off
Then you cut me off till I'm breathless
Where you going when the lights are low
Got no feeling from the strain god knows
I can't take it if you pull me down again
Down into that, into that hole you're in

Hey I don't need,
I don't need this aggravation no
Hey you give me twenty-four
Hour frustration!

Where's the sunshine that you used to show
I don't recognize your face, it used to glow
You only call me when you're falling down again
Get out of that, out of that hole you're in

Where you going when the lights are low
Got no feeling from the strain god knows
Where you going when you don't
Know where you been
Get out of that, out of that hole you're in

Hey what you got, what you got
Is what you asked for
Hey and now you're telling me
The devil's at your back door

Where you going when the lights are low
I don't the girl I used to know
I won't let you take me down that hard again
Get out of that, out of that hole you're in
