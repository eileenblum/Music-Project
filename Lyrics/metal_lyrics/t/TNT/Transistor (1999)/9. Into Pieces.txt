I'm falling into melancholic days
The kind that make you wish that you were ten
When the world was a playground
And I, I'm dwelling on the possibilities
Dreaming up a big scenariosensing you're about to let me go
(but I say)

Don't, don't break my heart into pieces baby
Don't, don't break my heart into pieces baby

I remember how people used to stare
With smiles of envy wishing that were us
We shined so pure across the universe
And you, you always radiated like the sun
You stood by me, yeah made me look so good
I know I didn't treat you like I should
(but I say)

Don't, don't break my heart into pieces baby
Don't, don't break my heart into pieces baby
Oh no, don't break my heart into pieces baby
Don't , don't break my heart..........dont'break it!

When you love someone and they don't love you
It's time to take a break from what you used to do
When you want someone and they don't want you
It's hard to be objective, butcha got to
Well I need, don't need you're money,
Don't need a dime
I just need your love here beside me
Well I don't need your money, don't need a dime
I just always thought you'd be here all the time
Don't, don't break my heart into pieces baby
Don't, don't break my heart into pieces baby
Oh no, don't break my heart into pieces baby
