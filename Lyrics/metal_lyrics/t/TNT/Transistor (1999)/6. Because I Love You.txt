The paper said there'd be snow on Monday
By Tuesday morning the clouds would break
But now it's been a week
And still I haven't seen the sky
Holding out, I've been pravin'
For a shadow of doubt
It's cold outside but I don't care
I'll wait for you... I will
Now Wednesday came with a gift of sunlight
It kissed my face and it got me high
And for a moment
I knew that I would be all right

And it's all because I love you
I've got so much to prove
Cause everybody knows but you
And That's shame oh yeah
It's all because I love you
No matter what you do
It's cold outside but I don't care
I'll wait for you... I will

It's all because I love you
It's everything I do
And everybody knows it's true
Except for you... my dear
That's why I'm holding out
I been prayin' for a shadow of doubt
It's cold outside but I don't care
I'll wait for you... I will

It's all because I love you
I've got so much to prove
It's all because I want ya
To know it's true, oh yeah
It's all because I love you
No matter what you do
And if we're not together
Well I'll always be your friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh That's right baby,
Cause it's all about the love
Yes it's all about the love yeah
That I have for you
