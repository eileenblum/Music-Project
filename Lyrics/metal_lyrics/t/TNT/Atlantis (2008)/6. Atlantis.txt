Down through the ages
Lost in the pages of time
A land for the heroes
A dawn full of reason and rhyme
A tale for believers

A sign for the darkest deceiver
A song for the dreamer
Who longs, to be closer and closer to love...

You'll never find your way to Atlantis
For it was never there
What a wonderful dream for romantics
Like music in the air...

Under the ocean
Deep down emotion
Sleeping endeavour
Dreams take forever
Memories of dark times
Lost in the moonlight
Somewhere a whisper
That's calling you closer and fooling your heart...
