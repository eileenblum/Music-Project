Honey, taste of honey,
You are the sweetest thing I've ever had
Honey, honey,
You are the taste that really makes me glad

Honey, taste of honey
You are the princess of the band,
Honey... sweet naturally

Oh, oh - Our love is never ending
Oh, oh - Finger lickin' sweet,
Oh, oh, Our love is never ending,
Oh... Honeybee

Honey, taste of honey
Dripping out of my hand
Honey, honey,
It's sugar candyland

Oh, oh - Our love is never ending
Oh, oh - Finger lickin' sweet...
Oh, oh - The perfume you are sending
Oh, oh - Our love is never ending
Oh... Honeybee
