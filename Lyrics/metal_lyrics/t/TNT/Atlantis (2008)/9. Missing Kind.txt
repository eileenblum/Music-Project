I don't want to be waiting for you
I've been waiting for too long
I just wanna be closer to you
Closer to you, love so strong

Oh, so sweet, you gotta tell me when I'm all outta line
And you're oh, so sweet..

Don't wanna be the missing kind,
Don't wanna be the last in line,
Don't wanna press play / rewind
Don't wanna be missing time...

I don't wanna be searching for you,
I've been searching for a while
I'm just happy that I have found you
That I walked the extra mile...

Oh, so sweet
You gotta tell me when I'm all outta line
And you're oh, so sweet...
Tell me baby, what's on your mind
And you're oh, so sweet...
