It feels like a Saturday night tonight,
Not like a Monday night,
Not like you're out of sight
We've both been travellin' way too long
But our friendship's strong, We know that we belong
We gotta bring out a cheer...

Two friends and a bottle of wine
Both feeling fine, a bottle of wine
Two friends and a bottle of wine
Both feeling fine, a bottle of wine
We gotta drink it all up!

We are discussing the cloudy past
What couldn't really last
But our friendship has
So, we are finally here today, we've got a lot to say,
Let's bring it out, so hey! We gotta drink it all up!
