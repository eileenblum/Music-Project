My father told me long ago
Hey listen son, you ought to know
I've been a young man, just like you
I've had my dreams, a future, too

I've been across the seven seas
That's how I found my inner peace
Discovered ways to ride the storm
I showed respect and did no harm

So don't, go too far,
Get to know who you are
Learn to live and give...

Under the moon
I can see you now
You are smiling
Under the moon
I can see you now
You are waiting
Under the moon, I can see

Hey listen son, you know by now
That you cant make the angels bow
Your family is who you are
Live in love and fly with stars

But don't go too far
Get to know who you are
Learn to live and give

My father told me long ago
Hey listen son, you ought to know.
I've been a young man, just like you
I've had my dreams, a future, too
I had my dreams, a future, too
