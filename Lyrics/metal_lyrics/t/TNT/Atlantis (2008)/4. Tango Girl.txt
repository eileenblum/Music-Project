She's my tango girl, I love her dearly
She's my tango girl, I see her clearly...
She's my tango girl,
I must be dreamin'
In our tango world...

When we have fun
I do really hope we're never done
In our tango world
When she is gone
I can hardly wait for her to come

She's my tango girl
She's my tango girl,
She is delicious.
She's my tango girl,
so pale and so precious.
She's my tango girl,
I hope she's not leaving,
In my tango world,
There's no fandango girl
No, no, no...
