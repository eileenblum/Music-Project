David Niven wouldn't know what to think
I bet he'd never seen a panther so pink
Stick to the radio, you're alright Jack,
Think of Sophia Loren and don't look back...

You're cuttin' the scene
No-one could believe
Ustinov could have lived that dream

You remind me of Peter, number # 1 in his time
And you have to admit, he was one of a kind
Just a friend of the family, that don't have a care
(Mr.) Peter Sellers, are you there?

Take your pills and put Britt Ekland on,
Hey big spender, got no mind of your own,
Go powder your pussycat nose
Now that Hollywood's your home, I suppose

A turn of a page
And out with a rage,
James Bond walked right off that stage...

You remind me of Peter, number # 1 in his time
And you have to admit, he was one of a kind
Just a friend of the family, that don't have a care
(Mr.) Peter Sellers, are you there?

There's no way of telling
From ' A Shot In The Dark',
Where your life may be heading
And the broken hearts
But there weren't no stoppin'
'Till it fell apart
Are you lonely ? Oh, Oh, Oh...

You know the minute that you walked in the joint,
Kubrik and Blake cut right to the point
Dr. Strangelove and his nuclear toy,
I guess you've always been a little boy...

You're setting the scene
No-one would believe
Ustinov should have lived that dream...
