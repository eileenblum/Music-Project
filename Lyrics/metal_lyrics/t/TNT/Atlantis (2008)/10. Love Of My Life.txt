I could have been an L.A. film star
You could have been an opera queen
But I couldn't act to save my life
And you couldn't sing, so we split the scene

It don't matter where we go tonight
We've got all the time in the world

You, shine like an evening star
I'm gonna, run before you get too far,
I'm gonna, smile when you're in my arms
You are the, love of my life

We could have lived like the Onassis'
Sailing in some pacific dream,
Playing canasta in sunglasses
Sipping champagne down on our knees

I wouldn't want no place to go
If you weren't here by my side
Holding hands, ain't made no plans
Than to be with you tonight

We could have caught a late night flight
Taking us out to somewhere blue
But I couldn't fly to save my life
And red was the shade that suited you.
