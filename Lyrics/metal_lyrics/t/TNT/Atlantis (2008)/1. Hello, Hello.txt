Hello, hello, hello,
How are you?
It was good to see ya,
It was good to see ya

No-one's gotta hold on you,
You've spent your whole life running wild
Livin' lovin' London town
In the days of '65

A sharp cut suit and a chrome Lambretta
Took you down to Brighton beach
A bag of blues and a Yardbirds tune
With the weekend at your feet

All your life you've been trying
To find a road that turns back time
You're still flying
Those days are dying...

Hello, hello, hello
How are you ?
It was good to see ya
It was good to see ya

Hello, hello, hello
How are you ?
I can see you're looking good,
It was good to see ya...

Heading down on the 10.15
All the way to sea and sand,
No-one's gotta hold on you
Or the music of the band
There's nothing like a memory
To make it all come flooding back...

All your life, you've been riding,
To the sun that kissed the sky,
But it's time, to say goodbye...
