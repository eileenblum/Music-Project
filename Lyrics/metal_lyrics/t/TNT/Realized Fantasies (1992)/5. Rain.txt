We could be together here in the darkest hour
Hand in hand two lovers out in the cold
Cause I believe there's still a chance we can make it
Love will always be out fortress of gold

And I can't sleep at night
When you're in pain call my name
No matter where you are, I'll be there

Oh, if the rain must fall
Let it fall on me right through it all
Yeah, I will cover you
Cause it's only the rain that gets through

It's always easy to run away when you're feeling helpless
Stick around to find what you've been looking for
Yeah, you can run forever trying to get it right
When you think you've got it, you'll be wanting more

And I can't sleep at night
When you're in pain call my name
No matter where you are, I'll be there

And I can hear the thunder rolling in
The raging wind could never touch our love now baby

Oh, if the rain must fall
Let it fall on me right through it all
Yeah, when the sky turns black
Give it all away honey don't look back

I wanna tell you
Oh, if the rain must fall
Let it fall on me right through it all
Yeah, I will cover you
Cause it's only the rain that gets through

And I can hear the thunder rolling in
The raging wind could never touch our love now baby
Love now baby, love

Oh, if the rain must fall
Let it fall on me right through it all
Yeah, when the sky turns black
Give it all away honey don't look back

I wanna tell you
Oh, if the rain must fall
Let it fall on me right through it all
Yeah, I will cover you
Cause it's only the rain that gets through

I gotta tell you
Oh, if the rain must fall
Let it fall on me right through it all
Yeah, when the sky turns black
Give it all away honey don't look back

I wanna tell you
Oh, if the rain must fall
Let it fall on me right through it all
Yeah, I will cover you
Cause it's only the rain that gets through
