Take me there, warm winds blow through the air
And love is all that we know
Harmony, some kind of fantasy that I can never let go

And I don't know where I am going
Or understand it all
So help me keep my river flowing
When the water falls

And I'll keep on searching
For my Indian Summer

Firewind, breathe on my heart again
Before the winter takes hold
Always strange how seasons, people change
We try, we live, we grow old

And there's a beauty that surrounds you
An aura like the sun
So let me wrap my arms around you
Until our dream is done

And I'll keep on searching
For my Indian Summer
And I'll keep on searching
For my Indian Summer

Bombs fly through liquid skies of gray
The eagle landed, she's empty-handed
Why can't we learn from our mistakes
And love each other
We might discover
Indian Summer

And I'll keep on searching
In a world going under
For a sign of magic
For my Indian Summer
