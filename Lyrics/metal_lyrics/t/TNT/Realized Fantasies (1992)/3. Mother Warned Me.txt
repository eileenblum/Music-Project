One percent of nothing
Is always one percent
Hard to hold renegade
He calls the wind his friend
Taking care of business
According to demand
But if you have to ask him why
You'll never understand

Full throttle living
And a suicide smile
Push it to the limit
You're doing it in style

Mother warned me about you
And all those horror stories came true
Mother warned me about you
That's what makes it cool
Mother warned me
Yeah, she warned me

Hardcore righteous brother
He's never growing old
You're calling him black-hearted
But he's got a heart of gold
The eagle soars alone you know
When it's time to jam

But if you have to ask him why
You'll never understand

Full throttle living
And a suicide smile
Push it to the limit
You're doing it in style

Mother warned me about you
And all those horror stories came true
Mother warned me about you
That's what makes it cool
Mother warned me
Mother warned me about you
And all those horror stories came true
Mother warned me about you
That's what makes it cool
Mother warned me

Full throttle living
And a suicide smile
Never gonna give in
You're doing it in style

Mother warned me about you
All those horror stories came true
Mother warned me about you
That's what makes it cool
Mother warned me
Mother warned me about you
And all those horror stories came true
Mother warned me about you
That's what makes it cool
Mother warned me
That's what makes it cool
Yeah, she warned me
Mother warned me
'bout you...
