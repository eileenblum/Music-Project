Purple mountain's majesty
Yellow sky and blackened sea
Will God shed His grace for you and me

Colors clashing one by one
A bigot's work is never done
So this is the land of the free

An eye for an eye, we'll all be blind
If you got a gun, you're doing fine

Let the people sing, bells of freedom ring
Let the people shout, till there can be no doubt
Let the people sing, bells of freedom ring
Hear the voices roar, we won't take this anymore

Purple mountain's majesty
Hungry eyes on broken streets
And ice cracks the sidewalk cabaret

Moral psychos run the show
Tunnel vision starts to grow
And blood spills like water on the stage

Gotta do what we can to right this wrong
For tomorrow's child we must be strong

Let the people sing, bells of freedom ring
Let the people shout, till there can be no doubt
Let the people sing, bells of freedom ring
Hear the voices roar, we won't take this anymore
Purple mountain's majesty

Let the people sing,
Let the people shout
Let the people sing
Hear the voices roar
Let the people sing, bells of freedom ring
Let the people shout
Purple mountain's majesty
Let the people sing, bells of freedom ring
Let the people shout, till there can be no doubt
Let the people sing, bells of freedom ring
Hear the voices roar, we won't take this anymore
