You got no protection, you got no control
It's like a good injection baby
That won't let your body go, oh no
Lie down sugar, take your own sweet time
Take it slow little girl, make it rock, make it rhyme
Keep on revving, let your motor burn hot
I can feel it grinding baby
Like a top, top never gonna stop
Come downtown, let the pasion play
Keep on sexing me till your dying day

All you need is love, love is what you need
All you need is love every single day
All you need is love, love is what you need
All you need is love, yeah loving every single day

Take me to the mountains
Lay me in the sea
Let me taste your fountain baby
Gonna make my night complete
C'mon let your wicked soul unwind
Shake it loose little girl, keep your body right on time
Keep on revving, let your motor run hot
Push it to the floor, yeah we're never gonna stop

All you need is love, love is what you need
All you need is love every single day
All you need is love, love is what you need
All you need is love, yeah loving every single day

Keep on revving, let your motor run hot
I feel you grinding baby, feels like we're never gonna stop

All you need is love, love is what you need
All you need is love every single day
All you need is love, love is what you need
All you need is love, loving every single day
