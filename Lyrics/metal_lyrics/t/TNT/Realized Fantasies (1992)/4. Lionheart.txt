He downs another shot
It's the end of the day
He's never gonna leave
But he doesn't wanna stay here wanting

Drinking to the past
For which he has no use
Smiling for the camera
But he's singing the small-town blues

You know so many women so little time
A lonely man's favorite drunken lie

Why do we have to fall from grace
Holding on to yesterday
When home sweet home is out of place
Lionheart will find his way

Crying for her man
She's waiting by the phone
But he's making one last stop
Cause he hates to drink alone in shadows

Trapped inside a dream
A childhood desire
Says he's off to California
But you know he's a liar

And now there's nothing lost, yeah
There's nothing gained
Morning comes and it's still the same

Why do we have to fall from grace
Holding on to yesterday
When home sweet home is out of place
Lionheart will find his way
Do we have to fall from grace
Holding on to yesterday
When home sweet home is out of place
Lionheart will find his way

And now there's nothing lost, yeah
There's nothing gained
Morning comes and it's still the same

Do we have to fall from grace
Holding on to yesterday
When home sweet home is out of place
Lionheart will find his way
Do we have to fall from grace
Holding on to yesterday
When home sweet home is out of place
Lionheart will find his way
