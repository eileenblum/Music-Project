Well I'm dancing through my fantasy
Seemed like everything was right
Yeah I wrapped your love around me
Put my head down in your hands
But I never saw the lights

Well, I stood beside insanity
She looked at me and smiled
She said "boy when I was young I had dreams a lot like you
And I held on for a while"

A faded picture, black and white
A silhouetted memory gone by
The meter's running, you can't save time
Easy Street has no parking signs
Easy Street has no parking signs

Faster than a laser beam
She came to me, a song in my dreams
Better keep my motor running so I'll never miss a beat
Down on easy Street

So I'm cruising through this fairy tale
Or was it just the wine
Still I know I'm just a kiss away
There's nothing more to say
Cause she's heard all the lines - twice

A faded picture, black and white
A silhouetted memory gone by
The meter's running, you can't save time
Easy Street has no parking signs
Easy Street has no parking signs

I'd fly across the stars for you
Do it all for you babe
I'm still here after all that we've been through
I've lost the dice, I've paid my dues
Do it all for your love
For one last time you know I'd bleed again for you

A faded picture, black and white
A silhouetted memory gone by
The meter's running, you can't save time
Easy Street has no parking signs
A faded picture, black and white
A silhouetted memory gone by
The meter's running, you can't save time
Easy Street has no parking signs
Easy Street has no parking signs
