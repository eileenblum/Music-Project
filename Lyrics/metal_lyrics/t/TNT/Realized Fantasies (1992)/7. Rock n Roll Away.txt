Running blind, tonight I'm gonna crash in a nameless town
Your lovelight shines so guide me through a ride on this merry-go-round
No disguise could shatter my smile, cover my intentions
It's in your eyes, I know you didn't come under false pretensions

I've been around the world and there is no destination
Sweet mama take my hand and we'll dance right through temptation

Well I might forget you
But I still respect you
When I rock 'n' roll away
Don't believe in sorrow
So don't cry tomorrow
When I rock 'n' roll away

Gypsy girl you're playing shy but your smile is showing
It's a one way ride one more song'll take us where we're going

I don't know when this will end, yeah I lost my reservation
Chasing my tail again, it's a no-win situation

Well I might forget you
But I still respect you
When I rock 'n' roll away
Don't believe in sorrow
So don't cry tomorrow
When I rock 'n' roll away
Well I might forget you
But I still respect you
When I rock 'n' roll away
Don't believe in sorrow
So don't cry tomorrow
When I rock 'n' roll away

I've been around the world and there is no destination
So darling take my hand, it's a no-win situation

Well I might forget you
But I still respect you
When I rock 'n' roll away
Don't believe in sorrow
So don't cry tomorrow
When I rock 'n' roll away
Well I might forget you
But I still respect you
When I rock 'n' roll away
Don't believe in sorrow
So don't cry tomorrow
When I rock 'n' roll away
