I guess I've never been good at telling you that I'm fully aware of all the things you do, the grace you bring into my life.
The pride I feel knowing I'm yours, you're mine.

We'll never break it
We're gonna make it

Cold as the night in December
Dark as a heart left alone
I'm no longer here
I just disappeared
Lost like a child without mother

True
I could have done it so much better
Yes
I wrote it in a letter
Still
I thought our love would last forever
Now we made it
We'll never break it

Once in a lifetime you find it
Just like a gift from above
You know without a doubt
That you can deal without
You been its true incarnation

True
I could have done it so much better
Yes
I wrote it in a letter
Still
I thought our love would last forever
Now we made it
We'll never break it

We're gonna make it

We'll never break it
We'll never break it
We're gonna make it

True
I could have done it so much better
Yes
I wrote it in a letter
Still
I thought our love would last forever
Now we made it
We'll never break it

We're gonna make it
We're gonna make it

So, remember these words I say and how much they mean.
That I'm yours for now and for eternity.
In us I believe.
