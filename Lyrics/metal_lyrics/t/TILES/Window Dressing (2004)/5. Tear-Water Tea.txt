My heart whispers
All that reson cannot hear
Tear-water tea consoles me

Melancholy, calm &amp; still
Contemplating things that seem to me unfair
Flowers wilting in a vase
Lines that crease a child's face
Shadows dancing as candles burn in solitude

As droplets fall into the kettle it overflows
Wonder steeps in release
I drink from the cup of wisdom bittersweet
Tear-water tea restores me

Words that wound &amp; loves that kills
Can't see the forest 
For the trees distract our view
Answers written in a book ignored
Empty boats to captain through the storms
Expectations that beckon through a prison door

The journey pulls my head from the sand
As we weep with the wise
And reject laughter
Crowing from the mouths of fools
Weakened by the strain
Old habits return
Like a hand outstretched
Grasping for the stick un-fetched

As the droplets fall into the kettle it overflows
Wonder steeps in release
I drink from the cup of wisdom bittersweet
Tear-water tea restores

Simple &amp; pure
Silent recourse
Cleansing remorse reveals
Silver the lining that shines in the tin
At peace with truth
