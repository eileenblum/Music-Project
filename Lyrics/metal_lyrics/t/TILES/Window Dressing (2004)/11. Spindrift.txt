Serve the need
Spin the fable
Disguise the deed
Weaving straw to braids of gold

Splash the whitewash on the screen
Sins of omission fashioned to mislead
Signals mix as hairs poise to split
Tiny loopholes confuse intent
The facts irrelevant
Excuses right the worng
Cast illusions
And our hazy recollections
Guard the way down
On the slippery slope
Most of the truth fails to show

The shifting blame
Rises up to stake it's claim

I wade with my back towards the waves
Shielding my eyes
The spindrift burns like the acid words
Numbing my mind to be justified
Overwhelming
Can't fight the dumbing down
I sink to the peaceful deep underneath
Free from the plastic crown
Still spinning around

Dress up the orutine
Bells,whistles, &amp; neon light
Sedate the will to fight
Distractions to amuse our attention
And our gray convictions
Fan the flames of discontent
And...

I wade with my back towards the waves
Shielding my eyes
The spindrift burns like the acid words
Numbing my mind to the justified
As bitterness begins slowly creeping in

Push &amp; pull us apart
Fingers cross
Death do us part
Simplicity holds no escape
Toss a coin in the air
Spin the plates
Ignorant to consequence
Pay the piper for the dance

I see ego thrust upon the throne
Held high to deify
I see how we choose to believe
Answers that deceive &amp; ease the pain
Distant wisdom may prevail someday

Scrape the whitewash from the screen
Tiny loopholes irrelevant
Excuses meaningless
The neon is black
When our recollections
Prevent another lapse
On the slippery slope

I wade with my back towards the waves
Shielding my eyes
The spindrift burns like the acid words
Numbing my mind to the justified
Overwhelming
Can't fight the dumbing down
I sink to the peaceful deep underneath
Free from the plastic crown
Spinning around

Sow the seeds
Fearless we replay
Themes from timeless ages past
Courting all seven sins
What was &amp; will always be
Protected from ourselves
Spin back around once again
