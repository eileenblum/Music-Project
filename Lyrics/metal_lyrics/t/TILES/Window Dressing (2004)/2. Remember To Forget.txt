Here I stand unsteady
Dignity in hand
Trapped inside a vacuum
Hostage in wonderland
I try to run slipping &amp; sliding
Stumbling blindly off the cliff
What if - adrift - I can't get back
Numb I can't understand what's been done
By the other hand
This is now it's not the same
The anguish calls to stake it's claim
Sharp in relief time creeps on by

I try to make my peace
With what is &amp; what might be
Home in another time
Memories persist without rhyme
Sounds trigger thoughts trigger pain
Whispers of doubt still remain
Clinging to regret
I struggle to resist
Scars that won't forgive
Can't I remember to forget?

Paranoia building a wall
Naive misconceptions 
Feeding a future I cannot recall
Chaos as I think &amp; feel
Groping blind for the truths that I conceal
Allalone upon my throne
Intentions fail to lift the stone
Wear the badge of resentment proud

I try to make my peace
With what is &amp; what might be
Home in another time
Safe &amp; secure of some things
I could be assured

Walk the slippery slope of the past
I choose to dress up my burden
Call it salvation as it drags me down

I try to make my peace
With what is &amp; what might be
Home in another time
Memories persist without rhyme
Sounds trigger thoughts trigger pain
Whispers of doubts still remain

Shackles rust as I release the past
Free from bitterness
Without looking back I can
Remember to forget
