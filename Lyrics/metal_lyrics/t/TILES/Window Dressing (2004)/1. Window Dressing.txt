Show me what I want to see
If it keeps you safe

[Part One]

Tell me what I want to hear
And what keeps you safe
Talk tempts fate
The game is engaged
She plays with fire
Vanity sidesteps around common senses
Shrugging off conscience embracing pride
Twisted scenes bring comfort in delusion
Hide reality from the line of sight
The harvest to intrude
Fight proof
Hollow her words ringing absurd
Lies to save face compounding disgrace
Light filters through the veil exposing guilt
Clutch the straws of logic lost
Hanging on the cross

Ignorance lives in bliss with blinders on
While it shows denial is en vogue
Age-old wisdom's whisper dies from neglect
Our egos to protect

Now that I know
How little we know
About each other
Tracing an image of a portrait
That we wish was true
But the colors run
Faces I see
Tell little about What to believe
Layers of window dressing
Barely hint at what's beneath
Covered up like paint on rust
Who to trust?

[Part Two]

If I can still recall
Simplicity seemed like nothing at all
Summertime days to spend without end
Hazy warm faint scent of pine gracing the air
We let our whims take us away
Not to return as Eden drew to a close

Careless deeds strip my faith
Heart on ice I retreat
I wish true were false &amp; fiction were real
Bit by bit the mirage fades from view
Never taught finally learned
The corner turned
Wish I may wish I might
Forget illusion's charm

Now that I know
How little we know
About each other
Tracing an image of a portrait
That we wish was true
Fashion covers all we hope to hide
Faces I see
Tell little about
What to believe
Layes of window dressing
Barely hint at what's beneath
Now that I know
How nothing we show
Really matters

Optimistic-pessimistic
Expectation to blame

[Part Three]

So much happens that we can't perceive
Safe in a cloak of ignorance
With passing time childish notions finally die
When the pain we endure
Compounds with consciousness
Delusions to protect &amp; survive

Reflecting on what I know I will never know
Curtains drawn concealing the light of truth
