All she knows
Is what she's told
Is fact &amp; fantasy
Life in harminy

She stands alone
Shadow on the wall
Gently lit her silhoutte
Reflecting tall
She spins to look
On my command
The shutter clicks she blinks
And laughs offhand

I slow the pace
And pause to stop &amp; think
Here is a moment
Where good fortune winks

Eyes that sparkle
And eyes that shine
Hazel eyes smile
As they peer into mine
Canvas blank
The slate is clean
With nothing in between us
Simple &amp; untarnished
She is all she seems

All she knows 
Will turn to gold
Colors spill in waves
Off the path she paves

She dreams a place
Chapters in a book
Stories long with heroes strong
How blue the sky would look
Then she stops to see
Who's listening
Seeds of consciousness
Come creeping in

All I know
Here is a moment
Where good fortune winks

Someday when she feels the comfort fade
Holding on to this humble place
