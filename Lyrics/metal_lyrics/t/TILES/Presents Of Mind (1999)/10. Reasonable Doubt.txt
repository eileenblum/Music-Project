I sit looking through a cage
Feel the tension and the rage
Events evolving without a reason
Just a pawn, this political season

No hope while efforts fail
Fact and fiction on my trail
I'm a scapegoat for authority
Can't stop this tale of hypocrisy

I was told the past is a reflection of the future

Life spent in vain seeking revenge
A reason to doubt
Justice abstained to the bitter end
Proof dismissed as too far out
There was a reason to doubt
But we're too busy with the words
That people spoke yet no one heard
When are we ever going to learn?

I sit trembling in the chair
I feel the hatred behind the stares
The surge electric builds and snaps my nerves
Lifeless innocence whose justice was served?

I know the truth slips through the hands of random judgement

Life spent in vain seeking revenge
A reason to doubt
Justice abstained to the bitter end
Proof dismissed as too far out
There was a reason to doubt
But we're too busy with the words
That people spoke yet no one heard
When are we ever going to learn?

Life spent in vain seeking revenge
A reason to doubt
Justice abstained to the bitter end
Proof dismissed as too far out
There was a reason to doubt
But we're too busy with the words
That people spoke yet no one heard
When are we ever going to learn?

There was a reason to doubt
It wasn't convenient
There was a reason to doubt
No one chose to believe
There was a reason to doubt
Who is deceived?
But we're too busy with the words
That people spoke yet no one heard
When are we ever going to learn?

There was a reason to doubt
Truth was the answer that didn't count
Won't someone please let me out?
