I can't find an open door
Recall what I was looking for
Waste from haste we fail to see
Stop to think reluctantly

Now? When? Here? Then?
Demoralized, compromised
Check integrity at the door
Cutting throats, dashing hopes
Face down upon the floor

Our goal, to be the best
To find a way to belong
Help the ones who need
To mold their destiny
But good intentions don't always
Work the way they should
Some end up harming more
Than doing any good

We can't take all the blame
For everything gone wrong
When will others have the right
To find a way with their own insight?

What? When? If? Then?
Bottom lines with token fines
Slim chance to get caught
Example set by hedging bets
Means to and end are bought

Our goal, to be the best
To find a way to belong
To help the ones who need
To mold their destiny
But good intentions don't always
Work the way they should
Some end up harming more
Than doing any good

Our goal, to be the best
To find a way to belong
To help the ones who need
To mold their destiny
But good intentions don't always
Work the way they should
Some end up harming more
Than doing any good
