Show us a change or maybe a move
But don't be surpised if it can't be proved
We help reinforce the things that you do
Your behavior will be changed as we apply the screw
Equality to all is advocated here
But you're not by yourself, there's nothing to fear

To modify
There's clarify
Conditioning we theorize
Systematic planning
Has advantages to modify

The more you've sold the more you will get
Your motivation's improved, but it's not quite there yet
What shall we do to keep you here?
What to say

What to say just isn't clear
Coerce and force hasn't worked
Our objectives were wrong
Instead of helping we hurt
