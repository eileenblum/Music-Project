Years of sameness make us this way
Taking the blame's no longer o.k.
Over again some never stray
Tortured and bland walk hand in hand

Routines are all right, we all need some
To never fight means everything's right?
Passive and willing, agree with anything
Draw the line, develop a spine

Static is our legacy
Taught from birth what we believe
Our mind creates another boundary
Watching the moments pass
Our purpose cannot last
Trapped in a re-run
Going nowhere fast

I stand in line for a long time
Who says I have to, who made this rule?
Speaking to myself isn't going to help
Do something dynamic, why withstand it?

History repeats too frequently
No one ever learns to react positively
Whatever exists, we all pay the fees
Charging ahead, regardless of need

Static is our legacy
Taught from birth what we believe
Our mind creates another boundary
Watching the moments pass
Our purpose cannot last
Trapped in a re-run
Going nowhere

Static is our legacy
Taught from birth what we believe
Our mind creates another boundary
Watching the moments pass
Our purpose cannot last
Trapped in a re-run
Going nowhere
Chipping away our pride
Static is the means to hide
Avoiding risk, ignoring all replies
It is our legacy
Taught from birth what we believe
Our minds create another boundary
