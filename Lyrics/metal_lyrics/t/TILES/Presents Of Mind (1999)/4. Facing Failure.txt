Thread the eye
Led by an ill frame of mind
Judge to justify
End results sometimes lie friends and peers
Motives unclear - disappear
Facing fear and doubt
Hear the whisper explode into a shout

Too late to get out

Words stinging twisting turning
Echo in my head
I can't afford the cost of wasted time
No failure
Trapped in a spiral without an end
Around another corner
Turning blind

Tensions crest
Dunce cap crowns the litmus test
Smoking guns report
Can't leave the line to start as scars return
Nothing learned, hopeless and burned
Raging on and on
War of words fought yet again are seldom won

Too late to belong

Words stinging twisting turning
Echo in my head
I can't afford the cost of wasted time
No failure
Trapped in a spiral without an end
Around another corner
Turning blind

Asking, answering, looking, seeing
Take refuge from the storm
Seeking, finding, directions clearer
Truth takes many forms

Words stinging twisting turning
Echo in my head
I can't afford the cost of wasted time
No failure
Trapped in a spiral without an end
Around another corner
Turning blind
