At the end of the day
Nerves are worn, a little frayed
Move to wash up after toil
Look to see the sweat and soil
Passion for existence
Can't be bought, can't be sold
Altering conditions to pave the way
Caution on hold

Caught in a rut of safe procedures
Realize that change is always a feature

So you've done what you're told
Following the rule of gold
Rescued from obscurity
By a sense of destiny
When the cast peels away
Clearing fog reveals the day
Thoughts and plans and dreams take shape
As new fears wait to awake

Caught in a rut of safe procedures
Realize that change is always a feature
