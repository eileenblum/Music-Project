Prone beneath the friendly fire
Floorboards creak toward collapse
I close my eyes wishing for a pair of wings
Opening

Spirits lifting over looming cliffs
Smiling faces
Meet me in the sky

What goes up, it must come down
Falling through the pages of the past

Weightless,
Out of body, out of mind
I'm escaping gravity
Sailing weightlessness
Take me far away from here
Above the burning pantomime

Putting trust in broken promises
Flying colours, flying blind
Hard to let go
Hard to get out
Cherished my illusions to survive
Hard to get over shadows of doubt

[2x]
Weightless,
Out of body, out of mind
I'm escaping gravity
Sailing weightlessness
Take me far away from here
Above the burning pantomime

Knowing winds of change will never die
