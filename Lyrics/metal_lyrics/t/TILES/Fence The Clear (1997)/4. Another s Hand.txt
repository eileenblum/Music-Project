Bullets split the air
Sounds of destruction and despair
Break the silence - sense the fear
No place to run, no shouts to hear

Creep through the silence
Crouched on his knees
Lurk in the corners
Fault what he sees
Lost in the timeless
Age of vengeance past
Force justice blindly
Another's hand is cast

Signs of life are gone
No trace of fate to linger on
Lost perspective - hopeless rage
Live for the thrill of a war engaged

Creep through the silence
Crouched on his knees
Lurk in the corners
Fault what he sees
Lost in the timeless
Age of vengeance past
Force justice blindly
Another's hand is cast

Creep through the silence
Crouched on his knees
Lurk in the corners
Fault what he sees
Lost in the timeless
Age of vengeance past
Force justice blindly
Another's hand is cast
