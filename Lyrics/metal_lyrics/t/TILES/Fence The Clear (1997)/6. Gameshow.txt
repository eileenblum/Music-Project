In the eye of the public open and wide
Staring at the screen we see the public is not shy
Day in and out it's your entertainment
Watching in dismay at the antics of contestants

On each station - all the same as before
This quest for fortune - not to be ignored
The gameshow host - he's a wonderful guy
Smiles as he hands to you - hands you the prize

Daily tasks set aside for stimulation
Now lost in the fantasy of a new excursion
Shouting out all the answers whether right or wrong
Win again in the safety of our lonely homes

On each station - all the same as before
This quest for fortune - not to be ignored
The gameshow host - he's a wonderful guy
Smiles as he hands to you - hands you the prize
