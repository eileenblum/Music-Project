Catching a sign beyond the window
I cannot see into reality
The things I'm told - they cannot be

This world is not perfect
Politicians voting for bureaucracy
With no regard for you or me

Who can sense what lies beyond
What hides beneath the surface?
Our faces frozen into stone
While lying dormant it's concealed
In our subconscious
The sleeping giant of unknowns

Stars and stripes expand horizons
Everybody needs to have a stronger voice
There is no color, there is no choice

Some think they're our saviors
Playing us like ivory pieces on a board
There is no loss they can't afford

Who can sense what lies beyond
What hides beneath the surface?
Our faces frozen into stone
While lying dormant it's concealed
In our subconscious
The sleeping giant of unknowns

There is no want for views
To flood our minds
Rhetoric means nothing
Holding onto empty words
When the vision is blind

Who can sense what lies beyond
What hides beneath the surface?
Our faces frozen into stone
While lying dormant it's concealed
In our subconscious
The sleeping giant of unknowns
Beneath the surface
Beneath the surface are unknowns
Beneath the surface
Beneath the surface nothing shows
Beneath the surface
Beneath the surface
Beneath the surface
Beneath the surface are unknown
