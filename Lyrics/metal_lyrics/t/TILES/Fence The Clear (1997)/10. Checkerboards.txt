The purpose has meaning
But the meaning is we're bleeding
Moving the checkers on the board
Chasing our selfish benefit
In the hallowed halls of avarice
King us on the checkerboard
Scattering checkers on the floor

Thinking in the past
Of all the things which didn't last
Dispel the stress of compromise
Uncertain aims were no surprise
As the path played out ahead
And condescending words were said
I know the will was mine
A future dreamt within my mind

The purpose has meaning

Can we define what's right
Fighting ourselves with all our might
Thoughts and strategies are terms
To reject upon the urge
Can't deflect impending shame
By passing on your shame of the blame
Weapons rust in the rain
The same mistakes will strike again

I am sitting in the crowd
Unresponsive to the voices that I hear
Shouting out can't catch my ear
I am thinking with furrowed brow

Ignoring forces hoping to take hold of me
When will this distance set me free?
I am sorry once again

Uncommon sense just out of reach

Social structure with order
Socially separate we discover
Traits of distinction denied
Mistaking our heritage for pride
Disruptions fuel the motion
Conflict feeds our institutions
Right and wrong defy description
Freedom without restitution
Is all life based on illusion?

Left is right?
But right is wrong?
Peers dictating who belongs
Thrill to the kill
As we kill what we fear
What we don't understand
And what isn't clear

The purpose has meaning
But the meaning is we're bleeding
Moving the checkers on the board
Chasing our selfish benefit
In the hallowed halls of avarice
King us on the checkerboard
We don't know we're losing
Euphoric we're choosing
Falling off the checkerboard
