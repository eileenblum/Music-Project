Languishing with heavy heart
At the sight of pain and fear
Contorted movements cease
Standing alone in the clear
Withdrawn and motionless
The agony ends in peace
Staring eyes reflect disbelief

Seconds slowly tick away
Touched off by accident
Confused and unprepared
Losing the fight against fear
Passing slowly on no saving grace to prevail
Another painful lesson failed

Move beyond the clear
Pass the barriers implied
Understand the reasons why
Hear the requiem
The weight of burdens undenied
Remove the doubt, reject the lies
Changing the guard
Hold the moment, heal the scars
Changing the guard, hear the requiem
Lay the guilt to rest

Moments in reflection blur
As the replay rolls again
Vivid thoughts grow dim
Remnents of blame to defend
Shedding tears of grief
No explanation consoles
The sun shines on the passing soul

Move beyond the clear
Pass the barriers implied
Understand the reasons why
Hear the requiem
The weight of burdens undenied
Remove the doubt, reject the lies
Changing the guard
Hold the moment, heal the scars
Changing the guard, hear the requiem
Lay the guilt to rest

Move beyond the clear
Pass the barriers implied
Understand the reasons why
Hear the requiem
The weight of burdens undenied
Remove the doubt, reject the lies
Changing the guard
Hold the moment, heal the scars
Changing the guard, hear the requiem
Lay the guilt to rest

Changing the guard
Changing the guard
Changing the guard
Changing the guard
Hold the moment, heal the scars
Changing the guard
Hear the requiem
Lay the guilt
To rest
