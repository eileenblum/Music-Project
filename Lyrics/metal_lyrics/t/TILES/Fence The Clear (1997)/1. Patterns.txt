Take the chance to break away
This doesn't happen every day
The future's too unsure

Take the time to check the tab
Reality is not that bad
Truth need to be exposed

Sometimes it's easier
To copy history
It's tough adapting when there is no cure

Patterns are the maps you draw
Patterns don't take very long
Patterns weather ups and downs
Keep your feet flat on the ground

Know when it's time to cut
It doesn't mean you're giving up
Don't ever leave unless you're thinking

It's always easier
To cling to history
Sometimes your instincts know which way to go

Patterns are the maps you draw
Patterns don't take very long
Patterns weather ups and downs
Keep your feet flat on the ground
Patterns are the maps you draw
Patterns don't take very long
Patterns weather ups and downs
Keep your feet flat on the ground

Don't get too upset
No one wants all they get
Are we really comfortable?

Patterns are the maps you draw
Patterns don't take very long
Patterns weather up sand downs
Keep your feet flat on the ground
Patterns are the maps you draw
Patterns don't take very long
Patterns weather ups and downs
Keep your feet flat on the ground
