We were watching as the buildings fell
And the ground folded
Minutes passed and the destruction was over
Dust and rubble fill the stagnant air
Blotting out the sun
The beauty lost in moments as the wars begun

Something isn't right
There's always more to any fight
Losers pay with life and limb
Is this the price when others win?
Pages show the human plight
Ignores the past for present sight
No one sees the other side
Trapped within the hopeless lies
Drowning in the wading pool

We were watching as the waters flowed
And the sky darkened
Hours passed as the plains turned to oceans
Sound and fury thundered in the air
Can't tell day from night
Wallowing in pity at our lack of insight

Something isn't right
There's always more to any fight
Losers pay with life and limb
Is this the price when others win?
Pages show the human plight
Ignores the past for present sight
No one sees the other side
Trapped within the hopeless lies
Drowning in the wading pool
Drowning in the wading pool

Something isn't right

Ignores the past for present sight
No one sees the other side
Trapped within the hopeless lies
Drowning in the wading
Drowning in the wading
Drowning in the wading pool
