A line of clouds forms in the sky
A hazy heat builds slowly

The sun appears beyond the point
A barren stretch awakens
Cracked but seamless to the horizon
Idle landscape, no distractions

Dust and 'weeds drift in the distance
An image flickers by

I see the colors unfolding before me
There's a presence in this unrelenting force
Wind and water work in tandem
Claim the living - unforgiving 'til the end
Can't stop this natural course

The moon will light the changing scenes
A silent contrast to the efforts never seen
Burrows fill as life retreats
A constant battle to defeat the path serene

Cactus valley

The ground hardens worn but sharp
Stifling heatwave focused
Idle creatures scan dominions
Balance failures lost

I see the colors unfolding before me
There's a presence in this unrelenting force
Wind and water work in tandem
Claim the living - unforgiving 'til the end
Can't stop this natural course

The moon will light the changing scenes
A silent contrast to the efforts never seen
Burrows fill as life retreats
A constant battle to defeat the path serene

Cactus valley
Cactus valley
