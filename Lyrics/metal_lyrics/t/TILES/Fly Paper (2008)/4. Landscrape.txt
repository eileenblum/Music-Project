Standing there abandoned
And in disrepair
Stranded in a question
Frozen in the air
Left behind to find
That there is no one left to care
Unsuspecting unaware

Landscrape
Skeletons awake to play
Secret life in sins implied
Chasing time for ties that blind
Buried by the Landscrape
Landscrape
Looking in the wrong place

Sleeping deep inside
I'm drifting through the weeds
Sweeping up the ashes
Of these broken dreams
Looking to the past
To glance at all that might have been
In between the unseen sins

I'm believing &amp; deceiving myself
I can't keep carrying memories around
