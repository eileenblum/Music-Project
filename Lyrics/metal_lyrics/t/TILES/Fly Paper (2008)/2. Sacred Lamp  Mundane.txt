Evaporate
Drop by drop
Sinking inch by inch
Feel the ebb and flow
As momentum slows

Accumulate
One by one
Changing bit by bit
Ivory tower test
Entertains the guest

Hidden in the space between the words
Another dialect to learn
An ounce prevents a pound of cure
Sacred and mundane

Articulate
Word by word
Standing face to face
Bridges burning still
In a test of wills

Manipulate
Step by step
Twisting day by day
Addicted to the fight
Words as sharp as knives

I see blue washing into orange and red
Fanning sparks to flame
Details multiply
Never twice the same

Assimilate
Choice by choice
Shrinking lie by lie
False identity
Keeping you from me
