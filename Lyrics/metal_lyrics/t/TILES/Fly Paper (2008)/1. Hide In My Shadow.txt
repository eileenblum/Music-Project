I feel a presence
I catch your movement
In the corner of my eye

Keeping its distance
Features hidden
With passing time

Exerting tension
I still grate against the pull
Keeping pace with me
More than company to see

Hide in my shadow
Deep within my wounds
Hide in my shadow
Brick by brick
I build my tomb

Exerting tension
I will grate against the pull
While this dissention speaks
And plays the fool

Every Fall the fear is always there
I like to visit my despair
Silent but not gone
