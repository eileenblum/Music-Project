I can't see inside the present
Staring down the road reflected in the sun
More said than done
I'm immersed in introspection
Setting stones of speculation one by one

Longing for something more
Tomorrow cannot come
While I wish my time away

Safe in my comfort zone
Ignoring cold reality
I can feel the strings attaching
Stumbling blocks overturning under me

Scraping toward
Faint rewards
Fabricating milestones

Living in
Stately whims
At a place beyond my reach

Wanting - searching
Scanning - yearning
Markers guiding me

Skating past
Liquid glass
On my way to something else

I forget
What I get
Before it's what I've got

Planning - tracking
Clipping - posting
Markers sticking to me

Scraping toward
Faint rewards
Skating past
Liquid glass
Cue cards show
All I know
Markers pulling me
