Something else to occupy
Something else to drain your energy
Something more weighs on your mind
Something more that's keeping you from me
All these things to make me bleed

Tangled up in the weeds
Playing hide and seek

As you fade from my view
Where are you?
You're not here when you should care
Reaching out for your hand
But it's not there
Hide and seek
You're not here

Somewhere else is beckoning
Somewhere else is hidden in plain sight
Somewhere else is my retreat
Somewhere else is shelter deep inside

Floating on the sea
Random currents moving me
If I don't care
I will go somewhere
Rain in the morning light
Dreamt a lifetime in a single night

Weathered and worn
Creased and torn
Creased and torn
Understanding comes too late
