I shut out myself
And the world
You ignore the past
Say it won't last

Some mistakes will not erase
Coloring all that I do and say
Empty heart and crowded mind
Won't make it right

I hang by a thread
Upside down
We step off a ledge
Onto the edge

I lift my head
I clear my thoughts
And listen for words of saving grace
I'm letting go of all the skeletons I chase

We can co-exist
Living in the Crowded Emptiness
