The rising stars from a shadow land
Remove my hate for the angry men
They know what is right they know what is wrong
Deep down inside they will bind your render

Silence insane with anger
Falls from the sky to the end...

Creator in time
Like whispering faces the search will go on
The unbroken spirit

The heavy wings from the fairytale
Will fly you all to the evil way
They know what to do they know what to see
The only way is to spread your miracle

Silence insane with anger
Falls from the sky to the end...

Creator in time
Like whispering faces the search will go on
The guest for the cradle
Assembling the brave ones
With spirits no fear
Creator in time

Creator in time
Creator in time
