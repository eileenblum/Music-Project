Ever since the day you left me I've wasted all alone
I hear the songs of yesterday it's everywhere

No one knows the reason why it's time to carry on
And sometimes it hurts in my soul

By the end of broken dreams I've travelled on my own
I've seen the castles of this place growing too strong

Now my time is closing in like million miles away
It seems like I'm lost in the night

The ashen soul bursts into secrets like no one has seen before
Like magic songs they can breathe the sounds and render

Not far away deep down as plain as the sun in the sky
On the edge, where to fall
Spinning on the curves of life like diamonds in the night

Like the answer is fading down the stars of universe

Let's find the soul I will be searching for evil and
Stop towards him that's for sure
Speeding down the anger from the fairies in the night

The ashen soul...

Not far away deep down as plain as the sun in the sky
On the edge, where to fall
Spinning on the curves of life like diamonds in the night

Like the answer...

By the end of broken dreams I've travelled on my own
I've seen the castles of this place growing too strong

Now my time is closing in like million miles away
It seems like I'm lost in the night
