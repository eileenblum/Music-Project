I'm waiting for the time to see
Spinning on the signs of rage
Locked forever now it is eternity

Creation of reflected souls
Your mind becomes another way
Just so see what is going on

When the night is here lost in pain
Why not say goodbye with trust they will
Fade away

Infected flames will paint the sky
Colours from the universe
Merge down the burning red

Forever strong hold on to strength
Break down the evil light and turn
Back to the place where the fire burns

Surrender contended can take the warning light away
Creating flames from the end

Sphere of my fantasy
Still rises in the blood red sky
Now is the time to say no

Not meant to be for real
Even if sacredness is gone
Lost in the night for ever

It's time to go like far away
Staying here is dangerous
Can not wait it's time to carry on

Into the gates of war they'll lead the way
Find all your sacred dreams and go
Straight to the sphere of your fantasy

When the night is here lost in pain
Why not say goodbye with trust they will
Fade away

Surrender contended can take the warning light away
Creating flames from the end

Invaded created to be the master of the world
Deception that's what it is

Sphere of my fantasy
Still rises in the blood red sky
Now is the time to say no

Not meant to be for real
Even if sacredness is gone
Lost in the night for ever

When the night is here lost in pain
Why not say goodbye with trust they will
Fade away

Sphere of my fantasy
Still rises in the blood red sky
Now is the time to say no

Not meant to be for real
Even if sacredness is gone
Lost in the night for ever
