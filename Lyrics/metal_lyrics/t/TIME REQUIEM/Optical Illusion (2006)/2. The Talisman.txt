My soul is to remind you
Your soul is lost in the night
Somehow it burns out my fantasies

Lights out the blackness will call me
Dark wings are fading away
Then feel the restless call in the sky

The face of universe has broken down forever gone
It's time to show yourself not fade away and die

Your eyes and all the stars can render all the sacred hearts
The answer's locked inside us all

Lay down knees shall be grounded
Smiling mock to the crowd
Cruel wind strikes all my sacred dreams

Inside deep down infested
Shades out look for the sign
Somehow it burns out my fantasies

The face of universe has broken down forever gone
It's time to show yourself not fade away and die

Your eyes and all the stars can render all the sacred hearts
The answer's locked inside us all

The face of universe has broken down forever gone
It's time to show yourself not fade away and die

Your eyes and all the stars can render all the sacred hearts
The answer's locked inside us all
