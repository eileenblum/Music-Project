Waiting in the shadows they've filled my fantasies
Spinning in a circle destroying what I've seen
No matter when I walk in like phantoms wearing crowns
I must sacrifice like angels from the past

My hands are facing universe

Fading in a mission like so many times before
Standing in the moonlight I've travelled on my own
Running round in circles can't testify my guilt
You must tell the crowd course no one's seen the way

My hands are facing universe
You find your freedom in the sign

I'm running just like the miracle man
Yes I'm running far from the miracle man

Waiting in the shadows they've filled my fantasies
Spinning in a circle destroying what I've seen
No matter when I walk in like phantoms wearing crowns
I must sacrifice like angels from the past

My hands are facing universe
You find your freedom in the sign

I'm running...
I'm running...
I'm running...
I'm running...

Yes I'm running far from the miracle man
Yes I'm running far from the miracle man

Oh yeah! Just like a miracle, a miracle man
Miracle man
