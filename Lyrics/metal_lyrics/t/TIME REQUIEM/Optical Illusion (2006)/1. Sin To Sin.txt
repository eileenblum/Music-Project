Why can't you see to
The glory of
Spirits on the way to make me understand your soul
It's fading down my assertiveness no not once again

You've done this like million times before
Well I don't know if I can take it on my own
Splinters on this way can never find the things you're said
They are gone like spoken words
The anger has rusting the key

Love will consume within my wisdom
Taste the bitter-sweet
Slave for the unknown snatching winds of war

Why can't you see to
The glory of
Spirits on the way to make me understand your soul
It's fading down my assertiveness no not once again

Love will consume within my wisdom
Taste the bitter-sweet
Slave for the unknown snatching winds of war

Love will consume within my wisdom
Taste the bitter-sweet
Slave for the unknown snatching winds of war

Love will consume within my wisdom
You know it to well
Slave for the unknown snatching winds of war
