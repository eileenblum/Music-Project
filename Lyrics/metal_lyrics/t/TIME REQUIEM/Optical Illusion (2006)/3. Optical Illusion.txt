You came across and everything became a dream
That made me crying with tears around

And ever since the day you left the spirit walking
Here alone, here alone

It's in the rainbow like rivers in the end
Fight and breathe away it's all in your sin

Can't you see
It's gone for ever more
Return your fantasies

When you surrender to the morning light
When you will end up with the warning light
Oh there is no way to deny it
To the bitter end we will find

It's in the rainbow like rivers in the end
Fight and breathe away it's all in your sin

Can't you see
It's gone for ever more
Return your fantasies

When you surrender to the morning light
When you will end up with the warning light
Oh there is no way to deny it
To the bitter end we will find
