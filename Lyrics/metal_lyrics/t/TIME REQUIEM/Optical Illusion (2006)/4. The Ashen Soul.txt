Waiting fading I'm touching all the stars across the sky
Feel my pain

Breaking taking to catching all the rumours of the world
The mystery...

No others game
I'm dressed up in blackness I'm cutting all the curves
It's just for real it's beating down my soul

No, there's no way out of here
You... stranded in time of love

Taking snapshots in the night
The beautiful has been seen all over so
Stay down lay down oh no

Breeding feeding from the body you've been given from
The ashen soul

Talk to walk through spitting on the faces left behind
It's all you need...

That's for sure
They want you to lay down with faces to the earth
But that's the way you better hold on tight...

No, there's no way out of here
You... stranded in time of love

No, there's no way out of here
It's gone...
