It's lost in the sky with no reason why I don't know what it is
bring out the souls tol carry me home, They will be your saint of love.

Need all to see with conception now I've tried to carry on
Might be same as you will deny the game we'd tried so hard to see

No! With seven miles from home
I can't deny what's going on to me.

The master will say that you have to pray with spirits in the night
Sacral and signs will carry you on, crowns will the sacred lies.

The rest of the world will surrender now it's time for you to go
Question your soul and you will be there, I will show your way to sin.


No! With seven miles from home
I can't deny what's going on to me.
The gift is gone.

Can you remember all the wars
with fading spirits having more
of roses in the sky
the eyes will ignore
Days of eternity.

Surrender surrender to carry on
Surrender i`ve got days upon my mind
Surrender I can't let go
gaze into reality.

I will be the saint og sadness carry on your burden into future of tomorrow
When the sadness tries to reach you, lock up your chains ,try to remain
Watching all the stars above , with glories and passion for the unforgiving
ages of danger.

We might believe that someone will see the danger in our sin
Pay with your mind and anger will be find spells with hate and fury...oh!

Passed on to see what's inside the doom of horror pricw and blood
Say all the words and you will be there, casting down the kings of mud.
