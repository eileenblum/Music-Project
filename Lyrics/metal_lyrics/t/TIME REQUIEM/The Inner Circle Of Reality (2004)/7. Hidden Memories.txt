Run into this game of fantasy
Lost in the shadows of love and pain
eyes are fading and the wings are week (weak)
Try to remain on your way
Carved in stones with your own blood and tears
Won't stand in shadows of love and war
Sings of sadness show the way with words
They will be lost in the night.

Sometimes it feels like I'm standing in your dreams
Days in heaven will be stronger day by day.

Sanctuary is my penalty in this brave new world, I will testify
For no reason why you will sacrifice with your own dimension of sorrow.

Some one in this place will take you down
Measure the guilt with your own despair
Like the angels of my dreams come true
They will be closer to you.

Sometimes it feels like I'm standing in your dreams
Days in heaven will be stronger day by day.

Sanctuary is my penalty in this brave new world, I will testify
For no reason why you will sacrifice with your own dimension of sorrow.

I will lose control
I will say no more just be strong, and hold to
the vision of goodness
The ancient dreams like my memories
have the force to be like
a warrior.

Sanctuary is my penalty in this brave new world, I will testify
For no reason why you will sacrifice with your own dimension of sorrow.
