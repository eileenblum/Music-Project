I've seen an angel who leads me
to a place inside your dreams
As when the wind blows I will testify
For the victims that I've seen
And for the stairway they all have gone
to see what's on the way
Like for the endless I will seize them all
and return a million souls.

It's all for real and that's for sure
As night and day go to the end
Form grace to war your life will be
a place where you will remember.

It's all for real and you will see
The pain and grief asking for more
Salvation of a million souls
That ask for more from your fire.
