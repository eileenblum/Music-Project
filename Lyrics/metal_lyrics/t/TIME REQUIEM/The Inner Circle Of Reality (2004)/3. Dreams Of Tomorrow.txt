I keep on with dreams of tomorrow - feel that I'm wasting all my life
I amjust filled with deception of love

No it's for real I can't live the lies - Scenes will always be there
Cradles of love will picture m way - just the way.

All the time the deep chains of sorrow pushed myself stronger and more
As the end always will be here for real.

Far from the saints angels and death ,life will always be there
I can let you go I must be aware that it's the end.

I keep on with songs of tomorrow even though silence is for real
Must be brave living the ultimate sin as the time changes the endless
you will see the future in your hands, can't go on liging this way all my
life.

Wasting my soul when the moon and the sun are for real
Rising danger in this way can be lost in the castle of hell.

Feel the pain of sacrifice waiting on the edge so long, like fire in the sky
deja vu dreams come true, even though you might be waiting all alone.

At the end the ghosts and the shadows
passing through like razors in the wind
Might be wrong living the ultimate sin
In the night when demons and danger
hunt your mind like angels in a dream
Cast the spell far from the new way of love.

Feel the pain of sacrifice waiting on the edge so long, like fire in the sky
Let my soul of destiny I pay the pricw when full moon's rising.

On the edge I`ll die.
