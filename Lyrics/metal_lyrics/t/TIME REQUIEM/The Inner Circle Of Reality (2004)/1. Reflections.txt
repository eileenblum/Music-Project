Now you're gone and I`ve received your soul
will you be mine for real
As the night silence from the river
behold the signs and die

Spoken words of sacredness as you

Run for truth and find the key that will be blessed by
moments of forever
you will not surrender
sail across the oceans
always bring your sword

End of light the shades will always turn to
the ancient songs of life
Hypnotized and steel will make my promise
embrace the son and lie

Spoken words of sacredness as you

Run for truth and find the key that will be blessed by
moments of forever
you will not surrender
sail across the oceans
always bring your sword

Run for truth and find the key that will be blessed by
moments of forever
you will not surrender
Sail across the oceans
always bring your sword
raise the price of God.
