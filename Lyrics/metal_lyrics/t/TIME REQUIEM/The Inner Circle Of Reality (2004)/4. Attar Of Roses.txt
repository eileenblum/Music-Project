Deception like warriors
will raise all the anger
The search for the holy grail
and masters will see
The eyes of the ancient
will leave all the rage for
demons, dragons and swords
they will fight the end.

The sunrise will show that spirits will be
The unbroken lord is closing the end.

Live the sin read the signs across the sky
Moment of truth is rising
Live and win de the everlasting game
Maintain the strength into eternity.

On wings they will take you
to places of danger
No way to the sadred land
you're last on the earth
for life you will tell them
to lay down and cry
in anger stress and in pain
you will see the light.

The sunrise will show that spirits will be
The unbroken lord is closing the end.
