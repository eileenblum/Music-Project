Meant to be a warrior
freezing all the spirits of life
Last to see the walking heroes fading in the night
I will not ever leave you a shadow of fear
Still believe in anger and in pain I've seen light.

This is not how to make a thunder
Can be lost in the sky
I can't believe what it feels like under
it is lost in my way.

Asking you to send me pieces
of your silver and gold
Capturing your emptiness
your battle and your war.

I will live forever ever and more
you cannot be the one
Asking me these questions
that will ake you to my grave.

This is not how to make a thunder
Can be lost in the sky
I can't believe what it feels like under
it is lost in my way.

To many people the place is burning
When you dazzle the floor
Around a piece made of gold and silver
Can I ask you why?

Sacredness is bridges to the night
No emptiness will ever be the same
Shadows from a war
Shadows from my war.

Now I have the power to be cruel
and make justice right
Ever since the fire rises ind the crimson sky
Captured be the moonlight
still I believe there is something to see
I will be the last one hear for real
when you are one.

This is not how to make a thunder
Can be lost in the sky
I can't believe what it feels like under
it is lost in my way.
