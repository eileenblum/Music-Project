How easy it would be to show me how you feel
Words are not enough for me no more
Remember saying I will lead you on the way
Morning came along is the for real?

I gave you all my love to cherish and to hold
Against your heart to the one is this for real
Wise men say: The only victim of your life
will never be for real in silence.

Aching my head is taking you to my everlasting war
you might be the victim of my life
Morning can hear your warning
before the curtains of the night
Closing in on earth with strongest hands.

This is my everlasting game
I never saw what's meant to be.

Wasting me blood is tasting
you haven`t seen th judgment day
Chosen friends will soon forsake you down
Savior your own behavior can be
the last thing of your life
Take this paid advice course it's for real.

This is my everlasting game
I never saw what's meant to be.

I wish my God will take to eternity
Fading spirits sent from Judas' son
It's for real like a demon in the sky
Passing through I'm asking why
You will burn into my hell.

Trading you might be fading
along with shadow in the air
Now you have to sacrifice my love
Reaching you'll soon be preaching
about this crime and penalty
You might be the last one here for real.

This is my everlasting game
I never saw what's meant to be.

I wish me God will take me to eternity
Fading spirits sent from Judas' son
It's for real like a demon in the sky
Passing through I'm asking why
You will burn into my hell.

I wish me God will take me to eternity
Fading spirits sent from Judas' son
It's for real like a demon in the sky
Passing through I'm asking why
You will burn into my hell.

Like a demon in the sky
Passing trough I'm asking why
You will burn into my hell.

God take me to eternity
Spirits sent from bravery
Like a demon in the sky.
