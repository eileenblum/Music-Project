A shadow in the night can be a demon
with the power of God
Before you will survive
you must be aware about a thing
and what you see.

It's in the air right now
I am the risen I`m the chosen one to see
This bloody war is here to stay.

Now he cast down
the pieces of silver and gold
in the temple light.

Betrayyourself and die
this is a war without a soul and without tears
Can you be strong enough to see
the fire you believe in every day.

My enemy is here to bring the spirit
or no reason back to hell
Your sacrifice will be the way.

I make confession without words
praying in the night for the seventh sign.

When the savior s diving in the night
Soldiers gathered  screaming out your name
Powers from the glory shiny grace
Masters using pieses of my mind.

If you believe in this
you might imagine they are putting this together
I will be there to see the cradle
fading in the night not far away.

It's in the air right now
I am the risen I`m the chosen one to see
This bloody war is here to stay.

Now he cast down
the pieces of silver and gold
in the temple light.

When the savior s diving in the night
Soldiers gathered  screaming out your name
Powers from the glory shiny grace
Masters using pieses of my mind.
