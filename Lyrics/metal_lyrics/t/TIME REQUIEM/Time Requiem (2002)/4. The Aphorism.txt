Welcome to my war the everlasting game
Shadows from a grave like eternity
You must sacrifice no mercy will be shown
Cast your soul and come to die.

Satan is for real I've looked him in his eyes
All I saw was guilt filled with blood
Fields of spoken words are lying on the ground
Evil crown of thorn will be.

The face of universe will be the sanctuary
Your dreams of destiny can take you there to see
Where all the saviors of the world were meant to be
They rise beyond the power
you will have to sacrifice your love..
You'd better come and rescue me.

This is not for real it's only your dream
You will have the force just to take it down
The sword is in  your hand
your mind is filled with hate
Take this greif and crucify.

Now you must be strong like warriors without fear
Perish from the earth is a quality
Many years ago when silence was for real
Descent from the cross of life.

The face of universe will be the sanctuary
Your dreams of destiny can take you there to see
Where all the saviors of the world were meant to be
They rise beyond the power
you will have to sacrifice your love...
You'd better come and rescue me.

The face of universe will be the sanctuary
Your dreams of destiny can take you there to see
Where all the saviors of the world were meant to be
They rise beyond the power
you will have to sacrifice your love
You'd better come and rescue me...
oh...before it's too late...
