Make me understand the sacred holy land
Filled with shadows from a war it's everywhere
Everlasting souls from temples of this place
Still I`ve got no room for everyone.

I`m able to destroy me enemy
Convicting me condemning me with air
The virgin lies are here but far away
Aming on the way to the stars...to the stars...

Never left for real the soldier made of steel
Crucify is not what he attends to do
Ever fading walls my cross is in the sky
Now I`ve got a room for everyone.

I`m able to destroy me enemy
Convicting me condemning me with air
The virgin lies are here but far away
Aming on the way to the stars...to the stars...

Bravery heavenly are the ways you will be here
Sanctuary penalty are the grafts of destiny
In the sky asking why each disciple has to go
Gather all spirits fall.

What's the answer to the question that we have
You might find it in the stars
Pretty gone since you set my heart on fire
Save the fallen tears of love.

Confucius where are you?
It's time to go!
It's Time Requiem!

Suddenly they screamed the anglesof my dream
Multitude with swords and staves betraying me
Saying all these words that saviors turned aside
Still I`ve got room for everyone.

I`m able to destroy me enemy
Convicting me condemning me with air
The virgin lies are here but far away
Aming on the way to the stars...to the stars...

Have mercy, Lord on me, regard me bitter weeping
Your forgiveness has assured me
Though you Son`s despair and pain.

I do not deny my guilt
But your mercy, if you will
Far exceeded me transgression
Of which I must make confession.
