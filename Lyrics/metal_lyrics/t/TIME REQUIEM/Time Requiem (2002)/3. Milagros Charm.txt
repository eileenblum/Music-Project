You came to me with your visions of life
Using the spirit of love
We might be victims of those who still burn
Look here the damage is done it's for real.

Now is the time and you might be walking on forever
Don't be the one with faking animals in charge
It's for real waiting for someone
who can steer this ship together
This is the everlasting soul of fortune eyes.

Milagros Charm.....
Milagros Charm.....

Two days ago when the full moon was here
I saw the light in the sky
Beauty was rising with fire and ice
Visions of Milagros Charm it's for real.

Now is the time and we might be walking on together
Wielding my sword containing fury hate and blood
Evil eyes, tearing my soul apart.

I'm losing you forever
This is my game and you must reach the holy sky.

It's for real waiting for someone
