I remember those summer days
The wind in our hair and the smile of a dawn
Seeing our future within the stars
Becoming a stone that will last forever
Hand on heart, our message to God
No heaven, no hell, no rest for the brave
Words have no power without the faith
Actions reflect how we live together

Still we go on this endless road
Light that we cannot see
But we can feel the strength that burns
Inside our souls

Promises await
Spread your fire up to the sky tonight
Our kingdom from the roads we'll raise
Echoes of ancient tales return

Voices surrounding my head and the air
A sense of purpose is guiding these days
Running and searching and fighting to catch the moment
Down on my way, I'll follow the signs
No turning back, no time to regret
Mining the walls of this fortress
Healed and divine, passion and pain

Still we go on this endless road
Light that we cannot see
But we can feel the strength that burns
Inside our souls

Promises await
Spread your fire out to the sky tonight
Our kingdom from the roads we'll raise
Echoes of ancients tales return

Promises await
Spread your fire out to the sky tonight
Our kingdom from the roads we'll raise
Echoes of ancients tales

Promises await
Spread your fire out to the sky tonight
Our kingdom from the roads we'll raise
Echoes of ancients tales return

Return
