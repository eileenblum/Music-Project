From the desert to the sea
At the edge of the world
Proudly we are marching
To the light of our god

We are the survivors
The last men that stand
Bringing the secret
A sparkle of life

Waiting for lightning to strike in the air
Breaking the chains of illusion
The price for your vanity, vainglorious nights
Sit on a throne in your castle of sand

Open your heart
We hold the key to our mind
Don't be afraid to fly high
Led by the passion we face every day

Now the time has come
Against the wind we're running
All with the story
All with a voice
We, heroes of our time

Returning to Eden
To a place that we call home
A burning desire in our veins
We're on our way

Can't you see what we've created?
Can't you see where we're going?
In the name of progress, to feed our own ego
Look how we stand in the stream of illusions

Open your heart
We hold the key to our mind
Don't be afraid to fly high
Led by the passion we face every day

Now the time has come
Against the wind we're running
All with the story
All with a voice
We, heroes of our time

Returning to Eden
To a place that we call home
A burning desire in our veins
We're on our way

Now the time has come
Against the wind we're running
All with the story
All with a voice
We, heroes of our time

Returning to Eden
To a place that we call home
A burning desire in our veins
We're on our way

We're on our way

We're on our way
