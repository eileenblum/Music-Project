In the shadows I'm lost
I cannot find my way home
I can't breathe, I'm afraid
But I need to be strong
It is written in stone so I have to move on
No matter if I'm right or wrong
I remember your scent and every word that you said
I recall all the whispers and the tunes that we played
Oh please, don't you forget the promises we made oh

I'm hanging on the wire of my mistakes
Living on the edge sometimes can pay
I'm waiting for you
We'll try to do it right next time around

Hear my call in the rain
I'm feeling something strong deep inside, under my skin
It's not over, not over, not again

Are you thinking of me walking along the strand?
Will you wait there for me to lend me a hand?
Will we meet once again in our promised land?
We'll be together in the end
We can't live in the past 'cause the future is near
The present is tough I know
Things are so unclear

I'm hanging on the wire of my mistakes
Living on the edge sometimes can pay
I'm waiting for you
We'll try to do it right next time around

Hear my call in the rain
I'm feeling something strong deep inside, under my skin
It's not over, not over, not again

Hear my call in the rain
I'm feeling something strong deep inside, under my skin
It's not over, not over, not again

Hear my call in the rain
I'm feeling something strong deep inside, under my skin
It's not over, not over, not again

Hear my call in the rain
I'm feeling something strong deep inside, under my skin
It's not over, not over, not again

I feel you under my skin
Nowhere to hide
No gods to pray to
No time to waste
Why don't you hear my call?
