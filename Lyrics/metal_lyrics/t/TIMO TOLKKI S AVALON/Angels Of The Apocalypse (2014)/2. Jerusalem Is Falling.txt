High on the hill in the city of holy
Neon knights fighting the end is near
Taking the city by storm thy are screaming
Great signs from heaven there is only greed

Losing Eden all you heathens
Fighting for the freedom

Jerusalem
Is falling down
You all are gonna drown
You fall upon the crown
Of the chosen one

Nation against a nation it's true
Saved from the terror the ultimate false
Earthquakes and famine, the final destruction
Fall of the mankind and now it's too late
