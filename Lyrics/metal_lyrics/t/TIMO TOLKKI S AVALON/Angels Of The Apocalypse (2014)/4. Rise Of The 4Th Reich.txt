Oh, can't you see the signs
Oh, can't you hear the lies
That's been fed to you
Mass media corrupted
Politicians hide
You should hear my call

And all the things
You hold so dear
Now spreading lies in awful fear
It's time for you to understand
We lost it all
It's the rise of the 4th Reich

And in this story night
The age is coming back
Stronger than before
Press money economy
Idea is not down
We haven't learned a thing
