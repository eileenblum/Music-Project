Silence is the truth that saves us all
Just before the final fall
Everything is clear and shining bright
All the things just feel so right

There is no turning back now
This day remains in history
Leave all the worries behind
Cause we will make it this time

Stargate Atlantis
Step aside the great big world
Leave behind the old world ruined
Stargate
It's a crazy trip that goes far
We better not forget who we are

How can I know where I do belong
Next to find the little open eyes
So we say I will ask you why
Saved into the paradise beyond the sea
