Soon you'll see the misery
It's turning into a dust
Now you cry the heaven high
These tears will never die

Wait for my star
Wait for destruction
You never even wondered why

The paradise lost
But what is the cost
Darkness will bring light in all of you
The paradise lost
The line has been crossed
The fire will burn over your soul

Did you ever wondered how
You reached the point of no return
Your precious time will soon be over
Fool you'll be dancing with me
