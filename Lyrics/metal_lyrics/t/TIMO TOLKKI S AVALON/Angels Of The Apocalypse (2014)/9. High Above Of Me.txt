Seasons change the price you pay for the
Ignorance won't leave me be on my own
Still I am dreaming forevermore
Seasons change, the snow is falling
Covering the ruins that once were alive
Laughing summer turns to frosty ice

Wake up, this is my dream
Just let me sleep
In my loneliness, high above of me I fly

Seasons change, you're holding on to each
Other's pain, the price you pay is so high
But it is too late for turning back
Winter haze, is covering the landscape
That once was vibrant, alive
Now it is just a memory for me

Wake up, this is my dream
Just let me sleep
In my emptiness, high above of me
These tears will fade away
Into the dust
Embers died long ago
High above of me I fly

And I'm holding on to a miracle
So I can carry on
In my everlasting cage
Leaving you behind, it's crushing me
It's killing me
Alone, I am waiting for, waiting for... forevermore
