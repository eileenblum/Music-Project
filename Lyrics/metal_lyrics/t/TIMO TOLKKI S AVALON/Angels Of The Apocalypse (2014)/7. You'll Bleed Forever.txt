Black of night weakening sight
Whispering wind echoing to the dark
I have seen millions of souls
They left me cold
No more lies

Now my dream is growing cold
Like a shadow in the light of day
As a teardrop falls into a lake
It's a shame... this all

Billion slained all was in vain
There's no tomorrow to hunger its pride
How I wished you could be saved
From what's to come
But it' too late

See my dream is growing cold
Like a shadow in the light of day
As a teardrop falls into a lake
It's a shame... the fall

You'll bleed forever
Cause you don't belong in here
You'll bleed forever
I am closing all the doors

Your times has come to dawn
And your end is getting close
The end is near you're going home
