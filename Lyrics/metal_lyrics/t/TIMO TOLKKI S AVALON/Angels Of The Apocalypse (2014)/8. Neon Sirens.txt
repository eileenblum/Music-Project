Sunday morning
Alone in the shadows
No more voices
No sign of life below
See the lights
Across the toxic sky
Am I looking death
Straight in the eyes

Neon sirens in the street
Screaming through th darkness
And they're coming for me
Neon sirens in the street
Devils in the darkness
Lords of the prophecy
Neon sirens

Monday morning
Lost in the shadows
Is this my last day
Nowhere left to go
In my eyes
I feel the great light
Am I finally
At the end of the line
