The road is open will you find the way
In the dusky setting sun
Life as you know could be different
You don't realize that anymore
The paradise is lost

Design the century
Looking back to history
No way to make this work anymore
Design the century
What is your destiny?
Crucified, you're falling down to this lie

No escape cause there's no other chance
Innocence it died so long ago
Scarred by your own hate the road to ruin
And I have no pity for you
The paradise is lost
