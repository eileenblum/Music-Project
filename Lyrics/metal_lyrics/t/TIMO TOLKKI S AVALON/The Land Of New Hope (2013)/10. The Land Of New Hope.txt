Time goes on forever
We're caught in the game of never
You have come a long way
To find your destiny
The dawn of new way has started

Close your eye and leave all behind
Pure of heart are the ones that can pass through my gate
Leave your old ways and follow the shining light
There is a danger, the dark is always around

Come with me and open your hearts
What you'll see is not somethings you yet understand
I guard this land, it has always been this way
The dark is strong, but it has no place in here

This is the land of new hope
Pure of heart can make their home
It's hidden in your heart, where no one's searching for
There's so much to learn
Just make the turn
I'll show you the way to a new day

You've come home and you've been through much
What you have seen, is the price that you all did pay
But everything can start all over
Time is forever and it's here where we build our future

This is the land of new hope
Where pure of heart can make their home
It's hidden in your heart, where no one's searching for
There's so much to learn
Just make the turn
I'll show you the way to a new day

This is the land of new hope
Where pure of heart can make their home
It's hidden in your heart, where no one's searching for
When all lonely souls unite
Return to the light
Rejoice forever in you
