Moving along, deeper and deeper we go
Light fades away, the enemy is near
Got to be strong, further and further we go
Into the deep the great unknown is waiting

Long time ago hiding my fears in the dark
It's not too late cause it's time to go

We will find a way
There's nothing else to say
We will find the light
The future is shining bright

We will find a way
There's nothing more to say
And in the night
Won't give up the fight
This just feels so right
And we'll find a way
We will find a way

The magic is here
It feels so strong without fear
We're coming home
The land of the hope is near

Long time ago hiding my fears in the dark
It's not too late cause it's time to go

We will find a way
There's nothing else to say
We will find the light
The future is shining bright

We will find a way
There's nothing more to say
And in the night
Won't give up the fight
This just feels so right
And we'll find a way
