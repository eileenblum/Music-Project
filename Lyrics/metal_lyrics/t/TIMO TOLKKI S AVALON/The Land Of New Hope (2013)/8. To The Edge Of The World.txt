Avalon, I know we are so near
I hear its call
There's no way that we will fall
We're here and we're standing tall
Long time ago
We left all behind to seek this place
We only heard of in fairytales
But now it's reality

Our journey's nearning the end
We'll be there

'Round and 'round we go
Facing the mystery
Every moment fades away
Into the history
Each new second and the hour
We'll find what we're looking for
Even if we have to roam to the edge of the world

We face the truth
We die in the name of the rose, we're true
There's magic in the air tonight
Everything feels so right
We're shining white
There is no return it is too late
The gates are near soon we'll face our final fate

Our journey is at the end
We are there

'Round and 'round we go
Facing the mystery
Every moment fades away
Into the history
Each new second and the hour
We'll find what we're looking for
Even if we have to roam to the edge of the world
