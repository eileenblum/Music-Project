A world without us

How is the world withou us?
Is there a chance to adjust?
Where is the beauty we all knew?
Faded away to the dew

And in this end is there hope
Is there a way for us to cope?
With total destruction of all
This is our final call

And so we run and so we hide
Cause it's all done, most of us died

A world without us we're not learning
A world without us not returning
To the new horizons we will roam
We will find at any cost
The beauty that was lost
So into the brave new world we go

Mankind is descends to the grave
Because of the road we did pave
There's nothing left for us to do
The deeds are done, time to go

Still we run, still we hide
And so we live, but most will die

A world without us we're not learning
A world without us not returning
To the new horizons we will roam
We will find at any cost
The beauty that was lost
So into the brave new world we go
