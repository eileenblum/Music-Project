Long time ago
We knew the way
Now all is lost
Nothing to say
We went astray
Future unclear
Nothing left to do
Started a fight
It was in vain 
Marching along
With armies of fools
Lambs to the slaughter
Chaos unseen
Destruction everywhere

Now here in this place it's so calm
The darkness caresing us all

The magic of the night
Can you feel it in the air?
The magic of the night
Better take care

Onwards we go
To the unknown
Still searching for the avalon
Mist on the air
Heavens is near
The ancient tale is true

Now here in this place it's so calm
The darkness caresing us all

The magic of the night
Can you feel it in the air?
The magic of the night
You better take care

The magic of the night
Can you feel it in the air?
The magic of the night
You better take care, beware

The magic of the night
Can you feel it in the air?
The magic of the night
You better take care, beware
You better take care
