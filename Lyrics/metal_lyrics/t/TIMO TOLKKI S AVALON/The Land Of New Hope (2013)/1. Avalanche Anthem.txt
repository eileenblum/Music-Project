Chaos and destruccion, blackouts
The Elements are raging, there is
Nothing left from world we used to know
Mother's nature's domination
The signs were there, we didn't care
Time is running out for human race

Heading to the final hour
Losing all we have the end of our days

Avalanche, Avalanche Anthem
This is the price we pay
Avalanche, Avalanche Anthem
There's nothing left to stay
Avalanche, Avalanche Anthem
Creation on its knees
Avalanche, Avalanche Anthem
Now everyone agrees
