How... how innocence is dying here tonight
In the morning sun
And all that we fought for
Just embers that are glowing in the dark
When the day is done
Still innocence just has to die
Pure and simple, beautiful
And sorrow Still fills my broken heart

In the name of the rose
Die in the rose
Looking through the morning haze I realize
In the name of the rose
Die for the rose
Everything I've ever been forevermore
In the name of the rose

Dying, the innocence is dying here tonight
We got to move on
Fighting, we got to keep on fighting 'til the end
We got to journey on
Towards the avalon we go
The best is yet to come so follow me and others to
The promised land

In the name of the rose
Die in the rose
Looking through the morning haze I realize
In the name of the rose
Die for the rose
Everything I've ever been forevermore
In the name of the rose

In the name of the rose
In the name of the rose
Looking through the morning haze I realize
I'm Die for the rose
Everything I've ever been forevermore

In the name of the rose
Die in the rose
Looking through the morning haze I realize
In the name of the rose
Die for the rose
Everything I've ever been forevermore
In the name of the rose
