Dear old world now I must go
Make me believe
That I can love again
The beauty of the universe
Beneth eternal skies
My soul was born to be free

Shine, just see how we are shining
The everlasting light
Will guide us through a brand new day

Dancing with the gods above
I feel like I have wings
The hymn to life I sing
The silence, we seek to reborn
Goodbye, no words to say
Heaven is in our reach

Shine, just see how we are shining
The everlasting light
Will guide us through a brand new day

Shine, just see how we are shining
The everlasting light
Will guide us through a brand new day
