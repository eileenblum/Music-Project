Shouting our slogans and waving our flags, but never living up to a word we've said.  Is it just an act while you stand on the stage, or a chance to look better before you turn the page?  I won't be like the ones before... I've got some changes to make within myself, and I started making that change today.  Remember all those promises you made?  I can't believe how quick your feelings fade.  I thought you were different, but you're just like the rest.  Never again will I settle for second best.  go! we won't settle for second best.  I can see you're just like the rest.  We won't settle for second best.
