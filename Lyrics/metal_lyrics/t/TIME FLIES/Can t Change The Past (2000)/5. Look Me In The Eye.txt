Can you settle for what's left, or are you reaching for something more?  I remember when you had it all, but you turned away, and threw it all away.  What went wrong?  Don't reach out your hands before you open your eyes.  You're being pulled in every direction, and still end up with nothing but lies.  You've always had all the answers, and they've gotten you nowhere fast.  Look at all the fiends you've had, that left in your past.  What went wrong?  You're running, you're running, you're running, and no one can catch up to you.  You'll be running forever, it's all you'll ever do!  Yeah!  Can you look me in the eye... and tell me nothing's changed?  Can you look me in the eye... and tell me you're the same?  You're not the same!  What went wrong?
