What brings us here together, now sets us apart.  We used to have the same ideas, but I think that you forgot.  Has it really been that long? ... or did you just give up?  I think your ideas have changed, and things will never, ever be the same.  The time is now an you're on top.  No one could ever make you stop Your gossip and rumors won't push us away.  The feelings in our heart won't go away.  This is about acceptance, and I've always accepted you, but now you've stabbed me in the back.  So, what the fuck am I left to do?  for... the... wrong... reason... stop.
