It looks to me like the time has come.  I've found myself at square one.  Starting over was never so easy to do.  My feelings have changed, I put my pride in you.  Security overcom?  My fear has just begun.  Can't change what I've seen, can only change what how you feel.  What to expect?  What do you expect?  And I... I want to believe, believe in something more then this past I've seen.  Can you help me believe?  Letting go and starting over now, I dreamed of these days, but forgot somehow.  My head is straight but there's a smile on my face.  I never thought I'd make it back to this place.  Security overcome?  My fear has just begun.  Can't change the past, can only change how I feel.  What to expect?  What do you expect?  ...and now I believe, believe in something more than this past I've seen.  You've helped me believe.  Letting go.  Letting you know.  I'm not alone.  Starting over now!  It starts again with you.
