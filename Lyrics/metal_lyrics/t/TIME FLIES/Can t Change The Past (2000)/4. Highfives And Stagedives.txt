Looking up to you, to who I thought you were, but I don't think you knew.  You say the feeling's dead, but it never died just because of you... It's not fucking dead.  So you've grown old and things have changed, but I promised I'd stay the same.  I never thought I'd see the day without you by my side...  I guess those days have changed man.  You say it's all been done before, and that we're living in the past.  We love the music and we'll keep it alive, for the kids who care we'll make the moments last!  For the kids that still really care, we'll keep it alive... High Fives and Stagedives.
