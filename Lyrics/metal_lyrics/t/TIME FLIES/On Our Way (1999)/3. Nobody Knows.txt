I can't count all the times or the things that you said.  It wasn't my fault but it's still in my head.  You never gave an inch, but you took more than it was worth.  And you said you hurt when I finally turned.  Are you coming back around like a game of lost and found?  Six months down the road, you'll be gone and nobody knows.  I think it's a shame that it happened this way, But your ego played part and it got in the way.  I think that it's sad and wonder why?  nobody knows.
