Once again... I thought it was all figured out, But I'm not so sure where I stand, And I'm loaded with doubt.  I guess I couldn't be all that you want me to be.  Well did things work out for you, did you get what you wanted?  We're running in circles I gave you all and got half back half the time I know it couldn't be me... I can't believe, i can't believe We're running in circles And we're running, we're running right back again.  Goddamnit, I can't decide, is there room for another chance, Or is it just a waste of my time?  I'm getting tired of these games we're fucking playing Can you make a commitment, can you make the commitment?  Maybe this could work, but is it worth the shot?  I'm not trying to break my fucking heart.  How can I be sure that it wont' hurt again?  How can I be sure that you are my friend.
