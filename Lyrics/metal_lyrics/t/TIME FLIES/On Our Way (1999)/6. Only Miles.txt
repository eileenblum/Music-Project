A lot of things are changing.  Are they for better or for worse?  There's always new faces, but I can't find yours.  I never thought it could be so hard to say goodbye And still feel strong. It's like a piece of me is gone.  around here they cuz us down and counted us out, But we've known what we're about.  I don't blame you because I know it's time, time to get away.  It doesn't mean that I'll forget the times we shared And the things that we did We could do nothing, nothing at all, But we'd do it together.  go!  A smiling face, a highfive in the crowd, We still embrace from town to town.  A lot has changed, but we're still the same I know things will always be this way!  Remember when they cut us down and counted us out, But we knew what we're about.  You can't blame me because I knew it was time, time to get away.  It doesn't mean that we'll forget The times we shared and the things we did.  We'll have forever to do it again, we'll fucking do it again!  With Our Friends!  only miles can split us apart We're at a turning point in life, but you're still in my heart.  only miles can split us apart.  You're at a turning point in life, but you're always in my heart.  Only miles I'm at a turning point in life, but you're always in my heart!
