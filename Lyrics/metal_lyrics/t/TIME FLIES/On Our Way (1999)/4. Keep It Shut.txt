So now you laugh, but you know when it comes back around to you... Is it really that funny when we all sit around Laughing at one another, bringing each other down.  Is our friendship really friendship, or is our friendship just a joke?  If that's what friendship means to you, I'd rather be alone.  Respect, we've got to understand How our humor and actions can hurt the people, The people we call friends.  So now you laugh, but you know when it comes back around to you...
