I remember all those things you said what the fuck goes through your head?  You had it, where have you been?  Too lost in your dreamland to remember your friends?  At least I know I did all I could, because I know I tried But you had other things to do while I sat and cried.  What do you think about when you get high?  You just let life pass you by.  You think that shit makes you look cool?  It looks to me like you're a fool!  where were you when I needed a friend?  You used to claim the edge, but the edge wouldn't bend.  So now you play the fool, and you're playing your part.  You follow the trend, The edge was never in your heart.  It was never in your heart.
