Again, we're left with nothing to say Security was shattered when your feelings faded to grey Forever and counting, But you can't find the time to make up your mind And now I feel so let down, But I know it won't change a think in you, I won't try to change you... Looking back at everything, Looking back I'll try to smile Holding onto all we've said. songs I haven't heard in a while. Trying so hard to make you see That some things are just meant to be But I know I can't compete without you, I'm feeling incomplete. Insecurity's got a hold on me, and i can't break free. I'm surrounded by people, but still feel all alone I'm feeling hollow inside, I can't explain how it feels It's like a part of me is gone, but it's a part of me that's real. Maybe things got off to a bad start Remember the day of my beating heart? Consumed by you, consume my time Could it be I've lost my mind? I know right now I'm hollow inside Running in place within these lines The promise shattered when the foundation sank Solidarity deceased, and now I'm incomplete. Insecurity's got a hold on me, and i can't break free! I'm surrounded by people, But I still feel all alone I'm feeling hollow inside, it seems like I'm dead "I can feel the soil falling over my head" ...falling over my head. I'm responsible for my actions, but I know I'm not to blame. But I know I can't go back, I can only try to bring it back.
