Two years too late... No way!  Two years too late, and maybe you're right But we haven't given up this fight So you can't put us down for having fun (Cause we're having fun) Maybe we missed out on the trend But the spirit we have will continue to spread Two years too late, too late for you!  Music has no time or place Sincerity, like a slap in the face 2 years too late, too late for what?  This music has no time or place Commitment, like a slap in the face 2 years too late, but we're still here holding on.  You'll never know!  You're hanging on to what others want No action of your own when it's time to be bought A belief in progreesion, but not selling out.  Just like the ones in '96 Who said that we all make no sense It's '99 now look at you, you make no sense Music has no time or place Commitment, like a slap in the face 2 years too late, too late for what?  This music has no time or place Commitment, like a slap in the face 2 years too late, but we're still here holding on.  You'll never know!  you'll never know.  I can't let this feeling go.  I never did it for you, I did it for me, But you'd never know.  you never know, you never know.  you'd never know, you'd never know.  you'll never know, you'll never know.
