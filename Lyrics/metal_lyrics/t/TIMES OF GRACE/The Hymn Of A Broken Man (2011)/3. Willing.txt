I wake with the wings of morning
To the light of a new day
Now my eyes are open

Through the darkest times
I find you
I find you always

Cover me
With your hands
Make me see
All I am

Though I fall
I'm willing

I could break 
Fall back into sorrow
Give me life
Make my faith much stronger

Now my eyes are open
Now I feel I'm lost
I find a way
I find a way
I find a way to you

Cover me
With your hands
Make me see
All I am

Though I fall
I'm willing

This is the now 
No longer will I wait my time
Can't lose faith 
There'll be days of grace
I'd give it all
I'd give it all 
To see redemption reign

Cover me 
With your hands
Make me see
All I am 

Though I stumble
Though I stumble

Though I fall I'll live for you
