Falling (falling), fell to the depths of your regrets (regrets),
Now thereâs nothing left but apathy.

Blinded by pride, torn on the inside at the cost of your arrogance.
Worldâs last hope for deliverance, now your broken wings mirror your filthy regret.

[Chorus:]
Why do we live so blind
Like a fallen angelâs eyes turned inside?
This is a hymn of a broken man.

Falling (falling), cast out from blessedness,
Now thereâs nothing left, nothing but apathy.

[Chorus]

God save you.
God save your soul turned inside.
This is a hymn of a broken man.

If you could only see the truth, for pride has blinded you.
Feel with your heart, disregard has killed you once again.

[Final Chorus:]
Why do we live so blind
Like a fallen angelâs eyes turned inside?
This is a hymn of a broken man.
Why do we live so blind?
This is a hymn of a broken man.
Why do we live so blind?
This is a hymn of a broken man.

God save, God save us all.
God save, God save us all.
