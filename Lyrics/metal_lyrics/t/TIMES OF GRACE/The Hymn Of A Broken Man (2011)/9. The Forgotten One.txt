Words only lead me to the cracks in my disguise
My flesh a prison for the man behind these eyes
I sing the epitaph for an unnamed king
Carved in this tombstone all the lost pieces of me
How far is the distance between you and I?
How long before this silence dies?

Lost in a sea of sadness
Blind in this place of darkness
If I fall would you be there to raise me up?
Or will I be the forgotten one?

Lead me to the crossroad, I can find my way home
Devils on my back and angels in between
The scars and dreams that made me believe
Wheres the crime scene in remembrance to me
When our eyes meet do you know the man beneath
Walk the line between desperate and redeemed

Lost in a sea of sadness
Blind in this place of darkness
If I fall would you be there to raise me up?
Or will I be the forgotten one?

And my hymns are songs for the broken
(Through every word that was spoken)
(Do I carry hope for the whole place)

Lost in a sea of sadness
Blind in this place of darkness
If I fall would you be there to raise me up?
Or will I be the forgotten one?
