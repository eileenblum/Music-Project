As we live in these dark days filled with violence, opposition and hate.
There lies a place of saving grace
Protected in the hearts of the humble
The faithful, the ones who choose the path of resistance to protest
Protect, save, proclaim our lives lived not in vain.
In flesh, in spirit eternal
One love, One truth, One destiny

One love! (one love) one truth! (one truth) one destiny

Arise and be triumphant
No rest until all is fulfilled
Our roots must balance our branches
Be vigilant in truth and love
(in truth and love)

[Chorus:]
There is a strength in numbers we must unite mankind
There is a strength in numbers, our faith lies deep inside
(We!) We struggle, (We) we suffer, (So) so we must come together
(We!) We struggle, (We) we suffer, (but) but we will live forever

Babylon's method of deception
So devious the strong are swayed
(so devious, the strong are swayed)

[Chorus:]
There is a strength in numbers we must unite mankind
There is a strength in numbers, our faith lies deep inside
(We!) We struggle, (We!) we suffer, (So!) so we must come together
(We!) We struggle, (We!) we suffer, (but!) but we will live forever

(One love, one truth)
(One love, one truth)

[Guitar Solo]

One love! (one love) one truth! (one truth) one destiny

(Yeaaaaah)

[Chorus:]
There is a strength in numbers we must unite mankind
There is a strength in numbers, our faith lies deep inside
(We!) We struggle, (We!) we suffer, (So!) so we must come together
(We!) We struggle, (We!) we suffer, (but!) but we will live forever

May the sun shine upon you and bless your inner light
and may you find true peace
