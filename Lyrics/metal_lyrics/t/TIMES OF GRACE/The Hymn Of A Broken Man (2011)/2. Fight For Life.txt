Underneath a darkened sky, drifting through a sea of lies,
Pulled into the undertone, my body dragged deep below.
This man came unto the sun, senses changed evermore.

Give me strength to push on through (give me strength),
Seeking shelter from the storm.

[Chorus:]
Carry my way, I canât go on.
Uplift my spirit until I carry on.
Was once lost, but now Iâm found.
Darkness pass away into the light of dawn.
Push on through.

Fight for life!
Fight for life!

My war is not yet finished, but with the spirit I rest.

I fear no death!
I fear no man!
I will prevail!

Give me strength to carry on, push on through the light of dawn.
(Push on through)

[Chorus]

Fight for life!
Fight for life!
Push on through!

Fight for life!
Fight for life!
Push on through!
