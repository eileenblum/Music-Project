We are lost, consumed by selfish desire.
Abandon the gift bestowed us.
The gift alone.

[Chorus:]
But there is beauty,
There is life.
Hold fast for this could be,
The end of eternity.

We are blind (we are blind), our futureâs crushed and forgotten.
Destroyed by guilt (destroyed by guilt).

[Chorus II:]
But there is beauty (there is beauty),
There is life (there is life).
Hold fast for this could be,
The end of eternity.

I will slaughter your soul, break you into submission.
I will be waiting in the shadows, until your last breath.

Donât forsake us.
Donât turn away from us.
Your will is stronger than this.

Something strange has slowly lifted souls.
Under shadows, a gift to the realms of death.

Like grains of sand, it slips from your arms in graves.

And in my sweet seduction I break your lips, your lips.

[Chorus II]

I will slaughter your soul, break you into submission.

I will be waiting.
I will be waiting.
I will be waiting.
