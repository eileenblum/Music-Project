Cast me into the sea (into the the heart of of darkness)
Falling from on high, (drowning in sorrow)
hopeless and lost (hopeless and lost)
Consumed by fears
My soul was weak within me
Canât learn from this destiny
Just give me your mercy
I go where the spirit leads me
Let go of my desire, Your word is my guide
Save me from this fate
hopeless and lost (hopeless and lost),
Consumed by fears
Will you save me
My soul was weak within me
Canât run from this destiny
Just give me your mercy,

I go where the spirit leads me
Let my mouth be the blade (be the blade)
Let my song be filled with me (filled with me)
Be the blade? Fill with me?
My soul was weak within me
I canât run from this destiny,
Just give me your mercy
I go where the spirit leads me
Where the spirit, where the spirit rides.
