All of Life
All of time

A life lived with closed eyes
The faceless images leave my mind
And I've lost my way
Worlds Apart
Led astray, severed by this darkened heart.

Seeking answers
open these eyes,
Searching for the truth
open my eyes.

All of life
All of time
It's just a moment
So just behold it

All of life
All of time
It's ours to take,
A soul reborn

My soul reborn.

And I'm bound by the weight of my regret
Untangle my soul, so I may live again.

Seeking answers
Open these eyes
Searching for the truth
Will you open my eyes

All of life
All of time
It's just a moment,
So just behold it
All of life
Allof time
It's ours to take,
A soul reborn

Some are blinded,
some refuse to hear
Embrace this beauty
Before it disappears

All of life
All of time
It's just a moment,
So just behold it,
All of life
All of time
It's ours to take,
A soul reborn
Be reborn

And all of life
And all of time,
It's just a moment.
