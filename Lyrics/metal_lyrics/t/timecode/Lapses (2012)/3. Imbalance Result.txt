[Music: Celso GarcÃ©s, Danilo Estrella / Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s]

I've lost identity confined to this place
Where violence grows crushing the coherence
I impelled myself to this psychiatric world
Where everything is an illogical pattern of the soul

"Believe in my shapeless words
Feeds the mind's demise
I am your imbalance result
And you are my chaos that corrodes all wounds"

Creating hysteria in a moment of utter lunacy
Panic separates the senses from reality
To yell won't help inside the mind
To discern is a privilege that here no one has

Progressive stages of dementia
Periods of mental deterioration
"I am your imbalance result
And you are my confusion disturbing the thoughts"

We have no life
We have only fear inside
Living in a permanent lie
Conforming unreal reflections

How can I reach inner sanity to overcome this grief?
Can I define this as real?
-All that you see doesn't exist-

I've lost identity confined to this place
Where I've found my own anomaly
(I'm not sane)
