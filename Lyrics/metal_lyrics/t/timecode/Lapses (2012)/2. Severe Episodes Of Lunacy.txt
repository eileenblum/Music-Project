[Music &amp; Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s]

(I'm not sane)

(I)
Like a withered dream
I reduced my life to the size of this room
And here I sit down
Paralyzed, hypnotized by four walls painted grey
No windows, no doors
Just a strange constant voice
Repeating that (I'm not sane)
(I'm not sane)
And insects crawl in my feet
Trying to rise to my futile head

(The voice)
I'm the voice that comes from all around
Echoed in your head as plentiful laughs
I'm the reason of all your fears
When darkness arrives,
Confusion just begins

(I)
The light has gone away
Nothing will make subside my lunacy
I hear a whisper in my ear
Asking if I'm going to die and I say:
-"Touch my eyes to see what I see"-

(The Voice)
But I'm everything in this room
Possible to be seen
(Enas ton mâI)
Don't you ever tell me what to do
'cause I decide what is real

(I)
The light has gone away
Now I feel like a guest in my own life
And suddenly I hear the voice
In reverse yelling that (I'm not sane)
So, take my hand to feel what I feel
I've turned into a part of your feverish feast

(I'm not sane)
(I)
Where were you when I needed you most?
(He)
I was standing beside the locked door
(I)
How can I release myself from it?
(He)
You can't... You will live in here forever

(The voice)
The light has gone away
I'm the architect of this masterpiece,
The silent stalker of your calm
For 32 years I've been trying to break you down
Finally I've succeeded
No one will take your place
No one will hear what you hear
