[Music &amp; Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s ]

Twisted images are turning into my head
Like a starving vulture searching for flesh
I have no choice, I can't avoid confusion
The damnation has begun
When existence is compelled by distress
Life goes out as my prayers are consumed
By your desire

I repent myself for the sins
(I'm not sane)
I won't be afraid to exist as entity and be your slave
When forgiveness has been gone

In Mother's arms, lingering end
She embraces me tight just to keep me in here
It's useless; I've lost all that I've loved in life,
So, Please let me say wave goodbye
The eternity for me has begun
I prepare myself for the inevitable path of death

Her sorrow
Your will
No matter how much it grieves
Her pain is all around

She blames herself
She'd give her life
To extend this day with me
