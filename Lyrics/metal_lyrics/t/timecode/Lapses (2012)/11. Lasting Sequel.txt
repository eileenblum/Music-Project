[Music &amp; Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s]

It's so hard to be pleased,
Pleased when I don't want to feel better,
'cause it hurts me so much,
So much that I just want to stay away forever.

As I look inside my life
I found thousand reasons to hate you
And I realize
That I'll lose my mind at any second

The aging will come someday
Captive growing pain
The calling of another life
The lasting sequel turns inside my mind

Daily I feel distressed,
Distressed and I don't want to feel better.
Instants that can't be erased,
It will never be erased with psychological treatments

Standing beside myself
No one around to dry my tears
That is why
My contempt for you can't be healed.

The spineless whisper
Of mental ailment
The shivers of my past
Running through my eyes
(I'm not sane)
(I'm not sane)
You just have to know
That (I'm not sane)
