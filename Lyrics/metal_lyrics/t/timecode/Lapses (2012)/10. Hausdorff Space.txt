[Music &amp; Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s]

The discordant process
Of non-physical rupture of my brain through rage
Projecting a violent other-self
The shocking expression of hollow eyes
-Am I prepared to be replaced?-

The unusual self-contraction of nothingness
Begins in my face
This trance is gestated to itself
With imaginary visualizations

Unanimated contorted holes provoke
Frantic illusory forms
That have replaced the eyesight
With broken mirrors within
-The manic expression of distress
Eloquence makes no sense-

The beauty of two parts in severance
When I see through blindness
And I'm in the middle of none...

Just look down
The illegible iteration has been born

(I)-The reflection unseen
(Am)-The none conceived

(Not)-Two ways inside
(Sane)-(Im)perfectly (in)sane
