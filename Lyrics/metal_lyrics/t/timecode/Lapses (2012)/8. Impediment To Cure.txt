[Music &amp; Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s]

When day ends
It seems like I'm drowning with their faces
Regardless of what I've drunk to forget
I feel trapped in small spaces

I wrote on that wall
The nonsense of too many words
Trying to describe what I've lived,
What they made me live.

-"Try to stay away from it"-
(He told me some time)
-"try to live my pain,
Then you will understand"-
(I said)

No therapy able to cure
All those worthless attempts
(I'm not sane)
To recover a normal life
And to close reopened memories

In quietness,
Searching for answers
There must be some way to get out of here
It's difficult to find,
To find a way to heal
For sure,
I'm the impediment to my own cure

It just gets worse
I'm completely weak and exhausted

-"I'm so fucking sick and tired
To be who I am"-
-"But suicide is the best way to forget"-
(He explained)

(I'm not sane)
