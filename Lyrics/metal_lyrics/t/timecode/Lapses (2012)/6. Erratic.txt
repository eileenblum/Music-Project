[Music &amp; Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s]

I've no longer control over it
Irrational voices are maddening me
Bounds of mental tolerance exceeded
By intrusion of an incurable disease
A drawing of this systematic organic failure
It's like waves colliding inside my fearful mind

Erratic behavior
The frenzy has been completed

Increased heartbeats, omen of my death
I'm destined to another level of pain
Now itâs not aching -but- remains within

Erratic behavior
The frenzy has been completed
Cerebral dysfunction
Contorted sanity

(I'm not sane)

What part of my life is truly under control or waiting for a cure?
What part of my life can't I replace or hide even if I sell my soul?
