[Music &amp; Lyrics: Celso GarcÃ©s]

I am walking through my memory's corridors in recess
And I found vestiges of an intangible cage
Frightening pieces like an open grave
Where everything inside is not what it seems to be.
Am I standing here?
-or- Am I waiting outside?
In a discontinuous place
Faced with myself
In a judgment lapse
Repeating over and over again
(I'm not sane)

Now I'm passing beyond my psychological tolerance
An euphoric state of reversion, a prolonged trance
Where I'm nothing and the only one
Against the mindless sequences of my life undone
In a judgment lapse
Faced with myself
In a discontinuous place
Am I waiting outside?
Am I standing here?
Repeating over and over again
(I'm not sane)

Lapses
A discontinuous place...
(I'm not sane)

I'd never meant to be here
It's supposed this should be what I want
Now I can't turn back
Even if I could have controlled my tragic outcome

...In a judgment lapse
Repeating over and over again
(I'm not sane)
In lapses - in recess
Repeating (I'm not sane)
In lapses - reversion
Repeating my name
Over and over again
