[Music: Cagadera / Lyrics: Felipe âVâ, Celso GarcÃ©s]

Inside this white room
Itâs burning my head
Nobody in here to tell me what is fake
Corpses and ghosts
Kicking in my head
I canât erase them and it will never end

I will show them (Show them)
I will inflict them the most horrible fear
Life has taught me (Taught me)
Life has inflicted me the whole possible pain

All those faces
Are burning my eyes
Are remembrances of time that wonât past
I hear the voices
Inside of my head
Telling me that the world should be incinerated

I canât explain why I feel such hate
So, to be confined seems to be my fate
And Iâll never live this way
I choose to die
I canât explain why I feel relief with pain
If you keep me apart, I wonât hurt anyone
suffering keeps me alive
