[Music: Garces/Caviedes, Lyrics: Lazo/Caviedes]

Watch my eyes and say what you find
Don't scare this isn't a dream
Taking advantage of my innocence
A sequence of emotional aggressions
Your words are useless crap
I never saw an action in here
My pupils always admired you
With blocked thoughts

Stop talking
Do not cry again
You won't get my hand cut

You did not remember
That children we wouldn't be always

Games of confidence
Confused expressions
Ruined Feelings

*
Hidden your lies with the tool of conviction
"Through your future you'll understand"
Bitterness' phrase, chain of pain
Whips of depression, you thought someday
That you would be in this place
Whips of depression

Destruction has began on our bows
Unpredictable errors on your future
I remember what you did it will take revenge
Changed destiny, what it had meant to be

[solo: Graces]

[solo: Espinoza]

Even bounded through this tie
There won't be a new start
Try some other puppets for your fun
Create your hell outside my world
Now it's my turn to destroy your senses
And think which will be your end

Now I will be
Who will show you
Your last goodbye

[repeat *]
