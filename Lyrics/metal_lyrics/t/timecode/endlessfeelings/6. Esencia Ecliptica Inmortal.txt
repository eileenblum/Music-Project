[Music: Garces, Lyrics: Garces]

We lost the faith in our creed
We did not hold this hell
The request to lose our heart
Memories begin the torture
The time doesn't consume the wounds
The years tear passing by
Invalid faces contemplating
The pain from our spiritual death

*
The fire tears the meat
And The space consumes the corporal power
Next life will wait for our souls
We will return to be born in the stars

**
Please forget our sins
Take us to the eternal life
Listens to the death pleas
Leave us to be born again
From the Earth to the sky
In eternal flight to die
Our pacific ecliptic essence
A final burial for the flesh

[solo: Garces]

That image printed in the eyes
Both fear and horror merged them
We traveled through the infinite space
Awaiting the resurrection

[repeat *]
[repeat **]

Our cosmos already is dominated
By phantoms of our galaxy
They sail through the infinite space
Awaiting the resurrection
