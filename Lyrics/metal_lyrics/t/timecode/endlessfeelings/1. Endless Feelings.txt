[Music: Garces/Caviedes, Lyrics: Caviedes]

Eyeless view of my inner reality
Insanity provided by eternal desires
Sad memories becoming senseless acts
Hands guiding me towards the final step

Endless Feelings
Endless Life

Giants ghosts surrounding me
Fearless dreams inside the room
A hand of white hope in my throat
Sweating confusion, drinking silent tears

Endless Feelings
Endless Facts

*
Did I pass the door?
The pain continues around me
Lonely as I use to be
Looking for understanding
Did I break my curse?
A second chance, a second end
Drowning within myself
Am I crossing the threshold?

[solo: Garces]

Endless Feelings
Endless Death

[repeat *]
