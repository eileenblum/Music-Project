[Music: Garces/Caviedes, Lyrics: Garces]

We looked for Identity
In the borders of the universe
We looked for the truth
Uncertain is our origin
A route to follow beyond of the humanity
The galaxy explores
In search of that place

*
Hidden
Lives
Eternal travelers
Planet
Sheltered
Unknown Beings

Towards the stars
My body sails
As a comet
My life is eternal
My mind in the space
Floating next to the stars
Guided to the truth
My life will not end

[repeat *]

Return from the sky
With reddened wings
Infinite universe
Lifetime image

[solo: Espinoza]

[repeat *]
