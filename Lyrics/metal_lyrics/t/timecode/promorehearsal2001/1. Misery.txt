[Music: Garces/Caviedes/Espinoza, Lyrics: Lazo]

[solo: Espinoza]

Misery embodied in a man
Answer of solitude
Meat pieces in their mouth
They show you raw reality

*
He doesn't respond before the look
Of the affection this remote one
He requests not to wake up
And arrive to a better place

Wandering for each place
Requesting some pity
Scheming as achieving
To leave that illness

[repeat *]

[solo: Espinoza]

Living single penuries
The alone one is allowed to be
He doesn't find as fighting
Poverty marked in their face

[repeat *]
