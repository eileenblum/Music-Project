Delirium
In Delirium
I saw mountains in your eyes
I saw the Devil without its horns
Clean waters and purple skies.

I found all from the vale of haze
I saw this all in different ways
Far away, in my secret place
I saw your sparkling face

Tear my heart to pieces
Now rip me to pieces

No truth on TV news
No love in society
I am floating smile on my face
On the waves of eternity

There are the stars and there is the moon
Sun shines and there comes a monsoon
Oh, how itÂ´s nice
Time after time
Share it all with you

Tear my heart to pieces
Now rip me to pieces

YouÂ´re heaven and all...
Oh yeah,
The place of dead and all...
Oh yeah,
Mesmerize me
Hypnotize me
Delirium take me
Again and again...

YouÂ´re heaven and all...
Oh yeah,
The place of dead and all...
Oh yeah,
Mesmerize me
Hypnotize me
Delirium take me
Again and again...

Again and again...
Again and again...
