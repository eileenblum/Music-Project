[2010 compilation "Epilogue From The Past"]But you are the rose
In The middle of all depravity

I love you
Endlessly until the end
And there's no final end

You are, You're the smile
In the middle of all misery
Oh, you are
One of a kind

[Chorus:]
Fly higher beautiful(Don't burn your wings)
Don't get stuck into the flow (I'll go with you)
Much higher beautiful (I'm there for you)
I'll cover you, I'll cover you (I`ll die for you)

With my aching soul I will
Drive away all the shadows
Which are dancing in your room

I'm crying your tears,and you cry mine
It's more stronger than poisoned wine

[Chorus:]
Fly higher beautiful(Don't burn your wings)
Don't get stuck into the flow (I'll go with you)
Much higher beautiful (I'm there for you)
I'll cover you, I'll cover you (I`ll die for you)
