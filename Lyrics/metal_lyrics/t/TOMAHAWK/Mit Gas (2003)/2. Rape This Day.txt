You're the only one I ever told
That I will rape this day

Got a barking dog
And a smile to tell
And I will hate this day

Sporting the name brands
Clothes make the man
And I will rape this day

Guess a heart won't break
That ain't pumpin' Kool-aid

I got a fighting chance
You know you promised me the last dance
A micro naught in time
This fat 24 is all mine
Nothing but moans and blood
And so my blood counts my loss
You cannot eat just one
A diaphragm revelation

Just want to get some disease
And get your stampin' heart the hell outta here

I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
Rape this day

This is the real mouth
Sew it up and fly south
And I will rape this day

I'll blow with you on the ground
Or leave it 'til the leaves turn brown

And I will pinch and tear
And pull and kick you right there
I'll proud and jerk and stretch
Into a pretty bruise, a cat scratch
Put a rake on your neck
But who would cry or complain?
Compared to the pain of your sorry white vein...

I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
I'm gonna rape this day
