I am the harelip give me one more kiss
We'll have a mardi gras on deserted streets
Fingers and forceps, rock me to muzak
The bubbles in fine wine keep the nerves steady

I was awake all through the surgery
The people dancing, laughing all for me
you sewed me up but it will never heal
Will I forget then learn to smile someday?

Potbelly, sickbed, all scars and sweet bread
A lonely vacation, your own Disney parade
It's all that he has
Clamped up by walkmans
A midnight waiting room, hear the distant screams
