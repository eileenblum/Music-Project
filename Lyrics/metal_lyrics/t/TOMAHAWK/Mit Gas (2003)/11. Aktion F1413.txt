Basic principles of hand-to-hand combat:
1. Be aggressive
2. Keep your eyes on the opponent
3. Distract the opponent
4. Disable or be disabled

I see what you do I keep on my way through
I'll see what you'll be; what you'll do

5. Vary the attack to fit the situation
6. Turn the defence into an unrelenting attack
7. Feel superior to the opponent â regardless of the latter size or evidence of strength

I see what you do I keep on my way through
I'll see what you'll be; what you'll do

You know you will have little time to stop and think when engaging in hand-to-hand combat.
Further more your actions must be automatic
Remember attack aggressively with one purpose in mindâto kill!
