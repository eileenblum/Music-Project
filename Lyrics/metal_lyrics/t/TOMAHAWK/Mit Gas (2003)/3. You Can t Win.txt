Yes you want to bleed, then come along with me
We're only half breeds, but we'll be home free
So mark your territory, cause it's on
Point your barrel, Joe
We're gonna mow them down, we've got a feeling
It's living and breathing
We know how cheap our freedom is
But I'm a best washed in
Walking down the street like a speed ball,
Probably like a cat, I don't know they prowl around
But I ain't taking no more
Cause it's on
And every power abused
and every item consumed
Now it's on, cause it's on
I love to piss genetic
And we all can see clear
Cause it's on, and it's on
It's on
We are the police and now we're going to start a riot
It's on
Now you see just stop, we're going to start a riot
We are the police and now we're going to start a riot

Don't know where to begin, start all over again
And it's on, yeah it's on
And if you think you're free, then you'd better believe
That it's on, and it's on
And we're beginning to think every prize is strong
Cause it's on, and it's on
And the crap and the cream, and don't fuck with me
Cause it's on, and it's on
And we aint got a proper date for you
Cause it's on, and it's on
And we can't take you over cause you're taking care
Cause it's on, and it's on
It's on
We are the police and now we're going to start a riot
Subtlety or not, we're going to start a riot
We are the police and now we're going to start a riot
Subtlety or not, we're going to start a riot
