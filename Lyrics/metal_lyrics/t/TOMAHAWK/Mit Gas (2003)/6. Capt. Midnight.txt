Wake up;
Our past stops right now
I see light, must be you
Watch and learn
Burning it blue
Blood boiling
In slow motion
Only shines
Distortion
Don't be afraid

What?
Are you surprised?
I'm staying alive
I spit in your eye, drive a stake in you
Take me away, take me away
I gave you the world, it was all for you
But I'm sick and tired of wasting time
I want mine
Take me away, take me away
I gave you the world, it was all for you
Stinkin' lies, stinkin' lies, stinkin' lies

We'll die trying to live so long
I can wait, and I should
Leave the phone of the hook
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
