Once the blind eye watches the other
I'm looking for you, for it stops at you
We just say the same thing teacher says
Down on the creek bed, in the big water
She'd have had to blow up her chance

Nightcrawler
Midnight caller
Should have been me
Baby don't look down
It should have been me
Nightcrawler
Tightrope walker
Should have been me
Baby don't look down
It should have been me

One for sorrow, two for joy
Three for a girl, four for a boy
Five for silver, six for gold
Seven for a secret never to be told

Let's go!

Once the blind eye watches the other
Hear that sucking sound
CIRCUS IS IN town
Once the lips are singing to me
I'm the psycho bit
Murder, admit it
The wire will round it down
Down
