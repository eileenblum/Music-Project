I got a love that's second to none
You and me and him makes it one

About as wide as the sea
Thinner than a butt of a flea

A love that slits its own throat
D'amour, je tiens peau

I got a love that's greater than me
With more bitch hatred than me
Got a thing more sacred than we
You and me and him makes three

Got memory, don't need a tattoo
Young blood, a dream fool
Horizon stretch-skin eyes
Le plume insure that carries lies

You will carry my lies

If they ask you don't know a thing
Just grab my piece and look through the ring

I got a love that's greater than me
With more bitch hatred than me
Got a thing more sacred than we
You and me and him makes three

Enter my waratorium
You are my weapon, my son
Countrydom is thicker than mud
You and me and him makes it one

I got a love that's second to none

You and me and him makes it one
