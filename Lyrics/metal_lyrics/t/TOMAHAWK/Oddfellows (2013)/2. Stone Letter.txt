Well Iâm upset, cause I can check
Itâs like Iâm relying, speaking free
Like we used to be for such a long time
Well I throw you a stone letter smooth or rough
And I hope you read it one day, and feel the love

[Chorus:]
Iâve said it, stone letter
Thinking I could know you better
Cause I donât know you, know you anymore
I wrote it, you got it
But tonight, thought about it, you donât know me, know me anymore

â¦ like a skeleton is talking too loud
I think I hear, I think Iâm near a forest of clowns
Watching you degrade yourself, is degrading me
I got no say about you, I â¦ anything

[Chorus:]
Iâve said it, stone letter
Thinking I could know you better
Cause I donât know you, know you anymore
I wrote it, you got it
But tonight, thought about it, you donât know me, know me anymore

na-na-na-na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus:]
Iâve said it, stone letter
Thinking I could know you better
Cause I donât know you, know you anymore
I wrote it, you got it
But tonight, thought about it, you donât know me, know me anymore
I said it, you read it
I said it, you read it
