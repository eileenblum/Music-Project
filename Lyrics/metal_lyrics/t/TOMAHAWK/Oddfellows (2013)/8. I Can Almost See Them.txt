Up Scope
But I can almost see them

Just out of focus, you're so far away
Right out of focus, you're so far away

Down periscope
We all need, all need some rope
But I can almost see them

Just out of focus, you're so far away
Twist the barrel, not so far away

We all need some rope every now and then
We all need some rope every now and then

But I can almost see them
