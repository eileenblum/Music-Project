Eat with the left
Wipe with the right
Eat with the left
Wipe with the right

Look at your ink
And all you can paint
Up inside me

The bite
That presses down
The pillow on your mouth

I lie tonight
Squirming on and on
And the radio plays

Tonight
We never
Never
Should have played make believe

You rub me so wrong
Rub me so wrong
Please keep your clothes on
Keep your clothes on

You rub me so wrong
Rub me so wrong
Play with a south paw

And the radio plays

What's that?
The thing on your lip
You got
Some shit
Hanging off your lip

Just bite it off
And save yourself
The embarrassment

And the radio plays
Radio plays!

On and on and on and on and on
Radio plays

You rub me so wrong
Rub me so wrong
Please keep your clothes on
Keep your clothes on

You rub me so wrong
Rub me so wrong
Play with a south paw

Eat with the left
Wipe with the right
Eat with the left
Wipe with the right
