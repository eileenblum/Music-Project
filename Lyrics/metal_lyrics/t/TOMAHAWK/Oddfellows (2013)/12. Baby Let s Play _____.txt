Baby, let's play dead
I got a hole in my head
Yeah, baby, let's play dumb
Straight to kingdom come
Let the ashes fall
Fall down on me tonight
Bone dry...
Bone dry...
Bone dry...
You know why
Baby, let's play ball
Let the power fall
Yeah, baby, play it again
Ad nauseum
Let it all fall down
Fall down on me tonight
Bone dry...
Bone dry...
Bone dry...
You know why
