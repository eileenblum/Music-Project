Eyes like piss holes in snow
Heavy breathin' on the phone
Salty clumps of seaweed hair
Blow a kiss and I'm there
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Fiances' well padded room
Syrup drips, silky smooth
Holidays in twin beds
These halcyon days will never end
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Lilies sway indoors, cool
Compass points away from you
Decide
Decide
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
Honeymoon
