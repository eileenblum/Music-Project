We all know our place
Like the trophy in the case
We are never known
The wallpaper in the room
We all know the joys
See the beauty of our toy
We are not your song
Elevator, shopping malls
We all want what's free
'Cause we have no memory
We are coming home
We know we are not alone
Sir! Yes sir!
[repeat]
We are not the ones
Who will take away your guns
We are not too late
Also transindental pain
We will win the fight
With explosive dynamite
You are never wrong
Like the people in your palm
We will not resist
Simplify it with a kiss
We want victory
Fresh puffed-up celebrity
We all want what's free
'Cause we have no memory
We are coming home
We know we are not alone
Sir! Yes sir!
[repeat]
The best of everything is good enough for me, 'nough for me
We are not the the ones
Who will take away your sons
We are not afraid
Of a splattering of brains
We won't let them go
With a touch of (?) makes a crime
We see from above
Send a mushroom cloud of love
We salute
We even speak the truth
Shoot a victim man
'Tis a sacrificial lamb
We all want what's free
'Cause we have no memory
We are coming home
We know we are not alone
