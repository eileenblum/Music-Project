The world is growin' old
And preparin' for sleep
But you and me are just not gettin' outta bed
Wakin' up
Sunbathing on the shores of a nightmare
I wish you were here
'Cause they say
We say
And we say
Eternity is all used up
And our hell has frozen over
But it ain't that cold
It's warm enough
Sunbathing on the shores of a nightmare
I wish you were here
'Cause they say
We say
And we say
That we're saved
We're saved
That we're saved
