From the groves of spice,
Over fields of rice...
Afront the lotus stream,
A plant with dew...
I will bring for you,
A little lovely dream,
A little lovely dream.
Dear eyes,
Goodnight,
In a golden light,
The stars around you will gleam...
On you,
I will press soft caress,
Little lovely dream...

Sweet sweet,
Shut your eyes,
The wild fireflies...
The wild fireflies,
Dancing through the prairie near...
Straight from the poppy bowl,
It was for you i stole,
And just for you i stole this little lovely dream...

Hush be my baby,
Your time will soon come,
Thy slave shall be broken,
My trumpet and drum,
Hush be my darlin',
And rest while you may,
For strife comes with livin',
And wakin' with the day...
Sleep on my dearest,
The timing of my heart,
Sleep sleep my darlin',
Sleep sleep on,
Sleep sleep my darlin',
Sleep sleep my darlin',
Sleep sleep sleep on...

I have brought for you,
A little lovely dream,
A little lovely dream,
When dawn lights the skies,
Open my eyes...
