We look far in the quiet but we never see
Turn my eye deep inside but we never say
The spirits fades
Our fortune from blood of the enemy
Nesting up in the woods of your family
Now fly away
You were young
You got pride
All your power inside
What your spirit say
Let you roar let you cry and make you say

We look far in t he quiet but we never see
Turn my eye deep inside but we never say
The spirits fades
Close your eyes and you'll hear the horizon speak
Visualize all the forms i can take
And don't be afraid
You were old
You were wise
All your powers are power your spirit say
Let you crawl let you cry and make you say
