I was born on the night of the falling star by the Virgin and the Man
I was sent over here to be the saviour of worlds
To heal the people and set them free

I was supposed to be the one to wear the crown
The one to share the pain of the poor, of the ill
Forgive the sins accrued in thousand years
And lead the human race towards a better life and reveal
How love can truly save the one who does really believe
How the light erase the dark that lies in the heart of each man

And only with one touch I'll heal the humble dying
And only with one look I'll bring him back to life
And only with my stare I'll open the masses' eyes
Bringing justice between men

But in my dreams I see an evil man who's dressed
As holy priest and sends his son to die in war
He wants to expand his realm
Increase his wealth of gold
He doesn't care of Love
He really needs no Love and declares he does it all for God
Saying he does really believe
He'll send me to the cross
I threaten his status of king

And only with my touch I'll reduce the distance that separates men from the sky
And then again only with my words I'll change the social order
Bringing justice between men

I'm the new Messiah and you, you call me Jesus
I'm the messenger they announced in the Bible
I'm the new Messiah who will give you Light
I'm the son of God who wash away the sin

I'm the new Messiah and you, you call me Jesus
I'm the messenger they announced in the Bible
I'm the new Messiah who will give you Light
I'm the son of God who wash away the sin
I'm the new Messiah and you, you call me Jesus
I'm the messenger they announced in the Bible
I'm the new Messiah who will give you Light
I'm the son of God who wash away the sin
