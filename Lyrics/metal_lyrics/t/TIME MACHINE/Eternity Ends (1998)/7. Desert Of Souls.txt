Time's standing still
From my grave I observe the outside
Slowly nights turn into days and centuries pass by
Eyes that ain't mine watch a world that I see clearly
The change of time makes nothing change
On the beat of drums centuries go by

Wishing all could last forever
Our mission remains overcome
Anyone's freedom to be

Once I used to be the deadly arm of the Inquisition
Today I'm the law, I'm a cop, I'm your judge
On the shot of guns centuries go by

Shambling proud and conceited
Our mission remains overcome
Anyone's freedom to be

Souls bound to fight, forced to die in inferno
Forced to kill each other, then called to life again

Souls bound to fight, forced to die in inferno
Forced to kill each other, then called to life again
Souls forced to life in eternal shame
Prowl across their hell, hiding in the shade
Of those who will send them to the slaughter

Hailing to the ones who keep them slaves
Why do we keep fomenting wars around the world?
Why do we have to split the human race in white and black?

One day we all shall have to relate
One day we all shall have to pay for our sins

Souls bound to fight, forced to die in inferno
Forced to kill each other, then called to life again
Souls forced to life in eternal shame
Prowl across their hell, hiding in the shade
