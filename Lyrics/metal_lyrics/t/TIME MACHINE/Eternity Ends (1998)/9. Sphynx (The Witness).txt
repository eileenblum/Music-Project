Here, by the river Nile
Where the gods rule on the earth
Where peace and love and the goddess' blessing
Lead the path of the just
Here the pharaohs share the wealth of wisdom
And the eternal fight carries on
Between good and bad, between holy and evil
None of them loses or wins

Lead me across the ages
Lead me across the shores
Where millennia count for minutes of never-ending time

Here, on the pyramid high
The pharaohs of steel don't exist
Here, where the children don't die
For hunger and sexual abuse

Lead me back in time to the age
This world is death and desperation
This world is subtle lies
I want to turn back in time to the age of the kings
I need to run far away from this kingdom of kills
Kills

Lead me across the ages
Lead me across the shores
Where millennia counts as minutes of never-ending time

I want to turn back in time to the age of kings
I need to run away from this kingdom of kills
Let me turn back in time to the age of the kings
Let me run far away from this kingdom of kills
