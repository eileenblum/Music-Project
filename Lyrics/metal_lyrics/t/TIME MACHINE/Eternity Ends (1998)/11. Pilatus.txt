Wash your hands and I will die,
send me straight to death;
even if I die
you won't crucify the ideals
of freedom and piece that I set
inside humanity's mind
put me on the cross
though you'll never stop
this inevitable rush for freedom
And I,
I will always live
'Cause faith will never die
when it seems to stop it begins
like returning nightmare
again and again...
Wash your hands and I will live
in history forever:
the more Jesus you kill
the more heroes you have
you can't eliminate the endless
liberty call.
History returns:
blind will follow the blind
as much as stupid mankind is,
kill me a million times and find out
I will always live
'Cause faith will never die
when it seems to stop it begins
like returning nightmare
again and again...
I will always live
'Cause faith will never die
when it seems to stop it begins
like returning nightmare
I will always live
'Cause faith will never die
when it seems to stop it begins
like returning nightmare
again and again...
