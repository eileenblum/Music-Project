Night time falls on my empire
Stars like pearls shine bright
Your smile like gold lights my desire
Staring at your eyes make me feel
Like I'm born again in silver dawn
Like loving life again

Summer storm on my emotions
Your eyes like midnight stars
Winter breeze on my hot passion
Watching you by far gives me thrill
And brings me back to daylight's blinding sheen

Like a tempest on the sea
Like a fire in the wind
Like the white of fallen snow
Like the blue of summer skies

Once again I hold your hand
Once again I trust in you
Once again I'm here to say I believe again
And only time will tell if Love can be denied
I believe again, I believe

Like a tempest on the sea
Like a fire in the wind
Like the white of fallen snow
Like the blue of summer skies

Once again I hold your hand
Once again I trust in you
Once again I'm here to say I believe again
And only time will tell if Love can be denied
I believe again, I believe

Night time falls on my empire
Stars like pearls shine bright
Your smile like gold lights my desire
Staring at your eyes makes me feel
Like I'm born again in a silver dawn
Like loving life again

Summer storm on my emotions
Your eyes like midnight stars
Winter breeze on my hot passion
Watching you by far gives me thrill
And brings me back to daylight's blinding sheen
