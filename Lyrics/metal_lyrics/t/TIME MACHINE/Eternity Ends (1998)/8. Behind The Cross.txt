Across the ocean at the very end of the sea
There's a new wild land still untouched by the beauty of our Lord and his love
On the other side of the ocean
There's a wild man still living free
And our mission's to teach him the glory of our Mother Church
And make him believe that one day
Everything shall have to change
The poor will be rich justice will rule in peace and nothing will count but our souls

At the back of the planet on the very edge of the world
There's a kingdom to establish and laws to obey and respect
The sake of mankind will make sure
Everything shall have to change
The poor will be rich, justice will rule in peace
And we shall be the ones who hide behind the wall of hidden lies

Behind the cross
Searching for new horizons
Searching for souls

I feel the doubt that mounts within
Fear winding round my soul like spiritual uneasiness
I'm aware that something's wrong
I thought I was the brave, I was the chosen one
I feel the rage that grows within
Everything now's wrong

And a thousand crates of gold will never pay for lives
We struck to death in the name of God and hid behind the cross

And the crown of king of new worlds won't justify the slaughter
Too many innocent died for progress and glory of the Church

Across the ocean on the other end of the sea
There's an old stone cold land still corrupted by evil and vice, out of grace
On the other side of the ocean
There's an old man still killing free
And his riches are due to the murdering of our new world
And he keeps on spreading the Word

Increasing his power in death
The poor will be poor and the rich will get rich
His justice will rule on us

Behind the wall of hidden lies
Behind the cross
Searching for new horizons
Searching for souls
Behind the wall of hidden lies
Behind the cross
Searching for new horizons
Searching for souls
