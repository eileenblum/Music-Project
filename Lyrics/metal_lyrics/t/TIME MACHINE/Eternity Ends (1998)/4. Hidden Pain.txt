I try to forget they nailed me to the cross
and try to forget the pain I felt inside
When desperation arose in my Mother's eyes
She stared at me with tears of blood

With tears of pain she cried for those who kill and kill again
I try to hide the pain by swallowing it when rage is driving me insane
I try to forgive a man's mistake
Even though he was aware it was my blood
It is my pain, it is my Mother's cry
That's killing me down deep again

I can see a million tears in the eyes of the world
And try to see the light at the end of the dark
Who do I have to wipe the tears from the eyes of the world?
Why do I have to love the ones who killed my soul?

Are You going to give me strength enough to live and love?
Enough to say a prayer, enough to smile again

Again, it is my pain, it kills me again
I can see a million tears in the eyes of the world
And try to see the light at the end of the dark
Who do I have to wipe the tears from the eyes of the world?
Why do I have to love the ones who killed my soul?

Again, it is my pain, it kills me again
I can see a million tears in the eyes of the world
And try to see the light at the end of the dark
Who do I have to wipe the tears from the eyes of the world?
Why do I have to love the ones who killed my soul?
