night time is falling
on the city of decay
obscurity shrouds all around me
the vision of an angel
falling down from the sky
carrying the sword of vengeance

the time is coming
time to stand high again

alone in the fight
everyone's against me
in a world that nobody wants to change
raising my arms
to invisible forces
nobody wants to ease the pain

I feel my time is coming
time to stand high again
I shall have no mercy
for The Bringer of Grief
I'll make him burn away

how will I move 
where will I stand
when the moment will come to face
the angel of death

I feel my time is coming
time to stand high again
I shall have no mercy
for The Bringer of Grief
I'll make him burn away

night time is falling
on the city of decay
obscurity shrouds all around me
the vision of an angel
falling down from the sky
carrying the sword of vengeance

I feel my time is coming
time to stand high again
I shall have no mercy
for The Bringer of Grief
I'll make him burn away
