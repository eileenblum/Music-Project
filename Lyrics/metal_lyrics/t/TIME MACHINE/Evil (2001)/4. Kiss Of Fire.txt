once again I can see your 
different faces
once again I can feel your 
evil touch

I've been fighting you for so long
now I'm meeting you again
I've been trying to escape your look
now I'm still facing your stare
your eyes, they're burning
in my mind

in the past your
name was Serpent
now it's New Economy
once I used to set fire to witches
now I track you down 
through the screen

your presence's showing
anywhere in the streets
starving children
the virus that kills
wars in the East

eyes of fire
burning deep
within souls enslaved to pleasure
eyes of fire
taking souls 
lost in the eyes of The Devil
eyes of fire 
burning deep
within souls enslaved to pleasure
eyes of fire
taking souls
lost in the eyes of The Devil
money glory and fame
that's the promise they make

in the past your
name was Serpent
now it's New Economy
once I used to set fire to witches
now I track you down 
through the screen
your presence's showing
anywhere in the streets
starving children
the virus that kills
wars in the East

eyes of fire
burning deep
within souls enslaved to pleasure
eyes of fire
taking souls 
lost in the eyes of The Devil
eyes of fire 
burning deep
within souls enslaved to pleasure
eyes of fire
taking souls lost in the eyes of The Devil
