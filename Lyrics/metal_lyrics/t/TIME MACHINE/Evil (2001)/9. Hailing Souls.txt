hear the voices
of millinos screaming souls
the battle is over
the angels rejoice and rest
a new day now can be dawning
upon the city of decay
The Army of the Dead 
is fading away
into the skyline
freedom is set 
the horizon is turning blue again
the Triumph of Good
the Victory of Love
open The Gate of Heaven

the Legions of Faith rise again
hailing to Heaven
the Legions of Light strike again
hail to The King

prophets of death, priests of The Evil
back in the shame of their burning well
calling the sovereign of darkness eternal
are now eating dust in Hell

begging their lord 
feeding their greed again
The Devil is dead, The Virgin is back
to open The Gates
of Heaven

the Legions of Faith rise again
hailing to Heaven
the Legions of Light strike again
hail to the King of Heaven

the Legions of Faith rise again
hailing to Heaven
the Legions of Light strike again
hail to The King...
