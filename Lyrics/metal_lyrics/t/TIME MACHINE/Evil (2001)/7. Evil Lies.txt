lost in the "time zero"
back from the shade
an armoured angel set me in the future
my target he said is controlling the Web
where Evil rules
reaching souls in a frame

take me I'll be your delight for a day
I'll make you forget all your trouble
you can't resist the call from within 
love drive is fine, can't take it for sin

now temptation is everywhere
there's freedom to choose
perdition or death

hear smoother words of sin
lies of The Evil arise from within
feel the charming touch of shame
whispers of lust are calling me again

right on the edge of the abyss
I stand with a cross in my hands

leave your illusion behind and touch me
there's no fault in falling within

now temptation is everywhere
there's freedom to choose
perdition or death

hear smoother words of sin
lies of The Evil arise from within
feel the charming touch of shame
whispers of lust are calling me again

lux eterna
humanae glorie
tenebrarum rex
aliger daemon
aliger daemon

filth as wildfire of shame everywhere
life has no value compared to gain
weapons and bodies
out there for the trade
crossing the borders
of legal Swiss banks

now temptation is everwhere
there's freedom to choose
perdition or death

hear smoother words of sin
lies of the evil arise from within
feel the charming touch of shame
whispers of lust are calling me again

hear smoother words of sin
lies of the evil arise from within
feel the charming touch of shame
whispers of lust are calling me again
