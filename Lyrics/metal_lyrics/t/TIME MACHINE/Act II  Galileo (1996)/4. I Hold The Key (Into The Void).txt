I fight against my darkest fears
And try to lead myself
Towards a major step in life
And expand my universe
Bound to get the best of life
Working hard all day and night
All Iâm working for is fame
All is there for me

No religion to believe in
No rules to abide by
No shadows on my faith
Iâm sure I need no help!
Humbleness is not for me
Can anybody lead me to the light?

I know the secrets of the night
Iâve got the power
I hold the key

Simple life is not for me
I deserve much more
Than any ordinary man
Iâm the chosen one
I know whatâs behind the door
I know what weâre living for!

I know the secrets of the night
Iâve got the power
I hold the key
