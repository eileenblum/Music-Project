âStand and deliver yourself to the authority
Stand, the trial is to beginâ

âYouâve gone much too farâ

âStop him! Kill him!â

âHow dare you to challenge the Church?!â

âYour behaviour and your blasphemous ideas
shocked the common sense!â

The holy writings say it all
The reason why Iâm accused
Is surely not the sun
Iâm rejecting your clichÃ©
I wonât fall into your grind machine

âThe imputationâs heresyâ

âSatanic doctrine!â

âYou attempt to undermine our societyâs rules!â

Your sentence was conceived a long time before
Against everyone whose belief is not quite like yours

The holy writings say it all
The reason why Iâm accused
Is surely not the sun
Iâm rejecting your clichÃ©
I wonât fall into your grind machine
