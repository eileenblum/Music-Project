Freedom now is just a memory of youth
When my future seemed to be in my hands
A thousand dreams now fade
As I discover this new world
And the cage of reality is suffocating me

All I do is pray
And my days keep passing by
Searching for a new horizon
Another world to start a brand new life
Where I can forget my mistakes

Still I wonât surrender as long as Iâm alive
I know if I go on mysteries unfold
My inner strength will bring me
Back to the light

Of a new dawn of wisdom and faith
Make my sun always shine

In a new day of wisdom and faith
Make my star always shine

Centuries ago someone left a sign
We should follow until we reach the truth
Someone now is saying nothing can be true
But the laws they write and we obey
