Day turns in to night
The light of hope shimmers
Weak and pale
Held here to be judged
Isolation kills deep inside

Itâs not a man that I believe in
Itâs not an idol made of stone
Itâs Love, itâs more
These four walls
Are closing in onto me

Being different to be condemned
Power games
To save the System someone has to pay
Criminal thoughts from a dissident mind
The Academy doesnât allow anyone
To place any doubt

Iâm that someone they call rebel
Arrogant and proud Iâll always be
Prisoner of dreams
