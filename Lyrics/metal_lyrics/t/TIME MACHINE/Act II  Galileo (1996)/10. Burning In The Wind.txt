Inquisitionâs got me
Accusing me of conspiracy
They never see me in church
âWe know you donât believeâ
Theyâre all masters
Theyâre all servants
They all betray each other
They always obey, politely submissive

Theyâre all clever intellectuals
They would sell their soul
For a higher rank in society
Their devotion to the wheel
If I donât do what they say
Iâll be burning on the cross

Now the cross is standing tall
Waiting for witchesâ repentance
Burning in the wind
Is religion supposed to kill
The ones who just dare to disagree?
Does religion kill?
I must pay the toll
I donât deserve forgiving for my sins
Kneel to society!
The cross is standing tall

Theyâre all clever intellectuals
They would sell their soul
For a higher rank in society
Their devotion to the wheel
If I donât do what they say
Iâll be burning on the cross

Burning in the wind
