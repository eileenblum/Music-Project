Is this a trick my mind plays?
This darkness in my head,
I don't understand.

Trapped, between these black walls
No such a beam of light
At this cold and painful night

A chance, I've been waiting for a chance
To save me, to take me away
To let me out of this hell

A voice, a strange voice I hear
But I'm all alone in my shell
So it's just in my head
It must be in my head
Just in my head

The deepest voice you used to hear sometimes,
Just try to understand its call
Maybe it's the key to the cell of your soul
Maybe that leads to your dreams.

Hope, this voice it gives me hope
To escape, to free my mind
From this void that makes me blind.

It's time, it's time for me to wake
To return to my old self.
The roads that I've made
Are just in my head.
Just in my head.

The deepest voice you used to hear sometimes,
Just try to understand its call
Maybe it's the key to the cell of your soul
Maybe that leads to your dreams

You have to reach out and reclaim your life,
Embrace all...

The deepest voice you used to hear sometimes,
Just try to understand its call
Maybe it's the key to the cell of your soul
Maybe that leads to your dreams.
