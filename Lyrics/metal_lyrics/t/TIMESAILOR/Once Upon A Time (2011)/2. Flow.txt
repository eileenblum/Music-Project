Setting free my mind, disposing of everything inside my head
All my afflictions, all my exultations.

Just look at horizon destroying the crimson sun once again
They are taking one more day from my life.

Why tell me why
Are you taking away my moments from me
Just tell me is this a revenge
But what have I done to you?

You know life's a game that everyone has to play, no other choice
You can't command to time, so stop complaining and just play the game.

Why tell me why
Are you taking away my moments from me
Just tell me is this a revenge
But what have I done to you

Time is killing you so softly but you never feel it.
Beguiled by tomorrows, it has been a nightmare for you all the time.
And the time never forgives you.

Stop questioning the time, you must play by its rules.
No! This is not a game to play; I just have one life to live

This is the rule of nature since from the dawn of life
The flow of time is flawless, no change can be applied
Life seems so short for humans; they think itâs not enough
What they donât understand is, balance of time and life

Why tell me why
Are you taking away my moments from me
Just tell me is this a revenge
But what have I done to you

Why tell me why
Are you taking away my moments from me
Just tell me is this a revenge
But what have I done to you
(The only thing you need to do is thinking how to live your life
You canât control the flow of life; youâre not a sailor of time)
