[Part I - The Experiment - Nightmares of The Past]

[Goddess:]
Iâve created all living things equal
Without a second chance to live the same moment, or see the moment theyâll live
Only I can change the timeline, alter their lives
But what if some of them had that power?
Letâs see if they can handle a gift like that
Let the experiment beginâ¦

[Dreamwalker:]
Another troubling night, dreams full of agony
Feels like the mistakes of my past are haunting me
My dreams are disturbed with sadness and pain

[Goddess:] Remember your mistakes, live your past

[Dreamwalker / Goddess:]
I canât (You can) change what Iâve done before
Why do I (Soon you will) have to face them?
Iâve made my (There is no) peace and closed that door
Never (It's time) to remember them

[Part II - The Gift]

[Dreamwalker:]
Strange things are happening
One by one
Iâm seeing the faces in my dreams
Day by day
Iâm living the scenes for the second time
Maybe this is a gift, a power to see the future.
But why those painful memories are haunting all my dreams
I see my future and my past
Can it be that I can alter them?

[Goddess:]
Understand the aim of your power

[Dreamwalker / Goddess:]
The chance to see the time ahead
Is this gift (This gift's not) all about that?
Unlock the past, redeem myself (yourself)
Letâs see if I (you) can do that

[Part III â Time to Rise]

[Beloved:]
A love that grows every day, but never ages
A feeling so deep, it touches my soul
Beloved &amp; [Dreamwalker:]
A bond so strong
Making me yours once and for all

[Dreamwalker:]
I will always be your guide
Walking with you on your every path
Beloved &amp; [Dreamwalker:]
I will always be your light
Shining on your every night

[Dreamwalker:]
All is understood at last
With this power I can fix my past
By correcting all of my mistakes
I start each day
With a cleaned stain from my life
By fixing all the faults Iâve got
First with the mistakes Iâve done to her
Now itâs all set

[Goddess:]
To begin with redemption, itâs a good start
Confront the failures, make them right

[Dreamwalker / Goddess:]
First with the dearest, purify the faults I (you) got
Making my (your) future with her bright.

[Dreamwalker:]
Also I can
See the future
Live the same moment twice
A time traveler, only with the limitation of dreams
Why do I have this power? Is there a price?

[Goddess:]
To question his gift, itâs a natural response
If you use it right, thereâll be no price

[Dreamwalker / Goddess:]
Enough with the reasons, nowâs the time for me (you) to rise
In front of me (you), the timeline lies

[Dreamwalker:]
How exciting I can shape my destiny
A perfect life for her and me
I own this power, only I have the key
To control my fate and become free

I donât need anyone
I can do this on my own
Part IV â The Change in Him

[Beloved:]
All these years, side by side
He never hurt me, never lied
He always knew what I wanted
He loved, he protected, he cared for me

But lately he has changed
I can see it in his eyes
A hint of madness. Why?
Day by day, heâs losing his love

[Part V â Last Warning]

[Dreamwalker:] Where am I? What kind of a dream is this?
[Goddess:] This is a dream you canât control
[Dreamwalker:] Who are you? How can you haunt my dreams?
[Goddess:] I am the one who gave you your gift. Don't worry my gifted child, I am not haunting you. I am here to show you your mistakes

[Dreamwalker:]
I have no mistakes
I have corrected them all
My past is clean
Itâs time for perfect future

[Goddess:]
To create a life, by yourself
This is your biggest mistake

[Dreamwalker:]
This gift is given to me
I donât need anybody

[Goddess:]
Your selfishness will be your doom
Itâll be over for you very soon
This power will be your downfall
If you donât realize your faults

[Dreamwalker:]
My downfall, my doom, impossible. Nothing bad can come out from this power. Perfect future, mistake? I donât think so.

What is the point of this gift?
If I donât use it for myself
I donât want anybody
I still have her with me

[Goddess:]
I thought he could handle his gift
With these thoughts his fall will be swift

[Dreamwalker:]
I healed every single pain
That I have caused to her
Iâll always know her needs
Sheâll always be with meâ¦

[Goddess:]
His selfishness brought his end near
He has failed my experiment

[Part VI â Out of Control]

[Instrumental]

[Part VII â Broken Bonds]

[Beloved:]
Please my love
Talk to me, open your heart
Lift the mist that surrounds your mind

[Dreamwalker:]
Donât worry my love
There is nothing wrong with me
My life is perfect, donât you see?

[Dreamwalker &amp; Beloved:]
Thereâs nothing (something) wrong with me (you),
Iâm not (you are) different than before, I havenât (you have) changed

[Beloved:]
You deceive yourself
Your life is not perfect
You have lost all your friends and your family

[Dreamwalker:]
I donât care about neither of them
If I have you by my side
I have the power to give us perfect future

[Beloved:]
Your pride has been cloaking your mind
You lost your love, you left your old self behind
Our bond is broken without our love
I have tried to fix it until now
Iâm tired now; itâs time for us to part
Farewell my love, you will always be in my heart

[Part VIII â Redemption â The Tale of Dreamwalker]

[Dreamwalker:]
This dream was the worst one Iâve had
With her gone, Iâm all alone and sad
Now I can see, why this is a mistake
My pride blinded me, I need to wake
It does not matter if my life is perfect
If thereâs no one to share it, itâs all fake
The gift was never the power itself
But the happiness it brings
If Iâll help only myself
It will only bring loneliness upon me.

[Goddess:] At last he understood his duty
[Dreamwalker:] Use this power for everyoneâs good
[Goddess:] The healing will begin in reality
[Dreamwalker:] Undo the mistakes Iâve made
[Goddess:] Starting with his most loved one
[Dreamwalker:] First Iâll save my love
[Goddess:] Then all the others he caused pain
[Dreamwalker &amp; Goddess:] My new (his) life starts right now

[Dreamwalker:]
Without breaking the bonds I had
I didnât realize my acts are wrong
[Goddess:] (He could not handle the power alone)

[Goddess:]
The fear of losing his most beloved
Opened the fog that closed his mind
[Dreamwalker:] (To earn this power, great love is needed)

[Goddess:]
The experiment is not failed nor succeeded
I still have answers I need to findâ¦
[Dreamwalker:]
Iâll redeem myself and use this gift
For everyoneâs sake
(An unknown future ahead)

[Dreamwalker &amp; Goddess:]
The tale of dreamwalker beginsâ¦
