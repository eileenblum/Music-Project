Wait, oh wait just a little while
Soon as he comes you're gonna die
With a little cleaver he makes mince of you
From your eyes he'll create aspic too

Watch out, beware of his assistant
Watch out, take care and listen
Watch out, you'll never see the sun again
Watch out, you will be cut in two

Whooohooohohohoooo - Blood on the ground
Whooohooohohohoooo - A knife makes no sound
Whooohooohohohoooo - The reaper's laughin' now
Whooohooohohohoooo - Dying in a small amount

He's living at Red Row Number 8
He killed so many but not only at night
You're gonna stay buried in his little chamber
Tomorrow your bloody cloth will fit another

Watch out, beware of his assistant
Watch out, take care and listen
Watch out, you'll never see the sun again
Watch out, you will be cut in two
