Through all the last years parents were wondering
Start living your own way, boy grows to a man
Schools out, the sun is shining, your shirt back to front
Everyone is starring at you cos you are the one

Condemned to fire, Condemned to fire, Condemned to fire

All your friends right from the start are still around
Debating 'bout the holocaust, about the red and brown
It's so freaky cool being with your 'lil nazi boys
No one has any doubt you gonna use your toy!

Condemned to fire - aim and pull the trigger 
Condemned to fire - shoot to kill, shoot to kill, yeah!
Condemned to fire - are you feeling better
Condemned to fire - hope you're gonna burn in hell

By the time you're growing old but the fire still exists
No one recognized you, no one's left to kill
It's always happening if madness grows in men
But nip things in the bud, beware of the damned!
