Welcome to the depths of our world
Welcome to all of those familiar sounding words
Such a long time we were searching for the key
To believe is worth fighting for
If you all are wondering, if you all start listening
We'll tell you where have been, we'll make you see what we are

We're forged in hell's fire - proven by good and bad
We're forged in hell's fire - the blood, the sweat and tears
We're forged in hell's fire - the game is back on track
We're forged in hell's fire - the blade is coming back!

Watch out, beware of the pretenders
Watch out, take care cos they love to see you fail
If they are wondering, if they stopped listening
We'll tell them where we have been, we'll make them see what we are
