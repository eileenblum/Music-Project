When daylight is gone and all evil sleeps
On top of a mountain we're stand
Touched by a warm summer breeze

We stare into space, stare into dark - look at the stars
We stare into space, with ache in our hearts - look at the universe

Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
The killing rays - The evil in disguise!
Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
What science never told, it's end of our lives
Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
The killing rays - The evil in disguise!
Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
What science never told, it's end of our lives

When the lights are dimmed in the valley
The eagle stops its crying call
Halted by a glittering ray

We stare into space, stare into dark - look at the stars
We stare into space, with ache in our hearts - look at the universe

Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
The killing rays - The evil in disguise!
Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
What science never told, it's end of our lives
Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
The killing rays - The evil in disguise!
Whooohhhhohohohoo Whooohhhhohohohoo
What science never told, it's end of our lives

So many times we're thinking 'bout ourselves
So many times we're clinging to our aim
Just complaining 'bout all the hard times
Just complaining 'bout all the pain
We spread our hate, we spread our disease
We only regret what we don't need
Just in the end, when it's too late
We regret it again and again again and again!
