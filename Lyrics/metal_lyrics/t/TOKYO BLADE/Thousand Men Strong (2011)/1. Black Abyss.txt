You've opened all the books of good and evil
You've read the lines and learned all the deadly rhymes
In your mind you always have been there to give them
A great laughter 'bout their stupid way of life

Welcome to the black abyss - no truth instead of the sirens kiss
Welcome to the black abyss - welcome home again!
Welcome to the black abyss - no truth instead of the sirens kiss
Welcome to the black abyss - welcome home again!

How many times your efforts were not good enough
Cos you're learnt that you're just another part of a lower class
In your morbid imagination it's time to raise the dagger
An evil spell, a flashing blade fits for justice so much better

Welcome to the black abyss - no truth instead of the sirens kiss
Welcome to the black abyss - welcome home again!
Welcome to the black abyss - no truth instead of the sirens kiss
Welcome to the black abyss - satan is watchin' you!
