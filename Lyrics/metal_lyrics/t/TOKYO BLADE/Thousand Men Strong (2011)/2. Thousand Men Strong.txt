In 1519: two of thirteen had survived 
As the ruthless conquistador CartÃ©s arrived 
All that he needed was a cheap and helping hand
To subject YucatÃ n, to steal their gold, to bear a deadly plan
His troops are coming closer, armour glistens in the sun
You're frightened by their horses, deadly thunder by their guns

Get on your feet and fight the enemy
Like thousand men strong - till their barrier crumbles down

In 1561: the evil forced its way
The friar game, the end is near, you'll never be the same
He'll burn down your religion and throw away your pride
If you do not make a stand, you soon gonna die
His troops are coming closer, armour glistens in the sun
You're frightened by their horses, deadly thunder by their guns 

Get on your feel and fight the enemy
Like thousand men strong - till their barrier crumbles down
Get on your feel and fight the enemy
Like thousand men strong - Death is still around
