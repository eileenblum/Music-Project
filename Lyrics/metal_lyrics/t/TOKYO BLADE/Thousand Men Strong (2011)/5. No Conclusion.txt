I've always had that feeling inside of me
I always thought that there could be so much more to see
We're at that certain point with our backs to the wall
One step forward, two steps back isn't working anyone

The situation stays the same

No conclusion - don't speak anymore
No conclusion - mind's taking control
No conclusion - no more harm to feel
...this is our end!

Now you're sitting many miles away, but next to me
Starting a lame conversation, with the useless word "indeed"
Asking me how I am, and telling me you're done find
Luck on me, you're gone, the wheel is turning on and on

There is no one left to blame

No conclusion - don't speak anymore
No conclusion - mind's taking control
No conclusion - no more harm to feel
...this is our end!
