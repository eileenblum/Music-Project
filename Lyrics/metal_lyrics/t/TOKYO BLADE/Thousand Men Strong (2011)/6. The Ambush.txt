Gaslight is flashing, an old man shuffles in the black
Susurration behind you, you fear the attack
You turn around but no one's there; blood is pulsating
A pocket watch strikes midnight; the call of the raven

Dense fog is covering the slimy cobblestone
The smell of blood is in the air the inner fear: no mourn
He told you to come (over) here to that scary place
A stabbing pain slashes you, sweat runs down your face

The Thames flows placid, the falling tide is on
The morning has broken, the buzzing voices gone
Daylight now is showing us, what lies behind all fears
A bloody-minded story, a crime a loss with tears
