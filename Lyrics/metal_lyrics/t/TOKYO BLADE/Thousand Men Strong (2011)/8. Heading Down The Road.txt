The critics were always there and a part of our lives
There's always someone who's paying a much lower price

But being the cheap jack isn't a clever way
This is what we've learnt since the early days

Heading down the road - we're ready to start now 
Heading down the road - we're gonna rock you down

Money-sucker everywhere, monkey business, living hell!
They stab you in the back if there's nothing left to tell

If your 15-minute-fame has come to an end
There's no one left just your buddies from the band

Heading down the road - we're ready to start now 
Heading down the road - we're gonna rock you down
Heading down the road - we're ready to start now 
Heading down the road - we're gonna rock you down
