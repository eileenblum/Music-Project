[Boulton/Wright]

She smiles at me
Undercover of a cigarette
I'm alone in the cool night
Trying to forget

[Bridge]
The flame of passion
Is burning in my heart
Blue moon rising
Another shot in the dark

[Chorus]
Dancing in blue moonlight
The splendour of the night overshadows the day
Dancing in blue moonlight
Let the morning carry you away

Steal away
To a place that we both know
Surrender to the moon and the sirens tune
When the fire's burning low

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
