[Boulton/Wright]

Kiss the bride and make her cry
Sugar daddy sold her an alibi
The bridal gown was of second hand lace
You should have seen her mothers face

[Bridge]
On lovers lane we had a hell of a time
The sex police call it a crime
You can run from the system
Stumble and fall
It's all or nothing or nothing at all

[Chorus]
Undercover honeymoon
Secrets in a motel room
Undercover honeymoon
Who said I was a loony tune

Champagne serenade
Brahms and Lizst in the cool of the shade
With a side step shuffle
I was back for more
Walking like a sailor like ship to shore

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
