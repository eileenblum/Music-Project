[Boulton/Wright]

Monkeys blood running through my veins
Funky junkies with babies brains
Sticking needles in the heart of the city
Little girls who once were pretty

[Chorus]
Ooh baby! It hurts so good
Hallelujah!
I got monkeys blood
I got monkeys blood

Vaccination is a four letter word
Perspiration from a small town turd
Jungle Jimmy is a high school retard
Sexy Suzy's on a picture postcard

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
