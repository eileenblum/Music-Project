[Boulton/Wiggins/Wright]

You captured love in your every motion
I'm sinking fast in your lonely ocean
You're a siren of the night
And I'm sailing to your light
To your light...

The one and only in a slow motion dream
This love of ours will never fade away
I call to you with a silent scream
Stay with me for another day

[Bridge]
I'm cloud cruising when I'm in your arms
You took me in with your feline charms
You hit me low, that's a physical thing
You got a tongue like a scorpion sting

[Chorus]
Can we make it (Make it) through the night
Is it real or just s dream
Can we make it (Make it) through the night
Together, we're gonna be alright

We keep running but we go nowhere
You move me but you're standing still
We take it slow and then we're there
Take a step at a time to the top of the hill

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
