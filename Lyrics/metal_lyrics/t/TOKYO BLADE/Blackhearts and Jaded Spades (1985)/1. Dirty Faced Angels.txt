[Boulton/Wright]

They blind your mind
You're mama's blued eyed boy
They make you eat something
That you don't enjoy

[Bridge]
I heard the thunder as I fell from the sky
Too young to worry and to old to cry
The sound of the city is a lonely song
The broke my wings and said I didn't belong

[Chorus]
Angels! Dirty Faced Angels
Angels! Fallen far from grace
Angels! Dirty faced angels
Angels! Broken wings are gonna get me down

Got a fractured halo
I'm the prodigal son
I'm a social cancer
I'm on the business end of this gun

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
