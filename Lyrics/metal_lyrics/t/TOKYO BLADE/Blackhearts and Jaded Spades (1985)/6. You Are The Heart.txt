[Boulton/Wright]

Maybe I can find a way of saying
That your love still shines for me and lights the way
And you're closer to my heart
I hear you calling
Two worlds apart
So close and far away

[Bridge]
Well I'll catch when you fall
I'll be there when you call
When you're drowning in your tears
Don't hide behind your fears

[Chorus]
You are the heart
You are the soul
You are the song
We'll come together now
We will be strong
You are the heart
You are the soul
You are the song
The past is over
So let's carry on

Standing hand in hand we are united
Together we're the hope inside the song

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
