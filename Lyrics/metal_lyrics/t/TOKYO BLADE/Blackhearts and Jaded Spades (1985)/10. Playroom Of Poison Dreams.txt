[Boulton/Wright]

Carousel of story time
Children slumber in distant rhymes
Sleepwalk of the living dead
The rocking horse rears it's head

Midnight masquerade
Tin soldiers on parade
A chill sweeps the children's room
Colder than their mothers womb

[Chorus]
In the playroom of poison dreams
I hear the children's poison screams
The mystery is burning on and on

[Bridge]
We see the truth inside the lie
I'm the spider, you're the fly
The children see the meaning of the song
And what's wrong, yeah

Shadows fall across the wall
A toy soldier bugle calls
Nursery serenity
Shattered by obscenity

Puppets dance with burning strings
A china doll sits up and sings
Released from the statues stance
Reborn in human form

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Solo]

Whoa - whoa - oh oh
