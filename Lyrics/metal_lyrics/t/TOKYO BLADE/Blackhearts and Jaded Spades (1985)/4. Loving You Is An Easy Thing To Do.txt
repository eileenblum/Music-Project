[Boulton/Wright]

I ain't talking about love baby
I ain't talking jive
I saw your reflection in my beer glass
You were trying to stay alive

[Bridge]
We were made for each other
Never be another
Oh it's just those simple things
That get me ready to roll

[Bridge]
Lovin' you is an easy thing to do
I never knew you felt the same way too

The way you move just drives me crazy
You're a smooth operator
You're dancing, romancing
There's no second chancing
Your love bites like an alligator

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
