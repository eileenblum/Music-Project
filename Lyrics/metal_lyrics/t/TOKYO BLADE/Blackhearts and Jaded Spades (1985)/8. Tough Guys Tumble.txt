[Boulton/Wright]

A little girl on a street corner
Worth nothing with diamond eyes
A little boy who lives in a nightmare
Daddy's gonna feed him the tears he cries

[Bridge]
A thousand broken dreams
Running through my mind
We'll rise above the screams
We'll be cruel to be kind

[Chorus]
When the tough guys tumble
The city's gonna rumble
When the tough guys tumble
The city's gonna rumble

A lullaby song for the children
He's the star of the story, is a circus clown
He's the guy with s chip on his shoulder
He's the guys that's running the town

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
