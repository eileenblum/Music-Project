[Boulton/Wright]

I never made it past the bedroom door
I was stone cold sober when I hit the Floor
I didn't want it to happen like this
You shot me down with a laser kiss

[Bridge]
I felt it coming, I got a clue in my shoe
Well I'll always love you no matter what you do

[Chorus]
'Cos I'll always
Always love you
'Cos I'll always
Always Love you

Another town and another face
I left my heart beating in a suitcase
I didn't want it to happen like this
You shot me down with a laser kiss

[Bridge]
[Solo]
