[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

You don't like the way I look
You don't like the company I keep
You spend your whole life planning my character assassination

You'd link hands across the ocean
But you wont link hands with me, your brother

This is what I am- take it or leave it
The is what you get - you'd better believe it
Ain't gonna compromise - ain't gonna do it
This is what I am - take it or leave it

You cant break down your barriers
No model citizen but who the hell is
Its still my country and I'll do what I believe in
Get down off my back 'cos I ain't just like you

shake hands with the devil for a profit
But you wont spare a dime for me you mutha

I am what I am
I am what you made me
