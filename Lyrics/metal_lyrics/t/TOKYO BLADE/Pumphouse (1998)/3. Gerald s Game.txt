[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

I could do better than that
Don't need no wise ass telling me I'm wasting my time
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
When it comes right down, we're all the same

I remember it well, just about 16
Dad said what you gonna do with your life
No sweat, no problem, don't you worry about me
When I get old I know what I want to be

[Bridge]
Would I lie to you
Would I lie to you

[Chorus]
We bear the scars from Gerald's game
He names his price you sign your name
He's gone to hell, ain't that a shame
No one can win at Gerald's game

Who is the hero, who is the villain
Who is who, who do we think we are
Its a mixed up, screwed up, fucked up world
We wish you well but hope you fall

I remember it well like only yesterday
don't seem to matter, do it anyway
no pain, no gain, luck don't come for free
I'm your friend, put your trust in me

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]

Would I lie to you [x4]
