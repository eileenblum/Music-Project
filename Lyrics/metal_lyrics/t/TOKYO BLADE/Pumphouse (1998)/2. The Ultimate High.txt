[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

I've been here, I've been there, I've tried everything everywhere
I've done this, I've tried that, I'm an adrenaline junkie
I've hung here, I am experienced, I've tasted it I swear
Been there, seen that, tried it, done it, yeah that too

Like a moth that dances with the fire
Can't resist the flame
What is the ultimate high
What price to take you higher

[Bridge]
Such a killer rush
Touch a killer rush
Feel the killer rush
What goes up comes down

[Chorus]
What do you do to make you feel good
What do you do to make you feel good
What do you do

I've been high, I've been low, been everywhere in-between
I've felt good, I've felt bad, felt everything that I could
I've been to the top, I've been to the edge, where do I go from here
Been there, seen that, tried it, done it, yeah that too

We dance, we party, are we puppets held by burning string
What is the ultimate high
Some get up, but not back down

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Do you feel the rush
Can you feel the rush
Do you feel the rush
Do you feel it

[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
