[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

Working for the company, working 8 to 5
Working for every hour, I just cant work it out
Boss don't even know my name, don't even pretend to care
Won't someone tell me what's it all about?

[Bridge#1]
Oh yeah, everybody wants it
I know everybody needs it
We cant just live without it, material world
We want it all 
Gimme gimme gimme more more more

[Chorus]
1, 2, buckle my shoe, everybody knows the score
It's only money, money
3, 4, Knock on my door, everybody wants some more
It's only money, money

My house is bigger than your house, I've got the biggest car
Got everything but what money cannot buy
Stand in your suit of gold but money don't make you the man
Chill factor zero, cant take it when you die

[Bridge#2]
Work hard for the mighty dollar
Give me, give me just a little more
We just can't live without it, material world
We want it all
Gimme gimme gimme more more

[Chorus]

One law for the rich, another one for the poor
It's I'm alright jack, you'd better work harder
Harder

[Solo]
[Chorus]
