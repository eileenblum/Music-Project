[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

You don't have to be that smart to get a real good job working at the top
Say its tough just cant stop it, another pinstriped pencil neck
Say his shits together man, its set to run forever

Out here in the real world, we dance to looney tunes
Out here in the real world we get on down to the looney tunes

Hey I got a good idea
Get that wise guy out the boardroom
Bossman's got his head up his aspirations
Blind lead the blind with the same neck tie
Heading for the first big prize

No more promises, no more messing around like you did at school
Welcome to the party, welcome to the nightmare
monkey runs for president
Now that's SNAFU
