[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

We do what we do
We say what we say
You don't like what we do
You know what you can do

Welcome to the party, everybody's welcome
Get on board the wagon, gotta, gotta get on
Nice suit, nice tie, damn good haircut
Please take a number gotta, gotta get in line

we do.....

Oh you cant do that cos you haven't got this
And you cant have this cos you cant do that
Everybody seems so full of it

Crying don't help you, screaming don't relieve it
Cant please everybody so you gotta please yourself
Don't like what you see dear, you don't have to be here
The man at the back said everyone attack, we are what we are

we do.......

oh you cant do that....

Same old story, slamming your head against a damn brick wall
Same old shit, I'm tired of it
You heard the man, you've got it made
we pay the price, no work, no play
