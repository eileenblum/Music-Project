[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

Such a young dude with an attitude
ain't it a shame
Crying with the pain, tired of pissing in the rain
its a shame, such a shame
Working on the line, your work is like a crime
ain't it a shame
Sing the workhouse blues, wish your life away
its a shame, such a shame

Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
want to party every night
No work, no pay, hey judgement day
All work, no play, hey Jack, no way

Work ain't a bad place to visit but who wants to live there
Work ain't a bad place to visit but who wants to live there
Nice work if you can get it

Burned out town where you're killing time
ain't it a shame
See the girls dance but you cant take a chance
its a shame, such a shame
Cant afford the ransom on the car in the shop
ain't it a shame
Drag your ass from the bed, someone living in your head
its a shame, such a shame
