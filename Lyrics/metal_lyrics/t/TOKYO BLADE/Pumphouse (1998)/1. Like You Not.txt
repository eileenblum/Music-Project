[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

Tired of this head load, pressure in the red
Ain't gonna fall into the trap set by the company yes man
Oh man, surely the clock is running slow
Teasing me, letting me know

[Bridge]
9 o'clock on a Monday morning getting those downtown flashbacks
Oh my feet are set in concrete, ain't enough time to get it on
Got to cut loose, gotta kickback

[Chorus]
We want to be like you, not
I don't want to be like you
We want to live like you, not
I don't want to be like you

Working on the ground floor, monkey on my back
Shot myself in the foot
Oh man, but I ain't alone
Oh pretty lady working out the back streets
Teasing me, says I gotta let go

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
