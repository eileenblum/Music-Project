[Lee/Marsh/Riggs]

Hot shot politician, big shot movie star, maybe a TV. hero
I wanna drive a Rolls Royce cos its got to be good for my head
You and me we dance to the beat
but somebody higher keeps changing the tune
Who's that knocking, breaking down my door
Big bad tax man wants the shirt off my back

Bad bad day
I'm having a bad day
Bad bad day
Everybody's on my back

Everybody's dreaming looking for a reason to live

You cant see the tears when you're welding in the rain
Yu and me we dance to the beat
but somebody higher keeps changing the tune
Go face the world boy, hands tied behind your back
Half assed situation ain't nothing new

Bad bad.....

A man said son, you should go far
The farther the better
If life was fair and work was luck
Then I'd be rich and who'd give a fuck...

Originally released 1998

Pumphouse was the name of the band Alan Marsh formed after the end of the Mr Ice tour. It took nearly 10 years to see it released, but as a typical record company, Zoom Club issued it as a Tokyo Blade album, when in fact, it couldn't more different.
