[Boulton/Marsh]

Bad boy, bad reputation, late nights at sleazy bars
Nobody's gonna bring that young boy down
Midnight temperature is rising, when he cuts loose he's really flying
There ain't a girl that's safe in this town

[Bridge]
Oh just one step inside the law
This dude knows he ain't gonna go to heaven

[Chorus]
Young, bad and no good
Little bit hot, a little misunderstood

Don't play by the rules but he don't care, someday there'll be a price o pay
But before that boy burns it he'll have a hell of a time
Who's the hero, who's the villain, it ain't so easy anymore
While he rocks and rolls we'll tow the line

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
