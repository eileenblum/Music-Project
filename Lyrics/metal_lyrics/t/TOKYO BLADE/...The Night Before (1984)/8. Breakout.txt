[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

Stare through the window, a cold and empty cell
Recalling all the fear I feel about this night
Time's standing still, my spirit's running low
I'm not afraid to die but I know the end's in sight

[Bridge]
Another prisoner trapped inside these walls
Tell me that I'm dreaming, I hear them call my name

[Chorus]
Danger, danger, breakout, breakout
danger, danger, breakout, breakout

Siren's screaming out, searchlights burn my eyes
My body's aching, the dogs are on my trail
Tears in my eyes, roadblocks up ahead
Somebody's screaming, the dead men tell no tales

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat chorus]
