[Boulton/Marsh]

Roll the top back, hit the road
That young boy is too well protected from the heat
(like beer in a cooler)
No time for work, it's party time
He's too busy living on easy street
(oh real good times)

Oh he's the hotshot in the city (hotshot)
Oh he's sitting pretty (oh yeah)
Messing around with the boss man's daughter
Oh he's never doing what he ought to

Poor little rich kid
Money can't buy a little thing called love
Poor little rich kid
Oh, oh no

Kick back, feel the beat
A bad attitude from living in the pleasure dome
(gotta major personality problem)
The streets are gold in credit zone
You could fill a book with his alibis
(and no lies, no charge)

Oh he's the hotshot in the city (hotshot)
Oh he's sitting pretty (oh yeah)
Messing around with the boss man's daughter
Oh he's never doing what he ought to

Poor little rich kid
Money can't buy a little thing called love
Poor little rich kid
Oh, can't get enough
Poor little rich kid
Sell anything, no deal too tough
Poor little rich kid
Oh oh no

Feel the heat, hear the crash
This rich kid's worlds about to turn to ash
Why trust you, deception all the while
Learning how to backstab and how to falsely smile

But everyone goes through it, and all the deals are all the same
Rip 'em off before they rip you, and no-one takes the blame
Reach for the radio, turn the dial
The DJ's talking about the high cost of living, that ain't living
So sad, so sad, burned out at 25

Oh living on Easy Street, dancing to the beat
Oh baby, take a seat, it's showtime
Get out of that one junior
