[Boulton/Marsh]

Run for your life, there's danger in the air
You know the fate
Can't reason why, I look into the past
But it's too late

Down on the streets, into the depths of the night
Never, never look back

[Chorus]
Fever, fever, fever
All night long
Fever, fever, fever
All night long

Dressed for the kill, blood is running hot
Again tonight
Time's running out, all hell's breaking loose
It's dynamite

Neon lights, battle fights
No one stands in the way

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
