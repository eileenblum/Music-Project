[Boulton]

Something in the way you drag me down
Started a fire then you put it out
Like a tiger in the night you start to prey
Hunter doesn't hunt 'til night turns to day

[Bridge]
You think you own me but that ain't true
You wanna beat me black and blue
I wanna bite but it's all down to you

[Chorus]
Heartbreaker leave me alone
'Cos I'm passing you by this time (heartbreaker)
Heartbreaker leave me alone
'Cos there's no way you'll never be mine

Telling my friends how you kicked me out
Lying your way all around town
You bit me like a snake and shook me to the limit
How was I to know there was poison in it

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Throw me down then pick me up
I wanna run but I can't break free
Thought you had me but I'm too tough
You're next kid ain't gonna be me
No!

[Solo]
[Chorus]

Heartbreaker!
