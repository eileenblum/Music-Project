[Boulton]

Staring through the window
Looking at another lonely day
Oh how could I forget you
And all those games we used to pay

[Bridge]
How many times did I say to myself
I'd never fall in love again
The things we say were never meant to hurt
You're breakin' up my heart

[Chorus]
These chains of love won't set me free
These chains of love keep holdin' me
I stand alone in misery
These chains of love are killin' me
These chains of love

Tell me why you're leavin'
And I will try to understand
All the lying and deceivin'
Why don't you ever show your hand

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

How many times have I loved and lost
How many times
How many times I've met the cost
Oh babe met the cost
