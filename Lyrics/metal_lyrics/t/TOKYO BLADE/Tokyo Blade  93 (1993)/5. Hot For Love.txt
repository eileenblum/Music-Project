[Boulton/Zito]

Lookin' for a lady then I met you
And never had it so bad
What am I gonna do
Tonight's the dawn
Just to drag me up
Could you save all the lies
I think I got her sussed

[Bridge]
When you kiss
When you touch
Got to like it all so much
When she smiles
And says all right
She knows the way I'm feeling 'bout her

[Chorus]
Hot for you
Hot for you tonight
I'm feeling hot for you
Hot for you tonight

Sets me up in light now
Don't delay
I need a lot of fire
In position, take aim
I will fight to survive
She'll come on by
Name her price
She got me sussed

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Its a feeling that I have
Do ya want it deep inside
This feeling I have is reaching out

[Solo]
[Chorus]
