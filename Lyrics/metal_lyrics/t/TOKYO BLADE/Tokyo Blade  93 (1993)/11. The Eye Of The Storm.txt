[Sullivan/Pozz/Pozz]

You come to our show
You're one of the living
You wanna go overdrive
ready and willin'
You reach for our hearts
Our souls and our laughter
You don't give a shit about
The morning after

As long as the free world keeps turnin' the wheels of love goin' 'round and 'round
As long as guitars kill fear and pain
we're riding the storm out

Stand Back
The eye of the storm
Stand back
Or you die alone
Stand back
Fight for paradise
Stand back
No heart's cold as ice

Come wave with your left hands
We play with the right
The audience is princess
We're kings of the night
The world's not enough
For your flaming youth
You would not be here
For a sip of juice

As long as the free...
