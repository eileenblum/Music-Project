[Razaf/Waller/Brooks]

No one to talk with, I'm all by myself
No one to talk with, I'm happy by myself
Ain't misbehavin', I'm saving my love for you

Don't stay out late, don't care to go
I'm on my bounty, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin, I'm saving my love for you

Like Jack Horner sitting in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care
Your kisses are worth waiting for

I know for certain the one thing I love
I'm through with flirting, it's you I'm thinking of
Ain't misbehavin, I'm saving all my love for you

Ain't misbehavin'
Messin' around or foolin' around...
...Oh no

That's All!
