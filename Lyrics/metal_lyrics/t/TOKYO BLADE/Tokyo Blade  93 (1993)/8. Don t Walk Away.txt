[Boulton/Zito]

Light falls again
Here I am, waiting for your lies to hurt me
But its one of your smiles that turned me around
Led me to forgive
Say you didn't mean to hurt me
And we should try again
Oh, try again

As the night closes in
Get up waiting for you
Don't want to hear those lies
Like you've read the book all through
Bedroom is where she cries
But I've seen the act before
Still I would fall for it one more time
She takes away all of my pride

[Bridge]
Its all a crazy game that we can't win
The crazy dreams we have when love begins

[Chorus]
Girl I want you, and I need you
Don't walk away and leave this don't go now
Girl I want you and I need you
Don't walk away and leave this don't go now

That night I lay awake with my heart broke in two
I pray its all a dream
Please don't tell me were through
To her, its all a game
'Cos breaking hearts never caused her no pain
Just cant admit you're still the same
You don't feel no shame

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
