[Boulton/Zito]

See your idols on the silver screens
Well you're loving every minute 'cos it don't seem real
Oh you're made for it, you live that dream
You don't really know what to feel
Keep on heading for those bright lights every night

[Bridge]
Its not too late
Its not too late

[Chorus]
Don't want no movie star
Tear down the silver screen
Don't want no movie star
Living their lives in a dream world

That Latino, oh he stole the scene
Broke a million hearts on the side of the streets
They live their lives like royalty
You know he had the power and she was the queen
Keep on heading for those bright lights every night

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
