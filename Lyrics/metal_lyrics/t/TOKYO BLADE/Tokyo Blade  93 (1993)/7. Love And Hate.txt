[Boulton/Zito]

Supposed to jump all the time
We give too much, is that a crime
These things we do spin around in my mind
I wanna know what I've got to do
In love one minute and then were through
Oh I tried so hard, tried so very hard

[Bridge]
Got to give it time
Either way its war
Always crossing the line
Maybe one more time

[Chorus]
Love and hate
On the borderline
Love and hate
Such a thin line
Love and hate
On the borderline
Love and hate

Always so easy to fight with you
Got the scars to prove it too
Once you cross that line, you've gotta hold on to your pride
Mixed up feelings, that's true
Raw emotions rising too
Oh foolish pride, never say never again

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
