[Boulton/Zito]

I found a note that you left me, said we were through
I tried to get through girl, a message to you
Lack of communication now started too
The past is behind us, lets start new

[Bridge]
I came to find you here in this lonely place (lonely place)
In this town you call your home, yeah I'll find you
Oh - oh - o - oh

[Chorus]
As the sun goes down here in Tokyo City
Call your name out loud here in Tokyo City

Standing alone in the city, searching for you
Not gonna go looking for clues
I swore I saw you, I called out your name
I felt a true fool when it wasn't you

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
