[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

I don't know why people act this way
I don't know why people lie to your face
Following you, following me, following everyone
Shady politician with his head up his ass
Tells you all your troubles ain't to do with class
It's been so long, been so long, since I had trust in you

You know it's a crime, oh we're all way out of line
You know it's a crime, oh we're all way out of line

Crime by TV, crime by what you see, crime by watching me
Crime 'cos you believe
Crime by TV, terrorvision screen
Crime 'cos you can't see what is make believe

No grey, just black and white
The same old macho sight
It's such a pity, it's such a pity
Yeah, I've got a head full of bad wiring

I've got to kill that mutha before he kills we
We all made mistakes, where the hell's the give and take
Its been so long, been so long, singing that looney tune
Wrapped around your power like a venomous snake
How can we talk to a two sided face
Monkey see what monkey do, monkey got out of the cage
