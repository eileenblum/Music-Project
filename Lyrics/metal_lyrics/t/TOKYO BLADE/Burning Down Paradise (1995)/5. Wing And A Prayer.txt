[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

Two hearts beating as one
But it just ain't enough oh oh
Wipe those tears from your eyes
You knew when we started things would be tough oh oh

Late at night when you think you're alone
I can hear you crying in the darkness
Can't let our love die forever
We've got to hold on

Stop (stop) livin' a lie
We'll make it on a wing and a prayer
We've got to hold on 'cos we got love
Yeah everybody's hero
Stop (stop) livin' a lie
We'll make it on a wing and a prayer

When dreams have been broken you feel it's the end
Wish you'd never begun oh oh
I can't try any harder
You're pushing too hard
Seems there's nowhere to run
