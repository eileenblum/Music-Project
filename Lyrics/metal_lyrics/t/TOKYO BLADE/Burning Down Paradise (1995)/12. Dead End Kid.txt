[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

Young boy say you got a bad attitude
A problem child, a creature of a mis-spent youth
On Monday morning you're working the protection line
The bossman tells you your hair is way too long

(You're a dead end kid)

But every evening that's when the day begins
You and the boys kick hard into the heart of town
Cool beer and the girls are so pretty
Party on 'til the dead of night
Nothin' gonna get you down

[Bridge]
You want to touch (you wanna touch)
You want to feel it deep inside
You're a loaded gun (loaded gun)
Oh life pulls the trigger (bang bang)
It's shot you down in flames (shot you down in flames

[Chorus]
Who shot (shot down with a bullet to the heart)
But you ain't gonna die, it's just the edge of the blade
Ain't gonna cry livin' close to the edge
But it's hard (but it's hard) labelled dead end kid

burned out town where you think you're killing time
Young and restless you teed a place to unwind
Everybody says you don't care about nothin'
It's jungle law
You're an animal with its first taste of blood

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Oh you're a dead end kid
A dead end kid oh yeah
Think you've got all the answers
But you ain't going nowhere

[Solo]
[Chorus]
