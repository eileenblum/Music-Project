[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

My head is spinning, my ears keep ringing
What is it all about (ain't that a bitch)
It ain't no party, I'm so screwed up
I don't know who to blame (ain't that a bitch)
It's Monday morning, I'm pissed with work
I got the downtime flashbacks (ain't that a bitch)

[Bridge]
Well it's a dirty life but someone's got to live it
Well it's a dirty life but someone's got to live it
It ain't over 'til it's over
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings

[Chorus]
Kickback (kickback) with a little bit of rock 'n' roll
(kickback) 'cos a little of what you like
(kickback) never did any harm
Kickback (kickback) oh loosen up a bad head
(kickback) I'm gonna do it anyway
(kickback) don't want ya knocking on my backdoor

Party with the devil got my ass on the line
Everybody wants a piece of me (ain't that a bitch)
If you sleep with dogs when you wake up in the morning
Got to live with the fleas (ain't that a bitch)
I got real close to this real hot looker
Then she named her price (ain't that a bitch)

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]

It ain't over 'til it's over
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
Don't piss down my back tell me it's raining

[Chorus]
