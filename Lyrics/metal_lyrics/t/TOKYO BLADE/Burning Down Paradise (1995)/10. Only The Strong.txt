[Boulton/MarshWiggins]

Looking back down over all these years
Well it seems like yesterday
We didn't have much, we didn't need much
And we did things our own way

Teacher tried, soon had to realize
We were exceptions to the rule
And we learned more down on London's streets
Than we ever learned in school

[Chorus]
And we were strong, and only the strong survive
And we were strong, and only the strong survive

Remember when we were young
Times were hard and we played it tough
And we got caught between the fire and flame

It was so many years ago and nothin' lasts forever
Another lesson learned
On oh, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive

I can still recall all those smokey halls
Where we spent so many nights
It was a hard life, but we didn't care
'Cos what we faced we faced it together

No masquerade we were renegades
There can be no regrets
This town has changed, those days are lost
Still  we never will forget

Remember when we were young
Times were hard and we played it tough
And we got caught between the fire and flame

It was so many years ago and nothin' lasts forever
Another lesson learned
On oh, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive

[Chorus]
[Solo]

Remember when we were young
Times were hard and we played it tough
And we got caught between the fire and flame

It was so many years ago and nothin' lasts forever
Another lesson learned
On oh, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive

[Chorus]
