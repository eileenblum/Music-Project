[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

What the hell do you want from me
There ain't no way I'm gonna fall for all that bull no more
You're the hot shot spider with the mirror shades
I'm the fly who doubles for a sucker
Not this time, there's the door

Oh oh here comes the pain again
Oh oh trapped on my own again
Oh oh c'est la vie Mr. nice guy
Oh oh oh no

(A friend in need, a friend in need)
You'll be my friend, a friend indeed
A friend in need
Is a pain in the ass

Hey I think I've been down this way before
I can read you like an open book
In for a penny and a whole lot more
Everybody's got two faces
How can I be sure
Here I go again, another fuckin' hustle
Not here, not now, there's the door

Don't want you round here no more
No all for one, no one for all
Told you loud and clear, the exit is there
Don't come round here no more, no more
