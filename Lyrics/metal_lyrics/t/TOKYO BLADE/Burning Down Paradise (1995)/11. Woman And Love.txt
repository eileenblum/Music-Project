[Boulton/Marsh]

It's in the way they move, it's the skin tight dress
Nothin' I can say that ain't already been said
Turn out the lights, turn up the heat
It's monkey business

They put a smile on your face, we all slave to lust
Hits you like a hammer when you're already nailed
Slip off your shoes, pull down your hair
It's monkey business

[Bridge]
She's got the look (she's got the look)
Whoa, firing on all six
She's Miss Perfection (little Miss Perfection)
She'll tear your heart out

[Chorus]
Nothing as dangerous as women and love
No there's nothing as venomous as when love bites
Nothing on Earth can make you feel the way they do
No there's nothing as dangerous as women
Oh yeah
Women
Whoa, women and love

Throw down the rule books, love don't read or write
You don't stand a chance when her body talks
You've got the feeling, you've got to know
It's monkey business

'Cos the body is willing and the spirit is weak
You start to burn with the fires of sin
Down on your knees, crawling 'cross the floor
It's monkey business
