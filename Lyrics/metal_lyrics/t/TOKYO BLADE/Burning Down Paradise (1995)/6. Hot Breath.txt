[Boulton/Marsh]

There's a heat wave steaming, somebody's screaming
This ain't no place to walk alone at night
She looks every inch a lady, talk about gun crazy
Hey don't point that thing at me

[Bridge]
(Smile for the camera, do your striptease, the looks of an angel)
She ain't no dime a dozen (she is the look)
You never did a thing that your mamma said (no no)
Your teacher cried and your daddy wants to know where he went wrong
So wrong
Sweat it out

[Chorus]
Hot Breath, warm me from the storm outside
Hot Breath, like a switchblade cutting through the air (still night air)
Hot breath, turn my pain to pleasure when my body cries

City hot and sleazy, take it slow and easy
Squeeze the trigger, pump it right on time
Ease the gun down babe, you know my safety's off
Move your sweat drenched body close to mine

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Oh down there on the streets
I'm burning from the heat
Shooting hot lead, hear it call
Be there, catch me when I fall

[Solo]
