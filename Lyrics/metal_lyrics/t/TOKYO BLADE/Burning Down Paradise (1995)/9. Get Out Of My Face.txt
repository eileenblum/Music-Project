[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

Stop messing with my head, stop messing with me
Stop messing with all the things that I want to be
Run around your weekly routine that might suit you
But who the hell are you to question my attitude

Every day it is the same old story
Reach for the TV. and the radio
Oh here they go again, messin' with the air waves
I can't take anymore

It's always in your face, I'm tired of being told
What I can be, what I can't wear
I ain't happening oh no
What's wrong with everybody
Everybody wants to look like a dude from a glossy magazine
Oh no not me

Wow what was that? That was the latest trend
Hey which way did it go?
You've got to be quick, you've got to be smart
Don't wear no sensible clothes

[Chorus]
l don't like the way you look, l don't like anything about you
So If you stay, I'll go
l don't like anything you say, I don't like your point of view
So If you stay, I'll go
Get out of my face, get out of my face
Get out of my face, get out of my face

Just want to make it clear, I don't want to be rude
But I don't like you, you don't like me, so get out of my face
You ain't no Mr. Wonderful, you ain't no Mr. Cool
Who the hell do you think you are, you're Mr. Ego

Wow who was that? Somebody famous
Hey which way did he go?
 Here today, gone later today
That's just the way that it is

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]

I don't Like what l hear about you, oh you know what you can do
So if you stay, I'll go
I don't like the things you do, you can stick your point of view
So if you stay, I'll go
Get out of my face, get out of my face
Get out of my face, get out of my face
