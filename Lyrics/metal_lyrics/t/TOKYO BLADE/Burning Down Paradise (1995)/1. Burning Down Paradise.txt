[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

Do you believe in God in heaven
Do you believe or have you lost the faith
Did you ever try getting blood from a stone
No-one hears you screaming when you're standing alone

Nothin' else to give, we're killin' ourselves to live
It's a crime and we're wasting time
All the young dudes with serious attitudes
It's a crime and we're wasting time
I want what's yours and you want what's mine
It's a crime and we're wasting time
Little of what is said makes sense in my head
It's a crime and we're wasting time

Burning down paradise
Like taking matches and gasoline
And placing it in a child's hand
Burning down paradise
Is it too late (too late)
Burn...
We're burning paradise

Man with a gun talks about revolution
Do you really believe that it's a solution
Does it make you laugh when you hear them lying
Do you cry like a child 'cos you're scared of dying

He's the king of the alley, his queen's the gutter cat
It's a crime and we're wasting time
Man bleeding in the rain we ain't got time to feel his pain
It's a crime and we're wasting time
There's a man with a grin says he's free from sin
It's a crime and we're wasting time
We're sliding into mud...man I've had enough
And we're wasting time
