[Boulton/Marsh]

Another, another lonely night
I want to know who can be right
She's dressed to kill and I'm under her spell
I think I know her, but I never can tell

[Bridge]
You give to me that something I need
Without you near I just can't survive
I need your love, but that look in your eyes
Is so much colder than Ice

[Chorus]
Midnight rendezvous
I've got to get a message to you
Midnight rendezvous
What more can I do

You're tearing my heart out

I close my eyes but I still feel my pain
I'm pushed away while you play your game
You're not so shy, but you've got nothing to say
Just look at me and throw my heart away

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

You run, you run away

[Solo]
[Chorus]
