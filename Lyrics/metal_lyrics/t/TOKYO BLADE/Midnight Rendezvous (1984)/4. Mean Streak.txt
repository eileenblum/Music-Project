[Boulton/Marsh]

Standing in the shadows, evil smile upon his face
Today he's on top but tomorrow he'll be down
He strikes for vengeance then he's gone without a trace
Mark my words, he'll be back, no time to lose

[Bridge]
Play into his hands, it's no good turning back
One look into his eyes, a face that twists your mind

[Chorus]
Mean streak
He's got a mean streak
Oh mean streak
A mean streak

Acting like a child but he walks the road to ruin
Steal everything you've got, then throw your life away
When he gives a helping hand, do you know what he's doing
He's got the power to make things work, it's part of his plan

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
