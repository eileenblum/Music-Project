[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

Woke today, my heads a daze
I can't remember a thing about the night
Reflections of an empty face
There's something wrong and I'm lost without a trace

[Bridge]
Lady killer, a lost cause
Locked away, screaming in vain
Body wrapped in chains
Going insane, I can't stand the pain

[Chorus]
Break the chains, break the chains
Break the chains from me now
Whoa - oooo

Feeling cold, my fears returned
Close my eyes, but the nightmare still remains
I can't believe, my eyes reveal
I can't recall where I was the night before

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
