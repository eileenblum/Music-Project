[Boulton/Marsh]

Standing in the shadows, see a vision on your mind
You will see the sunrise, will you make it through the day?
Running down a side street, is somebody after you
Got to turn and face it, there's just no other way

[Chorus]
Down on your knees, praying for the day to break
No one to hear you cry, death rules the streets
Running wild, running wild

Night in the back streets, nobody dares to walk
A shadow by the streetlamp, a chill runs through your spine
Your head in your hands, your back against the wall
A tear from your eye, as you see the metal shine

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]

Killer City, how can we live when you destroy
Killer City, will stand and fight, we have to survive
