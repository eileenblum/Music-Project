[Boulton/Gwilym/Marsh]

Do you remember the nights, well things may come and go
But I never had a woman with skills like you possess
Its a lethal weapon that you sure know how to use
You handle it like dynamite, your kisses light the fuse
You're never alone to face the night

[Chorus]
One white lie (one white lie)
Danger calling (danger calling me)
Oh when we touch I feel the pain
One white lie (one white lie)
Danger calling (danger calling me)
When we make love I don't feel no shame

You rehearse it well but you make me feel so good
Around you I'm like an animal with its first taste of blood
Its jungle law, no regrets is what we had
But its gotta be said, to be that good you must be bad

[Chorus]
