[Boulton/Marsh/Gwilym]

Down on the streets again something is stirring
Something in the air tonight now the boys are back in town
You'd better run (you'd better run) when the sun goes down

[Bridge]
Now this boys addicted, needs a physical reaction (physical reaction)
Love and hate, such emotional reactions (emotional reactions)

[Chorus]
Higher, take me higher to the fever
Fever of the night
Oh oh, passion and emotion
Higher, take me higher, such mixed emotions
Mixed emotions
Oh oh, passion and emotion

Temperature starts rising as the lights go down
You an feel it all around, it cuts the air
When lightning strikes the heart, its time to be aware

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
