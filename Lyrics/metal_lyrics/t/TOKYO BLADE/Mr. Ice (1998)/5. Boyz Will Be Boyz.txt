[Boulton/Marsh]

Run your hands way down your body
Oh yeah you know you're feeling the thrill
Every night out on the town
You know that you're dressed to kill
Every move that you make
I think I'm falling in love

I don't need no medication, no designer drugs
'Cos when I look at you I feel your body talk

[Bridge]
Me and the boys going wild in the streets
Looking for some back street love
Watching high heeled girls wearing teasing smiles
We all play the fool in the name of love

[Chorus]
Don't need no doctor, no medicine man
Naughty naughty, boyz will be boyz
Slow and easy, fast and smooth
Naughty naughty, boyz will be boyz

Oh its a no win situation, we're all born with this addiction
Oh don't need no provocation
Just cant live without that body friction
You silhouette is kicking
You make me feel so proud
