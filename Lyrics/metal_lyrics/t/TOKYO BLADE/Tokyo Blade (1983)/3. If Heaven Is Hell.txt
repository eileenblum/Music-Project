[Boulton/Marsh]

Light, burning in your eyes, telling all your lies
leading me to hell, and I just hope and pray
That I'll be there some day, I'm going all the way

[Chorus]
If Heaven Is Hell
You'll never get me down
If Heaven Is Hell
You'll never get me down

Run, fighting to the end, just what will we learn?
Will we burn away?, is this what you want?
Its too late to change, stare it in the face

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
[Solo]

Don't, don't turn it away, we fought it so hard
Now we can't, turn it away

[Chorus]
