[Boulton/Marsh]

I don't stop for no one, no one pushes me
I'm just here for living, just running wild and free
I don't give a damn, no one is gonna stop me
In dark and empty streets, nobody sees

[Bridge]
I'm a killer, running free
I'm a killer, can't you see

[Chorus]
Liar, now you run for your life
Liar, Now you run for your life

In the dark of the night, in the light of the day
Take my hand and you'll see hell and the face of fear
It's no place to hide, there's no place to run
When your name's on that list

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
