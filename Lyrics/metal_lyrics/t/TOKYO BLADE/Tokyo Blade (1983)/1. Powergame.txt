[Boulton/Marsh]

You like to mess around with all the guys in town
And you don't give a damn what that means to me
And now there's no one left that you ain't cheated on
They've all got wise to you, just like me

[Bridge]
You're living, you're loving, you've got to beware
You're cheating, you're scheming more than you dare

[Chorus]
You love it, you need it, Powergame
You want it, you feed it, Powergame
More power, more fever, Powergame
It's hot, It's money, Powergame

Cold and hard inside, steel look in your eyes
The promises you make are only there to break
Looking for the action but you should know by know
Sleep on alone at night, for you own sake

[Bridge]
You're crying, You're bleeding, there's nowhere to run
You're lying, you're screaming, it's your turn to burn

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
