[Russ Ballard]

Stands at the bar, just a glance away
Could be she's just a dance away
Playing games with her eyes
What she does, she don't realize
Wants her so bad, she feels the same
They don't make a move, they play the same game

[Chorus]
Tonight, Tonight
She's just a glance away
Maybe just a dance away
Tonight, Tonight
There's no faking it
They're gonna make it
Tonight, Tonight
I bet before the night is gone
They're gonna get it on
Tonight, Tonight
There's no faking it
They're gonna make it
You're gonna make it tonight

Now he's thinking if only she would smile
I could move in, I'll give her a while
She says to herself what's he waiting for
Why don't he say what he's come here for

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
