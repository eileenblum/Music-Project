[Boulton/Marsh]

The time has come for you to go
Always knew that this day would come soon
Reality is knocking on your door
You hope to awaken to a dream

Scream like a child, lying still, it cannot be changed
Look in your eyes, cold as ice, a heart made of steel

[Chorus]
In the dark of the night
In the light of the day
Sadness in your lonely stare
Something chills you inside
On through the night into the twilight world
On through the night into the twilight world

Shadows close in, your time here is short
It's time to reflect on your life
Can't change your mind, there's only one way
Your spirit starts slipping away

A voice from inside screams out "Why, tell me why I must die"
The end, it is near, and a tear fills your eye

[Chorus]

It's over and over again

[Solo]
[Chorus]

It's over and over again
Over again, over again
