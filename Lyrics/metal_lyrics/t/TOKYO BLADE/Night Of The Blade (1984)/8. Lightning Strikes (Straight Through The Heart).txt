[Boulton / Marsh / Wright]

I want to know if there's a reason
We keep on searching, we don't find a clue
In the gutter, in the free zone
We're all monkeys in a human zoo

[Bridge #1:]
I won't take it any longer
Street lover, a love alone
The storm is raging, it's getting stronger
It's like a bomb, it's ready to blow

[Bridge #2:]
Thunder rolls, and I can't live forever
Thunder rolls, I just can't take it

[Chorus"]
Lightning strikes straight through the heart [x4]

Keep trying just a little harder
Give me an inch and I'll take the world
I'm hungry, think I'll raid the larder
I need attention like a little girl

[Bridge #1]
[Bridge #2]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge #2]
[Chorus]
