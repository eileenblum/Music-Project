[Boulton / Marsh]

That girl, she don't give a damn
I try to fight it but its driving me mad
Nothing stops her, nothing ever could
Like a flame burning inside
One look into her eyes, she'll burn you alive
I can't fight it, don't know if I should

I know you run around, I know the things you say
I feel the pain but I can't turn away
I know its wrong but I just can't break the spell
Cold as ice, always in control
But you're so distant, always far away
Can't believe it, thought I knew so well

[Chorus:]
Someone to love (someone to love)
Gonna make you feel alright
Someone to love (someone to love)
Gonna make you feel alright
Someone to love

Red hot, burning fire, gonna bring my love to you
I can feel your blood run hot
Gonna bring you, to your knees

[Solo]
[Chorus]
