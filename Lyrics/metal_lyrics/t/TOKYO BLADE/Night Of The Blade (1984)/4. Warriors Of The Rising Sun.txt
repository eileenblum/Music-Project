[Boulton / Marsh]

Samurai!

In a long time ago, when the sword was your soul
And the sun turned to gold, and the day turned to night
A man stands alone, knowing he has the right
And the power of life, over all he surveys
With his sword in his hand, he rules all the land
Even fools understand, he lives just to fight
A man rich in pride, no one dares to defy
Don't stare in his eyes, 'cos he's the samurai

He bows his head and cries
'By The Sword I Will Live To Die'
His eyes are ablaze when he screams out his name
He lifts his sword to the rising sun
The sun hits the steel as he's shielding his eyes
He rules with the blade, will it drive him insane?

Death in life is his only way
Blood stains the land as they heed his commands
He'll fight to the death, when he makes his last stand
The time will come when they claim his crown
He'll be cut down 'cos he's only a man
But until that day, he will rule all this land

Samurai!
Samurai!
Samurai!
Samurai!
By the sword, You live to die...

[Solo]

You first killed so long ago
The way the warrior learns to fight
Can you feel your life's blood draining away?
Has the power to foresee
Knows the future, what's been before
Can't you see he's getting stronger? Sa-mur-ai!

Samurai!
