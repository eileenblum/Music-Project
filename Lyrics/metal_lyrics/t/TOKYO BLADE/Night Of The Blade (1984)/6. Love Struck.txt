[Boulton / Marsh / Wiggins]

I can't stand it, feels like a heart attack
Don't know what's right or wrong
Just want the night with you
My head explodes, burning fireball
Caught in a one way street
I imagine the things we can do

[Chorus:]
Love struck, overload
I'm losing my head over you
Love struck, overload
I'm losing my head over you

Hungry and wild, losing all control
I'm being ripped apart
But I'm caught in the heat of the night
My body screams, I just can't get away
I've got the stage tonight, I know that the timing is right

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
