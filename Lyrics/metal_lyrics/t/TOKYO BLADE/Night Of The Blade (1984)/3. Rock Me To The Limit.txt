[Boulton / Marsh / Wiggins]

Put on your dancing shoes
Let me see those baby blues
I bet your mama never rocked like this
She still thinks its illegal to kiss

Rock city, it's not out of fashion
It's burning strong like a voodoo passion
You hear the music on the radio
Rock steady, ready to roll

[Bridge:]
Role reversal in a guitar dream
A Northern girl she's fine by me
A cigarette that never burns away
Rock &amp; roll is here to stay

[Chorus:]
Rock me
Rock me to the limit
Rock me
Rock me to the limit

Anyway, beg, steal or borrow
Keep on rocking like there's no tomorrow
The music's loud, sleeping dogs don't lie
The jukebox juice is running high

We're all living in a teenage dream
My baby's rocking like you've never seen
The sweet sensation of a midnight cruise
Like rock and roll you can never lose

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Put on your dancing shoes
Let me see those baby blues
I want to see you dance
Oh, rock me

[Solo]
[Chorus]
