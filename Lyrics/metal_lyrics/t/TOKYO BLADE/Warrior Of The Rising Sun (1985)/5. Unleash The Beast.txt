[Boulton/Marsh]

Step this way, don't be afraid
Ten minutes of your time, the show has begun
Don't wait too long, there's room for more
Straight through that door, no need to run

[Bridge]
Now you pay, too slow to see
How it's too be, oh the lies
Death on the run, take me now

[Chorus]
Running, running for cover
Running, unleash the beast
Running, running for cover
Running, unleash the beast

The time has come, don't run away
Just step a little closer and you will be mine
You've made the choice, you're free to go
The price you pay is anytime

[Bridge]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
