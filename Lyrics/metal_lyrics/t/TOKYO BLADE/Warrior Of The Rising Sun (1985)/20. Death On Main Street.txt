[Boulton/Marsh]

In the heat of the night, in the light of the morning
Take my hand, I'll lead you there, the streets of fear
In the shadow of the sun, dark and empty streets
No ones safe, no one laughs, the message is clear

[Bridge]
When you're walking alone
Better run for your life
Somebody's screaming
Running with a knife

[Chorus]
Death On Main Street, no good screaming
Death On Main Street

In the streets of the city, no one's free from attack
Lock yourself away, can't face another day
Death doesn't need appointments, never know when it strikes
News reports are frightening, got to get away

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
