[Boulton/Marsh/Wiggins]

In the dark of the night, you stand all alone
Once you were glad to be free of your dreams
Now you can't stop your screaming
Cos the words never come

[Chorus]
The dead of the night
The dead of the night

[Solo]

The time's ten to midnight
When the price will be paid
The night is black and there's nowhere to run
He believes what he's doing
Now vengeance is mine, hear him cry

[Chorus]
