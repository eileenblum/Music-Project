[Astor/Schwartz/Pozz]

Downtown every night
Sometimes way to high
Too many women in bed
Can't even remember the last

Oh ya know what it's like
Hidin' from the daylight
When morning comes around
You feel upside down

Can't stop it
But we're gonna try
We're lookin' for
A little alibi

Don't like mirrors no more
Bang my head against the door
Do not think it's too late
Keep on goin' hell can wait

Oh ya know...
