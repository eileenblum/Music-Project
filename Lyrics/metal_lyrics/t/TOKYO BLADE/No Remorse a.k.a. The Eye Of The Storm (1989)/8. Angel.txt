[Prestel]

I love you
If we could only forget

The hard games
And words we only regret

Do you remember
When the summer nights
Could not be long enough for us
Your eyes were like the sunny sky
So blue
And all the fights
We had to get through

Angel - how I wish you were here
Angel - if you were near

I know you
You'll never lose control of
Your heart games
Even if you play rough

Do you remember...
