[Boulton/Pozz]

Shadows of so many souls are Calling
Oh killed
Never saw the next day dawning
The tragedy of a thousand years
Can't be changed
For all of us to see
Shadows of insanity

Many mothers and children cried
Burned down houses
No food in sight
Napalm bombs to ease their pain
All you've left is poison rain
Oh you're insane

[Chorus]
Shadows of insanity
Had their time
All across the lands
Shadows of insanity
Don't let it happen again
You'll never win
No you'll never win
You'll never win
You'll never win, oh no

Tortured people with broken minds
Empty stares
Or blasted eyes
Death and war have ruled the lands
No sun in sight
There must be an end
