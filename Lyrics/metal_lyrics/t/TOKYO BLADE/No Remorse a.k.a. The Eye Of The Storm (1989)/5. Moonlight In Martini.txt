[Boulton/Pozz/Pozz]

Everybody's waiting for the weekend to come
Thinking 'bout the things you've left undone
Thinking 'bout another woman's man oh yeah
Well you don't mind about it but you'd better take care

[Bridge]
Always out for easy shows
For little boys who wanna know
About the rock and roll of lies
sweet little terror 
Oh you know what makes you go go

[Chorus]
Moonlight in Martini
That makes you go out of our mind
Moonlight in Martini
All right
It's the moonlight in Martini
That makes you almost blind
Moonlight in Martini all night

With your bad reputation and your black leather pants
Don't deny you're lookin' for a one night romance
Chalk coloured make up and those stockings oh yeah
Oh I want you so bad, but I'd better beware

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
