[Boulton/Pozz/Pozz]

Saturday night when I'm with the boys
See me movin' 'cross the stage
Don't lullaby ya
Wanna satisfy ya
Hope it's alright below the belt

We are here your silver screen dreamin'
Lights hit - the guitars gleamin'
We are your wildlife screamin'
We are the creatures from outer space

Woman see the steel in my hand
It looks alright
But every night when the curtain falls
It turns into a knife

Tears are not enough
I want your blood and your body
I want you blood and soul
To go - you know

In the rock nights when the arrows fly
Rock 'n' Roll is...screamin'
Your legs as long as a rainy day
At the midnight hour you come out to play

I have a walk down and down your nerves
Right into the centre of your brain
Some people never get crazy
What a shitty life they missed the train

Woman see the steel...
