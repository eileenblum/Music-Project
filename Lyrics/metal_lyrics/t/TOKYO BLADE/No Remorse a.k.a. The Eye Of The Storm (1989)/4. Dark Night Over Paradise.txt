[Pozz/Machwitz/Pozz]

Hear the sounds, fell the light
As you wanna go out tonight
Oh you're crying and were sighing
The love you gave has turned to grey
Let him go dance the night
Feels like dying and were sighing

We give you strength to carry on
Hear this tune you're in this song
Oh its good to you
But we love you

[Chorus]
Dark night over paradise
Don't worry its ok
Don't worry baby hold you tight
Dark night over paradise tonight
and you wonder why

so dry your tears 
you're not alone
go put the stamp in the danger zone
no more crying
no more sighing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We know its never easy
When your love lies in the shade
And maybe after the curtain falls 
and the glitter fades

[Solo]
[Chorus]
