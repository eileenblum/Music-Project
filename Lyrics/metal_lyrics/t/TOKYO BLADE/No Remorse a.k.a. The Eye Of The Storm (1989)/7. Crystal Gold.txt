[Prestal/Sale]

Children of the future
Rise and take the land
You must find the answers
For what we don't understand
With the rock of ages
You will then transform
We live with constant changes
As a new rock is born

Crystal gold
Now you're lookin' at the crystal gold
Crystal gold
It's a story that is yet untold
Crystal gold
We are giving you something new
Crystal gold

Children of the future
We give you all that's new
No more useless paper
Nothing that's untrue

For the children of the future
They need something real
A brand new power structure
A whole new way to feel

Crystal gold...
