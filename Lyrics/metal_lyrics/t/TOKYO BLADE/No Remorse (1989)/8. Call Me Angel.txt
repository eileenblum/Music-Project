[Pozz]

You call me rude in the mornin'
You call me reckless late at night
You say our love surrounds a warnin'
No place left to run and hide

I babe I need ya - do me good

Come be my queen of the darkness
You will be my only light
Midnight ladies, stud my heaven
But you my star nowhere in sight

You can call me angel
Angel of the night
Oh you can call me angel
Come and share my life

These miss you nights are the longest
Can't you hear my mystic call
You're such a good drug for tired eyes
Get ready for the midnight ball

You can call me angel...
