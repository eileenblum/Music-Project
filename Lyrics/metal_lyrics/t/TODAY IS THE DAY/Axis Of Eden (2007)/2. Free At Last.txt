you're my sunshine in the night time you're my daytime in the night time and I know what's right and I
know what's wrong it feels all so right then it all goes so wrong I know you'll say when you answer
you're my sunshine in the night time you're my daylight in the night time and I know what's wrong and
I know what's right it all feels so wrong it all goes so right somehow we have reached the end I can't
control when this will end you ran so fast so fast you could not hide you are my sunshine now the end
I'm free at last you can't control me you are the past now I'm at peace left all alone I feel at home
all alone you ran so fast you could not hide you are my sunshine
