you preach the end the end is near my friend we'll meet again don't be afraid you'll fly away fly
across the sky you'll fly so high into the sky god owns you controls you ignores you god hates you got
it god kills love hate love death shoot until your weapon is dry see at night you should be fine fire at will it should ignite wrapped in nails no one in sight rip that rib straight from the gut cuts that burn you should be dust dead can't tell make them all dead burned alive save his whole head I am the father designed to destroy exis of Eden take my hand safe travels
