when I get mad I get real mad god I been so mad midnight I can't go sleep daylight whisper songs of
peace cast spells out throne my love your the one I need true love in you till you bleed one heart one
mind wish dream fly high you saved me gave me life home love when I was near the end you gave new hope
and love

I am reborn
