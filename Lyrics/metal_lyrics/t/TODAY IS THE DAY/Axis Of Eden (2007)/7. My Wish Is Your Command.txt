I'm down again c'mon I worked real hard you know me I'm a living god Christ can't bleed poison tell me
sell me what you want fucker tell me sell me what you say lies

I know I have no right cause I have no pride it hurts so bad I wanna die try to be strong and don't
show it it ain't me it can't be I can't see I can't focus lonely lost in the hell c'mon you oughta
live that way
