cannon rips through watch them die last hope shelter make them cry give in give up watch you die my
war burns on dead inside I am god soldier's dying's mother's crying father's hiding Satan is smiling
Satan is winning cast spells that work that kill and bleed the flock of life of all hope on my way
there I will run see my dad he looks so sad miss my home I feel so bad now I have nowhere to run
nowhere to hide nowhere I can sleep nowhere tonight I can hear I can't hear you calling my name when
I see you smiling when I see you laughing then I feel I'm living then I know I'm giving take this
words I give you learn them like a bible oh my son look my way oh my son live my way now I have
someone to talk to someone I can hide someone I can talk to someone tonight I can hear you calling I
can hear you breathing I can hear you waiting I can hear you needing when I see you smiling when I see
you laughing then I feel I'm living then I know I'm giving I can hear you calling I can hear you
breathing I can hear you wanting you must run into the light
