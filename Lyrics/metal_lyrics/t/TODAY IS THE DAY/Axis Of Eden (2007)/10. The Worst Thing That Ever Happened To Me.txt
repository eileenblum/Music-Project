let's dance let's dance and sing songs all night long drink and drink until dawn you don't care
there's the door I don't care back for more it's late I need I need to fuck you know you need you need
to fuck load my gun and it goes off I can't control hopeless thoughts try to live in too deep come to
me fist for fist fight to live in too deep you can't see faster and faster stronger and stronger and
higher listen and lister this I desire one fist of death one fist of fire my blood your blood drink
from the fire blacken  and stain your life into nothing you can't complain you drink from the fire
blacken and stain your life ino nothing crying in shame you feel into the fire burn I'm burning
suicide homicide genocide pesticide do it
