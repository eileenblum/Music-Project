Its time I made myself a plan
with this fist stone heart in hand
my blade my eye die empty man
it's you it's you not me you see
black crow false bird die fly in shame
uphold the truth don't die in vain
my sword your lord I score your dead
bleed bleed bleed stop breathing
goodbye don't cry my hatred
inside it's time to fly nowhere
it's time to live the truth or die
outland
