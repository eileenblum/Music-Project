It can be done
You've just got to try
Let's not deny
Winter's the coldest time
Do not give in
You can overcome
I'm in to win
I've just gotta try

Woman
What are ya' doin'
Woman
What are ya' doin'

Lover
Like what you're doin'
Lover
Love what you're doin'

I hate myself and everybody
I hate to lose
Feel like I'm dying
Gotta get up
Givin' my best yeah
Sun hasn't set
This ain't the end yet
I hang my head
I don't wanna try
I live to sin
Big time overdrive
Gotta get out
Gotta live my life
Take on today
It won't go away
I can see it
I can feel it

Honey
Honey
Honey
Whoa
Money
Money
Money
Whoa
Honesty
Honesty
Honesty
Honesty

My time is here
My time is right now
Let's just be clear
Ready to fight now
I have no fear
Gotta do something
Let's burn tonight
Let go let it burn
Wheelin'
Wheelin' through the mud
Wheelin'
Wheelin' just for fun

Lover
Like what you're doin'
Lover
Love what you're doin'
