I can't see what you see in me
Hopelessly try to pay your bills
Try so hard
I commit myself
I can't give you back love
iPhone iPod iPad PS3

My life my heart bleeding endlessly
Say you won't quit
I am going down
My life one heart bleeding endlessly

Try to look back
You're so burned by time
No love no hate
I resent your kind
Master of pain I salute your pride

I can't give you back love
iPhone iPod iPad PS3
My life my heart bleeding endlessly
Say you won't quit
I am going down
My life one heart bleeding endlessly

My blood burns in you
A space that's free
Only me
Loves you
Cares for you
Treats you so good
Kneeling down
Loves you
Lack of funds
An endless drum
Beating on
Scares you

Hope and pray
I've lost my way
Here to stay
I am with you master
Bleeding for you faster
Hope for change
An endless daze
Things don't change
Liar
Say you're sane
A painless gaze
Kindless weighs
Thank you
All the same
An endless maze
Lost in space
Martyr

Sky that's blue
Don't look like you
Black and blue
I am with you master
Bleeding for you faster
Tear it down
Burn it down
Fight to win
You'll gain victory
Lie down give up loser

iPhone iPod iPad PS3
My life my heart bleeding endlessly
Say you won't quit
I am going down
My life one heart bleeding endlessly

Die and try
Die a lie
Live your life
Give your life away and no one cares

Stand and fight
Fire
True til death
I am with you master
Bleeding for you faster

Burns in you
A space that's free
Only me
Loves you
Cares for you
Treats you so good
Kneeling down
Loves you
Lack of funds
An endless drum
Beating on
Scares you
Hope and pray
I've lost my way
Here to slay
I am with you master
Bleeding for you faster
Rise up
Stand strong
Live long
You are the future of me
