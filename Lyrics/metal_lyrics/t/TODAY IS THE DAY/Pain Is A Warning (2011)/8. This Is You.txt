Up against wind
The fiery wind
I hold on to nothing
When I look
You turn away
All I am this is you
The more I try
That's when I fail
Hate to say this is you

Long time ago
Far away
Sang a song so happy
Wasn't sad
Full of life
It wasn't bad just happy

When I look
You turn away
All I am this is you
The more I try
That's when I fail
Hate to say this is you

Lookin' back
When I was standin' tall and strong
Hopes so high
A mile high
Felt so right and wrong
When I look
You turn away
All I am this is you
The more I try
That's when I fail
Hate to say this is you
