Heat and pain
Moves you
Twist and break
Fools you
Feel insane
Can't shake
All the same

Can't stop
Pushin' away
Lookin' away
Drivin'
Spyin' on you
Lookin' at you
Tryin'
Actin' the same
Lookin' away
Fearin'
Makin' you lose
Makin' you drown

I can't feel it
I can take it
You can't make me be what you want
I'm not afraid
I am the man
Do what I say
Do what I want

Prison losers denied freedom
You can't make me
I won't fake it
You are not real
I can't fake it
Honesty can't be bought
Not for sale
Not this time
Ridin' high
As high as high
Rockin' times
Live my life

Black birds callin'
Flys by fallin'
Eyes wide open
Sees me comin'

I'm not afraid
I am the man
Do what I say
Do what I want
I can't feel it
I can take it
You can't make me
Be what you want
I'm not afraid
I am the man
Do what I say
Do what I want

Reach out take it
You must make it
It's in your reach
All that you want
Gotta be strong
Gotta stay on
Gotta think fast
Gotta kick ass
Gotta throw down
Gotta think mass
Take this moment
Claim your fame
Break the chain
Beat the game

Gotta be strong
Gotta stay on
Gotta think fast
Gotta kick ass
Gotta throw down
Gotta think mass

Doin' what's right
Makin' it last
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Life's not a game
Claim your fame
Step right up
Time to shine
Let it roll
Let it ride
Time to rise
No time to hide
Victory smiles wide
Wild life
Heal to die
Cast out demons
All I'm feelin'
Make you screamin'
Black out
It's your life
