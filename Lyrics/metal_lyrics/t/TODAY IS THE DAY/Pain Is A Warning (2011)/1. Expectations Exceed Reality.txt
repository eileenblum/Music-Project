Want to be the best of me
Bless my soul
I am god
Strange new fate
No time to hate
Lookin' down
I AM GOD!!!

Hungry
Broken
Eyes sad
I'm broken
Honesty burns in me
Thankfully I'm broken

Reach inside
Downward slide
Past the burn
I AM GOD!!!
Take my hand
Hold on tight
Reaching down
I AM GOD!!!

Hungry
Broken
Eyes sad
I'm broken
Honesty burns in me
Thankfully I'm broken

Fear inside
Scarred so bad
Free myself and win
Hope and pray
It's the end
Be myself again...
