I'm so broke
I can't feed you
I can't heat you
Cold outside
We need some food
You're starved
Slowly dying

Work so hard
Try to give you my life
Love to cling to
Sun can't shine
Empty dreamer
You're so blind
Can't you see it?

It's a lie
It's a lie
Work until you die
It's my life
Liars!
Liars!
Work and then you die
Death curse!

Take your life back
Time to take control
It won't stop you
Keep trying
Try hard
Life is dying
Got no gas
Keep on running
Slow start
Hit it running
Praise your work
You're so special
No slack
On the level
Kids are sick
Can't keep moving
Stand here
Fight for freedom

It's a lie
It's a lie
Work until you die
It's my life
Liars!
Liars!
Work and then you die
Death curse!

Take your life back
Time to take control
It's not your choice
Time to take control
Work or die
