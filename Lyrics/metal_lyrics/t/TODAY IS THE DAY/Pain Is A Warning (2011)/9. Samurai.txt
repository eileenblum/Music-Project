Hard time
No cash
Bad times
Long last
Work hard
Back bone
Brick stone
Fight back
Sellin' bullshit
Won't quit bitchin'
Jail break
Heart ache
Cryin'
Dyin'
And all the world it shines so bright
Beneath the sun I sleep at night
The emptiness will rise again
And on and on and I am dead
Smokin'
Drinkin'
Laughin'
Poison
Hot bath
No sleep
Shuts down
Thinkin'
Mind blast
Good grass
Winds down
Hard ass
Burned out people
Rise up
Strike back
And all the world it shines so bright
Beneath the sun I sleep at night
The emptiness will rise again
An on and on and I am dead
No life
Dreamin'
Bad guys scammin' me
Pushed back
Held down
Sad life
Got no crown
Bad blood
Pours out
Weakness
I'm wiped out
Darlin'
Hold me
Bleedin'
Show me love
Don't say
Stealin'
Dealin'
Wrong way out
Woke up
Sleepin'
Eyes closed
My nightmare
Good faith
Half baked
Feeling
I'm so stoned
Secret saviour
Highway to the end
Hold on tightly
Flyin' on the edge
Darlin'
Hold me
Bleedin'
Show me love
