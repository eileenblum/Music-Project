Taken
Laughed and ignored
What I do
I do for free
Blessed
The blind man is scorned
Cast from light
In a frozen sea
Beaten
Down to the ground
Lust in head
Strung up from a tree
Burned out
Without a sound
Can't move on
He can't be free

God
Got no life trapped in a downward spiral
Pushing back
go no place to hide
Honest man
He's condemned to die
Lost all hope
Slave deep down inside

Alive
Bent back by the wind
Roots so strong
He cannot defend
Passion
His passion is killed
Broke his bones
Til they got their fill
Desire
To be the one
Who breaks out
Heads straight for the sun
Raptor
Flies high in the sky
Left for dead
It pulls out his eye

God
Got no life trapped in a downward spiral
Pushing back
go no place to hide
Honest man
He's condemned to die
Lost all hope
Slave deep down inside

Sister
Drains blood from his veins
White and pale
A man with no name
Actor
With lines that are read
Hides his face
He'd rather be dead
Answer
The answer to bliss
Breathe no more
Death wish with a kiss
Hostile
This pain from within
Chains hold down
This demon within
Splinter
Tapped into his mind
Painful song
A song of delight
Jester
The punch of a joke
Silent sorrow
Drifts into the smoke
Submission
An end to a means
My time calls
An end to a dream
Blackened
Right down to the soul
The pleasure
A lifetime of gold
