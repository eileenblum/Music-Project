Shoot every fuckin' pig  Aim right at its head  They out number you  But kill 
as many  Aay aay  Yes Sir  Try and stop me  Eye for an eye  You're just a 
fool  Fake me  fake me poor little fool  Gave you my love  Stared at the moon  No 
thank you Honesty has left me   Honestly  hasslin' me   You're to blame
