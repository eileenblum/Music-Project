I gotta leave this town before I die I wanna burn it down just for spite  
There's nothing here  But pain and my soul  Why hold back  Kill yourself  Take 
the blade  Do it clean  Do it fast  Let it bleed  Like Christ  I rise above  I'm 
pissin' down all my love  I wanna be the one  To end your life  A blind 
imbecile   The Angel of life  Mister
