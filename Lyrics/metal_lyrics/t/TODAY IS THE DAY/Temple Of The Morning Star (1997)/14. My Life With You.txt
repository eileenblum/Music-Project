It's over  Get the fuck out  I don't need this shit  I'm not the problem  
You're not my friend  I'm all out of money  All you could spend  My life with you 
  You're makin me sick  I can't hear that no more  No one to talk to   No one 
no more  I'm leavin' today  I won't be back  I take what I want  No slack  I 
can't count on you  Hopeless now  you're gone and I'm sad  and you're just a 
memory  One that went bad  I cannot hate you  For what you ahve done  I will 
just miss you  And all of the fun  Nothing is sacred
