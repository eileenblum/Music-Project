Don't lean on me  Leave me be  Stupid mother fucker  You'll never see  You 
get where you're goin' by payin' your dues  not playin' fools  Best get schooled 
 Ain't no sucker  Mother fucker  And you know that now I left you  I don't 
hate you you're wearin' a frown  Understand  You gotta adjust  I think you've 
learned by now I'm not your crutch
