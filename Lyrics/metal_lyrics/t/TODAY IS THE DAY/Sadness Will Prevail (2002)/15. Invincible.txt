Gotta skip this town get it on the Way never can look down gotta lead The way
I'm jokin' I'm chokin' lookin' Far beyond lookin' way up high paint The sky
So black I will never die rippin' It out of me it just be you just might Die
Live your life in agony what I say Is what I mean I might be tempted don't Treat
Me like a dog run fast so hard Now I cannot wait this is the test Of my
Endless fate pleased to meet Ya' treat to beat ya goddamn hippie All of your young
Will die you never Answer your makin' me insane ya Goddamn idiot I'm not sure
It's not Clear let me find an answer for you I will not say it can't be done
I've Missed it pissed it kissed it away Now there's silence only silence Lonely
Silence I don't hear anyone No turning back I've gone too far Cut thru my
Skin I can't be who you Are I guess I don't fit in goodbye
