Why am I pissing blood I can't live I can't eat Time has risen land of the
Free It is no gift honesty It is my life don't promise Me shit drunk sad fuck
Live your life don't live mine Leave me alone I don't wanna be sane I don't
Wanna be saved I don't wanna be safe leave me alone Wait and see what you'll get
The best is yet to come there Oughta be truth inside honestly I've nothing to
Hide you aren't The victim you are the plague I stand for freedom I'm not a
Slave Lost away locked inside here I stand the test of time time Has risen land
Of the fake it Is no gift honesty
