Disguise you're happy drive your will Down design your backseat take This
Pill now you're up in flames And it's your world now try to be strong Though I
Know you won't try at all It won't be easy you can take down anyone Love up in
Flames and it won't come down Stop crying those tears it won't help Anyway I'm
Buying your fears Your short on love it's no use to beg I can't hear you
Anyway stand up and Fall you've been set up there's no Easy way you're nothing at
All inside Of the truth you live no lives in Spite of the truth you spread more
Lies you're doubting the question You won't back off I get it no shit Don't
Do it dumb dog nail 'em not a Chance I lean forwards I fall backwards I lean
Forwards time crawls backwards Round and round and round it goes Where it stops
Nobody knows you probably Will stare though you say you can't see Impossible
Pair it's fate they can't See how I love you till the end my Love for you will
Never end
