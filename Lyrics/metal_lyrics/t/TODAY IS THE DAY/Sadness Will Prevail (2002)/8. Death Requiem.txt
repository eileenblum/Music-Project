The path I walked in my life A lonely road I fell under The spell a long time
Ago I searched I looked for hope No one is there in death So sweet this sleep
I try not to Care no heartbeat fake smiles Cold hands in dirt at least I
Lived As hard as I could you made my life Complete you gave me a home slit The
Throat drain your blood wash The hate from the dove do it for me I will wash it
All away you've been Beaten kill that stray stop that Crying don't cry out loud
You keepYour silence and wear it proud I can't Say what I see just because
You're Sellin' me you're not real your face Is fake the world revolves around
Your fate it's not fair the shit You do all the pain all that's due No bullshit
Hard times for everyone Everywhere I won't be your dumb machine No brain no
Sleep
