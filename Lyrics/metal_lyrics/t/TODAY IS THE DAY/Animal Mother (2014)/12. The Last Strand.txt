ONE LIE
ONE CELL
FIGHT TO BE POOR
LIVE MY OWN LIFE
WANT TO
SELL YOURSELF OUT
DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL
I CAN'T THINK
LIFE IS SO SURREAL
CHEMISTRY
DOG SHIT ORDEAL
EVERY DAY
THINK I'VE BLOWN MY SEAL
LET IT GO
MY LAST HOPE
RADIATION
MY LAST LIFE
ISOLATION
YOU LIVE ON
ISOLATION
YOU LIVE ON
ISOLATION
ONE LIVE CELL
THE CORD IS CUT
ISOLATION
