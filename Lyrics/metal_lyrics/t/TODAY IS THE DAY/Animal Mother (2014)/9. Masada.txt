DYING IN THE SUN
DON'T YOU LISTEN
PEEL SKIN BACK RIP IT MAKE IT HURT
SOLDIER
REAPER
VICTIM
HEATHEN
CRY A RIVER RUN IT DRY
BOLD LIKE A BROOM
A WORN OUT SHOE
NO AMNESTY NO PLACE TO BE RIGHT NOW MISSED OUT
NO SIGN OUTSIDE SAYS COME INSIDE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE FUCKING OUT
CUT THROUGH THE ASHES THE TRUTH IT SMASHES YOU RIGHT NOW

I READ YOUR MIND
I LOOK INSIDE
AND I READ YOUR MIND
YOU LOOK AT MINE
READ YOUR MIND
LOOK AND FIND
READ YOUR MIND
LOOK AT MINE
READ YOUR MIND
LET'S START LIVIN'
LET'S START GROWIN'
YOU'RE NO GOOD THAT'S RIGHT
YOU'RE NO GOOD
