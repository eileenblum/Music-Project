I'M A SLAVE
I WANT TO MEET MY MAKER
IN YOUR GRAVE
I HOPE THAT THINGS GET CLEARER
YOU HAD YOUR WAY
I WANT TO MEET MY MAKER
CAN'T BE SAVED
I WANT TO MEET MY MAKER
OUTSIDE IT'S COLD
FAR AWAY
INSIDE YOUR SOUL
YOU WILL PAY
I GOT SO EMPTY
I GUESS I LIED
I STAND FOR NOTHIN'
I DON'T NEED LIFE
THE DOGS ARE HOWLING
THE WINTER'S RIGHT
A SON OF SATAN CALLING
IN THE NIGHT
OUTSIDE IT'S COLD
FAR AWAY
INSIDE YOUR SOUL
YOU WILL PAY
