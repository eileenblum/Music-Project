UNDER THE OCEAN
UNDER THE SEA
YOU WON'T BE THE ONE THERE
BE ONE WITH ME
I'M TRYING MY MOUNTAIN
I'M GOING DOWN
CAN'T YOU SEE NOW BABY
I'M WEARIN' A FROWN

SACRIFICE SACRIFICE
NOTHING FOR ME
NOTHING FOR ME
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE

MY HAND IS OPEN
YOU TAKE THE BAIT
IT'S TOO LATE NOW MY DARLIN'
RUNNING LATE
OVER THE OCEAN
STAR IN THE SKY
YOU'RE IN THE MACHINE NOW BABY
IT'S TIME TO FLY

SACRIFICE SACRIFICE
NOTHING FOR ME
NOTHING FOR ME
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE

EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL
EVERYTHING WAS FINE
IT WAS THE PHONE CALL
THAT GODDAMN PHONE CALL
DO NOT TRY TO BRING HER BACK
HER BODY AND BRAIN
PAIN IS INCREASING AT A RAPID RATE

TIME STANDS STILL
MANILEKA WHEN I WILL
DON'T YOU OWE ME DON'T SHOW ME
I CAN'T HEAR YOU I CAN'T BE YOU
OLD AND LONELY COLD AND EMPTY
I CAN'T BE YOU I CAN'T BE YOU
FRIGHTENED A STAR IS BORN
LIGHTNING LET IT ROAR
