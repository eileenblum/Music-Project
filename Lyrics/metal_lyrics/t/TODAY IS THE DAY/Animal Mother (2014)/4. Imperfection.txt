THIS IS YOUR LAST TRY
BE YOURSELF DON'T LIE
IT'S THE FIX YOU'RE IN
WENT TOO FAR
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID
TRY TO NOT DENY THIS
SPIED A LOT OF DISHONEST
LIED A LOT OF DISHONEST
YOU SHOULD BE NOWHERE
LONE AND LEFT TO DIE THERE
YOU CAN'T FAKE JESUS
THERE'S NO LOVE BETWEEN US
WANT TO BE PERFECT
WANT TO BE
