Waiting for some day
Watching my life fade
Praying for nothing
Life is a toothache

Fly away into the sun, my grave
Ride, let it begin
Your wings, under the skin

I am a bad man
I've got bad plans
Burning fire
Can't stop the bleeding

Time stands still
Your beating heart has healed
Ride, let it begin
Your wings, under the skin

Hate
Hate fills the heart
Tears it all down
Destroy

Death, my endless dream.
