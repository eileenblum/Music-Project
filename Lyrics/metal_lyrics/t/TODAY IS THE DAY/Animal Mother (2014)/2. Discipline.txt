WISH OUT THE CANCER
SOMEONE HAS TO PAY
LIGHTS OUT
THE THUNDER
THERE'S NO TIME FOR ME

DEAD EYES STARE AT YOU
RUN AWAY FROM YOU
PROMISE A UNION
I'LL GET AWAY
AWAY FROM YOU
I BLEED YOUR BLOOD
LOST CUT YOUR TEETH OR DIE
ELECTRIC BLUE
HIGH THE ONLY WAY
TIME WILL LET YOUR DOWN
LOST CUT YOUR TEETH OR DIE
I SEED YOUR SOUL WITH A REASON
AND WHEN THE ENERGY RUNS OUT
AND WHEN THE ENERGY RUNS OUT
