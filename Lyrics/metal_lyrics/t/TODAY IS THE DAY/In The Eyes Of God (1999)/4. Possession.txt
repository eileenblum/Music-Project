I could take your life Full on genocide
Take me for a ride I'll pay you ride
It's all in my sight Want me fired
Smash my face on glass I can't resist
Tearing down and fucking you Time will
Show you who I am Here lies the guy
With the really big mouth
Too bad I had to shut it I hated
To have to stomp that motherfucker
But he had it comin' You got it comin'
That's right you heard what I said
Everybody gets theirs in the end
