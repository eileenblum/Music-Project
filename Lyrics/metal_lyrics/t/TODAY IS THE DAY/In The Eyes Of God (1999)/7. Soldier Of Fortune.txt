When I'm down I can't speak
I can't say what I think
I don't know how I feel
Don't you beat me I can't deal
Can you I don't know what I want
What I need what I bought
You can't say what you feel
I don't get you
Or what you think
Can you hear me crying?
I am dying
Can't you hear me crying?
I am fighting
Born to lose
