I cannot see the sign You will
Not punish me The sun will
Never shine God damn me
Sometimes I feel insane
I think I have no brain
My answer I answer will not
Be yours I cannot be this way
But still I feel afraid
I wanna kill
This pain She bled me But in another way
I wanna feel the same Can't spend
Another day She bled me She led me
She left me dry
