It's fake I'm sure Afterlife
Slowly sinking I reach for
You But you're not sure
The sky is blue
Your hand in mine
We'll walk the stars Unashamed of who
We are We'll rule this world
With my big cock
Oh God I love you
I live to rock
What are you made of
What are you afraid of Pussy Get on
This hot fire Let me hear you scream
My good friend
