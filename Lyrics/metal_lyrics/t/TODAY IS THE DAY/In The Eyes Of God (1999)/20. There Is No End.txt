There is no end As fas as I can see
Here is my heart
Love is impossible
I'll give my life to have you here with
Me I'm not your God He is an animal
What is your name Who do you wanna
Be Life is hard pain
This is reality
Niggers Jews Faggots Whores
FBI IRA SLA ATF
Murder Mama Hate

TODAY IS THE DAY:
Steve Austin: voices guitars and electronics
BrÃ¤nn Dailor: Drums
Bill Kelliher: bass
