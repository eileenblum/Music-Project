I see right through
You can't trick me No way Reach so high
But too low
To give Speak the truth
Without fear
This is the way of power This is my vow
To live forever
I cannot fail
Time is the devil
And only love can heal this pain
No God above Is this insane
Fuck the world Tear it down
With me I can't make you see what you
Need to see It's inside Listen to me I will
Not fail This is my color Pain rules this
World Unknown
