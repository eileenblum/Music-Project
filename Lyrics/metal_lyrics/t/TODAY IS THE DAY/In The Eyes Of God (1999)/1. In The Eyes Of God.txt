Told you why Told you not to try
Don't you lie I am the enemy
I gave you what you want You
Live to piss on me I'm not afraid of you
Show your face my friend
All of the people are dying
No one's getting better
Your life is a lie A messiah
Will come My life is a lie Eclipse of
The sun Are you standin' Live
Black magic
