Sorrow In my cage I lose sight
Can't tell what's real wrong or right
You must try to pretend
Just try to fit in
Raise your fist to the sky
Lies cause cancer
Don't deny You're the master
Of my hell
I am I was born to be dead
You try and stop me
I'm gonna crush your skull
I feel so empty You don't want to decide
If I live I'm afraid of this world I don't
Wanna live Mayari I don't owe you
Can't make me I'm not your whore
Please don't rape me
I live to hate I fuck to live
I am messed up
I can never give in
I don't even know why
