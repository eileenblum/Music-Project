Bugs,
You got them bugs,
On you,
I see them bugs,
Mike Stipe,
Now he has bugs,
Don't want,
No goddamn bugs,
Kill.

Death March. [x2]

Whore,
You painted whore,
No love,
Ain't got no more,
So sad to see you go,
You whore,
I loved you so,
I tried.

Mommy,
Daddy.

Woah!
Yeah!
Fire!
Fire!

Woah!
Yeah!
Fire!
HIGHER!!

I stand alone, I stand alone,
You don't know what I face. [x2]

NO LOVE, NO HOPE. [x2]

Inside you...
Inside me...[x2]

The sky is black,
The fire is coming down. [x2]

Inside you...
Inside me...[x2]

The sky is black,
The fire is coming down. [x2]

Someday you'll get it...
