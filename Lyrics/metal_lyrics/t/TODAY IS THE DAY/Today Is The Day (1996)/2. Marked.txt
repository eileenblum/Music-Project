You are a coward,
You have no smile,
A common thief, the kind of person,
I despise.

You are a coward,
You have no smile,
A common thief, the kind of person,
I despise.

I have no place in the outside world. [x4]

You stole my honor,
You trashed my name,
You punish me for being human
-my demise.

I have no place in the the outside world. [x4]

You are a coward,
You have no smile,
A common thief, the kind of person,
I despise.
