I want a taste naked fixation ooh I'm so hell bent I should
kill her I should wound her I'll wax the bitch who I'm talking to who I'm
sleeping with who I'm smoking with I was afraid to unlock the door like a velvet
tear like a moonlit sky I can't find it in my home I can't find it in my heart
ya told me don't worry don't worry love Black Dahlia
