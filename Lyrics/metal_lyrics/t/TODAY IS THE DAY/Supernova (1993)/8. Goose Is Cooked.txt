Just like yellow plaid goose is cooked where have I been
where have I gone gooses cooked all in spades what is it about me that makes
you so mad is it the way that I look or the way that I smile what is it about
you that makes me so mad is it the way that you look or the way that you smile
what is it about them that makes me so mad is it the way that they look or the
way that they smile I hit you you hit me back
