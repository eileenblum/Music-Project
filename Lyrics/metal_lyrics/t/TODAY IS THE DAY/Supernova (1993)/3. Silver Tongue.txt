A storm is rising can't you sense it what are you gonna do
what she would say when your house burns down on your judgement day after and
after after the laughter words won't mean shit I'll plead with you I'll beg for
you I'll steal for you I'll plead with you looking down on me locking down on me
licking down on me I'm alright I'm just drunk fuck it man tell lies anything
