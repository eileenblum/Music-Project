Don't say this don't say that if I'm not me I'm not free
born alone die alone live you must live pushing and shoving and fighting and
feeling like a big nothing holding my hands and praying and dying all for nothing
I'm wishing for the world trying to survive try to stay alive wishing for the
world you're killing me you're testing me and I don't know I don't know they
stepped on me when I was down I had to get up just to get down god fearing bitch
supernova school of life
