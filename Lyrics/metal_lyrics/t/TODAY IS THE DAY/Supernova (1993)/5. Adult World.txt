Case of control bought sold goodbye well now you're here what
will you wear a rope or a gown nothing to fear I am flying I am frying home look
to the sun fire the gun shoot bang shoot bang criss cross dove flight broke
mean and tired I'm ready I'm ready gently softly put down the gun voices lie
cry oh burn me I wanna see your eyes over yeah get down get out of place
