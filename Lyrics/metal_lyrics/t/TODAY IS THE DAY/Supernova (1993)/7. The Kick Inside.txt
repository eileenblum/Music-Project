I've got this desire I've got this plan I'm gonna end it
all a plan to end all plans riot try it power surges Medusa urges on I've got
this kick it powers me I'm gonna live I'm feeling like a snake all over I'm
seeing in 3-D I'm taking down a wall of power a digital regime all alone nossip
Adam and eve they had to pick the apple picked it from the tree Adam and Eve
and Mary
