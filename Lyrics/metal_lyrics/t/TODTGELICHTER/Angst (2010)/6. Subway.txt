Empty shell - Empty mindEmpty face - Empty hideEmpty is the cult of NowThe Enso of a modern timeEmpty call - Empty cryEmpty scream - Empty lifeHopeless goal to flee from vainA universe of desperate strife Flickering light - Razor nightFluorescent weight - Shining brightKiss my shredded lips goodbyeAs I ascend to bloodless heights Without might - Land of blightDenied right - Senseless fightIn these tunnels we are freeBut only with our souls destroyed Welcome to life after deathA tunnel with no start nor endBlack light will conceal my wrathA glimpse of hope I must defend Welcome to life after deathA tunnel with no start nor endThe rusty subway takes your breathAbduction into Neverland
