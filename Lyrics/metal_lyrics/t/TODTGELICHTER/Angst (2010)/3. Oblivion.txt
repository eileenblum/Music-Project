Dead night comes nearThis is the fear of being forgottenDead night can't hearSwallowing the stench of something rotten In a construct of emptinessIron skeletons of dead giantsAnd here comes the last living soulWhich will vanish without a trace Sentinel of the deadThe last thousand years will come to an endClose the gates, make it endCover me with rust and mute my lament For the loneliness tears my heartKills my anguish, murders my angstAnd a final storm of dustSweeps what has been usAnd a final storm of dust sweeps usInto the mouth of the dead city sleeper
