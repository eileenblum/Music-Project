Hello, are you like me?
Can you feel what I still fear?
I am breathing, yet inhaling, silent screams one cannot hear...
Don't look back, you won't see me.
I am here and still not there.
Look at me, I am fading.
Feels much better not to care.
Hello, you're not like me.
The more you try, the less you care...
Breathless in awe we try tonight the life passing by.
Heartbeat pulse of life.
Breathless full of pride.
Heartbeat won't you let me go now won't you let me show now lose control and lose your mind and soul still know you're still alive and grow your hate inside will flow now full of pride...
Will flow now full of pride...
You weep now loss of pride, you creep to the inner side to hide the scars behind the tears...
The scars behind the tears...
The scars of all your fears...
Grow now your hate will grow now your hate will flow now your hate will flow now...
Hello, are you like me?
Do fear what I can feel?
Hello...
