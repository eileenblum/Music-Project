It's just a moment in time passing by.
Not worth a notion.
Full of life you missed the chance once again.
Useless to pretend.
This is the end.
Your life on display, years pass in seconds.
Face it with dismay.
Everything is reckoned.
When you grow old weary you find the time to rest.
But doesn't i seem scary, you didn't pass the test.
So hold your breath from time to time and leave this world far behind, to know that life doesn't lack for sense...
Everything is measured.
Everything is rated.
Time the crucial treasure, underestimated.
Hold your breath from time to time and leave this world.
Hold your breath.
This time.
Leave this world.
