If I want the birds to drop dead from the sky, the heavens will be void of life.
If i want the vermin to rot in the earth, the maggots will be fed on blood.
Feed on blood.
I am the power of the soil.
In consume the heat of the sun and I'm the deep of the earth.
I provide the source of life.
If I want your buildings to collapse, the ground will tremble through my voice.
If I want your cars to stop, I will ignite your gasoline.
I can take your life.
I can take your energy.
I can take your soul.
I can take your breath.
I'm the root of all your trees, the very net below your feet.
And I'm the deep of the earth.
I provide the source of life.
