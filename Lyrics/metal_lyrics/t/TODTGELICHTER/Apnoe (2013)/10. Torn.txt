Will you still be there when I fade away?
Does it feel that strange when we die?
Would I give my last breathe for new life?
Is this how it's supposed to be?
Sometimes I feel it tearing me apart.
Bloodless claws ripping my chest.
Sometimes I miss the piano tunes in the dark, dark room.
A lifeless mind cannot comprehend, prison following wherever it goes.
But every now and then I stop, listening to you from far away.
The stars still turn.
The air still flows.
And I give in , give everything for a new beginning.
