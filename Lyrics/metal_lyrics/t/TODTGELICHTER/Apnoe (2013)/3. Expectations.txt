All you see is black and all you'll be is sick.
And choose to live and all we do is fear.
Never came to notice this is life.
Still we ever try to define the way and let the others strive for our first, not best solution.
Take this life, choose your first breathe wisely.
From time to time take a deep breath in...
and let your colors burst to life
Find another way to die.
Define the way of ventilation new.
In and out to start it all again.
In and out to let the reign begin
Out of ashes and to the storm, another human poenix born.
Out of ashes time takes a turn, first you rise but then you burn.
You burn.
You choose to live and all we do is fear.
