Come - Fire.
Burn my past away.
Come - Fire.
Burn their breath away.
I hide my scars and cigarette burns, the things they did to me.
The abuse felt, the ignorance shown, converted to inner strength.
Thus ethics fail, regret dies, fury grows inside.
From smoke arises the beast in me, shattering the last frontier.
Come - Fire.
Burn their breath away.
My soul is scorched.
The torment is done.
The flame still burns.
Nothing you do can break me anymore.
I conjure thee, hailstorm of embers, over charred bodies justice will be done.
