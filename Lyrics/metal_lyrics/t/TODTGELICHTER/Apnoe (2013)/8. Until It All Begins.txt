Hush, little one.
You have no voice.
We have to rest until it all begins.
You shall come and take over your empire of the damned.
Was it selfish of me to bring you here?
Hush, little one.
We have to rest.
Your name isn't written yet.
Still I have known you long.
You're the evidence of my existence.
You fulfil me since before the beginning and leave nothing, nothing but emptiness when you're gone.
Hush, little one.
We have to rest.
I close my eyes and dream.
Soon we'll meet on the other side.
On the other side I will take your hand.
I wish I was beyond death to stay a little bit longer.
What it is all about, is the essence of being, the essence of life.
