I drift in the lights of the highways.
My journey is speed, speed of light.
Red-eyed targets in front of me.
Neverending bloodstream of civilisations.
No time for memories, no regrets.
Blurred faces by the wayside.
Were they waving their hands?
In motion they disappear without recognition.
They mean nothing to me!
No recognition, no realization.
And you mean nothing to me.
No time for memories.
They mean nothing for me.
In motion they disappear.
They mean nothing for me.
I drift in the lights of the highways.
I won't look back, won't hesitate.
This is the rythm of survival, hertbeat of societies.
Adrenaline corroding my veins.
Nothing but the flow.
Boiling blood, finally alive, forever caught in the circuit.
No one can stop me now.
Until my lungs collapse, until the end of my days.
Out of my way!
Until the last alveolus, until my lungs collapse, until the end of my days, until my lungs collapse.
Don't call my name.
The noise of the engine aborbs your voice.
So save your breath.
I had to leave you behind.
I'm miles away.
I had to leave you behind.
I am miles away, miles away.
One small hit and I veer off course.
Fever convulsions, my body is shaking.
I'm stumbling and fainting, writhing and falling.
My eyes are searching again, again for the lights of the highways.
