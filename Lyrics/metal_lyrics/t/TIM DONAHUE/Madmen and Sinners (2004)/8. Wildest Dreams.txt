Agnus dei, agnus dei

It's getting late
I close my eyes
And think of you my friend
Again

The wind blows through an open door
Leads me down a hall that has no end
And then

On a luminated shore
Funny how it seems just like
I've been this way before

Silver lights the still of night
Leads me far beyond the waters edge
And then

There before my very eyes
Pictures seem to melt into the sky
And then

Though I've heard it said before
No one really knows for sure
What lies beyond the door

I'll take you there in my wildest dreams,
And then
I'll see you there in my wildest dreams
And no one can save us there

Tell me where my love has gone
A faded memory calls her once again
And then

Her fingers touch my very soul
Lead me to a well that has no end
And then

Thought I'd seen it all before
I close my eyes and dream about
What lies beyond the door

I'll take you there
In my wildest dreams
And then
To God I swear
In my wildest dreams
And no one can save us there

Where have all the people gone
Will we ever cross our paths again
But then

No one really knows for sure
If heaven waits
For those of us that sinned
But then

Well I'm not praying anymore
My destiny lies just beyond
That hidden stained glass door

Take me there
In your wildest dreams,
Again
See you there
In your wildest dreams,
Again
You can't compare
To your wildest dreams
No one can stop and stare
No one can save us there

Agnus dei, agnus dei

It's getting late
I close my eyes
And think of you my friend
Again
