Hang on slave far beyond the grave
Gods children say someday we'll meet him again
Faith, guilt, rage turn back the page
The blood of Judas runs all through your veins
Someday we'll meet him again

A million miles away
In a land where the wisemen prayed
For heavens sake oh, watch what you say
'Cause I believe anyway
The world is going insane for now and ever

Hang on slave burn down the gates of armageddon
How long must we wait until we meet him again

A million miles away
Take a vow to your master of fate
On judgement day oh, watch what you say
I don't believe anyway unlock your morals in chains
For now and ever it's for now and ever

He walked into the room
With a gleam in his eye
Fortelling what was to come
He slowly drank from a chalice
And broke the unleavened bread
The congregation stood in awe
As a light from above shone on this man
And as the heavens parted he looked up to say
Beam me up scotty

Hang on slave far beyond the grave
Pain and guilt and rage
Break down the gates

When the heavens start to wake
And the earth begins to shake
Better learn how to repent
It's your only hope my friend
Burning ashes start to rain
On the children of the flame
