It's been a thousand years
Shed a million tears
But one thing lasts forever
The scars of love will burn you deep inside
As you step across that flaming deep divide

Climbing up the walls
I've been through it all
And threw it all away yeah
The scars of love burning deep inside
As you step across that flaming deep divide

The man above is watching in the sky
Take a step across that flaming deep divide

A young man prays a friend betrays
It's all the same now its all the same to me
Lie awake lie in state its too late now
To change what's meant to be

Consecrate desecrate seal you fate now
Doesn't matter much to me
Can't you see can't you see
Don't, don't turn away feel my pain
Don't, don't go astray feel my pain

Feel my conscience slip away
As my body levitates
Better hold on tight
'Cause the earth tonight will shake
Burning at the stake

So don't, don't go away feel my pain
And don't, don't go astral feel my pain
And don't, don't walk away
Feel my
Feel my pain
