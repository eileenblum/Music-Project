This is the end now no need to pretend
No flowers to send now 'cause this is the end
This is the end now I've seen it all before
Like a prisoner of war who's come to the end

Why didn't you warn me confidence in your eyes
Hides a feeling locked up inside
Should have told me nothing was in your heart
Had a feeling right from the start

Do you remember that fatal mistake
Other people now blame you
For the love that you made

Madmen and sinners nightmares and shame
In a room of broken mirrors my body in chains

Why didn't you warn me confidence in your lies
Shot an eagle down from the skies
You should have told me I never meant to hide
All the feelings locked up inside

Thrusted upon me cast to the wind
All the pleasures that bind thee
Lord knows that I've sinned
Blessed are those who forgive and forget
And if seeing is believing then now I regret

Come to your senses time isn't on your side
When the heavems and earth collide
And faith won't save you
When nothing is in your heart
Had a feeling right from the start

Madmen and sinners
In a room of broken mirrors
This is the end
No need to pretend now
