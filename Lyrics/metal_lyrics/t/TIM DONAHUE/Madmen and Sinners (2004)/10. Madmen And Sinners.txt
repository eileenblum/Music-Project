I. Persistence Of A Memory

There's someone in the mirror
Someone in the flame calls out my name
A history of silence a legacy of pain
Calls out my name
But no mercy no mercy at all
What's there to gain
Come heal me come feel me
The stars will fall now in vain

Learn to live and learn to forget
That's what they say
Persistence of a memory
Salvador in chains, calls out my name
But no feelings, no feelings at all
Now who's there to blame

Come to me, right through me and crawl
Crawl from this place
Come heal me, come feel me
The stars will fall now in vain
They're so far away, so far away
They're so far away, so far away

II. Water On The Brain

Look into the mirror step into the flame
Got a mental block need electric shock
I got water on the brain

It's here to stay just imagine it all
And fly away to the sun
Hallucinate for it's not too late
So long there's so long to go

Dripping from my fingers
My conscience slips away
Spinning like a top when will it ever stop
I got water on the brain

It's here to stay just imagine it all
And fly away to the sun
Hallucinate for it's not too late
So long there's so long to go

Got a funny feeling I've slowly gone insane
Better start believing I got water on the brain
A voice inside is screaming my body starts to shake

Better start believing I got water on the brain
A voice inside is screaming my body starts to shake

Come to me, right through me and crawl
Crawl from this place
Come heal me, come feel me
The stars will fall now in vain

They're so far away, so far away
They're so far away, take this knife
Save my life

III. The Good Book

Salman Rushdie tell me where you've been
There's a killer out to getcha gonna do you in
Satanic verses, written on the wall
Spill the blood of millions
In the name of John St Paul

It goes on and on, on and on
Give us this day our daily bread
That's what the good book says

There's a big fat fatwa on your head
Unraveling the future the ayatollah said
Cast away the devil, wage a holy war
Country verse country
Gonna settle ancient scores

It goes on and on, on and on
Give us this day our daily bread
That's what the good book says
It goes on and on, on and on
Give us this day but don't forget
Just what the good book says

IV. In My Head

I heard you calling out my name
Visions dancing in the frame
And as you crawl across my bed
Voices echo in my head

Now we've gone too far come to wear the scars
Let the pain last forever on the edge of life
Consecrate this night let me be your last saviour

And as you dance across my bed
Voices echo in my head

So look into my eyes tell a thousand lies
Put me under your spell this might be the last
Throw away the past no more soul left to sell

Now you're gone without a trace
Voices echo in your place

Wel I've been here before lying on the floor
When the silence awakens
A bleeding heart can melt all I ever felt
I guess I'll see you in heaven
Once again, yeah
