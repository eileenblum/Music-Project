Crawling slow across the floor
Neurosurgeons wait outside
Screaming out for more

Stepping closer to the light
Hallucinations take control
And spiral out of sight

Dark and blackened clouds above
Heavens only snow white dove
Makes it's way across the earth tonight

Are we chained forever
To this misery
Imprisoned by our lost reality
In the hours left to find
The master of the key
To your mind

Slipping out of consciousness
Anesthesia pulls me down
Into the abyss
My blood and pressure start to rise
Neurosurgeons dance before my eyes

When the tears that blind us
Fill the open seas
We drift together for eternity
In the hours left to find
The master of the key
To your mind

Only hours left to find
The master of the key
To your mind
Your mind
