Never mind what the good books say
It don't matter anyway
The kingdom never comes to a madman on the run
Never mind what the good books say
Apostles all betrayed
Giving up their lives for a piece of holy sky
Bow down and pray let come what may
In a world without end remember my friend

There's a voice inside your head
The verses you've been fed
Communion of the mind
Is such a waste of precious time
Bow down and pray let come what may
In a world without end remember my friend

Heard a preacher say
Another world awaits
For those who kindly pay him
A poor man gave and gave
He threw his soul away
But nothing did ever change

My heart bleeds for the madness
My heart grieves for the pain
My heart bleeds for the masses
And congregations swayed
Never mind what the good books say
It don't matter anyway

A thousand years have passed
Since the mold was cast
I guess some things will never change

My heart bleeds for the madness
My heart grieves for the pain
My heart bleeds for the masses
And congregations swayed
Never mind what the good books say
It don't matter anyway
