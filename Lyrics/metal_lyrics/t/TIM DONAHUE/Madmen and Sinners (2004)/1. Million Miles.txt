For so long so long battle fires rage
But a monster lies in disguise in the Nevadas grave
History is plain to see but the future's not so clear
Only one mistake is all it takes
There'll be nothing left to fear

Let the fires burn forever now until the end
Mankid crawls upon his knees
For a million miles
Let your children play together
In a world without end
Am I dreaming of a place
A million miles away

The roar of sound in the ground
Holds the world at bay
The planet shakes from atomic weight
In time for judgement day
A flash of light in the night is all that I can see
The sun and earth collide Better run and hide
For all eternity

Let the fires burn forever now until the end
Mankid crawls upon his knees
For a million miles
Let your children play together
In a world without end
Am I dreaming of a place
A million miles away

Hear what I say it's not too late
To conquer a nuclear fate
'Cause at the end of the game
There'll be no one left to blame
There'll be no way out There'll be no way out
There'll be no way out no way to shout

Let the fires rage let your children play
Let the fires rage a million miles away
