Beckon the days
And the years
And faces I've known

Funny but now
It all seems so clear
Will I ever let go

Guilty
With nothing to fear
Men reap what they show

But if I could only
Turn back the years
Would I ever let go
And nobody cares at all
You know

Sometimes it's so hard
To hold back the years
Let my innocence go

When nobody listens
And nobody cares at all
You know
