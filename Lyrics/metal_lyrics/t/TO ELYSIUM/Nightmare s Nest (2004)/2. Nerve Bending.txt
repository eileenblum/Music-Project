["Hope in reality is the worst of all evils, because it prolongs the torments of man." - F. Nietzsche]

A slow aching, bled dry of pain. 
The pace of life sedates the sane. 

Lure me into the fury of absence, 
let my train of thoughts collide. 
In a trance of confidence, 
stirring up, I breathe cyanide. 

Drawn in my horns, a stabwound slow-dance. 
Holding on to a dog's fair chance. 
A slow aching, bled dry of pain. 
The pace of life sedates the sane. 

I myself, I am a cold element, 
but I contain a living flame. 

Fading in, fading out, 
last visit for a long time. 
While a legend lingers, 
we pine away, into clime. 

The wish is father to the thought, 
the thought is father to the truth. 
Ignite the imagination and take it far away. 

I grieve over things that end, 
nothing in line to succeed them. 
They become a part 
of the horrors I hold in my heart. 

Neatly pealed all layers off, 
searching a stain to expose, 
lay bare imperfection, 
grow aversion, then dispose. 

Now your self is bare, 
in an instant flare, 
if you have tears, 
cry elsewhere.
