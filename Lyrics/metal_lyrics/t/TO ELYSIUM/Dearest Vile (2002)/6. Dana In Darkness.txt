[This I wrote when I lost my grandfather and a friend shortly after each other. I imagined the whole world being mournful, and it was. Cycles, all these fucking cycles. Death depresses me, but I always come out stronger, it makes me aware of the beauty it holds.]

Dana lies in darkness
Embrace after embrace
Dana lies in darkness
Time and again

None the less and all the more
We're in need of an excuse
Like the need for harbour
After a breathtaking voyage

Someone save me
Someone save us all

And here we are equal
Naked and of no concern
Here we all are lovers
In the hands of ourselves
The spirits
The gods

Slowly we move
Slowly we proceed
Slowly we grow to understand

Nobody goes the distance
As the day starts without the sun
No one's alone but on his own
When freedom is a need of nothing

Where would the birds fly
To transcend the limits of the sky?
Where would you go
To transcend the place which holds you?
