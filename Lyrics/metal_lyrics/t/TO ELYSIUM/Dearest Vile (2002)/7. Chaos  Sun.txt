[dark love songs are my favourite, it feels so damn good to lose your selves in one another. It's rather pathetic when reasoning, but I love to wallow in feelings. Have you ever?]

You caused a cry
Somewhere between dream and wake
Will you ever hear my prayer
Ever shed a tear for me?

Everyone hides away
As the nights descend
Everyone hides away
Just see if I care

A thousand songs and memories
Rise to meet the midnight sky
Towards my sun of chaos
Untill we collide

But it is you and not the wind i hear
As the light of day is swept away

Electric twilight, chaos/sun?
If it only was the dark
The dark alone
