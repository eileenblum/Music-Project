What lies above nourishes the below. The waste, the excrement. Rots the soil. Flowing downward for eternity. At the end of descent. Hidden colonies poisoned at the moment of inception. Unknown existence. The remains of powerful ancients. Deformed evolution, a cross between human and insect. Remarkable intelligence. Yet destined for extinction. A constant pilgrimage. In search of livable land, among the underground civilization. There is a prophecy that tells of finding the surface, but the above must be eradicated. The tools to destruction can be found deeper into the earth. Archaic technology abandoned by the ancients. Designed to send a constant signal to all above. If you feed them hate, they will engage in worldwide extermination.
