Sickening lives. Throes of squalor. Hollowed layer. Abhorrent tier. Terror abounds. Suffer the filth. Please - the mortal voice. Claim - the breeding ground. Disobedience. Temptations. Empty shells. Savage clamour. Archaic shadow. Solemn purpose. No headstone. Unadorned. Reeking moisture seeps in. Hatefilled murmers gather. Stir you bottom-feeding appetite, gorge to your delight. Feeding presence, divine. Lustful degradation, disparity. Rejoice, delight. Revel in the remaining flesh. Consume to your own glory. Real dignity ignored. Adament self-hatred is deep-seeded. Legacy of all consuming gore.
