The flesh of the surface world is burning
Two worlds become one
Your vision offers a dissection
Of what was
And what is
From above you see the swarming black mass
By your hands
The forgotten and the unknowing are decimated
You are lifted
Your eyes now see time
It moves like infinite sand in an hourglass
See through the darkness
From one form to another
Tear through the endless
Cast away this horrendous form
Ascend
Claim your birthright
Assume the throne of preeminence
Spanning dimensions
True freedom is only known by those who let go
