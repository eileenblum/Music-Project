Horrors of our predicament
Effluent stench of cerebral decay
Muttering malignant rumors
Cast down
Inquisitive
Vengeful
Align your now withered limbs
Dissection immanent
Abominable lore now fulfilled
Begin final struggle of selves
Inner intruder encroaches
Insectoid timeline unearthed
A thousand stories circulate,
Partings now interwoven
Sacrifice your form
To follow the precarious path
Forego your inner guidance
Acknowledge the task at hand
Beneath your peculiar shell
Lies a form made strong through time
Grotesqueries
Globe of green fire
Unbeknownst slumbers disturbed
Tremendous pain now endured
