The mind and its dreams
Can be dissolved
Recreated
Can you feel it
The shifting
The swelling
Far beneath something is breathing
Approach the mist
Speak the words of power
Bare witness to the manor of infinite forms

[Solo: Power]

Timeless
Chaotic
Destructive
An existence spanning beyond time
Incomprehensible intersections
Claim your birthright
Navigate the labyrinth
Take part in forgotten forms of worship

[Solo: Vella]
