Protect that which all dying life springs from
Find the ancient essence
Bathe in it
Be reborn
Cryptic transmissions
Are coming into focus
Harness the cosmos from within
This hidden planet
Awaken
Reanimate the remaining petrified
Realign the signals
Usher in the age of universal torment
Hear the calls

[Solo: Power]

Crack the sky
Find the surface and devour

[Solo: Vella]
