The real horror is what's between living and dying
Open your eyes
The unlocked memories of past lives
Can now be seen
You flutter
Once outside
Now inside
Traversing the hidden planet
Traversing the abyss
Behold the shambling abominations
Broken
The plaintive wailings
The spread of corruption is endless
Look inside them
Observe and absorb their memories
The creation
And the poisoning that followed
Etched into your mind
A guide through the expanse
Devour their remains
Steal their remaining strength
And leave no trace
