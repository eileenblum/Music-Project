"Transcendence requires a sacrifice"
On your quest for deviant divination
You have found these underground ruins
There lies a series of machines
Connected to a mirror
Shattered and fractured
You gaze and your reflection shows
A distorted foretelling
Your surroundings hold the key
The mirror is a portal
The portal is formed from blood
The machines act as ministration
"Begin transfusion"
The mirror fills and shatters
Before you lies an endless tunnel
Swirling crimson and black
Swallowing
Enveloping

[Solo: Vella]

In your dying moments
You reach toward
The carnage
Your body is ravaged
Your skin is dissolved
Complete obliteration of the self
Your consciousness is implanted
What is this specimen that you inhabit?

[Solo: Power]
