Worn and frail appearance
Stimulates yet another convulsion
Ecstasy in exaltation
Light radiating outwards
Seething
Mysterious glimpse
Gored embrace
Pallid features
Bodies rendered as tactile landscape
Leave your frame gorged
By a hideous inner form
Die and embrace your utility
Dismantled are the remnants of your anatomy
Such weakness
In confronting bio-degradation
Mingling beings within the shell of a body
Serve faithfully
Collective biological decimation
Reconquer lucidity through disgust
Detached
Pallid faces enclose mine
Slender outline
Visceral elemental conquers
Once illusive, distant
Now uneasiness possesses me
Yield an inhuman beauty
Emblazoned by red
Experiences cathartic collective pain
A torso torn apart by autogenous birth
Now a bulging wound of blood and bone
