Satiated by red
Living in demise
Essence seeps
Judgement of the corporeal
Deceived by your final form
Sickeningly consumed

Bereavement of flesh
Comfort in the death ritual
Speak of ascension
Otherworldly demise
Deny the catacombs
Rotten transition
Forms left lifeless
Cast back into the tomb mold
Fulfillment in decay
Belief in condemnation
Vile intellect rewarded
Decomposing essence

Abomination lives on
Displayed to all
Gaze into nullity
Return
to the depths
