Rotten throne.
Corrupted master.
Sending their vacuous subjects.
To hunt.
The old blood seeks the young blood.
Made by - undone by.
Born with eyes on the inside.
These parasites require insight.
The pale and blooming.
The depraved and rotting.
Co-exist in this valley of defilement.
Up to the shins in blood and sewage.
Born under a curse.
The pale must turn their search.
To the corrupted and rotted.
Their punishment shall be swift and ruthless.
