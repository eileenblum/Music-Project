Womb of nature.
Spoil and ruin.
Death yawn seethes.
Fire burns with no light.
Hell through a locked gate.
Spiritual judgement.
Vast profundity obscured.
Blasphemous union.
Seized by the delight of horror.
Marvel at the depthless presence.
Incumbent weight of an apparition.
Innumerable voices ring clear.
