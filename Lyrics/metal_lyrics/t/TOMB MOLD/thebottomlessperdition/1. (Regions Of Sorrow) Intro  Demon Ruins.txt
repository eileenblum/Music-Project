Deep beneath the roots.
The lost one's domain.
An ancient city - corroding architecture.
Servants chained - reduced to slaves.
The sorcery you casted grants one way passage.
All of this.
You stand to inherit with a single strike.
Banish this insect humanoid.
You will be king.
Free the fading city.
You can't turn back.
You may be devoured by your own regret.
Or you can let the old spirits.
Transform your essence.
One killing blow grants godhood.
Gaze upon your thousand children.
Swarming tentacles amongst a sea of black sand.
With your new set of eyes, you see all.
