[Tim Owens]

I sit here and I think of the time oh time that I wasted
And I didn't know what tomorrow would bring
There wasn't a plan there wasn't anything
I will not look back the winds of change are here
I am finally free it's time to live again
I wonder if I'd done things a different way
I wonder if I'd listened to my peers
Just listened to what they had to say
They said this could be a mistake
I will not look back the winds of change are here
I am finally free it's time to live again ah
Ah I will not look back the winds of change are here
I am finally free it's time to live again
It's a new day and every day is a better day
If only I had listened to what the people said
Everything's not always what it seems
It's time to live again I will not look back
It's time to live again the winds of change are here
Oh I am finally free it's time to live again
I will not look back the winds of change are here
I am finally free I wonder it's time to live again
