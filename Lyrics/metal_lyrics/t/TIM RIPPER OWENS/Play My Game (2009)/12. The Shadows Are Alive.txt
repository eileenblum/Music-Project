[Tim Owens, Chris Caffery]

As the daylight fades you must go inside
'cause this is a story of a man in the night
The black sky is closing in on you
A child prays she is one of the lucky few
Eyes of fire spawned from hell
Evil's here the shadows are alive
In the darkness the victims he will find
With piercing eyes he leaves no one behind
Eyes of fire spawned from hell
Evil's here the shadows are alive
In the streets he lurks until the dawn
A lifeless body it lays on the ground aah aw
A chill is in the air the town it lives in fear
They must destroy the beast its maker it will meet
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Eyes of fire spawned from hell
Evil's here the shadows are alive
Eyes of fire spawned from hell
Evil's here the shadows are alive
