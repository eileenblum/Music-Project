[Tim Owens]

You can't feel me at all
I am hidding behind the wall

[Chorus:]
Look out behind you, what do you see
I'll bet you see nothing, because it is me

If you think that you're the one
And if you're next, don't try to run

[Chorus]

It Is Me

[Chorus]

You'll feel my rush when your time is near
For it is me that you shall fear

[Chorus 2x]

It Is Me [4x]
