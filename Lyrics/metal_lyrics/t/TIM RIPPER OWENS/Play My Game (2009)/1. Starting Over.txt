[Tim Owens / Bob Kulick]

Time standing still
In this place on a dark day
Your soul is gone
I can't live without you

[Chorus:]
My life won't be the same
I know it's gonna change
I lost a piece of my heart
I've got to start all over again

I close my eyes
I see your face and I feel your breath
I stare to the sky
I never did my goodbye

[Chorus 2x]

I wonder where you are
I wonder why I'm here
Please tell me Lord you know it
Oh, my God, why not take me instead
Starting over again, I'm so alone
Starting over again, oh
