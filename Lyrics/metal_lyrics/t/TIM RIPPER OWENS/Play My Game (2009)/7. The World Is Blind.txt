[Tim Owens]

You wait til someone comes and opens up your eyes
And shows you all the places you don't want to be
A frozen Russian city the tundra of Siberia
Pollution is so bad that when it snows the snow is black
Just take a look around you
The answers you will find to see the world is blind
Now you see this place you live it's not so bad
But still there are some people who could use your help
A place like Africa malaria is all around
Three thousand children's lives are taken every day
Just take a look around you
The answers you will find to see the world is blind yeah aah
Take a look around you is there something that you don't like now
Can you hear me can you hear me now
Children listen children listen to me we got everything you need
Hold your head up got to hold your head up high
You'll see I wonder why we complain
Everything that we have's just insane
When there's parts of the world that's in pain
So take a look around the answers there you'll find
You'll see that the world is blind
The world is blind the world is blind
The world the world is blind the world the world is blind
The world the world is blind the world the world is blind
The world the world is blind the world the world is blind
