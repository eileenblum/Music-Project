[Tim Owens, John Comprix]

Whoa you can't stop this don't you try
Nothing's better I'll show you why I'll show you why why
That's the way I live I'm just a little insane
If you think you can beat me you come play my game
I feel you staring can't see your face
It's hard to focus when at my pace when at my pace my pace
That's the way I live I'm just a little insane
If you think you can beat me you come play my game
That's the way I live I'm just a little insane
If you think you can beat me you come play my game
That's the way I live I'm just a little insane
If you think you can beat me oh oh
You come play my game yeah eah eah eah oh
Come play my game ah
