[Tim Owens]

I, I've been searching around all the time
I know that I'll find peace of mind
In a place that I will call my own
In a place that I will call my home, call my home

We, we live to know where we will go
When the end comes I'll find a new road
But this time I just hope I'm not wrong
In my mind I just hope I belong

[Chorus:]
I will fight forever
I will fight to be free
You just make me stronger
Because I do believe

Now it's time to go down the right path
Something that I know will last
To bring out the passion inside
To bring out what's deep in my mind

I will fight forever (I'll fight forever)
I will fight to be free (I will be free)
You just make me stronger (You make me stronger)
Because I do believe
Oh, ya got to believe yea
Gotta believe in me, believe in you
Ya gotta believe, gotta believe
In everything you do
