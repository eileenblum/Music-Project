[Tim Owens, Bob Kulick, Brett Chassen]

I see your fear you know it's clear
Your fear whoa it's clear
Say what you want to it comes out lies
Believe what you want to
No good goodbye no goodbyes
You take control without a soul
You control with no soul
Say what you want to it comes out lies
Believe what you want to
There's no good goodbyes
Your fear you should beware
Say what you want to it comes out lies
Believe what you want to
There's no good goodbyes
No goodbye no good goodbye
