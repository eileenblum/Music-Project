[Tim Owens, Mike Callahan]

I see you looking at me
I think you need my help
Why are you looking at me
I think I know

Your life is getting rougher
I see it every day
You know that life gets tough
It makes you harder

[Chorus:]
You got to go down
To believe in yourself, so I really can help you
You got to go down
Everything's gonna be OK
You got to go down
I believe in myself and I know you will help me
Now you know whats real and you're not blinded

I see you coming towards me
I will not turn my back
I know the pain you're feeling
Won't last long

You ask what's out there people
You won't believe your eyes
Why don't you look around you
We will help you

[Chorus]

You got to go down, yea
Ya got to go down, to pick yourself up
Ya gotta go down, believe in yourself, y gotta go down

[Chorus]
