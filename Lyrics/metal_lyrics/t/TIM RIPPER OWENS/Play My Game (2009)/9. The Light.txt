[Tim Owens, Bob Kulick]

Ya gotta see it I know it's out there
Ya gotta feel it it must be heaven
I see the light it's right there in front of me
They say everything will be OK
If you believe it then you will see it
No asking questions it is forever
It's gettin' so warm it's gettin' so bright
I'll leave this world I love to take my final flight
I see the light it's right there in front of me
They say there is no need to pray
It is time please don't be afraid
Don't be left behind you can't be saved
Just keep on walkin' just keep on walkin'
Just keep on walkin' just keep on walkin' into the after life
Just keep on walkin' just keep on walkin'
Just keep on walkin' just keep on walkin' into the after life
I see the light it's right there in front of me
They say don't walk away from the light  there is no need to fight
I see the light it's right there in front of me
They say don't be afraid of the light
Walk towards the light you got to walk towards the light hmm
Walk towards the light you got to walk towards the light
Yeah mm oh the light the light the light
