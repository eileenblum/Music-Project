To the girl with the blood in her tears
Cutting her arms,
with the pain of her years
She searches for release
Life is her disease

To the boy with the bullet and the gun
Donât pull the trigger my son
Your story has just begun

The blood has been shed
The blood has been shed

The blood has been shed
The pain youâve fed
The pain youâve...
the blood has been shed

The blood has been shed
He died for you
The blood has been shed
You are loved, itâs true

YOU ARE LOVED
ITâS TRUE

To the girl, to the boy
The blood has been shed
The pain you have fed
The blood has been...
Shed

The blood has been shed
This pain you have fed,
The blood has been...

The knife, the gun
Redeemed by the One

To the girl, to the boy
The blood has been shed
The blood has been shed
This pain you have fed,
the blood has been
Shed.
