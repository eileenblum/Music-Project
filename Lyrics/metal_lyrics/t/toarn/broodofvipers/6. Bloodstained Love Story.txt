Oh my God, it is impossible to walk this path on my own

Why do we put ourselves on your throne

You who raise the lifeless
And guide our choices

You took the scars for my sin, a bloodstained love story
You gave me life again
Now I breathe for your glory (your glory)

Life is not worth living if I forget who completes me.
Life is not worth living without the reason I'm existing (the reason I'm existing)
Life is not worth living

We have felt the sentence of death, but our God raises the dead
