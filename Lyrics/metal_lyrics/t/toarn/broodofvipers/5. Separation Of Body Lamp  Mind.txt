This is separation of the body and the mind
Coming all together just to be freed inside
This is your separation of your body and your mind
(your mind)

This is your separation
We will not be broken
We will break the chains
We will be free
Fly with me
Fly and maybe you'll see
We will be free
Break the chains of humanity

Ashes to ashes,
we will rise again
Up to the sky,
where all will be pretense
We will take to flight,
we will rise again
We will be free
(will be free)

This is separation of the body and the mind
Coming all together just to be freed inside
This is my declaration,
I wont be broken
Breaking the chains,
well be free.
