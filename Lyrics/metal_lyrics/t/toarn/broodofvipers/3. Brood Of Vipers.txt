We are the priesthood,
we are the holy
Conform to us,
do what we say you should
Your words,
they cut my heart causing it pain
Tearing souls apart,
you've earned my disdain

We are the cold,
we've turned our backs on conviction
Our name is convenience,
no room for conscience
Your words,
they cut my heart causing it pain
Tearing souls apart,
you've earned my disdain

Brood of vipers,
we've all been called by name
Brood of vipers,
cant we all live by the gift of love bought by his tree
(bought by his tree)

We've been called to love
We've been called to spread life
We've been called to live
Not to hide in the night

We've been called to spread life,
not to antagonize
