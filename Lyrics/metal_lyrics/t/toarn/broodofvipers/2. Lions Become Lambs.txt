Is this all we are
Trying to find a sense of satisfaction
Is this all we are
Trying to find peace of mind

Is this all something we try to find
A little peace of mind
(peace of mind)

Can I be a man of measure
Help me father
Come and make me whole again
When Lions become Lambs
I find just who I am

When Lions become Lambs,
I find just who I am

Is this all we are
Trying to find,
a sense of satisfaction
Is this all we are
Trying to find peace of mind

Is this something we try to find
A little peace of mind
(of mind)

Can I be a man of measure
Help me father
Come and make me who again
When Lions become Lambs
Make me whole,
make me whole again
Make me new within,
make me whole again
Make me new within

Make me whole again
There are times in life where a person chooses to stand for what they believe in.
And when Lions become Lambs,
I find who I am.
I find just who I am

When Lions become lambs,
I find who I am
