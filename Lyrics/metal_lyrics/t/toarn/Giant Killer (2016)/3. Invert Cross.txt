I am a martyr
I am a martyr in my mind
Killing myself it seems is so much harder inside
You told me cast on the other side

I am a sinful man, but I run the race and lose the legs to stand at your feet
You told me you're the rock
I will never, never leave your side
But at the table, you told me
You'll deny me at the rooster's crow
The rooster crows
I deny your face
You ask me, "Will I watch your sheep?"
You know I will, invert this cross I bear
I am unworthy to die like Christ
Invert cross
Invert cross
I am unworthy to die like Christ
