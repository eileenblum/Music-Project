A flame burns within this chest
Burning brighter than hell's best
As your words drip with poison
I see your decay, oh, dearly fallen

This is my war
I fight it every day
Inside an out, this i declare war

This is my war
I fight it every day
I will charge you 'til you've been freed
You say that I'm broken
You say that I'm false
But i am the chose
And i will break your walls
We are war
We near our scars
This is our intention
We declare war
We tear down the gates to populate heaven
We tear down the gates to pillage hell
