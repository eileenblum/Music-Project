Why do we think we are, just because we create?
We're at the center of our whole broken world,
Is it shocking we're so broke
I am bot god
I am bot god, nor will I be god
I am not your rising son
I am not

If this whole world is based on me is it so shocking it's broken?
If this whole world is based on greed, is it so shocking we're consumed?

I am not your rising son
I am not your chosen one
I am not

If this whole world is based on me it's all over but the crying
If this whole world is based on me is it so shocking we're dying?

I am not
I am defined by the back of your cross
I am, I am not
