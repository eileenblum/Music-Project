In Flander's fields the poppies blow between the crosses row on row
And in the sky the birds stills bravely singing fly
Scarce heard amid, the guns below
We are the dead, short days ago
We lived, felt down, saw sunset glow
Loved and were loved, but now we lie in Flander's fields

Take up your quarrel with the for
To you from failing hands we throw the torch;
Be yours to hold high
We will never sleep, though we lie in Flander's

Now we lie, never to sleep
Though we lie in Flander's Fields
We will not sleep in Flander's Fields
We will not sleep though
We lie in Flander's Fields
