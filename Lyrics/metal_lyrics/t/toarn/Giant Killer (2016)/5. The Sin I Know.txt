This heart is rising in my chest
Has it gone cold like the rest
It's going astray

Father, forgive me for I know what I do
All of these pathways lead me to you

Every single day the same mistakes
But nothing ever changes, re-arranges
Don't tell me I'm fine
The sin I know

Father, forgive me for I know what I do
All of these pathways lead me to you

Amputate my heart, tear me open, tear me apart

Every single day the same mistakes
But nothing ever changes, re-arranges
Don't tell me I'm fine
The sin I know
All of these pathways lead me to you
