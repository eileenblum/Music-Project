Rise from your slumber
You are the kings of tomorrow
You stand and fight when they all step aside
You stand your ground, when they turn to run
Giant killer rise,
Giant killer, this is your time

Take your stones, take their heads
You suffered blasphemy
You've suffered their indignity
But listen up, you're worth more than this
Giant killer, you're worth more than this

You are tomorrow's kings and queens
You were made for this

Take your stones, take their heads
Rise, rise from your slumber
You were made for time as this
Take back the time,
Take back your life
Giant killer, rise
Giant killer, this is your time
Take your stones, take their heads
