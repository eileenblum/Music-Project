Mistakes, repeated, oh God not again,
How do I avoid this all, this can't be happening?
The tensions building up, my world starts to crumble down,
Do you know what it takes to confess?
Something you've been keeping inside for the longest time,
Something you've been keeping inside,

It's not that easy,
It's not as simple as you think,
It's not that easy to put the past behind us

I can't, I can't confess, these feelings in my chest,
What am I supposed to do? When I'm dying inside,
If I could I would,
If I could I would express at the top of my lungs

I've got a confession to make but you'll never care,
That's why I'm leaving it all behind,
You'll never know how it feels, I've got to let it go,
To save myself from all these nightmares

I think the best thing to do now,
Is to lock myself and throw away the key,
I'm better off dead,
But I believe, I'm stronger now,
To survive all this mess by myself

This is not my time to lose,
I will not give this up,
This is not my time to lose,
I will not give this up

Mistakes, repeated, over and over again,
The consequence,
The after-feeling, they've all got to go now,
The tensions,
The building up,
My world starts to crumble down, do you know what it takes to confess?
I will confess, I'm just waiting for the right time, truth be told, I wont let you down

This is my confession
