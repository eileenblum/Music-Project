[Verse]
What's happening to me?
Could someone please let me know?
Am I the only one (The only one)

[Pre Chorus]
This can't be real,
It takes two to feel this,
This can't be real,
It takes two to feel this
WAY

[Chorus]
Why can't I feel a thing?
How did I lose everything?
Why should I be the same?
Let me know what's happening

Oh, I'm so numb, I'm so numb,
You're killing me, my bloodshot eyes

[Verse]
I hate the person that you have become,
You're like a thorn in my side,
I've never felt this way before,
You've caused the waves to become a tide,

[Chorus]
Why can't I feel a thing?
How did I lose everything?
Why should I be the same?
Let me know what's happening

[BREAKDOWN]

I'M SO NUMB

Why can't I feel a thing?
Why can't I touch a thing?

[Chorus]
Why can't I feel a thing?
How can I lose everything?
Why should I be the same?
Let me know what's happening

Why can't I feel a thing?
(Oh, I'm so numb, I'm so numb)
How did I lose everything?
(I'm so numb, I'm so numb)
Why should I be the same?
(I'm so numb, I'm so numb)
Let me know what's happening
(I'm so numb)

What's happening to me?
(What's happening to me)
Could someone please let me know?
Am I the only one, the only one?
(Am I the only one?)

[Outro]
You will not run away from this,
Lights will guide you home
You will not run away from this,
Lights will guide you HOME.
