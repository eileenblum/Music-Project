The first time I realized
what it's all about
Anxiety inside their eyes
was everywhere around

I can see the tables're turning
I can feel the fire burning

(Where lies are real)
It's out of my without control
(When truth reveals)
I am the Last To Know

The first time I heard the voice
talk about clues
Suddenly I had no choice
than to be yesterdays news

I can see the tables're turning
I can feel the fire burning

(Where lies are real)
It's out of my without control
(When truth reveals)
I am the Last To Know

Everyone talks about, the word is out
and no one's blame will show
My story tells a lie, I don't know why
I'm always the Last To Know

The first time I realized
what it's all about
Anxiety inside their eyes
was everywhere around

I can see the tables're turning
I can feel the fire burning

(Where lies are real)
It's out of my without control
(When truth reveals)
I am the Last To Know
