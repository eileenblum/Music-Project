You don't know how the story ends
when your trust has turned to hate
You wanna know how it all depends
on the other side of fate...

A sudden loss of reality
the morning bliss is gone
Dark black clouds building up the heavens
the sun won't shine for long

You hear the thunder roar
and nothing will be the same

Shine On (we're shining on) shine on like the stars in the sky
Shine On (we're shining on) a hero will never die

A silent prayer for the chosen ones
who stood on holy ground
We find our way through borrowed hours
as the flame is fading out

You see the lightning strikes
and nothing remains he same

Shine On (we're shining on) shine on like the stars in the sky
Shine On (we're shining on) a hero will never die

You hear the thunder roar...

Shine On we're shining on like the stars in the sky
Remember Shine On (we're shining on) a hero will never die

You don't know how the story ends
your trust has turned to hate
You wanna know how it all depends
on the Dark Side Of Fate...
