I try not to live my life in sin
My time is my castle, I'm the king

But, still I believe in freedom
'cause there's a rhyme to every reason

I'm only Human
I'm just a man
(I'm just a man)
I'm only Human
I do the best I can

I've got a restless heart &amp; soul
My mind is too curious too hold

But, I need the space around me
thou' I need the love to surround me

I'm only Human
I'm just a man
(I'm just a man)
I'm only Human
I do the best I can

I do need the space around me
thou' I need the love to surround me

I'm only Human
I'm just a man
(I'm just a man)
I'm only Human
try to understand
try to understand
try to understand
I'm only....
I do the best I can
(I'm just a man)
