I woke up in the dead of the night
I'm cold and alone in my bed
I need love to set me free
from the worries I have in my head

In my dreams, she's right here with me
helping me through the night

I want her to take me away
and surround me with her tender wings
I am ready to surrender my heart
enraptured by the love that she brings

I am lost, don't know where to go
without her in my dream
This is forever and meant to be

Fly me away
on your Wings Of Desire tonight
Fly me away
and show what love's about

She is true, she is real,
she is all that I need
An angel of love, sent down from above
I wish I could make her believe

I am lost don't know where to go
without her here with me
This is forever and meant to be

Fly me away
On your Wings Of Desire tonight
Fly me away
and show what love's about
This is forever and meant to be

(Fly me away)
on your Wings Of Desire tonight

Fly me away
On your Wings Of Desire tonight
Fly me away
and show what love's about
Fly me away, Fly me away,
and show what love's about
On your Wings Of Desire
Take me away...
