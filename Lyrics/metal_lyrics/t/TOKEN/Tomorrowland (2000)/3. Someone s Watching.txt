One look over the shoulder
it feels like something's around
Nothing but the chills running colder
no vision and no revealing sound

A red-light over the doorway
casting shadows into the room
Nearby a presence in the darkness
throughout space and the way around the moon

Someone's Watching me from a distance
Someone's Watching you from afar

No sign of anyone stranger
but somehow the freedom is gone
A small eye a warning of danger
control of life and everything that belongs

Someone's Watching me from the distance
Someone's Watching you from afar, yeah

Someone's Watching...over us...

Someone's Watching me from the distance
Someone's Watching you from afar

Someone's Watching me
Someone's Watching you
Someone's Watching us
Someone's Watching me
Someone's Watching you
Someone's Watching us
