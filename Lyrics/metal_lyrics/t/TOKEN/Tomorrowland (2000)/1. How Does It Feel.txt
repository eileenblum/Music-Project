Somehow it's plain to see that you care for me
but there's no one there to set you free

You know it's different now
When we've changed our sides

How Does It Feel?
when love is gone?
(Now tell me how you feel)
to be all alone?
How Does It Feel?
without love and no one to lean on?

Now tell me How Does It Feel?

It's hard to loose the pride, I know it's tough to hide
and let your honesty share your lies

You know it's different now
When we've changed our sides

How Does It Feel?
when love is gone?
(Now tell me how you feel)
to be all alone?
How Does It Feel?
without love and no one to lean on.

Everything is different now.
When we've changed our sides.
How Does It Feel?

How Does It Feel?
when love is gone?
(Now tell me how you feel)
to be all alone?
How Does It Feel?
without love and no one to lean on
