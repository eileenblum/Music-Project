There's a girl I know
she seeks flowers under purple skies
And when the cold wind blows
she lights up a candle for all her lonely times

When nature calls
she's waiting for her man
When darkness falls
to protect and understand
Among the flowers in the world
he's not one of those
he's an Undiscovered Rose

There's a man I know
he walks the rainbow to believe in love
All the colors that glow
he can hear the angels sing from above

When heaven calls
he's waiting for his girl
When faith is lost
he needs to hear her words
Among the colors in the world
she's not one of those
she's an Undiscovered Rose

Her tears have all run dry
He lies restless in the night
But there's always in their minds
that the one who seeks will find

When nature calls
she's waiting for her man
When darkness falls
to protect and understand
Among the flowers in the world
he's not one of those
he's an Undiscovered Rose
An Undiscovered Rose
He's not, she's not one of those...
...Undiscovered Rose

Two of a kind...
Not one of those flowers...
Two of those...roses...
