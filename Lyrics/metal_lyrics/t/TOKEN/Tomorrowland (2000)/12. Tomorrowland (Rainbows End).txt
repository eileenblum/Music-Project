There's a bridge over the waters
that we built with hopes and dreams
A legacy for sons and daughters
but nothing ain't what it seems

I am, you are, we are a rising star
in a wishful thinking world

Broken promises and laughters

We live, we die, and never wonder why
we are heading for diseaster

(You're welcome to...)
Welcome to the Rainbows End
(A future game...)
where all the gold turns into sand
(We are alive...)
We are alive in Tomorrowland
Pay the price and roll the dice again...
...in Tomorrowland

Our lifes is just a fantasy
we are puppets on a string
Masters command our destiny
and leads on the road to ruin

We live, we die, and never wonder why
we are heading for diseaster

(You're welcome to...)
Welcome to the Rainbows End
(A future game...)
where all the gold turns into sand
(We are alive...)
We are alive in Tomorrowland
Raise your voices and try to make a stand...

In a timeless time
On a placeless place
W are out of our minds
We are out of space
I am, you are, we are a rising star
in a wishful thinking world

(You're welcome to...)
Welcome to the Rainbows End
(A future game...)
where all the gold turns into sand
(We are alive...)
We are alive in Tomorrowland
Pay the price and roll the dice again...
...in Tomorrow...land
