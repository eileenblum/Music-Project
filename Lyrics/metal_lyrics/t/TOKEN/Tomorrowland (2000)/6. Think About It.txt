Hey girl, don't you think it's time to say goodbye
One word without a single lie
Hey listen, can't you feel it in your heart?
that everything we say and do will tear us apart.

There's no passion between us anymore
We've learned our lesson that this love ain't worth fighting for

(Goodbye...)
Why don't you Think About It?
(And try...)
and get on with your life
(So why...)
Why don't you Think About It?
This will be our last goodbye

So long, I know it can't be any other way
Let's be strong and make this a shorter pain

Down we're falling to the point of no return
I can feel it calling we're getting close to crash and burn

(Goodbye...)
Why don't you Think About It?
(And try...)
and get on with your life
(So why...)
Why don't you Think About It?
This will be our last goodbye
our last goodbye
why don't you Think About It?

Think...Think...Think...
Goodbye...and try...so why...
you know this will be our last goodbye

(Goodbye...)
Why don't you Think About It?
(And try...)
and get on with your life
(So why...)
Think About It?
This will be our last goodbye
Goodbye...
Why don't you, why don't you,
Why don't you Think About It?
