Far away but so close in my mind
and some other day we get together in time
I believe in our kingdom come
Feel our love burning brighter than the sun

Forever you're inside my heart
where no one has been before
Together and never apart
you're my angel and I will be here
Eternally Yours

Silently you whisper sweet in my ear
And suddenly the loneliness disappears
I believe we are one
I know we'll be together till the end of time

Forever you're inside my heart
where no one has been before
Together and never apart
you're my angel and I will be here
Eternally Yours

I believe we are one
Feel our love burning brighter than the sun

Forever you're inside my heart
where no one has been before
Together and never apart
you're my angel and I will be...
...here you're here in my heart
Oh - Together
Eternally Yours
