Dark streets, the shadows are haunting you down (down to the ground)
Lights out, there's nothing else there to be found (inside your mind)

Your memory has faded, you don't how
(No!) you're here alone...

Reach out in the night
this is Destination Nightmare
You try to stop and turn around
but your mind is getting nowhere

One touch, invisible and far away (all is grey)
Black eyes are telling you not to stay (listen what they say)

Your memory has faded, you don't why
(No!) it's getting close...

Reach out in the night
this is Destination Nightmare
You try to stop and turn around
but your mind is getting nowhere...getting nowhere

Too late, there's no excuse, no salvation (inside this dream)
Don't wait, you've reached the final station (is this reality?)

Your memory has faded away, you don't how
(No!) you're here alone...

Reach out in the night
this is Destination Nightmare
You try to stop and turn around
but your mind is getting nowhere
No, no, no reach out in the night
this is Destination Nightmare
You try to stop and turn around
No!
