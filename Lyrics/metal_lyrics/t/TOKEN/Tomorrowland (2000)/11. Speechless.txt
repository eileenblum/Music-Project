An early morning in December
a light broke through the winters cold
It's a day I will remember
when I was reborn

I'm Speechless, I'm breathless,
I'm out of words to express myself
the feeling is hard to describe
I'm Speechless and restless
I'm full of love and tenderness
I've found the meaning of my life
I'm totally Speechless

A new beginning of my lifeline
It's a sign of eternity
When I look into those blue eyes
I see me

I'm Speechless, I'm breathless,
I'm out of words to express myself
the feeling is hard to describe
I'm Speechless and restless
I'm full of love and tenderness
I've found the meaning of my life
I'm totally Speechless
out of words
I'm totally Speechless
out of words

I Love You...
