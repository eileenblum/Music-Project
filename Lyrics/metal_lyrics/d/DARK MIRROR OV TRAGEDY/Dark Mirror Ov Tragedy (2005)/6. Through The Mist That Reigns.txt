Through the mist that reigns,
I see you weeping and reflected.

Even my mortal scream for redemption
Could not unleas myself
And this suffocating yoke of painful memories
Has yet to be cast off, but so powerless am I.

I see you and you see me,
Embraced by grief and anguish,
And I still feel your heart beating,
Perhaps bleeding.

Let all my tears stream down so when they have dried out
I shall not suffer this penitence any longer.

Stream and shatter.
