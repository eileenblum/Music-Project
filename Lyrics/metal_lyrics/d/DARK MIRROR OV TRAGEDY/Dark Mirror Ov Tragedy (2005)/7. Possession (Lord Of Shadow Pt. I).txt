Your eyes what flame cold
Closer and closer to me
All over my worthless being

Ever imagined what I would look like to you,
Am I smiling, am I smiling a cruel smile?

Come not nearer!
May peace be with us for good
And you shall praise me for my beauty
Again as ever and forever.

Irrevocable
As my shadow already cloacks
Your body fallen at my feet.
Now give me another look of scorn,
But if you dare, and I guess
You do not need to do.

No more worries, no more pathos,
My fair lady.
No more worries, no more pathos,
Close your eyes.
No more worries, no more pathos.

All your pain in my eyes,
All your grief in my eyes,
All your mirth in my eyes,
My eyes of the serpent that
Lusts for your soul.

Like a furious surge breaks itself,
Contempt and sneer that I see in your eyes
Swallow me deep into the underworld.

Splendour in the Grass
[Quotation from "ODE ON INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY"]
[William Wordsworth (1770-1850)]

What through the radiance which was once so bright
Be now forever taken from my sight,
Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower
We will grieve not, rather find
Strength in what remains behind:

In the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be;
In the soothing thoughts that spring
Out of human suffering;
In the faith that looks through death,
In years that bring the philosophic mind.
