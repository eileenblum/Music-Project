Your song wiped the trace of tears but it made a river of agony
Your song washed the scar of madness but it made a pond of solitude

In the fog my face was wet
Flood ran through my feet
This song that you sang
It burned into my skin all along
The chant that you tuned
It fixed on dark and deep inside
Sometimes constant rain that you sang had looked like your fading breath
It seemed to be a sob from birds of a distant mountain
So i was agonizing but i was not broken
Grotesque from yearning it made me a bloody one

The rain made heat haze on your shoulder
The rain made something shimmers beside you
Grabbing your hands froze hard at last
They reminded me that you were a phantom
Now i can't feel your rain
Although my eyes my ears open

And my body doesn't harden
I can't feel your rain
It just rains on memories
As if it only snows on the reminiscence in desert
It just rains on memories

Before left
Please let me forget you
I restrained you with faded remembrance decayed chain of yearnings
And i broke myself
With my sorrow my pain my solitude

Your traces made the pool of rain
And raindrops confused surface of the pool recalled pieces of echoes
I just followed raindrops on the surface of your traces
To escaping you
My body melted down by scars of rain's touch
Also as the rain that you sang
It sang a low song with shedding blood
As the rain that you sang

In solitude my afflicting monologue went on
Let me have eyes only for you again
To be swayed by my sorrow on the road to ruin
To be afraid by my anguish on the road to ruin
If i forget you
If i erase the memory
If i tear my passion into shreds
I will dance with bloody scream
