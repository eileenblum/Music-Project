Burned itâs blackish red my insteps were already torn theyâre holding on
Scorching enough enough Iâm not chilly thing any longer donât appear in me
All the capillary winds around me feel like heated all the things are inflated

Itâll rupture of the blood vessels donât put down me
My own eyes cannot closed he became to returned for the second for the third
I cannot myself to sleep donât look on me
Something is not in sight someone comes in chase of me in lightless light
In the end i feed the fire in a dead end

Open your eyes dear someone who was confined oneself voluntary
Some heart not glows any more you stand still in the icy moonlight try as you may run
Someone who is not a possibility you rise up there is no other way
Someone who is not a possibility you breathe easily the soul in fear constantly

I wants a wholly spatial just a mine free of impurities
Relieve me i was locked in a blind alley
I needs some body heat itâs all right yours
Relieve me i was locked in a blind alley
Give me my own name it had become deprived of great renown who else?
Relieve me i was locked in a blind alley
I have sunk in deep mire rise me up in your sublime arms
In a dead end i was locked in a blind alley
Here the moonlight so chilly soul unloose me
My breath paralyzed with cold-hearted atmosphere i cried

Thereâs no way that my own eyes cannot close frequently he is here is
Atmospheric pressure is massive it press on itâs ready to burst against the heart immediately
Sorrow resented again
They are returned worms all around every side wriggles in my capillary deep inside
All around
Wandered besides rapid roam the room Iâd returned under the babeâs mobile
Remembrance was replayed once again
Feels like inflated the middle feels so chilly it filled with the cold-hearted atmosphere
I donât struggle against fate itâs the inevitable through and through the reeking of the cold blood
They came down farther back
Iâm chained cannot rise elementary particles break up constantly theyâre destroyed constantly
Drawing aside provoke destroy because of against fate the reeking of the blackish blood is mine
They groan in grief
Sorrow resented again

Feed the fire in a blind alley
This world is not yours feed the fire in a blind alley
Remembrance was replayed once again
Feed the fire in a blind alley
That womb is not yours feed the fire in a blind alley
They came down farther back
Feed the fire in a blind alley
This epoch is not yours feed the fire in a blind alley
They groan in grief
Feed the fire in a dead end
The veto is not yours feed the fire in a dead end
Open your eyes dear someone who was confined oneself voluntary
Some heart not glows any more you stand still in the icy moonlight try as you may
Someone who is not a possibility you rise up there is no other way
Someone who is not a possibility you breathe easily the soul in fear constantly
I wants a wholly spatial just a mine free of impurities
I needs some body heat itâs all right yours

Iâm locked in the hollow water world
People came in flocks because they observe the movements of me
Give me my own name it had become deprived of great renown who else?
Everywhere only the reeking of the cold soul icy hearted
Iâm in panic stricken fear of the cold heart Iâm in dread of bare eyes
I have sunk in deep mire rise me up in your sublime arms
Iâm in panic stricken again
Dear my heartless lord take me the rather
Right now feed the fire in a dead end

In a blind alley
In a dead end
Thereâs no way that my own eyes cannot close frequently he is here is
Atmospheric pressure is massive it press on itâs ready to burst against the heart immediately
Sorrow resented again
They are returned worms all around every side wriggles in my capillary deep inside
All around wandered besides rapid roam the room I'd returned under the babeâs mobile
Remembrance was replayed once again
Feels like inflated the middle feels so chilly it filled with the cold-hearted atmosphere
I donât struggle against fate itâs the inevitable through and through the reeking of the cold blood
They came down farther back

Something is not in sight someone comes in chase of me in lightless light
In the end i feed the fire in a dead end
In a dead end
Feed the fire in a blind alley
In the end
I feed the fire in a dead end
In a dead end
