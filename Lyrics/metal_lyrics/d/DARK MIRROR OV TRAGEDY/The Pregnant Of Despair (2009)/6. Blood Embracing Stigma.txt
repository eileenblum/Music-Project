Walking through the endless dark tunnel
Vengeance gathering in me piece by piece
To become one in whole
Is this the dead end to where my soul has been dragged by a mystic light
Living memories being torn away raped away
This bloody stigma cursing me curses my existence
If this endless curse could be replaced by my wretched memories
This strengthless filthy corpse of mine
A struggling will from within
My body and stolen memories filled with pain and hate
Might burn into ashes might be lost in oblivion
Still raging i will be until the time comes
For it is my will
Never felt the warmth nor truth in this world
I who refused all those hypocrite smiles and promises full of lies
I who lived in darkness you dare to give me the light
Are you an enemy or fellow nevermind for it's too late now
Bless is to be found in the place i was born in hell
