I was returned to consciousness in an antique bookshelf
Where is there now it is i am still in existence who i am
Everything is tangled in my side with a certain thing
And i find out any terrible traces
The moment they are returned again started rush my memory again
Time elapsed when how it is the deuce is the matter where it is the matter
It wasn't the dream how was it that i came back here in spite of i died

I step carefully out of the bookshelf room
Why they are enliven and moving but they become different so suspicious so terrible
Their bodies torn as if anything eats into their heart
Who is not different much that reflected in the mirror is me
Suddenly pouring down from all quarters such as who burst into tears
There are too much noises here
They screamed pound the wall begging for escape
Deprived of the way
It is the same thing that i look around in this lightless light in atmosphere
No more worries no more pathos
I am fascinated by a touch have no bottom
No more worries no more pathos
I wandered from place to place
Then i see the shadows that was following me
I find out on the opposite side of certain eyes gaze intently
The seductive smile
As it danced or it become entangled
All was sticky and entangled
It led me into temptation who is not different much
When is not different much the past someone comes in chase of me
Then i look off the broken dark mirror
Someone led me into temptation he shed a sweet pheromone
I know you the existence of you intuitively
I was in the broken dark mirror
Hence you roust me i have sex it up
Still they are chased died conceived and cherished
I was sticky and get entangled
A pointed ray impaled to heart with a rapid
It pricked to backend to eyes and to pelvis
I wandered from place to place in the past
Then i see the lord ov shadows that was following me
I find out on the opposite side of certain eyes gaze intently
It pricked to my pelvis
No more worries no more pathos
My fair lady
No more worries no more pathos
Close your eyes
Iâm surrounded by rubbernecks with a naked i was seeing too
Split i opened the doors the room has an antique bookshelf
A little young girl was hanging on the hook she pricked cruelty
Her bodies torn as if anything eats into their heart
Who is not different much that reflected in the mirror is me
I know you the existence of you intuitively
Someone who was confined oneself voluntary
No more worries no more pathos
My fair lady
No more worries no more pathos
Close your eyes
By the stealth stolen a glance in covert still a marionette a doll like a cling on the babeâs mobile
Still shaken haven no resistance effort for the atmospheric pressure real dwindle thing to elementary substances
In the face of you i was still trifle have nothing volition
All your pain in my eyes all your grief in my eyes all your mirth in my eyes
Lusts for your soul
Shadows ov the lord the power of desperate the force of the frustration
It is namely the fates
Lord ov shadows the heart of yours that my source the origin
I named the shadowâs fate
The empty soul grown in the lightless light in an evil hour
The pathetic soul grown in the lightless gala in an evil hour
By the stealth stolen a glance in covert still a marionette a doll like a cling on the babeâs mobile
Still shaken haven no resistance effort for the atmospheric pressure real dwindle thing to elementary substances
In the face of you i was still trifle have nothing volition
The humble hovel i have been see the first light of day
But i was in a gorgeous palace now i was confined
They crying and wailing pair of lovers died with elopement
Then i see the shadows that was following me
I find out on the opposite side of certain eyes gaze intently
I also have i was pregnant a certain soul of despair
They came down farther back
I was rocking here is in a gorgeous palace
I was shaking for the lord ov shadows
They came down farther back
By the stealth stolen a glance in covert still a marionette a doll like a cling on the babeâs mobile
Still shaken haven no resistance effort for the atmospheric pressure real dwindle thing to elementary substances
In the face of you i was still trifle have nothing volition
I wandered from place to place
Then i see the shadows that was following me
I find out on the opposite side of certain eyes gaze intently
The seductive smile
By the stealth stolen a glance in covert still a marionette a doll like a cling on the babeâs mobile
Still shaken haven no resistance effort for the atmospheric pressure real dwindle thing to elementary substances
In the face of you i was still trifle have nothing volition
I was rocking here is in a gorgeous palace
I was shaking for the lord ov shadows
