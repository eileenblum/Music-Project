The tears which sheds at that day
Was flowing river that brim over with my sadness
The breath which spits out at that day
Was blown wind that get wrapped up despair
Time of a forgetfulness where the only vanity fills full
Roaming inside an exile about from place to place
Confined what why thus me
Already i fill a glass of my self
Drink in celebration of my shadows alone
My eyes have lost the focus
Cursed my own glory inside itself

It losing itÂ´s sight as a fantasy of future in the dark mirror
The sad soul in crying deeply inside
Lost of my hearing as a whisper of desire
I was not audible even if the voice of the angel
You said that is the true life

A get injured shape reflected in the broken dark mirror
Does it actually prove my existence
We large catch live in what
Iâm continuously the same place whirling
A gaze amidst the dark mirror breaks scans being cut
A heavenâs soul my angel
Iâm waiting on promised hill thus
In this place but will collapse at once in my exclamation

A heavenâs soul my angel
I throw away our promises finally
I throw away myself into this left place
A heavenâs soul my angel
That place does not exist in me anymore
Where youâll come to see
His hill disappears like that
With the exclamation of despair
Only one soul flew
Thus his heaven shut like that
With like gray light fantasy of bygone day
Only one stem light ascended
