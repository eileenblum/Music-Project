As the rain begins to fall and my shadow seems to fade
Still my pride is walking tall, but the hope has turned to hate
C'mon please, come walk with me through this endless, hopeless maze
I've been the one to lift you up,
but now it's up to you

I need your guiding hand
Your power and your strength
I need you, baby, heaven sent

Come on be my shining light
Fill the darkness, cut the night
I need you, baby, to lead the blind!

Walk with me, Run with me,
Lead me through the rain
Won't you help me through the storm
Come guide me, Come Lead me
(till) the sun will rise again
Won't You help me through the storm

And the wind it cuts so deep, divides the tears from the rain
Still I know, which way to go, hope this struggle is not in vain!
So, c'mon please, come take my hand, I got nothing left to blame
Ive been the one to lift you up,
Baby, its up to you!

I need your guiding hand
Your power and your strength
I need you, baby, heaven sent

Come on be my shining light
Fill the darkness, cut the night
I need you, baby, to lead the blind!

Walk with me, Run with me,
Lead me through the rain
Won't you help me through the storm
Come guide me, Come Lead me
(till) the sun will rise again
Won't You help me through the storm

Cant see no hope out there
Forgive me father, for I have sinned!
The Storm is drawing near
Is it the devil or the howling wind?
