The time is now, to sing the lovesongs for the planet
Gather round and try to find a way to save it

I still believe in our future
There's beauty to keep for our future

The hearts of the world, together as one
We're sons of the earth, where we all come from
Lets pray to the spirit, to the mother of all:
A-haaaallll!

Lets build the Temple Of The Earth

It's up to you, so c'mon fight this stream of sadness
One nature's dream, where we can live peaceful and fearless

For all of us to see, this creation
One unity to be our destination

The hearts of the world, together as one
We're sons of the earth, where we all come from
The hearts of the world, together as one
We're sons of the earth, where we all come from
The hearts of the world, together as one
We're sons of the earth, where we all come from

Lets build the Temple Of The Earth

Temple Of The Earth
Temple Of The Earth
Temple Of The Earth
