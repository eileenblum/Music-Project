Led by cold machines, chained to their existence
The future once bright, sacrificed by
Mankind

A lonely seed of green, behind this concrete life
Drowned by clay and steel. Progress be thy
Master

All, All In The Name Of Fire
Run by fool's desires
We're all determined to die
Ruled by machines

All, All In The Name Of Fire
All this foolish desires
Is leading us to die
Our own doomsday machine

It's the ghost in the machine, the creation of a beast
No longer can we hide from what we've once
created

All, All In The Name Of Fire
Run by fool's desires
We're all determined to die
Ruled by machines

All, All In The Name Of Fire
All this foolish desires
We can't stop our breed
A technological Frankenstein

[Solo]

All, All In The Name Of Fire
Run by fool's desires
We're all determined to die
Ruled by machines

All, All In The Name Of Fire
All this foolish desires
Like a vampire out for blood
Blood!
