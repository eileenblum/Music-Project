[Chapter I : Gathering Of The Damned]

The love of Shadowhall
The curse of Shadowhall

[Chapter II : Under The Bloodmoon]

It's the legacy of my family,
We've been sleeping well for a decade
Our breed is doomed, a family affair
Time to wake up, it's a new decade

No use in trying to break the chains,
We're bound to this evil curse
There's just one thing to keep us alive
A young girl's blood to feed the curse

Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
We are the living dead
Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
The dream of the living dead
Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
We are the living dead
Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
The dream of the living dead

The time is now for my tribe to come
And gather around for my wedding
Can't wait to meet my dying bride
She'll live forever after our marriage

A deadly kiss and she'll be mine,
The special guest for our feast
Her blood will feed the hungry breed
Come be my guest, come join the feast!

Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
We are the living dead
Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
The dream of the living dead
Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
We are the living dead
Alive Under The Bloodmoon, The Bloodmoon
The dream of the living dead

[Chapter III : Open The Gates]

It's time to welcome the family
They've been hiding in their graves
Been such a long time, long time -- no see
It's time to open the gates

So come on in and join the feast with me
You have been resting for too long

I'm serving fresh blood for you an me
The silvermoon, she makes us strong

Open The Gates, let them come in
They've been sleeping for too long
Open The Gates, let them join in
It's good to see you, come on!

Hundreds of years, hundreds of gatherings
We have to do this to live on
I am the keeper of the vampire flame
Trust in me, and you'll live on

And if you ask of my opinion
It's a blessing, not a curse

I am immortal, I am the holy one
So tell me, how can this ever be a curse?

Open The Gates, let them come in
They've been sleeping for too long
Open The Gates, let them join in
It's good to see you, come on!
Open The Gates, let them come in
They've been sleeping for too long
Open The Gates, let them join in
It's good to see you, come on!

[Chapter IV : Shadowhall]

Have a seat, you may sit down,
Nice to see you all around
But don't expect exotic fish
I serve a very special dish.

I may now introduce to you
The girl, I will get married to
Although I haven't met her yet
For sure, she'll be my perfect pet

She's so young, oh, she's so sweet
Innocent blood, will be our sweet drug at midnight

I'll give her love, I'll bring life
She'll be my wife -- an immortal existence

So long I've been waiting,
So long I've been yearning
So long I've been starving for blood

The beast deep within me
Is trying to break free
A hunger I just cannot stop

So long I've been waiting,
So long I've been yearning
A dream full of satanic lust

The beast deep within me
Is trying to break free
Good, clean entertainment, that you just can trust!

You're the girl of my dreams
I will kiss a away your fears
Be my bride, stay with me
Hear my call
Stay with me, by my side
Be my one beloved bride
Be the lady for Lord Shadowhall

You're the girl of my dreams
I will kiss a away your fears
Be my bride, stay with me
Hear my call
Stay with me, by my side
Be my one beloved bride
Be the lady for Lord Shadowhall

I can feel my wild heart beat
Oh yeah, by far, she's way too sweet
And when I touch her golden hair
It makes me shiver everywhere

Maybe, I'd tame the beast in me
This time not to be running free
What is this thing, that I do feel
Inside a dark heart, love is real

Shadowhall
Shadowhall
Shadowhall

[Chapter V : Vampire's Ball]

C'mon babe, c'mon babe and dance with me
I show you love for the whole world to see
I will never, never ever leave you
Leave you again, my dear

Oh, this love is forever
What I've been waiting for
Oh, love until the end of never
So true, so deep for sure!

Oh, this love is forever
Oh, what I've been waiting for
Oh, love until the end of never
More than lust, I never wanted more!

C'mon babe, c'mon babe and dance with me
We're one, you're the center of the world for me
Let me hold you, never lose you
Never ever do you no harm..

Oh, this love is forever
What I've been waiting for
Oh, love until the end of never
So true, so deep for sure!

Oh, this love is forever
What I've been waiting for
Oh, love until the end of never
More than lust, I never wanted more!

The love of a vampire

C'mon babe, c'mon babe and dance with me
I show you love for the whole world to see
I will never, never ever leave you
Leave you again, my dear

[Chapter VI : Hell Dimension]

I see it so clear, now is the time to break from the family tradition
Break from the curse, break all the chains, find what we've always been missin'
This girl is the healer
The prophet of change
Now is the time
To rearrange

I -- was blinded by life without love
I -- needed a little help from above
Now -- don't tell me 'bout our destiny
Now -- now is the time to shake free!

Fight this evil -- escape from this hell dimension
Trust your feelings -- they lead you from hell dimension
Fight this evil -- escape from this hell dimension
Trust your feelings -- they lead you from hell dimension

I look in their eyes, but all I can see, is hatred and hunger and fever
They don't understand, just what I have found, I am a true believer
I'll be your messiah
The prophet of change
Now is the time
To rearrange

I -- was blinded by life without love
I -- needed a little help from above
Now -- don't tell me 'bout our destiny
Now -- now is the time to shake free!

Fight this evil -- escape from this hell dimension
Trust your feelings -- they lead you from hell dimension
Fight this evil -- escape from this hell dimension
Trust your feelings -- they lead you from hell dimension

[Chapter VII -- Love Under Ice]

all that I have loved, all that I have truly believed in
all hope is gone, killed by my very own breed

I'm buried alive, frozen, not killed here under the ice&amp;
So deep
Under the ice

She's lying beside me, this is our love under ice
Love under ice
Love under ice
Love under ice
