High up on the hillside I was standing in the rain,
I was waiting for a sign to come
Longing for an answer, I was asking once again,
wanted to know, what was about to come.

Absolute darkness, no stars, no moon around
I was looking down the waters edge
I saw the waves, the ocean's sacred sound
So paralysing, got me jumping off the edge!

I felt the water, so cold, but oh so free
I felt the magic, the passion of the sea
There was no fear, no hate controlling me
Absolute freedom, only life surrounding me

all that I do believe in
lies in my own secret eden
Crystal Stone Island

I'm done with compromising
Let loose and stop my hiding
Crystal Stone Island

Was drifting through the darkness, the coldness of the flood
My final voyage had just begun
Deeper in the ocean, the stream was my cold blood
Addicted to the darkness, I didn't need no sun

I was sinking deeper, (but) I didn't feel no pain
I couldn't move no more and I was drifting on
The icy water was pumping through my veins
I took my final breath and nothing could go wrong
