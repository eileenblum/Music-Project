The morning they came, like the sun did not want to rise
A star in the night, like the gods came down to earth
Darkness around, not a sound, not a cry, not a single sigh
The priestress was killed, because she did not see the signs

Then they felt the thunder - A blazing sword of destruction
Then the alien came

Their eyes like silver - like the light of a new born star
When the alien came

A starship from the sky
No prophecy knew why
This is the kingdom of light

Destroyed this holy land
Built upon desert sand
The mystic gods from the sky

It's the star, it's the Stardawn

They brought them machines, breathing fire, shooting all their kings to dust
"Worship and pray, and your land will rise!
It will last over eons, it will last, all my children, all you need is trust!"
The new gods' prophecy, fate under stardawned skies!

Then they felt the thunder - A blazing sword of destruction
Then the alien came

Their eyes like silver - like the light of a new born star
When the alien came

A starship from the sky
No prophecy knew why
This is the kingdom of light

Destroyed this holy land
Built upon desert sand
The mystic gods from the sky

It's the star, it's the Stardawn
