I feel this dark and cloudy shadow over me
Tried to forget all that I didn't wanna see

Oh, I never believed
No I never wanted to bleed
I never ever really believed
I never really believed

Was facing the truth, felt the pain, but you will remain&amp;
(right here)

I Ain't No Hero
I Ain't No Hero
The love that I feel is all I can give

I Ain't No Hero
I Ain't No Hero
Only the love and the pain left, that's me

I got no tears left to share and to give
Been hiding your eyes for so long, far too long

Oh, I never believed
No I never wanted to bleed
I never ever really believed
I never really believed

Was facing the truth, felt the pain, but you will remain&amp;
(right here)

I Ain't No Hero
I Ain't No Hero
The love that I feel is all I can give

I Ain't No Hero
I Ain't No Hero
Only the love and the pain left, that's me

Right here, where all of your love's kept
Right here, where all of your love is left
Right here,
Right here
Right here
