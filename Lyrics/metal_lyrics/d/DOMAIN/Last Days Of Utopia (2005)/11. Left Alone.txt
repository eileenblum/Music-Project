[Music: Axel Ritt, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

Been stranded here, on the shores of this island
And what I found was paradise
But all my dreams, destroyed by my own hands
I was fool, I brought evil to life!

What have I done?
What's left to do?

In an endless ocean
The only one left here, still searching for truth

Left alone, in this ocean left alone
Dying all alone, for all that I've done
Left alone, got my fears all by me own
Crying all alone, for all I've become

My life is wasted, I've ruined all I loved
I'm drowning here left all alone

A new home on the streets of Utopia
All that I was looking for
They gave me love, I brought them pain and I
I'm the only one to blame for sure

Why am I alive?
How can I live, live on?

In an endless ocean
The only one left here, still cheating the truth

Left alone, in this ocean left alone
Dying all alone, for all that I've done
Left alone, got my fears all by me own
Crying all alone, for all I've become

My life is wasted, I've ruined all I loved
I'm drowning here left all alone
