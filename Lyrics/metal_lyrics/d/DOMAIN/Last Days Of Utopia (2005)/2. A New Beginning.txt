[Music: Axel Ritt, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

This is my new beginning, another life to come
This is my new beginning, gonna make my dreams come true

Don't look for perfect living, don't look for perfect love
As long as this time living, makes this man feel like a man

Paradise for me across the sea
Paradise just waits for me and
I will never be the same

Utopia lies over the sea
Utopia for a man like me
When the horizon will meet the sky
I will find my new home where all souls can fly

Utopia lies over the sea
Utopia for a man like me
My new sense of living, is what I will find
Gonna leave all my guilt and my past behind

This is my new beginning, been waiting for too long
This is my new beginning, leave all troubles far behind

All of my lust for freedom, all of my hope for peace
All of the dreams and yearning, I will find across the sea

Paradise  my dreams of liberty
Paradise just waits for me and
I will never be the same

Utopia lies over the sea
Utopia for a man like me
When the horizon will meet the sky
I will find my new home where all souls can fly

Utopia lies over the sea
Utopia for a man like me
My new sense of living, is what I will find
Gonna leave all my guilt and my past behind
