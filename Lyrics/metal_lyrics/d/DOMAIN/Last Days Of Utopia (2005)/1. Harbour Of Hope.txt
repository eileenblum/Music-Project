[Music: Axel Ritt, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

Harbour of Hope - on a proud ship I will sail, my own fairytale
Far from this land, I'll be free

Harbour of Hope - where a new life waits for me, my new reality
Over the ocean I'll be free

Harbour of Hope - dreams are sailing
Harbour of Hope - I will be free again
