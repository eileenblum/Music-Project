[Music: Axel Ritt, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

I see the storm clouds coming, I see the rising of the waves
Above the dark horizon, I feel the ocean as it quakes

Wind and rain, at war again
The ocean fights,
this lonely ship tonight

But we're sailing on, to a distant shore
Still the ocean fights
All my hopes and dreams

Don't wanna die
