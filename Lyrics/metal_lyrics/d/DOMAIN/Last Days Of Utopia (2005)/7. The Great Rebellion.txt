[Music: Axel Ritt, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

I'm spending my days, they rush like a stream
with a girl by my side, my life seems like a dream
some storm under surface, it breaks out like hell
people spreading ideas like they're under a spell

and as I'm understanding,
just what it is, they're preaching
finally I'm realizing,
it's my life, that they are teaching!

I can't fight flames, it's burning like hell
I can't stop this Great Rebellion
Like a spark to a flame, a virus of my name
I started this Great Rebellion

It's time for some new days, reach higher and higher
There must be life beyond beauty
Let's explore some new ways, some' new to desire
There must be life beyond beauty

Faster than bullets, they spread the disease
A world flamed with anger, not harmony and peace
It's gods against men, it's young against old
And it's growing much stronger, with the stories, I've told

and as I'm understanding,
just what it is that they're preaching
finally I'm realizing,
it is my life, they are teaching!

I can't fight flames, it's burning like hell
I can't stop this Great Rebellion
Like a spark to a flame, a virus of my name
I started this Great Rebellion

It's time for some new days, reach higher and higher
There must be life beyond beauty
Let's explore some new ways, some' new to desire
There must be life beyond beauty

Rebellion Rebellion Rebellion Rebellion Rebellion Rebellion
