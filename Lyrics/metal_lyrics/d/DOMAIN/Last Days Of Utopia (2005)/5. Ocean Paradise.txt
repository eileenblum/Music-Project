[Music: Axel Ritt / Erdmann Lange, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

As I'm walking across the sand see the seabirds flying by
red and blue and golden and a smell like paradise
I see flowers blooming bright and a rainbow in the sky
silhouettes surrounding me, ten thousand butterflies

Statues of silver and gold are leading my way
there's a city across the light, there are waterfalls aside
some people cross my sight smiling friendly at me
they seem surprised, but they're asking me to stay

There can't be greater life than here
nothing more beautiful than ocean paradise
