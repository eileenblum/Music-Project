[Music: Axel Ritt, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

say can you hear, the voices and screams
out there the people are yelling
there's fists in the air, there's rage in their eyes
a riot to bring on the change

there's anger in the air
people from everywhere
are crying out in the streets

there's hatred in their stare
no chance to hide nowhere
the fires are burning tonight!

Is this the end of the world?
This is not what I did seek!
I cannot believe this

Is this Armageddon, Utopia burning
The people are raging, all hell's breaking loose
Is this Armageddon, Utopia dying
Was my fate to kill them and death is the truth?
Is this Armageddon, Utopia burning
The people are raging, all hell's breaking loose
Is this Armageddon, Utopia dying
Disaster and madness is what I did choose!

My own ideas, based on my hopes and fears
Don't wanna be no messiah!
They don't understand, they kill their own land
A lemming-like society!

There's madness in the air
Evil is everywhere
All that I wanted was freedom

Now freedom's breaking loose
Can't stop my raging truth
I can't stop this thing I have started

Is this the end of the world?
This is not what I did seek!
I cannot believe this

Is this Armageddon, Utopia burning
The people are raging, all hell's breaking loose
Is this Armageddon, Utopia dying
Was my fate to kill them and death is the truth?
Is this Armageddon, Utopia burning
The people are raging, all hell's breaking loose
Is this Armageddon, Utopia dying
Disaster and madness is what I did choose!
