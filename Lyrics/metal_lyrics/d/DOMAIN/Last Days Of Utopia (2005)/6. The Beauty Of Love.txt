[Music: Axel Ritt / Erdmann Lange, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

So long, been waiting for, to find love
A piece of heaven
So hard, can't cry no more, where is
My piece of heaven

Out there, I'm sure must be, the one for me
To hold forever
I never thought, I'd find the love I need,
To fall forever

But you are my reason to love my new life
Here on this island I found all I need
Beauty and peace and the love of my life
You're all I need, you're the Beauty Of Love

Cherish the Beauty Of Love
Roses are raining sweet from above
Cherish the Beauty Of Love
A love forever

My days are rushing by, since you're here
So soft and peaceful
Light up my life, my love, your lips they taste
So sweet, so wonderful

Out there, I always knew, must be the one
To hold forever
I never thought, I'd find the love I need
To fall forever

But you are my reason to love my new life
Here on this island I found all I need
Beauty and peace and the love of my life
You're all I need, you're the Beauty Of Love

Cherish the Beauty Of Love
Roses are raining sweet from above
Cherish the Beauty Of Love
A love forever

Cherish the Beauty Of Love
Roses are raining sweet from above
Cherish the Beauty Of Love
A love forever

Now I am sure, I'll never leave again
I am so sure, you made me breathe again
Now that I know
that I can't live another life
without you

Cherish the Beauty Of Love
Roses are raining sweet from above
Cherish the Beauty Of Love
A love forever
