[Music: Axel Ritt, Lyrics: Carsten Schulz]

On the first day of the rain people felt no fear or pain
they were surprised, so surprised

but as the rainbows did not rise
animals out for disguise

This will turn to endless rain  sent from the gods above
Hide from this endless rain  the gods locked away their love
This will turn to endless rain  sent from the gods above
Hide from this endless rain  the gods locked away their love

They locked away all their love

as the second month began there was barely no dry land
is this the end, the end?

at night the women cried
no more seabirds were in sight

This will turn to endless rain  sent from the gods above
Hide from this endless rain  the gods locked away their love
This will turn to endless rain  sent from the gods above
Hide from this endless rain  the gods locked away their love

locked away their love
away their love
away their love

Anger, water, sent from the heavens
Storm clouds cover the moon and the sun
Rain, storm and thunder, a god-given vengeance
Terror and pain  terror and pain
Terror and pain from this endless&amp;

This will turn to endless rain  sent from the gods above
Hide from this endless rain  the gods locked away their love
This will turn to endless rain  sent from the gods above
Hide from this endless rain  the gods locked away their love

locked away their love
away their love
away their love
