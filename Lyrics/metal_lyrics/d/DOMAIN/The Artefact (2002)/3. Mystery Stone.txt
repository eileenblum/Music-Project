Out in the fields, over hills and mountains
Far from the blood we all came from

The source of our dreams and ancient legends
A fountain of truth for those who believe

Come with me, dream with me
There's much more than the eye can see
Free your feel, feel your dream
Don't hide from what you know should be

We're on the quest for the Mystery Stone
There's more to reach in your life
There's more to find if you believe
We're on the quest for the Mystery Stone
The magic of the freedom that lies in everyone
Hey!

They come from the valleys, the hills and the desert
The magical spirit will guide us all

Search for the truth, search for the blind faith
Long lost inside your frozen heart

Come with me, dream with me
There's much more than the eye can see
Free your feel, feel your dream
Don't hide from what you know should be

We're on the quest for the Mystery Stone
There's more to reach in your life
There's more to find if you believe
We're on the quest for the Mystery Stone
The magic of the freedom that lies in everyone
Hey!

Come with me, dream with me
There's much more than the eye can see
Free your feel, feel your dream
Don't hide from what you know should be

We're on the quest for the Mystery Stone
There's more to reach in your life
There's more to find if you believe
We're on the quest for the Mystery Stone
The magic of the freedom that lies in everyone
Hey!
