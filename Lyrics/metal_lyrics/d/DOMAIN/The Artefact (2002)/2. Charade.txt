It's been too long, it's been too far gone
Since the dream of our life went astray
Now I'm here, in a sea of fear
Trying to fight every day

It's deadly, it's vicious
Look what you're doing to me
It's evil, grotesque
What do you want from me?
This drama, so sad
This is not how it should be
Just leave me - alone!
It's all that I have to say!

Ohohoho - let's end this deadly Charade
Ohohoho - let's end this evil Charade

Since you've been gone, my life comes undone
But can't keep from making me bleed
Can't you see, we're not meant to be
We have failed from the very first start

It's deadly, it's vicious
Look what you're doing to me
It's evil, grotesque
What do you want from me?
This drama, so sad
This is not how it should be
Just leave me - alone!
It's all that I have to say!

Ohohoho - let's end this deadly Charade
(It's my life, can't you see?)
Ohohoho - let's end this evil Charade
Ohohoho - let's end this deadly Charade
Ohohoho - let's end this evil Charade
(This was never meant to be)

Out of my life - let's end this deadly Charade
(It's my life, can't you see?)
Free from this live - please end this evil Charade
Ohohoho - let's end this deadly Charade
Ohohoho - let's end this evil Charade
