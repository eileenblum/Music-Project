Wintertime is fading
Feel the sun comes up again
And the night becomes my friend
This special scent just fills the air

Wintertime is fading
My own heart pushes me up
And the night becomes my friend
Everything seems to awake
Springtime's getting higher
Feel the heat is coming out
Yes the night's the place to be
My lover's sweat to cover me

Everything's to change
Time to rearrange
Time to live and be reborn again

Everything's to die
It's the way of life
A change of seasons is right here tonight

I see circles when I look above to the moon
(Circles 'round sun and moon)
Shades of grey while my eyes try to reach for the sun
(Circles 'round sun and moon)

Summer's growing colder
Still the air is full of sound
And the music's slowing down
Still there's magic all around

And when fall is falling
Shadows growing far too long
Yearning, howling at the moon
Everything just starts again

Everything's to change
Time to rearrange
Time to live and be reborn again

Everything's to die
It's the way of life
A change of seasons is right here tonight

I see circles when I look above to the moon
(Circles 'round sun and moon)
Shades of grey while my eyes try to reach for the sun
(Circles 'round sun and moon)
