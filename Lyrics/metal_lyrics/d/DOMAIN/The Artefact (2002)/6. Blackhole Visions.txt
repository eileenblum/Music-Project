It's time to make my final decision
I'm gonna leave this cruel world
Don't wanna go in this any deeper
Don't wanna hide from my own hurts

Can't face my demons
Struggling in my head
Can't keep the voices from screaming
I am about to explode

No longer run, no longer hide
No more denying what's burning inside

Can't kill this pain, a soul on the run
This resurrection's already begun

Drowning myself, drowning my past
Knowing that my inner pressure would last

No longer run, no longer hide
No more denying what's burning inside

I will use this fever - time to make decisions
No more broken dreams and no more Blackhole Visions
I will drown my sorrow - it's the right decision
No more broken dreams and no more Blackhole Visions

And now the dark side of my heart
Controls my every move
It feels so good letting myself go
This life can give so much more

Can't face this chaos, ruling my head

My life's been wasted for so long
And now it's time for a change!

No longer run, no longer hide
No more denying what's burning inside

Can't kill this pain, a soul on the run
This resurrection's already begun

Drowning myself, drowning my past
Knowing that my inner pressure would last

No longer run, no longer hide
No more denying what's burning inside

I will use this fever - time to make decisions
No more broken dreams and no more Blackhole Visions
I will drown my sorrow - it's the right decision
No more broken dreams and no more Blackhole Visions

(Oh no) How can I believe in me
(Oh no) Waiting so long to be free
(Oh no) How can I believe in me
(Oh no) Waiting so long to be free
(Oh no) How can I believe in me
(Oh no) Waiting so long to be free
