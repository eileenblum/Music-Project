C'mon!

Experience XTC, the time is right for me
Forget my troubles, leave 'em behind
Experience XTC, the time is right for me
Follow my spirit, my heart leads the way

Don't need no Ecstasy, these pills don't work with me
Don't need no feeder in no chemistry
The only one is me, the only way to be
I'm standing taller than I've ever been

I - I only live for the moment
Tomorrow can wait
I wipe off the dirt all the time

Experience XTC, the time is right for me
Forget my troubles, leave 'em behind
Experience XTC, the time is right for me
I'm not what others just want me to be

It's my life can't you see, my own philosophy
I've grown from all of the things I have done
Bareepdadeepdadee - live it in dignity
Rise up with all of your feelings so strong

I - I only live for the moment
Tomorrow can wait
I wipe off the dirt all the time

C'mon

Experience XTC, Experience XTC
Experience XTC, Experience XTC
Experience XTC, Experience XTC

I - I only live for the moment
Tomorrow can wait
I wipe off the dirt all the time
