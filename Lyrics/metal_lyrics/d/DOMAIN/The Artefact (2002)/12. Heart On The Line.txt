Well I've always been a dreamer
I've always tried my best to be free, so free
But as soon as you start trying
You're half way where you're losing yourself

No one ever should be cheatin'
Only true love hurts
I can't trust my heart so blue (my heart so blue)
Don't believe in what I'm feelin'
Only true love hurts
I know I should be over you

Heart On The Line, Heart On The Line
I feel that my heart this time is just doing time
Stop wasting my time, chasing my time
Stop fighting this love with my heart on
Heart On The Line

When your heart is bleedin'
It's way too hard to find what you need
It's like searching for a new love
Love strikes like lightning, takes you by storm, by storm

No one ever should be cheatin'
Only true love hurts
I can't trust my heart so blue (my heart so blue)
Don't believe in what I'm feelin'
Only true love hurts
I know I should be over you

Heart On The Line, Heart On The Line
I feel that my heart this time is just doing time
Stop wasting my time, chasing my time
Stop fighting this love with my heart on
Heart On The Line
