Lonely sidewalks, neon mirrors
Beating of a stone cold heart
Concrete feelings, keep on breathing
Dusty perfume in the dark

I'm cruising still here in
Bleeding still

This is Downtown Babylon

I welcome you here in
Fears come true

This is neon darkness
This is Downtown Babylon

Cheap romancing, body's boiling
Souls lost in the wishing-well
Burning bridges, gutter divas
Fall in love with agony

I'm cruising still here in
Still bleeding

This is Downtown Babylon

I welcome you here in
Fears come true

This is neon darkness
This is all that matters
This is street-life dreaming
This is concrete yearning
These are instant feelings
This is neon darkness
This is all that matters
Life in Downtown Babylon

I welcome you here in
Fears come true
This is Downtown Babylon

I'm cruising still here in
Bleeding still

This is neon darkness
I welcome you here in
Fears come true
Welcome you here in
Fears come true
Welcome you

Downtown, Downtown, Downtown
