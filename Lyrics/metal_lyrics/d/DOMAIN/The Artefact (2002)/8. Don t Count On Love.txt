Count on love - uuh yeah!
Count on love - whoohoo
Don't count on, don't count on

Count on love - oh won't you count on love my baby
Count on love
Don't count on, don't count on

Blue-eyed darlin', young and sweet
Dreams of a lovin', to set her free
Tries to hold on to her dream
Waits for someone to make her feel

Cries herself to sleep tonight
No one here to hold her tight - no

Bittersweet, the hurting kind
All she ever kept inside
Dared to share her dreams at night
No one here to hold her tight

Don't Count, Don't Count on Love
You can get more from life, than you're dreaming of
Oh honey
Don't Count, Don't Count on Love
Lonely nights
Don't last forever

Count on love
Don't count on, don't count on

Shy little schoolgirl far from home
In the arms of a stranger she feels so alone
On the hunt every evening, she broke a thousand hearts
Never stays forever - she is gone!

Cries herself to sleep tonight
No one here to hold her tight, no, no, no

Bittersweet, the hurting kind
All she ever kept inside
Dared to share her dreams at night
No one here to hold her tight

Don't Count, Don't Count on Love
You can get more from life, than you're dreaming of
Oh honey
Don't Count, Don't Count on Love
Lonely nights
Don't last forever

Count on love - oh won't you count on love, my baby
Count on love
Don't count on, don't count on
