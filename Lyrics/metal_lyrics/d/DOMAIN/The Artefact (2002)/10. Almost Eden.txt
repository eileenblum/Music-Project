I am far away from heaven, time turns to the great escape, the great escape
I've been stranded here forever, some other place where no one waits, no one waits forever

Free, sailing on a sea of dreams
Life, nothing's ever what it seems
Time to get some living

This is Almost Eden, just what I believe in
Don't hang on, won't be gone
This is Almost Eden, more than I have needed
I'll stay strong, from now on
I will be
The one that you can always lean on
The one that you have always dreamed of
Almost Eden

We are flying with the angels, we don't need no heaven to feel free, to feel free
Our hearts pounding like a big drum, leading the way to another dream, but we are far from dreaming

Near, where we've been before (where we've never been before)
Now, closer to a different shore (getting closer now)
Time to start believing

This is Almost Eden, just what I believe in
Don't hang on, won't be gone
This is Almost Eden, more than I have needed
I'll stay strong, from now on
I will be
The one that you can always lean on
The one that you have always dreamed of
Almost Eden, Almost Eden
Almost Eden

Hold on to a dream, close to me
Hold on to a dream, trust in me

This is Almost Eden, just what I believe in
Don't hang on, won't be gone
This is Almost Eden, more than I have needed
I'll stay strong, from now on
I will be
The one that you can always lean on
The one that you have always dreamed of
The one that you can always turn to
The one that you can always run to
Almost Eden
Almost Eden

Almost Eden - Almost Eden - Almost
