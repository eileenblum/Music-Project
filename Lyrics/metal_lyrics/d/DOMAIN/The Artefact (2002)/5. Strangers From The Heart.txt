Something pulls me back to you
Something makes me "hiding away"
Hard to be strong, when it feels go inside
Trying to lose control

My own heart still longs to see
What my eyes have never dared to touch
Holding me back, when I need to let go
It's not how it's meant to be

So hard to stay away from you - so hard to stay apart
Can't keep myself from touching you - still we're
Strangers from the Heart

Counting the days, the hours we spent
Writing letters I will never sent
I know this is wrong but it feels good inside
Heaven is where you are

So hard to stay away from you - so hard to stay apart
Can't keep myself from touching you - still we're
Strangers From The Heart

Still it's my life that I'm living
This is what I did choose
I just can't keep from feelin'
But there is so much left to lose!

So hard to stay away from you - so hard to stay apart
Can't keep myself from touching you - still we're
Strangers From The Heart
