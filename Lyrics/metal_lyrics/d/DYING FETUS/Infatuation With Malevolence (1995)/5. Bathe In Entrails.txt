I Can Still Remember, That Night In Paris France, Enslaved Upon The Darkness, That Boiling Acid Bath, Bathing In His Sick Tub, Flooding With Entrails, Unto This Fucking World, Horror Is Revealed, Eyes Are Melting, Vile And Horrifying, Sordid, Suffering, Horrid Eviscreation, Nerves Exploding, A Sicklu Revelation, I Watched Them Die...Skin Is Peeling, Dripping Of Their Faces, Veins Are Bursting, So Morbidly Deformed, Sawed And Severed, Nothing Left To Pray For, Rot Forever, I Felt The Growing Sickness Of Decomposing Organs Rotting Right Before Me, So Heavenly Dismantled, As I Watched Him, Unforgiving, Eyes Of Terror, Melting Humans, Spilling Over, Cleansing My Skin, With Your Organs, With Your Blood
