As I Climb The Ancient Walls I Find Voices Of The Dead Whisper To My Ears And Pull Me In The Spirit World, Brilliant, Evil, The Song Of The Dead, Born From The Verses That Catharsis Bred, The Words, Text, How They All Deceive, Bludgeoned Martyr, He's The One Who Believed, Severed Alliance, Away From The Son, Towards Blackness Our Salvation Has Come, Laughing, Crying The Ones Who Must Die, Wander Forever Because They're Dying Inside, The Cross Above, Carries The Light, Enthralled, Entombed To A Meaningless Fight, There Is No "Retribution For The Dead", Exit, Depart, My Destination Is The World Below, You Will Suffer In Unbridled Torment Given Birth To The Fate, Under This Inhuman Passage They Surround...Purged Me Of My Worldly Being Cast Aside This Skin That Lies, Lurid Chants Of Devistation Fill The Air With Wisdom's Truth, Summon Forth, Testament, I Am Born To Be Dead Again
