Stripped To Worthlessness, Raped Of Existence, Enter This World Of Sin, Vomit Forth The Newborn's Life, Gazing Inside The Hideous Deformity, Blasphemous Delight, Chop Their Heads Away And Die With Me, Step Within The Circle, Let The Fear Just Slip Away, Ripped Apart You'll Fullfill As Your Join The Dead, Underneath The Full Moon Which Dance Before, Leaviate, Unearthly Fate Your Body Drains, Ripped Apart The Fetus Mangled On The Floor, Your Gutted Corpse Has Deceased Embryo, Dead On The Floor Bless This Day, They're Suffering, Embryo Vomited, Then This World Will Be Blessed, Corpse Torn, Diluted, The Fetal Soul Is Horribly Torn
