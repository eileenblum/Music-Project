Stare In My Eyes, The Window To Your Soul, A Vision Of The Prophecy At Hand, Entranced And Decieved, You Fall Onto Your Knees, Give To Me The Pleasure I Demand, I Just Go By Instinct, There Is No Thought Out Plan, A Search For Penetration, A Lust Dream Of The Damned, Your Body Now Forgotten, It's Safe Within My Hands, Your Flesh Is My Salvation, The Sanctity Of Man, We're All The Same, An Existenctialst's Nightmare, Creation, A Purpose Inane, Death, An End, Dimmensional Crossing, A Spirite, Evolved Profane, Fornicate, A Quest For Self Pleasure, Undenied I Rise, Afterlife, The Desperate Measure, Soveriegn Sacrafice, Ascension From The Dawn, Iconoclast Enthroned, Hope Is All But Gone, A Harbinger Alone, Dilute My Blood With Yours, Acquire To The Taste, Carrier Of What I Need, Your Blood Shall Be My Wine! Feel The Blood Run Through You And Into Me, A Fluid I Belong To, An Epicure, Streangth From The Induldgent, I Extricate, True Exaserbation, An Anathema, This Is The Start Of What's To Come, With The Dying Breath Of The Chosen One, We'll Turn Your Many Into None, From Hell Your God To Begotten Son, No Remorse For The Fallen, A Reason To Be Served, A Bloodbath Mate Recieved My Hate, Not A Victim Just My Whore, A Taste Your Mouth Cannot Fathom, On Excess It Will Appease
