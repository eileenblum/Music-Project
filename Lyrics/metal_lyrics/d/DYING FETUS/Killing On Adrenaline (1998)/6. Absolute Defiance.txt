I feel the pressure, it boils in my veins
there will be no praying, for peace, no sacrifice
as I feel the burning, of hate, it's blinding me
I just live to, destroy, my mortal enemies
I just see the face that's, the target, in my mind
and with pleasure, carve it, and cut it
from your head, there - is - no - rea - son
its just a, laugh for me
cause you lost my patience, and with it
goes your life, your existence, a parody
there's no excuse I can believe
one time, is all it takes, to rip the flesh from off your face
die die die just fucking die die die just fucking die
with puppet strings, and faking lies
a hollow head, and empty eyes
take your breath, and let it go
the last one you'll ever know
die die die just fucking die die die just fucking die
habitual complacency conforms your life away
it does not take a lot of thought to follow and obey
the dead fucking traitor has no reason to complain
a lifeless bag of shit with no face and with no name
I just have no patience for the scum of the earth
why not kill these fuckers, make them die, make it hurt
worthless global breeders crawl like roaches on my back
a pestilence of hyper-active idiots on crack
I choose not to follow all the prophets preaching greed
to the close-minded corpses that consume beyond need
