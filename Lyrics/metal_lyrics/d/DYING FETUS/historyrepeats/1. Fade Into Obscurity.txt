[originally by Dehumanized]Propaganda, malicious lies
Escaping from ignorant minds
Jealousy overpowers
As you lose control of yours
Anger and rage boils inside
No control, madness expelled
False expressions taking forth
Infect the world with lies

Living in a world full of chaos
Afraid to face humanity
Try to keep the truth suppressed
Drifting towards extinction

Strip you of your soul and your mind
You have no more control
Now the truth has been exposed to
All who believed your false words
Nobody is left to listen
Your words fall on deaf ears
All of your blind followers
Now have opened their eyes!

Jealousy, within your mind
Contradicting, reality
Demented, way to live
Failure, waste of life

Damage has been done, revenge shall be mine
Silenced for eternity, the end is now beginning

Propaganda, malicious lies
Escaping from ignorant minds
Jealousy overpowers
As you lose control of yours

Your words have stricken me
I am forced to act out my hate
Reached the point of insanity
Revenge has taken its toll
