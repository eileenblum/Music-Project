Scores upon scores, what vengeance is right?
Where did all this shit originate?
Spiral of endless unlawful death
Wildfire of hatred, barbaric vice

Fighting for their own opression, absolute allegiance, unrestrained killing
without cause
Wanton psychopathic action, rabid empty conscience, indelible, never
satisfied

Paranoia, offensive escalation, pointless bloodshed, hopelessly consumed
Mobs of irate radicals, fanatical devotion
Brute force, worn out, know nothing else, their life is hell, death gives
them purpose

Vacant sense of their own worth, unsanctioned war, destruction
Misdirected anger, reactionary homicide

Retaliation, adolescent grasp of culpability, bringing others misery
Taking out their fury on someone else
Cold-blooded prejudice, slaughtering innocents

Death is all that matters, trade their life for mass murder
Poised to inflict mass suffering and pain
Genocide, prophesied, condoned by the word

Misperceiving truth, inducements to explosive violence, decimation is their
sole intention
Suicidal terrorists keep squandering their lives, meaningless sacrifice
Another generation, to serve a vengeful incarnation, dying for a useless
cause

Constant aggressors, born antagonists, permanent ignorance
Decades behind, they steal technology, immoral misuse

Paranoia, escalation, pointless bloodshed, no horror spared
Cheap vain murder, know nothing else, brute force, worn out, a world of shit
Short-sighted spiritual poverty, desperate search to fill a hollow void
Lying in wait for a weakness, exploiting any vulnerability

Children, who'll die while they're young - stupid, more wasted life
Monstrous, desensitized dictator, orders them to die
Violent assault, presuming salvation awaits beyond
No hope for their future, they war unto their end

Dysfunction, poisoned, ignorance reigns
The cycle protects it's own, momentum impedes it's change
Corrupted young minds die, old minds alike succumb
Totalitarian seduction, it's a fucking lie
