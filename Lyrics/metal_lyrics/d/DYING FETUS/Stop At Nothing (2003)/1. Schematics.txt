Unweaving strands of failure
Propagating the obscene
Intentions gone asunder
Tearing down the human facade
(I will give life) Relentless pursuit of action
(I will decide) The traits that blind humanity
(Regenerate) Reliving the generations
(A boundless chain) Correcting their mistakes

Solutions we seek to our mortality
Tampering in greed, inflated arrogance
Nature's course diverted, by men who interfere
Rampant emptiness, reject this world

Blindly seizing solace in easily spun lies
Mutations in the genome chain improve our quality of life
Blindly seizing refuge in ten billion dollar lies
We're consumed by both sides, then shit out to die

Living this undying prophecy, resurrect what should remain dead
Fleshing out this unspoken travesty, all of us fight this unholy war
Sinking into a mockery of truth, we become miskeepers of mankind
Unrestrained avarice, we would become God

Magnified self-preservation, living disease
Inured, soulless, dull vanity
A system of subjugation, order constrained
Hordes of drones, just for more

buying into everything, the pulpit of lies
The path to truth is frozen, politicized
Stuffing the world full of vagrant inbred drones
To control who they are

Instinct, we breed, compulsively
Regeneration epidemic, simulate reality
Suspend a mass, monopolized
Triumphs of technology, the maladjusted ciphers
Perverse, corrupt power scheme
Meddling incompetence, creating minds that misfire
Who will survive?
