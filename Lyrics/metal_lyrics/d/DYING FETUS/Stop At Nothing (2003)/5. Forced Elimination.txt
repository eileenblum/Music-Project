Societal advancement, an agenda of control
Forcing the elimination of hereditary flaws
Licensed breeding protocol, man's course decided
Incarcerating violaters
Their spawn aborted, state required forfeit

Human perfection far beyond our grasp
Cut out random flaws, leaving glitches behind them
Talents that lay dormant, left withered in the womb
Pre-determined course, they take no chances

Sleep, submit, obey, accept it
Nature rejected, culture forgotten
Dwell in their complacency
Drop your defenses, swallow their bullshit
Close down all your doubtful dreams
They will not happen, you don't have it in you
Their emotions stripped away
The depth of man measured, proudly dismissed

Traits that bear malignant traces, recognized without a cure
Magnify the scorn upon the disadvantaged
Living off the toil of others, the rich inflate themselves
Treading on their laborers, burdened by destitution

Born to be slaves, from birth the rich own them
Rigid system, caste of reproduction
Sequence profile, science of misplaced trust
Tyrants protect their own

Propagate subordination
Despondence, contrived alignment
Oppression, induce class hatred
Insurgents revolt against them

Disregard their vacant morals
Interrupt their hoarded power
They will fall, the balance will shift
Overturn their world of shit
