Disgraceful, the evil done by false prophets in God's name
Profit from intimidating poor, lost souls into the flock
Selling a grand facade, pompous posturing in vain
Reinforce spiritual weakness, insecurity

Forgotten essential, freedom of choice
All goodness is discarded, kindness affected
Right or wrong, coerce the congregation mob
To abide your tumid words, the only god they know

Selective agenda with no foundation in truth
Corruption, stumbling block, ruined credibility
Vulgar salesmen growing fat, lies  you tell consume your sheep
Crucify the innocent, absolve yourself with dollar bills

Self-righteous, presuming, cast stones of hypocrisy
Impose your nauseating, senseless fantasy
Built on payment, not contrition, speciously redeemed
Iniquity, punishment on anyone who disobeys

Forgotten essential, the freedom of choice
All goodness is discarded, kindness affected
Selling out redemption you will never grasp
Disgrace all men of faith

Self-righteous, presuming, cast stones of hypocrisy
Impose your nauseating, senseless fantasy
Built on payment, not contrition, speciously redeemed
Iniquity, punishment on anyone who disobeys

Unwillingness to accept reality
Myopic grip on the words of men
Blind loyalty without faith, service to an institution
Betraying trust, and our liberty

Sin of greater depth than those you would save
Blaming tragedy on our intolerance
You spent your life as a sordid pharisee
Unjust, don't be shocked when you're barred from Paradise
