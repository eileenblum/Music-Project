Thirteen years I was locked away,
A life thrown under the wheel.
As each day passed, I never looked back,
Just a beat down body with a mind intact

Counting days inside my head
Set the trap, stab my back, then walk away
Framed and judged, left behind to take the blame
Slam the door, cut the cord, and cast aside

I don't care what it takes, you're fucking dead!

I never used to be so full of hate
It just grew and grew by the hour and day
Dreams of death, cold revenge
Now any means justifies the end

All of my thoughts set to kill
I'm never gonna stop
Until I have your head
No matter how long whatever will come
To end your life is my reason to live

I'll haunt and hunt you down,
Traitor of the brotherhood
Defect and run a once and future failure gone
A trail of schizophrenic lies follow your forgotten steps
As fake laughter hides the serpent tongue behind your breath

Veracity expelled, you thrive on your deceit
Lying comes with ease just like your all-consuming greed
The stroke of midnight passed, the penance hour nears
Each nerve alive with fear, an omen of your ending coming fast

Subjected to a beating
I'll choke the life out from your eyes
Subjected to a beating
Only when you're dead can I be free
And God won't hear you fucking scream

Cold blooded homicide is what it takes to be sure
To put my fist to your face and spill your guts out on the floor
Like a thousand red stabs of pain, for each day I was locked away
You'll taste every ounce of blood as it pours out from what used to be your head

No redemption
No regrets
No excuses
Only death

Execution so long coming, finally attained
Gasping out, last words uttered, only were my name
Pure revenge, all consuming, perfectly arranged
Satisfaction, pure elation, nothing else remains

But one less fucking human on the Earth
