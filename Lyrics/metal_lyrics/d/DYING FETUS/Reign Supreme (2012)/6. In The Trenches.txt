An abomination
The last of a family of filth
Procreator should have pulled out
A fucking waste of sperm
Family scorned abhorrance
Would've done the world a favor
So much aggravation alleviated 
If you were aborted

How pathetic can one be?
Always sinking to new levels
Years ago written off
Cast out for nefarious ways
But had no life, no purpose
So jealous festers within
Feculence excrement
An utmost compliment

Walking pile of shit
With empty words
No decency rectitude
Or credibility
Forthrightness lost
A shallow form of life
A disgrace without integrity
Karma has come to claim

The walking dead

Eradicate, ravage your being
Revulsion intensifies
Persevere until i spill blood
Jubilate as you die
Doors opened wide

The pulse of death has arrived
The sum of all your fears
Exposing all your fucking lies
Limbs crack and split
Raining teeth, blood and spit
Choked screams appear
Yet your begging falls upon deaf ears

In the trenches we meet again
I will reign supreme
Destroy all adversaries
Fuck your enemies
Time and time you fucked me over
You are dead to me
In the trenches we meet again
I will reign supreme
Reign supreme!

Fucking die now
Eat my fucking shit
Annihilation 
I will conquer

To the end i will not stop
Until you reach your timely demise
Lacerate, rip out your throat
Decapitate and shit down your neck
I blackout in extreme pleasure from watching you writhe in pain
Your parasitic existence terminated, piss on your remains
