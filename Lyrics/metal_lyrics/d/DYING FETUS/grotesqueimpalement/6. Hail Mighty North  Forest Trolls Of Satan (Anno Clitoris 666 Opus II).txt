Bitch, now don't ya walk away from me
because you had your chance you fucking whore
you been watching mtv and all you talk abouts down on the floor
cant you tell that you're a slut built for profit
so stay the fuck away from me
you'll see

Bitch, you're always face down, fuck drunk
and I of course (gibberish) again
so tell me why can't ya say no
you're always fucking my bestï»¿ friend
how could I know you were working in porno
just get the fuck away from me
you'll see, you'll see

Baby, if there was one thing I ever thought
I thought we'd beï»¿ together forever
but now you've run away and I'm feelin so lonely
how I long for you to toss my salad
and I to suck your hairy bush
someday when you're beside me again
I know i'll fuck you with my peirced penis
Get down
Bitch! Whore! Cunt! Slut! Bitch!
