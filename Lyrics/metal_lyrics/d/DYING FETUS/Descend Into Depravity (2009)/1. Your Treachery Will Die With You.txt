Anxiety of treachery, wary of the interloper
Never from the circle, the kindred you've confided in

Always from the stranger, is what you would believe?
Cold-blooded betrayal, something not easily forgotten.

Envy was the poisonous effect, flowing through your veins
Of what you should not covet, cowardly disdain
You talked all your shit, you couldn't help yourself
Wanting to divulge, craving to share your exploit
Greed in being the king, naive of the penalty

Reveling secrets, proceeded to deceive
Never seen it coming blinded by camardine

Trust an afterthought, of what would not occur
Reflection powers fury, dominating need to act

Angst of retribution, only fleeting thought dismissed
Desire for revenge, strengthening resolve

Fleeing for respite, antagonism boiling over
Settling at hand, consider your life
Forfeit in every way, repugnance in my sight

Bash your fucking head in; don't feel that will be enough
Mesmerizing in your pain, salt the wound that burdened me
Your suffering is justified, afflict as much as i can bring
Contemplating what you've earned, all this anguish you deserve

Must prolong your agony, persecution cruelty
Carving you up like a pig, warranted distress you live
Vindicated mind-set spreads, all over me like gusting wind
Don't distress because I'm not done, we''ll start all over later as one

Your back-stabbing morals have taken away my life
My conduct in your torture must make it worth it
Haven't thought out this process I've undertaken
Extend you affliction I'll work to keep you aware

Wide awake your torment makes me think of how you act
The all-embracing jealousy hidden surging in your shell
No suspicion on you, loved to play the game of loyalty
Misery saturates all know to find me satisfied

There will be no peace for me now
Distrust for anyone I'll ever encounter
Your treachery will die with you
