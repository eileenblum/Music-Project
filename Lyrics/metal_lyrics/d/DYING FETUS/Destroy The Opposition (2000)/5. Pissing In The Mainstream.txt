The media is a tool designed to mold us into slaves
Drugging us into an empty, apathetic daze.
The trick is that we think that everything is going fine
But the truth to our reality lies buried in the mind

I don't give a fuck about the Hollywood elite;
I don't really care if models can't fucking eat.
I don't give a fuck a fuck about which movie is on top.
But what I really know is that the shit has got to stop.

Consumer appetites are never satisfied in full,
'cause the objects that they buy can simply never fill the void.
A constant need for meaning, and accumulating shit,
drives the lust in their obsession just to get another fix.

I don't give a fuck about the TV ratings game,
The Real World is not a party, just a place for the insane.
If that reflects reality, then pass another drink
You try to be a millionaire, I'll vomit in the sink.

What the fuck is left to try,
on an avaricious nation on an economic high?
If Rome could last 500 years,
who then will throw the wrench inside our gears?

The bottom line is money on the Western power scene,
where celebrities and porn can let the population dream.
They're pathetic human living in an advertising glut,
who devour with a passion what the mainstream vomits up
