Criminal justice system of flaws
Blatant corruption
Repercussions, higher profit
An addiction
The obvious signs of guilt
Sloppy investigation
A bullshit fucking plea
Engineered process
Mishandled evidence unpreserved
Fabricated vindication
Diligence only an illusion
Mitigated, facade of lies
Inundated and ingrained, relentless conditioning
Media, legislation, selling a bent truth sensation
Gorging on the spectacle, "reality" TV
Victims of exploitation, selling out the children
Celebrity and power, attract public bias
Fortitude in decay, swollen avarice
Pedophiles, molesters, murderers set free
When they fail to win, the case falls to settlement
Exposing private perversions, humiliation and disgrace
Destroyed credibility, scamming on both sides
Spending millions to save face, and escape consequence
Attempt to evoke sympathy, inflating reasonable doubt
Lobbyist entitlement, litigation bondage
Egocentric apathy, fraudulent at heart
Judicial prejudice, preferential treatment
Witnesses of falsehood, conviction overturned
Humiliation, concealment and deception
Overexposure of the feeding frenzy
The inspiration to rape the system
Fallen morals, unanswered capital crimes
Circus of reporting, playing up the tragedy
Tainted media opinion, too blind to know the truth
Singular pursuit of profit, seeing what they want to see
Public speculation, slanted sympathies
Tied up in the costly litigation
Overwhelm the prosecution
Truth obscured with stall tactic motions
Trite protection of the guilty
Rats on the grift, indecent intention
Fighting for acquittal and vulgar fame
Quota of scapegoats and distractions
Nonexistent fear of authority
Suffering... Unending... Travesty...
Prejudice... Ignorance... Vanity...
Gold-digging legal battles
Symptom of a lawsuit-crazy nation
Semblance of due diligence
Devious manipulation and omissions
Law enforcement countermanded, weakness of the state
Fucking sheep with bleeding hearts, for no noble cause
No remorse for the victims, preying on the uninformed
Who is held accountable, spectacle of greed
Idiots bringing suit, no matter how absurd
Fabricated testimony, power twisted justice
Public interest in the freak show illustrates the sickness
Privileges of exception, turns to bought freedom
Inundated and ingrained, motions of brute force
Legal rights disintegration, disappearing privacy
Gorging on the spectacle, "reality" TV
Failure of the system, no guilty, but no innocent
Celebrity and power, attract public bias
Setting a precedent, tainting the future
Pedophiles, molesters, freed upon society
Murderers let loose to find their next victim
