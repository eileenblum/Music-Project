Lost my faith in justice
Time does not heal this pain
Defiled my existence
Recurring nightmare
There's no consolation
The awful memories
Constant mind coercion
Instinctive vengeance
I have nothing left to loose now
Only time, regret and anger
Pain to last a hundred lifetimes
Hatred burning, love extinct
Compound insult of bullshit humanism
Misplaced rights, inflame my rage
Vacant cause, offender the victim
Fuck that worthless piece of shit
As long as you live on this earth
Rage unsatisfied
Memories dishonored
Retribution!!!
Giving hardened criminals
Preferential treatment
Settlement, live in prison
Better than you deserve
Jury of your peers, unable to do the job
Obliged by procedure, evidence examination
Now I'm coming for you, there will be no mistrial
Citizen retaliation, the mode of your demise
Moral speculation, some other poor bastard's life
The system has fucked up, left this hollow void
There will be no comfort, this sickness is terminal
Semblance of justice, infuriating lies
Lies arquitted, guilt answered, you will not escape
Cold, my revenge and my blood
Hate, nothing can stop it now
Death, the only end I accept
Hell, punishment I require
Curse, execrate, I must kill
Pain, I inflict merciless
Scream, piercing cries, agony
You should have pled guilty or killed yourself
Unshakable conviction, is all I have to live for
Excruciating terror, the violations you delight in
Useless human excrement, you deserve a life of shit
Make you suffer ruthlessness, I cannot relinquish the honor
Soul I condemn, fucking dead
Nothing will ever be made right again
The path of damnation I hasten you on my way
Every day you lived from then is one more day you owe me
If killing you destroys myself, I wouldn't have it any other way
Fine line between honor and horror, my every action justified
Innocence destroyed, needs anguish to cleanse impurity
Temporary insanity, obeys a singular purpose
Your death row is here and now, the only righteous ending
Die and die again, as I cut and mutilate
You are fucking worthless, I don't give a fuck about you
Blood your insides spayed, placates my hostility
End my days a killer, stripped of everything that mattered
