Just get the fuck down
In cold earth you rot
My fucking hatred
Will not be stopped
Uncontrolled I'm sent into rage
And let the bodies fly
An animal let out of its cage
I am the anti-life
Born under the bowels of the night
A creature undefined
Stomping on the face of a slut
My hate is undenied
Fuck your weakness
No concept of the earth
Your one dimension blinds
Wasting air since birth
You're better left behind
Intelligence deprived
Completely purposeless
I fucking hope you die
I want out of this cark, fucked, decrepit,
Corner of the world
Is there a place, where I can be alone
To think, and do, just what I fucking want
Tell me, tell me, what the fuck to do
the hate, burning, fucking overwhelms
I want, I need, to take a fucking life
Back, the fuck, away
I'm fucking gonna kill, kill, kill
Seconds are like hours floating by
A full fucked ultraviolent high
Tearing down the mother fucking walls
Piece By piece I'll rip your limbs off
Invariably the violence will arrive
Fuck you and fuck your fucking kind
Merciless, weed out the sick
Begging hard, I don't listen
Final scream, can't come too quick
Fuck you all so fucking hopeless
Quickly I proceed to resist
There is no compromise
Deranged I rise to challenge
The joining of your face with my fist
The marriage I prescribe
Helpless you fall so weakened
Ripping at the skin on your face
The pain intensifies
With haste your death is granted
