Dark, crimson tides of blood
Will flow like water into wine
I smell you fear,
Our lives coincide
Please respect, the presence of
The dead
For they weep, they are damned
Spite filled eyes, cold and black
Profane slut of darkness
Let me in your mind
Unholy procreation
I give the gift of life
Fuck your faith and doctrine
I've no concern for lies
In our dying embrace
We coalesce in pain
A heartless, empty shallow way to die
I draw my face up closer to your
Milk white skin
In rivulets tears of blood
Stream slowly down
Rape... Altar stained... Stained
With blood
Lord... Please forgive...
... No response
Faith... Broken pride... Left to die
There's no point in living
Rip your fucking head off
Slut you've lost your privilege
Hate shows no resistance
Fuck your righteous ways
Gone, dead, fucking wasted
With your throat in my hands
Choke your life away
As death comes forth to claim you
I bend my knees and pray
"love it transcends time,
One thousands worlds and more,
Your flesh forever mine
My god damned angel whore..."
