Windswept wasteland
Underneath a Balkan sky
U.N. Peace plan?
Just another fucking lie
Why can't we just kill them all
My contempt is so deep, so strong
5 fucking years through the blood
And the tears
The fuckers hitting us time to fuck
Them all back
No N.A.T.O., no peace, just total
Fucking death
Just killing and dying and
Slaughter and pain
We become what you hate
We can not be expected to exist
With them
Beneath the cross slaves will pray
No return to the past blood is on
Our hands
Burn their homes rape their lands
Forced into the Adriatic, save our lives
Europe is unconscious
What the fuck are "Peace Troops" for?
Time stands so still
Gone, erased, and god forsaken
Peace, a parable of war
Now we wait for retribution
God will punish them in time
Spread the war from Croatia into Belgrade
Kill and fucking kill some more
Have we reached the ending?
Nothing's left alive
And our fucking nation
Will never survive
God left us wanting
(War that never ceased)
What we never could have
(Everlasting peace)
3 fucking races
(Religious enmity)
One fucking land
(For eternity)
