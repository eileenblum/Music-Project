When open skies are battle grounds â The wind becomes my weapon

Dreaming the oceans â As centuries unfold
Breathing the twilight â Like fantasies untold

Dreaming Gotishya â Blood written truth
Dreaming Gotishya â Warriors of doom

Forsaken by promises â Once broken by time

Dreaming the ancient â Scriptures of light
Embracing insanity â Darkening the sight

Dreaming Gotishya â Translating tragedy
Dreaming Gotishya â Soundtrack to misery

[Solo â Aman]

Dreaming the oceans â As centuries unfold
Breathing the twilight â Like fantasies untold
Dreaming Gotishyaâ¦
