Horde of apparitions rising to infinite levels
screaming forth hellfire
Twisted souls marching alongside leviathan
From the abyss they come to destroy the enemy

Annihilate God, torture his followers, wreak havoc on
all who step in our path
The age of Satan has come
Summon the medieval spirits from he seven gates
Destroy the so-called God and his weak son

Spit hellfire upon them, burn them for eternity
Send them to the fiery pit so the spirits that loathe them can torture the despised forever

The christian race is now extinct, heads of all christians impaled on stakes
Their headless bodies crucified upon the crosses of their burning churches

Burn them over fires that have no consumed Christ and his heaven
Spit hellfire upon them, burn them for eternity
Send them to the fiery pit so the spirits that loathe them can torture the despised forever
