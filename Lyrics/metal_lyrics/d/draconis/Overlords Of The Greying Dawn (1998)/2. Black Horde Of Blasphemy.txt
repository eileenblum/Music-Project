Black knights of the apocalypse wage war under blackened skies
The legion of the left hand path will rise under the vision of the moonlight

Forever we will stand against the defenders of the light
We are the children of darkness and dwellers of the night

We were born to murder the world and destroy the leaders of falsity
We will piss on those who do not live by the ways of proper intelligence

We will sit upon the throne of evil and cast destruction upon the mortals
As we watch them deteriorate in pools of their own blood

The glory of the final strike unleashed by Satan's army
Is what we await - the brothers of the black horde
