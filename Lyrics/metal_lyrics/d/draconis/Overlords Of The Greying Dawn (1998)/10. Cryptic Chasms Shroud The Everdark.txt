Buried beneath the earth
Exist the chasms of everdark
Cryptic halls hold the forlorn
inhabitants of eternity
Darkness surrounds and infests
the walls within the underworld
Everlasting damnation awaits for the lost souls

Covered by the dark shroud of eternal grimness
They crawl through dismal halls of the abyss
To reach the infernal domain of fire
Where the burial chamber possesses
souls in flames

The majesty of the burning pit
is the source of diabolical lust
Which draws its victims nearer
to everlasting torture

Spawn of the everdark
Creatures of the abyss
Those, the never-ending eyes
of the master Satan
