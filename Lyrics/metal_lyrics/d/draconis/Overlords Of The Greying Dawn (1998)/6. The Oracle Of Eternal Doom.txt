Demons fly overhead, their presence darkens the sky
Shadows fall upon the feeble human rave
Shadows of extinction that erase all light
and create devastation for all

Demons watch and laugh maniacally as they see christians burning
in hell that is now on earth
Burn for their ignorance of truth, they pray to their helpless God
who has been executed by our father Satan

The earth burning for eternity, christians writhing in agony
As their eternal doom begins the demon's pleasures fulfilled
As the followers of God die by their hands

The demons fly on to heaven and they crush the pearly gates
They slaughter the fleeing angels, triumphant are the ones of evil
No longer shall there be the weaklings of the light
And a new race shall be born into evil
