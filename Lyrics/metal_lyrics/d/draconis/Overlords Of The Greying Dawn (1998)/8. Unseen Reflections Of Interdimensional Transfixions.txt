Astral transfixions bring forth dimensional mindscapes
Spectral visions illuminate from the dark void
I descend to a subconscious netherworld, I drift among the ancestry of ancient ones
Staring through the dim-lit mirrors of unseen reality, I discover secrets of afterlife passage

Crossing through a barrier of interdimensional subconscious
Hymns of untold philosophies break the silence
Swallowed by internal visions of creation, I've become entranced by ruins of fantasies
Winds of obscurity levitate me over mountains of fire
I've entered a realm where i exist yet never have before

Crossing through a barrier of interdimensional subconscious
Hymns of untold philosophies break the silence
Swallowed by internal visions of creation, I've become entranced by ruins of fantasies
