From other worlds come the marching souls
Endlessly walking the path to infinity
Joining with them i see through eternity
I see the weakened mortals from above

Leaving the plane of earth and time
on a limitless voyage to nowhere
A silent power overwhelms the horde
of nomadic souls who wander

Lost in a void of immeasurable dimensions
I walk through the immortal gates of uncreation
Legions of darkness
now control the portal time

Now to walk the shadowed plane
where subconscious souls forever remain 
Hordes of evil from the blackened sun
discover a new path to immortality
