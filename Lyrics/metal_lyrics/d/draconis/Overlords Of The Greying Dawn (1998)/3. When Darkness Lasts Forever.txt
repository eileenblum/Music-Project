At the end of mankind's existence the light shall fade away
Creatures of Darkness come from the shadows
Blackened are their souls

Nocturnals dominate the realm
Succeeding in the quest of becoming he empowered
Reigning with the shadows as the night grows darker

Those the authors of all pain and sorrow yet who sorrow not
Shall dominate the earth in the dark age

When darkness lasts forever
