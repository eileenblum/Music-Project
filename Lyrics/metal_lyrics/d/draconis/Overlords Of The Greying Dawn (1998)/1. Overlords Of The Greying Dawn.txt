HAIL THE ARMY OF SATAN!

Onward we ride into eternal nightfall
Where evil shall rule and God is forgotten
Never again speak the name
of the one who is forsaken

Grey is the flag of hate the shade of endless warfare
The war against the light has now begun
Engulfed in a pit of flames are the bodies
of God's children

We destroy their image of an afterlife
and spit on their worthless ideas of heaven
We disgrace the name of their father
and eliminate their pitiful existence

The overlords of Satan's sacrificial
bloodlust ceremony shall torture, murder, and burn
the feeble followers of Christ

We destroy their image of an afterlife
and spit on their worthless ideas of heaven
We disgrace the name of their father
and eliminate their pitiful existence

Their symbol of weakness will never be seen again
As their buildings and crosses crumble to the ground
The earth will tremble under the chaos of the unholy
Overlords of the greying dawn
