Underneath the cloudy skies of grey
In the frozen times of winter
A dismal blanket of fog approaches
To shroud a mystic realm with gloom

A feeling of misery enwraps us
In a trance we depart
To a darker shade of consciousness
From where we are worlds apart

Sometimes the cold grey sky
warms the soul like fire
When the dawn no longer sheds
its blinding light of day

After the storm has lifted the darkness never fades
For a dismal winter day shall always shed its grey

Underneath the cloudy skies of grey
In the frozen times of winter
A dismal blanket of fog approaches
To shroud a mystic realm with gloom
