Fall to your knees, beg for forgiveness
I'll be the lord of your pain
and the one to deny your salvation

I am the crusher of hope
and the bringer of death
Possessing the power of infinite wrath

The ultimate evil is my anger within
pulsing and flowing with sin after sin
Dwelling in darkness upon demonic thrones

I await the profound sign
from our diabolical majesty
This world must be destroyed
The highest of all dark powers

I will soon become the sworn enemy of man
Whose worthless existence is underserving
of a painless demise
I will sacrifice myself just
to see billions burning in pain

The highest of all dark powers
I acknowledge the sign from our diabolical majesty
This world is burning in pain
