On the blackest eve of winter nights the shadows call my name
A dark path of possession descends to nocturnal realms

Departing from the sleeping world awake in a fantasy
Silent is the place in which I dwell
Where there is no place for life

Thrones of darkness guide my path
From far above I descend to nocturnal realms

Drifting through a timeless void the shadows fill my soul
Entering to an ancient realm where darkness lasts forever

On the blackest eve of winter nights the shadows fade away
Over mountains forgotten in time I shall forever be nocturnal
