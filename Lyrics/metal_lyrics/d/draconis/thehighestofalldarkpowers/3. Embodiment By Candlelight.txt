We are the children of fire the walkers of worlds
We are empowered by chaos eternally
The candlelight exposes a gate from beyond
Let us begin the ascension

Unite me with darkness
oh lord of infernal realms
Show me the paths to walk, to find the answers
to secrets unknown

Welding the fury of demons inside
I slowly gain strength through possession
I travel through dominions of supernatural creation
The power begins growing within
Embodiment by candlelight
