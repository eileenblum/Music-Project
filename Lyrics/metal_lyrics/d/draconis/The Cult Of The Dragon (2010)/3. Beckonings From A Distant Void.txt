[Lyrics: Pardi]

Closer and closer the spiral void comes
To bring your mind into madness
The blinding red and the piercing sounds
Tearing apart your subconscious

The maze set before you but nowhere to turn
As voices call you in from beyond
Twisted and evil powers unknown
Wrought with unrest and demonic intent

Archaic and ancient it beckons you
Creation of pain and infernal demise
No will to resist this consuming torture

Vortex of mental pain
As voices call you in from beyond
Confusion shall reign
You're wrought with unrest and demonic intent
