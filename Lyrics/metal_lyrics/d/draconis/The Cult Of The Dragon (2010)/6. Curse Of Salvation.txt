[Lyrics: Pardi/Miranda]

A soul not worth saving in the eyes of the weak
Stronger than all of their fake beliefs
Reality crushing the hypocrisy
An unmoving stone in the path of the meek

Curse of salvation
I will never be saved
GROVEL FOR ME BASTARD SON
My hate will never fade

Your words do not move me
Your "heaven" I defy
My laws are my own
Your resurrection I deny

I obstruct your path to righteousness
I won't speak his name
Always one step ahead of you
But in your eyes "left behind"
