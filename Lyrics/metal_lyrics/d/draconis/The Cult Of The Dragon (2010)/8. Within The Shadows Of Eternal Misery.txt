[Lyrics: Pardi]

A burning rage of immeasurable pain
Flows through my soul
Storms of darkness race through my mind
Visions of an ancient past encircle me
As I search for echoes of the future

Peace of mind will never be found
No one can appease my desires
So to my own self be true
AND TURN MY BACK TO HEAVEN

A thirst for vengeance is what keeps me alive
For I didn't choose this life
The pitiful ways of the human race
Have made me feel this contempt

Until my blood paints the ground
I will forever remain enwrapped
Within the shadows of eternal misery
