[Lyrics: Pardi/Miranda]

Sever your flesh
To bring you suffering
Torture you again and again
Your mind is lost
You are deformed beyond recognition
Searing heat
Cauterized wounds
The blood not yet spilled
Is soon to flow free

Screams of endless torment
In the end your worst dreams come true
The pain is gone and the memory fades
But it all starts over again

Beyond your death lies a realm of pain
Horror instilled as you depart from this world
A beast awaits to ravage you
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

Screams of endless torment
All shall turn a deaf ear
No one responds to your cries for help
Your body will be desecrated

Limbs are torn from your torso
Eyes gouged out, toes removed
Skin is melting and peeled away
You are reduced to a bloody stump

Screams of endless torment
In the end your worst dreams come true
The pain is gone and the memory fades
Bu it all starts over again

Screams of endless torment
All shall turn a deaf ear
No one responds to your cries for help
Your body will be desecrated

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?
He cannot help you
All hope is lost
As your existence fades into nothing
