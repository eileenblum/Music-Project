[Lyrics: Miranda]

Aggression takes over like a drug
Adrenaline rushing through
Intensity too strong to control
Fueling the need, exciting the greed

Violence, distorted reality
Seeing red, clouded judgment
Feeding off your fear
Intensity too strong to control
Fueling the need, exciting the greed

Bloodlust, rage
Feeling your life struggle in my grasp
This is your end
Broken, defeated
I WANT BLOODLUST, RAGE
Nothing less than crushing your skull
There is no end
Blinded, insane
I WANT MORE

AGGRESSION
VIOLENCE
INTENSITY
BLOODLUST
