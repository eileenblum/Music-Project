[Lyrics: Pardi/Miranda]

Authors of pain, breeders of sorrow
Driven by suffering
Eyes filled with rage
Echoes of madness

Curse thy name for eternity
Standing defiant with fists to the sky
Hope fails and dies
In life as in death

Trampled and broken the weak will of man
Existence is nothing... forgotten
Peace is no more as chaos ensues
The Cult of the Dragon

Black out the sky, light exists here no longer
Feel the dragon's breath as we scorch the earth

Any hope of a future
BURNT BEFORE YOUR EYES
Nothingness prevails
OUR REIGN IS SUPREME

Eliminate your weakness
Proclaim our greatness
Tormented and cast away
Bleak is thy fate
Showered in darkness for eternity
Even your memory is gone
