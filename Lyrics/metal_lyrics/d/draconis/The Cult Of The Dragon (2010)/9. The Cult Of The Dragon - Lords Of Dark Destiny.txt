[Lyrics: Pardi/Miranda]

We, the lords of your dark destiny
Transparent and swift
Forever compelled towards the crushing darkness
Solemn and strong

NO ONE IS INNOCENT
NO ONE IS SAFE
SIN UNRELENTING
SIN JUSTIFIED

Secrets revealed from the past
Once thought to be lost for all time
Set in stone now to never be undone
Thy will be crushed and doomed

Those with power kept it locked inside
THE BLACK HEARTED HORDE
Never to tell of its hidden capacity
THE CULT OF THE DRAGON

Law over faith
Strength over ritual
Time grows short for all who defy

Line-up:
Mike Pardi - Guitars, Vocals
Gary Miranda - Bass, Backing Vocals
Ariel Alvarado - Drums, Backing Vocals
