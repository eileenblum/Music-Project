Another old forgotten scene
Will show my better me
Another lie not filtered shows a hidden place
A sanctuary

Places, hidden breathing spaces
To face the music
Places, I mesmerize my traces
With chains around my soul

Will I ever find out how much more have I concealed
Will I ever have settled everything
Will I be free

Places, hidden breathing spaces
To face the music
Places, I mesmerize my traces
With chains around my soul

How much longer will I wait
A dangerous game but I canât stray away
I know this far too well
Iâve walked this road before

Places, hidden breathing spaces
To face the music
Places, I mesmerize my traces
With chains around my soul
