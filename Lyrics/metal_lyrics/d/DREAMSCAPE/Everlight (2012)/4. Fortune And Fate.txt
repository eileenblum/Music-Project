Somethingâs missing
He canât believe that
Nothing changes at allâ¦

Thereâs an image of
How the things could be
But it seems to be sealed

Still not finding
A pathway out
Of this labyrinth called mind

There is one thing he has to realize
Lifeâs got clues to go on

Millions of chances
Are crossing our way
Guiding us into the future

Throwing our glances
At fortune and fate
Trusting our senses
And seizing the chances within

Paying heed to the given signs
Now heâs changing it all

There are patterns and no coincidence
Now heâs ready to grow

Millions of chances
Are crossing our way
Guiding us into the future

Throwing our glances
At fortune and fate
Trusting our senses
And seizing the chances within
