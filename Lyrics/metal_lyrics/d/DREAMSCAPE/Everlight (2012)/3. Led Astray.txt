When you were a child
We were balanced deep inside
Waiting for the change that brings you home again

Time is on our side
Run and hide, I'm still your guide
Awaiting your salvation and return

Now I'm free
To break the mirror
Another lie
My goal's becoming clearer

You're all the same
So who are you to blame me
The look in my eyes
The power gleams inside

Closing up my heart
Shutting out that soul which still believes
In my grace

Bleed for, weep for my desire
Die for my endless greed
Fear me, still I fear you more
You're locked and kept away
I'm led astray

I still don't care
Another sweet temptation
The look in my eyes
The power gleams inside
Shutting out that soulâ¦

Bleed for, weep for my desire
Die for my endless greed
Fear me, still I fear you more
You're locked and kept away
I'm led astray
