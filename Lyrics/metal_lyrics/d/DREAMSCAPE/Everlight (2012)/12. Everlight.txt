When shall we turn to light
Rise from the darkness
Or our night â fallen world?
And leave the ones who brought misery
The rise of the wicked
The fall of all

When shall we turn to dust
And rise from its ashes
With trust in the cold
And will arise as the everlight
Sworn to our wishes
Shall live to give

Everlight
See the everlight
Reach out and rise again
Everlight
Feel the everlight
Hold on and trust again

The weary drive shall be overcome
A solid state into one by one
Rising from the deep
I cannot sleep

And in the dark we will understand
Not only know but comprehend
That grace and light is a miracle â recall!
Through which weâre reaching our pinnacle

Crossing two roads I see
The stars of my destiny

Everlight
See the everlight
Reach out and rise again
Everlight
Feel the everlight
Hold on and trust again

Crossing two roads I see
Crossing two roads I see

Everlight
See the everlight
Everlight
Feel the everlight
Everlight

When shall we turn to dust
And rise from its ashes
With trust in the cold

And will arise as the everlight
Sworn to our wishes
Shall live to give
