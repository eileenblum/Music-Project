Look past the darkness
Where do the ways collide?
Fragmented in silent silk
As I collect the truth to hide

Time and pressure create a dive
Make our life and death
In the desperate mind is where they strive
Every now and thenâ¦

Where do we go?
Restless thoughts stream again
Stranded alone
Restless species
All that we know
Restless dreams once again
World without home
Restless minds torn to pieces

A view from the distance
Longing to be understood
The challenge is hopeless now
If I can change it all, I shouldâ¦

In the desperate mind is where they strive
Every now and then

Where do we go?
Restless thoughts stream again
Stranded alone
Restless species
All that we know
Restless dreams once again
World without home
Restless minds torn to pieces

Why in the silence
Comes this endless stream of
Endless words
To silent to feel awake

Awake
To silent to feel awake
To silent to feel awake
To silent to feel awake

Where do we go?
Restless thoughts stream again
Stranded alone
Restless species
All that we know
Restless dreams once again
World without home
Restless minds torn to pieces
