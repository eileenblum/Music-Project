Moving on
Faces in the distance
Change will come
Hear it whisper

Waiting for the gifts
Healing your defenses
Study onâ¦
And catch the wisdom

More than light
More than sight
Cause weâre the violet flame forever
Filled with freedom, bliss and hope for more

Moving on
Try to remember
Who you are and
Why youâre here

Leaving older habits
Friends will realize
And will be asking
For advice

More than light
More than sight
Cause weâre the violet flame forever
Blistering with hope that we are

More than light
More than sight
Cause weâre the violet flame forever
Filled with freedom, bliss and hope for more

âThere is a lighter way
To reach your dreams
And find again that thereâs no sight
Light has no majesty
You hold it in your hands
Now start to live your lifeâ

Now you made the choice
To follow your belief
It is a timeless deed
You notice your inner voice

More than light
More than sight
Cause weâre the violet flame forever
Blistering with hope that we are

More than light
More than sight
Cause weâre the violet flame forever
Filled with freedom, bliss and hope for more

You are the violet flame
Always try to find the way to
Your higher self
