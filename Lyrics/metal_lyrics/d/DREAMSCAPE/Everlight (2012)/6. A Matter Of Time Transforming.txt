Make my day and set me free
Free from all the empathy
Learn to live and learn to win
Seek the challenge and begin from within and

When the conscienceâs overcome
Careless of the other ones
Learn to live and learn to prey
Victories will make my day, make my day

To rise above the others

Got no fear, I count on me
Live off my own theory
Ignorance and rageâs my drive
Confidence will make my day, make my day

Try to discover
Where this all will lead
Try to pretend Iâm on my own

What is mine?
What is honest?
Will I really be the next in line?

What has been a lie before
And I used to ignore
Now Iâm ready to requestion it

What is lifeâs last reward
What is worth living for?

All that I have ever expected
All that I have ever desired
Wealth and wisdom, courage and beauty
Youth and brightness, tranquillity

Change is insecure, change is all unsure

There are always some pieces missing
There is always more to achieve
Power, strength and constant reliance
Happiness and richness with joy

How to reach the goal
And to keep them all
I prepared my fall

And I have tried
To pray to angels
And every time I looked
For change within

But there was that useless answer
For my discontented self:

âYou cannot enforce it
But when the time is right
The change will come and suddenly
You let go and embrace your human flaws
And receive unfolding giftsâ

Disappointment brings new drive
Old ambitions still alive
Keep on living for the win
Seek the challenge and begin from within, still

Rush about with company
Run away from memory,
Still I live and still I prey
Victories will make my day, make my day

Try to discover
Where this all will lead
Try to pretend Iâm on my own

This is what I have become
To hate and recklessness I have succumb
This is how the conscienceâs overcome
My trail has just begun

A strange disaster closed the door
Something reached me I was told before
Here at last thereâs just a dead-end waiting
I feel transformed inside

A violet flame forever
Has touched my inner self-insight
I can let go, embrace my flaw
And now receive my gifts

A violet flame forever
Has touched my inner self-insight
I will let go, embrace my flaw
And now receive unfolding gifts

And I realized my faults
And I have embraced all my flaws
That have held me down
But now I have grown
A self-insight

A matter of time transforming
