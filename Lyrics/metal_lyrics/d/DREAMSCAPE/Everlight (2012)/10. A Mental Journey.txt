Claim your thoughts
Raise your voice
Place it into
Shining dreams of way above
Rising higher, way above

You may turn â away today
But tomorrow still awaitsâ¦

Skyward high
Your winged words fly
Healing and revealing
Steadily

Dare to dream and set them free
All that was will ever be in me

I will not subside
In a pattern thoughts still hide
I may not resist the masked
And indulging beast

As it seemed before
Can explain it more and more
How it creeps into your back
And reveals the blackâ¦

Trying to understand the great divine
Making this whole journey mine
Reaching to far horizons, reaching me
And Iâm beginning to be

Our life will not replay
Our life takes us away
And may leave us to stray

Silent trace
Faithful grace
Restless days and
All that it takes!

Trying to understand the great divine
Making this whole journey mine
Reaching to far horizons, reaching me
And Iâm beginning to be

Our life will not replay
Our life takes us away
Our life â a mental journey
My life is all thatâs meant for me

The traces before meâ¦
Itâs why Iâm here
