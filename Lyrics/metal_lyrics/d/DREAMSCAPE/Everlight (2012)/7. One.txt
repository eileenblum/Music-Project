As now our time seemed over
And all our waiting ends
Weâre reaching out with steady
And embracing hands

The sleepless dawn awakens
Our precious sun inside
The wide and wondrous gazes
A state of grace and light

Dance and spin
You may win
Thatâs how we reach the state where
All is one againâ¦ constantly

The fires were left for starving
Abandoned in despair
But now an ember started
What once was unaware

Dance and spin
You may win
Thatâs how we reach the state where
All is one againâ¦ constantly

Dance and spin on your way
Dance and spin on your way
You try to catch the moment
To believe

Dance and sing
Be your own king
Thatâs how we reach the state where
All is one againâ¦ constantly
