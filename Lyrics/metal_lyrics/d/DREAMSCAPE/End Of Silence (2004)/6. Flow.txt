You and I - distinct, but such alike...
You and I - frontiers we cannot hide...
When did we leave the common path we used to share?
How could we ever forget all once we took care?

Watch the instant passes by
Just before you realize
What we've learned to love
Is going to be compromised.

There's nothing to eternalise
And nothing to remain.
An unaffected habit
Turns into another blame.

No one can stop the killing machine
That keeps us somehow alive.
Centuries are gone, time marches on -
Among them we keep up to flow...

We're falling into never land
And losing our confidence
In what we used to believe.
Missing sympathy?
Weakling harmony?
Now it's time to face a new outset...

Once we did not understand
To hold on their traditions.
Time has faced us to play this role -
The following position!

No one can stop the killing machine
That keeps us somehow alive.
Centuries are gone, time marches on -
Among them we keep up to flow...

But it feels like losing a friend,
Like to betray myself.
Now I wish to turn back time
And wake up in my dreams I can't forget...

Ca I still ignore, can I still be sure
Of what I am still holding on.
What is deep inside, to explain so tight,
I will never feel again...

Still nothing to eternalise,
But so much to remain.
Keep an eye on and realize
They only tried the same...

No one can stop the killing machine
That keeps us somehow alive.
Centuries are gone, time marches on -
Among them we keep up to flow...
Now I flow...
