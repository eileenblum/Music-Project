Another day's calling
The persistance of flow
Took its place in his mind long ago
The next day will be the last again
Covering his lonely way - tell me since when...?

His "friends" call him "freak"
Behind his back they speak
About his strange behavior and his "feat"...
In his world there is no place for a change,
No escape, just one way back to itself...

Stay just where you are!
Don't leave your wonted way!
It's all you know and ever had...
Trust in the machine
Running deep in your head
And guiding you - you cannot brake...

And he still believes doing the right thing.
Here's to him! There's a price he cannot win...

Easy to condemn what we don't understand
A land so far away to comprehend.
Searching for a value, unable to accept
We are not the ones who made this concept...
Just a kind of open mind...
Eye to eye hold on and try...!

Tasting his live...
Try to survive...
Do you think you're right...?!

Another day alone
At a crowded place-
He's staring at the mirror in his face.
It's not about that he ignores his life.
He's unable to comprehend he's still alive!

Stay just where you are!
Don't leave your wonted way!
It's all you know and ever had...
Trust in the machine
Running deep in your head
And guiding you - you cannot brake...

And he still believes doing the right thing.
Here's to him! There's a price he cannot win...

Stay just where you are!
Don't leave your wonted way!
It's all you know and ever had...
Trust in the machine
Running deep in your head
And guiding you - you cannot brake...
