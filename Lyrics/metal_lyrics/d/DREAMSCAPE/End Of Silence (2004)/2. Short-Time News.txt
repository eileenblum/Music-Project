Hear the latest news spread over the land.
Somehow we realized it much too late to follow the command.
Time's standing still, feeling the chill - nothing will be the same.
All will change - we replace our home with the remains.

Guided by the voice that keeps us under control
Suddenly we've been pushed from our life into an endless fall.
Could not prevent... where is the end? Suffering the masses at all...
And tomorrow we can't bear that in mind, we can't recall...

Not enough to fool yourself - just try to keep in mind!
It's not the answer if you leave it all behind...
Day by day we just forget what we heeded yesterday!
On and on we leave ourselves and fade away.

Turn yourself inside out and look what you will find
In between the broken clouds.
Can you see you are not the only one...
Close your eyes... time to say goodbye...

Not enough to fool yourself - just try to keep in mind!
It's not the answer if you leave it all behind...
Day by day we just forget what we heeded yesterday!
On and on we leave ourselves and fade away.
Day by day we just forget what we heeded yesterday!
On and on we leave ourselves and fade away.
