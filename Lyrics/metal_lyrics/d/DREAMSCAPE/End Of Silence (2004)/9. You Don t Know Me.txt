On and on I can hear them call
To comply all the dreams they've never met.
Obviously they don't care at all
I can't retract a life that they've never had...
My life belongs to me!
So open up your eyes to see...

I'm fed up with to meet your expectations
And I pay no attention to your ideals.
Don't try to grasp
'cause you don't know me!

I don't believe you can realize
Or understand I have my own needs at last.
It's overdue to day good-bye to your lies!
This is my way! It doesn't lead to your past!
Don't tell me what is right!
Don't tell me what I have to do!

[2x]
I'm fed up with to meet your expectations
And I pay no attention to your ideals.
Don't try to grasp
'cause you don't know me!

All I want is that you promise
To respect this is my own life!
It's time to let me go...

One day we look back and realize
That our minds did not diverge too much.
One day I understand that's the prize.
That is the main point always to keep in touch...

I can fly if I want!
I can head for the sun!
I can reach for all the stars out there!
I can live on my own!
I can find my home!
I can do just anything...

[2x]
I'm fed up with to meet your expectations
And I pay no attention to your ideals.
Don't try to grasp
'cause you don't know me!
