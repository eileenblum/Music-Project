Can you find yourself and tell me what you feel?
Can you justify all you've done for me...

Try another step
Trust in what you felt forever.
Leave the past behind again,,,
Swimming in the stream of time...

[2x]
Don't you see, there's so much more
We cannot hear and cannot see,
More than we can comprehend...

Where do we belong?
Where are we going to?
What else can we find if we ever try?

Somehow we understand,
We can not turn away
Even though we try to ignore the truth...

There's more than we can hear...
There's more than we can see...
There's more than we can comprehend for now...

You say you know...
I guess I believe in something you don't understand.
Sometimes we try
To find another reason why...
Wading through the Promised Land...

[2x]
Don't you see, there's so much more
We cannot hear and cannot see,
More than we can comprehend...

Where do we belong?
Where are we going to?
What can we find if we try?

More than we can hear...
More than we can see...
More than we can comprehend...
