All my thoughts are spinning just around:
I think of every time I am.
Getting close and losing you again -
Sometimes so near, too far away the next day...

Is this all about and all I care for...?
This I want you to know...

All I ever wanted, all I need
I can find anywhere in you.
All I ever trusted in, all I need
Is getting close to heaven
Every time I can be with you...

Just to feel to be in love with you
Is worth the game every day I play.
Every time I'm sharing with you...
...don't say goodbye before we try...

Tell me is this all about and all I care for...?
This I want you to know...

All I ever wanted, all I need
I can find anywhere in you.
All I ever trusted in and all I really need...

All I ever wanted, all I need
I can find anywhere in you.
All I ever trusted in, all I need
Is getting close to heaven
Every time with you...

All I ever wanted, all I need
Is getting close to heaven
Every time with you...
I can never let you know...
