All we can see
All we can list to
Just like a weird dream we can't escape...

I think we are too much afraid of
To realize it's not too late
Even if the path we have to go is full of pain.

Recall your memories
Through space and time
All you need is trust
To hit the road and leave the past behind
Watch out for your faith
Waits to be found
All you seem to know
Is based on an infected ground

It's so easy to believe what we have learned,
Educated and bequeathed - the seed that we will earn.
Feel the heartbeat, watch yourself, close your eyes to see -
Building up a bridge of hope between you and me.
We breath the same air and feel the same sun.
Mother Earth is what we share and where we're coming home!

Touch the ground to find the basics we have lost.
We have wasted too much time to fill our hearts with frost.
Living the madness we take it for real.
One step back to realize it's somewhere in your hand...

...to change anything you want...
...to stand up and face them all...
...to understand...

Everyone is too afraid to leave behind
In what we trust, to find something new
We've never been before outside of our dreams...
What if we find a place beneath the infected ground?
What if it's surrounded us forever...?
