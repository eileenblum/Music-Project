Darkness comes tonight, blinding your mind.
Day by day you try to find a way home again...

You are so alone. You never stay
Wading through nightmare you never leave -
They tell you the sense of life!

Searching for the gate - try to escape.
A silent cry - no one can hear you now
Imprisoned in your world of lies!

Turn out your mind,
Hold on and stay,
Just keep in mind you are never alone.
Turn out your mind,
Don't be afraid
There could be something leading you home...

[2x]
Tonight we will turn around and we'll leave your silent maze.
Tonight you will understand that it's time to find another place.
Just take my hands, you can learn to live,
And you feel like you're coming home...

There is something more...
So near and far away...
With open eyes, but blind...

Where do you belong?
In what do you believe?
Who do you think you are?
As long as you don't free your mind
You'll be enslaved inside your silent maze

[2x]
Tonight we will turn around and we'll leave your silent maze.
Tonight you will understand that it's time to find another place.
Just take my hands, you can learn to live,
And you feel like you're coming home...
