Don't ignore your feelings,
All you believed in
Don't wait for answers
No one can tell
Sometimes it seems
To be just a game
To loose or to win
Can be the same...

Somebody told the truth
Somebody told you lies
And in the end of all
You hear a voice inside...

Hiding in strange places
You've never known,
Wading in these mazes
Built by your own
Even disappointed,
Fallen and lonely,
There is someone out there â
Maybe that's me...

Somebody told the truth
Somebody told you lies
And in the end of all
You hear a voice inside...

Somebody needs you!
Somebody still believes in you!
Somebody loves you!
Somebody's waiting here for you!

Don't ignore your feelings,
All you believed in
Don't wait for answers
No one can tell
Sometimes it seems
To be just a game
To loose or to win
Can be the same...

Somebody told the truth
Somebody told you lies
And in the end of all
You hear a voice inside...

You'll never be alone again
Wherever you are I am...

Somebody needs you!
Somebody still believes in you!
Somebody loves you!
Somebody's waiting here for you!
