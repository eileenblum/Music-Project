From the wasteland
To the distant promised paradise
Time was slipping through my hands
I believed to see the difference
Of truth and lies
When I am faced to myself again

Running in endless circles
Surrounding myself...

Try to escape this nightmare
Try to arrive at nowhere...

I've seen this before!
But I can't take any more!
Don't you see it too?
I feel it again.
I don't know from where or when..
...Another deja vu

Time passes and I supposed to find something new
To leave the past at last behind
New faces pretend to feel so secure
TÐ¾ pull the rug from under me

Running in endless circles
Surrounding myself...

Try to escape this nightmare
Try to arrive at nowhere...

I've seen this before!
But I can't take any more!
Don't you see it too?
I feel it again.
I don't know from where or when..
...Another deja vu

I've seen this before!
But I can't take any more!
Don't you see it too?
I feel it again.
I don't know from where or when..
...Another deja vu
