The more things have changed
All will stay the same...
It's not getting easier...
Right now I just realize
It's hard to try
Right now this is my greatest fault:
I don't know why!

The more folks I meet
I know that for sure:
No one is safe from the same mistakes!

I am not alone
When dealing with the pain...
It's nothing but coming home

Through different eyes we see!
Different things are not unreal!
As it seems to me.
This doesn't have to be the way you feel...
Through different eyes we see!
Different things are not unreal!
It doesn't have to be your way...

Even if I will suffer
And I feel it still hurts
It's getting much more confided
Closer to even worse?

What if I try to do
Something no one did expect?
Another pain I could find
Is that what I am afraid?

Straight on my ordinary way
Another piece of me may die!

I can't feel what you gave me
I can't hear what you told me
I can't remember
What I was looking for
And did not find
But I can see now
I was wasting too much time...

... To try to believe you are the one
Loosing the sense of what is real
No one to blame.
Not me or you!
Just another different point of view!

Even if I vary...
Just slowly...
Not as everyone could realize...
And no one really does...
All is changing,
All is shifting.
We'll not be the same...
Believe me...
As I believe in you...
Today

Through different eyes we see!
Different things are not unreal!
As it seems to me.
This doesn't have to be the way you feel...
Through different eyes we see!
Different things are not unreal!
It doesn't have to be your way...

Even if I will suffer
And I feel it still hurts
It's getting much more confided
Closer to even worse?
What if I try to do
Something no one did expect?
Another pain I could find
Is that what I am afraid?
