I don't know how you
Became a part of me
And of my mind
Why I could not stop
To think of you
The way you look
At and smile to me...
I am not the one whom you assume
Maybe someone you always
Tried to find
But I still pretend
To be a friend
And the mask I wear
Is much too thin

Much too scared to tell the truth
Afraid that you could run away...

So why am I chasing time?
Can't go...
How can I escape?
Still try to leave the past behind
Point zero â and I cannot brake!

Reached the end
Of a one-way street
I have drifted too far and deep

Much too scared to tell the truth
Afraid that you could run away...

So why am I chasing time?
Can't go...
How can I escape?
Still try to leave the past behind
Point zero â and I cannot brake!

Clutching at straws
Believing hope dies last
I really tried to find
Another way back to home
Even if hope has gone at last.
Unable to scrap it:
These pictures in my head
All these memories inside,
These empty lonely thoughts!

Then I hold on
I'm breathing in and out
Silence fills me
To push away the pain

No more scared to tell the truth
Cause you would never run away...

So what?
No more chasing time!
Let go...
At last I did escape!
I did leave the past behind
Point zero
A new beginning...
