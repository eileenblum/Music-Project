Slowly the lights go down
And darkness fills the room
Standing here on my own
Much too soon

Some remaining voices
Still echo in my head
Sorry for all the choices we had

Time goes by,
And pain will fade away
One day,
But memories will stay...

Now remember all the times
Remember all the places.
Remember all that we've done for ourselves
Time to let you go, time to start from new
Time to leave you behind, to say farewell...

I don't regret a word
I don't forget your smile
Maybe we lose ourselves
For a while

Too many unknown reasons
Some issues â no replay
Wading through my 5th season
Tell me why?

Time goes by,
And pain will fade away
One day,
But memories will stay...

Now remember all the times
Remember all the places.
Remember all that we've done for ourselves
Time to let you go, time to start from new
Time to leave you behind, to say farewell...
