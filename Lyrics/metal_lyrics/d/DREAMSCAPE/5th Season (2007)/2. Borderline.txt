Look at you and me,
We had our time, don't disagree
Maybe we believed
In things we never can achieve

Nevertheless we came this far
Am I awake or do I dream?
We haven't moved far away from the start
The more it seems...

We're losing the sense of what is real
Across the borderline
We're leaving the past and all our fears
Behind the borderline

I tried to lose the pain
As we know this can't go on again
We have gone so far
But we even don't know who we are...

I've reached the point beside myself
I cannot hide. Why can't you see?
Don't you know there's no one else?
Some things will never be...

We're losing the sense of what is real
Across the borderline
We're leaving the past and all our fears
Behind the borderline

I'm losing the sense of what is real
when I cross the borderline...

I've reached the point beside myself
I cannot hide. Why can't you see?
Don't you know there's no one else?
Some things will never be...

We're losing the sense of what is real
Across the borderline
We're leaving the past and all our fears
Behind the borderline

Some thing's happened
Some thing's gone
Somehow we keep going on...
