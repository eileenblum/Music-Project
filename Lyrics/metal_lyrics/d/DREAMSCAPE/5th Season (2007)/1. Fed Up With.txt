How long do you mess me about
Believe if there is no doubt
I keep strong as long as you do not refuse
There's nothing left of me to be abused

What if my mind is staying blind?

You thought you can bring me down
Be sure i just trust my own
Don't think you can cover
All your masquerade
So easy to unhide the truth inside

And my eyes start to leave the dark
I 'm catching sight-
They were turned away by my heart...

But I, I'm so fed up with all of you!
I cannot see what's wrong, what's true
And I, I'm so fed up with my own!
So leave me alone!

Try understanding what I've done to you
Some one out there who feels like me, too?
Loosing the feeling who to believe...
A disappointment much too deep...

I know this time
It will not be the last time
Some things change
The other things will stay
We'll keep silent and we're staying dazed
Afraid to leave the maze...

But my eyes start to leave the dark

And my eyes start to leave the dark
I 'm catching sight-
They were turned away by my heart...

But now I'm so fed up with all of you!
I cannot see what's wrong, what's true
Now I'm so fed up with my own!
So leave me alone
