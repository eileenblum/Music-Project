Opposed to the world
It also exists in us
He's waiting to be set free
Close to the things he is sure
And certainly he takes them
As given and real
Afraid to look under
The surface he knows

Closing his eyes he's starting tÐ¾
Dive into the sea of trust
Faced to the unexpected
His confidence tells him
That this time it lasts...

... Forever
... And pieces float together
Combined to something new
He awakes...

Still confused
What happened to him so easily
He keeps smiling â
Received a present to set him free...
What belongs together
Will find each other another day

Now he feels what it means at all
Let his senses fall into
Something so beautiful
Too unreal too far away to believe...
Now he feels what it means
And he keeps his senses fall into
Something so beautiful
Too unreal too far away to believe...

Scared and confused
They feel like abused
And don't know it's something
They don't understand, they ease their mind
And they refuse its real...
Start to forget without great regret
They don't know
It's something they don't comprehend
A chance to believe in a miracle

Opening his eyes he's starting to
Dive into the sea of trust
And faced to the unexpected
His confidence keeps him going on at last

Now he feels what it means at all
Let his senses fall into
Something so beautiful
Too unreal too far away to believe...
Now he feels what it means
And he keeps his senses fall into
Something so beautiful
Too unreal too far away to believe...
