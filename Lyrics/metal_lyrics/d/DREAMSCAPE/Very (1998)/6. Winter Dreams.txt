Winter dreams - silver shining
Shattered scenes - endless night
Winter brings changes
Life turns into illusion
I have to face the loss
Snow's falling down on me
Endless alone
I'm waiting for the summer
Cold winds are calling me
I want to live again
Watching the crystal star tonight
Feeling the sorrow in disguise
Afraid to speak - I'm fading inside
I know it's freezing me
When I'm dreaming
There's tomorrow in my heart
When I dream of you
I long for your touch
Nothing melts a fozen heart
Dreamin' longing for a touch of you
I'm bleeding
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm prayin' for a sign
