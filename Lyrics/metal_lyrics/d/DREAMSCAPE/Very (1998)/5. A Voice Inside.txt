Wake up in the morning
I hear a voice inside
What I've seen and what I've felt
Memories inside my head
Don't try to understand
Just try to raise my head
raise my head
A voice KILLING inside
Reflections of my mind
A chance is gone
To catch my broken dream
Consuming all my pride
The price is not all right
Darkness arrives and teadrops on my pillow
Starngers inside - silent they cry
A voice CRYING inside
The night I feel the pouring rain
Could wash my sorrow and my pain
You know I'm stranded in a wasteland
Flames burning in the center of my soul
And the sands of time are rustling in my face
I feel the rush standing on the edge
Soon breaks another day
But I'm sentenced
Sentenced
A voice SPEAKING inside
