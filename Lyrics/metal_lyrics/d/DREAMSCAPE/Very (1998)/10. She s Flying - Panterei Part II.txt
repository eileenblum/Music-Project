Helpless child
Leaving all behind
Keeps her eye on the horizon
She's flying
Morning comes again
To wash away her pain
Straight into the night
On velvet wings she's flying
Into the clouds
She's crying
When the morning comes
She's flying
A lonely child again
Glitter of her eyes
The love she felt inside
Temptation turns to fate
On velvet wings she's flying
Into the dust
She's crying
When morning comes
She's flying
Seven years She's crying
The stars seem out of reach
While you were about to look behind
Your mind was LEADING to a choice
You're crying for a voice inside
Leave it all behind
Leaving not just waterfalls
water water waterfalls
Crying
The stars seem out of reach
While you were about to look behind
Your mind was SCULPTURING a choice
You're crying for a voice inside
