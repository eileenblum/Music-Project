I remember my dream
"Face your fears" they haunted me
This time I let it rain
Still pictures in that game
All alone
I can see the door
I received a second chance
I pluck my courage: "Am I reborn?"
This time I feel the rain
Still pictures in that game
On my own
I open the door
Night's coming on
I know my dreams is coming true
A kiss of the water
Leaves a mark on the sand
I close my eyes - I'm listening to
This friendly tempting call
I'm reborn
I'm living
I face it
Fears are gone 
This time I let it rain
Still pictures in that game
With tears in my eyes
I'm touching the ground
The morning sun shines on me
And nothing matters
On my own
I open the door
Night's coming on
I know my dreams is coming true
A kiss of the water
Leaves a mark on the sand
I close my eyes - I'm listening to
This friendly tempting call
I'm reborn
I'm dying
