Life lies dry
Once innocent
I'm spinning in the space
I take a long trip far away
Drifting in timeless haze
So many times
I felt so alone
Never at home
I stay back in yesterday
Yesterday left scars on me
I've seen it all before
There was a time
I cursed myself
Now future I adore
So many times
I felt so alone
I was looking for me
I see from a different side
I've been told
Believe in time
I've changed my mind
Into my distant eyes
I left behind
Left inside
It's time to say goodbye
I'm waiting for new order
I'm waiting for a sign
Nothing can take my past away
One side
So many times
I felt so alone
I was looking for me
I see from a different side
I've been told
Believe in time
I've changed my mind
Into my distant eyes
I left behind
Left inside
It's time to say goodbye
I'm waiting for new order
I'm waiting for a sign
I leave my past behind
I left behind
