Years have past
Waters ran softly
The sea is calm tonight
The tide was full
Sweet is the nightair
On broken wings you can't fly
Seven years
We both were parted
Once an innocent mind
In delay there lies no plenty
Years have past
Waters ran softly
The sea is calm tonight
The tide was full
Sweet is the nightair
On broken wings you can't fly
A gentle spirit flows around me
When I went on to ease pain
Eternal note of crimson sadness
And morning breaks in summer's rain
Sorrow to sorrow as you flied upward
Turning around like wave
Sorrow to sorrow she trailed in the dust
Counting the steps of the sun
The drew of morning
On sinking fire
This starry rise and fall
The land of dreams in children's eyes
Is tumbling down into the thorns of life
Time went on
Transcending the unknown
Once an innocent mind
Falling in the abyss of heaven
Phoenix helpless child
Years have past
Waters ran softly
The sea is calm tonight
The tide was full
Sweet is the nightair
Out in the tranquil bay
