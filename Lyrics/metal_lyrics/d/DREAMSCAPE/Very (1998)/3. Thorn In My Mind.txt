Wonder why I'm here
Losing faith in who I am
Evidence surrounding me
My world has gone today
Still alive
I look through my mind
Red pictures express my fantasy
I realize
The thorn in my mind
Have lost all my pride
In this senseless game
Passionless age among
Break down the wall
The day brings no light
Looking up to grey sky
So help me my friend
To chase away my memory
Still alive
I look through my mind
Red pictures express my broken dreams
I realize
The thorn in my mind
Have lost all my pride
In this senseless game
Passionless age among
Break down the wall
Passionless age among
Break down the wall
THORN IN MY MIND
THORN IN MY MIND
THORN IN MY MIND
THORN IN MY MIND Still alive
I look through my mind
Red pictures express my broken dreams
I realize
The thorn in my mind
Have lost all my pride
In this senseless game
Passionless age among
Break down the wall
Passionless age among
Break down the wall
THORN IN MY MIND
THORN IN MY MIND
THORN IN MY MIND
THORN IN MY MIND
