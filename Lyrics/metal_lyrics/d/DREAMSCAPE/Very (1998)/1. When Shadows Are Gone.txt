Ancient time - as darkness surrounds the world
Nothing's going on
Total coldness in the heart of men
No emotions just performance
Time has come to charge everything
There's a sign in the night
A spark from within
Out of the ashes into the light
The end of the pressure begun
Winds of revenge
A voice from within
When shadows are gone
somewhere deep inside
Men fearing the blade and the fire
With tears in their eyes
They turn to the gods
Oh- into holy land
When shadows are gone
Out of control
Through the oceans
They drift away-
When shadows are gone
There's a sign in the night
A spark from within
Out of the ashes into the light
The end of the pressure begun
Winds of revenge
A voice from within
When shadows are gone
somewhere deep inside
Men fearing the blade and the fire
With tears in their eyes
They turn to the gods
Oh- into holy land
When shadows are gone
