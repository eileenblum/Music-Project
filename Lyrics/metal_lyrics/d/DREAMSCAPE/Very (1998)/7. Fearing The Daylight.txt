Now his dreams are over
And reality surrounds
Kain's heart
He must learn to be a
Nightmare creature
Far from life
He beginsa to search
For guilty ones
And time is running
Kain can't see with traitor's eyes
Wrong ways
Can't bring back his past
True dreams and friends
Finally
No remembrance of humanity
Old scratch is burning
Inside his fury mind
Raving rage
Signs have changed
Halycon days are gone
Running through a grey cold night
Listening to one silent moon
Fearing the daylight
Smashing dreams and breaking souls
Hiding in a small black box
Fearing the daylight
With the last hard showdown
He begins to understand
To dream
Is impossible
For him in hell
God only believes
In creature's life
That have an end
