Like the times before
She takes her box of dreams
A thousand times before
Darkness fills her head

Stretches her arms to tough
The endless sky
Watches clouds roll by
Searches for fields of joy

Moon hides the sun today
Dried up desert heart
Red roses falling to the ground
Find rainbow's end
Coldness of the stars
Silent cries

Loneliness
Fills her mind
Life in slow motion
Tear-stained eyes
Frozen dreams
Withered fields

Falling leaves
Empty trees
Run off into the distance
Autumn cold breeze
Raging seas
Start to freeze

Moon hides the sun today

Run off into the distance
Autumn cold breeze
Raging seas
