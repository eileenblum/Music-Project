OUT OF MY MIND
SO FAR AWAY
THERE IS THE SIGN OF THORN

LEARN FROM THE ANSWER
NEVER SURRENDER
CLEANSE OUT YOUR TARNISHED HEART

IT'S TIME TO FORGET NOW
IT'S TIME TO FORGET ALL YOUR PREACHERS
IT'S TIME TO FORGET NOW
YOU'VE GOT TO EASY YOUR MIND

IT'S TIME TO FORGET NOW
IT'S TIME TO FORGET ALL YOUR LEADERS
YOU'VE GOT TO LET LOVE LEAD
MY FRIEND, IT'S EASIERTO BELIEVE IN

FROM FAR AWAY, YOU HEAR
THE SCREAMS OF THE EAGLE
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW
SO DON'T TURN YOUR HEAD

SPIRITS OF THE DARK-WILL YOU
LOOSEN YOUR EMBRACE-HELP ME TO SEE
SPIRITS OF THE DARK-WON'T YOU
COVER ME AGAIN-I WON'T BOW BEFORE YOU

SPIRITS OF THE DARK-WILL YOU LET ME GO?
SILENCE EVERYWHERE-CAN I EVER PUT TRUST IN YOU?

ALL MY FRIENDS-JUST BELIEVE IN ME AGAIN

SPIRITS OF THE DARK-WILL YOU LET ME BE
SILENCE EVERYWHERE-AND THE DAY IS BECOMING DARK
NOW IT'S DARK
THERE'S A SINGLE FLAME-THE LAST
