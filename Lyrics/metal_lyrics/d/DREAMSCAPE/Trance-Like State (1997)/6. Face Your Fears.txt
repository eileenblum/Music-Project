He's pale with fear
This little boy
Cause night is coming on
This child's room will
Turn into a grave
To sacrifice his brain

His tiredness conquered him at last
So now he's fast asleep
Through all his dreams
He's waiting for
A sign of the deadly beast

He's sitting in the middle of
A hall with one red door
And listening to an unknown voice
With a friendly tempting call

Now face your fears
You must open the door
Come to the other side
Pluck up courage and face your fears

He has been cursed
Since he was young
This nightmare pesters him
So, as a man
It's still the same
He fears the same old dream

In all the years he never tried
To open the red door
Every night a senseless fight
The terror continues

He's sitting in the middle of
A hall with one red door
And listening to an unknown voice
With a friendly tempting call

Now face your fears
You must open the door
Come to the other side
Pluck up courage and face your fears

Then after an empty life
Old man's lying in his bed to die
The voice entreats him for the last time
And a doomed man has no more fear
He's opening the red door and then
The sun breaks through the clouds of pain
You better face your fears
