[Kerinnis/Kerinnis]

SHIVERING WITH COLDNESS
SHE'S CROUCHING BEHIND A CRATE
WAITING FOR NIGHTFALL AND SO OBSESSED WITH HATE

SEE THE SHADOWS IN HER HEART
WHAT HAS SHE DONE
SHE'S ADDICTED TO SWEET FANTASIES
I SEE IT IN HER PUNISHED FACE

FATEFULL RUN

SHE'S LEAVING HER HIDING PLACE
BAREFOOT IN THE STREETS
SEARCHING FOR THE RELEASE
HUNGRY FOR THE NEXT DREAM

FALLING ANGEL WHO SEDUCED
HER IN THE PAST
LIGHT AND SHADOW TURNED TO GREY FOR HER
I SEE IT IN HER PUNISHED FACE

FATEFULL RUN

SHE IS LIVING IN A DREAM
THIS DREAM WOULD MAKE ME SCREAM
BUT SHE IS DEPENDENT
IT IS HER SOUL SUPPORT HER MIND
FROZEN TEARDROPS IN THE SUN
THE MERCILESS TIME RUNS AND AT THIS HOUR
IT SEEMS THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
SHE'S ON THE HIGHWAY TO THE

FATEFULL SILENCE, FATEFULL SILENCE

SEE THE SHADOWS IN HER HEART
WHAT HAS SHE DONE
SHE'S ADDICTED TO SWEET FANTASIES
I SEE IT IN HER PUNISHED FACE

FATEFULL RUN
[Repeat Four Times]
