Take these devilish tones to your heart
These words, written in the anxiety of devotion
Let your soul be filled by the pain and the misery
Suck every feeling to your soul and die inwards

Forget every thought about happiness
Because you will never find it
And you shall never find it
Annihilate every joyfull thought in eternity

Now realize that this is real
Realize that you won't get away
Your soul shall be His forever
And you shall serve Him

Lay yourself down with a knife in your hand
Let it caress your skin, then open your flesh
Then, let Him in
The horned beast
Let Him occupy the completness of you

Now feel, fear and terror as He enters your veins
As He injects the poison, that shall stay in your veins forever
He shall control your soul forever, and there will be no way back
And all of your actions shall be His and for Him
Fuck everything and rape, assault and murder for Him

LÃ¤gg dig ned med kniven I din hand
LÃ¥t den smeka din hud och Ã¶ppna ditt kÃ¶tt
SlÃ¤pp sedan in honom, den behornade herren
LÃ¥t honom ockupera hela dig

KÃ¤nn nu, rÃ¤dslan och terrorn nÃ¤r han entrar dina vener
NÃ¤r han injecerar giftet
Som skall stanna I dina Ã¥dror fÃ¶r evigt
Han skall kontrollera din sjÃ¤l fÃ¶r evigt,
Och det finns ingen Ã¥tervÃ¤ndo
Och alla dina handlingar skall vara Ã¥t honom och fÃ¶r honom
FÃ¶rsumma allt och vÃ¥ldta, misshandla och mÃ¶rda fÃ¶r honom!
