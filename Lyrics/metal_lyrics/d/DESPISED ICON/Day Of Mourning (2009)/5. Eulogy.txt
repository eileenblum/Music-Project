The embittered smell emanating from your lifeless form is as bitter as the reeking lies I've heard and trusted.
From now on, the only bed you'll be able to roll on will be within mother earth's guts.
As I'm lying down with closed eyes, I think of what you made me commit.
My fingertips caress your feminine curve for one last memorable moment.
This is a eulogy for my sweetheart.
Nothing will break us apart.
The mark around your neck is so seducing.
This is a eulogy for my sweetheart.
Nothing will break us apart.
The mark around your neck is so seducing.
Your disfigured face is marked by its agonizing grin.
As I hung up the phone to report my sin, I shed one last tear for our memories, kissed your pale lips and took my gun.
