Another morning when I feel more rotten than alive.
The reflection in the mirror across the room shows that I'm just another useless being, head down in a tobacco haze with a bottle of broken dreams in my hand.
I wonder if I was just gone, would anyone miss me?


Thanks to davidgrondin for correcting track #9 lyrics.
