Welcome to my team.
The game is on.
Play by the rules or you're gone.
I'm aiming for gold.

I'll pursue my goal and see how our night will finally unfold.
Stay cold or you'll get caught in this deceiving old game.
Extinguish that flame.

The road drew my muse away from me.
I gave up on us to live free.

Cursed with the appetite of a shark.
I'm looking out for the catch of the day.
All it takes is a clever remark and a smile to lure my prey.
Looks can betray.

I must fill the void.
Your bedroom, I enjoyed.
Please don't take this wrong.
For you, I wrote this song.
So long.

Oh yeah!
The game is on.
Play by the rules or you're gone.
Make way for this years MVP.

Oh, baby don't you know this party's picking up.
You be a classy looking hoe.
Girl, I promise that I'll be gentle and take it slow.
Put this thick member in your mouth and start to blow.

I'm the smouldering underdog you all dread,
plaguing your dreams with visions of the dead.
A violent pervert;
psycho-narcissistic scum of loathsome nature.

One more shot then let me aim for your weak spot.
One last key, now lets hit the parking lot.
You don't know my name, you don't know my game.
Ecstasy won't ever be the same.

It's hunting season.
An unsuspecting victim is in my sight.
Despite our slight conversation,
tonight we'll dance and end it in romance.
