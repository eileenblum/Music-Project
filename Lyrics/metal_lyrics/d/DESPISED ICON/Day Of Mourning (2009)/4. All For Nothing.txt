Getting better was just an option I didn't believe in.
Fuck no!
Until you came and lured me with a blurred vision of hope, my impenetrable mind was practically to be declared dead.
For so many months, I wandered in the cold abyss of your confusion.

I anticipated that when I came back you'd finally be mine.
But every time, you disappointed me with distant silence.
I saw someone for whom I would have kept my pledge.
La montagne russe que je suis n'est que le fruit de ton indÃ©cision.

L'homme qui tenait Ã renaÃ®tre est mort nÃ©e.
De ses cendres, la calamitÃ© jaillira pour te tourmenter.
Je t'ai abandonnÃ©.

All for nothing.
Getting better was just an option I didn't believe in.
Fuck no!
Until you came and lured me with a blurred vision of hope, my impenetrable mind was practically to be declared dead.
For so many months, I wandered in the cold abyss of your confusion.
