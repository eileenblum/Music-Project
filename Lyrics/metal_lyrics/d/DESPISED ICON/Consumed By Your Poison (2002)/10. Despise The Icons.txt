Sit on their glory - followed by the incorporated
Lifeless and disoriented
Infiltrated vain values
Determined and assimilated
Appreciated for their names
Created by and for the system
Emperor in their realms
Illusionists alienated
Icons, with their notoriety
Revealing an outfit for charlatans
Without social life, who are they?
Characterless
Disadvantaged by apprehension
Start to conjure for your future
I despise the icons.
