Disfigured stories from the mechanical eyes
You're contaminated, hypnotized by the box
Unwittingly addicted to his imperative need
Succubus of mankind, ingesting your life
Scene relative to action, Victimized by reality shows
To attest that you're not so offended by life
I can exhibit my supremacy on a survival program
Even if I lose, I will get sympathy from people
And tomorrow, I'll be at a late show
Always diverging on every channel
News casters interpret his vision his comments
Presenting facts from their own visualization
Human drama, traumatized situation Replayed for psychotic sentimentalists,
Meaningless soap of futility
Recreating plastic emotions
Mirror of our seedy creation
Problems of society written down by money-eyed producers
Cheapest stories, uninteresting scripts
Mystified zombies avid of the illusory
Disfigured stories from the mechanical eyes
You're contaminated, hypnotized by the box
Making a scoop with nobody: A child disfigured by his sister
Transsexual misogynist
Dysfunctional no-names
Howling his shocking life for money and empathy
Of the devouring audiences, vociferate Truth at loud To aware minds for a
long time eclipsed in the dream world
Revolting reality tragically offered
Indifference to outside, Nailed face to your world Transform in viewerÂ
only a viewer of erosion
Sensationalist in low budget, Hatred propaganda
Their real ending, a happy conclusion: evil will die, heroes will win?
