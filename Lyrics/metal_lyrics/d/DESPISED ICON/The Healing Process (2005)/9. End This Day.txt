Everything comes to an end
Castrate my tool, store it safely in a jewel case and throw away the key
Separation has tainted my comely sunny skies
Regret flows out of these open wounds
Rain on my parade
My confidence is soaked
Laughter has now lost all of its sincerity
Emptiness persists
I've never felt this much anger
A silent nemesis grins
I've never felt this much anguish
A pledge to inflict it tenfold
Shed these butterfly wings
Regain your larval state
Converge with every other insect
Your lips are sown with rusted barbwire
Swim in guilt to regain my trust
Stabbed in the back by a bitter secret
A portrait painted black
Shed these butterfly wings
Regain your larval state
My heart is abandoned on a silver plate
Her silence is as cold as a lifeless teenage corpse
Her delicate beauty has lost all of its purity
Her pale white skin marked by the foul sent of treachery
Castrate my tool, store it safely in a jewel case and throw away the key
Separation has tainted my comely sunny skies
I'll remember this day
