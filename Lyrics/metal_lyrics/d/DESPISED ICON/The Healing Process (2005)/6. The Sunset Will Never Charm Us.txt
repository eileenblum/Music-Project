This desire is so annoying, like a red hot rock in my palm
My nerves hurt and my legs convulse
Walking on broken glass
The soporific serenity permanently reflected in your charming face gives you jurisdiction
A soiled soul infects the spine during a segment of time
Particles of truthfulness suppurate from this almost perfect being
The eye of satisfaction disappears to give place to arrogance and discontent
I wait for a crucial gateway between trickery and facts
Someday the sun will vanish and give place to an appalling night
With cutting words I shall perforate this Kevlar curtain and leave you bare without protection
Beneath this strong and fierce eloquence, I will face what truly is your frail archetype
Guns and knives can hurt physically or even cause your demise
While speech and illustrations can mentally hurt and guide to suicide
The eye of satisfaction disappears to give place to arrogance and discontent
The Mozart effect reveals a newborn confidence
The reptilian brain is now the one involved, the one that will conquer them all
