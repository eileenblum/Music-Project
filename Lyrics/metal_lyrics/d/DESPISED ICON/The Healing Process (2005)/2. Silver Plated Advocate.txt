The art of silencing people
Murdering enemies is such a pleasurable task
Suppress any possible living/breathing threat from the equation
Empowered by the poisonous touch of my silver plated advocate,
I gently squeeze its trigger to paint him red
Decide a man's fate and impersonate god
I softly pull its trigger to pierce his flesh
Organs and ammunition properly acquainted with one another
My love for the gun grows stronger
Dedicated to extinction
My aim is as bold as his arrogance
I smile proudly as he trembles in the line of fire
The sight of a human spirit's weariness brings joy to this beholder
Witness the priceless look on his face as he savors the final moment of his shameful existence
The sight of a human spirit's weariness brings joy to this beholder
I aim for his head as I empty my charger in his direction
His blood stained tie and shirt will leave a lasting impression now
That he's been put to sleep by the lethal injection of my smoking barrel
