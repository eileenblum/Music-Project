Carry the burden, sedated by a clouded moment
As strength fades away, self-pity turns into nauseating grief
Desecrate my frail lungs and limbs
Anatomical balance tarnished
Affliction's kiss
Somatic functions inhibited
I stand tall to endure suffering then collapse in a heartbeat
Longing for bulletproof ScAles to sheild myself from this round of Russian roulette
My aching throat weeps crimson tears
A faint whisper taunts my ears
Scars spread their roots within my arms
I stand tall to endure anguish knowing that my tombstone has not yet been carved
Longing for bulletproof ScAles to sheild myself from this round of Russian roulette
Empathy revives the enemy lying within
A weakness so graceful, it blooms
I loathe everyone's concern for my undying flaws
Remember a time when my anger was nothing but a blank page
Desperatley needing to regain my thirst for optimism
Carry the burden, sedated by a clouded moment
As strength fades away, self-pity turns into nauseating grief
Hope is Forsaken
