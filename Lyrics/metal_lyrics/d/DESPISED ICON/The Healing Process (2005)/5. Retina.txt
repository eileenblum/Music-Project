Standing alone inside a frantic crowd with incriminating facts in hand
An imperative vision of satisfaction
My overwhelmed pupils contain illegible mortification
I feel the numbness of an orgasm as I leave my entire body
Endorphins are released, generating complete ecstasy
Standing alone inside a frantic crowd with incriminating facts in hand
An imperative vision of satisfaction
My overwhelmed pupils contain illegible mortification
I feel the numbness of an orgasm as I leave my entire body
Inside my cerebral cortex lies an ultimate pleasure better than any sensation
Turned into a powerless corpse, I succumb
My brain's mechanical capacity has clearly stopped running
Restrictions of flesh...
A magenta fluid escorts my soul to a perfect and reflexive coma
As I decline within this ideal trance
I can no longer feel pain
I only see my blackened blood flowing out of my veins, my carnal shroud
I'm not furious about what you've wrecked
In fact, I want to thank you, I want to love you
My blood flows. But at this instant, I'm not furious
No need to say a word
I leave with fervor covering my heart
