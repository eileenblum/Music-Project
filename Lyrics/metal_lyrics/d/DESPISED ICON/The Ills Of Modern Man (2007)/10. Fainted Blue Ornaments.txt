The acid reflux in my throat hasn't appeased my taste for bitter blondes
I've twisted so many necks and now their souls daily blind my mind

Your presence, I took for granted
I deceived your confidence

I'll never achieve emotional numbness,
Nor will I enjoy a single peaceful rest

Your presence, I took for granted
I deceived your confidence

Your angelic hand touches my venomous spine
through overwhelming nightmares
I now stand under this Damocles dagger

I'll kill again to lighten apathy towards me
The amazing brightness that makes you so precious
and exceptional tears me apart

I need your presence but my shadow is tarnishing your radiance

I feel remorse but unfortunate events
make my world uglier this morning
Repentance hurts but not enough
Let's start again tonight
