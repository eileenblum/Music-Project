Estranged
The bliss of a young man smoothly slivered in an instant
Obscured memories puncture through an opaque blindfold

Eyelids carved swiftly with oval shaped incisions
A breach in one self's fortitude
reveals a radiant smile struggling to resurface

Nostalgia plays its snivelling violin
I bleed pristine tears

Recollections of the son I once was
Stabbed my past with oxidized scissors and turned away

Awake, to salvage what is left before it dies away
An oath destined to be forgotten
Strong words are nothing more than heartfelt clichÃ©s

The times have changed and so have I
Childhood dreams reduced to pale aspirations

Familiar faces have shed their skin,
Spawning a newfound identity
A never ending pursuit of distinctiveness as blurred strenuous bonds in its path

Awake, to salvage what is left before it dies away
An oath destined to be forgotten
Strong words are nothing more than heartfelt clichÃ©s
