I have had it easy for most of my life
Adulthood has brought me a series of complications
Swallow these nails, turn away
I must not look back

The ills of modern man are much larger than my own personal battles
It feels like I have been fighting for nothing
The ills of modern man are much larger than my own personal battles
I have been too caught up in this crying game and I want out

I am sick of hearing myself whine
Drink this wine and choke

Here I am, still screaming away the same problems
that have fuelled this engine for years
I have bathed the faceless in a cesspool filled with my own tears

The ills of modern man are much larger than my own personal battles
It feels like I have been fighting for nothing
The ills of modern man are much larger than my own personal battles
I have been too caught up in this crying game
I quit

Deep down there is shade in all of us but there is also luminosity
My flaws have now been exposed by its brightness
