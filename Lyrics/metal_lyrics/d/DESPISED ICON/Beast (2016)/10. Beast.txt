Beast
Destroy all that I deplore
It's time, settle the score
I'll rightfully take whats mine
Beast
Destroy all those that oppose
Rivals will decompose
I'll rightfully take what's mine

Curse this new world
Thin the herd
A force to be reckoned with
You will plea for forgiveness
On your knees, bow to beast

Assuming a higher role
Tremble as I speak
Mankind is so weak
Take control
Take control
Assuming a higher role
Tremble as I speak
Mankind is so weak
Take control
Assuming a higher role
Rise and conquer, onward

Beast
Destroy all that I deplore
It's time, settle the score
I'll rightfully take whats mine
Beast
Destroy all those that oppose
Rivals will decompose
I'll rightfully take what's mine

Curse this new world
Thin the herd
A force to be reckoned with
You will plea for forgiveness
On your knees, bow to beast
You no longer hold the crown

Icon is back
On your knees, bow to beast
Icon is back
Icon is back
On your knees, bow to beast
Icon is back
Icon is back

Bloodshed is what I crave, open graves
No fear
Face first, keep your conscience clear
Bloodshed is what I crave, misbehave

Beast
Destroy all that I deplore
It's time, settle the score
I'll rightfully take whats mine
Beast
Destroy all those that oppose
Rivals will decompose
I'll rightfully take what's mine
