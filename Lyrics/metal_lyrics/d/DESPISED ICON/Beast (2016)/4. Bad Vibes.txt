Take a stand now
You give me bad vibes
You give me bad vibes

I don't trust that smile
You give me bad vibes
Been onto you for a while
You give me bad vibes
Trying to steal the game
Yet you stick to the sidelines
Come on, make your move
You give me bad vibes
Don't stall, stand once and for all

Don't pretend we're brothers
Show your true colors
My faith in you has rusted
You simply can't be trusted
Stop thinking you're so discrete
Or I'll show my teeth
My faith in you has rusted
You simply can't be trusted
Don't stall, stand once and for all

Keep on fronting, I've played this game
Talk up a storm but deep down
You're all the same
Lessons learned, bridges easily burned
Respect and loyalty must be earned

Don't pretend we're brothers
Show your true colors
My faith in you has rusted
You simply can't be trusted
Stop thinking you're so discrete
Or I'll show my teeth
My faith in you has rusted
You simply can't be trusted

Be on your guard, the one who holds the cards
Never to be trusted
Time heals nothing
Never to be trusted
No more games
All these concealed intentions and disregard
Be on your guard
The one who holds the cards
Never to be trusted
Time heals nothing
Never to be trusted
No more games

Take a stand now
You give me bad vibes
Spitting facts
Claiming it's all true
Drop the act
I can see right through you

I don't trust that smile
You give me bad vibes
Been onto you for a while
You give me bad vibes
Try to steal the game
Yet you stick to the sidelines
Come on, make your move
You give me bad vibes
Bad vibes
Bad vibes
Spitting facts
Claiming it's all true
Drop the act
I can see right through you
Don't stall, stand once and for all

Don't pretend we're brothers
Show your true colors
My faith in you has rusted
You simply can't be trusted
Stop thinking you're so discrete
Or I'll show my teeth
My faith in you has rusted
You simply can't be trusted
Don't stall, stand once and for all
