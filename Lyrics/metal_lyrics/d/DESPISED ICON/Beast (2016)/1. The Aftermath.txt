Laying low, lurking deep down below
Resurface, catch your breath
Rise back from the depths
Rise back from the depths
Rise up, rise back up
Rise back from the depths
Rise up, rise back up
Rise back from the depths

One more attempt
Suffer my wrath
Feel my contempt
The aftermath

The aftermath
Damn you all, put you all to sleep
I am not a saviour, nor am I a sheep
None can appease
Suffer my wrath
Down on your knees
The aftermath

No peace
Tear it all down, I will never cease
No rest, no peace
Tear it all down, tear it piece by piece

Laying low, lurking deep down below
Resurface, catch your breath
Rise back from the depths
Rise up, rise back up
Rise back from the depths
Rise up, rise back up
Rise back from the depths
Rise up, rise back up
Rise back from the depths

One more attempt
Suffer my wrath
Feel my contempt
The aftermath
End it all, carry out my plan
The ills of modern man
The aftermath
Damn you all, put you all to sleep
I am not a saviour, I will cut you deep
Watch as I feast
Suffer my wrath
Unleash the beast
The aftermath

No peace
Tear it all down, I will never cease
No rest, no peace
Tear it all down, tear it piece by piece
Tear it all down, tear it piece by piece

I'm in high gear with a lust for red
Stay clear, or better yet, play dead
Famished with a taste for blood
Make it bleed until it floods
The beast awakens

I'm in high gear with a lust for red
Stay clear, or better yet, play dead
The beast awakens
Famished with a taste for blood
Make it bleed until it floods
The beast awakens

Laying low, lurking deep down below
Resurface, catch your breath
Rise back from the depths
Rise up, rise back up
Rise back from the depths
