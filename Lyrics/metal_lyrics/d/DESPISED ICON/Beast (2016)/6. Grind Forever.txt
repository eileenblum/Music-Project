I am beaten, but not broken
I am beaten, but not broken
1, 2, 3, go
Crush my enemies
Grind forever
No more boundaries
Grind forever
Jump all obstacles
Grind forever
Grind forever

I was once found, but now I'm lost
Lost all trust
Watch me combust, burn as I'm condemned
March 'til the end
Don't you pretend
1, 2, 3, go

Crush my enemies
Grind forever
No more boundaries
Grind forever
Jump all obstacles
Grind forever
Grind forever

I am beaten, but not broken
I am beaten, but not broken
I'll rest when I'm dead
I'll rest when I'm 6 feet deep, in my new bed

I've slept enough
Lost my head in the clouds
I'll keep running and running
Never looking back again
IÂ¨ll keep running and running until my legs give in
Smashing through every single door
Paying all my dues like never before
I'll keep running and running, I swear
No fucks given, not a single care
Smashing through every single door
Je frappe Ã  grand coup
MaÃ®tre de mon sort

I was once lost, but now I'm found
Lost and found
There is a cost for those who bear the crown
March 'til the end
Don't you pretend
1, 2, 3, go

Crush my enemies
Grind forever
No more boundaries
Grind forever

I am beaten, but not broken
I'll rest when I'm dead
I am beaten, but not broken
I'll rest when I'm 6 feet under

Burn the candle by both ends
By both ends
By both ends
Pushing limits
Forcing my way through exits
