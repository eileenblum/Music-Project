Time is ticking away
I can't escape
Fate awaits
Can't escape
Fate awaits
Panic spreads through my tired shell
My mind is stuck deep in hell
I can't escape
Fate awaits
Can't escape
Fate awaits
Sorrow says, "Hello my old friend"
"On you, I'll always depend"
Time is ticking away
My body, I'll entomb
My mind goes tick tick, boom
My story, filled with gloom
Time is ticking away
Time bomb

Time bomb
Stay calm, easier said than done
Sit tight, shit has just begun
Panicked by negative outcomes
Time bomb

Fate awaits
Can't escape
Fate awaits
Panic spreads through my tired shell
My mind is stuck deep in hell
I can't escape
Fate awaits
Can't escape
Fate awaits
Sorrow says, "What is happening?"
"Stood by you through everything"
Time is ticking away
My body, I'll entomb
My mind goes tick tick, boom
My story, filled with gloom
Time is ticking away
Away

No turning back
No way
Time slowly wasting away
Wasting away
Slowly wasting away
Same excuses
Same old lines
Running out of time
Leave all fears behind
Time slowly wasting away
Wasting away
Slowly wasting away

So paranoid
Setting traps everywhere
Just can't avoid getting caught in despair

Time is ticking away
I can't escape
Fate awaits
Can't escape
Fate awaits
Panic spreads through my tired shell
My mind is stuck deep in hell
I can't escape
Fate awaits
Can't escape
Fate awaits
Sorrow says, "I thought we were friends"
"And all you did was pretend"
Time is ticking away
My body, I'll entomb
My mind goes tick tick, boom
My story will resume
