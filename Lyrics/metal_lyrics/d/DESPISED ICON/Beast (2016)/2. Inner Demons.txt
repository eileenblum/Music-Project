The dream is dead
Walk away
The pressure's pulling me down
A dark passenger
Pulling me down
Is slowly taking over
Sadness prevails
Clouded, my judgment fails
Pulling me down
Come to your senses
I've lost all my defences
State of distress
Haunted
My mind is a mess
It's over; all over
Suffer the consequence

Suffer the consequence
Deeper, dig deeper
Go on
Vanquish my inner demons
Deeper, dig deeper
Go on
Suffer the consequence

Salt all my wounds
I'm consumed by my poisonous views
Turn the page
Channel all that rage
Make it on my own
One must face the unknown
I'm setting up myself for disaster
Time's up, these 15 minutes are over
Turn the page
Channel all that rage
Make it in my own
One must face the unknown

Fighting from within
Struggling to survive
It's over; all over
Fighting from within
Struggling to survive
Vanquish my inner demons
Fighting from within
Struggling to survive
It's over; all over
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

Suffer the consequence
Deeper, dig deeper
Go on
Vanquish my inner demons
Deeper, dig deeper
Go on
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

Fuck my life

Trying my best to connect the dots
Self-repressed with conflicting thoughts
Trying my best to shed all my weight
I just can't sit around and wait
Empty days and sleepless nights
More clichÃ©s and countless fights
Tired eyes and hidden wounds
Silent cries and bitter tunes
Wake up, get up, move on
Give me a sign, a four leaf clover
Wake up, get up, move on
Wake me up when it's all over

I am my biggest threat
I am my biggest threat
I am my biggest threat
