So I lie, in my stench
Decorated in my self
Scarcely here, mind astray
In myself hate, I crawl away
I still burn for you...
I saw you bleed
Same mistake I made again, made again
Who am I, faceless mask
All what's left, cracked like glass
I still burn for you...
I saw you bleed
Same mistake I made again, made again
So if I burn
Would have done it all the same, all the same
So I lie, in my stench
Decorated in my fence
I saw you bleed
The same mistake
Don't fade away into the gray...
Don't fade away into the gray...
Don't fade away into the gray...
