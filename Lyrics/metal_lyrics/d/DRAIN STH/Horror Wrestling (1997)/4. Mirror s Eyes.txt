Turning into my mind
The mirror's eyes smile back at me
Fed me with your madness
Burnt the cradle to the ground
Created a beast of sadness
Now I'm searching to be found
Reaping the seed you sowed
Left alone to grow

Where do we go?
I don't know
Reaping the seed you sowed
Time has come, no longer care
I wanted love, you gave me fear
See my life broke in half
Frozen sea you left for me
See my life broke in half
