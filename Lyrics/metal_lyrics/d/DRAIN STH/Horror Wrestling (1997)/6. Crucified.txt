Seal your eyes and use them inside
See if you know who I am
Feed your lies and breed them a while
Meet them again when you're near
Under skin, left within
Seamless scars, can't deny
From the inside, Crucified
In silence, resentment bleeds through
Somewhere your past will resort
Feeling dry, I'm dying
You know why
Drained from the wound that won't heal
Under skin, left within
Seamless scars, can't deny
From the inside, Crucified
