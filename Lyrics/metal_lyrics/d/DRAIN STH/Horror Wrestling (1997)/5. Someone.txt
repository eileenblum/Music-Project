Set my soul to fly
Someone has to die
And I feel you
Someone has to die
And I feel you
Someone has to die
I know, I know...
You know, you know...
I'm the one to be
There can't be two of us in me
And I feel you
Someone has to die
And I feel you
Someone has to die
I know, I know...
You know, you know...
I know, I know...
You know, you know...
Someone has to die...
Someone has to die...
