Take me in your arms
I need to rest
Rest my head against your chest
Stop me from drifting
It feels like I'm fading away, away
Father, O Father, I know you can see
I'm in pain
Always remain, lost out in the rain
Help me to carry, carry the stone
Life's running out of an open wound
When twisting and turning
Endlessly burning you soothe, you soothe me
Seems every beat of my heart brings me
Closer to death, every breathe
All my candles have burned out
I wish there could be
Mercy for me
Begging on my knees
Praying to find peace
I wish there could be
Mercy for me
Begging on my knees
Praying to find peace
