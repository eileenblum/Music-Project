Deep inside the shell rankles the pain
Knee deep inside yourself, wreck of the insane
You serve the shame
You serve the shame
Loss to fill expose your will, use the child
simple needs, perversities, abuse the pride
Loss to fill, I'll be your sin, without name
simple needs, perversities, you serve the shame
Wallow in the deeds, Unable to feel
Too late to repent, this mind must be sealed
You serve the shame
You serve the shame
