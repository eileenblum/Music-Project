Turn inside yourself, ease your mind
Turn inside yourself, release your mind
My body's alive, but I'm not inside
And I see broken pictures, floating body over...mine
Floating high
What I only wanted was to fly
Turn inside yourself, ease your mind
Turn inside yourself, release your mind
Saw into your eyes, and death itself has been denied
And I see pictures coming clear
See your body next to...mine
Floating high
All I ever wanted was to fly
And I see pictures come alive
Broken faces, twisted smiles
I've seen enough and close my eyes
Can not live and can not die...
Mind floating high, all I ever wanted was to fly
