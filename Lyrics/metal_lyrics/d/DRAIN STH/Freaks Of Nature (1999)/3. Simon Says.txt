[Music-M. Martin, Axen/Lyrics-Sjoholm, Axen, Critchlow]

Be, I wanna be
Just like you, what you do I want too
Bleed, I'm gonna bleed
To belong I would give all you need

I would give my life to get some rest
But I'll do anything that Simon says...
"Throw your hands in the air
Wave 'em around like you just don't care"

Reap, I wanna reap
Everything that you sow I will keep
Creep, I'm gonna creep
And I'll do it again and again and again...

I would give my life to get some rest
But I'll do anything that Simon says...
"Throw your hands in the air
Wave 'em around like you just don't care"
