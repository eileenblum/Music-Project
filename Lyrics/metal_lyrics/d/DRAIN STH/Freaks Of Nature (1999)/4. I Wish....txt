Am I too corrosive
Am I just too weak
Am I too contagious
Am I just a freak

I wish that I could hold you
I wish that I could hate you
I wish that I could hold you one more time,
Just one more time

Am I what you made me
Am I what you'll reap
Am I all you dreamed of
or am I just a creep

I still see you in my mind I wish that I could have more time
I know that it will be just fine
All is well now, no need to cry,
no need to cry...
