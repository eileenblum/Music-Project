[Music-Canel, Axen, Kjellberg/Lyrics-Sjoholm, Axen]

Silence now the only sound
Shadows gathering around
Hiding thoughts inside my mind about you

I lost wat I just had to steal
What we had was so unreal
Bleeding scars I tried to heal in me

Get inside, fill my mind
Can't define, I don't know why I...
Get inside, fill my mind
Can't define, I don't know what I tried

Tried to live through sacred lies
Feelings had to be denied
I knew it all had to die away

Get inside, fill my mind
Can't define, I don't know why I...
Get inside, fill my mind
Can't define, I don't know what I tried
