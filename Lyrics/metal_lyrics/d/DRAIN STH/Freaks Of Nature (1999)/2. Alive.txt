[Music-Kjellberg, Axen/Lyrics-Axen, Sjoholm]

As my blood has turned to dust
And all has died that I have trusted
I no longer want to be here
I can't deny
I tried to die...

But I'm alive
Can you feel it deep inside?
I'm alive
Can you feel it deep inside?

I know you as I know my pain
And my betrayel was the same
'Cause all we needed then was just a lie
I can't deny
I tried to die...

But I'm alive
Can you feel it deep inside?
I'm alive
Can you feel it deep inside?
