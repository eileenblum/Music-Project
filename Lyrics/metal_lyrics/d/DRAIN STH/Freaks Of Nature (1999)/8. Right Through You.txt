[Music-M. Martin/Lyrics-Sjoholm, M. Martin]

I recall the scent of you when everything was fine
I remember all the words stuck inside my mind
Cause all the promises were nothing else but lies
I don't have to look at you to see it in your eyes

I see right through you
Everything's broken
I see right through you
Everything's gone

Everytime I close my eyes I picture you inside
Though I know I've lost it all, forever you'll be mine
But all the fears inside lme left me with your lies
I just have to look at you to see it in your eyes

I see right through you
Everything's broken
I see right through you
Everything's gone

Now I'm leaving this behind
I'll erase you from my mind
You were never meant to be mine
