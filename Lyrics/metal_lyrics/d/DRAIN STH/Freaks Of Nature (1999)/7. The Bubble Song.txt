[Music-Canel, Kjellberg, Axen/Lyrics-Axen, Sjoholm]

So, if I rip your skin
Eating my way deeper within
So, let my be your sin
Don't know my face
Let me sink in

All my life, drained of emotion
I never cried
What am I now, a lack of devotion
I never tried to stay insane

Why did you leave me
Wish you were here
So, let me be your fears
Wish it was over
Drowning in tears

All my life, drained of emotion
I never cried
What am I now, a lack of devotion
I never tried to stay insane
