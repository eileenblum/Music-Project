[Music-Kjellberg, Axen/Lyrics-Axen]

And so I can't ignore, my heart is bruised and sore
My sanctuary has been raked, been raked
My soul is coloured red, from all the love I bled
My crucifixion is complete, complete
Now I need a substitute for...

...the love that you gave
Now I just can't be saved
And there is no salvation for me, yeah
My sin was to touch
But I wanted it too much
Now I know that I've fallen from grace, yeah

No matter how I try, I just can't justify
My absolution is denied, denied
And so I'm left to burn, my body craves and yearns
The beast inside me is alive, alive
Now I need a substitute for...

...the love that you gave
Now I just can't be saved
And there is no salvation for me, yeah
My sin was to touch
But I wanted it too much
Now I know that I've fallen from grace, yeah
