[Music-Canel, Axen/Lyrics-Axen, Sjoholm]

Feed me with my pride, satiate the liar
Bleed me in your arms, let me be devoured

Now you see me, now you don't...

You see, the leech is fed but I can't deny
The blood that was bled really wasn't mine
I said I loved you, you should know I lied, lied...

Lead me to the light, blind me with devotion
Read me, I rely on all of your emotions

Now you see me, now you don't...

You see, the leech is fed but I can't deny
The blood that was bled really wasn't mine
I said I loved you, you should know I lied, lied...
