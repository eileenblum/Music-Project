[Music-Iommi, Axen, Kjellberg/Lyrics-Axen, Sjoholm]

Burnt the flowers in my hand, I was almost there
You denial my demand, I was already there
Now I'm losing who I am
Save me now cause all I am is black

Black is black

Turned the water into salt, I was almost dead
Never tried and lost it all, I was already dead
Almost there...
Now I'm losing who I am
Save me now cause all I am is black

Black is black
