[Music-Kjellberg, Axen/Lyrics-Sjoholm]

Precious burdon I capture deep inside
What would my life be without pain in me?

I rely on what you need, devour what you feed
'Cause what I try to breed is me in you
There's no one else to blame, this is my favourite pain
And all I want to gain is myself in you

Wrath is glowing now through my sunken eyes
Pain is growing I'm jaded from your lies

I don't know why but it's the best way to die
You are the trigger and my deepest desire
I'm losing you, but you will always be mine
Promise me now that you will enter my mind, enter my mind, enter my mind...
