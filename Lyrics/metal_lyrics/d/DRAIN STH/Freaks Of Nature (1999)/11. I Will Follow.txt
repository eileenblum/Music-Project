[Music-Kjellberg/Lyrics-Axen, Sjoholm, Kjellberg]

Understand my mind
I know you'd like to find
The needs you hide inside
You'll see them if you try

I can't remember
I can't remember...

I will follow, needs so hollow

See me now my friend
Be my game, what I pretend
Everything's too late
All what's left is hate

I can't remember
I can't remember...

I will follow, needs so hollow
