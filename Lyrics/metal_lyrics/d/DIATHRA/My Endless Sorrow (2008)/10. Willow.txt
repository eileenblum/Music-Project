The dozing willow declined so beautifully
And she was naked with sad noise
Her tears-leaves were like hailstones
Her dying brunches was so gloomy

The gods see I could not leave her,
I tried to understand her grief
I looked for it in the bottomless depths
And transparent endless sky

I embraced her so gentle
And kissed her slim trunk
But she was like fancy bride
Which suffered about her fate.
