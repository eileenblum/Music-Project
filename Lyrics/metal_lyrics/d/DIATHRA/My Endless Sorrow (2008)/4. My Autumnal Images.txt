The maiden-autumn, kiss my lips
Like morning dew touches
amber foliage
Give me your love, your innocence.
So be my dream my fate, my sorrow

You've blessed by wind from
color silk
So don't afraid, be my forever
Call me with smell of plowed field
And don't stop temping me forever

I draw your image in the pools
I burn myself in flame of passion
I understand I need your cool
I always want to live in tension.
