The sunsets and light dies away
This is the time when the moon rules
It's the one time when the moonlight has found me
This is the night my soul gets its wings

I close my eyes, and fly up freely
I close my eyes, and there are no boundaries
I close my eyes, and I behold my dreams
I close my eyes, and joy overwhelms me

In my dreams you a frequent visitor
Your shape is shifting like a crafty flame
Your knowledge is beyond this world
Despite the danger I'm still drawn to your flame

I close my eyes, and you are there
I touch you and I experience a living fire
I was warned that you are a dangerous beast
But I know, that you are still a capable of love.
