Autumn, your foliage falls in slow dance turning,
Infinite flying from the ancient trees,
And rolling in emerald green grass
Gradually dies.

And in fact, all seemed colorful recently
And among fading dying beauty
I saw all your endless despair,
All your bottomless sorrow.

You cover the tired ground
With foliage
And mysteriously embracing me
You kiss so passionately, and temping
And I would like to be with you only.
