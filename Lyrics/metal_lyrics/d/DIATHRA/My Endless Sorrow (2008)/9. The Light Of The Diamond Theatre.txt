In the mountains where I sought the secret of the world,
I saw the girl-autumn
She waited
And in the twilight, she took me to a vast desert
Where we stood before the light of the diamond theatre

I'll find you, and I'll learn all about you
Ordinary or princess you will be mine

Oh, girl-autumn, you have shown me the magic of day
You have told me that all roles
Are simple
You've taught me to live,
Brilliantly and daringly
You've taken the radiance and weaved it in my hair.
