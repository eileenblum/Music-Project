Your own universe
I have my world and you live there
but your love's great for it
You want to have your own universe
Without tears evil, temptation
Where moon lie and pretend

I show your way but you'll go alone
And you should go the opposite side
And a mint rainbow will be your road
So you will come to this world with
the mint rains.

And it'll become your own universe
which you will fill with sincere love
And love become the main law of live
And you'll become the GOD!!!!
Don't lose your way!!!
