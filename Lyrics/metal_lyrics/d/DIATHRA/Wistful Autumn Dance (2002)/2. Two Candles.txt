As a November rain being immersed in sad memories 
So the broken dreams fill my heart with suffering 
Dancing flame there is nothing more perfectly you. 
And similarly to naked maid your wax flows down as tear 

[Chorus:]
Two candles - the crying, grace,
Two candles - dies

Her magnificent image dies away among indifferent shadows 
The silent images of the past sign a mourning song 
Where gold of sad phrases to reason to a string adjoining 
And where the candle so modestly was horn and also modestly dies 

[Chorus:]
Amber's Shine of the stiffened wax the hung strokes and flame of candles,
Pearl of grief are covered cool, thawing by grey darkness,
And as a November rain being immersed in sad memories
So the broken dreams fill my heart with suffering
