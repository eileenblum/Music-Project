I drown in white roses 
In embrace of the autumn  - whore 
Her caress, her lying love 
Her candid desires, is dead

[Chorus:]
Oh, wistful autumn dance 
Leave me a last time in
Velvet embrace 

Where emerald - yellow foliage 
Where the dance a similar to winds 
In a fairy-tale I feel myself 
You the goddess or dirty whore 
You beauty or gentle Queen
