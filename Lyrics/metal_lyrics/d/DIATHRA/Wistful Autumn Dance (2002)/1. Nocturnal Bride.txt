Not time to turn at beauty's glance 
The sorrow mine with death can dance 

[Chorus:]
Nocturnal bride 
Dismal mine cry 
A tragical kind 
Sweet roses yours

Is not present time to wait lor eternal promises 
Forgive me for emptiness of words 

[Chorus:]
In foggy embrace you'll embrace me 
The admiration of your eyes is tragedy
