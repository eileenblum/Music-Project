There, where my ashes as flesh, 
And where the thorns remind roses, 
Where complete ocean of sufferings, 
And where the soul is absolutely empty, 

Only one sigh now to me is necessary... 
That of ashes would become flesh for ever, 
Drinks you poison and all sufferings 
Will disappear as if a wind 

[Chorus:]
Part of soul my sufferings, 
Are to similar particles of dust 
By the carried away winds, 
And mournful memory of centuries.
