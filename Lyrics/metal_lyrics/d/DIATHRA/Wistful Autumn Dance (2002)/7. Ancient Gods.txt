The heavens were unwrapped by a bloody wound
And on ground has found a fiery rain
Last of stayed in alive
The debts of the dead men should pay. 

[Chorus:]
Ancient Gods so bless my enemy 
Ancient Gods I'm fight the 
Brandish sword I take in my hand 
Ancient Gods I'm pray.

And above a valley ring swords
Again in fatal fight converge of a hells regiment
Vote of steel and shout of flesh here is audible
The death collects the bloody fax. 

[Chorus:]
Here fury of fight and shine of a furious eye 
The sword splits boards and flesh 
With each minute ever more than enemies perishes 
Ever more than soul departs to the ancient gods.
