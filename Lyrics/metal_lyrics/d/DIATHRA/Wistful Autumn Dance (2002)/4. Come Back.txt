We are together with you far long time 
We loved each other so much 
You present me so many days 
But why will I live without you 

[Chorus:]
Come bad to me I ask you
Come bach to me my love
I do want to be close to you
And I will come to you my angel wait for me 

No I'm lonely all over the world 
And I'm crying all the time 
You did I don't know how to live without you 
So the end of my life will be the river, deep river
