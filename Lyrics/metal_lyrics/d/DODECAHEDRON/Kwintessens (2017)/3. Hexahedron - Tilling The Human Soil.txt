Adam, forefather
The geometrical skeleton
created in the image of god
Memento mori
Greatest architect of the universe
Impermanent character
manifested in thy heart,
so you cannot escape

From the fall onwards,
we discover the principle
In the hearts of its offspring,
creeping along
Confronting all we so preciously built
Bare branches and bones
Whispering formulas
Cracking all structures

The mouth of heaven foaming
Vomit on the bodies of god
Amethyst mist dissolving all figures
Unending vistas of grey

Refusing to move
The dawn within myself
New light shining
Looking with sick eyes in this blinding star
Reflecting something long forgotten
Lain dormant all these aeons
to rise once more
Setting sun sending its rays through the pyramid

Identify
with the body of the sphere
Faces turn into death masks
Colorless skull watching
Initiate
Blazing star
The grand Arcanum
Sacred pentagram

Amethyst mist dissolving all figures
Unending vistas of grey

Penetrate these secrets
I know the existence
A grave roar that rises
in my black rotten heart
These secrets, existence, that rise
in my black rotten heart
