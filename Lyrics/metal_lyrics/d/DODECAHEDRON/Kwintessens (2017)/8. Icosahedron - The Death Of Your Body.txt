Digging into the soil
The manifested madness
showing us remarkable quests
May thy be those goals
During our stay
between the grinding wheels of the great design
our souls crushed between the teeth

Flesh reduced to rags
Pierced through all possibilities
and plunged into the abyss
Time will be reversed
Too much to suffer
Lost in the depths of our pain

Consciousness faded
The black hole will be the last to be seen
Natural laws will not apply
Idiosyncrasy
Not one piercing eye
Not one prophetic clear view
Not one prophetic clear view

Over our nightly executioners
This hunger
for perfection
flooding our eyes
A demon in disguise

Look at the omnipotent one
Grey, meager, and bent
Ready to be cut down
by scythe and fire

The essence made our hearts shrivel
No prayer from the west
nor from the east
could save you from your megalomania
Instead of wandering in dreams,
intoxicated by chants and incense
Prowling and yearning
You will die
Strung out in that rich embrace
The real commencement of the body of god
This earthly commandment
This earthly commandment
