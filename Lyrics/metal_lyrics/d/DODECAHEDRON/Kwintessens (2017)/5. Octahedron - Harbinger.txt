Its slender frame
felt like barren stone
inside a black covering,
hovering above the horizon
Drone of death
Drone of creation

The whole form
expressing only will and power
It was soon lost to sight,
manifesting growth
The birth of life
The end of all
Drone of creation
Drone of death

No signs of human feeling
Heavy leaden curtains covering all
physical fatigue and mental suffering
Hide away in your den

I will be retreating
It will be advancing
Like a serpent of material life
seeking to devour its children
Taking unto itself wings
to fly into the dryness of the eternal desert
The shadow was that of a vault
A protestation
of the prophetic spirit life

Condemning the east and west
Blackness surrounding all
I read it in the figure, gleaming in darkness
I can feel it drawing near â deep vaults, closing doors

Gathering and boring down
from the fathomless shadows
Hopeless we are, fighting
behemoths
Becoming a monster,
a receiver

Penetrating the core
Finding destruction
Into the labyrinth,
in hardness against themselves
Becoming a monster,
a receiver
Drone of creation
Drone of death

Into the labyrinth I go
In hardness against themselves and against others
Turning inwards, gathering the strength for self-conquest
