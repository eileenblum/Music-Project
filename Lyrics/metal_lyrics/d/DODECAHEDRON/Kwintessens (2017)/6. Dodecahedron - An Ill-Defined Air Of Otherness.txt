Liquid gold running through my veins
Staring in the sunâs reflection
Key to the physical and spiritual gateway
Golden lining, holy mercury
Develop the elixir
Connecting all empires of reality
Now feel the kwintessens
North, south, east, and west, not female nor male

The balance unspoilt
North, south, east, and west
Not male nor female
The balance unspoilt

Etheric element,
soul of the universe
Connecting microcosm
Connecting macrocosm

Animal, mineral, and nature,
under earth and over heaven
Ascending Jacobâs ladder
from the subterranean caverns â transmutation

Enter the matrix
Platonic soul,
present in all
Every song will be a prayer
Descending the body
Every dance will be a sacrifice
to the king
dressed in yellow

Blessed stone,
pneuma
Golden chain
Flaming star
Death of your king
The seal of Solomon
Putrefaction,
purgation

The death of your body
The death of your body
The death of your body
The death of your body
The death of your body
The death of your body
The death of your body
