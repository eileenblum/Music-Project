When the iron
enters our solar bodies once more,
renewing
all our festering wounds

The energy oozing
Chaos leaking from the gashes

This is what will start the cure
Manâs wisdom, either through godâs revelation,
or through the service of the angels and the spirits,
or through the sharpness and the depth of understanding

The primal source opened
Translating all hidden thoughts

Triad of flames,
scorched by the maternal fire
Ashes scattered in your face
Your ashen face screaming at me
To heal these wounds
The four corners of this earth
Bleeding precious energy
seems like a mission impossible
I am slow of speech
and slow of tongue,
but my deeds will rage
The secrets of my spirit
cannot and will not
be communicated to those feeble men
cannot and will not
be communicatedâ¦

I, the keeper of mysteries
I am depicted with fingers to my lips
Commanding violent
raging silence
