Longing for nights filled with peril
Remember all ye that existence is pure joy
Winds silencing deathbells to a dull tinkling
The sorrows are but as shadows
They pass and they are done
Stomachs twisting under a grey concrete heaven
Man has the right to love as he will
As the lice are leaving cold bodies
In search for a new host
Where they will dwell

I keep on longing for a site that can bear no eyes upon it
All those wicked devils that walk the earth
The stench wrapping around us like a wet blanket
Scarlet whores bestriding us
Waving grass and the tearing of spinelike trees
The infinite cosmos through the egocentric eye in the pyramid
Breath whistling through our mouths

As we keep longing for the inevitable woe upon others
Soft and hollow
Coins blinding eyeless sockets
The sound of flute in dim groves that haunts the hills
Ghostly foundations of humanity resounding with moaning
Avoiding many of the false paths structuring the chaos

We are descending Jacob's ladder
