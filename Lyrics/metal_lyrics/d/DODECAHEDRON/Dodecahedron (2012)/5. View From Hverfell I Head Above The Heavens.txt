Overcome death
Stare into the blistering light
Inside a womb
Enshrouding all creatures dark
Freezing cold and frosting bloom
Of that most pleasing beauty
Which sprang from your heathen fire
Hellish infusion
The word from below
Through the black earth recited
Words took on flesh
Beyond all creatures savage and true
The cold chilling embrace
Thy physical body
Thy temporary connection

With the harmony from underneath
The outer and material world
Sounding out in all creatures
Flesh is pure

Like the turf on which dew falls
The wonderous splendor
O creator of life and death
Unknown to mankind

Overcome death
Stare into the blistering light
Thy physical body
Thy temporary connection

Like the turf on which dew falls
The wonderous splendor
O creator of life and death
Unknown to mankind
