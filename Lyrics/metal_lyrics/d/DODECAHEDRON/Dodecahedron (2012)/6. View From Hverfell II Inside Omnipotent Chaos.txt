When the word of God burned me
It has led me astray on forsaken paths
Remaining with feverish remains
Miracles will be undone
There are no stars here
Eyeless sockets of midnight
My feet below hell
Tremble before the throne of night
Savage equilibrium

Embracing this nature perfectly
Where God touches others in the fire of doves
I will fall facedown in the mire
Eating blackened soil
Through my mouth
I curse in the city of God

When the dawn lits up
Inside a hole in my chest all is swallowed and will die
The hills and trees should bend down
Standing on marble columns
Through your mouth savouring old sour wine
Wells freeze
The source below dried out
In our teachings all unlearnt

Vast nocturnal horizons appear
When you gathered to yourself the bundles
The stone crumbled under my touch
Cry freedom
My shackles broke
Through my mouth I curse in the city of God
To vomit and urinate
