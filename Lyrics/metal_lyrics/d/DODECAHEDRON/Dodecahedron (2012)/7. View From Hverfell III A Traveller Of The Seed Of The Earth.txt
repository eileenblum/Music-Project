Vast landscapes
Stretched shadows
Descending through the earth
Cast down
Obscurity shines
Exile by choice
Drunk on the scent of blood
Shining through the bounds of impurity
A gable on the cloisters of hell

(Man has the right to die when and how he will)

For in your mind
A boiling spring
Giveth forth the purest streams
Along the way of death
Revealing the crown
The temple of the cornerstone
The one eye in the pyramid
Nourishing witness
The one eye
The one and only light
A great tower made of limbs
Shrouding the pinnacle in smoke and foul rancid fumes

Stand on high
Abashed before goddog
Leaping laughter
Force and fire are of us
Sweet end and blessed perseverance
A glorious darkness
Inverted destroyed Jerusalem
I will have this reward
Stand on high
Abashed before goddog
Leaping laughter
Force and fire are of us

For in your mind
A boiling spring
Giveth forth the purest streams
Along the way of death
Revealing the crown
The temple of the cornerstone
The one eye in the pyramid
Nourishing witness
The one and only light

Stretched shadows
Descending through the earth
Cast down
Exile by choice
Drunk on the scent of blood
Shining through the bounds of impurity
A gable on the cloisters of hell
