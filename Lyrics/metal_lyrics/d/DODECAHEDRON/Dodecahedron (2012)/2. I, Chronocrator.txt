The birth of nothingness that cometh forth
Breeze becomes unraveling storm
Vortex swallowing birds of heaven
Sand grinding teeth
Cracking bones

All our limbs will become a mockery
Showing wounds in shame
Man will fade in front of the pillars of chaos
Behold our tired bodies
Your eyes should not yield
Until your own bones show
Before the beginning of time

Taking root in the grey and green
Fertile grounds
Barren wastes
The power within dust and ash
Lilith's eternal kiss
Reigning formulas undone
Oaths sworn into silence

Final burnt offerings being made
Before the pillars of chaos
Our world will be without form
Our earth will be void
Darkness
Uncreated in his own image

Confusion and poisoning
All shall kneel in front of the pillars of chaos
Philosophers and madmen

Reigning formulas undone
Oaths sworn into silence
Our world will be without form
Our earth will be void
