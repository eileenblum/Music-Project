As we sink below
Embracing shadow
Embracing emptiness
The vapour surrounding us
As we enter the nothingness
Nothing is all
Chaf
As we make the effort
To no extend at all
Drudging away under a sunlit sky
This piece of soil will be your very gravepit
Bodies freezing with sweat
Feces and urine
Woman
Bear your children
Mere for the lives filled with anguish
Sun setting in our hearts

Gazing into the abyss
Trees robbed of their shadows
Do as prisoners
Do as the worthless
To cherish a hope beyond all hope
Walking on corpses
Slipping
White weak flesh heaving under our boots
Treacherous bones falling

Kneedeep in mud and black blood
Anxious white eyes lurking
Man sowing
Man building
Temples of painted and defleshed bones
Singer of songs

The sweetest of love burning pale
Dogs unworthy of flock
Howling
The elixer of life washed away
Fleeing for the grand leveller
Nothing what it seems

Not a single word whispered

Deceit strides onward like a god of gold
Lies will last eternally
Wisdom be gone
In an omnious darkness disconsolate
Crawling through the desert without might
The hunger
The lack
Insanity on parade
Weak of will
Savage hearts empty
Non-existance
The great absence of god
The great god
The great absence of god
The great god
