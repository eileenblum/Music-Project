Not only in the midst of night of years
But every day of the year
The light freezes
Yearning for angeltongues
To hunger for malice
On our side of the hourglass
Not willing to dream
Eternal summer
In the house of our fathers
Longing for earthly days
Of torture and murder
Never to rejoice
A world forced in between
This perpetual stain
Forcing all eyes down

Arms folding
Another body ready for the rack
Eyes open under earth
The raping of funerals
Mothers
Wives and sisters
None left to mourn them
Their destiny equalling bitterness
Last supper will be the cold desolate earth

Never to rejoice
A world forced inbetween
This perpetual stain
Forcing all eyes down

Sand and mud filling mouths

Sweeping the plains of nevermore
Ready for all
Entering the final moment
This final moment
Erasing life in the blink of one opened eye

All remaining
Will perish into dark limbo
No trace left
On a spinning burning sphere
This is the flesh that we are
Nature of things will transform
Bodies renamed

Corpses will not bear names no more
Unclassified
Unnamable
Not one language
Not one tongue
Exclaiming
None of characters
No figures left to form
