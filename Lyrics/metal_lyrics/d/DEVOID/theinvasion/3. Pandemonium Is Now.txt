No use turning away
This wave now blackening out the world
Prophecy now stands in the way
Future is looking down
Embers rise and fall
Behind this Ghoulish Wall
The world now hangs in balance
Truth unfolds through a dead manâs eyes

Pandemonium Is Now
As the blood flows
Every life now counts
They have got to die
It is one for all
Though none for one

Pandemonium Is Now
Let the blood flow
Every life you take
Is one that counts
Ascend to madness
Alive

While the blood flows
Bludgeoningâs now second nature
Blunt force, exerting the fight for survival
Brave is the one that deals the blow
As the blood flows
Every life now counts
They have got to die
It is one for all
To stay alive

Broken, but not defeated
Every fiber in your body
Will burn to kill
Shaken, yet undeterred
Every muscle clenched
To rid this Evil

Rampant, Dissonant, Frenzy
To bathe in the fire that consumes on all
Trudge away
Along the Path of Self-destruction
The fate of the brothers who will die in arms
Will bathe in the fire that is
Slowly, but surely
Siphoning all hope now
Rampant, Dissonant, Violent Frenzy

The World Wakes Up to its Funeral
Under the benevolence of your Gods
Donning the ashes of civilizations
This could be our fall

It is a game that when starts
Will surely end at some point
You wonât think twice to kill
If it lets you live
Weâre all the same
Primal and Inane
There is no shame
If you happen to die for someone elseâs gain
The dice is rolled
The blood will flow
The end is just a prelude to another
You wonât think twice to kill
If it lets you live
The Countdown Beginsâ¦
