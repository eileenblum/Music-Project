They are, they are coming

They are, they are coming
The clock stands still empty seconds remain
Silent whispers in the wind carry a message of fear
Life pulse of earth dissolves in the heavy rain
Each drop now draining in through this sphere

They are, they are coming

Bated breath and an awesome sight
At a loss of words, scared and brought to tears
Here lies down where the clouds unite
The ugly truth of inevitability slowly appears

Earthly ties will disappear
Every breath will take you near
Cover now as an act of fear
The terror is clear
No Gods interfere
The judgement is fucking here

Stupefied, paralyzed
In dismay, the world shall stare
Zombified, in divide
Petrified.
For they are coming now.

The invasion is nigh.

The ignorance of the human mind
Now shattered in the eyes of the billions
A light so bright it left them blind
A hum so powerful a force in fruition
A thunder that tears through the sky
Horizons left in sunder

The ignorance of the human mind
Now shattered in the eyes of the billions
A light so bright it left them blind
A hum so powerful a force in fruition
Flames slip through cracks in the sky
Tremors from the ground under
