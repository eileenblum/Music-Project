Hold down by tubes
Drops of the essence that strengthens life
Trickles down the veins
That forms a conscious conscience
Malaise is spread
Through the lands like fire

This essence finds its way
A beacon that stands to inspire
There is no one without the other
A meaning they derive
If only they exist together

Through writhing pain and spasms
Malaise unleashes
From the depths of its chasms
The weakening
The framework to this plan
Is built on imperfections
The causality that exists
Is the Grand Design

A burn that bends time
And extends days through nights
This burn now spreads
Through the lands so feverishly hot
And ever changing
As flames engulf the lands
Suddenly something changes
The world blackens out
And now everything freezes

Witness the Grand Design
Witness the Grand Plan

All things that come to an end
Are reborn with the gift of time
A cycle appended from its past
Alterations in its natural selection
The Design is the master of all creation

All things that come to an end
Are reborn with the gift of time
A cycle appended from its past
Alteration is the order

Can you change yourself?
Can you change the spell?
Can you?
Will you brave the fall?
Will you save the fall?
Or will you break it?
Canât you change yourself?
Canât you change the spell?
Canât you?
You canât brave the fall
This Design is Godless

Hold down by tubes
Drops of the essence that strengthens life
Trickles down the veins
That forms a conscious conscience
Malaise is spread
Through the lands like fire

Through writhing pain and spasms
Malaise unleashes
From the depths of its chasms
The weakening
The framework to this plan
Is built on imperfections
The causality that exists
Is the Grand Design
