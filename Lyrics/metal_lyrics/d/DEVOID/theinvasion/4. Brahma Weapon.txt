The fury descends on humanity
A display of force never seen before
The final act of power
Obliteration on a whole
Extinction is the true face of horror
That beckons a new age soon to come
Hear the call of the Creator
Evolution has taken control

Counter-Attack
Will only result in failure
There is no defense
To keep us safe
It destroys
Till the eyes that see
It never misses
It never recedes
The mark is upon us
No place to hide and
No place to flee
The land will be gone
With no trace of life
And a drought
That will last through the coming of the years
It is time to start the cleansing of the seed
The weapon of Gods
The intent of Gods
The mark is upon us
No amount of prayers can set you free
Here is the last of the blinding light
Embrace your fate
Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb

Shockwaves clear the skies
Feeding the drowning sun
Complete Annihilation
Mass extinction
The righteous burnt
The wicked singed
The worldâs come full circle
Baptized in fire

âThe true human-being descends from the stars
As we hybrids realize for the first time the idea of a Godâ
Here lies leveled in the rubble of change
The course of time, the true maker
The power of a cycle has now come to pass
Making everything a product anew resurfacing

As we now stare at the face of the world destroyer

The Brahma Weapon
