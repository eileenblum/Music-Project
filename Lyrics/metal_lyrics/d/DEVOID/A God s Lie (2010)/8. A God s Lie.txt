A book you lay your life down for
The word of God disturbed through
Time has no essence
Commanding spirits
Outrageous holy scriptures
Your God's forgiving nature a fallacy
This God condemned you for life
You live a life of a slave to a book
A book you call the The Truth
Of all lies you're brainwashed
Wake up and smell the void
Collection of lies and fables
Mend you life
Selection of the one true lord
Will save you life
Salvation and praising the likes of
Your one true god
A rat race to religious supremacy
Of this lying God
I am not afraid to
Expose these lies about you
I am not afraid to
Deny your existence
A forceful acceptance
Undeniable decadence
You Will Die in this world of yours
In search of light through you blinded
Eyes of the God unfaithful lot
Fuck you holy scriptures
Dead inside and crucified
Wake up and smell the void
A baseless stand of propaganda
Supported by a broken crutch of faith
Hate and scorned I loathe your kind
You cling to your God for your dear life
A righteous spirit I'd love to see
Bleed before me and cry for mercy
You are a character in a fucking lie
You live a fucking lie
It's time to tear down the walls
A god's Lie
Your God's Lie
A God's Lie
Your God's a fucking Lie.
Collection of lies and fables
Mend you life
Selection of the one true lord
Will save you life
Salvation and praising the likes of
Your one true god
A rat race to religious supremacy
Of this lying God
I am not afraid to
Expose these lies about you
I am not afraid to
Deny your existence
