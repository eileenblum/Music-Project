Perimeters guarded
Mother land's at stake
There is no god today
Gorund units arrive
Bloodlust is the answer
The Flying demons are on their way
Battle cry
The blood drunks roar
Battle Cry
Today they die
Formations of horror
Overwhelming power
They will feel a world of pain
Screaming vengeance
Felling millions
Today we feast today they burn
Neutralized
We act as one
Impenetrable force
Pray to your lord to save your life
They come in numbers
But they count for nothing
Say your prayers because now you die
Our knives will be tearing the enemies
From ear to ear deafening screams
There will be no prisoners of war
Today we propagate - hate
Fear the battle cry
Fear the battle cry
Perimeters guarded
Mother land's at stake
There is no god today
Gorund units arrive
Bloodlust is the answer
The Flying demons are on their way
Battle cry
The blood drunks roar
Battle Cry
Today they die
Formations of horror
Overwhelming power
They will feel a world of pain
Screaming vengeance
Felling millions
Today we feast today they burn
Neutralized
