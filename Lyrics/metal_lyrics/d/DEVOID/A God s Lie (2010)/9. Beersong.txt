[Bonus Track]Beer. Beer. Beer. Beer.
At the very sight
Oh the delight
Refreshing cold
In the amber of light
There is a party tonight
Don't care for an invite
So call all your buddies
Drink up and get fucking tight
Kingfisher is on the house
Budwiesers chips in dips and some sauce
Fuck your boss &amp; fuck your boring life
You know you want it
You know you need it
Beer. Beer. Beer.
What?
Beer. Beer. Beer.
That's right
Drink it from a bottle
Or from under the keg
Get liquored up big time and
Then wake up and have a peg
The smoke is in the air and the world is on a quake
You don't care two hoots
You're drunk and you want something to break
Kingfisher is on the house
Budwiesers chips in dips and some sauce
Fuck your boss &amp; fuck your boring life
You know you want it
You know you need it
Beer!
Get cracking
And drinking
All that fucking beer
Enjoying
And smoking
The flavors' in the motherfucking air
What?
Get cracking
And drinking
All that fucking beer
You live just once
You live it well
Cause the spirits' high in your doleful little head
Bottoms' Up!
Cheers!
