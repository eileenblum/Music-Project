If you hear this then you're breaking free
You belong with all of us in this dream
You're the boss of what you see
Now get up and fucking scream
Listening to metal since ten
Snarling voices of heart
Outcasts and rampants were called they
Sadistic tunes of art
Chaotic rhythm and the pounding drums
A soul less body's carnal needs
When the hair at the back of your neck stands
You know you are the part of the hate cult
A group of indignant souls
Assemble in the smoke filled hall
And you find yourself in the centre
Of the vicious void
Exploding noise sets them free
And this growing circle comes crashing down
Flying around those free hand punches
And you find yourself involved
Now you are a part of the hate cult
Now you are a pride of the hate cult
You are a part of the hate cult
You belong to the hate cult
Blotting out the sun
We're here in numbers
That you just can't ignore
We are here to stay
Till the best stops to play
Hate Cult
We're the world in disarray
Hate cult
We are the unending flame
Of the Hate cult
We are forever here
A group of indignant souls
Assemble in the smoke filled hall
And you find yourself in the centre
Of the vicious void
Exploding noise sets them free
And this growing circle comes crashing down
Flying around those free hand punches
And you find yourself involved
Now you are a part of the hate cult
Now you are a pride of the hate cult
You are a part of the hate cult
You are a pride of the hate cult
You are a part of the hate cult
