Your body is what I seek to live
Damnation of your soul
Possessed by the demon God
Black forces I hold
Hell is where I shall tread
Infernal hole
Symbol of impurity
Forever I will roam
I in you
Till the day you burn
Demoniac energy
Rots your soul
Evil impels through your veins
Consume Yourself
Lashes of sins bleeding black
Unholy realm
I in you
Till the day you burn
Demoniac Energy
Rots your soul
Watch the head turn
Watch my soul burn
This sow is mine
Burning smell at 3am
The witching hour is upon you
Your visions fade as putrid vile
The Touch of his hand wringing you
Belial
Legion
Nero
Lucifer's in you
Wretched smiles and tears of blood
Insides now rot in His unholy realm
Exorcist and priests alike
Have laid down their souls
God stands as witness tonight
The Adversary rules
I in you
Till the day you burn
Demoniac energy
Rots your soul
