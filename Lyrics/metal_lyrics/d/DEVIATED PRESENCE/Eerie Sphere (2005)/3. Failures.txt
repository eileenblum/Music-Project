arrival at the wrong place,
incidental manipulations,
reasonless undeliberate deeds,
torn connections, unused opportunities.

the ways can't be ungone,
me following the plan.
decisions can't be undone
turn-offs, shattered illusions

the failures i have seen corrupt my structure-of-life-machine
there is nothing right in where i reached this night
left behind by progress of life
desolate
past reflected in my eyes

exhausted from the struggle
against what's closing in on me
against the walls that block my way
against what i have seen

motivation's almost gone, the will to defend what makes me live.
hate remains, a crippling frenzy unleashed by lack of construction

smash reality!
destroy this empty futile realm!

the failures i have seen corrupt my structure-of-life-machine
there is nothing right in where i reached this night
left behind by progress of life
desolate
past reflected in my eyes

grip is lost
time winds away
drifting apart
nauseated by recognition

the failures i have seen corrupt my structure-of-life-machine
there is nothing right in where i reached this night
left behind by progress of life
desolate
past reflected in my eyes

destinations fade
