lost all the way
torn apart by demands
restless my fight
not to fall
while probably I'm
already down

when substance controls my reality
it's my hope that dies
when everything's wrong
it's hope that makes me try
when things catch up with me
it's hope that fuels my soul
to feel panic and run

it's all the grief
i've collected that
feeds my thoughts
the path of pain
prison of hopes
it's all the same
unperspective road

running through the forests of my life
floating on forgotten memories
it is hunting me again
takes my breath, swallows any sound

it's running through the undergrowth
but muted are my cries
still catching up with me
never can i outrun this part of me

while time takes its toll
nothing changes anyway
this episode will go past
as it all does

all these thoughts of a wasted life
all these memories in my head
all this pain now coming back

and these echos in my ears
(if I cannot wake up...)
lost time we can't repair
(...I might as well...)
this all now fades away
(...sleep forever)
when hope leaves life and death's the same

when substance controls my reality
it's my hope that dies
when everything's wrong
it's hope that makes me try
when things catch up with me
it's hope that fuels my soul
to feel panic and run

running through the forests of my life
floating on forgotten memories
it is hunting me again
takes my breath, swallows any sound
