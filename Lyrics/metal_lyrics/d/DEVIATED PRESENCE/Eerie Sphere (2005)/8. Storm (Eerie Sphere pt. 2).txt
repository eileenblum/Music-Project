calm in my mind, at last, only for some moments,
admiring the elements raging around me
the rain is heavy, turns the nocturnal world to hazy dark grey
wind lashes the scenery around my small
protective shell
the storm makes driving a flight
contentment comes as death seems present in wrathful nature

stormy days, huge projection of the turmoil inside my head
clean the earth of the violating order
and ease my soul

travelling home through purified air,
street signs shining plainly
like these thoughts arising in isolation.

parts of circle
exploding in life i was
when trying to rebuild the ruins.
inundated they would be, first panical hyperactivity now gone
life has been drawn out and replaced connections fade as hope does
leaving me exposed

no air to call for help left
proceed in functions
past is stronger than before
emptiness and pain

distorted scenes, pictures from the past
flashing in a new surge of the storm.
rage arises, the calm is gone

stormy days, huge projection of the turmoil inside my head
clean the earth of the violating order
and ease my soul

crawling towards a light that may crumble every second
the circle closes again thinner than any time before
cognition grown to a higher level of understanding a small part
one more circle to show
futility

time has grown old, sinister dreadful thoughts,
awful conflict between loathing and compassion.

ready for seclusion, the highway sounds distantly through frozen air.
they all pass, i have to stay. the journey's end should not have come
