The dreams have gone
wake up and start again all over and over
return to the sorrow of life
bear the grief tormenting you
everytime again start a new meaningless dream

disappointment is the consequence of all hope,
drown the tears along with yourself,
the sorrow will return for another strike
restart, cut the roots, break it all over,
just to feel the same disgrace again

the perception must have changed or circles will lead to death.
without grasp there's uncontrolled movement to chaos.
converting depression to wrath which is carried out to the world beyond
my reality, defending.

disappointment is the consequence of all hope,
drown the tears along with yourself,
the sorrow will return for another strike
restart, cut the roots, break it all over,
just to feel the same disgrace again

new dawn looks at me from the mirror,
the beautiful morning outside seems to say "forget the strain"
the windows cover the thoughts of the long lost past,
the ways of fate that have served their purpose
The gain of discovery after eradication fades.

disappointment is the consequence of all hope,
drown the tears along with yourself,
the sorrow will return for another strike
restart, cut the roots, break it all over,
just to feel the same disgrace again

so continue and leave the pain in the shades of progressing time,
while memories although fading remain and it all returns.
speed up life to outrun the self.
