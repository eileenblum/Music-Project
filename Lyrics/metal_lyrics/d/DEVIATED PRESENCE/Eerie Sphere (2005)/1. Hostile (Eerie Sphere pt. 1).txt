leaving one world
to find myself in another one even worse
surreal places in mental disease
self-inflicted torture

eerie inner sphere
misanthropic rage,
extinguish unknowing foul flesh

the trees wave in silent breeze
-mankind lost its horror here
nondestructive life invites to settle down
gather strength to face my fate

reflect the chaos, flee into isolation
fallen into dreams i'm free

to unleash my feelings from oppression
revenge on random exponents of human life
cutting a victim in surprise

scream
to drown out all your lies
bleed
as all my wounds
suffer
every pain that you have caused
die
as my hopes have died

sudden cheerfulness interludes the terror, throws me back
into the human torture chamber
irrationality, unharmonic ways of interaction
poison life on earth

the trees wave in silent breeze
-mankind lost its horror here
nondestructive life invites to settle down,
gather strength to face my fate

one stab in the back to make me
fall, the wave breaks
maelstroms tear my remains
to sinking pieces
life leaves me trailing
planing the decline

sunshine over the sorrow,
one of the fallen to live in ashes
with bloodthirsty phantasies,
strengthened in growing hostility

eerie inner sphere
misanthropic rage,
extinguish unknowing foul flesh

the trees wave in silent breeze
-mankind lost its horror here
nondestructive life invites to settle down,
gather strength to face my fate
