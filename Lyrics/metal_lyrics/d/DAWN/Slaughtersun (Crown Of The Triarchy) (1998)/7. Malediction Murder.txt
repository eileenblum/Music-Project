Who is this, trapped inside of me?
An unfamiliar, violent breed
Raping innocens, vestal mutilation
Razor seduction, slicing devastation

My body twist and turn from the agony
My lungs scream as the air is drained
And with the scars as my witness
My armes are maimed

Carnal betrayal, flesh abuse
Bloodloss... And my mindÂ´s confused
Torn between decisions
Made between incisions

Malediction murder
Suicidal law
Afflictions choir
I draw the shortest straw

But suddenly I came to clarity
About the black beast inside of me
Contored through submission
It took life to a higher position

I've felt the black light
Shining with strongest might
Guiding to the homicidal paths
And to unleash ungodly wrath

I've seen the black light
Blinding with strongest might
Showing me the homicidal way
As I slowly become its slave

...The Price All Must Pay

There must be no mercy for the
insignificant and weak
It's no tragedy that all this misery must
be cleansed through me

Malediction murder
Homicidal law
Afflictions choir
You'll draw the shortest straw

Malediction murder
Genocidal law
Afflictions choir
Man will draw the shortest straw

When it all crashes down
Death is triumphant and wears its crown
And my work is done
Suicidal law... Yet I have won
