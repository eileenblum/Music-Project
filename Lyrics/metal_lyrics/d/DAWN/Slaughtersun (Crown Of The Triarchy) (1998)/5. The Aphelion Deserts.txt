Black - Void
Culmination point
Where solar sons decline
Deserting thrones of stellar winds
divine

Dusk - Dawn
Twilight aureates
Balance breeds hostility
Contention will throw wide its gate

Hunt - Slay
Dedicated rape
Internal revelries errupt
Fornicating violence spread its drape

Mind - Soul
The universe reflects
Blackness absolution aches
Second sight the spirits now awakes

Sleep - Dream
Somnolent mirage
Enigmatic weavers speak
Chanting from the reveries I seek

Truth - Lie
True perception, false
Dimension vails reside
While new illusions now abide

Stride!
I greet the vultures of the horizon
The skyline of my very soul
For they enmantle all of creation
with the might that they extol

They flock to feast on my cadaver
to sever flesh and drain my heart
Unbound celestial assassins
Out from the umbra they depart

Conjunction standstill reigns supreme
Time is non-existent
No past to justify the future
The Aphelion Deserts

A chaos born from solar winds
For these storms are known to me
The stars thirst for darkness
The Aphelion Deserts

This, the foremost surge where catharsis thrives
Hatred fules the fires unforgiving
While blessings rain from ebon floods
Streaming from the apogee
The zest and source of vagrant wrath and memories
Without repenting gesture

Yonder suns deteriorate
Zenith repose
Contours move into nothingness
The empty comes to life
Finale without end

Love - Hate
Undivided force
A spear which penetrates
Leaving scarred the soul it violates

Lust - Pain
Devilry allure
Poetic universal tongue
The voice that left my dirge unsung

War - Strife
Battleblood in rage
Spiteful vengeance rides
The nightfall of our tender age

Life - Death
Circle come close
Recesses congregate
Lightlessness is what theyÂ´ll procreate

I join the vutures of my horizon
The skyline black is now my own
This firmament devies all reason
I'm midst the swarm yet all alone

This flock of fiends know no tomorrow
And yesterday has fled my view
Evolution laws crawl backwards
Out of the umbra we now spew
