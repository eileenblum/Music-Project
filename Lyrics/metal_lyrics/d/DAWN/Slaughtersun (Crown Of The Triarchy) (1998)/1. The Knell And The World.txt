Trust the black inside and suffocate the light in me

Throw the stones that kills the truth
Deception must be absolute

Rape the mind that will not die
Its sharpest throes must multiply

Dementia unresisted
Psycosis of the mind
Generation X termination
The blind leading the blind
Towards the end of the earth

Sweat cyanide seduction
Grown numb from the poison
That guides mankind beyond all
hopes of rebirth

Tear further into violence
And send forth the blade that
slaughter each cell

Stillbirth redemption
Sterility dances to the rapturous
sound of the knell

Let fevers rage and ravage
The deluded minds of all
Surrender to atrocity
And yeild by our fall
Stigmata children
Malady spawn
Downward resolution
The coming of dawn

Sacrilege sanctity
Pestilent seat
Dominion emerging
A world at their feet

Infidel armies
Viral release
Consensual redeemers
Penitence of disease

Weavers of famine
Starvation made whole
Their sepulchres spreading
Fulfilling their role
Sickness overcomes us
Past plagues ressurect

Generation X termination
The blind leading the blind
Towards the end of the earth

Sweat cyanide seduction
Grown numb from the poison
That guides mankind beyond all
hopes of rebirth

Let firestorms rend their emerald cloakes
Over a world that judgement provokes
Assailing retribution
The end of the line
Prosperity goes under hatred divine

Like bloody waves on shores alight
A devil soils with black What's white
And as he treads to sow his sead

He rides the earth of its
scavanger breed

The seas in rising tidal flow
Its liquid curse on us bestow
A killing force within us hide
Breeding wrath
World suicide

Generation X termination
The blind leading the blind
Towards the end of the earth

Sweat cyanide seduction
Grown numb from the poison
That guides mankind beyond all
hopes of rebirth

Tear further into violence
And send forth the blade that
slaughter each cell

Stillbirth redemption
Sterility dances to the rapturous
sound of the knell
