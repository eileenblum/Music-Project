A downward spiral of misery, pain and defeat
A life in ruins. Promises made. But only deceit.
Face down. Always spat on, hated, despised
Pure human waste
No hope... No future

The claws of depravity sinks deeper
as you're pushed from society
The searh for "a life" is no longer an option
Backs turned. Friends forget
Now place your final bet

Please cross my path and feel my wrath
Deserving victim, now feel the aftermath
Now meet youre doom
...Here is your tomb

Don't ask why
Why do I critizise?
You're all that I despise
Now see the rage in my eyes

I am your judge
this is your trial, no sense in denial

I am your judge
youre sentence is death
Inhale the led on your vay last breath

Your executioner, that is I
Say your prayers... now you die

Don't ask why
Why do I critizise?
You're all that I despise
Now see the rage in my eyes

I wish you could live through me
And feel the way I feel
And daily confront your fears
Never shed a single tear
It's always been like this

The world fears my labour
None understands (that) IÂ´ve done them a favour
If I could - mass genocide
None spared - None left alive
But it's all to far away
