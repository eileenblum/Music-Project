An easy target for the soulassassin
The soulless, remorseless, everlasting
Hunting for the next tender pray
Leaving dead the soul it rapes

Drained of hope, drained of life
Searching for the reason of lightÂ´s demise
Seeking a reason to live on
Now when lifelust is all gone

Face to face with my own death
Reflecting fear on my very breath
Chanting the relief in dying
In which IÂ´m not denying

Pointing its finger at my misery
Mocking my destiny
Selling the easy way out
Beyond all questionable doubt

Another victim for the soulassassin?
The soulless, coldblooded, everlasting
Am I the next tender pray?
I won't let my soul be raped!

I am no longer weak
My soul grows stronger
Now I'm the coldblooded
And with hate I'm flooded

I am no longer weak
Now I'm remorseless
The strongest and soulless

Reaping has begun!
No mercy as I strike down and crush the world!
