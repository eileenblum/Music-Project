[Originally performed by Infernal Majesty]

Incantations, spoken at the stroke of midnight,
exhume their bodies from their timeless slumber
Soulless participants in this unholy ritual,
the dead crawl from their earthen prisons
Bodies decayed beyond recognition, they amass,
prepare nightmares from the darkest recess of your imagination
Tormented by lusty unquenchable thirst for blood
they are driven on loosed of the shackles
and free of the grave their vengeance knows no bounds
Raging hunger pierces the black, in the flicker of their morbid gaze
Creatures of evil spawned and spewn from the depths of hell
Moaning with desire for the flesh of the unsuspecting victims of their attack
wanton destruction burns in their hearts as they enter the land of the living

Rise frenzied lust for flesh.
Your blood seeps through my chest
You are the living dead.
Storming god's planet earth
Shambling gait downcast eyes retrogress from the grave
Empithely spewing pus from their lifeless veins
Decayed legions cast from Hades rotting lungs exposed
Maggots feed and the smell of death overcomes and cripples all
Lifeless emissaries of evil crazed
by the pleasure of their vile inhumanities
Wretched outcasts of the underworld
condemned to roam the earth and kill all that lives...

They will march for satan-demons-guardians of the damned
Vile-haunting-soulless creatures, satan's-legions of the dead
They will march for satan-demons-guardians of the damned
Vile-haunting-soulless creatures, satan's-legions of the dead
They will march for satan-demons-guardians of the damned
Vile-haunting-soulless creatures, satan's-legions of the dead
The darkest day of horror the world has ever known!
