Ran out of time
Forcing me down
Deep into pain

Uncontrolled suffering
Hysteria - Crying
No blood in my veins

Left here alone
Hear my screams of torment
I'm in pain
Consumed with agony
I live in vain
Rosered as tears cut my face
...Washed Away...

Poison injection
Body infection
Death reflection
Life rejection

My world turns black
Cursed by the shadows

Poison injection
Body infection
Death reflection
Life rejection

...Fear... Crying... Screaming...
...Pain... Agony... Anguish...
...Torment... Suffering...
...Black... Hate...
...Death...
