Icarus, your presence imperceptible
Your wings abandoned, cynically, so desperately undone
My son, my blood, I can't recognize you anymore
What made you frightened? What changed you whole?
Delightful winds that could take us all away from here
Don't blow out the mist around
Don't make the air more clear
Delightful winds don't make the sky more clear

Mist that separated us
That covers the edge that doesn't allow us to fly
Without a right for my perilous try
If I deserved it I would find the way to die

Icarus, what happened there my son?
Your life incomplete, morbidly, so desperately undone
I can hardly recognize the flesh spread right before me
What made you soar so high? Why did you rush decisions?
Delightful wind carried you up there under the sky
Blew out the mist and lifted you amazed in awe and brightness
My son, you were too close and too fast
Too eager to know the heavy truth that threw you down
Mist that separated us
That covers the edge that doesn't allow us to fly
Am I held captive for the rest of time?
What if the mist's a product of deluded mind?
Water makes things heavier
Heat will melt your wings
Nothing's what you'll ever learn
With eyes blindfolded facing sky in fear

Mist that separated us, that separated us
The edge that doesn't allow us to fly
