A phantom that wanders and haunts, gently absorbing the strength
Distaste of inhuman measures, yet bonded with awe
Monstrosity dressed in secrets and gestures, this knowledge embraced
Canvas is dripping with gray and delusion, the reason, it's dead
You had it coming for ages, you've brought this upon yourself
Degrading self-pity is what you deserve, come ruin and break
For god's sake, it's now or it's never, it's taking so long
Pressure determines the way the things work, home and what it means now
Cycle broken beyond repair, the ebbs of rejoice and flows of regret
Tearing apart the land of deception, the reason is dead, the reason is dead
You had it coming for ages, you've brought this upon yourself
Degrading self-pity is what you deserve, now ruin and break
I avoid what I already know
I avoid what I already know
I avoid what I already know
This void is all left to know
