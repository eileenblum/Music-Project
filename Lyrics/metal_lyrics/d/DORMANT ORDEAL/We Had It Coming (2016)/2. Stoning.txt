Why couldn't I find a verse about the mothers who
In front of the gates don't allow me to use my key and enter?
Far before I beheaded their firstborn my grave was dug
Now put my corpse to sleep

Give me a child and I'll give you a man
Able to form it, I'll mold it like clay
Give me your child, I will give you a man
With shapeless water I will pour your vase

Would you...? Would you drink the cup that I'm about to drink?
Would you do that for me?
As you have learned just give simple pray for those
Who stand against the heavy rain in a thin and filthy coat

Give me a child and I'll give you a man
Able to form it, I'll mold it like clay
Give me your child, I will give you a man
With shapeless water I will pour your vase

That's only one way road
No turning back at all
If you do not conquer self
You will be conquered by self

With stones on my neck and sourness in mouth
You could teach me the weight, the taste of this world
