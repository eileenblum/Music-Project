They're everywhere, they don't know yet they've seen it through
I must not be exposed, can never rest 'cause no one rests
In this day and age can't let myself be caught off guard like that
I look beyond the dimmest light, there's more conspiracy than truly meets the eye

Desensitized to every feeling ever known to men
Except for fear and caution and panic and paranoia
I walk into the shadows land
Where guilt continues and spans for aeons

Too obsessed to stop
I'll never get caught
Chain of consequence locks

Given up all the effort to concentrate on anything
Other than the aftermath of vanity
Footsteps, whispers wreck my ears
I step into a typhoon, cyclone, blast of persecution and insanity

Too obsessed to stop
I'll never get caught
Chain of consequences tightens around my neck
