Might be the borderline, the last time you ever hear from me
I can't risk to find out how much is more than I can take
It isn't real, the whole process, it's wearing me out
Starving myself works wonders, but it's the only life I have
Despair to get out before lies melt away
To get through before I'll understand why we keep to remember
What drives us insane
Locked inside a house set ablaze
Counting blisters I watch you from there and I wait, I wait
Back stab the shame
Then breathe, breathe, breathe the relief
Salt, salt bathe the wound
And scrape, scrape, scrape the fuck out of it
Whole world is going to change
Towards delusion we roam
Right where we stand
I can't stand the hoax
Whole world's going to change
I should have listened to you
Right where we stand
We are trapped for good
Months into years like centuries
Made of days spent in fire, a lesson of misery
To cope with regrets of destructive collapse
This place will always be the stronghold of lies
Back stab the shame
Then breathe, breathe, breathe the relief
Salt, salt bathe the wound
And scrape, scrape, scrape
'Cause it's the only life you have
