Whose name for echoes to carry
How glorious the sacrifice
Those flags couldn't care less for honor
These men don't know yet they're gone
Shotguns moan in the distance
So we know you arrived
Couldn't say we've been waiting
Couldn't help but invite
Battalions at the edge of frontier
Armed yet sweetly defenseless
Repressions assigned with no order
Until we decide
Until we decide to
Strike you down and your terrible mistake
Strike, into arms of destruction you rush, you rush
The disintegration, sad fall of all nations
Into arms of destruction you rush
"Day five. We're spineless. December the 4th to crawl, suiciders..."
Aggression suppressed
Warmongers turned pale
Watch the self-feeding beast with ten thousand mouths
Discord, dissent
Thousands of earthquakes
Made us great undertakers
Watched the life being born
Watched it growing old
No threat out there, for we are the keepers
Won't make through the night, won't make out alive
You won't make it to dawn that could point you the way out
We are the keepers, we run the sky
Dismembered chrome soldiers, neglected, withdrawn
Sleeping grounds, so very ours
Grounds so ours
The disintegration, sad fall of all nations
Into arms of destruction you rush, you rush
Strike you down, your terrible mistake
Strike, into arms of destruction you rush
