It's not a place for lightness
Blackness immersed it all
Shroud yourself in grimness
It perfectly fits your pale mouth
Just put out the candle
It's easier than feeding the fire
Don't let anybody find you

Abandon all hope who enter inferno
Who seek for blackness eternal

Tar â blood of the earth
Stench of rot growing for years
Touch up all remorse with that
So blissful is mind when painted black
Filthy is more genuine
So serious and so real
Like the world on the edge
No details, no taste

Abandon all hope who enter inferno
Ye who seek for filth eternal
Surrender and withdraw
Who seek for noise eternal
Abandon all hope
Abandon all
Abandon all

Silence means no control
Silence terrifies us most
Don't listen to those who claim to know better
Bring conscience up short

Wipe order out once and for all

Abandon all hope who enter inferno
Who seek for blackness eternal
Ye who bless unintelligence
Who seek for solace
