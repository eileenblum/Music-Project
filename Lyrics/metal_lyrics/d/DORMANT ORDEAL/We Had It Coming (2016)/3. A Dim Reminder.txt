I saw a monster, the lion up high
Spreading his mane, glowing with embers and flames
Raised his head above the clouds
So I behold a shallow, littleness of mine

If radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky
That would be--

Then I heard a thunder, a squeak of birds of prey
Revelation to all corners of this dormant world
A choir of those who burn
So I behold a mockery of all pitiful victors' songs

If radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky
That would be like the splendor of the mighty--

I am become death
I am become destroyer
The destroyer of worlds

I felt its blow, a hit of giant dragon claw
Knocking down to the knees, life ceases to exist
The view like a mirror, reflection of mine
Itâs not me anymore, itâs not me

I am become death
(The destroyer of...)
I am become destroyer
(I am become...)
The destroyer of worlds

If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once
That would be like splendor of the mighty, of the mighty one
For I am become death
I am become destroyer
The destroyer of worlds
