From among the clouds with no sound at all
I challenge the greatest fall
Earth's so beautiful
When only a light down below

â¦and no one to tell the right path from wrong
As long as I breathe I'll exhale all things wrong
The last hundred feet and this world is over
It's over

Cold water breaks into swollen lungs
Darkness engulfs me, devours me, absorbs
Ocean of creatures extends on my eyes
Still I will find the shore even beyond

I don't mind to be 
Expelled
from your heaven, but
I promise you
You'll never
Ever touch mine

Dive, dive into depths of this hell
To hunt for the beast
And from the depths it'll emerge 
To hunt for me
Fear... 
I have no fear, not anymore
Another day depends on my will
My home is here

I don't mind to be 
Expelled
from your heaven, but
I promise you
You'll never
Ever touch mine
