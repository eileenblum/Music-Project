Out of the woods
Walked into path of enlightenment
Entered the town of ideas
They breathe
The air none else can breathe

How bizarre!
Depths of earth no longer dark
Oracles, they're oracles, they're inerrant
Lions, come!
Reveal the lands unknown
Lions, come!

All that to behold is
What feeds these demons
Up the river flow
They climb but they'll fall
A king on his horse
Is nothing more than a pawn
Under armors of war
Souls naked, exposed

Lions, come!
Let them see how far we've come
Let them know
Lions, come!
Reveal the lands unknown
Lions, come!

No eyes can bear the sight
No man can prove his rights
Your race will never be worth
Our reign concludes, it rains, it pours...
