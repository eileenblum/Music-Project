There is no valley as deep
Where echo soothes or tears
There are no climbers as strong
To transform themselves into one
You can put them fingers into ears touching your eyes
But vibes of memory will crush them like a glass

You could break your nails, your fists, your teeth, your will, your legs, your arms 
And still would not manage to restrain from what's sensual

The sun had never lit our path
Our paths removed from bigger path
Our hearts never beat
The sun had never burnt our necks
Our feet had never felt the grass
Our thoughts never thought
My body does not know the focus of your gaze
My fingers had never soaked on you 

Imagine, we do not exist
Evaporated!
Somebody's wiped us off like letters on sand
Imagine, we do not exist
Evaporation!
The stick we have been written with never been
