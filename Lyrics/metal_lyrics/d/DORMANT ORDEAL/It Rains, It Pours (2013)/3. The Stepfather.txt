Boldly look to the sky to follow 
The path of the stars
The great introduction
To greater illusion
I fear
You figured them out
I know you'll figure them out
One day 
You'll know the rules
Which wheel drive

If I won't gouge your eyes out
Shall keep mine open wide
I dream I'm stabbed in back
By hand of my own child
I need to gouge your eyes out
To finally make it stop
For you - to realize
For whom those stars shine

Now with me repeat those hymns 
They'll tell you what to know
And don't you dare to sing this 
Verse you privily wrote on your own
I cry to see your eyes 
Wandering inside the mind
Wandering inside the mind
