Humanization, a maze of nations
Divided between mares, errors and axioms
Being as warranties of self-contained peace
Civilization, a maze of insanity

Lost, deprived with no way out...
Cypress cries loud
We've made a vengeful enemy...
We've gained scars
Lost, deprived with no way out...
Cypress cries loud
Maze...

All that creation, a maze of apprehension
Science is a god's imitation
With blind spectrum of fake happiness
A civilized maze of thoughtlessness

Lost, deprived with no way out
Cypress have always been crying loud
Lost! Deprived!
Cypress will never stop crying loud

Not loud enough to be heard
Not loud enough to be heard

Prepare for war against purity
Prepare for war against purity
Prepare for war against purity
