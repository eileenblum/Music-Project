So little I have to do
To play with your feelings
Enough to strangle the queen
Your honey has taste of doom
Tears wept over a principal
And you still believe you're more than animals

So little has to be done
To separate faces from smile
Enough to tear your homes down
And all you do - worshipping stones
Army of coffins, flags and bones
You still believe... more than animals

Despite you pretend to be blind 
For sunlight breaking the skyâ¦
Despite you pretend to be deaf for rain 
Drowning bird wailsâ¦

Don't need a hackamore or other lime
Force you to hide to force you to run
The elements are shepherds able to make
Abandoning joeys herd getting away

No culture so strong
That can survive me
In my game you won't see the dawn
I could blow off your nests as damn houses of cards
Have a drag with the smoke from just burned nesting site
And you'd still believe...
You're animals!

Despite you pretend to be blind 
For sunlight breaking the skyâ¦
Despite you pretend to be deaf for rain 
Drowning bird wailsâ¦
Despite you pretend to be blind 
For sunlight breaking the skyâ¦
Despite you pretend to be deaf I wonât let you forget your place
