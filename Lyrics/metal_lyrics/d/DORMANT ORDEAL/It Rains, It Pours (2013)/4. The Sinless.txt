Mouth that swallows guilt
Forgiveness symbolized
The shame, the sorrow
Hidden below the light
The sinless ones 
Who devour the innocent
A tongue that licks the wounds in
The act of ripping flesh

Heart that breathes the hatred
Pumps blood so gravely black
I am the trigger in that shotgun 
Pointed at your head
Loaded
With desire to exterminate 
Devour the innocence
The sinless erased

I can bleed myself to death
and stay there invisible, unseen
I can bleed myself to death
like I was destined to be forgotten
