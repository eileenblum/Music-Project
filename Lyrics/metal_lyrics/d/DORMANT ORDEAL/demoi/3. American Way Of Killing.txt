Do you know the best way for war
Perfect confrontation for sacred oil
Far away from you Far away from your family
Extermination on the other's territory

Destroyed builds Black window's holes
Remains of the bodies Soldiers like a dolls
Lie on the street Burning parts of cars
In front of the kinds Straight to their eyes

It's not your childhood
It's not your occupation
It's not you nightmare
It's you pure profit

Nobody can forget Own mother's death
If they know the murder Will want the revenge
So don't ask why They become the terrorists
What they have to lost Kill for a kill

It's their extermination
It's their damn
It's their holocaust
By your reigns

Since the years the same method of killing
The same way of earn. Method unites the problems
How they can... Even innocents
But remember always Who was this first

For them you're not better than terrorist
For them you're not better than Him

It's their damn
And I'm their scream
Why the whole shit of war
You give for the victims
