The strangling darkness I suffocate on it
My blind fingers Search for exit
Sickness thoughts Burn my brain
Possessed body In endless pain

I can't give you all what you want
I can't bear this pressure
I can't bear this situation
I can't take it with pleasure

Leave me alone...

In tiny tent In smallest room
In my defeated inside My horrible doom
I think I love you I can't bear this game
My fears are stronger I'm running away

From love to fear From fear to pain
From pain to fall From fall to hate
