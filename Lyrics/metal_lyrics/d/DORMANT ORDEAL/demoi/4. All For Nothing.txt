You are slipping in pretty dream
You're delicious in sweet sins
You don't know yet unfortunately
This sweet dream will be you nightmare

Money career deal or street sluts
Be careful you'll wake up with hand in chamber pot

The great ambitions The biggest plans
Unreal visions first before all
When you think about future this what you have
is going down quickly out of your sense

You are an idiot? Putting on the scales
all your reaches with uncertain step
It is a madness living in yourself-lie
In dormant ordeal you're going to die
