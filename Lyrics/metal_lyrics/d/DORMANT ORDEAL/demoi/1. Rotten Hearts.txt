We want to be loved
We seek to be kind
We try to make earth-paradise

But still hurts
We still make tears
The endless ordeal in lies

Just we can't love
This worths are lost
But our hearts are rotten

Don't touch the impossible
We try the impossible

We talk about change
We talk about needs
In moment of higher impression
We wonted to live
Just we can do it
Momentary change of obsession

Rotten...
