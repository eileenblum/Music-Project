Lights out Mind is opened
Something is vibrating in space
In quietness fear can screaming louder
blowing out of your head
Shakings on skin Tears on shutters
The body, hate is bunging
The words and thoughts are gashing reality
Irrational twisted reasoning

Give me only the truth or lie
Give me only the love or hate
Give me only the light or shadow
Give me only nihilism or faith

Incomprehensible anger 
made by the voices and sounds
Bafflegab of own insanity
Let your blood see the sun
Love teaches you a pain
in the endless disillusionment
Maybe If it has never been
what is this punishment?

The truth or lie
The love or hate
The light or shadow
Nihilism or faith

Blood is flowing faster
Eyes are inexact looking
Nails are hurting hands
Over the scope convulsing
Own war of mind and heart
It is screaming you're alone
Thoughts and deceptive feelings
Dormant ordeal in own home
