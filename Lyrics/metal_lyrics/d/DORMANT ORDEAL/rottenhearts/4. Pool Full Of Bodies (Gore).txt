Gott... Mit... Uns...

We went down to the dark cellar
In the sloping light
from high situated windows
dead persons were lying as yesterday
Their bodies, nude, oatmeal, young, 
in a perfect condition like the tough statues
despite of waiting here for months
for a moment to be unwanted

It is not some fucking gore
It is the darkness of history
It is the human imagination
It is not our sick aberration

Lying, like in sarcophagus
in the concrete long pools
without blanket, ones on anothers
without a funeral's ritual
Dead's cut as evenly as from stone
In your holocaust they trust
One of them with tatuated sentence
of futile faith: God with us
Gott... Mit... Uns...

Two tubs with shaved heads
cut from those bodies
Human faces like a spilled potatoes
yellowed and smooth such preserved
with half-closed unnamed eyes
Brains witch know your hate
