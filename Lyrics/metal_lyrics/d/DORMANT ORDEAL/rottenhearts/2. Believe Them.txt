Do you believe these lousy smiles
linked by the screen into your brain
They give you own hands and follow to dreams
to still your hope and sell yourself

They show you your thirsts
They say almost it's your
If you send us your naivety
in short message by mobile phone

Do you believe these masses of folding stuff
These king's faces spotted by countless crimes
If they can win So you can either
Over your eyes flashes of headlights

Six numbers six jams six vouchers
Your future is written in balls
You believe power of daft questions
Fortune can change the colors of life

Do you believe these expensive suits
Do you believe these shaved mugs
Do you believe these layers of lies
Stay in your mares If you only want
