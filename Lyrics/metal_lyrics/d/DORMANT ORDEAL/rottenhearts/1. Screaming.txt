I spit...
I spit this rotten liquid
stinks by your agonizing words
It's burning me and calling to scream
to dump it from inside to not be a corpse

I'm screaming ' cause it makes me free
I want to dump off lies inside of me
I'm vomiting I'm running away
This painful shit you feed me everyday

I vomit...
I vomit this stinky mustiness
You show me your deeds the lousy acts
even when I close my eyes
It pursues me still in void I stuck

I'm screaming ' cause it makes me free
I want to dump off thoughts inside of me
I'm vomiting I'm running away
This painful shit you feed me everyday

I scream off...
I scream off this destructive hate
It egresses with sweat and dribble over my skin
It is like a septic disease
breeding yourself inside of me...
