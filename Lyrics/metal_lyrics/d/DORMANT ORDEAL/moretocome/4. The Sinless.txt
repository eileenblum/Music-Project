Mouth that swallows guilt
Forgiveness symbolized
The shame, the sorrow,
Hidden below the light
The sinless ones
Who devour the innocent
Tongue that licks the wound in
The act of ripping flesh

Here's to sheep among the wolves
Here lies the sin of living

Heart that breathes the hatred
Pumps blood so gravely black
I am the trigger in this
Shotgun pointed at your head
Loaded
With desire to exterminate
Devour the innocent
The sinless erased

I can bleed myself to death
Stay there invisible, unseen
I can bleed myself to death
Like I was destined to forget

Here's to sheep among the wolves

I can bleed myself to death
Stay invisible, unseen

I can bleed myself to death
Stay there invisible, unseen
