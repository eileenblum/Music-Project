Who made me your thing?
My son you'd imprisoned me
I had my innocence and You
Infected me
With leprosy of sullage plowed
with bomb's plough
Sowed by goobers of chimneys
My body's old
And slack

Flames
Over your settlement
Draft for your cattle flood for your streets
My voice is gale
Calamity's my fury

I had to be your mother
Feeding and watering your
Nation, You used to bath your child
In my blood you'd mixed
With stale of your pride
Your deluge recollection
Remains of sad times
And now you fish out drowned men

Storm for your fleet
Locust over harvest
Famine over progeny
My scream is gale
Calamity is my rage

And You think I am your friend
You'd given me a sword
Pulling my soul with missiles
Squeeze into fumes and smog
You cut off my lungs, My green burn out
Into ash
Choked by your fumes, Strangled with no breeze
You penetrate my body as a parasite

My scream is gale
Calamity's my hate
