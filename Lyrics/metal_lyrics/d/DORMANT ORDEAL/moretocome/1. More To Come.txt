Collapsing into pieces
Foundation made of glass
With inhuman precision
Wiped into ashes and dusts
Transition
To another form
From god into an enemy
Resurrecting the name of hidden force 
That's world-wide known

What do you know about tragedy?!
What do you learn by misery?!
Which way you're gonna take from here?!
Which way you're gonna choose? 

What do you know about tragedy?!
What do you learn by misery?!
Which way you're gonna take from here?!

Nations are falling down
Elation
Wind blows towards mankind
Replacing lies with life

You pray for rain and drown
You pray for rain and drown
You won't be ready when it comes 

I'll smash you like a fly
Like I smashed the pride of these forgotten empires
I'll smash you like a fly
Like I smashed the pride of these who didn't take a bow

Rise your heads
Watch the burning glow above
Weapons of mass destruction 
Raindrops compared to me
I've seen the dawn of men
I'm here to witness dusk
To err is human 
To erase - divine
