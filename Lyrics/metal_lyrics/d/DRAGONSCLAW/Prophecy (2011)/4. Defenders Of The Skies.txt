Launch the attack, warfare burns the open skies,
Gasoline death machines and men prepared to die,
As we lift off high above the ground
From below, the air-raid siren calls,
fire-watchers wait tonight as burning shrapnel falls

Hide in shadows
Watch for anything that makes a sound
This burning hellfire
descends upon the ground
Under blackened skies
By the light of the moon
we are destined for victory or doom

Never be numbers
Under blackened skies
Never be shadows wearing a disguise,
They are defenders
and they don't live in fear
they stand and fight as the enemy draws near

We choose our side and loyalties
We defend what belongs to us
We think not of the enemies
As we grind them into dust
We are the homeland forces
We do what must be done
We are few in number
Living and dying by the gun
