It seemed like a good idea at the time
A place no one could find
On the edge of town
No one could hear a sound

Almost like a hospital
But evil minds lurked within
conducting experiments
An exercise in sin

Too much power, unchallenged control
Too much evil and a blackened soul
Like in 1983... Cult like mentality

Are you ready to fight for your life
are you ready to flee the dark
what's happening here is no dream
but a cold reality yeah
