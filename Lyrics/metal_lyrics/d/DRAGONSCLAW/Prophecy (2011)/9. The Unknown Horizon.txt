Artificial starlight is dancing in the skies
falling from the heavens
the night is their disguise
they will walk among us
hidden deep within the crowd
they infiltrate and communicate
Their orders from the clouds

The blind and huddled masses-
make for easy prey
never would they dream that their end
would come today

Some would form militias
while others went to ground
scattering like roaches
In some abandoned town
nothing could prepare us
for what we had to lose
the scourge is all around us
devouring what they choose

With perfect cold indifference
their armys raged and fought
the terror of the enemy
clouded every thought

The fires of humanity
arc cinders fading out
those who never cared to pray
were suddenly devoute

No time for warning
the weak will be enslaved
another frantic exodus
and no one can be saved
Their overwhelming power
their methods have evolved
their strength is not in numbers
but tactical resolve
