Waiting for the night to fall
feeling only hunger
searching for a victim for the nightly kill
Only a shadow in the night
No one can see the evil...
that lurks behind every step they take

The darkness within
Lives in the shadow zone
No place to run
You're trapped all alone

(Fear, Death, Hate,)
Darkness within
(Fear, Death, Hate)

Running through the streets alone
he is drawing near
Right there behind you
Watching from high above
As the sun goes down
this creature controls you

The darkness within
Lives in the shadow zone
No place to run
You're trapped all alone

No place to run
(Fear, Death, Hate)
No way out
(Fear, Death, Hate)

The darkness within
Lives in the shadow zone
No place to run
You're trapped all alone
