No one here gets out alive
but no one lives in fear
of the sounds the way of life
the end that's drawing near

Rising Power Screaming sound
Constant chaos raining down

You're not coming back from here
This is where you stay
Now that you have made the choice
you do things our way

Rising Power Screaming sound
Constant chaos raining down
This is the chance prepare to fight
(Fight)
take no prisoners this is our life

As you count the dead
and see the suffering
no illusions now
your final day is here

Rising Power Screaming sound
Constant chaos raining down
This is the chance prepare to fight
(Fight)
take no prisoners this is our life
