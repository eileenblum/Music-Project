Like an angel cast from heaven
Like a demon takes to flight
feel the fury of the black top
as I speed across the night

Feel the howling of the pistons
like a banshee cast from hell
as I'm cutting through the night (It bleeds)
play the hand that I've been dealt.

I see the evil out to get me
I won't give it half a chance
my burning soul will set the night aflame
like the devil's fiery dance

Can't stop me
Can't take me
Won't ever slow me down
Can't beat me
Won't defeat me
On this battle ground
