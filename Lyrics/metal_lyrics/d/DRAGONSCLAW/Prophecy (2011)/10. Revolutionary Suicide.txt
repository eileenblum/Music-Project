In the cold light of morning
In some forsaken field
900 soles abandon
in the name of one ideal
Like some misguided prophet
A sheppard who chose to lead
Was this an act of protest
Or another darker deed

Oh greater one then us
Show us the way
path of no return ready to self destruct
obey your command
we are the lost
On the road straight to hell

Do the walls have eyes
Is the night alive
Is darkness just a shadow on the wall
was it easy to give up
was the power just too much
a mastermind in control of you

Falling and rising and
twisting and turning
crying and screaming and
dying and bleeding

Now feeling no pain
Now, nothing remains

What motivates more than the promise
Is the promise of the end
the weak will be lead
into the darkness they are fed
No turning back when you've come this far
They will take your soul
and will twist your mind
and leave you where you are
