No place to hide
nowhere for you to run
only the end
waits for your life of constant lies
The time has come
For you to be found
guilty for your evil
time to be judged accordingly

Now no one cares
Take advantage of the weak
live off the suffering
of the fools your twisted truth
Distorted reality
You blindfolded all of them
No fear or conscience
An out-cast you stand alone

Stand before him
Life will be judged
Stand before him
Life through Anubis eyes
