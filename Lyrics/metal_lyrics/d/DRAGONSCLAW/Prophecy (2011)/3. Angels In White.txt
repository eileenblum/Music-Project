Devils in white, heaven in black
Cross yourself now and never look back
Enter the gates of your biggest fear
Give praise to nothing as you enter here

This is the end of all you know
This is where your dreams come to die.

There are no soul protectors
There are no angels in white
As they pound on your soul
Killing your will to fight
And there will be no defenders
There will be nothing but death?
Breathing the poison gasses
As you die with the rest

The weight on your body to take another breath
Every moment a curse that fights your will of death?
Were you the answer? Or the question too?
Who is the "one" when two "ones" equal two?

Human perseverance a dangerous thing
You just want out to never feel another thing

Indoctrination, isolation the cult of the one percent
Termination and extermination this machine must be fed
