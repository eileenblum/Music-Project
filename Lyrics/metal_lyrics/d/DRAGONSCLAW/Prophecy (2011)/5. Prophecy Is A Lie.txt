Who are you to know the end?
And why do you speak to us of death?
Do you believe there is a god?
And has he told you of his plan?

Is all that you see
Part of the Divine?
Is it hell for eternity?
Is it a way to twist the lie?
Is the end what you foresee?

Preaching death unto the earth
Armageddon drawing near
Think you know what is to come
Those that listen live in fear

Truth fear?
The prophecy is only lies?
Truth fear?
You're a savior in disguise?
Truth fear?
Don't believe the lies they bring
Truth fear?
Gain your power from within
