[Words: Makinen, Music: Keranen]

Shadow lies bloodless on the hill
Frozen in the night of forgiven
Ceased to exist, in one life
As only the memory that remains

In the woods, where's eternity?
I sit in the valley of greed and daylight
Love to the stars and my Elven-dryad
My own savior, angel of night, my betrothed

For aeons I was with you, my friends
Amongst the mortals in their dreams
Burned out in the one star's end
Among enlightened thousands shining

[Chorus:]
Gazing from the sky, night in my eyes
As Elf I watch you, in my memories
So bright, doomed to die in starlight
Eternally I walk in the twilight

And bright are the stars that smile on me
And great is the joy I had with you
And remember me as the wolf that stares
With love, in the forest of dreams

With yellow eyes, all wise with color of Grey
So many times I was a stranger with you

Just a tiny little shadow that frightened
All days and nights, ran away in the rain

Where the trees are living and flowers are blue
I dream of the stars and my angel with me
