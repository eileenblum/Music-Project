[Words: Orjatsalo, Keranen, Music: Keranen]

As my mind flows by
It wanders through the time
Darkness hides the light of day
And time goes by
It reaches shrouded mind
Shadows veil this unsound smile

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shadows hide the light
Bleakness fills my mind
I'll rise on my wings tonight

[Chorus:]
With the wind I fly at the nightly sky
I ride the lightning of the storm
I'm the hero of the tales
The son of thunder from the forgotten dales
This dreamland will be mine
Refuge from Reality

Dreaming's my way
To another better place
The door to my dreamtale
The tale never ends
Stories reaching through the time
Come with us and fly to the dark

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shadows hide the light
Bleakness fills my mind
I'll rise on my wings tonight

[Chorus:]
With the wind I fly at the nightly sky
I ride the lightning of the storm
I'm the hero of the tales
The son of thunder from the forgotten dales
This dreamland will be mine
Refuge from Reality
