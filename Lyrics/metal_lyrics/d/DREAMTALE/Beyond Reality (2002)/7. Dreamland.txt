[Words: Orjatsalo, Music: Orjatsalo]

Come with me my friend
You'll see a place beyond reality
Fly into the night with me
Together through eternity

Earth they call this place they live
Look (at) the mountains, oceans so deep
Hatred, fear, intolerance
Peace will never have a chance

School too hard for man to learn
Were those lessons from the past
Time will show 'em answers true
One day they will learn to

[Chorus]
Fly with me toward the morning light
You will see what lies beyond the night
Place so real, where is no fear
No need to shed any tears

[Solo]

[Repeat Chorus]
