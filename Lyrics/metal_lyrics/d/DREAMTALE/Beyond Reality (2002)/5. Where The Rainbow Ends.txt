[Words: Keranen, Music: Keranen]

In my dream I was in a valley
By waters clear as ice
Trees and mountains that surround me
Nothing so beautiful have I ever seen
Can a place like this these days still exist?
A place people haven't destroyed yet
There's no pollution, just fresh air
There are no men who wouldn't care
This is the paradise where I want to stay
Where no one else can find a way

Where the Rainbow Ends
There I go, there I mend
There's the land of the free
There's the place where I want to be
There I go - Where the Rainbow Ends

Mystery of this place keeps fascinating me
It preoccupies my mind, time after time
When I look at the sky and I see birds fly
It's a play at my theatre
Into this dreamland I always come back
Where my life goes on in the same, safe track
Take my hand and come with me
I'll show you the place you've never been
This is the paradise where I want to stay
Where no one else can find the way

Where the Rainbow Ends
There I go, there I mend
There's the land of the free
There's the place where I want to be
There I go - Where the Rainbow Ends

[Solo]

[Chorus]
