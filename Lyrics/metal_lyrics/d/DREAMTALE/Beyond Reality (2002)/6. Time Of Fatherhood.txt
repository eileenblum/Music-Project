[Words: Keranen, Music: Keranen]

I'm watching the nightly sky
Like looking for answers from there
How am I going to say goodbye?
To you, the only one I care
Who knows what is my destiny?
Why (do) I have to escape my feelings?
And run with so much pain inside of me
Can I survive and forget everything that I feel?
Can I cover myself up in a veil of steel?

For no reason at all
I deny my feelings
I escape my life

I picture your face in my head
It makes me lose my mind
And all the feelings that I've thought dead
Wake alive
Now when years have passed from that night
When I fled and left you alone
Carrying new life by your inside
How have you got on, is everything all right?
These thousands of thoughts in my mind
Without answers at all

[Chorus:]
Time of Fatherhood
Then too much for me
I snuck out of your life, like a thief
Forgive me, no escaping anymore
Give me new chance to live
