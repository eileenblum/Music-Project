[Words: Orjatsalo, Music: Orjatsalo, Keranen]

Light's fading, night is calling
Covering the worries of day
Wind whispers, leaves are falling
Slowly light fades, comes to shade

Following the path to a silent vale
Whispers of wind call me to stay

Nightfall is weaving its spell
Darkness hides the land within its shell
Twilight lights my way as I flow
Realms beyond imagination I go

Blinded by time,
Of the years that have passed by
Left to astray
My minds own way

Nightfall is weaving its spell
Darkness hides the land within its shell
Twilight lights my way as I flow
Realms beyond imagination I go
