[Words: Orjatsalo, Music: Keranen]

As the sun rises
I see our banners flowing in the wind
And the sounds of trumpets calling for war

All that night I lay awake
Thinking you, thinking war
The madness and despair I have seen

Now the time has come
We will charge to our doom
Arrows are whistling by my ears as we ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Please my guardian angel
Let me see my love again
In the mercy I thrive
Shelter me, as I shelter mine

[Chorus]
I'm riding away
From the light of the day
A letter left behind to lighten my way
I'm writing to you
Maybe (the) last time now
Please let me see your face once more again

Screaming men I left behind
I am sure they all will die
Blood is covering my armor and my sword

Where is the honour? The code we all held?
In this madness we all turn to beasts
Gathered at a grim feast

Our banner is down
We are scourged to death
Flash of pain was the last thing I saw in my life

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
I'm dying away, I'm leaving today
My rusting sword, lost, alone in this fray
I wrote to you
My last farewell
Please let me see your face once more again
