[Anela:]
"gone are the nights
When we fought for our lives
Hurricanes of death and fame we overcame
There were friends we lost
Now their graves gather dust
I pray to gods to set us free
To give me peace

Water flows...slowly changing our souls
The long hand of dreamtime our pain consoles
Feel the light from the sun when we return as one
The fear disappears with the tides of war

Nightmares can kill
And they bend you to their will
Entering my nights and days, they condensate
Like a damp day's mist on my fears they all subsist
I pray to gods to hear my plea - to set me free

Water flows...slowly changing our souls
The long hand of dreamtime our pain consoles
I will stay...

Still keep searching for the way
The burden of pain shall help me concentrate
And the light from the sun can never be undone
The fear disappears with the tides of war"
