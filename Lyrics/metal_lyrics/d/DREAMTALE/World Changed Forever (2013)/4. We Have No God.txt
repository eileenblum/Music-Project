We are advancing through storm and the rain
For thousands of miles we have sailed
Searching for something, for something to gain
To live and be free a thousand more days

We live to discover and live to live more
Cheating and lusting to even the score
With our greed we will burn to the core
Until there are no secrets no more

We're sailing the sea - our illusion of hope
We've sold away our souls

You come in our way - we blow you away!
We bring you into the cold...
We have no god, we killed the lord above
We can do what we want and say what we want
And leave you into the cold!

We can believe if we choose to believe
You are the lambs that we seek to deceive
Maybe there's nothing or maybe there's more
We don't want to know we don't care anymore

You can pray if you want
You can ring all your bells
We'll bring you our own hell!
You mean nothing to us
You're easy to crush
We kill you in cold blood!

[John:]
"some will not see the devil in me
They seem to live in dreams
Still they're wondering why I'm conquering
Could I be really this cruel?
Leading a life with nothing inside
How could it all be true?"

[John:]
"I have no god and there is no soul
I am the man from the cold
I justify, then crucify
This is truth that I know"

Still we're advancing, the storm fades away
Slowly the fog reveals us a scene:
Lo and behold: there's a boat - hard-a-port!
Grab at the helm, we'll grab him on board

With a frown on his brow he is standing below
[Kaeo:]
"What is this thing untold?"
He looks right into us, but how can he trust?
He seems to be sure...
[Kaeo:]
"I feel at ease - there's worse in my dreams"
Now the old man is bound to utter a sound...
How will this tale unfold?
