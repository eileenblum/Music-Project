He is the lonely lord of demise
And knows what he wants
He is the one you shun for a cause
He feels no remorse
Preying on everything that he sees
He'll tear apart this tribe
Now as his eyes are fixed on the lonely
Maiden of this isle

[David:]
"I don't want to witness one more end
I see in her and angel, a heavenly friend
And that youth there? I was once like him
I see in his eyes the fear of a soldier's whim"

[Anela:]
"she has my lonely heart
She's bright like the morning star
She makes my soul lighter than air"

Oh, the pain and the greed
The loss you won't believe
The island is the heart of you and me

The world will be ablaze
And we're trapped in its maze
What is the point to live and die
If we knew we're living a lie?

[David:]
"I see her moving
Round the pyre gracefully
Like an ancient goddess beckoning me...
I'd trade my life and my soul
I'd give her all that I know
She makes my heart shimmer and glow"

[John:]
"And oh yes, I see something...
I'll take this heart
In a flash of a shooting star
There is no love greater than mine"
