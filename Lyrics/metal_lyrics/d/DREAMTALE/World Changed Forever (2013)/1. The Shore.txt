[Anela:]
"As the earth was still sleeping
I walked from my house
All the way up to the hills
With a peaceful and blissful dawn I was greeted
And palm trees were standing so still

Down the road through the gates
There my father was off to the shore
As he did every day
On a sailboat he left in the dawn

Then I looked to my right
Where the earliest light
Had begun to enlighten our walls
Another day waited me, to my own mystery
I was wondering the price of it all

Since the time we fought wars
And with scores after scores
Our brothers and others were slain
We had grown into one, we had basked in the sun
We had time to just live here in peace"
