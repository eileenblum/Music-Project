[Kaeo:]
"Hark now and heed to what I have told
It seems that the end came a long time ago
A new kind of time will forever join us
Into one with the earth and the sun...
All you deaf and blind, join my Dreamtime
Come and hear, come and stay, come and feel...

The rain kills the trees while the "drifters" fill the seas
A new kind of man brings a strange kind of peace:
Closed ears and eyes with his closed soul inside
Consumed by the entropy he made in his life
All you deaf and blind, join my Dreamtime
Come and hear, come and stay, come and feel...

Dreamtime - you can see the veil of lies:
This is all that will ever be...
Dreamtime - you're searching the meaning of life
But the fabric is woven in one with your time

Soon you can feel everything that will be
You planted the end you could not comprehend
A new time will burn us and turn us into dust
Into one with the earth and the stars
All you deaf and blind, come join my
Dreamtime
Stay forever and reach the speed of light...

Time without time that has been and will be
Leave all your fear and doubt - eternally
No human pain is left to remain
No consciousness, all preordained...
Life was a sham, just a pearl in devil's hand
A shadow in the promise of a man"
