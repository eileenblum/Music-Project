[Anela:]
"Late in the night we've gathered again
When the light has died we cherish the flame

I don't know why I'm feeling this way
But I hope you'll remember our tale today...
We're here alone and alone we shall die
But you know that once every man is alive
And life is all one, a celestial sigh
You can feel the breeze on your skin in twilight...

Sing now, my friends although this is the end
Who knows when we shall meet here again?
Sing now, my dear as the angels appear
As destiny threw us a chance to meet here...

Wait that the day will push you ahead
Pray that the rain will clean where we tread
Now that they've gone, what could I say?
They made the world what it is today

Dreams of joy and sadness remain
These songs and tales - they just ease the pain
We contemplate the path that we take
Remembering the ones who have left the world..."
