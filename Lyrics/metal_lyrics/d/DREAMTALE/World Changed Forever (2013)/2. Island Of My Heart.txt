Take a break to hear my story
It's a tale that'll live forever
With a chance to learn something as well
'cross the seas, beyond the ocean
Lies a land never heard before
Where a war was fought for no real cause

In a little while two worlds collide
One single isle, two ways of life
It's been this way throughout the times

See the sun shine on the island of my heart
As we begin to see signs
Of the dreamtime bending in the cruel wind
And break for the first time

World is changing...
Oh, it's changing...

Feel loss of a mourning father
And the pangs of a guilty conscience
See the dreamer that we all once were
And the wrath of the violent stranger
Ignorant to the path of love

See the death where the dreamer is you
Universe alive, two worlds collide
No sceptered isle, but an age-old tribe
So it will be for all dreamtime

World is changing...
Oh, it's changing...

There's a promise within each human heart
Sealed in, planted, at the start of your life
Success is measured only in the way
This promise is outweighed
By the circumstances you face
Or in the way you can weave your promise
Into the fabric of dreamtime
So that it becomes one
Eternal, ever-lasting, unchanging
A world in itself
