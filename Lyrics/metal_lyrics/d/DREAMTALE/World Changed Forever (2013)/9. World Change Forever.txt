[Anela:]
"The palms are lit by the starry sky
That's waiting for the dawn
I find my way back to my house alone
Watching the night, I see myself
And all the tears and fears within my soul
Now I feel the future unfold

So they came and they
Changed the world forever...

Wasting away, they were falling into
A hopeless time, no one'll survive
They brought a darkness, darker than I've known
Deep in my heart I will save a lightning
And fire it under a gorgeous thunder
I will not kill my will to carry on!

And so you came and you
Changed my world forever..."
