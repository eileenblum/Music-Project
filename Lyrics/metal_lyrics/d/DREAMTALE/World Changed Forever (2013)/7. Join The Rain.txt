[John:]
"I saw you dancing
Deep in the night, daring the flames
Your skin was alive, the curving shadows

Over the dunes with hands of bronze
Were too enticing...
My path to you was too short
The flame will burn us both...

Join the rain, my blackened angel
Feel my fiery wave as I turn you from ash to ash
I had you, hadnât a clue of what should not do
Join the rain - go, join the rain

I see in the sky: thousands of eyes
And none of them care, they seem to be mine
I never wondered if you had a soul
But maybe the stars will prove me wrong
My path to you was too short
I never felt your soul..."
