[Japanese bonus track]

The mighty dragon in her lair
There is no daylight and no air
There's pleasure, a treasure
There lies an endless nightmare
Go inside if you dare
Many heroes tried and failed

The lonely dragon in her lair
She-s got gold but she doesn't care
She-s waiting, for someone
To hold and not to run
She wants love, she wants passion
Many years she tried and failed

[Chorus 1:]
Now the years are passing by
Lady Dragon doesn't fly
She lies in her keep
Tryin' to sleep
Forever she dreams a river full of tears and sorrow
Longing for neverending love

The mighty dragon in her lair
She met a king with golden hair
He wanted the treasure
She wanted love and pleasure
He tried to cut her wing
Just one breath did kill the king

[Chorus 2:]
Still the years are passing by
Lady Dragon doesn't fly
Almost lost her wing
By the evil king
Forever she cries a river full of tears and sorrow
Longing for neverending love

[Solo]

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
