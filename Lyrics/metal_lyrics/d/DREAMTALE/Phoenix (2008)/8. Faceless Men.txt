[KerÃ¤nen / Visto]

Our world is slowly dying in agony and pain
At first we were so innocent
And then became so vain
Double-dealing lawyers
Ruthless people everywhere
'Cause we didn't ever learn
To give away and share

Faceless men in towers made of ivory and steel
Selling guns and praying for peace
They can make you suffer
Make your life so unreal
There's no cure, there's only disease
(We will lost it all)
Fortune and for fame!

Time has come
Big wheels keep on turning
Time has come
Half the World is burning
Time has come
There is no escape, no way out
Time has come

Ministers are preaching
They all know the end is near
The Armageddon's closer
Soon the reckoning is here
Money is still talking
Spreading violence and lies
All mankind in it's misery
Will pay the final price

Faceless men in towers made of ivory and steel
Selling guns and praying for peace
They can make you suffer
Make your life so unreal
There's no cure, there's only disease
(We will lost it all)
Fortune and for fame!

Time has come
Big wheels keep on turning
Time has come
Half the World is burning
Time has come
There is no escape, no way out
Time has come
