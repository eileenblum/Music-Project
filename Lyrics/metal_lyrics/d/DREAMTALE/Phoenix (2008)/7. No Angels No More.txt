[KerÃ¤nen / SeppÃ¤nen]

You passed trough this life
Born into mankind,
Mortal sins awaited you

I walked in the light
Never wanting to stray
Still your shade took over me

Now moving on
Departing so soon, so soon, so soon
Oh, I'd like to stay with you
But there are no angels no more
No angels no more

Darkness was the seed
And truly part of me
All sweet things must have an end

Yet again this pain is real
I know it will disappear
The shade is covering me soon

We won't see again
In certainty there's peace
And what we had here will remain

So beautiful and pure
Departing so soon, so soon, so soon
Oh, I'd like to stay with you
But there are no angels no more
The heavens are gone and so is our hell

Departing so soon, so soon, so soon
Oh, I'd like to stay with you
But there are no angels no more
The heavens are gone and so is our hell
