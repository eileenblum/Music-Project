[KerÃ¤nen / Ristolainen]

What is the matter with you?
What the hell you think you do?
Everyone can see you trough

You act like a holy savior
Somehow some damn superior
Oh! What a strange behavior

How does it feel to be so damn, self-satisfied?
What does it take to get your feet on the ground?

You're so lame with your fame
No one can ever take you for real
You and your friends ain't more than yesterday's news

The smell of green will always turn your nose
And that ain't right to those who have put their faith in you
You're yesterday's news

On the way to stardom, fortune and fame
Breaking promise is this the name of the game
Like a spineless, crave fool
No one's gonna trust in you

You're so lame with your fame
No one can ever take you for real
You and your friends ain't more than yesterday's news

The smell of green will always turn your nose
And that ain't right to those who have put their faith in you

You're so lame with your fame
No one can ever take you for real
You and your friends ain't more than yesterday's news

The smell of green will always turn your nose
And that ain't right to those who have put their faith in you
You're yesterday's news
