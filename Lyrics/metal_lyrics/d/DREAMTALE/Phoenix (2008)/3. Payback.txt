[KerÃ¤nen / SeppÃ¤nen]

Without a hint, out of the blue
My entire world fell apart
In their lust for power
My foes they went too far

They sent a man into my home
An assassin second to none
I only caught a glint of chrome
And saw his work was done

Tormented you will be
Revenge I will feed
No matter how you plead
Tonight you shall bleed

He got away and left the town
But he left me a trail
Enough for me to hunt him down
And I will make him pay

Tormented you will be
Revenge I will feed
No matter how you plead
Tonight you shall bleed
You stole all I had and you vanished in the night
The circle's complete now and I take your life

Like a clean, shiny on
On your uncharted skin
It's creamy cover, the raspberry spill
This steely lover is ready to kill

Tormented you will be
Revenge I will feed
No matter how you plead
Tonight you shall bleed
