[Japanese Bonus Track]A masquerade of our wounded souls 
I don't want to know where you are 
You filled my heart with your molten stone 
And my soul has ceased to believe 

Now I know that never is never 
Now I see that nothing's forever 
Now I know that never is never 

Tonight I'll close the gates and then I'll walk away 
Don't want to be a gambler between love and hate 
Tonight I'll close the gates, there's nothing left to say 
Don't want to be a victim between love and hate 

No one knows how our time passed by 
Our sweetest years are turning to grey 
I dream of youth, still I don't know why 
My passion fails to find my heart 

Now I know that never is never 
Now I see that nothing's forever 
Now I know that never is never 

Tonight I'll close the gates and then I'll walk away 
Don't want to be a gambler between love and hate 
Tonight I'll close the gates, there's nothing left to say 
Don't want to be a victim between love and hate 

No more hatred, no more sorrow 
No more heaven, no tomorrow 
No more crying, no pretending 
No more lies, no happy ending 

Tonight I'll close the gates and then I'll walk away 
Don't want to be a gambler between love and hate 
Tonight I'll close the gates, there's nothing left to say 
Don't want to be a victim between love and hate
