[KerÃ¤nen / SeppÃ¤nen]

Step aside, let us rise
Without fear into the storm
You've been out of place in time,
Since the day when you were born

You are forced into the wheel
The soundless wheel you cannot see
Let me be the one to
Guide you far from that life

Too long you have been living in sin
Wasting what you have and what you could
Now the storm's coming, well!
Let's go face the rain!

Just let them know

I'm going to be here
I got answers and nothing to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own believes, I don't need yours
I'm going to stay the course

Let's sway and pray
In the name of the storm
It's all the same, part of the game
Where you and I are pawns

Suddenly the clouds appear
The colors shades are green
What's a lightning like this time
When everything's surreal?

Just let them know

I'm going to be here
I got answers and nothing to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own believes, I don't need yours

Just let them know

I'm going to be here
I got answers and nothing to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own believes, I don't need yours
I'm going to stay the course
