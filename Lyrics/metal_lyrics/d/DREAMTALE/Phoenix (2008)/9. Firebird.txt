[KerÃ¤nen / Ristolainen / SeppÃ¤nen]

Ruthless pain is killing me
I cannot see the sun
We fought the mighty adversary
Still we haven't won

Waiting for my destiny
Grim reaper calls on me
Brace myself for eternity
Yet red and gold I see

I can hear the massive wings
And soothing tears I feel
Life begins to fill my veins
My wounds they start to heal

A faint scent of cinnamon
Reaches me trough air
I can see my savior
Flame up as a flare

Spread your wings
And shed your healing tears
Let the fire purify
In full blaze
You will meet the end
And then you shall transcend

A tantric resurrection
The city of the sun
A beautiful reflection
Of life spent on the run

In the atom's heart
Splitting souls inside
Vivid colors burn my eyes
On this wild bird I ride

Slowly gaining power
Patience is the key
What you need is a flame
That can burn you again
And the feeling of ecstasy

Wings like a bolt of lightning
Soaring to the sky
Only then, in the end
When you can see again
All the earth is beneath you and bright
