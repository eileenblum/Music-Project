[KerÃ¤nen / SeppÃ¤nen]

Cheated and down, there was not a sound
When my father was silenced in shame
Old and frail, just a forgotten tale
So they thought, but I'll prove them wrong

Learning from the best
Training hard, I passed their test
Heading home, I don't have time for rest

I am searching all around
Like a hunter, like a hound
And I focus on this task
They will meet their fate at last
I am searching everywhere
When I see them hiding scared
They will face my deadly stare

I choose to fight
For my pride and birthright
There are no other choices for me

Once I am done,
My life purpose is gone
My story has and uneventful end

Here I stand and their blood stains my hand
Yet somehow I feel so relieved
I understand I must soon kill again
There's meaning in just being mean

Learning from the best
Training hard, I passed their test
Heading home, I don't have time for rest

I am searching all around
Like a hunter, like a hound
And I focus on this task
You will meet your fate at last
I am searching everywhere
When I see you hiding scared
You will face my deadly stare

I choose to fight
For my pride and birthright
There are no other choices to me

I can no stop
Oh I love to fight too much
My victims are my purpose of life

And when at the end of my life
I see what I've done
I cannot help but feel
That once again all the pain
For our children will run trough
In the evil that men do
