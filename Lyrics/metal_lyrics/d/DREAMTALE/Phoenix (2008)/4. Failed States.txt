[KerÃ¤nen / SeppÃ¤nen]

Take a look at the powers that be
Still believing they're making history
Cruising on that diesel course
Forcing life into a long-dead horse

Every time one well is emptied
Another foreign strike is pre-empted
We're living on old fossil lives
And lead by men cheating for their prize...

Wars, shame and self-abuse
Failed states are on the news
All nations have to choose
Survival or the noose
We got the world to lose

Old men draining the land
Their souls turning to holes

Penniless men were given their pens
And the hanged-man rules
With his split-brain views
Blinded like mice we try to throw the dice
With our hands tied up
The money train don't stop
