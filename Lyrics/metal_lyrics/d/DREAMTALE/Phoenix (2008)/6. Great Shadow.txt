[KerÃ¤nen / SeppÃ¤nen]

Like the blind who envy those who see
Little children rebel against the creed
They believe there is nothing left to tell
But the truth is stronger than their shells

What the poets said is left unsaid
And lady beauty weeps on her death-bed
She was pierced by your trends and deception
Hugs Suffocated by your sterile preconception

It's hard to find, even to forget
This great new veil lies overhead
It hovers like a sickening plague, like a plague

A Great Shadow
Deafening, sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
Beckoning, bickering
Searching for the Light
A Great Shadow
Deafening, sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
In their minds, searching for the Light [x2]

Pleas a true emotion, meat deaf ears
Only crocodiles are shedding tears
And the masses reaching for their grave
Are too numb to even feel the shame

Whenever prophets raise their voices
Middle legions say they're being exploited
They prefer fake liberty without goals
In a constant puberty, under control

It's hard to find, even to forget
This great new veil lies overhead
It hovers like a sickening plague, like a plague

A Great Shadow
Deafening, sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
Beckoning, bickering
Searching for the Light
A Great Shadow
Deafening, sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
In their minds, searching for the Light [x2]
