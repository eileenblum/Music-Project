[Words: Orjatsalo]
[Music: KerÃ¤nen]

May it be a star?
A shining gem cut from the purest of heart
To light the way out of the shadows and dark

A fraction of dream
A memory to shine forevermore
To enlighten like a beacon light in the night

[Bridge:]
In the dark of night
New beam of light
To guide and light the way in the dark
Feelings of supremacy
I feel my rage unchained

[Chorus:]
Make my song ring through air
Make it shine like the stars in the night
As I give it to all of you
Make my song known to all
As I shove my song right down to your throat
And I give you what you deserve

What is a star?
An image wrought by those who could care less
Projection of their sick misguided brains

What became a song?
Simplicity bled in the altar of stars
And forever I shall mourn for it's fate

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
