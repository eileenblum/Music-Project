[Words: Tyni]
[Music: KerÃ¤nen]

For so many times I've burned my wings
Trying to reach out for the beauty of the Sun
I spread my wings and try to fly to the horizon
The pale light of dawn shines in my hopeful eyes

[Chorus:]
The dream of Icaros was to fly crimson sky-
Higher than our gods of dying ancient might
I reach for the memory of dying starlight-
To paint my name with fires of morning sky

The Sun burns my eyes as I fly higher-
My father's words have faded from my mind
The beauty of it all burned my eyes-
As I fell from the sky the dreams fallen in vain

[Chorus]

With wings of Icaros I search my place in life-
With dreams so fragile that can't bare this life
With wings of Icaros - I could not fly-
With wings of Icaros - I fell from the sky

[Chorus]
