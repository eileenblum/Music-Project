[Words: Ristolainen]
[Music: KerÃ¤nen]

Beautiful bride
And undaunted knight
Are lying in bed, holding hands
Side by side

They started their life
As husband and wife
And now it's time to show

How much they care for each other,
How far they're willing to go?

He moved on real nice
And made her come twice
But then he wanted
To put on some spice

Please hear me prey
I want you to stay
As still as you can be

[Chorus:]
I gave you a taste and you want for more
Let me come to your garden through your back door
Is there anything sweeter in whole wide world
Than ride with this magical wild horse

Oh, I'll taste you in my mouth
My hunger for you makes me howl like a hound
Shout, shout, shout, shout for more
I insist for another round

[Chorus]
