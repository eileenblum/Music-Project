[Words: Ristolainen]
[Music: Ristolainen]

Time after time
You close that door
And say to me:
"Can't stand no more"
But every time
When I'm away
You call to me:
"Please come and stay!"

[Chorus:]
You know it's hard to carry on
If you don't love me anymore
You say you need to lean on me
But can I too, lean on...

You want it all
To be young and free
Have family,
But can't you see:
You can't decide
What's right or wrong
Don't think no more,
It's time to go!

[Chorus]

You talk me 'bout your self esteem
How you think I've flushed it down the drain
You know the mirror hanging at your wall?
Take a good look in it and you'll find the real cause!

[Chorus]
