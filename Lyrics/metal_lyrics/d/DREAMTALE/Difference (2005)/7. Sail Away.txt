[Words: Ahola]
[Music: Ahola]

With the winds of fortune they went
Out to the sea to find land of the free
Set their sail for the setting of sun
Placed their hope in the journey begun

Hear the captain cry his commands
Feel the swaying of the ship, Can you
See the approaching storm?
That will take, will take it's price

[Chorus:]
Sail, sail, sail away, now
Dream, dream of green shores
Sail, sail, sail away, now
May the gods help on your way
May the fortune play part in this play

Fifty men and fifty souls
Placed their lives for the honorable goal
Set their sail for the setting of sun
Placed their hope in every single one

Hear the sailors cry for their life
As the sea cries for more, Can you
See the mast in the ocean
Sea will take, will take it's price

[Chorus:]
Sail, sail, sail away, now
Dream, dream of green shores
Sail, sail, sail away, now
May the gods keep from going astray
May the winds whisper the way...

Sail, sail, sail away, now
Dream, dream of green shores
Sail, sail, sail away, now
Sail to the haven of souls
Sail away where great heroes go...
