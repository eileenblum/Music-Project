[Words: Ahola]
[Music: KerÃ¤nen]

Cry out loud, the pain you feel it's the
Only way to make people see that you
Live and breathe, like humans do
In their hearts they know it's true

From the darkness into the light
Find out hope that lies within
Wipe out those tears for the past years
Forget what has been

[Chorus:]
Lost souls, lives unknown
Long forgotten yet near you and I
Hear lost souls, they're grieving alone
While we crave more and more
To our own selves

Day by day you feel something's near and the
Shivers run down at your spine, There are
People you know, people you don't
But something is right in between

From the daylight into the night
Drown in and feel the pain
Wipe out that grin out of your face
Don't forget what has been

[Chorus]
