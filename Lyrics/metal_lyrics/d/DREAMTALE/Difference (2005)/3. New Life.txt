[Words: Ahola]
[Music: KerÃ¤nen]

Come on lady, take my hand
It's time to let the new winds blow
Let's forget the past - That has truly gone too fast.

Here we are just you and me
With the time we've never seen
There is so much to learn - This is the next big turn

[Bridge:]
We can lift each other higher and higher
Like a butterfly we will - Live a new life

[Chorus:]
Between earth and sky, we all live and we all die
Ask the Moon or ask the Sun, There's only one life to live
As a pair (together) we're better (stronger) than we know
Like a New Life (yea)

This is a fine day like any other day
To make that pushing move
That makes a difference - Takes closer to the change.

Here we are just you and me - Together we are free
There is so much to see - Much more we can be

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
