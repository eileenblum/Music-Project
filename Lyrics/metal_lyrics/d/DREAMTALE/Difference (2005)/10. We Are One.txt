[Words: Tyni]
[Music: KerÃ¤nen]

Sun is closing it's eyes on us
I remember your touch
Close me into your arms
Give me hope

Come my darling, with me this night
Let's flt like birds in the sky
For the first time you'll be mine
In this magical night

I embrace you the final time
As moon paints the night
In shadows and darkness
You are my light

Forest whispers your name
As I kiss your sweet lips
For the las time you are mine
In this magical night

[Chorus:]
Dance between the rainbows
In the fields of love,
Emotions burning like fires
In the morning sky,
In twilight we are one!

Under the silvery light
I have to let you go
And you'll fly free
To the silent night

We are one forever
Together in our hearts
The memory of you and I
Will never fade away

[Chorus]
