Io and behold - yet another tale is told with me
This can never change all my thoughts
Left me stranded here alone they're all gone
A new disillusion in me: a stranger's illusion I need
I yearn to throw my disguise to unfold my
Deepest desires

But a voice says: "Think what you do better look 'fore you leap don't you know that it's not real?"

I should blind my own eyes to the tempting lies
Or my lust will tear me apart stand near the ledge
Of a bottomless pit do you dare?
Do you wanna know?
Reach to the end of the tunnel in your soul
Can you reach to me somehow?

Strangers inside my incandescent mind
Enticing my soul with your penetrating eyes
You gaze at the stars and wonder why you are
Another seeker - a bearer of light?

Oh yes, I know - they will never let me go
They wait for my last breath and while descending
To my final barbecue, I see you: in a veil
All-immersed in deceit with a righteous glow
Underneath you remind what you said all along
In the chorus of this song:

And she say:
"Think what you do better
Look 'fore you leap
Don't you know that it's not real?"

I should blind my own eyes to the tempting lies
Or my lust will tear me apart stand near the ledge of a bottomless pit do you dare?
Do you wanna know?
Reach to the end of the tunnel in your soul
Can you reach to me somehow?
