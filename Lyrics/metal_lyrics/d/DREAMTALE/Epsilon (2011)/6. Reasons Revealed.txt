Saints of the sun
In their journey back home
Whispering to me in their dreams
"The shadows of your sleep - tell us what they mean and if we clear your view, will you believe?"

Guided by the one
The One and Only Son
Interpreting his words to the world
Seeing in their mind
The fate of their own kind
They wonder where
Their place is on this earth

Reasons revealed
Now we know why they cried
Infraction revealed
Oh, we banished the light divine
The future is here
- I can see it all too clear
And it burns with the rays of the sun

Spirits high up there
Oh, listen to my prayer
Forgive me all this pride
Forgive me all my fear
Please let me see
And please sing through me
Show me where
My place is on this earth
