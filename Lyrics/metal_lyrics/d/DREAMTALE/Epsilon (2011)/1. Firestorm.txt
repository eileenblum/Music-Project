Deep in the storm, the fire is born or so this apprentice was told
Bright like an eye, a tiger's sweet lie
It's burning inside, while revealing my mind:
I want a war and silence no more
All my patience is finally at end

I walk the line, I pray to my kind
I'm sensing they're waiting me there
The fog and the rain, shrouding the plain
I know there is not far to go
Go and find a soul that can reach to my own
See the spark igniting us all

Make a fire of the storm
I am all but ready to die for your cause
Kill the liar, see his fall and this all shall be yours
Make a fire of the storm
And the tribe is ready to die...
...for your cause!

All through the day I hide in this maze
My thoughts slowly twisting my mind
Why all the pain? Why they died in vain?
There's something I feel there's betrayal again
I want a war and silence no more
All my patience is finally at end
Take my advise and learn from the wise
There's no truth only legends and lies

So listen to me we're not what we seem
The prophets have lied all along
There is no cure the pain will endure
There is only one reason to live:
Go and find a soul
That can reach to your own
See the spark igniting us all
