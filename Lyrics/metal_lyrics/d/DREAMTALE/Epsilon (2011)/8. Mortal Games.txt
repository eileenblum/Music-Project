I entered the world not like my own
A place for a cold, pale race, we walked through
An aisle - no gestures, no smiles
Barren and plain they were
What is this life? This stagnating hell
You might as well kill yourselves

I won't be sucked into this...
A mire of men who die, the mind of mortals true
Shackles you all...

I see people willing to lose wasting their chances
When they couldn't choose, why would you throw it all away?
Why would you play your life like a game?

I shall live on, I'll always move on
I'm learning the secret signs, I know where I've been, the things I have seen
Thus, I can still proceed, look at your lives
Dig deeper inside, who know what you will find?

And don't be sucked into this...
A mire of mine who die, the mind of mortals true shackles you all...

I see people willing to lose, wasting
Their chances when they couldn't choose
Why would you throw it all away?
Why would you play your life like a game?

If you close your mind like a fool
There's no future or justice for you
Why would you throw it all away?
Why would you play your life like a game?
