You don't see a single thing I see, your conscience is blind
And your spirit's drowning deep
In the swamp of your lies
I'm a monster that's breaking through your mind
And when I'm done
You can't deny my delight

I am so sick and tried of all your words
I could bleed someone dry and your minions, they shall
Learn as I leave you to try beneath a blazing sky
Burning your eyes, hear the roaring high above
As you die

I shall cross your way, as you fade away
Angel of light, your demon and demise
I foresee that day, my righteous hate will
Decimate the lies , my light will shine

Close your eyes, I'll forgive you now is your
Chance to repent remember how it feels cos'
I was once like you just a fool who thought the
Knew it all stumbling in the dark

you don't  see a single thing I see, but still you go on like
An old man that's in need of someone to hold on
I'm a monster that's breaking through your mind, just don't
Resist and I will show you the light

I am not in the mood for foolish games
I won't wait 'til you say, I will strike you down and leave
You to meet with your fate beneath a blazing sky
Burning your eyes, hear the roaring high above
As you die

I shall cross your way as you fade away
Angel of light I'm laughing at your side
I foresee that day my righteous hate will
Decimate the lies, my fight will shine
