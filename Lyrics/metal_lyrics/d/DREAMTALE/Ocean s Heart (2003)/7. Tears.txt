[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Orjatsalo]

Look to the mirror
What do you see?
Beneath the shadows
Hiding your face
I can see hatred
Consuming fear
There is no reason
No cause to live
Beneath and buried deep down
There still is hope
Come with me follow
Way to the light
[Chorus]
Crying for sake of our sins
Weeping for our fate
Quietly I face pouring rain in the night
Washing our faces where we stand
Sign of desperation
I slowly walk from the light
[Solo]
Beast stirs in its sleep
Feed the flames, fester hate
Burning embers, fiery eyes
Spill your blood, you will die!
Whispers of darkness, lead you astray
There is no truth in those
Heart still beats, there's life in you 
where there is life, yet hope still remains
In darkness I feel
Kind of silence
Fear is the key 
To open that door
Embrace my wounded heart
Take me to dark
Follow path of hate
New meaning to my hateful life
[Chorus]
