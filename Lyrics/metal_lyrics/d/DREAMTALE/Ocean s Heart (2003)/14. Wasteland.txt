[Japan Bonus]
[Music: Orjatsalo, Words: Orjatsalo]

Mercy is for weak
It it blood we all bleed
To kill or to die
The cause of my life
For king for country the patriot has died
In vain he ended his life
Raven flies high, high above the fading light
The covering darkness hides wasteland from the eyes
We all gave our lives 
In vain we all died
Blood of our kin
It tainted the soil
Raven flies high, high above the fading light
The covering darkness hides wasteland from the eyes
[Chorus]
Wash away our sins
Salvation in the waves
The seas cold embrace 
All your tears in vain
To the night they fade away
The darkness swallows light of day
Only sea remains
[Solo]
[Chorus]
