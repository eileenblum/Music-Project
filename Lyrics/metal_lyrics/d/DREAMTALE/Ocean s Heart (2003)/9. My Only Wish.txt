[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Tyni, MÃ¤kinen]

All is lost
There's nothing to gain
Time has gone 
Nothing but pain
Dreaming of freedom, walking in the rain
In silent night I see all what's left
I end my life of hate and regret
My only wish is to live and forget
I give my life, I give up my soul
I have no fear, I have no place to go
[Bridge]
I only wish to end this nightmare
I only want a way out from this life
[Chorus]
There is nothing but grief in my heart
Only lonelyness by my side
Cold night out somewhere calls me quietly
Waiting for the miracle this pains adore
So give me way out fo this life
End this nightmare give me hope
Darkness embracing wintry eves falling
All in my burned cell I say you farewell
[Bridge]
[Chorus x2]
