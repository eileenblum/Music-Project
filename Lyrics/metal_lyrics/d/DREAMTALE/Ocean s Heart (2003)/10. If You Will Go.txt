[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Ristolainen]

I close my eyes and hear your voice
You will always be my only choice
As you speak the words of love
I sense the warmth and feel so calm
I barely feel your fingertips
Across my skin and on my lips
The feeling that you are close to me
Makes me shiver, makes me weep
[Chorus]
No one is more than you
Nothing compares to you
If you give my love away
You'd better know the game you play
'Cause my heart will loose a home 
If you will go
[Solo]
I wish this night to last forever
And we could always be together
But by the dawn you'll be gone
And once more I'll be left all alone
Before you go my precious one
My only love, my brightest sun
I have one wish before you fly
Please come back tomorrow night
[Chorus x2]
