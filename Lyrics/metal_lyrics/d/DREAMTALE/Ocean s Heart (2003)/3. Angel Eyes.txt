[music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Orjatsalo]

There she was standing
'Neath a waterfall
His heart is bleeding
For that memory
Her eyes they haunt him
For years to come
Misleading his heart
Tears it apart
Years have passed by
From that night
Memory still haunts me
Fate still decides 
Way of our life
Choice was never ours
Make my heart
Whole again
Oh! Please stay with me
[Chorus]
Angels eyes, I saw in you
I reach for that light, it shines so bright
Touching my heart, tearing apart
To have you in my arms
Angels Eyes
Ingating feelings, flames are reaching to the heart
Fiery emotions, 'till the embers burn
Touching the soul, desire breaching mind
Reach out for stars, you will burn like fool
Who gave his heart in vain
Do you not fear me?
To see, it is to believe
Reach out for my heart
For you I give it to keep
[Solo]
[Chorus x2]
