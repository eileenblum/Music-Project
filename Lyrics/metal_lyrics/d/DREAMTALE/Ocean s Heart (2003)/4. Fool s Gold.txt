[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Orjatsalo]

Gather ye 'round me, and do bend your ears
For this story you're about to hear
Intriguing tale of deceit and sin
Of honor and duty as well
[Bridge]
This story takes place in our city of gold
A place I once hailed my home
Ruler the king with heart so cold
His greatest desire to own
[Chorus]
So hear my tale, sing with me
Of that never fullfil
Greed of old, fools gold
Decay on our rulers heart
Burning the bridges, the road to home
He yearned only treasures to hoard
Sealing our fate he set his sight
For gold 'way from the light
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus x2]
