[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Ristolainen]

There is only one king
We will ride beside him
Troops are fearless
And we are at his disposal
At the battlefield 
We'll form the toughest shield
The honor of the king
Is in our hands
Our master is guarded
By crew of two hundred men
Red sun reveals a misty ground
And silent - has fell the battle's sound
Deceivers - came to claim his crown
And no one's left alive
New day will arise
[Chorus]
Hail to our lord
He has led us with his sword
We shall follow his footsteps for eternally
Wherever he'll go, the army will follow
With the strength 
Of two hundred men
[Solo]
[Chorus]
