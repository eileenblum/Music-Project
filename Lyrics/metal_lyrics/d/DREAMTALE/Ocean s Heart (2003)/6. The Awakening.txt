[Music: Orjatsalo, KerÃ¤nen, Words: Orjatsalo]

More that you'll get, the more will you want
Nothing can please you, to cease you to yearn
You reach out for sun, you bore under ground
What lies there for you?
Searching for riches and treasures of old
Nothing can please your hunger for gold
Burrowing under, reaching for stars
But now you have reached too far
No! What have you done
Now it is time to pay
[Chorus]
Feel your heart 
Beating in the dark
You have invoked the beast beneath
No one can hear your scream
Now the spiral is spinning too fast
Any second might be your last
Your heart was led by greed
From your soul the beast will feed
[Solo]
Once again I feel my heart
Beating my lifeblood through my veins
Woe upon thee and thy kind 
For thou hast 'wakened the slumber of mine
Hatred shall be my wine
Fear my meat
With your soul I shall feast
[Chorus x2]
