[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: MÃ¤kinen, Orjatsalo]

The garden, where we walked together
As the wind was breezing, whispering
Where we played with innocent smiles
Under trees and leaves of green
Leaves fell silently icy ground
Flying away with the northern wind
And they shine as silvery stars
That fall on your nightly face
[Bridge 1]
So hear my voice, come with me
Dream of eternity
Join me and sing
Tale of that silent night
[Bridge 2]
Sing with me, dream my dreams
For me and for you
Under the trees, growing forever
Garden of eternity
[Chorus]
And we sing together as the winds called our names
Eternally our lives entwine as vision foretold
In that summernight, where shadows are warm
An eagle cries high that melody so old
[Solo]
We shared the realm of secret dreams
And eternal stars lightened the dark
The moon blessed your glittering tears
As you cried for our destiny
In the twilight of shimmering stars
Garden embraced by winter's heart
Your hands holding me and burning the fear
Forever within my heart
[Bridge 1]
[Bridge 2]
[Chorus]
