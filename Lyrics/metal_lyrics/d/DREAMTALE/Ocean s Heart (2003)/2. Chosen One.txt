[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Orjatsalo]

A journey through my mind
Beyond the wheel of time
To the darkness 'hind my eyes
All those years in vain I fled
My fate I tried to escape
Lost my cause from the start
[Bridge 1]
Falling freely
On wings of will
My fate was sealed from the start
[Bridge 2]
Crying my pain
For your sake
For love that never fades away
[Chorus]
Mindless, like a pawn
Misleaded by darkness
Shadows, mere memories
Of time that could have been
Silently I face you
Believing once again
In my fate - Chosen One
[Solo]
[Bridge 1] 
[Bridge 2] 
[Chorus]
