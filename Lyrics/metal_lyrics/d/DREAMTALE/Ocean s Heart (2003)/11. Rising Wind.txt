[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Words: Orjatsalo]

Dying hope, failed quest
I dream my life again
My time is running out 
and soon my life will end
I have seen my life
Fading in front of my eyes
I have seen my time 
Wasted in pointless lies
I can't reach your life 
When all hope is lost
Our dreams will sink with hope
As our lives came to end
Now I reach you through time
Oh, won't you please come with me
Broken dreams, torn hero
Dying hope I am
I can't reach you, I can't save you
I've failed you
I have failed my people, I have failed their trust
Now my soul is rising with the wind to the stars
I can sense the wind is rising
I can feel the storm is closing
I can hear lightning cracking 
Sky burning white
[Chorus]
Now I feel wind rising, carrying me to the stars
Into the light I will fly with you
Away from this world, we will leave our lives
Blown away by the rising wind
[Solo]
[Chorus x2]
