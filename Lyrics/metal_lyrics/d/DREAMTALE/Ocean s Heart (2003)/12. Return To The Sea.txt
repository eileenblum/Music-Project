[Music: KerÃ¤nen, Vuorinen; Words: Ristolainen, Orjatsalo]

The ocean so vast, can not see skyline
Sun's burning hot and the sea's dead calm
Traces of pain, flashes of fear
Could it all have been true
Tiny wave send by God
Build up into a wall
To wash away the sins of mankind
Leaving no traces of life
[Chorus]
The price of wealth was too high to pay
Disaster struck over opulence
Gone was all that glory
And bale was total
The prophecy was true
Thus it came to fullfil
Now return, return to the sea
[Solo]
So many men gave up to the sea
It washed away their pride
Greed, vanity, shallowness
Rectified by waves
Now the city rests in peace
In a cold lonely tomb
In the depths of sea
Aeons of wealth came to end
Into sea they descent
[Solo]
[Chorus]
