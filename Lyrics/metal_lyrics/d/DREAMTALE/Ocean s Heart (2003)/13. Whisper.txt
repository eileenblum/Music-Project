[Music: Vuorinen, Words: Tyni]

Fading moment, fading memory
A faint wraith of the past
(yesterdays fainting ghost)
Grieving nation, weeping love
Shattering dream of the past
(yesterdays fragile dream)
Forever crying for it's pain
Eternally missing you
Forever sensing your scent
Eternally recalling your words
Whisper it to the wind
So shall it vanish
Blow it to the sand
So shall it perish
