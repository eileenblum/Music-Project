Scars and the pain I still hold in my heart
I remake I and grow
They generate and transform who I am
And I will let them show

No. I'm not ashamed of the life
That brought me here
And I know that I won't ever find truth
If I can't see clear

Silent prayer is all I dare to hold
It will soar the sky like a rainbow
So I cried these words
Even angels overhead:
Oh Lord, embrace my scars

I will arise if you call my name
From my slumber I awake
I am so grateful you showed me your face
I will bow to feel your grace

And each time I die again
I don't fear the dark
Shining through my soul your light
Guiding me into the afterlife

I shall go on, be reborn through pain
My ordeal will reveal what my demons stained
There's no way to escape if you say the truth
It's the irony of life. That we can't choose
