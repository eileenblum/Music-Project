Hold your facade, be a good little boy
As you play with the truth
As is life was just a ploy
Then you rape the words with madness
As you kill the world with "good"
So rosy are those lenses wich you see through...

Label me, label all who disagree
From behind your walls
You can shoot item in their knees
And still holding up your shady shield
A saint you are indeed...
Work the lurid tongues of your entourage...

Oh, behold...
How the fools said that life's a game
And goodness merely fame
They close their eyes
To find dull darkness in their minds
Honesty makes you free
So they shackle you with lies
And I won't forgive them for their crimes

You put words in my mouth
Isn't that what you're about?
Tiny mind, running numb
Seeking shade from the sun
You won't take a stand or understand
It's time to go beyond
You just hide behind your cunning camouflage...

Your sick cabal... ritual bizarre
Drown in caviar... you can't kill us all
You've gone too far...
