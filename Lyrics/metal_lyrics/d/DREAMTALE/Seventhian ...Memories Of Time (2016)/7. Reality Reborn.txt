I see trees
In the blue horizon of the night
They call to me, reminding me
Of when I was a child
And everything beguiled my lonely soul

Now all my thoughts fly through the walls
You should know

I won't lie:
I saw signs
Mind awakening
Reality reborn
I feel alive
Second to divine
Join me in the dawn
Reality reborn

How come the world
Never ceases to burn in my mind?
Blackened and defiled
I've slept my life
I've lived to die
When I really needed dreams
To really see what doesn't need belief

And all those scales before my eyes
Seem to fall
