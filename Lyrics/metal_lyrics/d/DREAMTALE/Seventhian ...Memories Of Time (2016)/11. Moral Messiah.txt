There's no way in
To a mind that's closed
No a single thing that you could say
Tragic, insane or amusing at best
It's like you're watching donkeys do ballet

It's black or white, dogmatic design
And faith realigned out of control...

Steer away now - ideology reborn
Clear the road now - for the sacred cow
Hide away now - the Messiah so proud
Will condemn you to hell if you're found

Lay on the line the news of today
Contemplate the arguments both ways
Then watch them all
Swiftly thrown out, ignored
No one can dethrone the Holy Lord
