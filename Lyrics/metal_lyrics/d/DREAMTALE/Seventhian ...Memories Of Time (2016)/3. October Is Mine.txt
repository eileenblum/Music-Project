Silent the prayer that I sent to hey way
And my tears - they fall on my lines
When we were one I could play. I could run
There was nothing to fear
All the clouds seemed to clear

I can remember
That bright autumn day
When you died
October is mine

Mindless hours I spend in my bed asking why
I should face all my friends
Or proceed with life?
Fantasy turned to tragedy
But in this emptiness - October is mine

Finding my way in the darkness of day
I am blind. To happiness and light
And I recall as the leaves started falling
You knew it was time
Although I needed time

All this time I feared that day
I wish we both had together gone away
Then the pain we'd share the same
Like the dancer we'd join the rain
