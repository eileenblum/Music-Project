Blinding through my sight and soul
I can feel the coldness grow
Fall down in a tunnel of light
But it ain't the final show

I've seen it all way before
I know the clowns get an encore

There's a black cauldron waiting me
Boiling and steaming
Demons with pitchforks beckoning
Laughing and smiling

Oh, it's the party of my life
Hit the third gear I am ready to die

I'll return, turn, turn
Won't be long
Sure I'll burn, burn, burn
But the fire makes me strong
I'll return, turn, turn
Say farewell and we'll see soon
I'll return ...to you

See all the poor horn-heads cry
As I play with the like toys
They'll see that I'm the devil himself
It's a picnic I enjoy

Oh, this inferno is my home
I'm just checking in to have some fun
