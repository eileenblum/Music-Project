I don't wish to fight no longer
I just cannot lie
Here tonight, in the afterlife
I can see that this ain't right
Through the window into my soul
I can feel the freedom flow
I don't care if I cannot go

I have no tales to tell
A lonely soul - I'm Raphael
Some day you'll see the gates of hell
'Cos I'm ready to die

So far, far away
I see my birth on my dying day
And I feel I lived so true
Oh, so long ago
I saw my father's eyes slowly close
And I know I live so true

I don't wish to fight no longer
But I wonder why
The perjuries of my enemies
Still obfuscate their minds
Cowardly and insincere
Facind me - their greatest fear
Rotting in ther foul-smelling holes

I have no more to say
As I know that truth will rule the day
Your kind will play the fool's charade
Seeling your snake-oil...
