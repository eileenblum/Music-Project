In the battle for life I failed
All my journeys. I've gone astray
And I know that only the rich prevail
Oh, the ignorant shaking their tails

Won't you guide my metal tonight?
Call out the war

I'm the one to show the sun
And to light the flames
For our future
I would die

All you need's to learn their deeds
And to know their names
For our future
They will die

We were told to safeguard the truth
From the humbling. Sensless fools
They keep teeling us to bend the rules
Oh, continuing their misrule
