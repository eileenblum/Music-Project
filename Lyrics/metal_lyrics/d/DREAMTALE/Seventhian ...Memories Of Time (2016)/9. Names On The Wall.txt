Walk through my door
Here in the early dawn
Say hello to all my pain
And apprehension
I can't go on
I know I don't belong
I have changed too much to simply
Stay and play along...

This road's unknown
Will I fail or move beyond?

I, I did no wrong
Where were you
When I fell to the floor on my own?
And cried, cried from my soul
For soon the day will dawn
And we are gone
We'll become names on the wall

I wanted more
And you should not ignore
What we have accomplished
And how it all was done
I see it clear:
We're all just musketeers
Fought together day to day
And year to lonely year

I must stay strong
Will I fail or move beyond?
