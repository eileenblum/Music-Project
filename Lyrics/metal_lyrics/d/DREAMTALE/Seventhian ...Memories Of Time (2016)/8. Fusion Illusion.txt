There was a time for solar signs
We mystified the twilight when it died
You claimed we would go into
The galaxies so blue
We'd find the pearl in the sky...

Oh, I want you to say the words
That will favor my tride
(and) find me my bride
Who will know how she feels
When the rays feel skin.
Reveal eternity within?

My sun. So high above
All that I want
Is that you burn me alive
In my soul fusion will use the hydrogen
And my love is helium
Our only sun

Another play with solar flames
Emphatic shame our tears could not convey
You claimed space would hold the truth
It's not a pure vacuum
We'd find the pearl of the sky...

All my love dies with the sun
There's a time for solar flames
And all our games we play within our souls
