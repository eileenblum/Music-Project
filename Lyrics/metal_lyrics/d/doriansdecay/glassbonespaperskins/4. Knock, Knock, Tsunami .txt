Waking up gets harder every day, the face that I see, is not who I want to be. It's hard to find comfort in things that I regret, because there's things in my life, that I wish I could forget. So now I find myself retracing my steps. This journey I have taken has taught
me many things, you have to have faith in all that you do, and I know he's watching over you. You are never alone. This is when the battle begins, this is when we prove our faith. When all is lost, and there's nothing left do you stand tall? Give it all you got, reach
down in your heart and put in everything you've got, there's no time to leave anything behind, this is your final calling. This is your life, live as you wish, and leave nothing behind.
