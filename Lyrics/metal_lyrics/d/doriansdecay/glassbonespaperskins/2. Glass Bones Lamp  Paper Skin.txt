Give me wings like the birds that rule the sky. Give me hope so I can leave this emptiness behind. I've been lost, I want to be found so angels save my soul, from this pain and let my life not be in vain. I've tried to find a place where I belong but I've had no luck, so
now I want to be gone. There's a place I wish to go and things I wish to see, but being here on earth isn't where I want to be. I need a new life, somewhere far away with you I want to be up there, in the sky, so please God, give me a sign, make the angels come down, and
pick me up, I need to be with you, I need to see the stars from above.
