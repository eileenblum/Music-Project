Fly with me, on my wings, hold on tight, while we soar these seas. Search in your soul and find what you've been looking for. Search in your soul and find your true potential. We are meant to be, so much more, than skin and bones. We are meant to be, so much more. We are
meant to be saviors. No matter how hard you try, you will never blind me. I see my future and I go to it. We all have our own purpose and mine is to save. We all have our own purpose and mine is to save, and mine is to save you. Throw at me what you may, I will never
back down. Explore the unseen and all that's been lost along the way. Tonight we rediscover what we buried long ago.
