Leave me in despair with all my dreams, withering. Tie me to the air so I float away, shivering. So please, help me as I find my way. I need a place to rest my feet I've been wandering for days. Nights so cold, left alone never knowing, where to go. Nights so dark, I
need a spark to light the road, to lead the way. I need you more than ever right now. Please, don't let me down. I put my faith in you and yet here I am, lost and alone. There's nowhere else to go, I'm here for good. Lost, alone, forgotten. There's nowhere else to go.
Free my soul, so I can finally escape this place.
