I've seen the jet planes crash
And oil tankers galore.
I've seen Mexicans in boxer shorts
With pacific ocean pompadours.
I've seen gay penguins fuck
And bison roam through golden gates.
Seen dogs die on my welcome mat.
Seen my best friend's girlfriend masturbate.
I've seen half-empty beds
(What good are dreams?)
I've seen friends stuck with mortgages
(What good are dreams?)
(What good are dreams?)
(Good for nothing)
I've seen men make more out of dreams
(What good are dreams?)
(Good for nothing)
Than dreams'll ever make of them.
Clearly, wearily
Life is but a scheme
Where you say there's
Blue butterflies
Where blue butterflies have never been.
Some with Uncle Sam
Me?
My uncle Rick:
All I see is scattergoods
And all I smell is shit.
What good are dreams?
What good are dreams?
What good are dreams?
What good are dreams if they come true?
What good are your dreams?
He says, what good are your dreams
What good are your dreams
If all your dreams come true?
