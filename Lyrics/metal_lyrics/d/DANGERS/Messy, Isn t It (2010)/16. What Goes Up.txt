I was there
I sucked the bodies up my nose
Asbestos
And femurs
And nylon pantyhose
I should have cried
I tried to cry
I should have cried
I could not cry
Not saying it's good
Not saying it's right
But I guess my body don't trade tears
For the pinstripe kind of life
What goes up
Liars
Liars
Set my skinny jeans (suit and tie) on fire
Ashes, ashes
We all fall downtown
What goes up...
