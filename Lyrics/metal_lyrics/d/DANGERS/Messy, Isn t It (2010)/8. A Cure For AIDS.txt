You are going to die
Your parents, your children
They're all going to die
Slow, painful
With a methadone drip
Ain't no Trojan I know
Don't change nothing at all
Not some latex
Not some cocktail of pills
No T-cells
No magic
No hospital bills
A cure ain't a cure if a cure don't change nothing at all.
You're still going to die.
Cause death is still waiting
Death ain't got nothing but time
No bloodwork
No serum
Will keep you alive
So stop waiting
Stop wasting your time
Fuck bareback
Fuck till you choke on your
Life ain't worth living if all that you want is a
Cure ain't a cure if a cure don't change nothing at
All of my life double knotted by fear
And sometimes this fear is what keeps me here
I want to live a life drenched in the rain
No umbrella
No condom
And no vaccine
I want to live a life drenched in the rain
I'd rather die young than die young at heart.
