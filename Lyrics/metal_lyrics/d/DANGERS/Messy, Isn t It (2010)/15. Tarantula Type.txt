This sickness that's inside of me
Ain't a sickness that's easy to see
No rash, no runs, no potpourri
Of symptoms
Of woes
No bloody stool
No bloody nose
Just cause you can't see it's there
Don't mean that the shit isn't there
Stitched into this birthday suit
Oh grandmother, How I miss you
Like a banshee
Sid and Nancy
My double helix is coming unglued
It's in your blood
It clogs your veins
Eats your gorgeous brains
And it will drag you straight to your grave
Quick
A head in the clouds
Is a foot in the grave
A head in the clouds
Is a foot in the grave
But a foot in the grave is where I'd rather be
If a head in the clouds means I'm sick
I'm not sick
You're the one that's sick
Rick, Serve me my goddamn breakfast.
