It's raining, it's pouring,
This story's getting oh so boring.
And what else did you expect?
When it rains, someone always gets wet.
So it's searchlights
Or the shadows.
With a newscast like that, Dan, I'd rather the gallow.
'Cause I ain't seen a life vest in days
That ain't strapped round the eyewitness men
Making dayjobs out of your dismay.
When the saints go marching into the streets
It's too bad they won't know how to swim.
It's pouring.
It's raining,
But from this couch it seems much more like entertaining.
Oh, what the fuck's wrong with me?
All these bodies float 'round my head, Your town
And I still sleep so damned flawlessly.
When the saints go marching into the streets
I'll be the one fast asleep.
Too selfish to weep.
If I could, yes I would, but it seems I can't.
Iâm sorry.
When the revolution comes to this land
(Oh lord, I want to be in that number)
When we rich go out and stack those sandbags
(I want to be in that number)
When we all have enough water to drink
(Please, please let me be in that number)
When our leaders learn to cry at our feet
(I want to be in that number)
When the saints go marching in.
