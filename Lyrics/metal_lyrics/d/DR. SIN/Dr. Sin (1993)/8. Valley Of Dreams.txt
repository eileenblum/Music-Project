Last night a dream stole me away from reality
Kind of shook me up
Left me lying, shaking in a cold sweat

But like the moth of proverbs
I was drawn into the flame
So afraid to wake up
And find myself insane

Why don't you slip away with me
To this place I've found
But watch the road you take
Cause heaven's just a step away from hell

We can make the rules
Break them anytime
In the valley of dreams
We'll commit the perfect crime

We can make the rules
Break them anytime
In the valley of dreams
We'll commit the perfect crime
