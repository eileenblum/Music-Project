Looking through my window
I see a shining star
It seems like it's telling a story to me
So hard to stay without you baby
In this empty room still we see your face in the dark

Nothing really matters
'Cause baby now you're gone
Nothing really matters
Only you..........

Sitting here playing my old guitar
Tryin' to sing what I'm feeling inside
You ler hard times tear us apart
I'm not that strong
But I just carry on

Nothing really matters
'Cause baby now you're gone
Nothing really matters
Only you..........

How long will we be wasting our time
Remember the night you lay by my side
