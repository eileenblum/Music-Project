Lying face down in the street
People look but no one cares, no! no! no!
You threw your life away
Now you're mourned with empty prayers

You never thought you'd pay the price
And now you have to pay it twice
All the lies no one believed
It's only you who was decieved

I've lost so many friends
Down that one way road
It hurts so bad to know that
They're all stone cold dead

Rusty needles stuck in flesh
Two kinds of poison in your veins,
yeah
Raging wild in the streets
I've wasted all my tears in vain,
All in vain
