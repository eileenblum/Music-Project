This time you went too far girl
With all the lies you told and all the games you played
Don't know what your problem is
You had everything and more
I know we had some bad times
And some bad times had us too
You try to put the blame on me
And pushed us back the point of no return

Too late you crossed the line
If I live forever wouldn't change my mind
Like a deal with the devil it's been carved in stone
The fire burns cold in this poor boy's soul

There can be no turning back
The die is cast the bridge is burned
There are no rules to tie me down
And no more tears to shed for you
Too late...............
