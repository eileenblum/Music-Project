[Creedence Cover]

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know
It's been comin' for sometime
When it's over so they say
It'll rain on a sunny day
I know
Shining down like water

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know
Been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know
And it can't stop, I wonder

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day
