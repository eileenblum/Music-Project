Nothing is true but money talks
Better believe that bullshit walks

All the things for which we plead
Are our desires but not our needs

The road we're on leads straight to hell
When we'll arrive only time will tell

God forgive us, sons of sin
He has promised this all must end
God forgive us, sons of sin
Change our ways or we cannot win
