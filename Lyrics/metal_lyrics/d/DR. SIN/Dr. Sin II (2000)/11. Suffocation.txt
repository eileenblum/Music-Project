I'm sick of exploitation
Nothing but suffocation
So tired of false
Statementes
To much alienation

When will we face the
Truth
Are we all fools?

No, nobody is gonna tell
What to do
No, I'm really not afraid
Lose

Don't push your medication
Insane intoxication
We're lost illusion
Blind faith and no
Conclusion
