Don't wanna talk about it
Don't wanna hear no more
Why are you always cryin'
Why can't you find the door
Same old story
Day after day

You're living an illusion
You're living in a dream

You're not a child anymore
Get a grip it ain't no war
Get a life, get it now
Cut the shit, you fuckin'clown

If you wanna be a loser
There's nothing I can do
It's your own life
That you're ruinin'
Why you always play the fool?

Same old story
Night after night

Stop living an illusion
Stop living in a dream
