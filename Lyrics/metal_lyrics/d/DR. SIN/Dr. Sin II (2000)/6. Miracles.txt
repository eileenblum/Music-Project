Tell me now
Just tell me what you see
If you believe in miracles
And dreams
You can make it real

Into the night
Shadows of light
Leading the way
Showing us how
We can open our eyes

Nowhere to turn
Lessons to learn
Teaching us how
We can play this game

No one can break the speel
But many have tried
Be strong you're not alone
Don't never say die
You must believe
Believe and carry on

Say what you will
All that you feel
Then you'll find the
answers to the questions
That you always knew

Give it sometimes
Leave it behind
All of your fears
You need to open your mind
