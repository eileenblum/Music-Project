Too young to die, stop
Flyin'little child

She never had a good life
She never had a real home
Living in a fast lane
She's got no clue 'bout
What's right or wrong

She's got no one
But she doesn't mind
She'getting high
Drowning in a bottle
Of wine

She's way too crazy
So wild and crazy

She looks like an angel
She's got the devil inside
With a sweet little smile
Watch it she can hypnotize

She's got no one
But she doesn't mind
She'getting high
Drowning in a bottle
Of wine

Looking in her eyes
And you'll touch the sky
She'll take your soul

She rules the night
At the speed of light
A perfect crime
