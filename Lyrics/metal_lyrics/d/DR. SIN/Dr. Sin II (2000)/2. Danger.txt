Wake up
We've gotta get out
There's no time left
There's nothing left
Here for me

In my mind
you won't find
No answers
The nightmares
Has just begun

Oh Oh
I've got a feeling
Something is coming
And I know
It's coming for my soul
Oh yeah

Oh  Oh
I feel the danger
All around me
And my heart
Is beating
Out of control

Darkness is on me
It's out there
Waiting for you
And for me
Someone help me
I just can't find
I can't find a safe
Place to hide
