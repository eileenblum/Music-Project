Time after time
Living in memories
Crossing the line
Of reality

Lives passing by
Watching my destiny
Voices are calling
From deep in my mind

Alone in dark
I fear the night
No words can explain
Am I insane?

If I think
Of all the pain
I couldn't make
Me through
Another day
Another way

Where will I find
Peace of mind
Before my eyes
My life slips away
Fades away

Wondering why
Nothing seems real to me
Watching the hands of the
Click tick away

It's like a bad dream
No one can hear me scream
I can't stop the nightmare
Have mercy on me
