No, don't wanna
Bring you down
It's lurking all around
Nobody knows what lies
Behind the door
All that I've seen
I can't take it anymore

Living and dying, loving
And hating
(I will show you)
Look on the other side
Living and dying, loving
And hating (take my hand)
Just searching fora sign

Fly away, through
Another day
All the sorrows fade
Time will heal any
Pain you feel
Just fly away

No, no way we're
Looking back
Believe me that's a fact

Who do we blame when
Nothing is left to say
Always the same when no
One gives a damm
