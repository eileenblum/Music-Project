Thru the gates
Of time
Secrets were
Left behind
Salves with terror
In their eyes

Darkness engulfing
The light
Visions of fire
In the sky

Chains, pain, blood
It's the face of
Madness
Screams of hell
From the gates
Of madness

Where are the Gods
And holy lands
Colliding the future
With the past

Help somebody let
Me out
