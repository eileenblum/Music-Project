[Humble Pie cover]

I don't need no doctor,
cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor,
cause I know what's ailing me
All I need is my baby,
you don't know why I'm in misery

I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor,
my prescription tells me that
I don't need no doctor,
my prescription tells me that
All I need is my baby,
you don't know why I'm in misery

I don't need no doctor,
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor,
I don't need no doctor

Well the doctor said I need rest ooh ooh
He put me on the critical list ooh ooh
Keeping me safe from harm ooh ooh
All I need is her sweet charm ooh ooh
He gave me a medicated lotion,
that wouldn't do
Ooh, yeah my emotion, oh yeah,
no doctor no

I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor
