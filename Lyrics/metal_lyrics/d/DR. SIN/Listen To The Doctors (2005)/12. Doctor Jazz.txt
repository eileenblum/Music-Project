[King J. Oliver cover]

Hello central give me doctor jazz
He's got what I need, I'll say he has
When the world goes wrong and I've got the blues
He's the guy who makes me put on both my dancin' shoes

The more I get, the more I want it soon
I see doctor jazz in all my dreams
When I'm in trouble bounds are mixed
He's the guy who gets me fixed
Hello central give me doctor jazz
