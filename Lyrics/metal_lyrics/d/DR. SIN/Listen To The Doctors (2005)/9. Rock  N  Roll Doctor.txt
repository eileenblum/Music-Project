[Black Sabbath cover]

Well I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world
and it's hang ups
Gonna get myself together, take a ride down town
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
I gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away

He makes me happy when
I'm feeling down, yeah
Takes away my worry takes away my frown
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
I gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away

If you wanna feel groovy give
the doctor a call, yeah
Doctor rock will help you anytime at all
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
Gotta see my rock 'n' roll doctor
I gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away
Ah right away
Now gonna blow me away
Ah right away, ooh yeah yeah,
right away
Now gonna blow me away
Ah right away, ooh yeah,
ooh yeah, right away
Ooh yeah, ooh
