[UFO cover]

Doctor, doctor, please,
don't you know I'm going fast.
Doctor, doctor, please,
don't you know I just can't last
She walked up to me and
really stole my heart
And then she started to
take my body apart

Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor, doctor, please,
don't you know I just can't last.
Doctor, doctor, please,
don't you know I'm going fast
It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
That's not a situation for
a nervous boy

Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor, doctor, please,
don't you know I'm going fast.
Doctor, doctor, please,
don't you know I just can't last
But you look so angry as
I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength,
and I can't take any more

Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
