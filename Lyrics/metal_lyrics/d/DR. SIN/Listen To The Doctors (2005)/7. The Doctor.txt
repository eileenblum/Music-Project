[Doobie Brothers cover]

Well, I'm a man who lives in the city,
I'm a man who lives in the street.
From F.L.A., up to Frisco Bay,
and everywhere in between.

Coast to coast there's a question
everybody's always askin' me.
People want to know everywhere I go;
what can the answer be?

I tell 'em, music is the doctor,
makes you feel like you want to.
You gotta listen to the doctor,
just like you ought to.
Music is the doctor of my soul.

Well it seems that when I travel,
and I'm out there on the road,
the freedom I need is the freedom I leave
in my good time rock and roll.

There's a healing in those guitars,
and a spirit in the song.
No matter what condition your rhythm is in,
the message goes on and on.

Music is the doctor,
makes you feel like you want to.
So, listen to the doctor, just like you ought to.
I said music is the doctor of my soul.

If you've ever wondered just
how to shake your blues.
Just follow this prescription,
and get the cure for what is
ailin' you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Music is the doctor, feel like you want to.
Listen to the doctor just like you ought to.
Music is the doctor of my soul.

Music is the doctor,
makes you feel like you want to.
You gotta listen to the doctor
just like you ought to.
Music is the doctor of my soul.
