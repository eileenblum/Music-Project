Time and time again
We find we're in
This far too deep

Gotta get on
Gotta get on
Gotta get on
To some place I'll be safe
Won't someone protect me

Breakdown
What's happening to me
Breakdown
I am falling into three

Emotional Catastrophe
Emotional Catastrophe
Emotional Catastrophe
Emotional Catastrophe

Days and days go by
Without a single
Reason why

Gotta get on
Gotta get on
Gotta get on
Life's hanging in a thread
Won't someone protect me
