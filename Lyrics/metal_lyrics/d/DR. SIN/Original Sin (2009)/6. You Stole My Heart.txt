When I saw you for the first time
I felt my heartbeat growing stronger
You came to me just like a vision of hope
And I knew we'd be together somehow

You gotta know
You're all I want
Only you make me feel
I don't have to die
To go to heaven

Baby, baby, you know I need you
Just like I need the air I breathe

You changed my life
You woke up my feelings
I never knew love, I was blind
Now I see that
You stole my heart

Anytime you're not right next to me
I'm so afraid you'll stay away
There is no way to go easy with love
It can be so dangerous
But it's time I must try

You gotta know
You're all I want
Only you make me feel
I don't have to die
To go to heaven
