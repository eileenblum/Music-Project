I like the way, she pumps her hips
I like the way, she wets her lips
I like the way, she spikes her
heels

And all the looks that
Dirty woman steals

Like from the pages from some dirty magazine
She struts her stuff hoping she will be seen
She doesn't care about her sad reputation
She's a dirty women
Oh! Yeah
Alright
She's a dirty women

She's not afraid of men who must touch
She's not afraid that they might want too much
But she's afraid of an innocent kiss
For fear of falling in love

I like the way, she makes it last
I like the way, she likes it fast
I like the way, she paints her face
And all the games that dirty woman plays

Like from the pages from some dirty magazine
She struts her stuff hoping she will be seen
She doesn't care about her sad reputation
She's a dirty women
Oh! Yeah
Alright
She's a dirty women
Mine, yeah!
Come on over baby
She's a dirty woman
