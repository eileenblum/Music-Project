Crawlin' on all fours through the mean streets
Headin' downtown
Craving for some fresh meat
Caught by the call of the night

Howlin' in the shadows
Waitin' for the right time
Searchin' for a victim
Hungry for love

And you know what kind of love
I'm talkin' about

She slip through the dark, played the part of the
innocent prey
Trading on her good looks
Oh she was drivin' me wild

It's almost midnight
I hear the cry of action
And here she comes all alone
dodging moonlight
It's just an act of passion
She's not alone anymore

Acting like a mad dog
I should be locked in a cage
I can't control
When my needs drive me to this rage
