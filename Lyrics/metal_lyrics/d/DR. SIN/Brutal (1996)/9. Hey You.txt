You told me that
You're all alone
And feeling bad, bad to the bone

You must keep it up
No matter what they do
If you think men don't cry
You must be blind

You've been a prisoner for your whole life
You cannot even remember your name

Hey you! Don't say to me - you've never been a fool
Never cry, never lie - Have you ever been afraid to die
Hey you! Sometimes it's hard, it's hard
To face the truth - It almost always brings us pain
Have you ever felt this pain before

You shook my hand - You looked away
Are you afraid? Or maybe shy
To contemplate your own mistakes
You've been a victim of your fate
You're the only one - Who can really help yourself
