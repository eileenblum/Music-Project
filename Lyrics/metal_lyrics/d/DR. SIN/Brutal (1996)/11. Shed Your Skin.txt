Our time has come
to take a journey
Back to the core of your own creation
Far beyond this world of exploitation
They steal our souls and then
Expose it all for view

An open mind
Will set your free
A potent dose of reality
Peel of the layers
To what's within
It's time for you to shed your skin

In this netherworld
There is nothing sacred
All our knowledge just confirms
We are fools
Faith and trust replaced by greed and money
Our bodies numb
After it all it's through

An open mind
Will set your free
A potent dose of reality
Peel of the layers
To what's within
It's time for you to
Shed your skin

We're fools
Slowly slipping
The world is slipping away
