I live inside a world of my design
I wouldn't think of living any other way
As least I know that what I have is mine
No matter how you try to take it
Sometimes I feel confused
Rejected and refused
But I still choose to be
Isolated

I rather live my life by my own rules
Then by into the lie that I should play along
I reinvent myself at risk of ridicule
Still is my life and I will live it

Sometimes I feel confused
Rejected and refused
But I still choose to be
Isolated

Would you even care?
If I wasn't who I was and
I was what you wanted me to be...

Oh! This is my life
Not your life
