In my life I took so many chances
I always said I wasn't scared to die
Now I'm here, down in the trenches
Looking death between the eyes

Good times and not so good
I had it all - And I remember like it was today
Now I will have
to leave it all behind

Oh Lord! Tell me what to do
God have mercy on me

Oh Lord! Show me the way
Give me a chance to carry on

Green grass, springtime, I had a dog once
My mother's eyes, I broke my leg - Saw the world
I made love - Joined the army, I got shot

Hard times and struggle and arguments
Who won? It doesn't really matter now -
Now there's no one who can help me out

Oh Lord! Tell me what to do
God have mercy on me

Oh Lord! Show mw the way
Give me the chance to carry on

Down in the trenches
