Biding my time walking down the street
When I heard a stranger say my name
I turned around and saw a strange little lady
And she looked into my eyes just like she knew me
Hey! Is this a put on?

She start talkin' bout my life
Secrets that nobody else could know
She told me to listen to her advice
Told me she was sent here to protect me

Since she said my name
I've never been the same

Now I'm on a mission
Now I'm on a journey
Because she made me see
What I was meant to do
Listen to your angel
To your inner voices
You are meant to see
What you are meant to be

Hey! This ain't a put on
Hey! I've got an angel
