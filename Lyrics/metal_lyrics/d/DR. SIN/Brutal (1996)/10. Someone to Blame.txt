You really don't scare me
Because it's easy to see
That you don't have what it takes
To back it up
You think I'm gonna freeze
And beg you don't hurt me please
If you think that
You better think again

No matter how much you pry
No matter how hard you try
You will never bring me to your level

You wanna take a stand
You just don't understand
That you are fighting the wrong war

Can't let it go - Can't take it slow
Don't wanna sink to your plane
I can let it go - I won't sink that low
You just want someone to blame

You really don't scare me
Because it's easy to see
That you don't have what it takes
To back it up
You think I'm gonna freeze
And beg you don't hurt me please
If you think that
You better think again

Can't let it go
Can't take it slow
You just can't keep it contained

I can let it go
I won't sink that low
Can't get it through your thick brain

Can't you be wrong
Don't wanna take you on
Don't wanna sink to your plane

Can't let it go
Can't take it slow
Friend there's nothing to gain

I can let it go
Don't have to sink so low
How can I make it more plain
