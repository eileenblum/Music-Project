Born on my back
By the side of the tracks
I was a scrappy little kid
I sat at the knees of beggars and thieves
I knew exactly what they did, shame

Really kinda sad
I never knew how bad it was

I came of age
Broke off my cage
I said I never would go back, no

But deep within
I'm still a child of sin
From the wrong side of the tracks, shame

Everywhere I roam
I carry my old home - with me
Child of sin

I've got no hope - No master to follow
Scar on my soul - That never can heal
Living on the dark - No salvation
Find a way out, can't find a way out - No way out
