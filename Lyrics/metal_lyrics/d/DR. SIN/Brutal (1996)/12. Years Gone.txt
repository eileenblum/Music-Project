Please, forgive me
I'm not the man I used to be anymore
Please believe me
I've been running around from town to town
Just to settle my score

How many times can you lose someone
How many nights will we write a sad song
Years gone

Please receive me
So many years are gone
You don't know me anymore
I relate to you
I know it's
hard to know someone
Who has changed so much

How many times will we close the door
There's nothing left
That we had before

Hang on, don't you lose it
Write it off
That's the way it is
Give up you gotta choose it
Today or yesterday
