Filling these sidewalks
Everyday after five
Choking for space
Are they dead or alive
Looking past faces
Are they human or beast
Dancing with the devil
They're as good as the deceased

Crawling like snakes
Living like slaves
It's the death of the spirit
A deafening sound
Listen to the silent scream

Millions of people
It's the life on the brink
Everyone's shouting
Can't hear yourself think
A parade of confusion
Of loss and regret
Sold out for convenience
They deserve what they get

Crawling like snakes
Living like slaves
I hear the people they cry with no sound
I hear the silent scream
