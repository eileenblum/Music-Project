I should have known she was a pyro
She really loves to light the fire

She loves to watch it burn
Turns on when
the pretty flames destroy
Her little boy melting all his hopes

They always told me not to play with fire
They always said I was a very live wire

I should have known that she would burn me
It's not as if they didn't warn me

I just can't help myself
Helpless like a fragile moth to flame
She calls my name - I'm burning a trail

They always told me not to play with fire
They always said I was a very live wire
