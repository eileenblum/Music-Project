I still remember my first flight
The mighty Zeppelin blew my mind
I saw the ocean over the hills
I saw the lnd of ice and snow

Valhalla, I am coming
Oh! My soul
Felt like a stairway to heaven

Hey! Hey! Mama! Gonna make you groove
Cause the song remains the same
Hear me, friends it's a celebration!
With a whole, a whole lotta love

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you
All of my love
Whole lotta love to you

I wanna thank you Gods of Rock!
I wanna thank you

Oh! I'm singing in the sunshine
Oh! I'm laughing in te rain
Oh! Let the music be your master
Oh! Let your spirit whit a song

Valhalla, I am coming Oh!
My soul
Felt like a stairway to heaven

Hey! Hey! Mama! Gonna make you groove
Cause the song remains the same
Hear me, friends it's a celebration!
With a whole, a whole lotta love

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you
All of my love
Whole lotta love to you

I wanna thank you Gods of Rock!
