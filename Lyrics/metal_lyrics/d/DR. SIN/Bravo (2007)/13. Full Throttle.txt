---"We're talking fucking rock 'n' roll yeah"---

Ignition baby, it feels alright
The egine is rcking, it's time to roll

The iron dragon is spitting fire on the road
I just can't help, it warms my soul
I make myself at home, wherever I may roam
I feel the fire burning cold

The lonely rider hits the road
Trying to find himself again
He fights his demons on his horse of steel
He's running like the wind
His destiny on his wheels
Each mile leaves the world behind
Makes the past fade away

It's fading away

I feel the wind babe, it feels so good
I love the dust, I love the steam

The iron dragon is spitting fire on the road
I just can't help, it warms my soul
I make myself at home, wherever I may roam
I feel the fire burning cold

The lonely rider hits the road
Trying to find himself again
He fights his demons on his horse of steel
He's at full throttle going fast
Another town, another place
He's running like the wind
His destiny on his wheels
Each mile leaves the world behind
Makes the past fade away

It's fading away

The lonely rider hits the road
Trying to find himself again
He fights his demons on his horse of steel
He's running like the wind
His destiny on his wheels
Each mile leaves the world behind
Makes the past fade away

It's fading away
