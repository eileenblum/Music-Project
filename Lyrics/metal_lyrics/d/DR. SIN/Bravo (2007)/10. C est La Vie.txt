Still feel the rain and the wind in my face
In the streets of Paris
The glamour and lights brought tears to my eyes
As the tower was pointing the sky
All the beauty of this paradise
Was healing the pain I was feeling inside
Suddenly all th battles I've lost
Started to make sense and I heard a voice

C'est La Vie
C'est La Vie

A magical moon reflected on the river
Inspider me to fight for my dreams once again
I've been carryng the weight of my past for too long
But the bells broke the silence to tell I was wrong

Eventually we shall fall
And when it happens we brave and rise

C'est La Vie
C'est La Vie

C'est La Vie
