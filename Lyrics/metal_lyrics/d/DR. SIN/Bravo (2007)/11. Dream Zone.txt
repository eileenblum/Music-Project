Free your mind now
Let yourself go
Free your mind
Now hear this
How I wish
I wish that I could Fly
Fly through the opens sky
If i could I'd be traveling through time
Maybe change history

Like a pioneer
Discovering new lands
Like a spaceship
Landing on the moon
I've created my world
I changed my life
By dreaming

In the desert will rain
Threes will grow from the sand
No more hunger or pain
Love will rule every day

I can live
In the world of make-believe
Won't you come along with me?
If I could know the secrets of the sea
What a dream that would be

Like a pioneer
Discovering new lands
Like a spaceship
Landing on the moon
I've created my world
I changed my life
By dreaming

In the desert will rain
Threes will grow from the sand
No more hunger or pain
Love will rule every day

Like a pioneer
Discovring new lands
Like a spaceship
Landing on the moon
