A brand new day
The same old feeling deep inside
I see the world like fire and ice
I work my balls off
My hair is turning grey
Sometimes I feel that I a going insane

Life is crazy, life is just so crazy
It will take you there or bring you down
It's amazing, how just llife is crazy
It could be heaven or could be hell

No time, 
Can't find
Too hard, 
No way
Can't do 
Anymore
Nevermind
No job
No fun, 
Don't stop
Can't run, 
Can't hide
Go away, 
Make my day

We learned to walk
We learned to talk and after all
We never learned when to hear and shut up
I'm sightly mad
I'm getting fat
It feels so bad
Let me tell you how I feel about life

Life is crazy, life is just so crazy
It will take you there or bring you down
It's amazing, how just llife is crazy
It could be heaven or could be hell

Life is crazy
So damn crazy
