So many things to do
So many places t go
So many wonders in this world
That I might never know
It feels like a very short time
To do it all I want
It feels like it's not enough
I want it more and more

Follow my hart every single day
My life is always on the road
Still have a long way t go
The fortune leads the way
Nothing last forever
Is now or maybe never
Let it rock
Let it roll

Many things to remember
So many to forget

I wanna live the best way I can
Believe me, I want it all
No time to waste
Cause nothing else matters
Nothing is worse than regrets

I live the best way I can
Cause nothing is worse than regrets

Come on
Oh yeah

I wanna live the best way I can
Believe me, I want it all
No time to waste
Cause nothing else matters
Nothing is worse than regrets

I live the best that I can
Cause nothing is worse than regrets

I will 
Live my life the best way I can
Live my life the best way I can
Live my life the best way I can
