Watch out, legions are marching in
Merciful warriors, ready to conquer
Seeking nothing but victory

Hail Caesar, hail
Hail Caesar, hail

Look out, it's useless to resist
They'll make you weak, under siege
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide

Hail Caesar, hail
Hail Caesar, hail

They're gonna burn it down, they'll spare no one
Fight back against the gods of war
Strike back, and let them taste your sword

Hail Caesar, hail
Hail Caesar, hail

We might die tonight
Like warriors

Fight back against the gods of war
Strike back, and let them taste your sword
