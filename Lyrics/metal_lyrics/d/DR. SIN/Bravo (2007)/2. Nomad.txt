Who's that old man?
Walking on the lonely road
Going from town to town
And the wonders
Standing at the crossroad
Destination nowhere

No one knows what he thinks
No oe cares how he feels
No one shows him no respect
No one gives a damn
He doesn't care what people think
He doesn't mind if they don't care
How he owns a heart of stone
He doesn't give a shit

Many friends, many lovers
May memories starting to fade
Clock is ticking, time is short
He will just keep going his way

No one knows his name
No oe knows him

No one knows what he thinks
No oe cares how he feels
No one shows him no respect
No one gives a damn

Like a riddle, no one knows his past
The fact is no one cares
Tha man and his dog
Will be forever friends
Under the sun under the rain

No one feels his pain
No one feels his pain

He doesn't care what people think
He doesn't mind if they don't care
How he owns a heart of stone
He doesen't give a shit
