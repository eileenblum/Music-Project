Girl! Leave it all behind
Cause I can see it in your eyes
Just give us another try
I can't see your crying
I can't stay away from you
We can work it out
Cause we can't let it die

Take my hand, I'll lead the way
Open your heart, don't be afraid
We had it all, now I can see
As you once said, we were mean to be
You know, I'll never let you down
So think it over
This time we're gonna make it right
So think it over

How can I tell you babe?
But I don't think we really tried
Just because of our pride
All I know is we were wrong
And all your tears have been dried
Just search inside your heart
You'll see, our love never died

Take my hand, I'll lead the way
Open your heart, don't be afraid
We had it all, now I can see
As you once said, we were mean to be
You know, I'll never let you down
So think it over
This time we're gonna make it right
So think it over

We've been alone for so long
I just can't take it anymore
And I know that we will make it work out anyhow
No one can tell us wat is good or bad
It's up to us to decide
Our love is stronger than the things that we have said
and done
