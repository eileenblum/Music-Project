Step by step I carry on
And I don't care if I am wrong
I just follow my heart
That's a good way to start

I am not afraid I will make my fate
I'm learning with my mistakes
I am not afraid cause it's never late

No one will tell me what to do
No matter what I should be going through
It's never late, you see
As long as you are free
To live your life the way you want to

You know you're going the wrong way
When you're not living your own way
Freedom is a state of mind
A door to a new world
A brand nem universe
That will change your life

Take your chances every day
Never listen what they say
Cause they don't really mind
When you're left behind

I am not afraid I will make my fate
I'm learning with my mistakes
I am not afraid cause it's never late

No one will tell me what to do
No matter what I should be going through
It's never late, you see
As long as you are free
To live your life the way you want to

You know you're going the wrong way
When you're not living your own way
Freedom is a state of mind
A door to a new world
A brand nem universe
That will change your life

You know you're going the wrong way
When you're not living your own way
Freedom is a state of mind
A door to a new world
A brand nem universe
That will change your life
