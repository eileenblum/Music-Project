It's a crazy kind of game
Are you willing to play?
Every single day
Troubles crossing our way
It feels like we're locked in a cage
We see love, we see hate
What is real what is fake?
It's up to you to win or lose

Watch for the signs
They're everywhere
Surrouding us lightning the path
You're aiming so high
No time for mistakes
Cause tomorrow depends on today

You must believe in yourself

Watch for the signs
Don't let anyone make you afraid

You must believe in yourself

You have to take care
Life is not fair
So you better beware
Nobody knows you when you're down down down
It doesen't matter what you think
You have to face the fact
You're on your own so carry on

Watch for the signs
They're everywhere
Surrouding us lightning the path
You're aiming so high
No time for mistakes
Cause tomorrow depends on today

You must believe in yourself

Watch for the signs
Don't let anyone make you afraid

You must believe in yourself

Come on
Oh

Watch for the signs
Yeah
Watch for the signs
Yeah
