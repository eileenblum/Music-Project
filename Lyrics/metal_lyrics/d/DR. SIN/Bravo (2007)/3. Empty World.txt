I'm living on a empty world
The sorrow has never set me free
Tha rain keeps falling over me
I'm facing my insanity

My heart is aching
My hops are fading
I never felt so down
My knees are bleeding
Oh God please hear me
Please take away my pain

My life is like a empty book
The agony has ruled my days
The echoes of my moyher's voice
Still growing deep inside of me

My heart is aching
My hops are fading
I never felt so down
My knees are bleeding
Oh God please hear me
Please take away my pain
