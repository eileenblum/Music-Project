---"There's one thing about life you got to know: You learn how to live, you learn how to die.
Fuck
No philosophy
No dead ends
We know what you want"---

He was standing alone
Feeling so cold
With no hope in his soul
Trying to find
A way to survive
Or a reason to fight

He's fighting for nothing
An he can't really understand
How can someone just decide who is right who is wrong
His hands are shaking
He can't breath can't feel anithing
His blood is so cold and his wounds just don't hurt animore

The scars of the war
Will never heal
Won't leave him behind
No matter who lives no matter who dies
He's just killing himself

He's hiding secrets
That he would never tell
His spirit is broken
He can't face himself

He's just a pupet
He's under control
He doesen't have any will on his own
He doesen't remember
What he had back home
He still doesen't know
Why he's fighting and what for?
