Billions of people screaming for help
They are just a perfect prey
They'd believe every word that they say
Cause they're hoping to be save
They wanna fave you under control
Who is for real? How can we know?
They really want you to be their flock
Telling how to walk, how to talk

How does it feel?
To fool the innocent
How can you sleep?
When you're drowning in sin

You live like a king
Made a fortune playing God
How do you feel?
Now that you're soul has been sold
All that they do is lie every day
It doesen't matter how hard you pray
You're not gonna win, it's useless to play
You better beare that's all I can say
They're blinding themselves when you are in pain
Meanwhile they're drinking good wine and champagne
They're always trying to numb in your brain
It's the most important part of their plain

How does it feel?
To fool the innocent
How can you sleep?
When you're drowning in sin

You live like a king
Made a fortune playing God
How do you feel?
Now that you're soul has been sold
