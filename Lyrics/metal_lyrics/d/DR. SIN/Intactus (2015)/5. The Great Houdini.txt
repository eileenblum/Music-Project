A mind in chains
A master of illusion
The king of tricks, scandals and confusions
Cheating death
He carried all of our fear on his shoulder
No limits! A life wrapped in mystery

Ladies and gentlemen, the great Houdini
Skyscrapers, water and ice, handcuffs, buried alive!

Heâs gonna escape right before your eyes
Hold your breath, heâs defying death!
Straight jacket, Chinese torture cell!

Ladies and gentlemen,
The great Houdini
Skyscrapers, water and ice
Handcuffs, buried alive

Behind the curtain, behind the scene
A mysterious man
(Ladies and gentlemen! The great Houdini!)
âMy brain is the key, that sets my mind freeâ

Skyscrapers, water and ice
Handcuffs, buried alive
