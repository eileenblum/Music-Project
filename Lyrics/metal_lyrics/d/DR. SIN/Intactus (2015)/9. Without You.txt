The radio is playing our song
I open my eyes
I see an empty home
I'm falling apart
Without you
Oh, I'm falling apart
Without you

I tried to fool myself
Pretending I was strong
Now I know
I had it all
And now it's gone

I'm falling apart
Without you
Oh, I'm falling apart
Without you

I think it's too late
You're may be
A thousand miles away
Tears are falling
It's so hard to carry on
I feel so stupid
How could I let you go
I wish I could go back in time
And make things right

Save me!
Save me, love!
I just can't take another day
In this lonely winding road
Babe you need to save me
Save me love!
I just can't take another day
In this lonely winding road!
I wish that I could save our love
I wish that I could save our love

I wish that I could find a way
To carry on
And fix all my mistakes, my love
Oh, how I wish

Save me!
Save me, love!
I just can't take another day
In this lonely winding road
Babe you need to save me
Save me love!
I just can't take another day
In this lonely winding road!
I wish that I could save our love
I wish that I could save our love
