I don't care if you leave me honey
You can take the car
The house and the money

You drove me crazy
You drove me nuts
What once was blessed
Now is cursed

Set me free
I want out
Set me free

You have killed all my dreams
Love wasn't enough
You crazy bitch
A living nightmare, a living hell
I had enough! I'll save myself

Set me free
I want out
Set me free
I'll save myself
