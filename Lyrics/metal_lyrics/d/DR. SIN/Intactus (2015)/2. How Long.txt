How long
Are we gonna live on the edge?
How long
Will we be part of this trash?
How long
Are they gonna be running the show?
How long
Will we eat everything that they throw?

Living like slaves, dreams far away
Here we go again, to face another day

Sign of the times
Living the lie
Wondering why
Weâre so afraid to fight

How long
Are we gonna live on the edge?
How long
Will we be part of this trash?
How long
Are they gonna be running the show?
How long
Will we eat everything that they throw?

Living like slaves, dreams far away
Here we go again, to face another day

How long
Are we gonna live on the edge?
How long
Will we be part of this trash?
How long
Are they gonna be running the show?
How long
Will we eat everything that they throw?
How long?
