Let me tell you a story
About this boy called James
It may sound so strange
It's a kind of a second chance
He was just a little baby
He was two years old
Started talking 'bout things
Things he could never know

His dreams came out of nowhere
Made them all so scared
His dreams came out of nowhere
Memories, nightmares

The plane is on fire
The man can't get out
The plane is on fire

Soul survivor
An innocent child
A soul of a fighter

They were shocked by his memories
Sharing facts of his past life
Somehow he's back
Back again!

His dreams came out of nowhere
Made them all so scared
His dreams came out of nowhere
Memories, nightmares

The plane is on fire
The man can't get out
The plane is on fire

How come something so tragic,
Could turn into something so magic
This is the miracle of life
Something so tragic
Something so magic
This is the miracle of life

Soul survivor
An innocent child
A soul of a fighter
Soul survivor
