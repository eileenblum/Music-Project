Lights, camera, action!
The first time I held her hand
The first time I kissed her lips
Hot dog, pop corn, I have a coke
All the magic of the big screen
All the sudden people start to scream

Everything, everything is possible
Where all the dreams come true
Seems so real
Even the impossible,where all the dreams come true

Scary, dramatic, fantastic
She gets so scared, watching Frankenstein
She holds me tight and it feels so fine
It's alive
Where all the dreams come true
Seems so real
Even the impossible, where all the dreams come true
It's alive
Where all the dreams come true
Everything, everything's possible
Where all the dreams come true
The end
