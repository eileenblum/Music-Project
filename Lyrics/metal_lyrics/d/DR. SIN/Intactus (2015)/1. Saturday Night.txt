Saturday night, get ready for action
We are going to take over this town
We are loud and we are wild
And nothing is gonna stop us now

Are you ready to rock and roll?
Letâs go crazy, letâs start the show

Feel the fire burning inside
Your mama donât like me but I donât mind
I donât care, I donât mind
Get me a beer, itâs Saturday night

Are you ready to rock and roll?
Letâs go crazy, letâs start the show
Itâs Saturday
Itâs Saturday night
Itâs Saturday, itâs Saturday night

Hey, you fuck, have you heard the news?
Tonight all hell is breaking lose
I donât care, I donât mind
Get me a beer, itâs Saturday night

Are you ready to rock and roll?
Letâs go crazy, letâs start the show
Itâs Saturday
Itâs Saturday night
Itâs Saturday, itâs Saturday night
R. O. C. K, itâs Saturday,
Let it rock
R. O. C. K, itâs Saturday
Let it roll
