Lies, lies, lies, lies
Not again
I just can't take
I wonât run, we should face it

How long will we play
The game of fools?
We are just puppets
And that's the sad truth

Now is the time
Together we fight
Fight the good fight

No lies can take my pride away
My friend
No lies can stop this fight
For freedom, oh no!

Lies, lies, lies, lies

I'm not afraid, no backing off
Now let the sun shine upon us all

How long will we play
The game of fools?
We are just puppets
And that's the sad truth

Now is the time
Together we fight
Fight the good fight

No lies can take my pride away,
My friend
No lies can stop this fight
For freedom
We'll fight the good fight the good fight
Lies!
