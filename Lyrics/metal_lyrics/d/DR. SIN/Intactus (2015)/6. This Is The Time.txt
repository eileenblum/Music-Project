Donât need to hide yourself
Donât be afraid to face your destiny
Itâs time to leave your shell
To fight your fears
And fix your broken wings

Life is like a crazy game
Donât give up before the end
We might win or we might lose
Itâs time for you to make your move

This is the time, to make all things right
Open your heart
This is the time, to fix all your life
Just open your heart

This time youâre not alone
Donât be afraid
âCause Iâm right here for you
Donât lose your faith
Itâs not too late
To make your dreams come true

Life is like a crazy game
Donât give up before the end
We might win or we might lose
Itâs time for you to make your move, yeah

This is the time, to make all things right
Open your heart
This is the time, to fix all your life
Just open your heart

Donât need to hide yourself
Donât be afraid to face your destiny
This is the time, to make all things right
Open your heart
This is the time, to fix all your life
Just open your heart
