I look up to the sky,
What a scary sight!
Formations of lights,
Shinning into the night

Now I know
We are not alone
And I don't know
If it's right or wrong
Invading our space
Leaving no trace

Aliens, in our world
Aliens, we're not alone

I think weâd better pray
We're such an easy prey

Aliens are coming
Are they white or grey

Aliens, in our world
Aliens, we're not alone

Will they come in piece?
Do they mean no harm?

Should we be pleased or prepare to war?

Aliens, in our world
Aliens, we're not alone
Aliens, aliens, aliens, aliens
