There is a time in our lives
We have to decide what to do
Inside our minds
So lost and confused
We feel like committing a crime

Seems like time is passing by
Seems like life has left me behind
Feels like trying trying so hard
I can't find, find a way out

No way out, no way out, no way out
Sometimes I cry deep down
inside - I can't find a place I'd be safe
