Sometimes I'm all alone
It's so hard to carry on
Sometimes out in the cold
Sounds like a sad song

I feel alone, down in a hole
I feel so cold, down in a hole
I feel insane, down in a hole
I just don't know what's right from wrong

I'm on my own
Down in a hole

Sometimes I'm not so strong
Feels like my mind is gone
Sometimes it's like a game
That I've been playing in vain
