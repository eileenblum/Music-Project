Last night I had a dream
To tell the truth it was really a nightmare
I was buried alive
That was so sick
So damm sick
I was paralyzed
Couldn't tell if I was dead or alive

I was scared, things happened so fast
Everybody was there no one cared
I think I'm going crazy
This place was black
I had a cold sweat
I felt so bad trying to get back
I cannot breath here

Oh no! Wake me up
Oh no! I don't belong here
Oh no! God
let me go - Oh no! Wake me up

This dream has made me blind
There was no wall to climb
Man I wish
I could fly
I felt so dizzy I felt so stoned my mind is gone
I totally lost control
