No time to waste
Get out of the way
Don't be afraid
Get ready to pay

Nothing can stop us now
We're tearing up this town
Try saying no
We'll bring you down

Oh! Can't stop me from living (dreaming)
There is (just) no right or wrong
It's burning in my soul
I've had enough

We're breaking all the rules tonight
There's no one who can tell me it's not right
There's no rules tonight

I feel the pain
These empty days
I won't give up
'Till someone pays

I just can't get enough
There ain't no backing off
I'm feeling free at last
It's time for kicking ass
