Let's say no money
Let's say no crimes
Let's say no limits
Let's say no war

Let's say no hate
Let's say no pain
Let's say no fear
Let's say no more

People why don't you scream
Fight for your dreams
Here comes the revolution
People why don't you scream
Live for your dreams
Here comes the revolution

Some promise you heaven
But give you hell
Some have no mercy
They kill for fun
You may call me a dreamer
You may think I'm fool
But I have to believe that - I'm not alone
