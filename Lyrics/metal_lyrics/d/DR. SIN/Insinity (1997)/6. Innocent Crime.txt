She's so amazing
Driving men and women crazy
Flips a coin, it doesn't matter what side is up
I guess love is blind
It doesn't matter what kind

She said her girlfriend's name was Daisy
It just left me blind and hazy
Then I realized my fantasy would come true

Am I loosing my mind
Just an innocent crime

Sweet temptation
Hot sensation
Wild creation

I was burning with desire
Cause these girls set me on fire
They really got me
under control
