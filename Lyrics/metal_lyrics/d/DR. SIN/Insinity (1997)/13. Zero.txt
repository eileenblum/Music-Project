Keep your faith in the hero
Take a look in the mirror
Some things are gonna bring you down
You're no saint, you're no sinner
Always being a believer
That's the only way he knows to survive

And he sees that
There's no way back now
I know - He's tired of being a zero
God knows - God knows he's nobody's hero

He puts his head on the pillow
Feels the pain in his soul
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He doesn't feel
like a hero - He never looks in the mirror
Cause he's afraid of what he would see
