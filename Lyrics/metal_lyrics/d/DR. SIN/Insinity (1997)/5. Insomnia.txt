He came from the streets
He's struggling to forget
But now he just can't sleep
Rolling in his bed
He's searching for the truth
Feel lost without a clue
Wasted in his room
He's always been refused

His shadow in his past
The weight on his back
He saw too much too fast
Children smoking crack
So damm hard to sleep

He never felt so sad
He knows that no one cares
Now it's too fucking late
He wrote his own fate
