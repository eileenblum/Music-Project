I woke up this morning with tears in my eyes
I just realized
That nothing has changed, nothing at all
I just don't understand
Why so much hate
So much pain
It doesn't have to be this way
So tell me now
How far can we go
I guess nobody knows but

I've been waiting every morning
I've been waiting for the day
When the real love will last forever
To make this world a better place

Most of the times I feel mankind
Pretending they're blind
Who's been fooling who
My oh my here comes the time
To let your soul be free
With a brand new song to sing

Living and learning
The world keeps turning
That's why we are here
Nothing's gonna change what I believe

So my friend
There's nothing wrong with crying
When you're down and out
Cause we're living to learn
We're learning to live
Keep searching you will find
