From the depths of the human mind
Mysteries that rule our lives
Are we free or slaves of faith?
Good and evil walk side by side

Are we evil or divine?

How can we purify our souls?
Without being in total control?
Our kind is being carved in blood
Are we blessed or are we cursed?

How many secrets, tell me father,
Lie behind the seven sins?
The world we live in, is a nightmare
Or is just a crazy dream?

Like a blind man lost in time
We could never see the light
We know what's right or wrong
But we're still singing the same old song

How many secrets, tell me father,
Lie behind the seven sins?
The world we live in, is a nightmare
Or is just a crazy dream?

Wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, gluttony

How many secrets, tell me father,
Lie behind the seven sins?
The world we live in, is a nightmare
Or is just a crazy dream?
