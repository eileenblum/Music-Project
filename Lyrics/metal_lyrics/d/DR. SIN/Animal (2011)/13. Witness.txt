Lost in the dark
Alone in the night
Trying to find my way

Sirens and screams
A shot in the dark
Someone just lost his life

Such a bad dream
Shameful display
Of our sad society

There is no wrong place
There is no wrong time
I hope i get out alive

I couldn't believe my eyes
I couldn't believe it
A witness of one more cried
Is always a victim

I can't describe
That horrible sight
I couldn't help, i cried

Violent end
Upon a poor soul
He paid the higher price

I couldn't believe my eyes
I couldn't believe it
A witness of one more cried
Is always a victim oh! yeah!

I couldn't believe my eyes
I couldn't believe it
A witness of one more cried
Is always a victim
