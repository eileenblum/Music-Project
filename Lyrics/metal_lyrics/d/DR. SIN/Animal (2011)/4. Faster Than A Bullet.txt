Take my hand, come with me

We're gonna ride, it's time to go
I just can't wait to hit the road
It's time to rock, it's time to roll
Oh yeah! it's time to rock' n roll

Heading down the highway
Speed is in my soul
I'll go faster than a bullet from a gun
Following the sun
Feels good, feels so right

Burns like fire in my soul

I feel so good and free at last
No matter if we're going east or west
I feel alive yeah!

Get out of my way, Here I go again
Get out of my way, I'm on the fast lane

Free we ride
With no worries on our minds
Free we ride
With no worries on our minds

Now I'm on the highway
Speed is in my soul
I'll go faster than a bullet from a gun
Following the sun
Feels good, feels so right

Get out of my way, Here I go again
Get out of my way, I'm on the fast lane

Free we ride
With no worries on our minds
Free we ride
With no worries on our minds
