The black smoke is clouding the sky
The flames are burning so high
So many lives are at stake

Hotter, hotter than hell
Hotter, hotter than hell

Here come the firemen
Ready to save as many as they can
Facing the fire, risking their lives again

Heroes
They are true heroes
There is no price for saving a live
Will they back home tonight?

Watch out
The roof is falling down
What's the sound?
Sounds like desparate shout

Every time the hear the bell
Like angels they get ready to fight hell
There are no strangers for them

Heroes
They are true heroes
There is no price for saving a live
Will they back home tonight?

Watch out
The roof is falling down
What's the sound?
Sounds like desparate shout
