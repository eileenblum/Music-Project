Here I go again
Every day is the same
Working like a slave
Time and time again
Stuck in the traffic jam
I am losing my mind

How could we complain?
God! how I miss those days
Innocence was left behind
Now I get insane
Thousands bills to pay
I wish I could go back in time

I'll never forget those days
Seems like yesterday
Out in the streets
Playing with the kids
Those were the best days of my life

Too much confusion
Too much pollution
Under pressure, always late
This must be a joke
I'm about to have a stroke
I am losing my mind

I'll never forget those days
Seems like yesterday
Out in the streets
Playing with the kids
Those were the best days of my life
Those were the best days of my life
Those were the best days of my life
