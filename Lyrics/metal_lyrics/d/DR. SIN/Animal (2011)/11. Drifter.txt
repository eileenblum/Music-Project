Lonely days and lonely life
Empty bottle, another fight
Life has given him many scars
Spent some time behind the bars
Just a man with a pocket full of dreams
Just a man with his guitar
Another town, another night
Another girl, a broken heart

But he'll never be alone
He has his guitar
The stage is his home
Those magic fingers can make you cry, all right!

He can play the blues all night
He can rock and roll that's right

I wish everybody could understand
Those notes had so much to say
It came from the soul
It could never go wrong

He's been a drifter all his life
He's always following the gipsy road
Another town, another night
Another girl, another broken heart

But he'll never be alone
He has his guitar
The stage is his home
Those magic fingers can make you cry, oh! Oh!
Yeah!

He can play the blues all night
He can rock and roll that's right
He can play, he can play the blues
He can rock and roll and he can blow you mind
That's right! Oh! Yeah!
He keeps rocking and rolling all night
He keeps rocking
He keeps rolling all night
Oh! All night
