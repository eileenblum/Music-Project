There's an angel in heaven
There's a voice inside my head
He's my hero forever
There is magic in the air

Like a light in the dark
Owner of a sacred heart
Bow to the king
Long live rock'n roll

Every time there's a rainbow
I can't help i start to cry
Every time there's a rainbow
I feel left on my own

There's no reason to cry
Cause his voice will never die
There'll be always a stage
But that's another page

Like a light in the dark
Owner of a sacred heart
Bow to the king
Long live rock'n roll

Every time there's a rainbow
I can't help i start to cry
Every time there's a rainbow
I feel left on my own

He's the king! long live rock'n roll!

Every time there's a rainbow
I can't help i start to cry
Every time there's a rainbow
I feel left on my own

He's the king!
He's the king!
He's the king! long live rock'n roll!
He's the king! long live rock'n roll!
