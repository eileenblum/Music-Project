So damn pretty
Looks like an angel
The way she moves
Can drive you crazy

Such a sweet voice
Such a sweet kiss
Hot legs, so sexy with the high heels
Those eyes can put on your knees
But she made my heart bleed

In her mind nothing but conspiracy
Cause she's always living in her own world
She's insane jealous of her own shadow
I tell you! Enough is enough

Can't take it anymore
I'm deleting you babe!

Yes!Yes!Yes!U r deleted
Deleted from my cell
I'm deleting you
Yes!Yes!Yes!U r deleted
Deleted from my heart
Deleted from my life

Hot legs, so sexy with the high heels
Living in her own world

Yes!Yes!Yes!U r deleted
Deleted from my cell
I'm deleting you
Yes!Yes!Yes!U r deleted
Deleted from my heart
Deleted from my life
From my life
