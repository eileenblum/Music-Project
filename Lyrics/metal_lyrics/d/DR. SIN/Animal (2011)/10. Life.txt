Ahh! lonely is the world
Ahh! it can be so sad and cold
You have nobody waiting at home
You're always crying, all your hopes are gone

Don't cry old man, no one can feel your pain
Don't cry old man get on your feet again
Don't cry old man, so high the price we pay, 'cause

Life can bring you down
Life can bring you down

Ahh! no one gives you a damn' bout you
Ahh! you're on your own, it's sad but true
You're always waiting for your dying day
Before you do something stupid, you better think again

Don't cry old man, no one can feel your pain
Don't cry old man get on your feet again
Don't cry old man, so high the price we pay, 'cause

Life can bring you down
Life can bring you down

You're just too deep into the pain
You're not to blame, don't be ashamed
There's only one thing i can say
It's never late to start again

Life can bring you down
Life can bring you down
Life can bring you down
I said life can bring you down
