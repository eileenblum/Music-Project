I'm praying lord to find a way
I'm struggling every single day
I know there must to be something better
Waiting for you
Waiting for me
Waiting for us

Life is not like it was supposed to be
It's hard and everyone can see
I know, i know, i know there must to be something better
Waiting for you
Waiting for me
Waiting for us

Learn from yesterday
Live for today
Pray for tomorrow my friend

There are many things i'd like to say
But time is short and that's a shame
And then again i find myself on my knees
Praying for you
Praying for me
Praying for us

Learn from yesterday
Live for today
Pray for tomorrow my friend

That will be the day when all pain will fade away
There's so much loch love to share
Spread the word everywhere
Have you ever let the sun shine down on you?
Have you ever let the rain wash your tears away?

Learn from yesterday
Live for today
Pray for tomorrow my friend
