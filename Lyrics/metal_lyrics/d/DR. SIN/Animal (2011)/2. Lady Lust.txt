Cannot control her desires
She's getting hot
She's on fire

Seems like she walk in flames
Her life is down in shame
She's got a dirty soul
She's got no self-control

In her mind nothing but lust
She's not someone you can trust

Seems like she walk in flames
Her life is down in shame
She's got a dirty soul
She's got no self-control

She sleeps all day
Waiting for the night
Better beware she's the queen of lies
Once you look at those pretty eyes
Will be too late, you'll be hypnotized

Seems like she walk in flames
Her life is down in shame
She's got a dirty soul
She's got no self-control
