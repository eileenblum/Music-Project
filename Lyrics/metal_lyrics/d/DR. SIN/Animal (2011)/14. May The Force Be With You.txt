If I were a Jedi
I'd respect all forms of life
If I were a Jedi
The force would be my ally
If I were a Jedi
I'd be the guardian of peace
If I were a Jedi
I'd protect the galaxy

May the force be with you
May the force be with you

Fear leads to anger
Anger leads to hate
Hate leads to suffering my friend
Once you start down the dark path
It will forever dominate your destiny
The Dark Side is seductive
Quicker and easier

May the force be with you
May the force be with you

Fight the Dark Side

May the force be with you
May the force be with you
May the force be with you
May the force be with you
