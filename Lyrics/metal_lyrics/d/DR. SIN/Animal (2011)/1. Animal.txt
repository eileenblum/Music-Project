Crazy child
Out of her mind
Crazy
On the prowl
Animal

She's just
She's eighteen and living in sin
She's so
She's so young and out of control
She's got
The beast within you know what I mean
She loves
To break the rules
she's on the lose

Crazy child
Young and wild
Crazy
On the prowl
Animal

She wants
To live as fast as she can
She is not
She's not afraid of anything
She's just
Just a bomb about to blow
She hates
She hates to be alone

Crazy
