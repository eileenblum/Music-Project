Ah! ah! remember everything you've done
Ah! ah! all your life you've been so wrong
Ah! ah! take your sit, enjoy the ride
Ah! ah! your destination, soon you'll find

You can scream and you can shout
No one can hear you now
You're on the railroad to hell
This train you cannot stop

Ah! ah! welcome to the train of pain
Ah! ah! don't you worry, you're not insane
Ah! ah! through the window passing by
Ah! ah! images of your sad life

Ah! you have to face the truth
Ah! there's nothing you can do! no, no, no!

You can scream and you can shout
No one can hear you now
You're on the railroad to hell
This train you cannot stop

Ah! ah! all your sins you can't forget
Ah! ah! there's no time for your regrets
Ah! ah! now the train is running fast
Ah! ah! the justice will be done at last

Ah! who's gonna cry for you?
Ah! there's nothing you can do! oh! no!
