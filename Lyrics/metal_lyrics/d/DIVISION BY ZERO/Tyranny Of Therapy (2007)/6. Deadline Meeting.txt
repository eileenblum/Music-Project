Hello
Nice to know you
Nice to know your other side
Hello
Nice to see you
Nice to feel you
Nice to lie

Reflection

Hello
So exciting
To discover second way

Take off your shoes
And than sit down
Be my guest
And now
I will drive you home
Home!

Place
Stone doors of your tears
Children eyes

Opening all fears
We should get back
We should know
I know you know it's wrong
To live them alone

Reflection
Other rage
Brakedown mirror's thelles

I will drive you home

I disintegrate on parts first
I'm shutting up to be a scream

Take off your shining eye
Take off your pretty face
Take off your smile and fingertips
Take off my shine

Take off your shoes
And than sit down
Be my guest
And now
I will drive you home
Home!
