I remember this time
I was running to you like a pray of fools
I must tell you this now I'm rider of truth
And I wait for you and your
And everything what is wrong
Everything what is strong
What's looks like you
I must tell you this now I'm rider of truth
And I wait for you and your

Salvation to dominate
Creation
And celebrate

And I remember this time
Somewhere deep in your mind
Bodies like a food
You know your meaning of life
Second chance you want to try
But I wait for you

Hide screaming child
You think I'm blind
But I'm not
You think I'm blind you think I'm alive
But I'm not
