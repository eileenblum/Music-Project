Flame of soul
Hidden scream
Shadows making day
Eye for eye
Eye for death escape from this madness
I see you run I see your scare
Tell me what can I do
To hold you here to change your mind
To make my dreams come true... set me free!

Asking sky
Asking deep
Asking painter of light where is the way where I should go
So dark and coldest night
Take my hand
And look around
Close my eyes and open mind
Show me the flower
Show me the way tell what can I do to make you stay
Make you stay!!!

Wait
Wait I look at you
I wish you'd stay
And I hope you know it's true
Hey wait don't you want to know
For you I lost my mind
For you I lost my soul

You have to believe in heavenly dream of truth
You have to believe in heavenly dream of new

So baby just wait let me look at you...
Don't wanna close my eyes
I just don't wanna lose you
Burn my head burn my memories burn this all burn but know
For you I lost my life
For you I lost my soul
