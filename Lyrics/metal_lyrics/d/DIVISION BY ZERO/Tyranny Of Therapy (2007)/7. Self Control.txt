Your shame
That is over
Singing rights of believe
This is not what you want
This is why you're hiding for
It's your shame and that sing of the wind

Put the man on the glass
And break the glass

Self control
Think that you've never known before
Self control
Think of you past
You hate it so
Deep in your heart and right to your eyes
They never forget
So I am your self control in me

I can show you how to failed
I can show you that place where the angels fall down
Down to the ground
On your face
To the slush
Of this shame

Empty
Craving of those wet eyes
So blind
Can't see colours and shine
Wings of angel
Can't take your life
Poison's arrow deep in my heart

Juice of those smile stuck to green head
You like it so
Gravity and sweat secretly feelings
Hiding voice
Evolution of self revolution
Don't blame me for it
Prologue is clear
Will You try to understand?
