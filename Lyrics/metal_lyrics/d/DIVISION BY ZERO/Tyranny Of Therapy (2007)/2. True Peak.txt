I'm asking you God what's your name?
I was asking so many times
The truth is... you didn't answer me
Why God? I just want to know your name!
Skies
Fear
Believe in your lies!

I'm leaving you
I've got to go and find your real name
Broken truth
Blinding eyes and pressure hidden somewhere

To see your light
To see your smile
See this safety warm around you
To see the light and see the smile...

This is not your God you stupid human
He is your slavery
I'll tell you everything about his plans...
I'll tell you his name
Right now!

So... God?
You want to say something?
Naked and faded as me and my life
If you want to say something I'm bagging you... shut up!
Coming sun and better life
Fears and death end of lies
Simple words so hard to find
But I found

See the perfect blade of knife
See the power of my mind
All the stones
They know my name
But not you... my friend
