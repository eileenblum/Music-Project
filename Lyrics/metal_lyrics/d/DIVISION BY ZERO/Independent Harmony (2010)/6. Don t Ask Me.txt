So whatever happened to you
Why did you came to me alone
Without your father
Without friends
Deep in your eyes I see pain

Donât ask me why youâre still alive
Itâs not my problem, not my business, not my time
Donât ask me why youâre still here
I donât wanna know so donât ask me

Why all this world has to be blind?
Donât ask me
Looking for god and tears of his crying
Donât ask me
You are the death master of night
Donât ask me
Take me away, Iâm so sad

Iâm only dust man donât you know
Iâm cleaning this world, thatâs my job not my blame
Wrong guy you asking all the time
I donât know the answer my god

Donât ask me why youâre still alive
Itâs not my problem, not my business, not my time
Donât ask me why youâre still here
I donât wanna know so donât ask me
