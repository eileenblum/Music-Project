Try to hold it keep it to yourself
Trust me take her sheâs your only friend

She's alive, she's the one who loves you
Independentâs mind
Still watching you

World around cannot see her beauty
Inspirations stuck in you

She is the wind of our life
She's coming without praying
Free as wind and bird and stars
And ready everywhere

So if you try keep it to yourself
Trust me, trust me, trust me

She is the hope of our life
She's coming without praying
Free as wind and bird and stars
And ready everywhere

She is the wind of our life
She's coming without praying
Free as wind and bird and stars
She's ready everywhere

Remember you have to keep your harmony
And care, she must survive in your head
Softly sheâs your only friend, you have to be sure
That sheâll never go away
Care, she must survive, you have to be sure
Because chaos, chaos will come
Because chaos will come

Don't fool yourself
I'm hurry
Independence past

Look at me, Iâm the chaos and Iâm so real
Look at me, Iâm the chaos, message is clear

Look at me, Iâm the chaos and Iâm so real
Look at me, Iâm the chaos and Iâm so real, so real, so real
Look at me
