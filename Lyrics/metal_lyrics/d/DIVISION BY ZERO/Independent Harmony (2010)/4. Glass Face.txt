Easy, take just deep breath you must leave
And I hope youâre return
In this day I am holding your hand
Will be good thatâs not the end

And your cold eyes, they invite me to fly
With you all the time again
And your glass face showing me other side
They invite me for dance, for die

So sorry
We have failed this life again
Donât worry,
We can change our faith my friend

Was so good, was so great until this time to the sickness bend
Stop the world, all the clocks are falling down
Glass on your face building remind

And your cold eyes, they invite me to fly
With you all the time again
And your glass face showing me other side
They invite me for dance, for die

Scared panic and fear, panic and death my old friends with me
No, thatâs not your fault
I was drunk and too stupid to see thatâs really wrong

Scared and falling down, weâre dancing between the glass
Say, speak to me now, open your eyes, donât die
Say we failed again
Hey now I have to find someone new for my dance
