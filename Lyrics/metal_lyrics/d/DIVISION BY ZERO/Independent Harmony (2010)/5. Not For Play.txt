Hard to go somewhere if every thoughts came to the side of me
And weâre always looking for that we want and what we need

Only you and me

Remember to be my best friend
Who loves me to death and for free
Will give me that sure thatâs not just stupid game

Not for play
You and me

Only you and me
Only you and me
