Falling down, from nowhere and for hope
Hope to find the other kind of friend
Donât even try to hide âcause every move they know
Watch your back they failed right to your door
Yeah

Intruders, they came for us to know names to know our models
Intruders, they want to know all of your dreams and all of your hope
Intruder, you are so cute
One moment âcause I know you

Starting day with you eating your breakfast drinking your juice
All the day working hard and so as you stressing to
Big black eyes behind mask hiding as their skin so green
Copy your life and your style to be like you and to be you

Intruder, you are so cute
One moment âcause I know you

Summer fresh and wicked games
Not so true friends hiding smile but everything is great
You want to trust, you want to taste life
Itâs wrong the way you lose your way
Youâre trying to be great, someone talks to you
You wanna be cool nice fresh fucking great itâs you
Drinking too much, smoking too much, waking in the morning feeling hurt in your butt

Intruder, you are so cute
One moment âcause I know you
