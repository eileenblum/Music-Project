So cold, so deep inside that body
Iâve never heard that voice of me
War inside, war inside my body
Iâm sleeping now, so help me please

Wake me up on your shoulders
Wake me up before death will come for me
Wake me up on your shoulders
Wake me up before Iâll..

Die inside that nature in that faith of century
Cheating all around us for godâs benediction

Cheating all around us for godâs benediction

Wake me up on your shoulders
Wake me up before death will come for me
Wake me up on your shoulders
Wake me up before Iâll..
