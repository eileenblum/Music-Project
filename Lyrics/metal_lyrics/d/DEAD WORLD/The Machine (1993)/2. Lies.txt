Standing with the sadist, dark side of the mind.
Penetrate the walls of disorder, desire I can't deny.
Pinned down by enemy cross fire, kiss your life good-bye.
Prison with walls my darling, beneath the blood red sky.
Lies...
See your sister tied down, my chaos kills her cries.
Tell me who your god is, spread legs nice and wide.
A symptom of my sickness, within my faded eyes.
Eruptive waves of violence crush your worthless lives.
Lies...
Surgical arena, twisted pit of desire.
Feel my ultraviolence lover, as you slowly die.
Car crash victim struggles, cut off at the thighs.
Ebony blood and distorted visage echo in my mind.
Lies...
