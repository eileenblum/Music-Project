He's just a face in the crowd, a nondescript man, a dim witted mouthful of lies.
Football on the TV, beer in the hand, the extent of his rational depth.
He's a god fearing man, a wife beating fuck, a vacuous flag waving fool.
Rip out his heart, feed him his dick, gut him like a hamstrung deer,
Kill, kill that man...
