A world of lies
In the shadow of ignorance
Veil of darkness
Mankind shall fall

Putrid decay
Of a slowly dying world
(death/the) sentence
Known between from nature

Humanity will crumble
Death becomes our question ...ations
H...s... in hystery
Cries to a (heart)

Where is your savior now?
(corpse) wide on concrete cross
(figure) a sense
In a past or distant future

WE  LIVE  IN  A  DEAD  WORLD.  DEAD BECAUSE YOU KILLED IT. NOT WITH WARS,
FAMINE  OR DISEASE - FOR IF ANYTHING THESE ARE BALMS TO THE EARTH. INSTEAD YOU
LEFT  YOUR SIGNATURE OF DEATH BY OVERPOPULATING THIS WORLD WITH A TEEMING MASS
OF  MINDLESS,  SEXLESS,  RACELESS  SLAVES.  YOU ABANDONED THE HIGHEST GOAL YOU
COULD  HAVE  ASPIRED  TO  - EVOLUTION - AND PUT IN ITS PLACE A FACTORY FOR THE
STUPID,  THE  IGNORANT,  THE  DESPICABLE.  AND YET YOU CLAIM WE HEAD TOWARDS A
GLORIOUS  FUTURE.  IT MAY BE FULL OF GLORY BUT THIS WILL NOT BE THE KIND WHICH
BESTOWS  BLESSINGS ON THE MEEK, FOR THEY SHALL INHERIT ONLY THE IRON HEEL. THE
RACE  WARS,  HATE  WARS  AND HOLY WARS OF THE COMING MILLEN-NIUM WILL MAKE THE
HOLOCAUSTS OF THE PAST LOOK LIKE A WALK IN THE PARK. HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE THERE
TO  FULFILL  YOUR ROLE AS VICTIM, AS DESPITE THE DELUSIONS YOU PAY LIP SERVICE
TO,  THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE AT THE CORE. YOU CAN TAKE YOUR LIBERTY, EQUALITY AND
BROTHERHOOD  AND  FLUSH  THEM DOWN THE DRAIN OF THIS SO-CALLED "CIVILIZATION".
YOUR  PROGRESS  IS A LIE AND YOUR SOCIETY AN EYESORE. YOU ARE SLAVES IN CHAINS
IN  THE  GALLEY  OF  THE  SHIP  NAMED  HUMANITY.  CALL YOURSELVES UNITED, CALL
YOURSELVES BROTHERS...
BUT  WHEN THE SHIP SINKS YOU'LL CRUSH YOUR MOST BELOVED TO DEATH IN ORDER
TO SAVE YOUR OWN DYSGENIC HIDE.
BUT  THERE  IS  ONE  NOBLE  PATH;  A  PROPER  FINISH  FOR  YOUR MISERABLE
EXISTENCE.  ADMIT  YOUR  FAILURE,  WALLOW IN THE DESPAIR. LET IT ILUMINATE THE
ONLY  WAY TO GIVE YOUR LIFE MEANING. PICK UP THE REVOLVER AND SLIDE THE BARREL
BETWEEN  YOUR  LIPS.  ENJOY THE SHARP METALLIC TASTE. WARM THE COLD STEEL WITH
YOUR  TONGUE. PRESS THE END INTO THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AND HOLD IT THERE. NOW
LET  ME  DO THE REST ... ALAS, IF ONLY YOU ALL HAD ONE COLLECTIVE MOUTH AND MY
FINGER WAS ON THAT TRIGGER.
I  WON'T  HESITATE  FOR  A  SECOND,  ALTHOUGH YOU PROBABLY DESERVE A MUCH
SLOWER  FORM  OF  EXTERMINATION. THIS WILL HURT SOMEONE, AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS
ONLY THE BEGINNING...
