Come my lord
Taste and see my scars
I'll take you to my world
to show you ... who I am
Luzifer has burnt our souls
We can't see "life" anymore
obsessed with fears

A glowing knife before my eyes
A candle lit to give her light
Blood-coloured tears drop to the ground
As she stabs her knife inside
Cold, icy winds just next myself
Where she laid there is nothing left
as I embrace her lifeless face

Are you my seignor
Please, bring me away
I'll wait on your saviour
Tears of joy and pain
