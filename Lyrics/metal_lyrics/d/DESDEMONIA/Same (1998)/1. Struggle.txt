"Hey, come to me to fullfill your dreams
Just trust and see 'cause my word is true"

Disgust is what I feel
Before those you want to kneel
Sucking every trust
To extend their lust
Rage undoes the knot
I carry in my throat
Feeding their belief

"In the far I see two silhouettes standing
there, watching me
They reach out their hands and with glancing eyes
they speak to me..."
In the far I see
