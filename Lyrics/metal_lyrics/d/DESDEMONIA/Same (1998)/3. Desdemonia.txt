Oppressed instincts
Please, let me breath
Thoughts in delirium
Blindens my sight
Ripping off my wings
Destroying every hope
Freezing resistance
Down in my hole

I'll taste your blood with revenge
Disgraced spirits, drown in lies
I damn your soulless lifes
Awaiting the day, we shall rise

A travel to nowhere with an aimless guide
Denying every hope that I have torn
