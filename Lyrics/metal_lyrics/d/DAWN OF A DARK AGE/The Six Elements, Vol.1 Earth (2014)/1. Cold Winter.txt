Cold winter it will be
The wolves are ready to return
Mount Castle Baron is the heart
Of the murder of the human by the wolves

Green becomes white
Snow as a child
All firs will cover
And your eyes are frozen

You didnât know
Youâll find yourself
Lost in a woods without view
You blind feel the wolves coming
Their cold breath
You can feel miles away
You didnât know
You would never have thought of this end

Their soft footsteps in the snow,
Bring your mind away
And the only way out
Is the battle for survival
A blind man against a wolf
Like the beasts in the Colosseum
This is not the death I choose

Oh Lord of the winter, Lord of the high mountains
If you knew that our race is evolved
But the nature will reign again and again
And she will win on those who raped and destroy

Cold winter as gone
The wolves run away
Mount Castle Baron is the witness
But this is not the death I choose
