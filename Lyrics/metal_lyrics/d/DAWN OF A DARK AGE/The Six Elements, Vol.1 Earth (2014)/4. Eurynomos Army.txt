Sunset is lost
Behind my pupils
The light turns in darkness
The freezing fog down

The Buranâs wind
Lashes the streets
Letâs start another night
Of blood and terror

Our world is sick, this Hell is real
The man has built it, to let us reign

My faithful troops
Donât leave any trace
Nobody knows about
Our glorious existence

We live like shadows among you
And dismember your meat
With our claws
With our sharp teeth

Your ego is our strength
Youâre repressed parasites
Devoted only to
The God of money

Our world is sick, this Hell is real
The man has built it, to let us reign

Damned men youâll be the slaves
Of the Eurynomos Army
And then finally
Youâll find your freedom
