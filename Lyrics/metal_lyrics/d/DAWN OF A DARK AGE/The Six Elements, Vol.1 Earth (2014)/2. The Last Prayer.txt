Darkness flows in my veins
Like a mortal poison
Like a stream through the mountains
A fog that blurs my senses

Sorrow and confusion
I feel stunned, alienated
I cannot react
My muscles are shrunken

No reaction from inside
Paralyzed, I can only scream
But itâs a silent scream
I cannot speak
Alone, chained, where am I?

The only things I can remember are
An empty life, always in pain
How long does this calvary last?
When the sunshine light will be back again?

Is this the time of my last prayer?
