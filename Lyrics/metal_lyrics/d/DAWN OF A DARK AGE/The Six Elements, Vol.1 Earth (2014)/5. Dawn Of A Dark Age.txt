The Sky, the Sea
The Sun the Moon
The rhythm of the Seasons
From thousand and thousand years

Beyond the Sky
Sailing this Sea
Men go to conquer
New slaves to sodomize

The art of war, the most beloved
Will never stop, cut off the throats
Letâs start the war, warplane and tanks
With machine gun, nuclear attack

No one can react to your frustration
Youâre the soul of the War in the frontline
The Earth...Your Heart
The Sea...Your Blood
The Wind...Your Breath
The Fire...Your Power

Your religion is the plague
To control the minds, to rape the souls
Wear your mask, murderâs eyes
Satisfied, with flowing blood

After a thousand years
The game always the same
The story doesnât teach
Nothing change

But for you, man
The Judgmentâs Day comes
Your bloody eyes
Will see the âDAWN OF A DARK AGEâ
