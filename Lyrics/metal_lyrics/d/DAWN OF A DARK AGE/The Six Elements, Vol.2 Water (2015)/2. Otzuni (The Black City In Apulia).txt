It was called the White City
And stood on âLa Murgiaâ
A fortress controlled the plain
That separated her from the sea

Olive trees and wines on its slopes
Were life for its people
For a thousand years
But the last attack was near

The fleet of the Saracens
Set out toward those shores
With six thousands warriors
Ready to burn and kill 'em all

At noon the ships could sea the coast
And the peasants were called to arms
But the legion of the Saracens
Had no rivals

The Arabian warriors
Saw the city and white walls
And gradually approaching
They burned trulli and trees

The battle in the castle
Would last a few hours
Otzuni would have
Capitulated.

At the end of the day
They reached the gates of the city
Bloodthirsty and hungry for victory
Ready for the decisive attack
The trees reduced to ashes
Rise again, like fiery ghosts
And exalting the sky and the wind
Began the rain dance to protect the walls
The clouds spitting black water
And the sky darkened painting the walls
Demons came out from hell
To defend the red lands and the community

Darkness covered everything
In the night of St.Oronzo
The silent screams were swallowed
And the black rain consumed their skin
The bloodbath of six thousand
Saracens in Apulia
The White City Otzuni
That became the Black City
