Waterâ¦the hills
Waterâ¦the sky
Waterâ¦the streams
Waterâ¦the lakes
But youâre polluted by the murder men

Waterâ¦youâre shine
Waterâ¦youâre life
Waterâ¦youâre crying
Waterâ¦you kill
When you're in danger and threatened by the power

The rain is coming
Your drops our tears
But they arenât colorless
Their color is blood

She purifiesâ¦the sins
The men commit in 1000 years
She digs black soulsâ¦deeply
Where darkness ever reigns

She falls continuously and never ending
Dancing on the old path of water and you rot slowly
She falls continuously and never ending
Dancing on the old path of water and you rot slowly in this world
