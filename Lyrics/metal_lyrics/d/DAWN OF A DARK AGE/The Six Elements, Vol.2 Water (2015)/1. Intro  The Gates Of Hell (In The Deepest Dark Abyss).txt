Your worst nightmare
This night is insane
Donât search the way
You fight the waves

Your eyes are lost
Your breath the last
Your fate is sealed
You pray a sweet death

Who will be the next one?

Cold North Sea
Frosty and wretched
Marks the border
Between God and Evil

Your bloody eyes closed
Until someone
Begins to ride your waves

The Gates of Hell
Open for you, man
That wake me up
In the middle of the night

There are no Gods
To beg forgiveness
The fate puts you
On the wrong lonely way

Plunged in darkness
Embrace his goodness
And meet his heart
In the deepest dark abyss
