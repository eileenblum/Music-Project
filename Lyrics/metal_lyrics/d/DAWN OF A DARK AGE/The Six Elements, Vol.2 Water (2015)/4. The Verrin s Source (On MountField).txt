Ch stajj an old stream
Ru nÃ©um is Verrin
La surgend on MountField
A dark place in Moliseâ¦where

In the night of San Lawrence
People sell his soul damned
Searching for a falling star
To implore absolution

Cold night but no stars
Calm reigns and full moon
Keen wind rises from North
The fear is growing

A flash, a thunder-struck
And the eyes are burning
The moon is blazing madly
The people are shocked and speechless

The night at GoatBaked
Become a nightmare
But just a prodigious place
Can redeem the eyes and the souls

Abball a Scatozza
Alla Condra Briglia
AddÃ² Sanda Lucioia
T puÃ² arzanÃ  lâuacchie
