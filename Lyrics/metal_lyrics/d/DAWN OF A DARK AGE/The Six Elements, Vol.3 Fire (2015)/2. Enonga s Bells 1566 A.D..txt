Bell
Who are you calling?
Bell
Who's the next one?
Bell 
And fear approaches
Bell
Your hate for all

You're immortal
Forged to be the Queen
Your thundering voice
Spreads in the sky!

The sinner-man is imploring you
But you shall not accept begging
Because your job cannot change
You're born to bring damned souls to the Hell

And your sound become stronger
For every soul you sentenced
Your voice doesn't carry good news
And your toll is herald of death
