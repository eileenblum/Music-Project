It will be the final twilight when the sun won't rise anymore...
The most mournful bell will strike up, the endless ring will be heard, and the crowds will be able to see the truth...
four seals are broke, delivering the four riders of might and condemnation.
War, hunger, pest, and death fly under an infernal sky darkened by so dark clouds, turbulent like the seaquakes of Poseidon.
Rich and poor, slave and lord, all mortals will see flames of fire spreading more and more on the fields and hills burning endlessly...
The one forty-four thousand feel the deepest fear because the book lies. Satan is free and on the golden throne that bleeds rejoices in victory.
The dead's blood runs, enrapturing the demons while they slaughter the twelve ancients and steal the seven last trumps from the archangels. Turning them into horns of the most devilish sound ever heard...
The dragon blows burning the book of life that is turned into dust and spread in the wind that howls, joining the laments of the dethroned dead's followers drowned to the deep wells of damnation.
The golden throne is finally destroyed and the black throne emerges in cataclysms and destruction sacramenting the eternal domination and the so waited rising of the Fallen Angel. His hordes so numerous as grains of sand united cry the victory hail, and the Armageddon battle will be over in the night...
...the eternal NIGHT FOR THE DEMON...
