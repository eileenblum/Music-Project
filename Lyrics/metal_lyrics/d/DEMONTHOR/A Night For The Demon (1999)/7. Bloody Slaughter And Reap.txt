This is the call of the wild
The Genocide Force is ready for the hunt !
We advance with the wind of damnation, so sharp as the blade of our weapons
Riding fast and indifferent to the
scalding sun or the cutting cold
Firm in trail of infernal hate obsessed by the will of exterminating the enemies

Fixed eyes by mortal violence
Blows of maces and sharpened axes
Decimate our enemies lacerated into pieces!
Crushed opposers, Empire of holocaust

Gallop tormentor...
BLOODY SLAUGHTER AND REAP

Decapitated corpses
the water of the shore
turns into blood
Intense mutilation
inhuman ferocity in the battle
Stick in the soil sceptres with the enemies heads
Vultures fly over
tracks of cadavers by the thousand!

Victory and wealth in the harvest
to carry the women and regain the gold
We knew the danger of proliferation of the enemy
tribe there wasn't time to loose...
There will be a great battle in the future, the golden hawk's battle in their iron ships and birds
But the ignorant civilization blind and fool will fall into the wise victim's trap...
