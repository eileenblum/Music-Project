The cold cleanses my soul
And reveal to me
The harmony that long was lost
It sets my spirits free
At last I feel, I feel at ease
The winter cold just grants me peace

The bitter cold is here
Light dies, I hear you cry
A dismal life appear
I live while others die

Softly caressed by silence
And by the darkest night
I make my way through shadows
Into the dying light
The pain inside, it withers away
The silence is here, it leads me astray

In the cold dead winter
My mind is free
In the grip of silence
Life is burning in me

At last I feel, I feel at ease
The winter cold just grants me peace

The bitter cold is here
Light dies, I hear you cry
A dismal life appear
I live while others die
I live while others die
