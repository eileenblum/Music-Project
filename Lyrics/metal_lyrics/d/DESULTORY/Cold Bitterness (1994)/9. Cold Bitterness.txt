Dead lines my view
A hollow gaze in black
Reflecting bitterness
In sadness life is wrapped

Eye's veil conceal
Our pain that roam inside
Days gone forever
The years has drowned in time

Life flows away before my eyes
Waiting for light, another day dies

Searching a time
Beneath the nameless days
Echoes of weeks
The void that builds our way

Open your mind, and see things through my eyes
Their dead, lost eyes, and all the bitter lives

Cold reality
Is the bitter veil
Which divides our lives
From our dying dreams

Moments in flight
Light as the winds caress
Memories, whiter
Into forgetfulness

Life flows away before my eyes
Waiting for light, another day dies

1994 Metal Blade Records
