I rise again, I am immortal
I race through time, I live and breathe only fear

My time is here, Mortals suffer for me
I rule your fate, I decide what will be

I'll devour you all
You're mortal and weak
I'll take your soul
Domination I seek

Follow me now, Follow me human fool
I stand above, Among mortals I rule

I stand above you
I seal your fate
With rage and anger
I rise in hate

Release the fury
Upon you all
My words are eternal
I rise, You fall

I'll devour you all
You're mortal and weak
