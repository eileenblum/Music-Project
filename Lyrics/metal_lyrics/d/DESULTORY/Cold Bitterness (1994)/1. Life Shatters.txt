Dying days of despair
Are the mirrors of pain
The glass in which I stare
Are slowly building a palace in my mind
Where the memories breeds my fear
With halls of mourning and with walls of bitter loss

The world around me dies
As the seasons change
The water turns to ice
And another year will push the past
Further back into forgetfulness
Among the moments never to return again

Lives are spread by the wind
Growing further apart
Can't return what has been
I will never again touch those winters
Or the shadows of the fall
Never the innocence, the light of each day

Tell me now, where's the end to our strive
Shattered life, the point where freedom dies
Behold my eyes, can't you see I'm terrified
Desperate holding on to a distant time

Life Shatters

Lives are spread by the wind
Growing further apart
Can't return what has been
I will never again touch those winters
Or the shadows of the fall
Never the innocence, the light of each day

So paint the edge with tears
Of a perished emotion
A wound so severe
And much too deep to be erased
By the healing hands of time
That life has withered, and is gone forevermore
