Fumbling in frustration, inside soul torn apart
Feel the loss of paradise, leave an empty heart
Closing eyes will shut out, the warm light of a life
Grip is fading slowly, for each day passing by

The soul is bleeding from thorns inside
Red blood is flowing in waves of tide

Shades of lies are playing, on pale and stone cold face
Eyes reflects compassion, take the empty space
Down on knees I'm weak, don't turn your back on me
Lips are full of lines, which only I can see

It hurts so bad, I cannot breathe
So lonely so lost, in misery

Breathing a lie, I am denied

Blindfold my eyes, I am to die

Push away in anger, a disappointed mind
The streak of truth I seek, It touch so deep inside
Illusions has been washed, away like grains of sand
In endless waves of sea, the shore of unknown land
