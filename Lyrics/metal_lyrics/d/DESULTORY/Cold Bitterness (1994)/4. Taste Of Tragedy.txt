Into the void of
Accusation
Into the point of
No return

Give me a shelter
From your rain
The fall of anger
Storm of pain
Our surface breaks in
Agony
Your bitter voice tastes
Tragedy

So here's the frozen silence
The shadow of our lives
The space between two spirits
A child of our lies

Turn away
Two shattered eyes in pain
Life betrays
Frustration of a dying flame
Mind decays
Words swallowed by the blame
Fall astray
Our feelings slowly fades

The taste of tragedy engulf
The feelings that no longer lives

The thorn of disbelief
Raping souls
Our web of trust now
Filled with holes
Cold chains of everyday
Bleeding scars
Different living minds
Drifting apart

So here's the frozen silence
The shadow of our lives
The space between two spirits
A child of our lies
