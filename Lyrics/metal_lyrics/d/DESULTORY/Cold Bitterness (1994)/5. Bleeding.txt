Stare into the unknown
See the truth reveal
Turn away in helplessness

Gaze upon the future
Gaze into the black
My bitter eyes reflects the pain

Tear down the images
Of what lies ahead
When sadness rules my every move
Tear down your hopeful thoughts
Try to realize
That no one ever guides your way

And I bleed
Bleeding
Blood from my soul
It drains away
And I bleed
I bleed for you
And I bleed for me

Just give me a reason not
To paint the future black
When all my hope just fades away, just fades away

I can see no future
Here in front of me
What's the point of living
When I could be free

Bleeding
Blood from my soul
It drains away
And I bleed
I bleed for you
And I bleed for me
