Marching through reality
With a lie before your eyes
Adapt and die
In the endless maze of life

Embedded in apathy
See the future in the past
Too weak to try
To break the chain at last

I stare into your eyes
And I watch something die
I turn away and run
Into oblivion

Softly I buried now
Buried into the grey
Be silent, be dead
Just do what others say

I look at you
You strive to find the way
You're silent, you're dead
You do what others say

I can see right through you
You're not in harmony
Not in harmony with life
Just like me

Alive but dead
Alive but dead

Search for nothing
In this life that I abuse
A race against time
That I'm about to lose

I can read your mind
You think we've just begun
My friend you're lost
Towards the end we run
