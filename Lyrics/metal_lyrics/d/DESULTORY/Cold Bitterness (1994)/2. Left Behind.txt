Dead light is shining through
Spreading the years of grey
Leaving our past behind
Faces are turned away
I watch you spread your wings
With eyes of apathy
You're carried by the winds
Unchained and living free

Castle of dying life
Home of security
Within the heart of silence
I'm living in a dream
Inside my world of envy
Days filled with emptiness
Trembling in fear of facing
My growing loneliness

Lies now comes alive
Dead dreams flows away
Just fear for me to find
Pain lives, I'm left behind

The shades upon my face
Can't keep the pain inside
Hear cries beneath my laughter
See tears in every smile
I've always felt so clear
It had to end one day
But dreams could never tell
That it would hurt this way
