Visions sweeps across my mind
The final call I hear
Darkness falls eternally
Inside embraced with fear
Breeding fear comes over me
Scared of what I'll find
Darkest recollections
Death intrudes my mind

With open eyes I shall behold
I'm not afraid to see

What will I find, who will I meet
What visions will I see
Chaos sinks into my mind
What will become of me
Descend into another world
The place of final peace
A new dimension far away
Where everything will cease

Now, silently I'll march towards the end
Life is hidden well beyond the veils of pain

Go beyond, experience
What no one did before
To the place where time is dead
And stay forever more
Darkest place, emptiness
No visions left to see
This is the place where I will spend
Eternal destiny
