What is lost what is found
We starve ourselves to death
This is the pit - here's where I dig
One on one, two on one - tear you down
Break the will inside you - make you fit

Beg for deliverance - cut your way out

Hide my head in the sand
Look away again
Step by step were going down
Is this the war of the pacifist
Is this the god of the nihilist

Beg for deliverance - cut your way out

Into the void again - this time it's for real
Hide from this constant fear - this wound will not heal
Now I can't save your soul - can't help you to breath
Pray for forgiveness now - get ready to bleed

Now another day has passed
And I can't see where to go
It's tragedy in its prime
Waste the hours - do my time

Now I can't save your soul - can't help you to breath
Pray for forgiveness now - get ready to bleed
