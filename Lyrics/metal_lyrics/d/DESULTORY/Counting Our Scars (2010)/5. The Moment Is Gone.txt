All colours are gone
I stay black to escape
The grain in my eyes reeks of bitter regret
Chasing those hours, wasting that time
Try to hold on to the past, but the moment is gone

And I can't wait for this life
It's already over me
And I try to slow it all down
But the moment has passed - the moment is gone

Down in this hole, it cripples my soul
Nothing can help me to crawl back again
What can I do, what have I done
A minute to late - a lifetime to long

Now the pain comes again
Now the moment is gone

A shivering ghost, a blistering cold
Now this soul will be twisted and torn
Consumed by this shadow, engulfed in this shade
When will it end, when will it fade
Try to hold on to the past, but the moment is gone

Now the pain comes again
Now the moment is gone
