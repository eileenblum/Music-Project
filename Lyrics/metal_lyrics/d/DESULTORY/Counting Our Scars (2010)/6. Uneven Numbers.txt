Can't decrypt this code - can't hear you, you scare me
Repeating history, this silence is deafening
Advancing backwards, still counting, still hoping
Throw it all away - translucent and hollow

Can't give forgiveness now, it's tragic, pathetic
Scriblling figures, no control, I'm in freefall
No emotions left, just waiting for nothing
Breaking me apart, replaced and forgotten

Once again - I'm standing here with nothing
Once again - I'm left alone
Once again - can't you feed this sorrow
Your soul will be standing right next to mine
