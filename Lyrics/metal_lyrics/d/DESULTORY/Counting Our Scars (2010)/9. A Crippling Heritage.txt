What is wrong with you, it's broken
We are done, can't you see
You're dying, how can you laugh at me
This pain is nothing
Defeated - broken - bleeding
All I've got - is what I - was given

And it's always one more lie
Can't go on, can't go back
And it's always one more lie
Stuck in this trap

Do I serve - your purpose
What is this - what are we doing here
Hold your breath now - for how long - for too long - it's done
Defeated - broken - bleeding
All I've got - is what I - was given

Burn these images into your eyes
Look behind all this and realise
I don't know what is breaking inside
I don't know what I'm going to find

Stuck in this trap
