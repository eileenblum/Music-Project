Shut down, turn off - erase and forget
My heart is getting numb
My square, my circle - just walk this dotted line
I cannot hear your scream - I can not, I can not

We fail, succeed - it is not up to me
I'm getting lost again - can't find you can't find me
Can't follow this footprint, it's getting hard to see
This knot around my neck gets tighter and tighter

Our lives subsides - in disgrace
In a cage
Until our hearts stop - endless maze
In a cage

I know what it's like but can you hear me
Drowning in this hole but can you save me
Inside - in this cage - it's getting darker
Inside - in this cage - it's getting cold

Our lives subsides - in disgrace
In a cage
Until our hearts stop - endless maze
In a cage
Face to face - I can't embrace - our lives at stake in a cage
Face to face - I can't embrace - our lives at stake in a cage

For how long can you look away
When nothing ever comes your way
