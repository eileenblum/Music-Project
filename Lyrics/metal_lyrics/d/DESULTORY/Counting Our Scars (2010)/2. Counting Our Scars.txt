Can you live this lie
Can you breathe when nothing gains
And day by day - we'll all just fade away
My eyes were blind
Moving on but going nowhere
That feeble mind - would always grag you down

Can you still believe
Can you still ignore this panic
Your world caved in and left you shivering
Can you rise again
Can you rise when all is lost
When all you see - will only break you down

So here we are
Burning the soil again
We're ripped apart
We're counting our scars

I can't see them
I just feel them
Move your fingers
Tear them open

It is all inside
Can you keep it in forever
You're torn apart - this hole inside your heart
Can you rise again
Can you rise when all is lost
When all you see - will only break you down
