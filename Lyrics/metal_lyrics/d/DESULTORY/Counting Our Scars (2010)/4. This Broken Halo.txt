There is no truth - break the illusion
Will you submit to this confusion
We have no choice - breath out our sickness
It's a mistake - it's a delusion

We're all outnumbered - were all alone
Let those sinners cast their stone
Clear this path - road to damnation
Now it's too late to find salvation

So leave this broken halo, leave it all behind
You can't erase this madness can't rewind
Never again you told me, never again you said
We will all burn together when all is dead

Chaos - damn this charade, sinking in malice
Faking our masquerade, twisting in madness

It's getting close now - inhale the tension
There is no time for your redemption
Before the storm - it all subsides
Now it's over - close your eyes
