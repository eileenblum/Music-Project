A flesh wound - bleeding open
It drains out all your hope
Don't come closer, in here there is no air
I'm that eye - staring at you now
Fail to cry - this is the place where all the dead ends meet

What gets - inside
Always stays inside
And all those screams will never  leave me alone
Force that nail - into this hopeless heart
I will fail - if this is what it takes

What's it gonna be
How it is gonna feel - when they turn it around
What are you gonna hear
What are you gonna see - when you fall to the ground
When I try to speak
All these dead ends meet

I slip down - on loose ground
Falling further down the line
And all this rage is burning - out of control
I'm that eye - staring at you now
Fail to cry - this is the place where all the dead ends meet

I slip down - on loose ground
Falling further down the line
And all this rage is burning - out of control

It's all done - it's all set
It's all you'll ever need
Don't move, don't move, don't even try to breathe

It's all done - it's all set
It's all you'll ever need
Don't move, don't move, don't even try to breathe
Force that nail - into this hopeless heart
I will fail - if this is what it takes to stay alive
