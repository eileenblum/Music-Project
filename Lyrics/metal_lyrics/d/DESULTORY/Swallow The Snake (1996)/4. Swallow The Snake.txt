Scream to me, make me see why you are crumbling.
Build a grave one brick each day, the beast is rumbling.
Is it way too tempting to rape that crying child?
Is it so addictive to tell another lie?

Suck the space in million ways, the fools collision.
The super rush, eternal buzz, the freaks affection
now I'm counting snowflakes and the cattle herd
makes my head start spinning and my senses burn

Can you ever be forgiven for giving apathy a prize.
Can I ever turn my other cheek when you kill before my eyes

I'm just a floating zombie.
Don't wanna live your life.
I need to touch some substance
not just sugar for my mind.
Now I'm counting snowflakes
and the cattle herd makes
my head start spinning
and my senses burn
