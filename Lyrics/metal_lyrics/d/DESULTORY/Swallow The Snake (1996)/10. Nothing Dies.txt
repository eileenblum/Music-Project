Peel away the skin that hurts.
Peel away the skin that burns.

Turn away from all you know
Turn away to save your soul

Peel away the skin that's cold.
Peel away the skin that's old

Will I ever touch the sun again.
Will it blind my eyes and ease the pain.
Will I ever burn my hands again nothing ever stays the same

See through the lies.
See that nothing ever dies,
nothing dies, nothing ever dies
