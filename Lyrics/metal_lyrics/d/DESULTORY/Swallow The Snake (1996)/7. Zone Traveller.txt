I turn my face to a different place
to taste the air they're breathing there.
I race with winds through time and space
to catch the marks they are leaving.
Raging screams from killing streets.
Their toxic wounds are bleeding

I drink your rain and sail your wave.
The black gold's in my face.
A fire's burning in my eyes.
I've had enough of your ways

Take me home, take me home.
I'll leave your sins and dirty whores.
Take me home, take me home.
I've seen the pain, her aching sores

I fled the southern hemisphere.
I ran upon the sea.
I felt the tradewind through my hair
not for a second loosing speed

Take me home, take me home.
I'll leave your sins and dirty whores.
Take me home, take me home.
I've seen the pain, her aching sores

I have travelled the world.
I have travelled the world.
It's like the fate of humanity's decided by my words

I climb the wall so afraid to fall,
smell the breath from the ground.
Each grip I take every move I make,
you always bring me down

And I can't replace if you keep
the pace killing is for sale
The right hand steal and the other feed
we're running for our tail.
