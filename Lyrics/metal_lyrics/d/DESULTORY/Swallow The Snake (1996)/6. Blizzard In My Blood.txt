I feel the touch of your hand sweeping across our land.
I see the work of your hand spreading across our land

I know the changes, they are temporary
waves and they're never here to stay
but hurry now cos patience just don't live
forever and I feel like 100 years today

And when I die if I do.
I've seen a hundred of you and when I die if I do.
I know just what you do

There are days when I can reach up
to the sun days that couldn't go too slow but today
I'm at the bottom of the world, yeah, today I feel so low

Yeah - It feels so hopeless in my grave
Yeah - It's like I'm mouldering every day
Yeah - I need a blizzard through my blood
Yeah - to drown my veins into the flood
