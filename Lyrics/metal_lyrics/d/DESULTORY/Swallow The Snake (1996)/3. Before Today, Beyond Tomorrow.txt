Your time means nothing, a journey for the sun.
A change of wind and weather into a different kind.
It's like you never passed upon this golden plains.
Your life was just a flash, I wish I'd remember

The morning breeze threw sand in my face
But I will meet the day with dignity.
I know the secrets buried in this place.
But I can't remember

I watched your father, I have seen them all.
Owe the treasures of our land, I have seen them fall
and now the screams have died into a distant world
a place of joy and pride I still can't remember

My limbs are carved in stone on the ground
I'm gonna stay awake forever.
I know each move every single sound
but I can't remember

I've seen the centuries slowly pass me by
They may have marked my being but by god I'm still alive.
Days passed in dust of sand against the crimson horizon.
I feel the touch of our fathers hand, I wish I'd remember
