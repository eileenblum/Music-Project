I can't ignore the highway, I've got it in my dreams.
It's right beside my palace and just above the sea.
I have the stars around me, sometimes I feel the world.
And from the top of his lighthouse we touch the universe

The western sky is bleeding, our view is open wide.
The sun is burning the city, this valley is divine.
I am the king of the hill now, my senses are aroused.
If I maintain the balance my head will reach the clouds

I look upon my kingdom.I can't hold back my pride.
A perfect situation.
