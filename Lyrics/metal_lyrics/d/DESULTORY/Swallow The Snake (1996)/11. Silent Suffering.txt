Crush the dreams within and do away with all the joy and pride.
Leave the past behind just leave it all and heal the wounds inside.
But I will never hear, I'll never see. I'll never ever trust again.
But do you know and do you care, to me it's all the same

Crush the one that speaks.
Just go ahead and tear the world apart.
And let them pay just let them pay for tearing out your heart.
I will be the one that steals the smile
that steals the smile right off your face.
And trust me now that I'll be here,
be there to count your days

Can you feel the pain.
Can you feel the silent suffering.
Can you ease the pain.
Can you make me wanna come alive.
Can you make me die

Don't let me ever hear your voice again
Don't let me ever see your face again

1996 Metal Blade Records
