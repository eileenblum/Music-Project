Soon after you finally passed away
Your body will rot, start to decay
No way to stop this repulsive destiny
Maggots will devour whatâs left of you and me
Intrude the inner organs the flesh will not be saved
The putrid stench surrounds the place where you are laid
The veins that once were filled with blood so strong and red
Have now been dried up, such a shame itâs to be dead

Now you have become a gruesome picture of yourself
Bacteria will revel, infesting every cell
Your eyes have been consumed, not much remaining of your face
Youâll slowly disappear, death has no feeling for disgrace
Even though your life has ceased the abscess will arise
Cover all your body, grow to extensive size
The sight of you is now enough to drive a mind insane
Blank bones and rotten flesh is all that will remain

Flesh begins to rot
Limbs are falling off
Bones begin to show
Skin has been dissolved
Should have done as they said
Chosen the flames instead

Disappearing like millions before
Unavoidable fate
Donât wanna end in disgrace
But now itâs too late

Passed away
Passed away

All that will remain
