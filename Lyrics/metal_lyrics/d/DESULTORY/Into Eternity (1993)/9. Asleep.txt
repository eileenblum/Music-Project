Asleep again
Darkness is ruling
Within my mind
I feel I'm flying slowly
A dream so real
Alive and frightening
A grotesque sight
My senses shiver deep inside

These nightly scenes
Now twisting my eyes
I see it clear
Painted up before me
Forgotten place
Buried beneath sea
Mountain high
The lord of evil I behold

In silence I dream
Of things yet unseen
Through aeons I see
With closed eyes, in dreams

Deep in me, cries
Terrified
Lame inside, dead
Cannot fight

Awake at last
I'm cold and shaking
So terrified
I stare at my own hands
I have created
Deep in my sleep
A sick reflection
Of the horrid things I've seen

1993 Metal Blade Records
