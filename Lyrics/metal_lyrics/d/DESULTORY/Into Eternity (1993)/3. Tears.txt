Tears from my eyes
Burning my skin, down on their way
Bitter tears
Filled with dreams, they flow away

I had it all
Like water it slipped between my hands
It disappeared
Lonely and cold, abandoned I stand

All I was living for
Now suddenly is gone
All my hopes and thoughts
That I had were wrong

Dreams made my world
I raised a wall, with visions filled
Before my eyes
It turned to dust, this lie I've built

I lay myself down
I close my eyes, and resign
Feelings die
I leave my past far behind

So now it seems
Like my tears will never stop to fall
With tearfilled eyes
I watch my dreams just slip away

Let me pass
Away into eternal sleep
Greeted by silence
Embraced by darkness, by arms so deep

I let it go
I'm falling weightless, emotion flies
I fade away
The wind softly moves me as I die...
