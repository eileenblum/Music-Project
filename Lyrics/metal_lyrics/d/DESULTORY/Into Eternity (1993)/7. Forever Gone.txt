Why, tell me why, we all have to die

Pain and sorrow, inside of me
Resurrection, will never be
No holy father, no holy son
Can bring you back now, forever gone

Deathly loss rips apart everything
that once was living
Nevermore happiness, hopeless thoughts
overwhelms me
Sorrowfilled agony, die inside,
deadly silence
Desperate cries inside, no one can
ease my sorrow

Open up your eyes and you will see
Nothing will remain eternally
Apathy arise inside of me
Forced into this new reality

Silence surrounds me, mind filled with fear
Darkness approaches, death calls I hear

Deathly loss rips apart everything
that once was living
Nevermore happiness, hopeless thoughts
overwhelms me
Sorrowfilled agony, die inside,
deadly silence
Desperate cries inside, no one can
ease my sorrow
