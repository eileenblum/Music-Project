As the moon lays its veil
Over the blanket of snow
The dark and ice-cold water
Swirling by deep below
I stare with absent eyes
Into foam so white
Water now in furious rage
I'm paralyzed by this sight

Waves storms as if in dance
Making a living bed
They climb and rise so high
Only to fall down dead
Chaos strikes my mind
A dreamlike battle inside
And though my conscience shivers
My body wants to fly

So fragile is it, the flame of life
That burns within us, so deep inside
It is so easy for me to fall
It is so easy to lose it all

So close now, so easy
I want to see, yet stay alive
Emotions frustrate me
Too scared to see what dwells behind

My twisted mind-cries
This weird emotion-I defy

Just a single step
And into the end I'll fall
Life is just a shadow
It's so easy to lose it all
I silently sigh and turn,
around and walk away
I've finally decided to live another day

So close now, so easy
I want to see, yet stay alive
Emotions frustrate me
Too scared to see what dwells behind
