You're so problematic
And I know it's symptomatic
Of you own masochistic ills
A psychoanalyzer would say
"Better tranquilize her.
Numb her with some of these pills."
A triple case of nerves
Is more than you deserve
But you've only got yourself to blame
You're sick and sadistic
That's why I go ballistic
Your excuses always sound so lame
Your love is for sale, yeah
I won't be the buyer
Bogged down in your emotional mire
You're not my messiah
Just another liar
Go find another bank roll to hire
Your mind is barren, stark
It must be stuck in park
You'd better get your shit together
You know what they say
"Tomorrow's another day.
Things can always get better."
Been on my best behavior
You are not my savior
You are just another vice
Was I this week's flavor?
Just do me a favor
And stay the fuck out of my life
Won't be your provider
You're a coat-tail rider
That's why I'm so glad we're through
Your brain's a short circuit
That's why I'd rather jerk it
Than spend another night with you
Your mind is barren, stark
It must be stuck in park
You'd better get your shit together
You know what they say
"tomorrow's another day.
Things can always get better."
Things can always get better
Things can always get better
