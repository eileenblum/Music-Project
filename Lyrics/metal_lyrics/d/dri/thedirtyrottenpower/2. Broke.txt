Give all my money to chicks
And the dude at the corner store
After I pay the landlord
I ain't got no more
Money comes and money goes
It's already spent
But it's no mystery
Where it all went
That's why I'm always broke
Hey man, it ain't no joke
I can't seem to save
Pay my bills or behave
If it wasn't for that monthly bill
I'd be a millionaire
"hey guys, up here in front
Just pull up a chair
Girl, come on over here
You can drink your fill
Bartender, keep 'em coming
Put 'em on my bill"
That's why I'm always broke
Hey man, it ain't no joke
I can't seem to save
Pay my bills or behave
