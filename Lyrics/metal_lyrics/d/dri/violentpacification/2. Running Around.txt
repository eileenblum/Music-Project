On the run and on the right track
On the run and I'm never coming back

On the run and on the right track
On the run and I'm never coming back

I'm running from what I might be
From Society
From myself and everyone wants to help
You can't
I'm running around with my head cut off
Trying to make believe I'm not

On the run and on the right track
On the run and I'm never coming back

On the run and on the right track
On the run and I'm never coming back

Trying so hard to keep to my yard
Running circles around the block
Running and wondering whether or not
I can stop
I can't stop
