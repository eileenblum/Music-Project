Home from school and here to stay
I'll take it easy again today
Ain't gonna work, don't need no pay

Couch Slouch
Fuck Off

My mom don't like the way I live
She says I take but I don't give
My dad can't stand the way I am
He says, "Damn it, just get up man"

Couch Slouch
You Suck

Awaken now and then to eat and shit
Don't go outside 'cause I don't fit
Society's not ready for me
Crazy assholes never will be
