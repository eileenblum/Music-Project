We talk of the dead - their moaning in the nights
We speak of their souls - decaying into beyond
We fucked the bastards - when feelings burdened their lives 
Now they rise again to rape us reversed
Bone crusher!
You that sleep in mud
Bone crusher!
Smell their unholy blood! 
Careless carcass
Soulless being
Nameless pervert
Cynic rapist
From the abyss of eternal affliction a compelling creature awakens - fresh from the dead
Spawned to kill, sent to murder on the marshes of humanity 
Hate them!
Prepare your grinder - for the final attack
Wait In anger - until mankind is exposed
Sharpen your blades - they shall slice them from all flesh
Damn, damn, damn them?.
Bone crusher!
You that sleep in the mud
Bone crusher!
Smell their unholy blood 
Laughing at your victims - as your crush them alive
Impaling their bodies - on sticks of flames and wire
Skinning their flesh - as pigs you slaughter them all
The rest you eat - and spitting out the teeth 
Bone crusher!
You that sleep in the mud
Bone crusher!
Smell their unholy blood 
Careless carcass
Soulless being
Nameless pervert
Cynic rapist
