Poison in the veins of all that lives
Time has come for all that is
Obliteration in 7 stages 
Final touch - Life Eraser
Bleeding in the gutters of the underworld
No skin on flesh - your cries not heard
No blood in veins just white washed brains
Stoned beyond imagination - No soul in eye
Carving into life of the mankind souls
Abominations cynic as ice is cold
Incineration in 7 stages
Final touch - Life eraser
The world is doomed in the seconds to come
The clash of wars draws closer
War machines killing tens of millions
Blood tsunamis drowning the rest
Poison in the veins of all that lives
Time has come for all that is
Obliteration in 7 stages 
Final touch - Life Eraser
Bleeding in the gutters of the underworld
No skin on flesh - your cries not heard
Carving into life of the mankind souls
Abominations cynic as ice is cold
Incineration in 7 stages
Final touch - Life eraser
