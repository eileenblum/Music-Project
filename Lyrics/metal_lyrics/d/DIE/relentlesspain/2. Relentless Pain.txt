It is the year of ultimate darkness
Where all shall expire in fear
Pain is on the way - suffering from today
Torment we all are feeling
Persistent Pain puts you on the edge of sanity 
As the world begins to rot
A destructive scheme of brutality 
From your societies control sick top 
Marching from the north, step by step they change the world
The sky is thick with smoke from their cyclone technology
The snow is black falling from above in wet chunky balls
"We shall die, we shall die, we shall die!" 
Now you wander out in the night as the rest
Spitting out your guts to put you to the test
Nothing will remain in your thoughtless shell
Forever a creature in your own incarnated hell
A legion of brainwashed minions will strain you to your bed
Barbwire cuts your skin as the plunger hits your brain
You hold your breath in pain when reality begins to fade
A zombie of society as they put your soul in chains 
It is the year of ultimate darkness
Where all shall expire in fear
Pain is on the way - suffering from today
Torment we all are feeling
