Awful in pain, he is looking down to see
The syringes, his blood slowly tap
Dripping into a bucket on the floor
Needles thick as a wrist, his skin have pierced

He found himself isolated in an eerie chamber
Barbwire pressing his flesh to the bed
Tightening for each breath he takes
Fearing the end has come

Awful in pain, he is looking down to see
The syringes, his blood slowly tap
Dripping into a bucket on the floor
Needles thick as a wrist, his skin have pierced

Dazed by his blood loss
He feels his life slip away
A light begins to shine

So in pain as his vessels dry out
Left alone in an half dead corpse
Still alive but dead outside
Still alive but dead outside

EXE-CUTION-ROOM!
EXE-CUTION-ROOM!

He found himself isolated in an eerie chamber
Barbwire pressing his flesh to the bed
Tightening for each breath he takes
Fearing the end has come

Awful in pain, he is looking down to see
The syringes, his blood slowly tap
Dripping into a bucket on the floor
Needles thick as a wrist, his skin have pierced

He found himself isolated in an eerie chamber
Barbwire pressing his flesh to the bed
Tightening for each breath he takes
Fearing the end has come

Awful in pain, he is looking down to see
The syringes, his blood slowly tap
Dripping into a bucket on the floor
Needles thick as a wrist, his skin have pierced
