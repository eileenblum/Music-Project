Rising from the abyss
Drawn to the above

Feeding on infected minds
Prowling through the night
Leaving disembodied shells
Spreading the disease

Gathering strength through misery
Exterminating puny insects

Iâll rip out your mind
Iâll tear out your heart
Youâre helpless against me
Grovel before me

Iâll rip out your mind
Iâll tear out your fucking heart
Youâre helpless against me
Grovel before me

Soul Scavenger

Iâll rip out your mind
Iâll tear out your heart
Youâre helpless against me
Grovel before me

Iâll rip out your mind
Iâll tear out your fucking heart
Youâre helpless against me
Grovel before me

Youâre helpless against me
Youâre helpless against me

Soul Scavenger

Iâll rip out your mind
Iâll tear out your heart
Youâre helpless against me
Grovel before me

Soul Scavenger

Iâll rip out your mind
Iâll tear out your fucking heart
Youâre helpless against me
Grovel before me

Iâll rip out your mind
