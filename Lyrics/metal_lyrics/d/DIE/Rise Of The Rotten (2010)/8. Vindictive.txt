VINDICTIVE!

Drowning in your loss
My mistake has cornered me
Vampire leave me alone
I want to be

Consequences need to be served
Like the last breath
In the bag around your neck

VINDICTIVE!

Consequences need to be served
Like the last breath
In the bag around your neck
Carrying your body down my cellar
Fulfilling every dream I have had!

BLACKENED!

Blackened by your presence
Nothing will remain intact
Hallucinating all my thoughts
Oceans filled with your guts is what I want

Dripping blood
Wanting more
Can't dream
No more

Dripping blood
Wanting more
Can't dream
No more

I!

I got you in my sight
Nothing can conflict my work
Adrenaline in your body
A rope around your neck
AND - USE - MY - SELF AS THE TREE!
