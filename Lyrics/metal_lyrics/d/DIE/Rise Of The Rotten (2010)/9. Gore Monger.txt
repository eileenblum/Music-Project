HUNGRY!!

In the house where the mad man resides
Darkness - Shadows
Seven stiffs beneath the floor lie
Torsos - Bodies
Dire smell form the dead below
Sour blood - Putrid feet
But what to sell when the budget is low
MAN FLESH - MAN FLESH!

Dead and gone - Flesh for the public
Eye by eye - Sold in chocolate
Lung by lung - in fine pulp lies
Stand in line - For the gore inside

Skin made gloves
Blood sausage
Nails as chips

Bowels soup
Fresh baked tooth
Tongue in bun

Dead and gone - Flesh for the public
Eye by eye - Sold in chocolate
Hair by hair - In toothbrush lies
Stand in line - For the gore inside

Dead and gone - Flesh for the public
Eye by eye - Sold in chocolate
Breast by breast - Blended with rice
Stand in line - For the gore inside

10 new recruits in my fast food chain
Hunger - Famine
But what to do when no dead-stock remain
Refill - Fill up
First to come are the waitress long legs
Slice them - Sell them
Second comes her boyfriends big eggs
Cook them - Fry them!
