Howling from the tombs of the battered and deceased
The spouses of the arcane celebrant
Their graves undisturbed in the desert they are made
From bones of 30 starving slaves

Shades in the cursed sepulchre
The weeping and - cleansing of the damned
The efficient craftwork - siphoning blood
Barrels filled - left to rot

Behind the stagnant skin only bones fill the corpse
The hair on their heads are tracky threads
Failing to emerge - they feed upon themselves
Just to tame the hunger deep inside

Shades in the cursed sepulchre
The weeping and - cleansing of the damned

Peeling off the wood from the inside
Of a decomposed coffin
A glance at the world
Through a gap in the grave
