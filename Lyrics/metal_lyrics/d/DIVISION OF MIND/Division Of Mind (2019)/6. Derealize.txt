Lost my future to a stranger.
He tied me off and shot me up with self disgust.
A shadow crawling at the bottom of the world - practiced illusion was never enough.
None of the words I spit extinguish hell behind my eyes.
Lost my way in a maze of enemies, suffocating in a web of lies.
Lost my future in a strange land.
It tied me off and shot me up with self disgust.
Fed me poison with a smile - and now I bleed out in a hole it dug.
But when I dream you all have one neck.
And when I dream I have my hands on it.
