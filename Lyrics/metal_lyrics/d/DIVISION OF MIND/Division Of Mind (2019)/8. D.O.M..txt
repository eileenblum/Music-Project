Deliberate artifice - administrated values feeding the emptiness.
War of self.
Annihilate - cannibal consumption until nothing remains.
Shifting flesh, ceasing breath.
Picking through the ash though you know that there's nothing left.
What does it matter where you stand?
What does it matter when machines rig the scales in an unending sentence to death?
Terminal state - division of mind.
The pain will only return in time.
