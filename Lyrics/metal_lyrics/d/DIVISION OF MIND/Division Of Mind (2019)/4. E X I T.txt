A cry - collision of secrets in collapsing time.
A sound - the cognitive splinter of withdrawing light.
New eyes shut to the curse of sight.
Two holes in the mask of life.
A shroud - collection of shadow, the horrible calm.
An end - the fatal dose, I swallow it down.
Crushed between the snarling jaws of life.
Alone against all - alone I fight.
Machinery folding, a broken stumble, amounting to nothing.
Suffering, doubting, seizing, and cursed.
Through delirium I search for an outside.
Fate of all fates, zero spreads and eradicates.
Alone against all.
Alone I cry.
Alone I fight.
Through delirium, I search for outside.
