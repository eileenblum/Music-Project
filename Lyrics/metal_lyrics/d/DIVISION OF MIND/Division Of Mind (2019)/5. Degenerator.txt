Blackness - in which no words are conceived, haunting what is and what always will be.
Terrorizing - reverberant - unseen.
The dread of foreign form.
Xenopresence in droning swarms.
Thoughts pool in a damaged brain.
A body contorted and flooded by pain.
Waking and strangled by light - hands claw my face to shield from the sight.
Voice of a nauseous crowd - sink into a haze to escape the sound.
Sun on the burning sand, blank gaze at the body with the stone in my hands.
Swallowed by unending dark - a hole in my chest where I had a heart.
Silence broken by an infinite scream, circling the drain of an endless dream.
