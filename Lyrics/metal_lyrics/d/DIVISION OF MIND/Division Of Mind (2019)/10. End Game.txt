I don't recognize life when the fever breaks and leaves the grey of a headstone drawn across my face - a cry of pain.
You stalk an endless hallway looking for me in the basement of heaven, choking when you see - a cry of pain.
Hell has no limit to collected nothing locked away.
Just close the door when there's nothing left to be.
