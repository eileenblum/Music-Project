[Lucifer:]
How I wept in violent distress...
how I cried in horried anguish!
I know thou art hurting inside...
I know of thine suppressed grief...
I know... I know His light!..

[Deliah:]
So unfold thine hands;
Hosts of Seraphim and Archangels...
host of Thrones and Cherubim...
Lift thy knees from desolation
and join nocturnal salvation!
