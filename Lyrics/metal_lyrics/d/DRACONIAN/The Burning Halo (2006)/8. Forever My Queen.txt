[Pentagram cover]

I run away with myself
I think I ran a little too far
Your love is more than a tease
And I'm gonna give it all of my heart
The situation is all wrapped up
And no more needs to be said, oh no
You live in my world gotta heed me
And I know that you can 'cause you need me
There ain't nothin' gonna stop us now
We're willing and we both know how
And baby, you're gonna be my queen
'cause the king always knows what he means
Well, alright
The future looks only a sea
Of the troubled times ahead for you and me
