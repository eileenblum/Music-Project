[Originally performed by Ekseption]

On a Sunday they will kill the world
And on Monday they will cry and shout
Then on Tuesday they will just try out
What will happen to the burning crowd

And you hearing this song
You will smile, and think that IÂ´m wrong
IÂ´m a friend you killed in your mind
IÂ´m four kids and you didnÂ´t find

On a Sunday they will kill the world

On a Sunday they will kill the world

And you will think of me
But IÂ´m gone and then IÂ´ll see
In the sky for me sits one, too
What they did, some people like you

On a Sunday they will kill the world
