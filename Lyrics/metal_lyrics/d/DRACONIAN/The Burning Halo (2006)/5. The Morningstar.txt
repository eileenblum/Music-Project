"I've cried a river for you to swim
to let you know the state we're in.
I've dreamt a vision for you to see
that the night is the only worthy key"

I have seen Heaven's sleep,
and I've watched the angels weep,
they are slaves of fear and pain
I know that the dark will save us all
as long we praise the dragons call.

Eternal seems the time,
but the only true love will remain,
and darkness shall rise up to Heaven
to embrace the last, final prayer...
Cause the grace of His word once spoken
is now shattered by a promise broken.

"So curse the tyrant, curse the light,
for we are free here in this night.
So embrace the sorrow, kiss the tears...
follow the wind to erase your fears,
for the fires burn bright, the fires of blue,
and in the end it will burn in all of you."

The war will come,
apocalyptic storms of a tortured silence
as God oppresses His last, final soul...
and eternal seems the time,
but the only true love will remain,
and darkness shall rise up to Heaven
to embrace the last, final prayer...
So deny God's light and His words spoken...
We regain Heaven and crush His skull wide open!

"I've cried a river for you to swim,
to let you know the state we're in.
I've sent a message throughout the stars,
for His kingdom is full of scars.
I am Lucifer, let us unite
come with me and live His light!

I am the Light...
That Leads to Darkness!
I am the Night...
Behold Pandemonium!
Behold the Morningstar!
Behold Lucifer"
