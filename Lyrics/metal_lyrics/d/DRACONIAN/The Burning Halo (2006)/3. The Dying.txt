We flew over these lands and broke our wings in the flight.
Precipitation so far from salvation to a blinding light of despairing life
I'm falling - my soul is starving.
So beautiful, this silent call -
With eyes of mist and snow -
This tear of our persistent cry.
Oh, how I cry...
How much sorrow can we stand?
How many tears do we have to shed?
We cried, we suffered, we died... over and over and over again.
Desolation sanctified - the walls are closing in.
Resurrection terrified - I see the humans grin.
We cried, we suffered, we died...
We starve ourselves from hope and dreams.
Desperation horrified - we wade in sickened blood.
Resurrection humanized - they smile with dripping poison.
Creator - believer - deceiver...
Desecrate - devastate - your souls are dead!
The sun will never rise again
Your sun will never rise again
The fading innocence, the dying beauty
A world of light darkens this peaceful night.
I'm falling - my soul is starving.
So beautiful, this silent call -
With eyes of mist and snow -
This tear of our persistent cry.
Your wretched empire falls apart...
The signs are shown all over the world.
