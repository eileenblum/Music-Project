Greed in a cage obsolete
painting colors of old
Victims of culture unfold,
the world sighs once more

Look at us, our eyes are dead;
A gaze of incentives mislead
A deadlight, a whisper
Unearth your face in the mirror

My hope soon to be over...
Take me and lock me in
Throw away the key
I'm beyond all help,
So kill me

Bleed in the cage of deceit,
then; die in the cold
This is the pain you withhold
when the world sighs once more

A treacherous spawn here fester,
holding the future hostage
and dancing restlessly and bare
with the phantom of time

Flies swarm as mouths open
and dead words are spoken.
This room has a foul smell...
There's blood on the walls
and I need to break out

Look at us, our eyes are dead;
A gaze of incentives mislead
A deadlight, a whisper
Unearth your face in the mirror

My hope soon to be over...
take me and lock me in
Throw away the key
I'm beyond all help
So kill me

A screaming silence
hushed beneath the sky;
silence... thrashing the firmament
