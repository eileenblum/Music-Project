On the shore, lost in our time,
currents are bursting through
From the sky; an aberration;
chimeras' burning you
In the dark; inside the earth
blood runs barren now
See this age, so discolored...
It's breaking down somehow

Our homes are since long deserted -
the planet cries from within
and slumbers still as her child dies
We're hiding from her love

The drowning age no longer waits,
born through hollow eyes
Feel the wind, behold the scourge
come closer and watch it rise

I sit on the vortex waiting for the world to fall;
Stretching through this illusory
empire, gasping for air as another life is written,
as another soul is taken

Nature cast out -
in your eyes a light was flickering

I didn't mean to scare you,
but I miss you...
Catharsis' burning!

Let's bring our gods to the gallows;
A new moon will shine on you
Let's bring our gods to the gallows;
A new light will shine on us all

In aching sorrow I break down
I see despair in what we've become
These chambers of demons full
finally darkens this fading glow

On the shore, lost in our time,
currents are bursting through
From the sky; an aberration;
chimeras' burning you
The drowning age has given birth,
we better unfold our hands
As we weep; then we shall wake
to return the inborn Earth

Our homes are since long deserted -
the planet cries from within
and slumbers still as her child dies
We're hiding from her love
