[Lyrics by Anders Jacobsson and Johan Ericson]

I am so far away...
You see, I'm nothing without thee
I fall down, down to the ground,
and all alone, I wish that I could go

Drown here with me,
hold me, save me

Are you there, beloved one?
I clench our whisper to the fading
Playing out this frozen dream
to watch me bleed in the sunrise
watch me bleed in the sunrise

Break, can you see how I break,
and still, my world remains the same
Don't die, please stay for a while
This night we'll learn how to fly

Snow is falling from ebon skies
and I see some peace in your eyes
Playing out this frozen dream
to watch us bleed in the sunrise
watch us bleed in the sunrise

I can't go on with the quiet,
to wait until we wake up,
to be gone with the fire
I must go now

Are you there, beloved one?
Will you help me carry on,
and lead me through the sunrise?
Lead me through the sunrise

I can't go on with the quiet,
to wait until we wake up,
to be gone with the fire
I must go now

[Sample is taken from a reading of "Ode to a Nightingale" by John Keats (1795-1821)]
