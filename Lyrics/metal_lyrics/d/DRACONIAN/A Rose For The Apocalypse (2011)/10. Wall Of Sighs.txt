[Bonus Track]

Today I lost my way
A circle of light I wept
and this torn curtain sank
a dire masquerade I slept

Empty value rending the afterglow
to witness the birth of the end
Hollow minds, a static lucidity...
I deserve to crawl, I've earned the weight

This cancer cadaverous
Atrocious humanity, breathe...
Breathe through the undertow
where no one is free
And with ashes we build,
'cause with ashes we see
I know dead hearts linger
in a world screaming at me

Last night I found some peace
for a while the angels sang
Last night there was no disease
for a while I smiled again

This cancer cadaverous
Atrocious humanity, breathe...
Breathe through the undertow
where no one is free
And with ashes we build,
'cause with ashes we see
I know dead hearts linger
in a world screaming at me
