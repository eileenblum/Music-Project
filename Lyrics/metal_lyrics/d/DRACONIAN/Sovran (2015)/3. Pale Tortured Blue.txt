On my naked back
A dance of the nocturnal sun
The tall grass crawls around me;
In adoration bowing can I find you in your dark?
Can you find me in your heart?

Thereâs a fallen statue in the wilderness
It has found its way to your dreams
Haunting the waking hours
In nightsâ color with eyes like rain

The shades beseech you
My love increases you
And summer freezes you into me...
The cold fire suits you!
A pale tortured blue blistering through

A lifeless lover was the high mountain
Where we tried to reach the stars,
The moon, the ways beyond
It was the purest love of all...

I will raise a statue in the wilderness
It will find its way to your dreams
This will haunt you forever
In nightsâ color with eyes like rain

Yet I collect the stars you wept,
Keeping them as my own
To be lost in your eyes
For all the sadness that we kept

And I fail to realize itâs you...
The cold suits you!
A pale tortured blue blistering through

When thereâs peace within myself
And everything else
A pale tortured blue blistering through
