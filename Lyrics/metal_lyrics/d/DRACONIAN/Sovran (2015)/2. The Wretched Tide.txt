Weâre leaving today
After dust-ridden shutters close
And heartbeats they rush
Then to cease in your embrace

These scars through-out the night
Left no more fighting in us
No tears to fill the void
In a place even devils fled

The wretched tongues
Wording their pain onto me
Until even tide enters
There's no place out of here

"For grace to lift me up every molecule
Whispered to make peace with this unreality
I felt I was slipping downwards
Into darkness
...and in darkness I stayed
Until sadness closed its eyes"

Ships passing in the silvery night,
Carrying this vicious, benevolent heart
And in sadness we part...
In the dark of you, in the dark of me

"Release these hearts from the turmoil!"

Tired and cold,	
A tale since eons of old...
So elusive this intemperance of escape

So much has fallen and is falling still.
Into the hands of the ever maddening crowd

So weâre leaving today
As dust-ridden shutters close
To site that glimmer of hope
And breathe, if only for awhile

These stars that turned the tide
Left no more fighting in us
No hope to find the dawn
In a place even specters dwell

Ships passing in the silvery night,
Carrying this vicious, benevolent heart
And in sadness we part...
In the dark of you, in the dark of me

"Release these hearts from the turmoil!
Only love before they drown..."

Tired and cold,	
A tale since eons of old...
So elusive this intemperance of escape

So much has fallen and is falling still.
Into the hands of the ever maddening crowd
