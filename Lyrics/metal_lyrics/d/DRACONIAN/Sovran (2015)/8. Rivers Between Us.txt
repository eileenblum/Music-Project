Where is the world I saw in your eyes?
It lived through the night, then whispered goodbye.
The cuts in your skin and the red in my eyes.
This winter inside is crushing me now.

"I am alone, I am scorn, I can't remember to forget you,
I just weather the storm".

The love that I had, it drowned with the tide,
stirring the waters where heartslay bare.
The cuts in your skin and the red in your eyes.
Enfolding this shame into despair.

Let me take the noose from our necks and carry us home.
Still so alive, even after you die, transcending with time.
We're just two cripples who fail to belong.
Yes, we are two cripples, but we need to hold on.

From this flesh my spirit longs to break away.
Did you ever feel this cosmic circumstance was never enough?
Wake me slowly if ever at all.
Wake me slowly or watch me fall.

The life that I had is gone with the tide (Watch me fall)
Another deception, I whisper goodbye.
The cuts in my flesh, the red in your eyes (Watch me fall).
These demons inside, they die with me now.
