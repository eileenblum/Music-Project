A place where daylight aches
Itâs all unreal to you
A sunset calls me here
I swear to love itâs true

So alien this vaulted screen
And patterns form into contours
The dark around me as dense as matter...
A stellar quake fills the astral space

How dare you not to see?
My tears are gifts to you
A heart you must set free,
How dare you not believe?

âBecame I freeze in the warmth, in the glow of Helios -
Sweat in the heart of summers drained
And radiant life to falter and beautiful tears to dry:
Iâm gracefully bowing... In horrorâ

Waterless like the ocean â 
Drizzling like the deserts;
Come emerge and wallow!
Pretend like nothing at all
Along the whirlwinds in your head
A place where daylight aches
Itâs all unreal to you
A world we must set free
I swear to love itâs true

Petrified spirit, dilated stare...
Iâm piercing through these icy shackles
Somehow cast around this nebula,
Unwilling to enter my birth

âWould you take my hand and follow through the ether?
Would you sweat and dance in winters1 bloom?
For radiant life to falter and beautiful tears to dry: â
I m gracefully bowing... In sorrowâ

Waterless like the ocean â
Drizzling like the deserts;
Come emerge and wallow!
Pretend like nothing at all
Along the whirlwinds in your head

â¦along the whirlwinds in your head

(Frailty and strength marry and dissolve
And the sky fills up with poetry and songâ¦
Into the soothing black we go)
