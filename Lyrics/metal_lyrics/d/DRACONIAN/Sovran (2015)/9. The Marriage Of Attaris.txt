âYou cannot hide from a grace already perceived
Thatâs a fierce grace indeed!
And you cannot hide a tree that is growing;
Valiantly stretching for the stars
Angles weep as they count your scarsâ

These rivers of blood-
Fields scorched to ash
Lament of life; a love song
We all share our sorrows
In light suspendedâ¦
Smiling at the ever dying sun.

Flakes of snow are melting
On the top of your eyes;
Shedding heavenâs tears
The tracks we left
Almost buried nowâ¦

This is a beautiful place!
Here Cassiel wedded winter
So man could grieve
So man could see
These trees are dark and old
In solitude unifiedâ¦
Licking the ground, tasting the rough
Cold wind, so man could breath

âThereâs no masquerade in your silence,
Just pages filled of winter
The seed of ascendance are hidingâ¦
Letâs drench the hours!â

These wastelands of dusk
Oceans bled and barren
Lament of life; a love-song
The only death awoken;
A fear of transcendence,
Keeps us from the rapture of one

And the blood of the sphere
It emptied their mouthsâ¦
Drowning the world

Hammer me down as pillars!
Veiled from creation unchanging,
Patching the holes and the cracks
Tightening the rope around your necks
And we see mankind aimlessly breeding,
Desperately bleeding
Erasing you, erasing me from here

-So tired, so tiredâ¦
I need to feel the freezing blue
Leave me here!
Let the coming of spring
Carry me back to earth.
Leave me here!
