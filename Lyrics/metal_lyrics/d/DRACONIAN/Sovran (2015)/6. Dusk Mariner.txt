No light finds me
Perish like the setting sun
No truth defies me
Unburdened use the fallen one

Iâd give you my love
But itâs freezing cold
My lips ever sealed
And the things I have done
Are slowly growing old,
Yet dying to be healed

No heart guides me
Frozen in the depths below
No fear leaves me
Iâm haunted by a distant soul

She gives me her voice
She gives me her soul
Yet demons in my view
As fear breaks down
I weep to understand
I was already you

Living in a circle of decay
Where morn remains the night
Under these starless skies
Loveâs out of sight

Breathe carelessly,
Be all you feared as a child
See, itâs only me
And not the heavens 
Coming down on you

No light finds me

She gave me her voice
It warms my soul
This angel in my view
As fear breaks down
I weep to understand
I was already you

We were walking in circles of decay
Where morn remains the night
Under these starlit skies
Love marks our flight

Farewell!
