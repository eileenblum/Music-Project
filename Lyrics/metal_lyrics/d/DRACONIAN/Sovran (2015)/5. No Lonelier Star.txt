Floating imperceptible cinders...
Back and forth a stare over the cosmic veil,
As a star is dying nuclear wintersâ coming;
Oh, entangled earth, distant eyes ablaze

Interweave forever into your hunger
As gravity collapses and light torn asunder

Sowing the seeds,
Then burning the fields
We are burning the fields,
Then sowing the seeds

Nothing lives or dies here,
Just calumnies of matter onto the dark
It slips through our fingers,
Unperceiving the emptiness

We are burning the stellar fields

I rise through debris and the dust
Who is this sun?
A always spoke to the stars
A rise through debris and the dust
Who was this sun?
A always spoke to the stars

âRelease me from myself,
Fading back into the womb,
That stellar, ethereal tomb
Just waiting for my moment to matter
And consciousness slept inside the stars
And we must remember that we forget
Thereâs an immunity boundless ahead of it allâ

Further, always further from here
These memories are continuing
Ever onward before the dawn
Seeing as time we canât escape

Iâm drifting and fading and choking in here
These nightmares are continuing
Aching glimpses always in hiding
Iâm begging, begging you for hope

I stumble through the rugged door;
The crater of my being
Watching this heart graciously beating,
Until it beats no more

Interweave forever into your hunger
As gravity collapses and light torn asunder

We are burning the stellar fieldsâ¦

I rise through debris and the dust
Who is this god?
