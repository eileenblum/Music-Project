[Bonus Track]Awake in slumbering world
As structures outside cave in
So harbor us, sweet sorrow
This lonely, exquisite hollow

Oh, mother on conscious dark sailsâ¦
In your theatre of sirens, hears us!

They see weeping the newborn horizon
We are here split into two,
With love and defiance

From the distance they came, 
Covered in ash
Thereâs no hope in this lifeless void
Which aired of parasite tongues

Oh, mother on conscious dark sailsâ¦
In your theatre of sirens, hears us!

They see weeping the newborn horizon
We are here split into two,
With love and defiance

As a speck in the cosmic ocean you sail
Trapped in ill-shaped tales with your grin
And your gods of death

They see weeping the newborn horizon
We are here split into two,
With love and defiance

We see them weeping newborn horizon
They are here in spirit and flesh
With love and defiance
