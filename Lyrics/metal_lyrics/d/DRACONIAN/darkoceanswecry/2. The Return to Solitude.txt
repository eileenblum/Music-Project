[Lyrics by Anders Jacobsson, Oct 2001 &amp; Jan 2002]

Oh, the world makes me return, return to solitude.
Will hope ever come to the dark souls who wanders alone?

Hear my silent prayer as I weep tonight!
Dawn gets greyer, thou hast taken flight!

Love abandons the soil, leaves a shade...
It whispers 'goodbye' as we quietly fade... away!

The brightness fades in my eyes
but nightfall calms all my cries.
Please, give us wings to fly!
Without love our world dies... it dies!

To drown in the cold mournful sea...
So lost here in a world not meant to be... for me!

The fading moon cries in vain,
as the rising sun reflects my pain.
We sail on seas of guilt and shame,
but still we feed this love-lost flame... with hope!

Hear my silent weeping as I pray tonight...
Night grows colder, but I see a new light.

Beautiful night, to thee we pray;
Let the truest of love come our way!
Beautiful night, to thee we pray;
Let all the illusions just wither away!
