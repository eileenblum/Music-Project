[Lyrics by Anders Jacobsson, Summer 2002]

[Sample:]
"I know that light is not for me, save that of the moon (and the rock)... For I know always that I am an outsider; a stranger in this century... for a time..."
[from H.P. Lovecraft's 'The Outsider']

[Spoken verse:]
Dark oceans we cry... God wonders why...
but we see ourselves in darkness with our love.
Abandoned by time and space,
we are still alive, we are not alone.
We are one under the banner of the fallen angel!

[Sample:]
"Och nÃ¤r Lammet brÃ¶t det sjunde inseglet uppstod i himlen en tystnad som varade vid pass en halv timme. Och de sju Ã¤nglarna som hade de sju basunerna gjorde sig redo till att stÃ¶ta i sina basunerâ¦"
[sample from Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal, 1957]

[English translation:]
"When the Lamb broke open the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them."
[from The Bible, Book of Revelation]
