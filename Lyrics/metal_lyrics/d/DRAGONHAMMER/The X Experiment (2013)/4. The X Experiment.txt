More power to the machines
You must come back to live
Could you be hope for men?
But you are in my hands

Now you can feel the flames
You can feel your life rising

You are the experiment
The experiment x

I know you are the last
Your secrets from the past
You will follow my command
Like a soldier of your God

Now you can feel the flames
You can feel your life rising
