Now times are very hard
The dawn of a new era
I want to reset
Only one solution for the world

The sacred beast has escaped
I want to kill him
Because his life is the sign
What is our destiny?

I want to destroy without revenge
This is mv choice, war and pain
The last solution...

The last solution only one way
We are now killing your hope

It's too late to come back
There is no return
The dark side is calling me
Terrible destiny

I want to destroy without revenge
This is mv choice, war and pain
The last solution...
