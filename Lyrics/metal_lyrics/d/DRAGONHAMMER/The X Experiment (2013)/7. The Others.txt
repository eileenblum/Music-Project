I can't understand, maybe I belong to the others
I can't find different ways, lost inside my mind
Mercy, horrible truth, reality slammed in my face
Money and drugs, this is the law

Day after day, people cry and die
I don't see the light but I feel only pain
Creating fear of faith, you are falling down
Living in the dark, never more light

Blood and hate of the heart
Burn the rage of my heart

Every man kills to live, I'm learning this
All the men have a lost God
But I'm here...

Blood and hate of the heart
Burn the rage of my heart
