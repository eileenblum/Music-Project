I can't see the real things, scream inside of me
Shadows cover my eyes but I feel your touch, your hands
I don't know which is my world, trapped in my mind
Where is the hidden door to open and see die light

I'm blind but I see your face
I'm blind but I feel your age... so far

Save me from the darkness, gentle giant of the sky
Take me in your hands, you are my destiny

Lost rime in the oblivion, every day is agony
My power is my prison, studied by the science of war
Your soul, your soul's voice, words from your mind
This connection is a resurrection to brake this cage and run away

I'm blind but I see your face
I'm blind but I feel your age... so far
