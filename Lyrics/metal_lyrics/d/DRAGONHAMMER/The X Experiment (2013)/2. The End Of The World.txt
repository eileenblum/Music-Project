Two thousand sixty, year in the future
The world is going towards destruction
People are mad without the choice
To survive or die

Fire and tears are everywhere
Loosing faith for religions
Evil is fighting day by day
Suffering and pain

Destination and mistery of human life
Evil corporations are turning off the lights

You don't cry, men are loosing their way
You don't cry, now it's too late: the end of the world!

Sadness of ignorance and poverty
Economy doesn't exist
People don't believe in anything
We hope in some change

Destination and misterv of human life
Evil corporations are turning off the lights

Dreams erased from reality
New brains condemned without defence
We are writing the book of the end
Children of defeat

Destination and mistery of human life
Evil corporations are turning off the lights
