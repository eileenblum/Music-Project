The men want to kill me
Pain and tired inside my mind
To walk and run alone
Ancient rules casted in stone

Invisible fear
Disappear with the dark
In the smell of the night, you can see the sky
...Listen to me...

See the light in the black night
Call and follow your star

See the lights
