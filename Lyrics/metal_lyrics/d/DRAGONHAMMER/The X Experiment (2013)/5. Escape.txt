I see the frames of a story
Where the titans help the men
Angels from beyond
Battles in galactic space

I'm tired and confused
The poison runs in my veins
You want to know all my secrets
And you torture me again I wanna escape

Electric bites in my head
You lie to me, I'm a prisoner
This chain doesn't stop me
If I feel the force inside me
I wanna escape

Remember... your words are killing me
Surrender... you want my energy!

I wanna escape!
