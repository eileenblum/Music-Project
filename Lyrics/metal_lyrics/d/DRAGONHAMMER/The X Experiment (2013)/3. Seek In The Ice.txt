Time is gone to see the truth
Maybe it's all unreal
Stranger men of stranger lands
Seek in the ice

Energy's form from an ancient force
Danger for all the worlds
But I don't know if it's the right thing
Because I saw the light in his eyes

Inside the white mountain the secret lives
The future of humanity is here

A shadow sleeps lost in time
We are waiting for his return
The brain explodes loosing control
It's time to pray for your soul
