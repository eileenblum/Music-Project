The time of demons is coming back
Likely solution, the death of men

Mercy for no one
Slash and burn the Earth
I fetch my great sword
Because now...is war!

Blood in the sky, terrible sin
Welcome black star, sign for revenge
I want to survive, please God help me!
My scream of soul, it's ready for war!

Born from evil, dregs of the sky
Obscene slaves of the master of pain

Mercy for no one
Slash and burn the Earth
My almighty sword
May the blade of war shine!
