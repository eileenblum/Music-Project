Time
Time after time
I can't believe I will die
Steel
And blades on my way
I can't see the next day

Scream to the moon
I'm stranger to the world
Scream to the moon
I'm alone inside my soul
Scream to the moon
In the darkness of my life
I will survive!

Peace
When I see this flame
Many things make me insane
My life sacrificed for doom
I can't get you, I hate you!!

Scream to the moon
I'm stranger to the world
Scream to the moon
I'm alone inside my soul
Scream to the moon
In the darkness of my life
I will survive!
