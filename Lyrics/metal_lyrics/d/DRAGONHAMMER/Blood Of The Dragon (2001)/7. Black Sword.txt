When you enter this Empire
You see the other side
Other worlds are nothing, this is real!

When you step in my Empire
You feel the dark side
Visions of the truth, no more lies

The way to power is in my kingdom
Welcome to the slaughter, in your pain
Black sword...if you choose, darkness rules
Feel the evil flame...

You will learn the law of the Ancients
To accept the dark sign
Impressed in your brain, in your mind
Hear what I have to say
Give me your soul, in my name!
