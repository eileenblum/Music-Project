Fire and darkness are in my veins
The blood of the warriors killed by flames
My sword of hope is inside my heart
I feel the spirit of the storm

I am immortal, the witness of death
I've seen the sun rising over the sky
Evil and dark, are on my way
Steel of the blade, honour and blood

You're the enemy
I want to be free
I sharpen my blade, to strike your faith
Look at my eyes, I'm ready to fight
The blood of the Dragon
The Hammer, the Soul...

Cor dragonis
Fulcrum belli
