I can't survive every day
I hope to live in my way
Destiny awaits for me
You are my choice, inside me

I see the moon, I see my shadow
I feel the moon, I feel my shadow

Feel in your mind, in your heart
My energy for you
Take my light, take my life
My eyes want your eyes
Understand my desire, the flames give me pain
Take my light, take my life
My eyes want your eyes

I can't survive every day
I hope to see all my way
The winds of war call me
My spirit feels heart and steel
