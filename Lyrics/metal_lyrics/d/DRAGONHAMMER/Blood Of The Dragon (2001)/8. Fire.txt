Open your mind, because you're a warrior
Now is the time, demons of all fears

Lost fantasy of eternal life
Of an eagle in the sky

Like a free wolf, win or lose your head
The sword in your hand, the battle is coming

Lost fantasy of eternal life
Of an eagle in the sky

Fire in your eyes
Running in the fire
In this night
Kill for your life

Smoke over the line, running on dead bodies
Ice in your breath, the battle is coming

Lost fantasy of eternal life
Of an eagle in the sky

Fire in your eyes
Running in the fire
In this night
Kill for your life
