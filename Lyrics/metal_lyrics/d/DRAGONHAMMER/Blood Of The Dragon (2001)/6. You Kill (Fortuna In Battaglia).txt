Time goes by through my hand
Nothing of you remains
Cage and bars
Cage and bars between us

Differences you will not bend
I canât understand
Your darkest potency
I believe in my dreams

Hammer of honour
Crushes you
In the name of humanity
Anger takes me away from hypocrisy
I believe in my dreams

You kill
All my dreams
You kill
My soul screams
You kill
Agony
