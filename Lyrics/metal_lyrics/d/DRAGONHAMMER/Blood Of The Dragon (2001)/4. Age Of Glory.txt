Lost in time, over the line
This is the age of glory
Your life for my life
Dying in the night
You want my energy

Agony
When you are falling down
Broken swords
Can you feel my temptations?
Look at my eyes
My spirit flies in the sky

The word of the blade, to open the gates
When the dark is descending
The battle to win, slashing the skin
You and your enemy!

Agony
When you are falling down
Broken swords
Can you feel my temptations?
Look at my eyes
My spirit flies in the sky
