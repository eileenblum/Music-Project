My damned soul feels the shadows
Galaxy and Universe
I don't understand the life of men
My existence is Legend!

Take my sword
For everyone
Blood of the warriors on Earth

The rules of the steel for men and Kings
Burn my soul and justice for all
Open your eyes, the dark in the light
The law of the war:
Kill or die!

Another time, and other lands
You can't find sweet innocence
Eternal contrast, creation and death
When you live into Legend!
