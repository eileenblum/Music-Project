[Aguzzi]

Old guilts, modern lies
When the desert will arrive
Souls marked by the birth
Hungry children of this life

Different cultures, distant worlds
It's a matter of points of view
What to eat... Which car to buy... What child to save...

[BRIDGE]
Why? It is hard for me, I can't believe it
Why? The world is strange
In what we've to believe?

[CHORUS]
Blind, life and dreams, life and sleep
In the house of blind justice
Blind, life and dreams, life and sleep

Development, civilization
Hypnotized by television
All accuse, they all keep silence
Like a sterotype

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
