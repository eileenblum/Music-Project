[Aguzzi, Valdambrini]

I am the great sinner
Unforgiven from the death
Not alive and not death
In the oblivion of pain
I cannot interfere
Interdiction from the hell
I can feel your spirit
Show me your image

[CHORUS]
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me why?
To understand me
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me why?
To understand me
Can you tell me why?

Every soul in my mind
Sentenced for my crime
All the good and evil
Falling through my hands

[CHORUS]

I am the great sinner
Unforgiven from the death
Not alive and not dead
In the oblivion of pain

[CHORUS]
