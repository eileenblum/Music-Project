[Aguzzi]

Warm blood, flowed from the veins
You hoped in their suffering
God says: I forgive you
Hell awaits, are you ready?

[CHORUS]
You can't breathe
You can't fight
Trapped as your killed prayers
Now you will pay
Unforgiven
My sentence for your crime:
... You must die!

Sweat of the lips, the sign of your fear
No remorse, I will see your end
Electric lightning will take care of you
Wrong or correct... I have nothing more

[CHORUS]

Leather straps, shut your hands
Hypocrisy has disappeared
I wanna enjoy the fire of revenge
My life is destroyed, it's your turn now

[CHORUS]
