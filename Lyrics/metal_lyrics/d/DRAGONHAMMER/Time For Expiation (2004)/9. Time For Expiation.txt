[Aguzzi]

I'm waiting for the dawn
Lost in my confusion
I believe in your light
But I feel the breath of night

Can I justify to die?
What will be the price to pay?
Pandora's box is full
Oh God give me faith

[BRIDGE]
Time, penitence of...
Time, penitence of...
Time, penitence of...

[CHORUS]
Time, this is the time, heaven and hell
The time for expiation
Clouds in the brain, the bell's toll
Come on, time for expiation

Conscience of emotions
Children of corruption
Coming desolation
Who will save our soul?

Rising of corrosion
It's weight on my back
I must see your sign
Sin and absolution

[BRIDGE]
