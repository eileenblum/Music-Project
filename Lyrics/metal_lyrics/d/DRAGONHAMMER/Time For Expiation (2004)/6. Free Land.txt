[Aguzzi, Valdambrini]

Lost in time and in space
Modern evolution
Ancient rage, reluctance
With the revolution

[BRIDGE]
We could fly, be free
but today the sky dies
We could be all free
Wrong angels in lost heaven
This cruel destiny
Our future is under preassure
Of human egoism

[CHORUS]
Free land, Free land, Free land
I want to see ...Searching...
Free land, Free land, Free land
I want to see

Dreams chained to the past
When the flowers spoke to us
Arrivism and arrogance
Maybe now it's too late

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
