[Aguzzi]

Spirits live in the past
They must change, they must die
Golden years of human life
Other side in the time

Ancient lies, like the rain
Orphanage of the hate
Memories of the past
Untenable lightness

[BRIDGE]
Shine, I believe in time
I believe the things change like the flowers

[CHORUS]
You will ride on the way of life
No return from the shadow's country
You will ride on the way of life
No return from the shadow's country

Empty room in my heart
Other day, other rage
Can't you see in my dreams?
Untenable  brightness

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
