[Aguzzi]

This night, every night
In the dark borns my pain
Losing innocence again

Behind the door, waiting for
When I will be punished
Deviations of madness
Oh father... Oh father... Oh father...

[CHORUS]
Broken heart, he touches me
I can see anything
Huge terror in my eyes
That's the fear of a child
Broken heart, he touches me
I can see anything
Huge terror in my eyes
That's the fear of a child

Obscene rules, silent scream
And I must be kind with him
But he'll castigate me
Oh father...  Oh father... Oh father...

[CHORUS]
