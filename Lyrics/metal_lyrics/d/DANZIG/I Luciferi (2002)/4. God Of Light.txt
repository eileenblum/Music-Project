I took the ride, I'm still alive
Come back to let you know just what it's like
Not scared to live, not scared to die
I couldn't get there 'til I dropped inside
Chaos in flames, I'm not afraid
It's the god of light inside

I took the ride, know what it's like
To let the snake god come alive
It's still alive, it never dies
It's the god of light inside
