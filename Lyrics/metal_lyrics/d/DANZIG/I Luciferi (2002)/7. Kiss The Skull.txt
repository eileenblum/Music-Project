Necklace of blood droplets mix with your kiss
Immense oblivion waits upon your lips
Black candle wax dropping down upon your skin

Stark conjures speaks a secret dialect
Shadow and light dance across a naked breast
Rosaries and henna runes hang around your waist

C'mon and kiss the skull

Sweet child of lacerations, hail praise to all thine
Sister of Lucifer coiled by your side
Unearthly delights long forgotten by design

C'mon and kiss the skull
