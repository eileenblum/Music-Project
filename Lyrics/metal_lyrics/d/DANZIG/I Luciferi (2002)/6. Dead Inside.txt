How does it feel when you're dead inside?
Lost someone to the other side
Felt so bad 'cause you didn't cry
Couldn't shed a tear 'cause you're dead inside
How does it feel when you're cold inside?
Emptiness constant at your side
Freezing every secret thought you hide
Motionless, frozen hell design

It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar

How does it feel when you're lost and blind?
Loneliness is your only guide
And how does it feel when you're black inside?
Numbness calls from your inner eye

It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
It feels vulgar
