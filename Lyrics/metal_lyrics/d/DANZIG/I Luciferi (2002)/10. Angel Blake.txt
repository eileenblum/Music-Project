Angel Blake lived by the lake
Threw her in and she floated like a snake
Cross the moors into their sleeping beds
Now Angel roams around inside the children's heads

Angel Blake collects the devil's skin
The girls all pull their dresses up so Angel can begin
Piece by piece, they bring the beastly thing
Growing brackish parts for Angel's doll of sin

Angel Blake lived by the lake
Threw her in and she floated like a snake
Tender face, face without a soul
Her witching hour strikes 13 angel calls
