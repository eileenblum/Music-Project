Blessed morning rays
Blessed ice
Kiss the hand that offers this
Kiss the hand that offers life

There's no one
Alone
Scream, "I'll always need you"
There's no love awakened
In your home

Oh, there's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
There's something out there alone
The coldest sun where I lie

Empty offering
That you hold
Kiss the hand that clings to life
Blessed cold

Oh, there's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
There's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
There's something out there alone
The coldest sun that I found
Coldest sun that I found
