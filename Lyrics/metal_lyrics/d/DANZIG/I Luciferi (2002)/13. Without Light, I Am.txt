I am soulless and proud
That I'm not like your kind
I delight in watching you drown
As this world drags you down

Down
Shine darkest star

Snake bone chain
Hugs your neck
Matters not
Your curse awaits

When you see me, stand aside
If I call you, pray to hide
Can you offer your last breath
Smile of blood, lips of death

Down
Shine darkest star

Without light, I am
