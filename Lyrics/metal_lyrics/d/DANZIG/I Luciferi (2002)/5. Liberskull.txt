Cold times remembered
Cold times, no more
Anger, my best friend
Kept close and honed

who calls now the wraith down
Life screams as the brain crowds

Cold stains of memory
creeps back for more

in my liberskull
cruel taste this memory
cold taste reborn
from all those who've never
felt the stain of cold
All things remembered

Ageless
Reborn
