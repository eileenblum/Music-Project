if the blackest heart you crave
For its uncanny nature
And the demon's love
You say
Is better left forsaken

And in the basking glow
Upon the break of dawn
Two riders
Will approach
Out of the shadows
Borne

Cold is the blackest heart you crave

It's the naked witch
I like
The kind you want to play with
It's the naked witch
I find
The kind you want to lay with
