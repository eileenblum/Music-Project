Feel the hunger, as it burns inside
Feel the hunger, you forgotten child
There's no one like you, as you wander blind
There's no one like you, can't you wonder why

You're in the dark and alone
All the voices raining down
Cold in the dark and alone
All the voices raining...

Feed your hunger, as it grows inside
Feed, you want me, you forgotten child
There's no one like you, as you wander blind.
There's no one like you, won't you wonder why

You're in the dark and alone
All the voices raining down
Cold in the dark and alone
All the voices raining...
