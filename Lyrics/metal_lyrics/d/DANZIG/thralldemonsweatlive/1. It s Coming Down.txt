god and life
they don't come free
crown of thorns
strung through their teeth
it's coming down
it's coming down
it's coming down
it's coming down
sin and sweat
they taste so sweet
comes the rush
an angel screams
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
yeah
love and death
they don't come clean
crown of thorns
to make you bleed
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
it's coming down
i'm on fire and i need a hole
it's coming
