if you're looking for trouble
you came to the right place
if you're looking for trouble
just stare in this face
i was born looking out
from my momma's sack
my daddy was the
demon werewolf jack
because i'm evil
my middle name is misery
said i'm evil, child
yeah, don't you mess around with me
never look for trouble
and i never am
i don't take no orders
from no kind of man
i'm only made out of
flesh and blood
but if you're looking on
some trouble
why don't you try it on your own
because i'm evil
my middle name is misery
said i'm evil, child
yeah, don't you mess around with me
yeah
and i'm evil
my middle name is misery
well i'm evil, child
yeah, don't you mess around with me
i said i'm evil
i said i'm evil
i said i'm evil, evil, evil, evil, woah
don't mess around, don't mess around with the evil
i said i'm evil
i said i'm evil, evil, evil, evil, woah
don't mess around, yeah, dont' mess around with my evil
i said i'm evil
