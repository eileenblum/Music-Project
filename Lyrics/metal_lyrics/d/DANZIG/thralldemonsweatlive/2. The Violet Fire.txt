did you know
i would come if you spoke my name
did you lie
when you said you needed the cool
of the night
to caress your deepest thoughts
i can hear
all the darkest things you think
i'm gonna make it easy
i'm gonna make it easy
i'm gonna make it easy
did you smile
as i wandered in the black
of your eyes
now i live among the things
that we see
and the darkest things you fear
i'm gonna make it easy
i'm gonna make it easy
i'm gonna make it easy
violet fire
cold in your arms
kiss me, oh
cold violet fire
violet fire
cold in your arms
kiss me, oh
cold violet fire
i'm gonna make it easy
i'm gonna make it easy
i'm gonna make it easy
violet fire
cold in your arms
kiss me, oh
cold violet fire
violet fire
cold in your arms
kiss me, oh
violet fire
violet fire
cold in your arms
kiss me, oh
violet fire
violet fire
cold in your arms
kiss me, oh
violet fire
