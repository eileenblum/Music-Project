Hordes of faces
Empty eyes
I see nothing new
Seasoned schemes of slimy curs
Offer up their flu
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you
Am I demon
You need to know
Faces of a million hells
Rage inside these veins
Pounding out desrved pain
To anyone in need
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you
Am I demon
Need to know
Am I demon
Need to know
Every world
And every limb
Torn asunder base
Everything I need is me
Everything I am
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you
Am I demon
You need to know
Am I demon
Need to know
