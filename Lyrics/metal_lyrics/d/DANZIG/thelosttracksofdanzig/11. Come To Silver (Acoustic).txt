Come to silver
Come to gold
Come to do anything
Sell your body and soul
Make you kill a man
And ruin your soul
Come to silver
Come to gold

Come to silver
Just as hard as you can
Come to do anything
For a life of sin
You can have everything
Big house up on a hill
Come to silver
Come to kill

Come downhearted
Come to gold
It'll make you lose your way
Turn your heart so cold
Steal the wife of another man
Let money buy her love
Gonna be some hardtime
If you come to gold

If you come to silver
If you come to gold
I hope that you're happy
With the life you've sown
You could had everything
But you didn't want to know
You had to come to silver
You had to come to gold

You had to come to gold
You had to come to gold
You had to come to gold
