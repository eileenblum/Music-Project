White
Devil
Rise

You speak my name, I do not mind
To give me credit is so kind
I'm flattered that I have your fear
You wake the sleeping demon here

Rise

I hear the lies
Brotherhood at my side
You call me white, you bet I am
Now see my beast rise up in flames

White

Stare at the ashes of the ages
Stand the devil up inside
Pray to a god that cannot help you
My beast will feast upon his eyes
