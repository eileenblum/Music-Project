Since I was a child
Lay awake at night
Talking to my darkened world
'Til the morning light
Serve my time upon this earth
Angel to my side
In and out among the thieves
Serve this place to die

Come unto me
Soothe my hurting pain
Come unto me
Soothe my hurting pain

Jackal at the heels of life
Seventh day of dying
To and fro' on God's green death
Nothing left alive

Come unto me
Soothe my hurting pain
Come unto me
Soothe my hurting pain

Angel of the seventh dawn
Angel of the seventh dawn
To my side
And until dawn
Angel of the seventh dawn

Serve this world to suffer
Serve this world to die
Serve the earth to be in pain
Serve this bleeding
