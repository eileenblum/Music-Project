Lick the blood off my hands little darling
Lick the blood off my hands little go-go girl
Lick the blood off my hands little darling
Easy

Lick the blood off my human altar
Lick the blood off my human altar girl
Lick the blood off my human altar
Easy

The whore you ride
Hid up inside
The sorcerer will come
The winged rain
The amber red
A force you can't control

Lick the blood off my hands little darling
Lick the blood off my hands little demon girl
Lick the blood off my hands little darling

Bleed it all down
Bleed it all down
Bleed it all down
Bleed it all down

The whore you hide
Deep down inside
Will never be denied
The breath you take
Make no mistake
Will ease your restless nights

Lick the blood off my hands little darling
Lick the blood off my hands little go-go girl
Lick the blood off my hands little darling
Bleed it all down
Bleed it all down
Bleed it all down
Bleed it all down
