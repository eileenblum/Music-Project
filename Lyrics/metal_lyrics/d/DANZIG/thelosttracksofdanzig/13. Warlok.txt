warlock stole her soul away
because she broke her vow
didn't play her witch's game
and so he took her down

he calls you forever and ever
he calls you forever and ever
he'll drag you forever and ever down

warlock took her life away before he left this town
never knew just how she'd died
he won't be back around

he calls you forever and ever
he calls you forever and ever
he'll drag you forever and ever down
[repeat]
