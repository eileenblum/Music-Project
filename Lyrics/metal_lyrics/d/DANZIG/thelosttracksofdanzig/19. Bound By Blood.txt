I'll never lead you to burn
Or set you straight from you town
Now forever were

Bound By Blood

And if you find yourself cold

Just check your warmth for my words Im always with you

were bound by blood
bound by blood
bound by blood

I'll never lead you to harm
Never leave you to fear
Im always with you

Were Bound By Blood

And If you wander alone
Never be by yourself
Im always with you

Were Bound By Blood
Bound By Blood
Bound By Blood

Bound By Blood X16
