Cold, cold rain
In my eyes
You'll see a sad reflection

Come the rain
All alone
I'm feeling

There's no end
To the pain
I'm feeling left behind me

All I've felt
In my heart
I'll miss you

I can try to wipe away the pain
It won't let go

There's got to be some place
I can call my home
There's got to be some place

Cold, cold rain
In my eyes
The stinging still reminds me

Cold, cold rain, yeah
All my life
Forever

I can try to wipe away the pain
It won't let go
