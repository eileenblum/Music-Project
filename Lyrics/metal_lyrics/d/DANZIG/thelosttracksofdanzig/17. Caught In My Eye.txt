[originally by The Germs]Through your dark eyes
You can feel my every sin
When I walk right into a straight line 
This world of yours

Well, I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye, eye, eye
Well, I got you caught in my eye, again

You're the fall guy 
In the corner of my gloom
And it feels like everything I see 
Is nothing new

Well, I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye, eye, eye
Well, I got you caught in my eye, again

I got you caught in my eye
Well, I got you caught in my eye, eye, eye
Well, I got you caught in my eye, again

There's a door there
That opens without you 
And the door lies 
With it's open keys 
To my room

You're the fall guy 
In the corner of my gloom
And it feels like everything I see 
Is nothing new

Well, I got you caught in my eye
I got you caught in my eye, eye, eye
Well, I got you caught in my eye, again

I got you caught in my eye
Well, I got you caught in my eye, eye, eye
Well, I got you caught in my eye, again
