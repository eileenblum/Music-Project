there in the corner
lying so still
over there
time waits for no one, and it never will
dying seraph

and even you once shined so bright
now a dimming, dimming fallen star

I wish you could see
what I see now
I wish you could see
what I see now
but you never will

you won't need love
alone now where you are

close your eyes, close your eyes
say goodnight
to the world

messenger of god
so still and warm
yeah, you know

your message forgotten
long time ago
there once was a brighter star
but it's all burned out now

I pluck another feather
from your crest of dawn
and you sigh
gonna die

you won't need love
alone now where you are

you won't need love
alone now where you are
