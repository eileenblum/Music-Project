Don't you ever call upon things you shouldn't play with
Don't you ever look upon things that might offend you

Say what they don't like
Say what they don't like

Don't you ever, no
Don't ever call the unspeakable
Don't you ever, no
Don't ever call the unspeakable

Say what they don't like
Say what they don't like

Don't you ever question God or question how to pray
Don't you ever question laws, question what they say

Say what they don't like
Say what they don't like

Don't you ever, no
Don't ever call the unspeakable
Don't you ever, no
Don't ever call the unspeakable
Don't you ever, no
Don't ever call the unspeakable
Don't you ever, no
Don't ever call the unspeakable
The unspeakable
