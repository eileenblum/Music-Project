truth is that you're near
laugh is all on you
now you're so alone
and nothing you can do

yeah
I know your lie
[repeat]

bled yourself too long
fall is all too true
the master calls the hand
payment now come due

yeah
I know your lie
[repeat]

false friends all depart
your emptiness arrives
the world you made is gone
your hollow lullaby

yeah
I know your lie
[repeat]
