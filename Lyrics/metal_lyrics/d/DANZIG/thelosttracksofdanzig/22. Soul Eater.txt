Black, black 
The black is back
I am the blackest of the black of time.

Down dark
You know who I am
And you know just where I stand

Yeah I can roll
Get into your face
It's just what you need

And I can smile
A hundred different ways
You take the one you please.

Then call me
Here I am
But you remain
Just remember that I got your soul
Got your soul
Got your soul

Bad seed in the base of your skull
I'm here to help it grow.
(You wanna) Pitchfork and presidents
Well I can make you choke

Then you call me
Here I am
But you remain
Just remember that I got your soul

[inaudible]
.....I use 'em all and I got your soul
I got your soul [3x]

Black, black 
The black is back
I am the blackest of the black of time.

Down dark
You know who I am
And you know just where I stand

And it's coming
Here I am
But you remain
Just remember that I got your soul

And it's coming
Here I am
But you remain
Just remember that I got your soul
