sleep the deep nocturnal lullaby
sleep the deep nocturnal lullaby
I'm out listening for the mandrake's cry, tonight

born in the light of a dying sun
free when the night has just begun, now

drift into the sleep of no return
drift until you reach another realm
I'm out walking til the mandrake screams tonight

born in the light of a dying sun
free when the night has just begun, now

oh...sleep tonight
drift to the sleep of no return

sleep the deep nocturnal lullaby
sleep the deep nocturnal lullaby
I'm out listening for the mandrake's cry, tonight

born in the light of a dying sun
free when the night has just begun
born in the light of a dying sun
free when the night has just begun
