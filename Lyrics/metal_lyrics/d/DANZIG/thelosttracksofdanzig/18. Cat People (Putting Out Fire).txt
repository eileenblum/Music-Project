[originally by David Bowie]See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Don't you know my name
Can't you see it's been so long?

See these tears so blue
This ageless heart can never mend
Tears will never dry
Judgement made can never bend

It's been so long
It's been so long

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and hide in fear

Still this pulsing night
This plague they call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You can't believe what I've been through

It's been so long
It's been so long

And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline

Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long

Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long
