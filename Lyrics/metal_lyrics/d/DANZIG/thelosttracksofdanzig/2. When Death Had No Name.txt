When death had no name
Time stood still
Life had no ending then

Before the word
There was no end
No fear, no mortal pain, no name
Nothing

And this thing mortals fear
Dubbed evil, hungry
Waiting to no avail
Withering

Life without an end
Death without a name
Without a name

And our Eden burns in flames
Can our Eden still remain
Still remain

Can you really make it end, yeah

And this thing mortals fear
Dubbed evil, hungry
Waiting to no avail
Withering

Life without an end
Death without a...

When death had no name
Time stood still
Life had no ending then, yeah
