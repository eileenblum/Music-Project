All you who stand before the dawn
All you who wander paths of scorn
Black cross that casts a shadow fall
All you who stand before the dawn

Satan's cross points to hell
Satan's cross points to hell

All you that brave the harshest rains
All you that feed upon the pain
Black cross burned into your brain
All you that play the endless day

Satan's cross still points to hell
Satan's cross points to hell

Satan's cross points to hell
Satan's cross points to hell
