Know you have a problem
Can't you figure it
Suddenly your lost alone
As your statue splits

Now you walk this cruel world
Lost among its pain
See all you were in my world
Never to regain

So you misbegotten
Love so quickly fades
So to be forgotten
Tuned a grayer shade

See all you were in my world
See all you were in mine

Now you know possession
Million souls to steal
Every night your death awaits
Less and less to feel
