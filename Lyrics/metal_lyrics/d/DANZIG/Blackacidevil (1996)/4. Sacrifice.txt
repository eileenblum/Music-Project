I want to bring you
I want to feel alive in you
I want to bathe in the danger of ourselves
I want to feel you

I want to take you
Carve a new design in you
I want to look in your other face

But it's so damn hard to find

I want to bring it
I want to bring it
I gotta feel all sacrificed
I gotta feel all sacrificed
I'll never let you know

I want to peel it back
I want to look inside
I want to see the inscriptions glow
Where your teardrops crawl

Under the downward side
I was the death you beg to hold
Now you have the thing that you wanted most
You can never own
