Come to silver
Come to gold
Come do any old thing
Sell your body and soul

Make you kill a man
Ruin your soul
Come to silver
Come to gold

Come to silver
Just as hard as you can
Come do anything

For life of sin

You can have everything
Big house up on a hill
Come to silver
Come to kill

Come downhearted
Come to gold

It'll make you lose your way
Turn your heart so cold
Steal the wife of another man
Let money buy her love
Gonna be some hard time
When you come to gold

If you come to silver
If you come to gold
Hope that you're happy
With the life you've sown

Coulda had everything

But you didn't want to know
You had to come to silver
You had to come to gold
