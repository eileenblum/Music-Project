And the burning of the embers
Slowly down inside
I will keep you warm this darkness
As the ashes die

I will call your soul in winter
I will keep you mine
I will call your soul and winter
As the ashes die

I will keep you broke and splintered
I will keep you tight
I will keep you cold and dark
Till the end of time

And the soul is slowly seeping
As the years go by
Will you keep me cold and darkened
Till the end of time

I will keep you safe from summer
I will be entwined

I will keep you cold and darkened
Till the end of time

I will kiss your burning embers
I will watch them die
I will watch your soul escaping
As the ashes fly
