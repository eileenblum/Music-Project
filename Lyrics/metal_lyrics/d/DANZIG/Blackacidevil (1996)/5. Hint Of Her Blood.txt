Another hollow face
Another dreamless state
Another whispered cry
A love that died
A hollow face

Another diamondback girl
Another death in the world
Another open wound
A bleeding smile
The diamond girl

Another demon heart
I've got to kiss it quick
'Cause if I linger too long
My soul is gone
The devil denied

Oh it's on
With a hint of her blood
She goes
Oh it's on
With the speed of a gun
She's off

Another dead embrace
A big kiss of mace
Another rush of hell
Makes me start to swell
Another dead embrace
Another dead embrace

A glance of evil grace
A look of mock disgrace
Another soulless dance
Where minds collide
Another devil denied
Another devil denied
