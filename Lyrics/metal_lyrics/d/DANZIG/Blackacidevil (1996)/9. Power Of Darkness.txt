Rape the garden of infernal delights
Rack your body on the left and the right
Like you're floating on a river of pain
Thirsty knife and hungry brain

Rip your body on the left and the right
Take your body to another plane
Rape the garden of infernal delights
Wrap the snake in between your legs

You want the power of rebellion
You want it thrust inside

You want the power of dissension
You want it thrust inside
You want the power of darkness
It cannot be denied

The darkness is the power in light
Cannot be denied
That darkness is the power of light
Blessed be the black
