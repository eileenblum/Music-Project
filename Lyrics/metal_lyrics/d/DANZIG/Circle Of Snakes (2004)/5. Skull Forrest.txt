Death-type dreaming hoping not fade away
And i'm sinking ever deeper
In the gleaming
And i'm weaving down thru alleys of bone
Dermal dripping
Trees of people still it lingers
And it's endless winding long corridors
Of the bleaching
And the grinning never frowning

Skull forrest
And i see them haunting skinless forlorn
Swaying demons eyeless creatures
Hearts still beating
There the fallen thickets row after row
Dangling helpless damned and woeful
Still they glisten
Then the faces staring that i have known
All the parted
All the missing
Here to greet me

Skull forrest
