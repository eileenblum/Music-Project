1000 devils reign
Up from the western shores
1000 seasons smile
Upon the bleeding horns
Ones that you are
1000 devils reign

1000 devils scream
Into the violent skye
A sea of angels fall
Floods of feathers fly
1000 devils die
And die another night
To let the anger grow
So they can split the skies
Ones that you are
1000 devils reign

1000 futures end
Upon the eastern shores
1000 devils reign
And reign forever more
Ones that you are
1000 devils reign
