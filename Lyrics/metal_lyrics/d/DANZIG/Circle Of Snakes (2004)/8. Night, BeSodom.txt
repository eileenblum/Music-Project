She brings her sleepless sex
From babylon
She sends her hallowed name
On wings of flame
Don't ever think she's powerless in ways of love
She only craves the things of sin and lust
Night
Besodom

She lets her blackness fall
Bewitched mane
She steals into all dreams
And clouds all gaze
Don't ever think she's powerless while drawing blood
She only cares for things of sin and lust
Night
Besodom

We bring thee hollow things
Come bring me love
Come witch initiate
Sway back and forth (?)
Oh take no holiday
From drawing blood
We bring thee offering
Of open veins
