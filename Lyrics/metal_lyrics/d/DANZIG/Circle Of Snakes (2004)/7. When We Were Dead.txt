We were blind to the light
We were numb to the world
And the breath of the still
Sent a chill thru the days
And the hell of your eyes
And the cracks on your lip
And the cold of your breath
Makes me remember
When we were dead

Now the days never end
There is no sleep for the dead
We are abandoned interred
We are the lost other world
And the hell of your eyes
And the cracks of your lips
And the cold of your breath
Makes me remember
When we were dead
