Your forever blinding guile
Your forever stained
Your forever nether bound
Forever slaked
And the world is ours
Let the others die
And we shine eternal
We can touch the skies
Cause we're nether bound

Your forever discontent
Your forever stamped
Your forever malevol
Paradise regained
Let the others die
And we shine immortal
We have touched the skies
Cause we're nether bound
