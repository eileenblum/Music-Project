A grain of bane
The secret name
Caress of scales up and down your leg
Unholy dream
A flick of the tongue
Scent of seraphs breathing down your neck
Blackrock
Spirals down this reptile highway
Writhing like a devil
Ride like the devil

Writhe around your face like a circle of snakes
Halfway to hellbent
Halfway to hell
Halfway to hell
Halfway to hellbent

A lok of strix
Matted mane
Another nyx with the mark of cain
Nagalist
A coiled charm
Grip of vipers coiling up your arm
