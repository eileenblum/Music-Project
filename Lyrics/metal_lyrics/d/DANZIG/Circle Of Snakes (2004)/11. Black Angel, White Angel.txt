We've lost the light another night
Kill these days and make them go away
Skulls on fire
The burning faces know iall hope is gone
Would you lie in wait or
Would you kill your brother
Would you offer out your hand
Then unleash the dagger

Black angel, white angel
Kneel down and lick from the razor
Dark angel, light angel
Come down and lay in the danger

You've lost your way among the fray
The blackest days
Are waiting up ahead
Blazing skulls
The burning children know it's all a game
Would you die in pain or
Would you feed the maelstrom
Would you offer up the necessary soul
