I saw you
Inside yeah
My darkness
Alive
You don't sleep 
You don't cry
You don't smile unless someone dies
Wanna see thr horns rise up and down
Wanna creepy-crawl across your town
Wanna see the shadows come to life

You don't dream
You don't feel
You don't fear what lies underneath
Wanna see the horns rise up and down
Wanna creepy crawl across your town
Wanna send a chill into the night
Wanna see the shadows come to life
