Razed infernal hell reborn
Gaze unhallowed eyes of stone
Face of fire face of death
Mask of devils beast enraged
Stare of darkness smile of flames
Untold secrets hate regained
Killing grimace black abyss
Jaws of hunger murder kiss

Welcome to my labyrinth of pain
Know that you may never come again
Is the curse too much to bear
Step beyond here if you dare
