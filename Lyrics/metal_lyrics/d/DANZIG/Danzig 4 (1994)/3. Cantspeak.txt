Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't do anything they want

Can't hide
Or change your mind
Gonna live with all my soul
Inside

Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't stop for the reeling cause
Or love
I told 'em all about it
Can't talk
'cause I'm already lost

Can't think
Can't cry
Keep thinking of a suicide
It's hard
I just can't forget it
Gonna fade 'cause I'm already dead

Can't think
Can't dream
Don't care if I live or die
Don't talk
I just can't believe it
Gonna fade 'cause I'm already dead

Can't think
I cant dream
I don't believe anything I see
I really don't wanna get it
Gotta leave or I'll live to regret it

Can't speak
Can't lie
Don't go anywhere to hide
Can't think
Can't cry
Keep thinking of a suicide

Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't do anything I want
Can't hide
Or change your mind
Gonna live with all my soul inside

Can't speak
Can't talk
Can't do anything I want
Can't hide
Or change your mind
Gonna live with all my soul inside
