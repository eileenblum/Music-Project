If the heart is cold
If there is no light
I can be the one
If the the heart is cold
If the blood runs hot
Let there be an end
Let there be no one
Who can be the light

Where you go I won't lead

Cause if the heart is dead
I can take your soul
If you give it free
And the bondage end
Cause if your heart is cold
The you belong w/ me
Let me be the one
That will set you free

Where you go I won't lead

See how love unholy
Cuts into your mind
See how love unholy
Lies
