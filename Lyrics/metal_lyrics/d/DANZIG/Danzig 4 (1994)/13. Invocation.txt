[Bonus Track]The demon comes
But must be called
It comes to all the sleeping whores
It breaks the night and lifts their drawers
The demon comes
But must be called
The demon calls to me
At length
The demon has no other strength
Except to rend the stretching thighs
Of those whose fate it is
To die
The demon has
But one mistake
It lingers where he should not stay
It should not stay
But rather go
The demon has no soul
The demon has no soul
As such
Its breath is cold as winter's touch
Its hair the blackness of the night
The demon offers up
Its bite
The demon lives not life
We know
It lives
But is the nether born
Its eyes are of the blackest coal
The demon has no soul
Many are the demon's face
And many are
The forms he takes
Beware
That you don't bed you one
The demon comes
To anyone
