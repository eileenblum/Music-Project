You crawl across the floor
On your hands and knees
To seek revelation
Little whip
I pull you up
I grab your hair
I give you hope
Little whip
I give the black sun
To sear off your tounge
I gave you a life
Little whip
A come on little whip
A come on little whip
A come on little whip
A come on little whip

I pull you up
I grab your hair
I give you hope
Little whip
I gave you the world you beheld in a dream
I gave you a night cry
Little whip

You lick your wounds
And you come right back
I give you nothing
Little whip
I send the black sun
And eclipse your moon
I steal your hope
Little whip
