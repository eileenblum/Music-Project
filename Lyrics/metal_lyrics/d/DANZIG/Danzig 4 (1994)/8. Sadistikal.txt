Deep in your eyes
I know they lie
As the night must die
Every morning to give birth to the day
So must autumn die
To born a hatred
Until now unknown
Every hell I know I will make you feel
Deep, deep
Down you go
My love is your hell
To suffer and cherish
Deep, deep
Down in your soul
My love is your hell
Sadistikal
