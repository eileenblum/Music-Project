Do I need
Thoughtsso cold
Could I feel more alone
Am I more
Damned than thou
Should I wear tortures crown

Should I live my life a lie
Could I beless alive
Shall I bask in god's light
Shall I fall
One more time

Should I feel lost
Somehow
Do I feel less than thou
Could I be
Less undone
Could I fall deeper down
