See the devil kiss the hand of god
See the devil crying tears of flame
See the devil bite the hand of christ
And know the devil is the work of god

And all the devils do the work of god
In this season of the world's demise
Upon the wings of the fallen dream
I hear the sound of a bleeding mind
Bringer of death
Bringer of death

The angels smile is a smile of shame
Theybring the tortures that infest the earth
See the warlords of heavenly rank
And know that war is the will of god
Bringer of death
Bringer of death
