I am a walking
Screaming hell
A thing of torture to behold
This vivisection
Splits my soul
A thing of torture to behold

Where you run to
Won't take too long
I've come to get you
Won't take too long
And death should know we

No hesitating
Give up your heart
It ain't so lonely
W/o your heart
And death should know we
My hands are dirty w/ his blood

And I can take you there
I've got a brand new god
And if I lay you there
Under my brand new god
Then I will slay you there
For my brand new god

Where are you running to
It didn't take too long
I've come and gone now
You didn't take too long
And death should know we
My hands are dirty w/ his blood
And death should know we
After all
I prepared you for
The second coming
Of my god
