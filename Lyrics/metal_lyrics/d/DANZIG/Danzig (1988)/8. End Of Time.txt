[Lyrics: Glenn Danzig]

The suffering's here
The wait is gone
The streets are filled
Wiath a hollow song
Got a new death
It lurks outside
Follows me home
Waiting for me

Lost your sould
Dommed and cold
Yea
Lost your sould
Doomed and cold
Yea

A hum in the ear
Numbmness comes
Feeling like you're almost home
The open amrs
Tempting embrace
It's always been
Waiting

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too
Yea

The suffering's here
The wait is gone
The streets are filled
Wiath a hollow song
Empty world
Of listless night
I pray to thee
I suffer blind

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too
Yea

Lost your soul
Dommed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Right

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too
Yea

Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
