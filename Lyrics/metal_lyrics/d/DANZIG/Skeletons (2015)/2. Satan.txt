[Theme From "Satan's Sadists"][originally by Paul Wibier]I was born mean
By the time I was two
They were calling me
Calling me Satan

I was born mean
By the time I was twelve
I was killing
Killing for Satan

Yes my mother, she had problems
Too manyâ¨, oh
She was young and everybody's girl
Ah, yes she was

As a child, oh
I was lost, so lost and lonely
In a dark and godforsaken world
Oh, no one cared

What did anyone give
What chance did I have
To relive

I was born mean
By the time I was two
They were calling me
They called me Satan

Oh my mother, she had problems
Too manyâ¨, oh
She was young and everybody's girl
Ah, yes she was

As a child, I was lost
I was lost, so lost and lonely
In a dark and godforsaken world
Oh, no one cared

What did anyone do?
What chance did I have
To relive

I was born mean
By the time I was two
They were calling me
Calling me Satan, oh yeah

I was born mean
By the time I was twelve
I was killing
Killing for Satan, oh yeah

I was born
