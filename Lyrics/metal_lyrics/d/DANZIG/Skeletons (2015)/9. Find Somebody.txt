[originally by The Rascals]You shouldnât wear the face of sorrow
You must take ups and downs in stride
A brighter day might come tomorrow
Your dream-world door will open wide

Youâd better go and find somebody to love
Youâd better go and find somebody that needs somebody
To love somebody like you

Now, if you think thereâll be no other
Just change your mind, it isnât so
Open your heart and youâll discover
You will see things you did not know

Youâd better go and find somebody to love
Youâd better go and find somebody that needs somebody
To love somebody like you

Ha!
Ah

The shadow of a fallen angel
Will follow everywhere you go
If once the light of love is able
It will set all your dreams aglow

Youâd better go and find somebody to love
Youâd better go and find somebody that needs somebody
To love somebody 
I want somebody like you
