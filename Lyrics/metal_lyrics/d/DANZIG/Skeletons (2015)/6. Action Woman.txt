[originally by The Litter]Hey, Miss High and Mighty
I've had all I can take
Walkin' right on by me
That's your last mistake

I've gotta find myself some action
To satisfy my soul
A little satisfaction
Before I lose control

You say you love me good
But why are you so cold?
You say you own the world,
But you don't own my soul.

A little competition, now
Maybe that'll wake you up,
Stir up some ambition, yeah
And really shake you up.

Yeah! Oh!

I'm gonna find me an action woman
To love me all the time,
A satisfaction woman
Before I lose my mind.

Yeah, I'm gonna find me an action woman
To love me all the time,
A satisfaction woman
Before I lose my mind.

I'm gonna find me an action woman
A satisfaction woman!
I'm gonna find me an action woman!...
