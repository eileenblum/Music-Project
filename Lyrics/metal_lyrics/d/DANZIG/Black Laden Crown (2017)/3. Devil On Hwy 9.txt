Pedal to the metal on a thousand miles
Of the blackest road you can drive
Don't look to the left, don't look to the right
Keep your eyes on the fuckin' line

Demons stare as you blaze on by
All the faces of the dead and dyin'
Keep your hands on the wheel, make those tires peel
If you're gonna make this run alive

Devil on-
Devil on highway 9
Devil on-
Devil on highway 9
Devil on-
Devil on highway 9
Devil on-
Devil on highway 9

Devil to the metal, let that engine roar
Got a hundred miles left [to drive]
Keep your eyes on the line, don't you waste no time
And leave the CHiPs in your dust to cry

Devil on-
Devil on highway 9
Devil on-
Devil on highway 9
Devil on-
Devil on highway 9
Devil on-
Devil on highway 9
