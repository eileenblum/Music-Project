Blackness falls across your face
Never fails to leave a trace
Shadow cross, shadow [reign]
In the time it takes to [bleed]

Blackness falls upon your cheek
Heal us strong and strip the weak
Daylight end and nighttime rise
On the scale of serpentine

Blackness seeps into your blood
Slithers in thick as mud
Blackest in, blackest out
Yeah you know, it's all about-

Blackness drips into your eyes
Wipe the tears, bleeding smile
Shadow cross, shadow die
Like the tongue- serpentine
