Lay you down, lay you dead
No more tears, no more breath

And the numbness chills my side
And then there's nothing till the sunlight cries

The glazing eyes all full of flies
And then there's nothing till the sunlight ride

And when you walk that veil of night
And you're too numb to realize
That you're going out on your last ride

And I'm lonely when the world has died
And I'm killing time down on my last ride
And I'm lonely when the world has gone and died

And I'm lonely when the world has died
Yet I'm killing time down on my last ride
Fuck I'm lonely when the world has come and died

And I'm born to take that ride
And I'm born to take that ride
And if I'm gonna see that light
Just killing time on my last ride

And I'm born to take that ride
And I'm born to take that ride
And if I'm gonna see that light
Just killing time on my last ride
