Deep in the warmth of the Devil's breast
That's where I live
Strong with my back to the darkened stone
Never end

Beyond the night
Beyond the veil
Beyond the mystery

Inside the dream
Inside the void
More than you'll ever need

Eyes ripping fire
Cold-burning stare, forever seized
Stone-faced messiah
One flash of light is all you'll see

Hot on the heels of the setting sun
That's where I live
Deep down inside of the blackest sun
Never end

Beyond the night
Beyond the veil
Beyond the mysteries

Inside the dream
Inside the void
More than you'll ever need

Eyes ripping fire
Cold-burning stare, forever seized
Stone-faced messiah
One flash of light is all you'll see
