Down Louisiana
Alligator roam and prey
Tonton bring the nighttime
Baron Samedi

[Girl'a Gina Lonely]
Ain't got her no man
Wouldda like to come and see her bloody dance
Wouldda like to come and see her bloody dance

Say that Creole girl
Hadda house up on a hill
Picking skulls and daisies
Voodoo dolls and sin

Name'a Gina Lonely
Ain't got her no man
Wouldda like to come and see her once again
Wouldda like to come and see her once again

Dagger through the heart'll drive you crazy
Dagger through the heart drive you insane
Spirits of the night can make you lonely
Dagger through the heart drive you insane

Hey that Creole girl
Gotta house up on the hill
Picking skulls and daisies
Voodoo dolls and sin

Hey why Gina Lonely,
And she ain't got her no man?
And wouldda like to come and see her once again
Wouldda like to come and see her once again

Dagger through the heart'll drive you crazy
Dagger through the heart drive you insane
Spirits of the night can make you lonely
Dagger through the heart drive you insane

Dagger through the heart'll drive you crazy
Dagger through the heart drive you insane
Spirits of the night can make you lonely
Dagger through the heart drive you insane
