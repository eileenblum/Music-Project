And the clock strikes one
[A date] with the gun
Yeah the witching hour comes upon
All the waiting ones

And the hand strikes six
On the river Styx
And the witching hour long past dead
Raise a solemn drink

And the clock strikes eighteen
And it's nothing like you've ever seen
Cuz the witching hour's drawing near
Oh, your darkest fear

And the clock strikes one
[A date] with the gun
Yeah the witching hour comes upon
All the waiting ones

Morning star, light my way
Blackest light, keep me straight
Candle burn, light the skies
Hear my name, no more [hide]
