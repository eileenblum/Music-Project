I pull the sun into her eye
They've lost their glow, no surprise
Gray morning comes into your eye
I pull the sun down from the sky

I pull the stars out of the night
I give them to you until we die
See how they shine, no surprise
I pull the stars down from the sky

And it's [real]
Dead as well
And it's [real]
Dead as well

I wish the moon into your eye
See how it glows, no surprise
And all the tides shift in your mind
I blot the sun out for all time

And it's [real]
Dead as well
And it's [real]
Dead as well
