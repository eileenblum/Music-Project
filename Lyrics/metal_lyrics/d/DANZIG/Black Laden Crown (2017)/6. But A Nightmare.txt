I am but a nightmare lurking in your darkest dream
Creeping like a phantom as your breathing starts to sink
I am just a devil waiting for your pulse to slow
Patiently just waiting til your glow is never more
I am just a spectre floating right above your face
Siphoning your life force as your eyes begin to fade
I am but a devil, nothing more and nothing less
Preying on the weakest- harvesting the dead

I am but a nightmare living in your darkest dream
Creeping like a phantom as your breathing starts to sink
I am just a devil waiting for your pulse to slow
Waiting, ever waiting, waiting ever more!
