Hey my lady in black
Now I see you're back
Haven't seen you for a while

Kinda miss your deadly smile
On a windy night
On a windy night
On a wicked night
On a wicked night
Hey my lady in death
Have you come for my last breath?

I never thought
That we were through
I bet you knew I knew it too
I never thought
That we were through
I bet you knew that I knew it too

On a windy night
On a windy night
On a wicked night
On a wicked night
