Here's a song about a little girl
That give me some trouble
So I had get me some help
From a little thing called a
Ju ju bone

Gon' get my ju ju bone
Put you right
Gon' get my ju ju bone
Take you down

Girl I think you got trouble
Girl I think that it's time
Gon' get my ju ju bone
Take you down

What in the hell
Wanna make a man
Have to break you off a little some
Of my ju ju bone

How many time
Wanna make a man
Take out his ju ju bone
Girl I think you got trouble
Girl I think that it's time
Gon' use me my ju ju bone
And take you down
