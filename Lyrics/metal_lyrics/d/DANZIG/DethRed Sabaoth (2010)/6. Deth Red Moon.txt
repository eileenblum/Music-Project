Long are the twisted vines
Growing and gnarled inside
Look and you'll find
That they never die
Long are the twisted vines

Deth red moon
Going down
Deth red moon
Burning down

Cold is the wailing night
Gone are the tranquil skies
Look 'round you'll see
All the longing eyes
Cold is the wailing night

And there's no escaping
From this hell it's making
And there's no escaping
Now
