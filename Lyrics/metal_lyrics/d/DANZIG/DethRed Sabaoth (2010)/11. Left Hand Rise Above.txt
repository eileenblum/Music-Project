L.H.P.
Is the road I'm on
If you'd like
You can come along
Just make sure
That it's what you want
And your will
Is strong

The brightest star
You see
Must always
Be thee
The greatest thing
You know
Comes not from above
But below

Left hand rise above

Silver flame
At my beck and call
Light the night
Of this phantom world
Secret things
That I come upon
And the veil is gone

The brightest star
You see
Must always
Be thee
The greatest thing
To be
Is to be strong
And free

Left hand rise above
