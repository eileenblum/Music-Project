I was born from wisdom in chains
I was bathed
In thunder and lightning
Fire hell
Brimstone and rain
Riding out the seasons of pain

I am born time and again
I'm the wind and rain in your face
I was raised
By anger in flames
Hell you say
That is my name

I have drunk the blood of the dread
Out to put an end to their game
Feeding on an angel's remains
Dead I say
That is their name

I am the wind and rain in your face
Living on the seasons of pain
Riding out the death of an age
Hell you say
That is my name

Hell is my name
