I am dreams refined
Cult without a name
And it won't be long
Come another age
I am the beast devised
Face without a name
Yeah

I am teeth of fire
Taste a thousand shames
I am bleak desire
Known throughout the days

And if you wanna call on me
I'll hear your every word
And if you wanna play with me
I'll set you up to burn

I am speech denied
Cult without a name
I am street designed
Cult without a name

Ooh Cult without a name
Ooh Cult without a name
Ooh Can you feel it
Ooh Can you reach down

Yeah

I am beast inside
Demon in my veins
I am speech denied
Thoughts enslaved and chained

And if you wanna howl with me
I'll show you how to pay
And if you wanna lay with me
I'll teach you who to slay

I am teeth of fire
Taste a thousand shames
I am bleak desire
Known throughout the days

I am beast inside
Demon in my veins
I am speech denied
Thoughts enslaved and chained

Ooh Cult without a name
Ooh Cult without a name
Ooh Can you feel it
Ooh Cult without a name
