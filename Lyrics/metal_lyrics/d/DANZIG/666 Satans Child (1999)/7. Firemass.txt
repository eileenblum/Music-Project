Firemass

I've come to lie on the fire
Burn into my soul
A season soon to expire
Takes a welcome toll

I've come to lie on the fire
Come to cleanse the blood
I want to bring you all higher
Show me the thing you love

Will you ever
No, you may never
See me on the other side of this life
Will you ever
No, you may never

Firemass

I've come to lie on the fire
Flame against my tongue
Tell me the death you desire
Sure to make it so

Will you ever
No, you may never
See me on the other side of this life
Will you ever
No, you may never
See me on the other side of this life
Will you ever
No, you may never
See me on the other side of this life
Will you ever
No, you may never
