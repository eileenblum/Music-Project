Five fingers crawl
Around your neck
The more you live
The more they take
The more you breath
The more they want
Five fingers cross
Upon your face

You leave me cold
Couldn't pay the price
You leave me cold
Cold as the...

Some have to have
Some like to bleed
The more they take
The more you need

Some have to have
Some like to bleed
The more they take
The more you need

You leave me cold
You leave me cold

Five fingers crawl
Around the room
The more you want
It seals your doom
The more they take
Extends your pain
Five fingers crawl
And end the game

You leave me cold
Couldn't pay the price
You leave me cold
Cold as the...

Some have to have
Some like to bleed
The more they take
The more you need

Some have to have
Some like to bleed
The more they take
The more you need

You leave me cold
Couldn't pay the price
You leave me cold
Cold as the night

You leave me cold
You leave me cold
You leave me cold
You leave me cold
You leave me cold
You leave me cold
You leave me cold
