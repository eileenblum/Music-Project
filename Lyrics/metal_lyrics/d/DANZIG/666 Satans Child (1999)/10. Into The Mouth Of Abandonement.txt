Stoneface
Tears don't fall
Who gives a fuck?
Sometimes you wanna give your life away
But once you give it, you can never get it back intact

And no one knows
'Cause no one cares
And no one shows
'Cause no one dares
No one dares
No one dares
No one dares

Black angel
Falling feathers
Stare long into the mouth of abandonment
The trip down is a long one
It seems the harder you try to hold something in your arms
The quicker it dies

And no one knows
'Cause no one cares
And no one shows
'Cause no one dares
No one dares
No one dares
No one dares
