I can see you staring at me
But you're not there
I can hear your voice still calling
I miss you still
You are the saddest one
That lingers on
Yours are the grayest eyes
To bring me love

Poor little thing you do
Eternal and so cold
And you know this heart is cold
Eternal, always cold

I can feel you wandering
Among my thoughts
Many things still whisper to me
You're never gone
You were the saddest one
It lingers on
Yours were the grayest eyes
They bring me love

Poor little thing you do
Eternal and so cold
And you know this heart is cold
Eternal, always cold
