She's got the smile of the Lilin-child
Her spiral ink crawling down her spine
When she walks in her Isis stride
You see her hair, like the raven, shines, yeah

She's got the soul of the darkest star, yeah
I wanna touch all her glow imparts
And if you look down into her eyes, yeah
You'll see the souls she has trapped inside

Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes
Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes

She has the tongue of the goddess Shai
Split like an asp down the shaft entwined
Upon the wings of the nefil night, yeah
She who is sin casts the coldest light

Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes
Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes
Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes
Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes

No one knows her, Lilin-child (child)
I'm gonna bind you
No one knows her, Lilin-child (child)
I'm gonna bind you
No one knows her, Lilin-child (child)
I'm gonna bind you

She's got the soul of the darkest star, yeah
I wanna touch all her glow imparts
She's got the smile of the Lilin-child, yeah
Her spiral ink crawling down her spine

Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes
Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes
Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes
Ah-ah
Ah-ah Here she comes

No one knows her, Lilin-child (child)
I'm gonna bind you
No one knows her, Lilin-child (child)
I'm gonna bind you
No one knows her, Lilin-child (child)
I'm gonna bind you
