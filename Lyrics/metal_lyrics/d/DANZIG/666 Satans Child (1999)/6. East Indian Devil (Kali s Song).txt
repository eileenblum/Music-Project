Free, I'm alive, yeah
All that I am
Know that I've woken
All of my senses

Now I'm half-burning
Flames out my eyes
From my darkness
Close by my side, yeah

And lo' see my cold dance

From my darkness
Culled from my pride, yeah
Down in the blindness
Form latent hides

Dual is my aspect
Cool to the touch
Drink from my warm cup
Life is the blood, yeah

Now I'm alive, yeah
All things I am
In blood I have tasted
All that I am

In love and blood
In love and blood, yeah
