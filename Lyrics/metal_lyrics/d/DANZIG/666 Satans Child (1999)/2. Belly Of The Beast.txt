Did my time among the creeps
Did my time among the thieves
Did my time among the scores
Did my time among the whores
Did my time among the blessed
Walked among the living dead
Searching up and down this world
Doing things you've never heard

Down in the belly of the beast I lie
All I save is my...
Down in the belly of the beast I lie
All I save is my pain

Did my time among the lost
Paying such a heavy cost
Did my time among the cruel
Laying with the broken fools
Did my time among the slaves
Walked around their waiting graves
Did my time among the lies
Watching as they slowly die

Down in the belly of the beast I lie
All I save is my...
Down in the belly of the beast I lie
All I save is my...
Down in the belly of the beast I lie
All I save is my...
Down in the belly of the beast I lie
All I save is my pain

Did my time among the strong
Some are here and some are gone
Did my time among the cursed
Praying that my brain would burst
Did my time among the slaves
Walked upon their living graves
Did my time among the lies
Watching as they slowly die
