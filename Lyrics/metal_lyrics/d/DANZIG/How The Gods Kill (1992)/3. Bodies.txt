[Lyrics: Glenn Danzig]

[chorus:]
bodies
please
don't cry
bodies
don't die
bodies
please don't cry
bodies

I been taking all the silver
I been saving all the gold
I'm gonna stuff it down the throat
of a week old corpse
save that doggone soul
I been saving up my pain
I'm gonna give it back in spades
I been strangling the cries
from the murder of love
save your soul tonight

I been raising up the dead
gonna send them to the house of Cain
I been praying in light
of the warning moon
slay your doggone soul
I been put upon this world
I been walking up and down
to and fro
save your doggone soul

I got bodies on the left
I got bodies on the right
I got bodies
up and down
all across town
save your soul tonight
