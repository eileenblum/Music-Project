[Lyrics: Glenn Danzig]

devil on the left
angel on the right
there's no mistake
who'll I be w/ tonight
over the fore
lamb's head on my lap
days
pass like weeks w/o the sight

then comes the fury of the lullaby
then comes the fury of the lullaby

heartbeat in a hole
an eyeball
loose and wild
dropping memories
out upon the open tiles
and over to the left
there sit the loveless ones
crying slowly and sucking on a gun

do you wear the mark
do you wear the mark
darling
darling
do you wear the mark
