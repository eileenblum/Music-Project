[Lyrics: Glenn Danzig]

out
of the night comes
a timeless thing
calm
in simplicity
whispers
soft
a seductive voice
meant for the human ear
down
down
down
I'm gonna take you
down
that's when the dying calls

if I look
in the dark of this world
if I lose
I don't mind
that's when the dying calls

down
through the ages
from the dawn of time
roam
through the world of dreams
up
drom the black
of the Mississippi mud
calling
out to everything
down
down
down
I'm gonna bring you
down
that's when the dying calls

if I play
in the dark of this world
if I lose
I don't mind
that's when the dying calls

Thanks to flboatman for correcting track #6 lyrics.
