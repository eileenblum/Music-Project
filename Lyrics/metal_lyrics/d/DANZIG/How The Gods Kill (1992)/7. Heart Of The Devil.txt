[Lyrics: Glenn Danzig]

I am
heart
of the
devil

I have
heart
of the
devil

I can make a man
freeze in his tracks
I can make a man
fall to his death
I can make a girl
so eager to please
I can make a young girl
lay down
for me
because
I'm evil
and
love is gone

I can make the skies
thunder and shake
I can make the world
tremble and quake
I can make your pulse
pound in your veins
I can make your heart
stop
and start
again
because
I'm evil
love is gone

I can make the world
tremble and shake
I can make the skies
black in my wake
I can make a girl
so eager to please
I can make a young girl
lay down
for me
because
I'm evil
and
love is gone
my love is gone
