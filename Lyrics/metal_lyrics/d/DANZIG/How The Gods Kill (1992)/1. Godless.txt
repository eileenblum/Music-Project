[Lyrics: Glenn Danzig]

godless
feeling
in me
night
after
night
godless
feeling
in me
borne
of
their lives

you gave me all of this
and more
yea that's for sure
I can't believe in all your pain
under the draining of a
christian
deities blood
you tell your children
they're insane

I couldn't love it anymore
I had to listen to my heart
I couldn't take it anymore
and so you leave me
godless

just spread your
tentacles
of hate
around my life
I've taken more than you could ever give
you can't believe that  someone
challenges
your right
I'm gonna send you back your pain

I couldn't love it anymore
I had to listen to my heart
I couldn't take it anymore
and so you leave me
godless

I ask all who have gathered here to join me
in this feast may we always be strong in body
spirit
and mind
and all of those who would try to harm us
let them be cast aside
