[Lyrics: Glenn Danzig]

take my hand
you'll
never find
another
quite like mine
if you look
you'll
see that I'm
a lonely one

I
lost my soul
deep inside
and it's so
black
and cold
deep inside

sistine smile
you'll
never know
the trap it's set

and if you did
you'll
never look
into
its eyes

the sun don't shine
the wind won't blow
when you go hide
without your love
I'm lonely
deep inside
