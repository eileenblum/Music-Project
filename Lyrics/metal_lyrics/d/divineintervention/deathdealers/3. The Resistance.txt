We're fighting for metal we're screaming it out loud
We're doing what we love we're sending you the shout
We're making the disorder we're curing the disease
We're defying the progress as the musics getting older

Fight! Fight! Resistance of few
Burn! Burn! Everything what's new
Come! Come! Join the resistance
Die! Die! For good remembrance

Do you think it's senseless? do you think we're dead?
Do you think there is no brain in our fucking heads?
For all these stupid questions we're answering like that
The true, old metal it is all we fucking got
