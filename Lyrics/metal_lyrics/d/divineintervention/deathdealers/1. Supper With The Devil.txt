What is source of all evil in the world?
I hope that you will know when you are good
Don't want to be bad you get nothing at all
And the butchers go for the supper with the devil
And the butchers eat their own supper with the devil

Do not hesitate to do what you want
Death is the best point the strongest wins
The weakest fails the saints will always fall
And the butchers go for the supper with the devil
And the butchers eat their own supper with the devil
