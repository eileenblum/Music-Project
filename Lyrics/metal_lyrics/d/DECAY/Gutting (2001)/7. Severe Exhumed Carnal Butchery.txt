abhor the disfigured
mentally deformed epidemic
infectious rotten blood
spasmic larvae swarming in the rotting

fresh grave, wide open
orally excreting, nausea
regurgitate, vomiting gore
pouring, gushing red

venomous slime corrodes eyelids
eyeballs are dried up
fermenting, flesh sheding

corpse...
rotting...
rising...

maggots swarming feasting, meat rotten and purulent
devourment and digestion, in the stomach
flies take parts, swallow the pus
digesting, then regurgitating the rotting parts
