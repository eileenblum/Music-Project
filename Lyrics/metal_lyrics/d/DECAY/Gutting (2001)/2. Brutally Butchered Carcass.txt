my spear bathing in you blood, in your rectum
crushing spinal columns, impaling the lungs
the base of your neck cracks, your brains scatter
blood spewing, horrifying wound

deaden
grotesque impalement
vile offering on a stick
smashed, torn and mangled

molested and abused

decomposture
covered with purulent sores
bathing in pus
decayed flesh, rotting organs

bloodsoaked appeal, carnal infest
maggots consume, devour the insides

I will soon kill again, maybe it will be someone you love
