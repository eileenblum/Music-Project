surgery, pathological examination
gluttony on pro lapse, surgeon in psychosis
patient in dormant paralysis, munching and mincing
gastric meat, repugnant devourment
cannibal atrosity, necropsy

stenching reek
deeds sick, morbid
genitals sliced
frenzing scalpel carnage
blurred in oxidase

inserting steel into virginal tissues
raped of all cosmetics
ripping, tearing, defleshing, gutting
carnage

post psychotic nausea
puking out the ingested
forensic pathology vomit decorated
exhaling with burst

gasping breath
inhaling rancid regurgitate
traumatized
extreme pulmonary fibrosis
