My lust's released in powerful streams
I'm beneath your feet

High-heel boots and grooving butts
Is just your beat

Extra dry and will tempered
Perfume so thick, I drink it deep inside
Warmer than kisses from the sun above

Thigh-high boots - sleazy vibes
And I taste - all her love
A pound of flesh - to sleep again
Once again - and I always will

Deep within that wicked dreams
My lust's released in powerful streams
The urge of getting total wants
Perverse to some but now and used
Sweet pleasure of this nasty abuse
