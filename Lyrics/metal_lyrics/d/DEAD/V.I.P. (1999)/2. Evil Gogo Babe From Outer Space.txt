Come on baby, sweet sugar honey
Come on girl and trust in me
You bring me down, over and out
You are falling - falling to the ground

Four lips working well on me
Desired flesh wrapped around my skin
Like a belching volcano
She's riding toward the realm of passion

Greedy screams of lust
She's a gogo teaser - a demon queen
Our flesh reduced to one
And I am overloaded

Evil Gogo Babe From Outer Space
