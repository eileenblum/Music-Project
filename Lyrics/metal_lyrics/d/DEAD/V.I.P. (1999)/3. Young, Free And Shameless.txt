Take a trip into "dead" and feel
You're getting high
Look at my 10 inch ripper and get
Your demons ride

Yeah, you're young
Yeah, free and shameless
Yeah, I can't deny you
Yeah, my gasoline

I can give my morningstar
So please call me "god"
Hands and knees on the floor,
I fly high when you're down
Yeah, young, free and shameless
Forget virginity
Requite the tight thighs
My speciality

The loss of innocence lies in their hands
It's the will of nature
To be young, free and shameless
Yeah,
High expectations
Boundless curiosity
Enjoy the news
Of your own unexplored flesh

Feel the vibes on your skin
Total vixen love machine
The girl is fused and loaded now
Yeah baby, move your ass
Yeah,
