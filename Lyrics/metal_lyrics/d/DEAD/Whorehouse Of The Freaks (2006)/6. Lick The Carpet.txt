here's the sweetest temptation
the ultimate crown of creation
the missing link between your legs
we're back  now pray and beg

grown older, but "free and shameless"
- the good old farts
kneel down &amp; praise the church
of your (obviously) preferred triangle

the dark evil chapel
between your thighs
a tempting sweet smell
my preffered hell
my tongue navigates
through the mountains of flesh
revel in juice - revel in slime!

lost in delight
totally exhausted
no cure in sight
lick the carpet!

the missing link
between your legs
don't let it shrink
just gimme some head!

lost in delight...
the dark evil chapel...
lost in delight...
