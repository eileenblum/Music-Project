Short but slim
Don't call "Big Jim"
It ain't that long, but it's quite thin
The smallest piece is for the win
This little shrimp shall be your king

The shortest straw is pulled by you
You gotta realize: it's true!

On my thin stick you gotta bounce
It's not the size that really counts

There's no girl tha cannot
deep-throat me
Suck it dry, this narrow shorty

My needle pierces your hole
pleases your heart, delights your soul
Open up for my toothpick!
I promise it's no too thick.
The smallest piece is for the win
This little shrimp shall be your king - yeah!
