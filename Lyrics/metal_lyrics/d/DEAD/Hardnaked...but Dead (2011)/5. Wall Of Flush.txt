Just one final shot
Tumbling home
Shit my pants
Again, I'll sleep alone

My feet are too big
Brain's too small
Bleed my nose
On that damned fuckin' wall

Too many keyholes for my single key
No chance to escape the wrath of "she"
Blow on the head
Honk from my pants
Tonight there'll be again no "romance"
No way to hide my messy clothes
...and obviously my bleeding nose
The beast's unleashed
Hell from above
I run into the wall of flush

Bound by vice but hard-naked
There's just one thing in my brain
Oh-oh, I can't hardly wait
To feel the wall of flush again!

Just one final shot
Tumbling home
Shit my pants
Again, I'll sleep alone
