Craving power for knell.
Wait for sunrise; with respiratory.
Pronounce the season.
Lactated suffering shines the face of lie.
Denouncing my crown, I bow to you.
Sealed my fate, inoculation.
Stoned to death; peace is lie.
Lactated suffering shines the face of lie.
Ruptured from the heart of man, heart of living.
Bludgeon, I turn the table, bow down to me.
Consuming fate in the fear of no home.
Denouncing my crown, I bow to you.
Sealed my fate, inoculation.
Peace is a lie, fallow no one.
