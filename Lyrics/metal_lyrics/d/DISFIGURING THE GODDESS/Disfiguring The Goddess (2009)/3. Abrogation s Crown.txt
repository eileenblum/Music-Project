You're affliction is bemoaning
To drain myself of life.

Wretchedness posses repulsion
To defect my crawl.

Abruptness resurrects from
Your sleep as my gore
Peels away the neck.

Denouncing the title of
Suicide for my name.
Bereavement, I'll kill myself.

Carving my name into you're chest
As I past through you onto
My everlasting walk into nothing.
Squinting eyes bleed for nothing.

Fallowing the weak.
Praying for this one.

Perforated light;
Only room for darkness.
Drained from the neck.
