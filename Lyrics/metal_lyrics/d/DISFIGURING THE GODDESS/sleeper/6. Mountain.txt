Forsworn and forgotten, a totem of power rises from the earth.
A supernatural light staggers out from behind the shadow of what once was alive and breathing.
A figure, made up of teeth, is brought back to life on top of the totem.
His mouth opens showing nothing but blackness and sorrow.
The eyes of the summoners widen with terror, as their request has not been granted.
Regret.
The forsworn lifts his finger, pointing to the mountain.
