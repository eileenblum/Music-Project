The hero, ironicly unarmed, bound by fate, is transformed
into particles as the beats defeats the last true hope for
the human race. A bareathment of nature, plant like cell
process in planet form. A new vision of power arises from
the vines of ash left over form the stroggos wars. Legions
of the unrested leave their passion for grief and dismay.
The future of the great eye is now inside it's own mouth.
