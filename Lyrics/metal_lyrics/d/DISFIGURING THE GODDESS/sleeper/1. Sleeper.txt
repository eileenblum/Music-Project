Submerged in the ocean that was once reserved for the vast number of serpents that now walk among us.
My body engulfs with fear, my mind controls the ribbons of color.
Trapped int a shear, my lungs pump fluently.
Path finding the stars to separate reality from the imaginary, the sleeper has awakened. Bellowing from the bulk of the earth, the sleeper has awakened. Lamentations trace new lines.
Listen: To the fall of man. To the rise of power. To the fall of man.
To the rise of power
