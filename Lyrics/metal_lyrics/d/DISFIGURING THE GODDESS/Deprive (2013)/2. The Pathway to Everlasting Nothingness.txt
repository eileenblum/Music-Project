Sand and night for as long as physically present. A creator clearly puts a pawn into his tomb. Hold your fate for me. Recontract a swarming crown of improvection, Sand and night connect with the points of nine. Is the nature of evil rooted or is it a choice. The pawn without awareness ventures into a endless valley of foolish curiosity without being human.
