A serpent light. The color is beautiful but the nature is deadly. The sky fills with an hue of apocalypse. Fear is surpassed by submission to death. The final rider. The grips of the beast fly through the air. Iverserating everything in sight. All that was loved. All that was earned. Stripped and erased.
