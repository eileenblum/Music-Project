Admiration of anger. The prebirth, no remorse the sight of hate for the lack of fear. It must be our will. Bounding, sail for me, down to a world below. Clawing at the sun maybe understood. 
Super within. We're coming for you. It sets it, it releases ourselves. Tomorrow, filled with deprivatization. Awake the full animal unleash the devotion of our kin breathed to be. Drums they fill the air. Ripped apart. The beast tears the earth in half, after all. Four feet of ribbon. Rises from the mountain here I am, suffering. Clawing at the sun, coming for you.
