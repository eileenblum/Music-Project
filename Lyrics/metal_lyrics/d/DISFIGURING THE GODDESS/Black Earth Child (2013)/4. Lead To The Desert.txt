Split down the middle flesh and bone spare nothing as the land of desert takes a toll. Meek and nimble, shadow fills the spaces. She listens to the spider. Consuming the fifth leg. Blinded by spear. Stop interrupted. By the wrath of man. Bearing life like light. Vines and trees silent and strong. In the wordless chamber, communication deprivation. Recognize the disposal, unleash life everlasting. Meek and nimble, shadows fill the spaces. She listens to the spider.
