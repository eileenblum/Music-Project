Blood shed. Bleed out child, for him, of diseases untitled. For him, colossal and frigutail. The tyrant from the great sea comet. Breath through me, hell to serve her. Break away from death's last breath. Silence, blackness, color fields. Archers from the north sound their horns. Razor tomb. Corruption and chaos sets up a fortress within the abandoned mountain. Uses her from the depths to serve her. Bleed out child, bleed.
