Eye of peril glare through me with hospitality. Cradle me with toxin, warm my body with agony. Crawling down the glass panels of the suffer square. Legs of the armies glorify the seismic aspects of the earth. The giant's eyes open simultaneously, they wake only once. I was told to light the beacon. Floating and disfigured, my hands blacken. The mother carries the child to the mouth.
