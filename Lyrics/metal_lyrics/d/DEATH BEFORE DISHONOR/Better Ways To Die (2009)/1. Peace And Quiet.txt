All the talking and nothing is solved
All the pressure - it's killing us all
All the stress in a fantasyland
It's a nightmare I can't understand

Can I get a little peace and quiet
Just a little fucking peace and quiet

There's an assault on my brain
Wave of white noise - deafening pain
Are my ears bleeding again
I can't breathe - my head's caving in

Can I get a little peace and quiet
Just a little fucking peace and quiet please
Stop right now!

Every day... the same fucking thing
Your shit attitude makes my ears ring
See my happiness slipping away
I can't stand another day

I'm choking on the air you drained
the hope away and filled it with shit
