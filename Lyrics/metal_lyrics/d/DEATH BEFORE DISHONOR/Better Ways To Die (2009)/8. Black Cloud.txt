I walked away... another wake... another loss we can't take
And when disease... comes again... all my strength can't... defend
It takes its toll and I feel beat... that black cloud it loves me
I try to run I cover up... in the end we just get fucked

Coming down, just like rain
And that black cloud won't go away
Emptiness... sickening
Just one more day to test my faith

And I saw in her eyes... all the pain of endless lives
God I wish... I could heal all the suffering... that you take
All the air... goes so thin... crashing down lost in
In a nightmare... we all share... but the worst I can't bear

Loss comes with life I can't deny

When the loss hits
Like a freight train
And the black cloud rains down on me pouring agony

And every second, every day
I'll take the suffering in the rain
And all the while I know someday
That black cloud will fade, and let the sun shine on me
