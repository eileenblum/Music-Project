They locked my brother up today
Not justified, no reasoning
They'll hate on us for how we live
Their jealousy, we can't forgive
So how am I supposed to be
When it's illegal to be free

I got my visions, I got my ways
I've grown stronger through the days
So when it's time to defend what's mine
Come out on top every time
The boys and blue they got no control
Out harassing people they don't know
You're just a sheep, no heart or mind
Free men always win... in time

They pulled me over yesterday
They grabbed my crotch and took my pay
So what am I supposed to do
But disrespect those boys in blue
I don't need a badge to hide behind
I got my heart, my soul, and my mind
I'll win every time

I can't forgive the deeds,
You take men's will to breathe,
can't set my friends free
But I still live my live free,
They still can't control me,
can't take what I've seen,
can't change the life I lead

You can't change a thing about me
You can't take my heart away from me
