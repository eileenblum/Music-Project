Remember the bite in the air
Remember the smell of the fear
The feeling that's stuck deep inside
Shaping how I live my life
The standards I held to be gold
It seems that I've grown to be old
The values that I'll always hold
Seem to be forgotten by

This world that I
enter with my head held high
I've stayed this way
There's no excuse for you to stray

You'll fade away - Ya, you'll fade away
They all fade away

Now, remember the nights, remember the fights,
that way that I live my life
Remember the streets that we paved in blood
Remember I stand by the ones I love

We stand - as one - this can't be undone -
We'll rise - to fight a testament to this life

Fade - Away
