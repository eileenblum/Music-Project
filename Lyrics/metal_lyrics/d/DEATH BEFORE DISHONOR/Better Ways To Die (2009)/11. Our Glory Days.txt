Thinking back to younger days when we were young and free
Ditching out on work to catch the show along the T
Cueballs in our pockets and our hearts were on our sleeves
Watching all the older kids get wild along the stage
Fighting all the bouncers till we put them in their place
Heading out to nowhereville just to fucking play

Spending my days, Living my way
Some say its dead, But I can't forget

Knowing every day could be another stupid fight
Struggling and clawing at the fabric of my life
Cops around the corner want to take away my rights
They could never understand the way it used to be
And they could never know how much it's still that way to me
Cause I'm a fucking lifer and know I'll always be right here,
Right here

Spending my days, Living my way
Some say it's dead, But I can't forget
Deep in my heart right from the start
Old to the new making it through

Looking back on my glory days
Torn up knuckles, bruised up face

I found my home in this violent place
Forge an iron will in hate

Looking back on my glory days
Look ahead see they're here to stay
Live a dream - takes it all the way
And be grateful every day

Never dwell on the harder days
Learn my lessons from mistakes
Every day's a glory day when you
Stand by the values and refused to fade away

I can't be stopped
We can't be dropped
I'm just too strong
I see it so clear and I know we can't be wrong!
