So far from home
I threw away the regular ways
Let the open road take me away
In the van most of the day,
Working hard just to get up and play
Through the sickness, endure the pain,
miss my home but I'm loving these days
No security nothing to pay, just fill the van up with gas,
And let the open road take me away

What's better... safety or truth
The grass ain't greener when were letting it loose
I get sick of the hardships around
But let the wheels hit the ground
Take me down to play another town

Homesick when I'm so far away
Can't count the hours and I can't count the days
I've lost so many things in so many ways
But what I think really counts,
It shines brighter each and every day

It's plain to see... we're just scraping by
Wait everyday, cover the miles
Hit the town so far from my home
But 30 minutes a night I'm flying high on this life I know

Sleep on the floor, or whatever it takes
This shit's for love there's no money to make
Our fucking payoff shines brighter than gold
We take the lessons we know and all come in from the fucking cold

I give my all for the dreams, we always dreamed, living it free
I give my life to the road, out in the cold, worth more than gold
