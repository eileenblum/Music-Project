I - I've been - so drained - a hollow shell - numb to pain and
I - I will - make it through - come out stronger - I always do
One more funeral might just make me break
How much suffering are we meant to take
Feel the world cave in and start to break

I - I can't - come clean - living in - an empty dream and
I - I dropped - the fucking deal - left the future - we had sealed
Back at zero - happy, broke, and free but
Fuck this year it's took too much from me
Feel the world cave in and start to break
From me

Forged an iron will - kept a cool head
All my family cries - for our gone and dead
We've lost too much
too many friends and family gone
Disease and addiction
Never thought I'd have to be so strong
We're only 3 months in and I see no dawn

No dawn
The sun fell - on us all - when the new year - heeded its call
Darkness - with our loved ones gone - will it come around
When will we see the dawn
I pray it won't be long
