They'll find you dead on the side of the street
When the sun comes up on old colony
Another junkie snitch brought to his knees
By the hard world he never had to will to beat

Your hard times mean nothing to me
You're a prisoner, beaten and weak
Hard men grow harder from pain
But you just caved in, crumbled and shamed

My hate, can't wait, to seal your fate

You'll never learn like so many I seen
You just spend your days alone, hiding from me
I know the games and I know your kind
And when I came to you, you locked the door and cried

Your feelings mean nothing to me
The embodiment of filth and disease
Rats love the sewers but they come up to eat
And I'll be waiting to catch you on that city street

My hate, can't wait, to seal your fate

You stick your coffin nail into your veins
And tell the world they just can't feel your pain
You'll spend your final days living in vain
You're just a broken boy living in shame
So stick it in

And death's the only thing that can save you from me
And death's the only thing that can save you from my hate
