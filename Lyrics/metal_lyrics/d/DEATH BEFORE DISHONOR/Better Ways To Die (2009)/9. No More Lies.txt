Fuck all of your ways of submission
Fuck your hopes and your dreams and your visions
I will fight till I die till the tears flow from my mothers eyes
Fuck all, your insurance and laws
Blood will flow for the noblest cause
Force your fear on the youth break their spirit and bury the truth

This is it, I'm tired of all your shit
No more lies nothing left to hide
So fucking sick of everything you stand for

Fuck you, I can see in your soul
You don't have it you just play the role
Here it is, on the streets
Here I am you won't forget me
Fuck you, see you acting so hard
Act away but I'm pulling your card
Play your games it's no use
I will forge on and fight to break loose

This is it, I'm tired of all your shit
No more lies nothing left to hide
So fucking sick of everything you stand for

Just take a good look at yourself look at yourself
Can't you see it's all coming down coming down
Pay the price for the things you do
Now no one cares for you
