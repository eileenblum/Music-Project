I'll lay you down
Broken just what you asked for and more
Choking... gasping and gagging...
I can't... stop myself can't... help myself
It's like a tidal wave taking me over and out

Out of my mind
Whiled my teeth just grind
I can hear you cry
Such a sweet release
Bringing you to peace

Please take all that you said
Keep it inside... right in your head
No one will know... no one will hear
Breaking you down... no need to fear not now

I want to know how does it feel inside
Bound, beat, through the night
I want to hear the sound of what you feel
When it's for real

I want to feel it all

I swear I can smell the blood from here
Fell the sweat drip down and mix with tears
It's like a chemical in my brain
Forcing me to act insane
When the flesh is in my clutch
It's done, they're all fucked
