They breed the kids
to value what they say
fuel a desire
for a different day
a fire burning up the truth inside
(canÂ´t consume me)
a hollow man living an empty life
(that wonÂ´t be me)
no not me I wonÂ´t be weak
rip apart the thickest skin
IÂ´ll stand until the end
IÂ´ll fall, IÂ´ll rise â hold on until I die
I see beyond the simple plan
IÂ´ll rise and be a better man
thereÂ´s no retreat â I canÂ´t be beat
reject the lies
You can talk but I will not buy
sever the lies
I always knew
the things they promised me
would just be used
to keep me on a leash
they numb your mind
until they sell your soul
no not me I wonÂ´t be weak
rip apart the thickest skin
IÂ´ll stand until the end
IÂ´ll fall, IÂ´ll rise â hold on until I die
I see beyond the simple plan
IÂ´ll rise and be a better man
thereÂ´s no retreat â I canÂ´t be beat
transparent world â IÂ´ve seen it fall
into the cracks â crumble the walls
and now I canÂ´t be
CANÂ´T BE BEAT
