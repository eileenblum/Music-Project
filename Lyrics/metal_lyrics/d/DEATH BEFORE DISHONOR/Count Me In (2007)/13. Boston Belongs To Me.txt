[covered from Cock Sparrer - England Belongs To Me]

Years of being told you ain't as good as us
Join the line, sign your name
And they all said that our country's going bust
But no-one's fooling us again

Boston belongs to me
A nation's pride the dirty water on the rivers
No one can take away our memory
Oh Oh, Boston belongs to me

We'll show the world that the boys are back to stay
And they all know what we can do
Heads held high, fighting all the way
For the red, white, and blue
