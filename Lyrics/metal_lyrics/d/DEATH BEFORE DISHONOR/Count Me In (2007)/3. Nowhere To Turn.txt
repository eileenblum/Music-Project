And with the best of times
just comes more miserable days
let is decay my mind
leave me in a cloudy haze
I canÂ´t seem to fill this void in me
so IÂ´ll just keep avoiding reality
I canÂ´t seem to fill this void in me
so IÂ´ll just drown in misery
I think but donÂ´t fear
I act but donÂ´t care
I think but donÂ´t know
I act but not for show
sometimes I just canÂ´t stand
to see or hear
spiral downward
always end up nowhere
IÂ´ve let my mind decay
I wonÂ´t see the glory days
IÂ´ll fall too soon
I know you feel it too
