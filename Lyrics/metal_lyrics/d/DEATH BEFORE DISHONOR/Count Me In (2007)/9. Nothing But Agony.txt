I canÂ´t take this much longer
the emptiness is killing me
nothing lies, ahead for me
nothing but agony
a piece of shit I sit and rot
there is no way to stop these thoughts
and I know I cannot undo
the damage IÂ´ve done
whereÂ´s the love
I once had inside?
whereÂ´s the strength?
I said would never die?
emptiness I canÂ´t seem to fill
but the hate grows every day
until the day that I die
until I die
Broken down inside
