Just because you canÂ´t big it out
find it in yourself
the rage that drives us all
not to fall in line melt away your face
bleed into the days
just another follower waiting to die
BEHIND YOUR EYES
I can see thereÂ´s something
BEHIND YOUR EYES
you used to stand so strong
BEHIND YOUR EYES
I can see you think you count
BEHIND YOUR EYES
you were never part of this
just because you were once around
acting in the crowd
doesnÂ´t mean a thing â not to me
now you say know your history
sell it on t.v.
make a buck who gives a fuck
but itÂ´s not dead to me
BEHIND YOUR EYES
I can see thereÂ´s something
BEHIND YOUR EYES
you used to stand so strong
BEHIND YOUR EYES
I can see you think you count
BEHIND YOUR EYES
you were never part of this
forget a new day
shut your fucking mouth
see your way out
you never knew what this is about
