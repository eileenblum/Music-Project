The worlds turned over
and IÂ´m waiting to fall
a day without rain
is day I canÂ´t recall
my sanity uproots
and I try to stay strong
but when lightning strikes
it all goes wrong
stop and think and remember why
if we were meant to love
then I will never love again
I canÂ´t erase all the things that I regret
I canÂ´t go back in time
and take back all the shit that I said
I canÂ´t erase all the things that I regret
I canÂ´t go back in time and take
back all the shit IÂ´ve said
I have grown so empty inside
IÂ´ve got to rise
I wonÂ´t curl up and die
I feel the weight itÂ´s crushing my back
my legs are weak and I canÂ´t turn back
the pain brings hate inside
it makes me strong
and I wonÂ´t curl up and die
