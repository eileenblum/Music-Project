Infected world upon itÂ´s own pedestal
diseased â we are diseased
weÂ´ve always been
weÂ´re just the joke
the joke of existence
but still we try as if there was an end
through blood we made
as if we were perfect
someday the blood
will choke us in our sleep
IÂ´ve given in to all of my demons
I canÂ´t be helped â itÂ´s up to me
every time I close my eyes
IÂ´m dwelling on the follow times
my regrets wonÂ´t let me rest
ItÂ´s killing me with every step
every step I regret
INFECTED â were condemned to die
INFECTED â cut always this life
