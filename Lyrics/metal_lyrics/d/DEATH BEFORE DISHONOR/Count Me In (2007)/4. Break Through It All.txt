Time took its toll â left me cold
and drove me down to hopelessness
through suffering gamed my strength
just to see itÂ´s limits
should I quit
let defeat have itÂ´s way with my soul
or should I crash into those walls
that seems so unbreakable
why die a beaten man?
too weak to take a stand
in the end itÂ´s all a dream
so why not take the suffering
I know thereÂ´s something there
canÂ´t see but I can almost hear
IÂ´d rather lose again
than ever know what couldÂ´ve been
I may not see past myself
but I know thereÂ´s something else
IÂ´m done searching for excuses in life
IÂ´m done losing to a made up enemy
IÂ´m done searching for excuses in life
no more losing â not this time
I may not see past myself
but I know thereÂ´s something else
drive my head into that wall
kill the dream
BREAK THROUGH IT ALL
