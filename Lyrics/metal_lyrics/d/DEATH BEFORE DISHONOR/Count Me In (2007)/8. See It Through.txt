Their dreams of richer days
never stood in my way
see through the empty words
(IÂ´ve been here)
spitting up force fed fear
choking on my own tears
not I canÂ´t even care
(IÂ´m numb for the world)
you took an honest man
threatened to take all that you can
and now the blood will stain my hands
donÂ´t value what you take
intimidation goes to waste
and now youÂ´ll get your ficking taste
you will taste the pain
flowing through my veins
IÂ´ve just began
to rip apart your everything
you will taste the pain
flowing through my veins
IÂ´ve just began
to rip apart your everything
your promises don't mean shit
words of a hypocrite
drowning in your own lies
(watch you die)
life fading from your eyes
my tears are turning to smiles
when misery swallows you whole
(you will know)
intimidation goes to waste
I donÂ´t value what you take
through the years IÂ´ve come to learn
the way it goes when the tables turn
abuse your power and feel the burn
IÂ´m gonna see it through
I live my life in a devils stare
endured the pain for so many years youÂ´ll pay in blood for all the tears
IÂ´m gone see it through
