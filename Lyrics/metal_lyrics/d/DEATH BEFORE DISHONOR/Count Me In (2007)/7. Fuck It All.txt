IÂ´ve been thinking it over
IÂ´ve been thinking long and hard
like a knife thatÂ´s been scraping
scraping away at my mind
FUCK IT ALL
IÂ´m sick of finding excuses
IÂ´m sick of feeling so down and out
a brick wall at a dead end
IÂ´m still trying to smash my way out
FUCK IT ALL
IÂ´m still trying to smash my way out
trying to see past something
thatÂ´s not there
but I will fall again
I canÂ´t see clear
levelled everything
that I thought was in my way
at the end of the dap
ItÂ´s just me here standing in my way
IÂ´ve been thinking it over
what the fuck is this all about
IÂ´m sick of finding excuses
IÂ´m sick of feeling so down and out
