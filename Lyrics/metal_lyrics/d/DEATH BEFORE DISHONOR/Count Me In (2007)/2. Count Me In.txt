I lost my grip on it all
all the pain is unresolved
all the words that meant so much
stolen â abused â raped â and fucked
same old story, theyÂ´ll suck it dry
leave me with nothing
leave me to die
taken for granted and lost in the mix
misrepresented
forsaken and dismissed
but count me in
I came to fight â I came to win
I came prepared for anything
more than the rest will ever know
IÂ´ll take this as far as it has to go
I shed my blood on the streets
left behind a piece of me
always coming up with more
unleashed the hatred strip to the core
I canÂ´t forget, I canÂ´t pretend
every turn is a dead end
running in circles for all of my life
dead to the system
choaking on all the lies
but I canÂ´t die
IÂ´m in a world of shit
where IÂ´ll never fit
IÂ´ll fight to win
in a life so cold
every way IÂ´m pulled
IÂ´ll stay the same inside
in a day so long
whether right or wrong
IÂ´m here until the end
COUNT ME IN
more than the rest will ever know
IÂ´ll take this as far as it has to go
COUNT ME IN
IÂ´m here until the end
