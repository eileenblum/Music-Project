IÂ´ve toppled over
and IÂ´m tumbling down
IÂ´ve hit the floor so hard
I broke the ground
my hands are shaking
and my heads a mess
I canÂ´t stop
the pounding in my chest
reaching, bleeding, helpless
needing something to save me â kill me
take me away
is there a light at the end
or is it just more pain?
it seems so far away
is every step in vain?
reaching, bleeding, helpless
needing, something to save me â kill me
TAKE ME AWAY
I always said I wanted more
I guess you get what you ask for
(get it)
