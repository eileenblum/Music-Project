Pray - for death
I can't stop longing for a release
From this game of endless suffering
Still I keep taking more of the pleasures
That sustain illusion
Drink my life away because I can't free
Myself from the same day
Just to have a taste of what I could have
If I just fucking died
Die in the arms - of the truth
Maybe someday - I'll have the strength
To just let go
Close my eyes - slip away
Sleep forever - escape the hate
No - I can't escape the hate
No escape I've fallen in love
With feeling pain
And nothing I can do can stop the hate
A bitter man I stand to escape my fate
