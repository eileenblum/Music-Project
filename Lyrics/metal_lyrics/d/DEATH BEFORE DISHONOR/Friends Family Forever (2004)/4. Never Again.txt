Looking back to the day it went down
I felt it coming there was no doubt
Built up it's just too much of the bullshit
I just can't add up
I know your mind games and
I can feel the strain but it wont phase me
Because I've seen it all and felt it all
I realize there's no such thing as hope
You made me make a choice
That I had to make
Now I know you're not true
It's time not to care so fuck you
I'll never know the truth so fuck you
You - you're the one - you're to blame
Never trust again I'm scarred for life
Believe the untold future
You never know what lies ahead
Tell me all the shit that you feel
Light a flame to it your shit ain't real
I will never love again
Burned by your greed
I see right through your tactics
I will never love again
Never trust in you again
Looking back to the day it went down
I felt it coming there was no doubt
Built up it's just too much of the bullshit
I just can't add up
I know your mind games and
I can feel the strain but it wont phase me
Because I've seen it all and I felt it all
I realize there's no such thing as hope
