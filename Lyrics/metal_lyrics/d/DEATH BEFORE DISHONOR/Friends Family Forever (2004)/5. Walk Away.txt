You're so quick
To manipulate you seemed so sincere
But you turned out so fake
You're so quick
To judge who you meet throwing
Around insults like you can't be beat
I'm so sick
Of all your shit breaking your word
Every chance that you get
I'm so sick
Of hearing your voice time to move on
Because you're not
Who you claim to be
Can't you understand your word
Isn't shit to me everything that I heard
Time to walk away can not
Get the best of me you're not
Who you claim to be
I look into your eyes into a world of lies
You preach so much but don't live it
I look into your eyes into a world of lies
You're fucked - you're fucked - you're fucked
I can see what you do
I can see right through you
I can see the things you say
They're bullshit to me
Who you claim to be can't you understand
Your word
Isn't shit to me everything that I heard
Time to walk away can not
Get the best of me your no
Who you claim to be
Walk away
No more I'm sick of this shit
Walk away I'm through with this
