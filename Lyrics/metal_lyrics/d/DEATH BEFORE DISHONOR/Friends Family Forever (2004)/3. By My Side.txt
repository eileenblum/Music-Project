Dig myself into this hole everyday
No ones around to take the blame
I can't accept the fact I've been lead astray
Just numb myself, numb myself every day
Life holding me down
Without a chance for me
Snake eyes on every roll
No control for myself
So this is it I can't live this life
Folding on the draw I owe it to strife
So this is it watch my demise
No other choice withholding all the cries
I accept this punishment my so called life
I have suffered laughing at my cries
You are my only savor
My only piece of mind
Nothing to be wasted I need you at my side
Drown myself inside this bottle again
Nothing inside to make it end
I'm so disgusted by the things that I see
My mind is tired somebody put me to sleep
I can't stop living this way
Failure runs deep in my veins
Is this my only escape
My only way to ease the pain
Life holding me down
Without a chance for me
Snake eyes on every roll
No control for myself
So this is it I can't live this life
Folding on the draw I owe it to strife
So this is it I watch my demise
No other choice withholding all the cries
I accept this punishment my so called life
I have suffered laughing at my cries
You are my only savior
My only piece of mind
Nothing to be wasted I need you at my side
In this world I'm so alone hurt
And heartache is all I know
