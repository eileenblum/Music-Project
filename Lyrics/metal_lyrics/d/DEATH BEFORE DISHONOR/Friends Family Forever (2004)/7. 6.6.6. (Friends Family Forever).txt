How can you live afraid to face the day?
This world will find a way to fuck you anyway
How can you live afraid to fucking fight?
I'd rather die that be a coward all my life
How can you live with fear inside your heart?
It eats away at you you'll lose the game
Before you start
How can you live with that feeling deep inside?
The sufferings everywhere
There is nowhere to hide
I'll fight for my brothers
I'll die for my family
Don't preach about peace
Cause it just seems like fear to me
I'll fight for my brothers
I'll die for my family
And you must admit
You're just fucking weak
Won't live in fear of the world
There's no excuse stand up and fight
My friends my family would die for me
