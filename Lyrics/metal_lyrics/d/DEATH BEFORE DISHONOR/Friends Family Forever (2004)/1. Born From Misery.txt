I can't take this anymore
I'm losing what I was
All the nightmares that I face
They draw away my love
I've become unreasonable...
A vehicle of pain
All the sadness turns to rage 'til
Everything's bloodstained
I will not be the victim
I will not play your games
It makes me sick to my stomach
I'll turn it around and you will fear my
Fucking face
And every morning I wake
I'm overcome with hate
There's nothing left inside
They say that nothing is for free
I've paid my dues in life
This fucking world belongs to me
I am your nightmare
Because I just don't fucking care
There's nothing you can do to me
I'm born from misery
