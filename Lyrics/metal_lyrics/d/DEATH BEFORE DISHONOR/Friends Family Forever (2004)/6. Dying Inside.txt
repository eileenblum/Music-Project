I'm out of answers I can't explain this shit
What did I do to deserve this mess
Turmoil finds a way to plague my days
There's no way out of this fucked up place
I look ahead - maybe I'm just blind
Looking back - it fucks up my mind
My dreams are shattered
No words can describe
The way I feel The thoughts I hide
I went to far too far this time
Why can't I find
What is my fate I pay no mind
It's a fucking lie nothing but a lie
Can't see beyond - beyond my eyes
This is too much I'm dying inside
