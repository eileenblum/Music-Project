Incessant bleeding, brutal afflictions
Crimson crown, poisoned oppressions
Disfigured body, contemplates death
Love the reason, every breath

The candle burns, the end nears
As thirst for life disappears

Sardonic anthem, harmony of scorn
The crucifixion, cord of death torn
Salvation unseen by naive minds
Separation, the darkness binds

For mankind his last breath
If but for one, suffering death
