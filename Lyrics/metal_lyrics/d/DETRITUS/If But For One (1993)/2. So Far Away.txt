Why, when I'm feeling down do you seem so far away?
Surrounded by love but alone inside my head
Why, when things go wrong do I run away and hide?
Life goes on, but I've been left behind

Oh, reach out and touch me
Show me that you're there, show me hat you care
I knew it wouldn't be easy,
But I'd never be alone, you would always guide me home
Then why do I feel so alone?

Why do I do the things I hate to do? The things I know I want to do
I cannot do even for you, I know you want me to
It's not me but that within me, that has taken control of me
When will be the day you take this wretched man and set him free?

I know you see
'Tis I that turn away from thee
You're here for me
But there's a door I hold the key

Selfish despair, the thing that binds me, hurting all of those around me,
Hurting you, the one who saved me, stops your light from shining from me,
Give me back the fire that burned in me, and help me be how I want to be,
And help me hate the enemy, he got too close to me

Don't follow me, follow the one I follow
Don't look to me, look to the one I look to
Don't turn away, because of the believers
The true one is the Christ, and not the Christians.
