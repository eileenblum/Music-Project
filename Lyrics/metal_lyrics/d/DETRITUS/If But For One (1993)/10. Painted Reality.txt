Cool to be high in the sky flying
Smashed on the pavement, you're bleeding and dying
The press have their story the dealers their money
Parents and friends are crying, it's too late for words
It's too late for words...

Evil desires twisted path bloody glory
Breaking his heart tear reddened eyes He does see us through
The father sighs his love is denied his love defied
For Him it is won share in the victory
A trip so wild and near
A trip of love for us all to share

For I have been there among the flower walls
Among the voices of liars and the Devil's calls
Creeping down the tunnel of doom where Hell awaited
Led into a darkness a prison I have created
Craving for my life to be a tortured eternity
Defying my calls on my last grains of sanity

Yes I have been there but I am still here
A vision of beauty pierced through my torture
Not even a call but a question was answered
A living dream a painted reality
My father has saved me from unbearable loss
The trip I'm now on secured by the cross.
