Silently, I wait the tears to fall
Forlorn entity, none to all
Vale of anguish, fragrant solitude
Bathed in sadness, sorrows interlude.

There is no black, no white, no grey
There is no light, no dark, no dusk
Only subtle shades of pastels.

A distant choir, a subtle melody
Fading perfume, haunting memory
Like stars fell in the snow
Eternal fires no longer glow.

There is no black...

Only subtle shades of pastels.

Silently, I wait the tears to fall.
