The love in those eyes I see
The trusting nature they call naivete
A peace with all to me so unattainable

So far advanced to the world that surrounds them
So much to teach the fools who mock them

Looked upon as subhumanity
Just for pity and charity
"Ease my conscience but please keep them out of view"
No right to live even before life
"Too big a burden prepare the knife"
Maybe the world's the one that's mentally disabled

Grouped together in modern day asylums
No dignity as we force our views upon them

The love in those eyes I see
Not reflected by humanity
A childish fear of those who are different

The vilest prejudice society's accepted
All they have to give blindly rejected
