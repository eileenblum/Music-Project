Bleach my mind all hope inside
A path I walked misguided
Gave my life all understanding
To find a way one sided.

A whirlwind of anger to be unleashed
A mind carved twisted by all
To make my own decisions is unheard of
I am nothing at all.

My distorted view once force fed
My will was broken my life led
Caring not for what mattered to me
Confused and lost bound and free
Unbalanced I toss to and fro
Where will it end and what will I find

I am but a prisoner, on whom can I call?
From where I find the key sullen I fall
But to find it all to settle my daze
I must first find a way through the maze.

Clearly I see what was so unseen
I won't return to where I have been
The way is paved, marked with gold
I have someone to trust, someone to hold
My fears and confusion, my troubled soul
Embraced by Jesus, my life made whole.

Man is not master of his own destiny
But only of destruction
From each word, each thought, each deed
He must reap what has been sown

There is but one true God.
