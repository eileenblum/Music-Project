All aboard that's coming
Farewell to them that ain't
It's time for me to see the world
It's getting late
So I'll say farewell to Bristol and goodbye to Nailsea
And we'll let this Brummy come aboard 'coz he's good company
So why don't thee take a risk and come along with me?
It may be rough but at the end we all will merry be.

"Skipper, where we going?"
"A better place" sez He
You're just goin' nowhere fast
And so was we
The time'll come yer cider jar's as empty as yer head
And we'll be out at open sea with better things ahead
You don't believe in paradise after all we've said
Maybe I'll lose me breakfast, if I stay I'll lose me head

All hands around the capstan
Time to earn yer keep
The skipper says the wind is right
So walk and heave
We'll sing a song of where we're goin' and of where we've been
And we'll sing of them we left behind and them we're gonna meet
I'm sorry but I won't be back to tell thee what I've seen
But I know that all you'll see's the grass grow 'neath your feet

Farewell to merry England
The place that I've called home
Goodbye to those who've missed the boat
You're on your own
I'll think of them that tried to swim and them that tried to row
And tell them that's waiting on the dock for another ship to go
There's them that' happy left behind in ye Llendoger Trow
They won't be when they realise, they've missed the last ship home.
