I feel you gently as the wind blows
See you as the grass grows
Know you as it rains
I'm near you, sitting in the moonlight
You touch em when the sun's bright
No two hills the same
I hear you softly as the bird sings
You're fresh me with the pure spring
You feed me with the land
I see your beauty in the flowers
Your strength as it thunders
Your vastness in the sand.

I see you in autumn as the leaves fall
I wonder as a child crawls
In springtime the lambs
I marvel in winter as the lakes freeze
In summer with the cool breeze
All move with your hand
I see your might as the wave breaks
Fear you as the earth quakes
Love you in the fields
I bathe in your presence in the mountains
Your beauty as it transcends
Everything I feel

Guardians fail
Our world is neglected, destroyed
Love is denied
Creation's emotions are toyed
Creed prevails
The money that blinds thoughtful eyes
Progress they say
A gradual worldwide suicide
