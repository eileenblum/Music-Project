Words, they told me the words to say
They taught me the way to play
Not 'til now I know
Feel, the way I want to be free
But how can it be so real
When I'm feeling so low

So reach out and touch me, show me that you're there
Teach me how to feel you whisper that you care
I know that you're my shelter, my strength, my need, my all
So why's it when I'm feeling down, I can't feel you at all?

Touch me in a way that I'll know that it is you
Hold me and embrace me, make me something new
Fill me with your laughter, your life, your gifts, your all
Pull me up I'm in selfbound, so numb but soon not any more

You gave me life, gave me hope, gave me resurrection
You give your peace give your all
