This deeply furrowed brow
Has seen the end of many years
Lines of laughter and of sorrow
This face was washed by many tears
I have lived a full life
Made my fair share of mistakes
I'm ready now to leave for home
But listen as my spirit waits

Listen to me child
I won't always be there
I've said all I can say
You must search alone
I know I've let you down
But He will never leave you
Just reach out your hand
He will lead you home

As my senescent body groans
To be relieved of mortal pain
Please don't cry for me
My time has come to live again
I'll pray that you will feel the Spirit
And remember words I've said
For I know that I'll live on
Even when my body's dead.

Listen to me child...

Why can't you see
What it means to me?

Listen to me child...
