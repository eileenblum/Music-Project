Smiley happy faces,
A hurt filled heart denied,
Who cares about the person,
If they look good from outside
Ignore my emotions
Let them eat away inside
Nothing left to live for
But at least I kept my pride.

Can you ignore love?
Can you endure hate?
Can you live a lie?
Deny the loneliness and pain?
Can you hate yourself?
Attain a darker shade?
Blindly paint your mask
And come and join the masquerade

A childhood fear, a trauma
Oppressed emotions grow
Tangled deep within
A time bomb waiting to explode
The oppressed becomes oppressor
Aggression now unleashed
Thus starts the vicious circle
But the anguish could be peace

There tsands your father
Crying at the pain
The perfect answer
Not an object for the blame

The hate, the fear, the pain, the tears, the lies
See through your mind, your pain filled eyes
Washed in the blood, your anguish dies

Your mind set free
Go out and live again
