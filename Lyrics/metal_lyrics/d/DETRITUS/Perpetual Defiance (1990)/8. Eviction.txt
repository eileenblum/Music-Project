Despicable deceiver, your stronghold's overthrown
We stand here to defy you, we are not alone
Your detrimental blows won't lead to our defeat
You've already been defeated, your reign is obsolete

Satan we rebuke you, we bind your futile deeds
the misery you've sent us won't bring us to our knees

Your reign of terror's ending, your time is drawing near
We know you cannot harm us, we stand here without fear
Creator of all evil, the architect of sin
Begone with him you demons, your death doth here begins

FOR OUR STRUGGLE IS NOT AGAINST
FLESH AND BLOOD
BUT, AGAINST THE RULERS, AGAINST
THE AUTHORITIES
AGAINST THE POWERS OF THIS DARK WORLD
AND AGAINST THE SPIRITUAL FORCES OF EVIL...
IN THE HEAVENLY REALMS

Die then in your hellfire, the battle has been won
You're given your damnation, your sentence from the Son
You'll burn in hell forever, the pain will never cease
Your twisted form decaying, there will be no release
