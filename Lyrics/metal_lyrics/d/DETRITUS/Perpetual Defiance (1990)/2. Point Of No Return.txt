The blind led you to the mainline
You already knew the way
You were chased there by the dragon
You knew you'd have to stay

Dying for the end
This is it my friend
Your heavens turned to hell
One trip too far, no more to tell

You've reached the point of no return
You're dying for the thrill
Inside fear burns
There's nothing left of you to kill

Drowning in the wishing well
You're losing all control
It took away your sanity
And now it takes your soul

You're dying for the only thrill you know
You paid the price, you traded in your soul
Dying to reach your only goal
Dying for nothing
