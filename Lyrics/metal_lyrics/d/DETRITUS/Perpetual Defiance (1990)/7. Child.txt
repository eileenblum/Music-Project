I've walked with you my child
Since days were born
You've turned the other way
Fled from my arms
I never left your side
I never strayed for a day
There's nowhere you can hide
My love won't fade, won't fade away

Child although you've strayed
I will welcome you back with open arms
You, you are my love
You are my breath, my creation rolled into one

I'd carry you my child
If you'd let me
But I must let you go
Why can't you see
I sent my Son for you
Was it in vain
But now you break my heart
Ignore the pain, ignore the pain
