Singing of death, singing of hate, singing of demons and ghosts
Twisting their minds, taking their souls, digging their graves with your 
boasts
Just for an image, just for the rhyme, words that you don't even mean
Singing of things you don't understand, making your life so unclean

You're doing the devil a favour
Your payment is waiting in hell
Instead of a friend an enslaver
You don't have to believe to fall under the spell
Using your words for destruction
But its harder to build than destroy
Unknowingly used for seduction
No power is yours, your just used as a toy

Why do you look down to the grave, you know there's more power elsewhere
Don't have to be cruel, don't have to be evil cos' of the length of your 
hair
You look to the witches, you look to the devil, why don't you look higher?
D'you wanna be slave? d'you wanna be burned? so why d'you play with fire?

You sing the words but you don't mean what you say
You play his game but he'll take you one day
You use a force that is real, one day you'll pay the price
Please understand, he'll trick you, he'll fool you
You'll do his work 'cos you're his slave
Tou can change the path that you're taking
But there's only one way...

He will betray you taking your soul
Torture and enslave you, who's in control? (not you)
Have you the guts not to conform
Join us against him, no longer mourn...
