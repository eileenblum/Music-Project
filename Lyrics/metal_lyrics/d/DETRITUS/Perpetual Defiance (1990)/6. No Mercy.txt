You take it day by day, waste your life away
You only live once but for your ignorance
There's a price you'll have to pay
You take no notice of the signs
Don't read between the lines
Got it in your head that it's over when you're dead
But it's too late to look behind

Mercy
Wasted the time you lived
Too late
There'll be no mercy on judgement day
No mercy!

Did you hear the things I said?
Did they enter in your head?
Spat them back at me, wouldn't listen carefully
But you could not be forcefed
Will you ever see the light?
Will you stop your endless fight?
There's two ways you can go and you're going down below
But the smoke impairs your sight
