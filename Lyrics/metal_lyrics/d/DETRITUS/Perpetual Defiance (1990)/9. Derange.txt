What causes you to act the way you do?
What draws this anger up from the very soul?
Are you as insane as the things that you do?
This isn't the way it was meant to go

I just cannot feel
I just can't believe
Are you insane?
What you do is derange

Derange, throw into confusion
You take what doesn't belong to you
You rip you tear just to get your fill
Don't care 'bout the scars or the blood you spill

Your actions create an anger I've never felt before
Anger 'bout something I never ever saw
Your emotions aroused, your aggression released
You seek to pillage, the man is now beast

I don't know how you feel
I don't know what to say
All I know is it wasn't meant to be this way

For you it's over but for her it's just begun
It's now in her mind so where can she run?
She lies awake, it's happening again
You don't know but it's driving her insane
