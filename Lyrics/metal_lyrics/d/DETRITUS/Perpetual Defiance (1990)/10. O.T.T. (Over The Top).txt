Prejudice is one thing that I hate
Blindness by those who can't relate
But one thing that I cannot stand
Are those who on the other hand
Are fighting against prejudice
And they become the hypocrites
They want to be more equal than the others

Don't get me wrong
Fight while you're strong
But don't take it too far
You'll become as bad they are

Some feminists just want to rule the men
Equality means something strange to them
If for the men it was all fair
I wouldn't have to cut my hair
To get a job or gain respect
Equality should be in effect
They want to be more equal than the others

Blind men taking rites from me
All should have equality
Different, but all the same
All looking for somewhere to lay the blame
