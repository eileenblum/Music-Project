I awoke damning the light and knowing that I'm all alone
the darkened room's silver light,
('tis) a darkness so subtle
I (can) still see
The ghosts of all that has passed and come from our one tryst
The burrow's humid and warm
but the cold is so deep in my bones

My naked skin is peeling
attempting to shed what was once the mark of your scent on my flesh
Revolting is this feeling
A haunting I cannot embrace
nor escape from at all...
Such emptiness!
Alone I stand and heaving
adrift on a sea of inadequate foam
covering all (and) corroding me

I can't stand my sight
I must seek the night
bury my damned feelings I must kill my illusions,
I... I hope for burning skies rather than this pain!

Sanity's such a joke when one is broken!
Feelings are such a drag,
a bastard-god's little token!
I am no one at all!
Don't bother to know me!
A soiled mangle of lies...
I scream but nobody listens!
Embracing my deepest fearsâ¦
And I' m left with nothing!
My words are spent in a dream
for one that doesn't believe them...
(I'm) raping the love of my once giving soul!

if only light would not make you blind
then maybe I could know you!
if only I could bring down the sky
and make the seas tempestuous! ...

I am damned and rotten inside
this dreadful feeling must die
A tower of utmost gut wrenching pain
My exterior is so pale and stale
eyes so dead no one can tell what I think or feel
It's all lies!
See the crafted smiles I can display
Fooling all, for none can see
But nobody knows what it's like inside!
I self-exiled of all human touch
Estranged from the warmth I had sought
breaking the heavens and crumbling inside ...
Who answers for my pain???
All is done in vain???

O, I should've run from this place...
Could not stand your face
to behold nevermore the defining grace
O, I plead...
Cannot (they) see what it brings in me!?
Let the frost enter my veins for my sense is lost

Could not face my own gaze as I saw (it) in yours
Taste my tears!
Know my pain!
Nothing is the same!
Will not once see through my eyes and seek my embrace!
...fill this empty space...
