Ah, I rise and I fall within this wasted man shell
Oh, what am I to do!? (I'm) not alright
The dam might burst at any moment
Or, what am I to do with all these goddamn feelings
I am drowned in a pool of my own bile...
And my bleeding... it means nothing?
So they're laughing at me
Am I just so distorted?
Or perhaps it's the eye that quivers still
From all the blood it has begotten
And if only they knew that "she's the one that's twisted,
And if they heard...

How I simper, tear and shiver would they have some pity for me?
Or would they just point their fingers,
Throw the stones (and) so end my misery.

Truth be told, I never like my own reflection...
Found so loathsome
If I gave a damn about myself
I' d cut my loss and heal my wounds

What am I to do? I still bleed for you.
What am I to you? I am hollow through.

I cry out for some respite
But all I hear is my own voice.
I feel so cold and empty
I'll set my self on fire at times
I'd pry out my own eyes
If darkness could give me some solace
You'd squeal out when I need to take out my anger on my face.

It's all so wrong
It takes so long

Should there be, really, gods in heaven?
Would they not see it fit to destroy me?
And if perhaps there might be justice,
Burn out the cancer that lives inside us
This hateful thing we call emotion...
Such dreams, they plague me
Am I just crazy?

And if I could would I ignite them...
No, I'm not like that...
Oh, I'm not like that.

How I simper, tear and shiver would they have some pity for me?
Or would they just point their fingers,
Throw the stones (and) so end my misery.

Should there be, really, gods in heaven?
Would they not see it fit to destroy me?
And if perhaps there might be justice,
Burn out the cancer that lives inside us
This hateful thing we call emotion...
Such dreams, they plague me
Am I just crazy?

What am I to do?
Words, they just fall through
What are you to me?
Blunt atrocity
