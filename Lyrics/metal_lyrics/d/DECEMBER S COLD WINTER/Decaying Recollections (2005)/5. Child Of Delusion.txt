Heal me, heal me inside
I'm burning slowly, burning to nothing
Raise me, raise me with words of dire anguish
(then) lull to darkness
Cleanse me, cleanse me from all my broken thoughts
And bring me enlightenment
Heal me within this shell of dissent; limp as if lifeless

(I'm) Born of folly into despair
I am the child of a lesser god

Naught but lies and pain will follow
I am the child of a lesser god
All that love me shall be broken
I am the child of a lesser god
...child of a lesser god.

In me all is laid waste by my lies
In these eyes of dead-sight hate is ripe
Open up the trove of alibis

In my wake all is dead, all is prone for decay
Yet I strive to become something unlike the dead
As I stride to the end damned inertia awakes

...Lapsus of pain
I am not one to be taken lightly
I am dust, decay and bleak dismay
A true fallen one
...Eternal strain
I am not one to be taken lightly
I am dust, decay and bleak dismay
A true fallen one

...Lapsus of pain
I am not one to be taken lightly
I am dust, decay and bleak dismay
A true fallen one
...Eternal strain
I am not one to be taken lightly
I am dust, decay and bleak dismay
A true fallen one

(I'm) born of folly into despair
I am the child of a lesser god
Oh, so empty
(I'm) Sore and broken
...vilifying my own image in the eyes of fate

...A most pitiful fool
Unusually cruel and bent on disaster
Blight of words so untrue, they cut you right through...
No blade is faster
So my exploits will grow my webbing unfolds and woe is my master.

I'm wretched and wrong,
Dare touch me when won't on
Maddening laughter
Chains of sordidness move
On rivers of grue and harbor disaster.
Seek through endless unrest the fondest caress
And know vileness' truest form
I am a worm.
