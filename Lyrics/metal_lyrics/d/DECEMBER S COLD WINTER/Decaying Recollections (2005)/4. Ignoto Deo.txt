In the dead hours of night
sweating verses out of spite
madness wispers in my ear
into bitterness I steer
unknown hatred from within
Chains of reason wearing thin
pools of darkness 'fore my eyes.
smile whilst something in me dies

Lightning in the air
time deforming
Torn in disrepair
blood is curdling
doubt and disbelief, it has found me
bedlam is the key
Can't conceive it

Singing at god's cradle
as he slept (came the) dark fable

Spill my bile over the furnace
in my mind, open the gate
In my eyes...
See the one shrouded in blankness
In his mind, beckoning doomsday
In his eyes...
Spill my flesh over the furnace.

What is coming over me?
Satire of necrology
lost for pain in all it's glory
"widdershins" a dying story
most disturbing of all dreams
world is rotting at the seams
tap into the undivided
dream his face and be ignited

Seek his eyes and you'll be blinded
There!
The root of his anatomy
the light cannot pierce him at all
the darkness is broken in him
follow his unending path
and lose yourself in the tides of time
that he has broken to make all anew

If I gave you sin
the worst within
Would you want it?
Would you take it from me?
If I gave you love
come from above
you would take it
and then worship till death
If it were real
How would I feel?
Would I worship it
or turn my back on it?
For the pain the world can bear is real
Would you suffer it to there with him?

Wouldn't it be great if this fancy of mine were true?
Like so many creeds it simply falls through
the gods created man...
and man returned the favor?

The pain I feel is real
Where is the one you favor?
The pain you feel is real
Who would smite your tormentor?
The pain I feel is real
Where is your precious savior?
The pain we feel is real
Why won't they hear our prayers?

If only it were real
If only I could feel
