Profane mists of elder days
cloud my frozen veins
visions of strange planes
feed my fetid state
with horrid sights,
raping my mind and soul

Insane! The lake is roaming with nymphs
sadistic array of vicious mistfolk
harrassing my deathbed
underlings of underdarkness calling

Small ones rip open my dreams
dancing to the tune of elven witchcraft
bringing to my tree
the ruin of dreadsworn fools.

Augean lore portents the uprise
ashen grey, my eyes now fester
rotting faeries fall around me
opal virgins let their watersâ¦

â¦Soak my festering wounds
and wet my ardent tongue,
Hark!
Virulent and pristine,
the white clad savage dryads.
my legs astride,
the dark queen mounts me,
pulling my flesh from me
Throat ablaze
my body quickens
rank worms exit my rotting phallus

Out of my limbs sprout winged things
extracted from me the seed of the lake
chrysalis shamed
I'm full of taint
my bowels take flight and ravage the night

Augean lore portents the upraise
ashen grey, my eyes now fester
rotting faeries fall around me
opal virgins let their waters dry

Seep through the window sill
fog of toxic breath
to tear my rot apartâ¦

My vision is fed a new world
my sentience is drowned in the pools
as dawn wakes the soil on which i now rest my truth awakes
