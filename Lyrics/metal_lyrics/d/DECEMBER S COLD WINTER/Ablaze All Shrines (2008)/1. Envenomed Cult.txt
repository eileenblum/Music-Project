[Lyrics: Max / Music: Max &amp; Isak]

You, the one disguised
Nonsense emotions and lies
Filthy blessings thrown
Cult of oppression, a cross for each soul
Minds erased, condemned
...Delusion, instilled truth
Your god, spawned, human disarray
Bread and blood, the seal
Beneath the lies, mindless curse
Meat and wine, disease
Your god, spawned, human disarray
Bread and blood, the seal
Beneath the lies, mindless curse
Meat and wine, Burn!
Behold...
Behold the fiends spread
Shown as a sacred birth
Seeds of hate and despair
Deeply rooted in them
Your word, their minds as one
Carnage in the name of god
Enthroned mortal lie within
Venom the path to eternity
Skinless lambs
Damned souls
Unholy saints
Their hands also covered with blood
Scorned, emptiness
Sworn, non-existent salvation
Raped, useless perception
Breed of souls, deep aberration
Your god, spawned, human disarray
Bread and blood, the seal
Beneath the lies, mindless curse
Meat and wine, disease
Your god, spawned, human disarray
Bread and blood, the seal
Beneath the lies, mindless curse
Meat and wine, disease
You, the one disguised
Nonsense emotions and lies
Behold the fiends spread
Shown as a sacred birth
