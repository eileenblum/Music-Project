[Lyrics: Max / Music: Max &amp; Isak]

Abruptly awake, afraid
Black tide embraces my skin
Limbs tied, motionless
Joints welded, toxic pain
Organic flux unleashed
My body melts within
Slowly infiltrate
Thick liquid in my veins
Thereâs nothing to preserve
This is the judgment day
Forced Cancer ingest
Covered Cornea exposed
Living nerves destroyed
Rotten waste - stench
Horizon tainted, dead
Sad glance to human's faith
My corpse is not alone
Weâre gathered in decay
Where true life use to thrive
These Human hands... Destroy!
Black garden's sculptures
Living dead still
Penance impulse
Misery imposed
Breathing... Viscous... Souls
Forced Cancer ingest
Covered Cornea exposed
Living nerves destroyed
Rotten waste - stench
Horizon tainted, dead
Sad glance to human's faith
My corpse is not alone
Weâre gathered in decay
Where true life used to thrive
These Human hands... Destroy!
