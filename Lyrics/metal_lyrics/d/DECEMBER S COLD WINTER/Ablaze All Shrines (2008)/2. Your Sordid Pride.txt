[Lyrics: Allan / Music: Max &amp; Isak]

Torrents of blood on the orchards of fate
Men led astray by his gain and his hate
We were embraced by the potent dismay
Tearing away our will to awake
Now the plague corrupted our ways
The poor dying bled as equality drains
Oathsâ¦ burnt awayâ¦
Liesâ¦ tyrants domain
â¦Age of disgrace, decades of pain
Faults beset our wilted justice
Wars will bring no peace through murders
â¦Who will defend us from ourselves?
Children die in callous hunger
As the world delights in glamour
â¦Who will defend us from ourselves?
Deny â your failures
Deny â your gold-thirst
Come forth; behold,
What weâve done to this earth
Deny â these killings
Deny â transgressions
Come forth; behold,
What weâve done to this earth
Deny â youâre guilty
Deny â your soreness
Come forth; behold,
â¦Your praiseworthy deceit
â¦Killed by sordid prideâ¦
Nature torched by the unconscious
Fauna raped by pale invaders
â¦Age of disgrace, decades of pain
Filled with pride enhancement conquered
As the world delights in glamour
â¦Who will defend us from ourselves?
Rotting dried decrepit carcass
This earth dies, by us forsaken
â¦Who will defend us from ourselves?
Hateful mean revengeâ¦
Waves will flood our weak earth
Most will rest impaledâ¦
By the wicked monarchs spells
Hellish abattoirâ¦
Carnage unleashed â war their resource.
End this sick decay!
Deny â your failures
Deny â your gold-thirst
Come forth; behold,
What weâve done to this earth
Deny â these killings
Deny â transgressions
Come forth; behold,
What weâve done to this earth
Deny â youâre guilty
Deny â your soreness
Come forth; beholdâ¦
â¦Your praiseworthy deceit
