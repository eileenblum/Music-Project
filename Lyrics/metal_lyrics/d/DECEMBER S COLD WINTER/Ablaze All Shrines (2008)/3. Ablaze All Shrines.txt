[Lyrics: Allan / Music: Isak &amp; Max]

Bring your pristine, before my eyes
Claiming more blood as a proof of devotion
We'll defy temples, icons, and false gods
Forced to beseech, and to worship lies
Shedding the blood of the innocent martyrs
Meekness has conquered disciples and doctrines
Pain, wrath -mixtures tearing us from the inside
War, misery -mixtures leading mankind to genocide
We shall ablaze all Shrines
We shall ablaze all Shrines
Fiend for terror - mangled cultures
Blinded saviors died neglected
Hollow eyes stared unconscious
Slaughtered sheep - sacrificed
Empty words of hope, opium of the masses
Sick religions ripped our visions
Horrid cults redeemed extinction
Captured minds denied the rapture
Strangling dogmas shut our voices
Condemned spirits
Wrathâ¦ Forceâ¦ Destroyâ¦ Ablaze
Pain, wrath â mixtures tearing us from the inside
War, misery â mixtures leading mankind to genocide
We shall ablaze all Shrines
We shall ablaze all Shrines
Pigs have decor, democracy with sores
They seemed delighted by the masses stillness
Hordes hung and bled in the name of their âpolisâ
Rid your disease, vile rotting whore
Most of your sons were slain by your judgments
Raised in your ruthless sadistic ideals
Come mighty fears
Come sculpt the weak
Let your fake idols draw all the guidelines
Cold-blooded murders have baptized thy servants
Plastic faces defined you
Obscure sights driven decrees
Imposed fears bounded your weakness
All these bastards in flamesâ¦
Free your Soul
Kill their Gods
Temples disgraced
Ablaze all Shrines
