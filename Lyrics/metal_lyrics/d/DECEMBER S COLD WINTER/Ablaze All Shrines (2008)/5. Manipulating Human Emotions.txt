[Lyrics: Isak / Music: Isak &amp; Max]

Insignificant life submerged in everlasting decease
Corrupted minds dominate and destroy the world
World infected by rotten religions
Contaminated by a blind and deaf god
A life we never wanted
Anticipate the stench of death
Having souls ready for the last day
This pain will judge our thoughts
Like crimes returned to murderers
Your blooded hands betray you
Above the black abyss our spirit sways
Drowning the awake - Anguish of the soul
Manipulate the mass to gain power
Manipulate the world to gain respect
Manipulate the rites of mindless lambs
Nations erased
Do not believeâ¦
In the promise of eternal life
Do not believeâ¦
There is no justice for us
Manipulate the mass to gain power
Manipulate the world to gain respect
Manipulate the rites of mindless lambs
Nations erased
We donât believe in their godâ¦
Do not believeâ¦
There is no justice for us
