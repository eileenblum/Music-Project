[Lyrics: Max / Music: Max &amp; Isak]

Imposed power, lies and stress
Symptoms of manipulation, decadence of men
Betray your mind, your soul... Freedom as a sin
Believe the lie conceived, cycles of fear
Beneath their greed, domination
Die - die - suffer
Vultures and carrion - strips of my skin
Hate them, hate them
Palaces built with blood and flesh
Hide, hide, betray
They will betray themselves
...Again,
Kings of lie, praised
Flesh and bones blessed
Kings of lie, praised
Wounds inflicted
With bullets of lies and corruption
Venerate
Gods made from dust and perdition
Innocence
The fist of oppression
Ignorance
The sword of dark intentions
Speeches of misinformation
