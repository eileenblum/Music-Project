approaching to the madness, farther the selves
playing the roles would feed it, a new layer of life
walk around the mind, the shaped waves of lies
the way to stay is to see the truth it hides all

I'm observing the pain that grows in me
somewhere in silence I scream...

[Verse 2:]
poisoned mind expands the growing void
conflicts of thoughts make the chaos inside
as visions pass through the frames of time
nightmare begins while the eyes are open

[Chorus:]
Behind the mask we all rise
so far away from our selves
someone live with his resentment
Behind the mask we all rise
so far away from our beliefs
someone lives without Commitment

[Verse 3:]
as the silence breaks with influx of words
absence of hope can be felt more than ever
and the last rays of the sun go so cold
while the echos fade and the landscape decay

I'm observing the pain that grows in me
somewhere in silence I scream...

[Chorus:]
Behind the mask we all rise
so far away from our selves
someone live with his resentment
Behind the mask we all rise
so far away from our beliefs
someone lives without Commitment

towards the storms it moves
reach for the rise and the fall
life sailing off to another failing part
for we're the only destroyer of all

I'm observing the pain that grows in me
somewhere in silence I scream...

[Chorus:]
Behind the mask we all rise
so far away from our selves
someone live with his resentment
Behind the mask we all rise
so far away from our beliefs
someone lives without Commitment
