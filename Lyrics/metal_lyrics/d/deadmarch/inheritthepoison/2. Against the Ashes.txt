new world ain't include me
this loss suffers my thoughts
hope this hollow heart,
not to break apart...

they feed my mind against myself
but no one would care
to resist, the reasons all exist
they'll never see my despairs...

denials, can't ruin me again
now it's time to prove myself
they can not change their words
just to draw me back...

as every dying things obtained by their cruelty
nothing remains but pains
they're possessed infirmity

[Chorus]
How can we fly, farther than stars?
unless we break the root of chains
How can we feel, all for free?
Unless we feel the meaning of pains
I'll rise against the ashes
I'll rise against them all
I'll rise against the ashes
Now, watch them fall...

new world ain't include me
this loss suffers my thoughts
hope this hollow heart,
not to break apart...

they feed my mind against myself
but no one would care
to resist, the reasons all exist
they will never see my despairs...

[Chorus]
How can we fly, farther than stars?
unless we break the root of chains
How can we feel, all for free?
Unless we feel the meaning of pains
I'll rise against the ashes
I'll rise against them all
I'll rise against the ashes
Now, watch them fall...
