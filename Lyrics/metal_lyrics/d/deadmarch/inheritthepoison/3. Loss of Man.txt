Every day we cleave the landscapes of our thoughts
to find a way, to rid out of these pains
we're victims of their vortex
Like stillborn..
Under rotten flag of life
We're dead since long before...

Every day we pace, with future's shining trace
we lost our past and lose our present's grace
Don't see what they've become?
see through their heart
I see the darkness rising
We'll all break apart..

[Chorus]
Lost the way by the blindness of night
The man of truth, The man of light
For the sparks of the maiden stars
Hollow he chants the loss of man

By the charms of their blacken soul
I lose the power, I lose control
Pain of this surging sorrow
makes me Fragile, makes me hallow

Every day we prey, the hours pass away
This loss is more than I can take
They lost the humanity,for their insanity
but there's no soul behind the life with vanity

Every day we fail and fail for once again
I feel this loss through my veins
It's our blackened final, we think we fly
I see this loss that corrupts us
we're all left to die

[Chorus]
Lost the way by the blindness of night
The man of truth, The man of light
For the sparks of the maiden stars
Hollow he chants the loss of man

By the charms of their blacken soul
I lose the power, I lose control
pain of this surging sorrow
makes me Fragile, makes me hallow
