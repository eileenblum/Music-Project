[Verse 1]
every night the visions drown in complexity of reality.
and the sorrow expands as it pierce within my soul.
at the heart of deepest sands the new wilderness grows.
the root of all feelings, left unleashed and uncontrolled.

[Chorus:]
they'd hunt me down,
deliberately
I'll never lose the lead.
my life is chained, until I bleed..
they'd slay me down
for no reason.
if they take my life away.
my soul is free, I don't obey.


[Verse 2]
Illumination leaves me blinded as I passed the darkness
prisoned by a heart, that once has been torn apart.
possess the fake looming, entice the fake adherent.
the legacy of their chaos, leaves the death to inherit.

[Chorus:]
they'd hunt me down,
deliberately
I'll never lose the lead.
my life is chained, until I bleed..
they'd slay me down
for no reason.
if they take my life away.
my soul is free, I don't obey.

[Interlude]
My hands are chained throughout the time and space.
by the ones that eternally turn their face.
but I fly out of this viscous trace.
where there nothing rules but the human race.

Die by my side, something's wrong, nothing's right
Fail, prevail, are the same, while you obey . . .

[Verse 3]
their stagnant minds act as fire under liquids .
they hold me blind, but so late I comprehend.
eyes have dared to stare on what it was banned to see
as the poison dissects the blood from my soul.

[Chorus:]
they'd hunt me down,
deliberately
I'll never lose the lead.
my life is chained, until I bleed..
they'd slay me down
for no reason.
if they take my life away.
my soul is free, I don't obey.
