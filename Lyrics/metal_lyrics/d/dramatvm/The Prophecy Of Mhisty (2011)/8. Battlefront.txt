Release your anger
Dress with your faith
Get in the battle
Fight for your love or hate!

Not in the middle
not in the back
Iâm in the front line
The victory is mine!

You may be bleeding
Iâm sure youâll cry
Pain is for winners
Oh, donât fear to die!

I am no witness,
I wonât be told,
Iâm gonna live it
To live the battlefront!

Iâm gonna live it,
to live the battlefront!

Youâll see fog!

Iâm gonna live it,
to live the battlefront!

Itâs time to fight, itâs time to die,
you must free your sword.
Lost devotion from the faith,
on the emotion pain.
Every silence in the night,
youâre a slave of sound.
Darkness knight will fall to ground,
with their blood around.

In the bright of my eyes,
I burn enemies.
In the heat of my heart,
I keep all my feels.
When the final of fight
arrives to this time
Iâll feel still alive
because my blood runs in my veins.

Fight for your love or hate,
Donât fear to dieâ¦
(Youâll see fog, you know why?)
Iâm gonna live it, to live
To live the battlefront!
(Youâll see fog, and you know why?)

This is our revenge
You cannot take this place,
we may canât beat you,
weâre not afraid
Here are my courage and might.

This is our last stand,
with brave we take,
We are rivals, this is the age
Here are my courage and might.
