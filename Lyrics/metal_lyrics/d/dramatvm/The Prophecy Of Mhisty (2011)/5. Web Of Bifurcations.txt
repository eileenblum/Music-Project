Dark walls are moving,
messing the paths in confusion.
Avidity is real the one and only truth.

In a suffocated world of visions
your way is always wrong
between the hidden and visible to your eyes.

Infinite choices you feel in your road
but what you can choose is only one, only one.

Search for perfection is an endless desire
that seem so unreal, in your mind, in my mind.

If only you finally understand
to what your dreams reveal inside.

Infinite choices you feel in your road
but what you can choose is only one, only one.

Dreamlike answers youâll find.
To what your dreams reveal inside,
to what your dreams reveal inside.

When night fall, agony is real.
They defy to death and shadows.
Their inner selves betray them.
Obscure confusions flow in their souls.

With his power the labyrinth master decides
Crossing undefined paths, dark and rotten ways
(Obscure confusions)
Insane webs of sorrow, they find and divide
Youâll be tied up in its never-ending guts to his world
(flowing their souls)

Infinite choices you feel in your road
but what you can choose is only one, only one.
Search for perfection is an endless desire
that seem so unreal, in your mind, in my mind.
If only you finally understand
to what your dreams reveal inside.
Infinite choices you feel in your road
but what you can choose is only one, only one.

Dreamlike answers youâll find.
To what your dreams reveal inside,
to what your dreams reveal inside.

Lines without end of light.
Desires digress into eternity
Demons lost, black sunrise.
Web of death waiting for the crown.

[Interlude]

To what your dreams reveal inside.

When night fall, agony is real.
They defy to death and shadows.
Their inner selves betray them.
Obscure confusions flow in their souls.

For impossible realities, fake answers you will find,
through shining paths uncover the ways to walk.
(Obscure confusions)
All fades out, in the infinite web
and you return to a new start
(Obscure confusions)
questioning your dreams,
(flow in their souls)
denying the truth of you.
