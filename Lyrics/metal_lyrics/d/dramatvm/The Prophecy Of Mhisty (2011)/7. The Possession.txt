Mhisty cultus noctem altimus de versus
mortem ombra Altimus qui verto
suus regno Invocado en desertus
Ille erraticum desertus.

Mhisty cultus noctem altimus de versus
mortem ombra Altimus
Ignis de amarus lucesco Praebeo afflictio
noster evanesco Amarus

Free yourself in my name
(Around me the darkness pulls me)
Oh, Lord of the Abyss
(Towards the ambition)
Turn on your fury
(I will live, not you)
And spread it on me
(Your words reminds that time)
Being darkness sunrise
(Now youâre my thoughts, insane)
Let me feel your sinful flame
(and possess you with my greed)

The water flow,
in this place, on me
Waiting for my time.

The water flows
for my blindness,
in this place on me
For my blindness,
in this place on me
in this place on you.

Waiting for my time.
Oh I listen that fog
I listen that fog.

Fog!
I listen that fog!
