When the end of all time has come
and the next age arrives
I am trying to feel the fear
listening to my destiny.
I am talking just words on the wind,
listening to my destiny.

All the chains,
break down before my
growing strength
my power fades in the darkness
(My power fades)
an open cracks and I see
that I'm far away from my truth.

Walking through my lonely path I fall
trying to recall where I come from
mandatory exodus. A dungeon is my solitude.

All the chains,
break down before my growing strength;
my power fades in the darkness,
(My power fades)
a fire of fury slowly grows
and anger lights my own vengeance
against the one who dared to face me
and set me off in the darkness
an open cracks and I see
that I'm far away from my truth.

Nemus  herois  liberavit
ea servitÃ»s catÃªnis ignis
nostrem vÃ®tÃ¢m alicuen aetus
tÃ´to orbe terrarum poter

Nostem mentem oni forticuem
mentem verum quae se rei ila
ipsa brevis umbras intendum
a enigma infinita semita ignis

Poter inclinatu at estabilitas
dÃªstruÃ´ae portas ae inpenetrue
pauchis expedian in caeli
Misterium nÃ¢tÃ»ra vÃªritÃ¢tem
in profundo senit abstrasit

Nemus herois liberavit
ea servitÃ»s catÃªnis ignis
nostrem vÃ®tÃ¢m alicuen aetus
tÃ´to orbe terrarum poter
