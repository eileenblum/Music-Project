The old moonâs been watching your step,
she knows the secrets you kept,
in your memories seeking your future, your past,
an unstoppable yearning comes back to your side.

The dark hair reflects her force,
the voice and creator strength,
protector of secrets and signs,
mistress and goddess of signs.

Every memory of her life
is a reflex cared into your eyes;
every look is a flame,
itâs a guiding spirit for us to chase.

AÃ¤ranun Dea the spirit of war,
protect forever my road in the pain.

The old moonâs been watching your step,
she knows the secrets you kept,
in your memories seeking your future, your past,
an unstoppable yearning comes back to your side.

The dark hair reflects her force,
the voice and creator strength,
protector of secrets and signs,
mistress and goddess of signs.

Every fear in her life
is a thorn inside her heart
every tear in her skin
freezes the fire in her veins.

AÃ¤ranun Dea the spirit of war,
protect, forever; my road in the pain.

Maiden of war, maiden of Gods,
floating my promise.
Time, end of time.

AÃ¤ranun Dea the spirit of war,
(Protect my pain)
protect, forever; my road in the pain.

Floating promise in the wind,
I see time end of time.

And from the beginning was guide and light,
preparing the age of the chosen ones;
waiting for a timeless love,
The Ancient Moon waits for eternity.

Maiden of war, maiden of gods
floating my promise
Time, end of time.

AÃ¤ranun Dea the spirit of war,
(Protect my pain)
protect, forever; my road in the pain.

The old moonâs been watching your step...

AÃ¤ranun Dea the spirit of war,
protect, forever; my road in the pain.

Floating promise in the wind,
I see time end of time.
