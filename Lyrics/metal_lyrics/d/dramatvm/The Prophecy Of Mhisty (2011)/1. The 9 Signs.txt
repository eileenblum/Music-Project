Mhisty, Eluth, signs together.
Falcon, book, throne, spirit.
Inside me, inside my heart,
waiting me: sings alive.

Hiatus, seer, ancient moon.
Around me the mighty signs.

The signs, among me inside my heart,
These signs that made me.

Nature and instinct define you,
destiny is calling, waiting you,
you donât hear it, you donât notice it.
Time will make memories fearless.

A duality. 
(Power in no one, in nowhere)
Power in no one, in nowhere.
(Power in no one, in nowhere)

The falcon whisper for my freedom,
the knowledge and meanings, 
keeps the lost words,
those that guide my feelings,
I see words and worlds, I see...

Immortality.
(Power in no one, in nowhere)
Power in no one, in nowhere. 
(Power in no one, in nowhere)	

Somewhere inside, 
the words of night consuming me.
Hiatus in middle of me.

Feel the power among these signs,
deep in my thoughts, inside my mind,
seeking around this ancient land,
you will find, you will find your destiny.

I spell my fears
(Into the air)
In night, in night
(IÂ´ll lost myself)
I feel my dreams
(Forever free)
Inside my mind
(Dreams and signs)

Mhisty is life, 
keeps our signs forever alive.
Power rises keep your faith 
Forever alive.

The signs, among me inside my heart,
these signs that made me.

Evolution rounds us because,
she doesnât need us; 
skips the time we call eternity.
To feed our body, our spirit,
the time she keeps us alive.

Then she kill us.
(Power in no one, in nowhere)
Power in no one, in nowhere. 
(Power in no one, in nowhere)

Always searching throne of conscience,
protecting and hearing your meaning,
to see your hands, to see your marks,
seeking riddles, signs and waiting darkness!
Power in no one, in nowhere!

Misty, Eluth, signs together. 
Falcon, book, throne, spirit.

Inside me, inside my heart.
Waiting me: sings alive.
Hiatus, seer, ancient moon.
Around me, the mighty signs.
