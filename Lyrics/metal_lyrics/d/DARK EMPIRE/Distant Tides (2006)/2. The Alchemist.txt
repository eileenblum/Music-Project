[music: Moliti / Krull, lyrics: Moliti]

"...and... from the essential saltes of humane dust
a Philosopher may... call up the shape of any dead
anscestor..."
[Borellus]

Hidden away
A dark legacy
Unearths itself
Just for me
Secrets untold
My ancestors world
Brought back to life
Alchemy
My reflection in the canvas
Staring back at me
A portrait hiding knowledge
From forgotten centuries
Written in demonic texts
I'd conjure up the dead
But what I thought I could control
Took hold of me instead

[Chorus:]
Under control
From beyond space and time
Slowly it will drain away
My life
I see his face
Like a mirror to mine
The Alchemist will return
He will return
Oh but I shall be gone
Deep in the earth
I found his work
Frozen in time
Now I see
Ashes of man
An ungodly plan
Risen to life sorcery
What did I uncover
Tell me, what did I just see?
Murals paint remains of
Some bizarre monstrosity
Following the dragon's head
He rose up from the dead
A living corpse reborn again
From which I can't defend

[Chorus:]
Under control
From beyond space and time
Slowly it will drain away
My life
I see his face
Like a mirror to mine
The Alchemist will return
He will return
Oh but I shall be gone

[solo]

Now my time is ending
In a realm of misery
A portrait brought to life by
Supernatural mystery
With my dying breath
Hear my warning I have said:
"Don't call up what cannot be brought down"

[Chorus:]
Under control
From beyond space and time
Slowly it will drain away
My life
I see his face
Like a mirror to mine
The Alchemist will return
He will return
Oh but I shall be gone
