[music: Moliti, lyrics: Moliti]

Dawn of a new day the world is afire
Awake in emotional haze
You struggle to live then you lay down to die
A bolt in the wheels worn away
How long can we hold out?
A shallow game that plays on every
Day to please our kings
Our lives held by their strings
Turn on the light let your eyes crystallize
Your view set by just what they say
A color to sway - don't believe his lies
The angel's a demon disguised
How much more can you take?
Rise up and claim deliverance from
All this tyranny
Just look and you will see
Devils play
Sadistic games
For the world to see
Shall we let them claim
Their victory?
No we won't

[Chorus:]
Freedom shall survive - tonight
Blind lead the blind but
We will never die
Free yourself from lies - tonight
Open your eyes 'cause
We will never die
Now is the chance for us all to strike back
Alive with vainglory for change
A brave new world is at our constrain
So brace yourself for the attack
No more will we give in
A strength breaks through, a phoenix rises
Up to face the day
To never back away
Angels pray
To lift the chains
From morality
Shall we rise now to
Our victory?
Yes we will

[Chorus:]
Freedom shall survive - tonight
Blind lead the blind but
We will never die
Free yourself from lies - tonight
Open your eyes cause
We will never die

[Solos]

[Chorus:]
Freedom shall survive - tonight
Blind lead the blind but
We will never die
Free yourself from lies - tonight
Open your eyes cause
We will never die
