[music: Moliti, lyrics: Moliti]

"The fear of blood tends to create fear for the flesh."
Since my birth, haunting visions
Have occurred to me
A strange power
Controlling my destiny
Burned in the fire
But my blackened soul has remained
My dark desire
Will infect this mortal plane
Lying here, left for dead
Bandaged and alone
A separate half I'll create
To undermine their throne
Feel your aggression
The taste of my hate inside of you
Feeds my obsession
Until the time you set me free
This was meant to be

[Chorus:]
Searching in my mind
Answers I seek to find
Oh to know the truth
Why my nightmares have
Come to life
How can I go on
Left to be on my own
Waiting for the day
To close my eyes and leave this
World... alone?
Remember me, your true self
Its who you must become
You and I, are one and the same
The Chosen One
Rock turn to rust
My minions rise and humanity
All turns to dust
None will ever stop my insanity
Banish it to the void
Seal your fate at once
Let the light take you in
See it through
I am immortal
Even if I'm wiped away
I can't be stopped, no
My influence has spread
Your kind is dead

[Chorus:]
Searching in my mind
Answers I seek to find
Oh to know the truth
Why my nightmares have
Come to life
How can I go on
Left to be on my own
Waiting for the day
To close my eyes and leave this
World... alone?

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Searching in my mind
All the answers now are mine
Now I know the truth you're
Still a part of me
Now can I go on
A soul divided now made whole
Waiting for the day
To close my eyes but I am
Not alone!
Waiting for the day
To close my eyes but I am
Not alone
