[music: Moliti, lyrics: Moliti]

The aftermath of the war
This is what I've been fighting for
They all fell by my hand
But what's it signify
How can I justify
On my last day, I'll make my stand
Infidels and heretics
Of this land I've cleansed
Some say I'm a murderer
But I've only followed my command

[Chorus:]
The Light - In the Northern Sky
It shines - Burning in my eyes
The Light - Guiding me back home
I will return someday
So lead me out into the fight
For my lord I'd give my life
On this eve, thy will be done
Their temples burning down
Their flag torn to the ground
I do believe this battle's won
Blasphemers I've crucified
Of their blood I've shed
Tonight again I ride out to the battlefield
For their fucking heads

[Chorus:]
The Light - In the Northern Sky
It shines - Burning in my eyes
The Light - Guiding me back home
I will return someday
In my mind I see their eyes
Men, women, children terrified
What if I'm wrong, how will I know?
The right path will someone show...
Never to be
Eternally
Banishing me
Straight to Hell...
Blasphemers I've crucified
Of their blood I've shed
Tonight again I ride out to the battlefield
For their heads...

[Chorus:]
The Light - In the Northern Sky
It shines - Burning in my eyes
The Light - Guiding me back home
I will return someday
