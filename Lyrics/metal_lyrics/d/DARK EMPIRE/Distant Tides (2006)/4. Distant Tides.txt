[music: Moliti, lyrics: Moliti]

Here I stand watching
The crash of the water parching
For the unknown
Beyond this violent shore
The deep of the gaping void
Will surely swallow you whole
Return is no option, only death
By the shadows of the dark
And every night
I dream of foreign lands
Unconscious memories
On golden shores
It's haunting me, calling me

[Chorus:]
Take me
Beyond the horizon
My destiny
Into the sea
Take me
The distant tides
Of my memory
Beckon to me
Now I stand wondering
Shall I risk my life for a dream
Still its so pure
I must find what lies beyond
The force of the ocean winds
Is sure to tear you down
Return give up all hope, you'll be under
By the light of the dawn
And every night
I dream of paradise
An ancient legacy
The crystal spheres
I've got to get back to it

[Chorus:]
Take me
Beyond the horizon
My destiny
Into the sea
Take me
The distant tides
Of my memory
Beckon to me
In the deepest of my dreams
I see it now
A phantom image etched into my mind
Now there's no turning back
I've made my choice
To sail to that legendary place
Or to my death

[Solo]

[Chorus x2]
