A promise was made, of fortune and fame,
"Just sign the dotted line."
You think you're so sly, so you drag me through a lie.
I resisted you, and you lay me down to die.

Attacked, a knife in my back,
Something I could not believe.
Recoiled in the wake, a twisted snake
Sheds it's skin, now true colors I see.

Standing tall, I cry out to the sky,
" No compromise, to the end!"
You try controlling me, your mediocrity,
That's not the way I'll be.

Nothing to say, it's my life, my way.
Oh, you crossed the line on that fateful day.
I'm sure that you'll pay.

Beg for your life, it's coming to an end,
By my hand you can't defend, it's your demise.
Now I defy your insanity, my friend,
So to hell your souls I'll send,
Your salvation is denied.

Now I'm back, regrouping for attack
Nothing is in my way
Soon you will see everything that I can be
A force so strong, you won't exist for long.

It shall be done to the end
Pathetic monarchy, your worthless blasphemy,
It's not the way for me.

Nothing to say, it's my life, my way.
Oh, you crossed the line on that fateful day.
I'm sure that you'll pay.
