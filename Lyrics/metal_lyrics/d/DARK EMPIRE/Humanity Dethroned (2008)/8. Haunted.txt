Morning sunlight fills my eyes.
Awake again I can't describe
What I've seen in the moonlight
On that cold November night.

On my way home, working late
Past the rusted manor gates
That's where I saw her standing,
Like frost suspended tree.

Taken away, my world shakes
Fallen to ash, my soul breaks
Moments of time escape from me,
Shattering all reality.

Eyes of an angel frozen
Beckoning closer, chosen
Trying to scream, but I can't speak
Embrace my fear, but don't know why.

This beauty that I see
Caught on the other side, I long to set it free.
Now she calls to me
Lead me through the dark I'm not afraid, no.
Leave this world behind, step into the dark and free my soul.

It's haunting me through all my dreams.

So it happens every night,
Taken by the other side.
All desires so fulfilling,
Passion burning through my mind.

And it's driving me insane,
Staying here, this mortal plane,
Now that I've tested wonders
From beyond eternal grave.

What's going on, this can't be
Stolen my heart, how could she?
A spirit, that's all, it's nothing more,
Scattering dust laid on the floor.

Eyes of an angel frozen,
Taking my soul, I'm chosen.
Do I stay here in longing,
Or face my fear and take my life?

And as I'm standing in the frozen air,
Waiting for death's embrace to take me far from here.
The time of crossing is approaching close at hand.
Now I succumb to the temptation, her command.

So, it's come for me
Walk through the mirrors of mortality
See the world behind
Death unites us all in the end for all time.

And now it comes, the end of days,
Awaiting all to turn the page.
I have no fear, 'cause I believe
This afterlife is just another dream.
