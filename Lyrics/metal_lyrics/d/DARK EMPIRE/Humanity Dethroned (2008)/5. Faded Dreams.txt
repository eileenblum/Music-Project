Shadows cross over my mind
Once bright stars are missing
A life turned with the seasons
The snowfall echoes of spring
Now I watch and wonder,
"Has it all been in vain?"
Living with false intentions
Is driving me insane

So, I find myself to be lost
Inside my head, wondering why
It seems so strange to me
It keeps spiraling on and on.

Faded dreams still whisper
From the depths of my mind,
"Remember your ambition
For the passion of life".

Grey from the passage of time,
One last leaf has fallen.
Awaken me from this venture
For my final redemption.

So, I find myself to be all alone
In this world. Tell me why
It seems so strange to me
Time is marching on and on.

Watching fragments of my past
Carved in stone
Weathered, they begin to crack,
To dust they've gone.
Like a sun-bleached photograph,
It brings me home
To the place the place that I forgotten
Exists at all.
