Fear! The darkness is all that I know
Lies! The force deep inside you, I grow
Destroy! You soul, mind and body are mine
Obey! I've taken what's yours for all time.

Shell of a man, can't understand, tell me why?
(Assimilation's begun)
Out of my head, senses are dead, throat is dry.
(A battle that can't be won)
Nothing to see, will I be free, nowhere to hide.
(The final hour draws near)
Losing control, taking my soul, am I to die?
(You've got nothing to fear)
Why are you here?

Control you, become you
This cannot ever be undone.
Inside you, I am you
Possession takes hold, we are one.

Now succumb to my presence in you
Resist? Don't fight cause there's naught you can do

Shell of a man, can't understand, tell me why?
(Assimilation's begun)
Out of my head, senses are dead, throat is dry.
(A battle that can't be won)
Nothing to see, will I be free, nowhere to hide.
(The final hour draws near)
Losing control, taking my soul, am I to die?
'Cause I am here... I'm in control!

Control you, become you
This cannot ever be undone.
Inside you, I am you
Possession takes hold, we are one.
The omen, the chosen,
Damnation smiles, it is done.
A bond that's unbroken,
Always forever, we are one.

Controlling you.
Becoming you.
Possessing you.
