Forsaken ground, the engines burning,
A bloody hand reaches out.
And for what cause do we fight this war?
Hypocrisy cultivates doubt.
Shattered souls, former lives,
Begging to be released.
Another civilian casualty
Lies dead on the side of the street.

Will we rise? Will we fall?
Can we save ourselves at all?
When the day is done, there's no sign of life.
One last spark, one more day
Final moments slip away.
In the setting sun there's no sign of life anymore.

Fire fights, napalm strikes,
Chemical warfare from planes.
So tell me now, justify somehow,
Loss of life for dogmatic gain.

Sons of the fallen arise from the dust.
Hatred consumes, gunfire resumes,
Marching forward they are lost. We are lost.

Waiting for an answer,
And will we ever see?
To crack through illusion,
The downfall of humanity.
With reason as our guidance
We make our final stand
Against a holy martyr
With a rifle in his hand.
