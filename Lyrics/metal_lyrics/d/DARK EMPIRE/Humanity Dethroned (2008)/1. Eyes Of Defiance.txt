Fallen, but I've just begun
Rebirth by the barrel of a gun.
Vengeance racing through my heart.
No end until you're torn apart.

Fear inspired,
The eyes of defiance see the truth.
Hate transpires,
The eyes of defiance burn into you.

Now I'm lost.
Through centuries I fly,
You will count the cost.
Like an obsessions, death steals my mind.
No remorse!
And when the night descends,
I bring pain and loss.
And through regression I am the end.

Another lifetime so long ago,
Wasted away like ash in the fire.
Another memory of places I know,
Taken from me. Reborn now, I will arise.

Incarnation of former lives
Inquisition of human kind
There's no better way to end
My redemption than with revenge

Shadows of the past
Are consuming all I see
Break on through the darkness
There's another chance for me
Once again inside me breathes the energy of life
Wash away the past, look into my eyes...
