Losing my grasp I walk awayÂ 
But now looking back, there's so much to say
Still in my darkest hours you stayed
Haunting my thoughts still to this day

Cold is the gaze that pierces
Like a nail through the cross
And eyes, frozen eyes of dispassion
Speak louder than words of hatred and lies

With sewn shut lips and bloodshed eyes
We burn the bridge of what was once our lives

[Chorus:]
From the remains I will arise
And shed not a tear for black hearts demise

Now with this chasm between us
Growing further and farther
We try, all in vain to recapture
What once was so pure, but weak as ice

With sewn shut lips and bloodshed eyes
We burn the bridge of what was once our lives

[Chorus:]
From the remains I will arise
And shed not a tear for black hearts demise
