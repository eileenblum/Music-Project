Welcome to your world of rejection
Where your truth rings forth as hollow words.
Difficult to look out from the inside
Alienating all the ones you've burned

Delusions of grandeur, stubborn insecurity
Consumed by your twisted inflatable ego disease.

All alone your search of validation
While your projected fears wreak havoc on the weak.
Incisive gossip fueled with rancor
Every lie you tell yourself sustains you as you speak.Â 

In a fog of self deception in the safety of your home
Who are you to stand in judgement of the ones you do not know?

[Chorus:]
Never mistake kindness for weakness
Or silence for stupidity
Best you withdraw that pointed finger
Lest ye be judged

Insanity - Audacity - Careless and self-serving
Duplicity - Toxicity - Penetrates the thickest skin
Hostility - Nihility - misdirected anger
Silently, passively, fear disrups your every thought.
Drifting through your fabricated worlds...

Audacity - Insanity - Only seeing black and white
Hostility - Nihility - Malignant narcissistic chaos

Poisonous pity, a negative clown
This chip on your shoulder keeps weighing you down.
Your low self esteem keeps its grip on your soulÂ 
As your shattered spirit spins out of control
And soon in the end, all is lost and you're gone
With no lasting impact, remembered by none.

In a fog of self deception in the safety of your home
Who are you to stand in judgement of the ones you do not know?
And within your self-delusion, thick with self-justified arrogance
Painting yourself into a corner
Where you will forever remain alone.

[Chorus 2:]
Never mistake weakness for kindness
Or cowardice for sanity
Best you retract your every word now
Lest ye be judged.
