A broken body lies upon the ground.
But still in twilight motion can be found
Red lines of crimson blood stream down my hands
The final grasp of life on liquid strands.

In your eyes I can seeÂ 
Rage, cold and frozen
No remorse for your deeds.

Over the edge I sent you falling down
An act of self defense away from harm
Our last disclosure still hanging in the air
Seduction of an innocent in tears.

Left within are agony, chaos and despair.
Shattered limbs and broken lives
Say goodbye one last time.

[Chorus:]
The world of shadows fills my eyes
And as I dream in vengeance, for your past I care not.
So take your last breath as you fall.
And as I dream in vengeance, for your past I care not.

I see my own reflection in the pool.
Around your body, growing slowly, death is coming soon.Â 
We fall into the fading night.
The sirens howl with burning lights.
And for the end that comes to bear
Awake, a dream I do not care.
Alone tonight obsession takes its toll.Â 

Left within are agony, chaos and despair.
Shattered limbs and broken lives
Say goodbye one last time.

[Chorus:]
The world of shadows fills my eyes
And as I dream in vengeance, for your past I care not.
So take your last breath as you fall.
And as I dream in vengeance, for your past I care not.
