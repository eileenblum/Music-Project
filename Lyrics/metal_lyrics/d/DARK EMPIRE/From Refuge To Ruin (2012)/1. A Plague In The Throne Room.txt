Regime obscene, another pleasant nightmare.
Behold untold vile obsessions (and bloodshed)
Believer deceiver, of promises you've broken
Unspoken refrains of a cancerous lie.

The poisoned crown of strengths unbound
Procession of evil, hypocrisy on high.
The poisoned crown of strengths unbound
Procession of evil, freedom slowly dies.

Stirring up unrest
Waves of dissent crest
And Crash on down

[Chorus:]
Watch the scourge infect the world
Black flags and altars
Crawling towards its languid host,
A plague takes its toll
With blood on the throne room walls.

This can't go on, it's not the way I see it
This game they play, I'll wage insurgence
And to the barons of oppression I shout
Defiance at the sky. This plague must die.

The poisoned crown of strengths unbound
Procession of evil, hypocrisy on high.
The poisoned crown of strengths unbound
Procession of evil, freedom slowly dies.

[Chorus:]
Watch the scourge infect the world
Black flags and altars
Crawling towards its languid host,
A plague takes its toll
With blood on the throne room walls.
