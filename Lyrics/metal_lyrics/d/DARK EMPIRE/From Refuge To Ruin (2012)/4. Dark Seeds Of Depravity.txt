In total corruption the parasites feed
Taking the lifeblood as they need
From those who'd surrender at the end of the gun,
Perversion of mankind has begun.

Neurotic deceiver, deceive what existence sells.
Nomadic believer, believe what desire tells.

[Chorus:]
Overload, the system explodes.
In the shade of devastation dark seeds grow.
Methodic pleas of insanity
Cultivate abomination, your dark seeds.
(Depravity)

Bathed in the red light down on your knees
Integrity seems a foreign dream
Humiliation for one night of bliss
Dionysus' deadly kiss.

How can you even face yourself? (My inner demons won't let go.)
A beggar cloaked in unearned wealth

[Chorus:]
Overload, the system explodes.
In the shade of devastation dark seeds grow.
Methodic pleas of insanity
Cultivate abomination, your dark seeds.
(Depravity)

Accepting that our culture is
Just human nature is a foolish lie, the death of pride.
Through all the ages, we've one tendency: survive.Â 

Neurotic deceiver, deceive what existence sells.
Nomadic believer, believe what desire tells.
How can you even face yourself? (My inner demons won't let go.)
A beggar cloaked in unearned wealth

[Chorus:]
Overload, the system explodes.
In the shade of devastation dark seeds grow.
Methodic pleas of insanity
Cultivate abomination, your dark seeds.
(Depravity)
