Out from the dark you came to me
Like a courtesan of grace and beauty
Pleasure me, enlighten me
Become my every fantasy and be away... a cold and distant state

And as the final curtain falls
Do you contemplate the role you played and stole?

[Chorus:]
Prepare the stage
And play your own psychotic masquerade
All entwined
In crimson hues, the self which youâve defined
All the same
You paint the portrait of your masquerade
All entwined
In crimson hues, your altered state of mind

And then at once you ceased to be
Like a stranger then, devoid of empathy
Turn from me, and lie to me,
Become the face of our entropy and hate... expressionless decay

And as the final curtain falls
Do you contemplate the role you played and stole?

[Chorus:]
Prepare the stage
And play your own psychotic masquerade
All entwined
In crimson hues, the self which youâve defined
All the same
You paint the portrait of your masquerade
All entwined
In crimson hues, your altered state of mind
