What men call hatred I can't explain.Â 
Who in society is to blame?
The self destruction that I see
Goes on and on and on in misery.

Still the hunger, numb the pain
It's all we are, always the same
'Till the soil blacken the earth
It's all we are, in death and birth

When I see bloodshed pouring like rain
And I se infants starved and slain
I see the tyrants cloaked like sheep
Telling us all we're kings of peasantry

Still the hunger, numb the pain
It's all we are, always the same
'Till the soil blacken the earth
It's all we are, in death and birth

[Chorus:]
Falling far, we're far enough but still remain
Carry on, into our darkest days

What men call hatred I can't explain
Who in society is to blame?
The self destruction that I see
Goes on and on and on for centuries

Still the hunger, numb the pain
It's all we are, always the same
'Till the soil blacken the earth
It's all we are, in death and birth

[Chorus:]
Falling far, we're far enough but still remain
Carry on, into our darkest days
