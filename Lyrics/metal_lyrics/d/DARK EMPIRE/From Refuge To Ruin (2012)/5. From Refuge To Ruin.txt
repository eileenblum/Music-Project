Fate of salvation, you pathetic lie
Death paints destruction into everybody's lives.
Leaving behind them far, far away
The ashes of everyone led astray.

[Chorus:]
Those born with less, less than a chanceÂ 
From odds they are up against
Masses to the west fleeing the stench of oppression.

Anthems to ideals perverting man
An age old widespread sicknessÂ 
Found in the snow and in the sand.
We all keep on running.Â 
Yeah we all keep on running.
Still we keep on running,Â 
But the plague stays right behind us anyway.

[Chorus:]
Those born with less, less than a chanceÂ 
From odds they are up against
Masses to the west fleeing the stench of oppression.

Wastelands, war games, Ww keep giving blame.
Classes, races, famine sadly just man...
Sadly, just man.

Though it's treacherous, forward we carry on.
Through perilous wastelands in hope to find our way home.
Are we left for dead? Are we space between the stars?
Are we standing still? I can't find it in my heart.Â 
Will you persevere with strength from an ideal of hope?
(With courage and pride)Â 
We're coming home.
Can you find the strength though you're torn apart?
You were left for dead, find it in your heart.Â 
Rise above this rage and their despotic gaze
And fight another day on this desolate and lonely road we're on.
We never belonged on this desolate and lonely road we're on.
