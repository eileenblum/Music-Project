After the voices are gone
After the fire and flame
When all the world has forgotten your name
There is void

I miss the anger
I miss the hate
Bring back the darkness
before it is too late

Give me my war
'cause I thrive on it
If the world is in pain
Then I want to be sure

Take me out of the void

I miss the anger
I miss the hate
Bring back the darkness
before it's too late
I miss the anger
I miss the hate
Show me the darkness
before it is too late

Out of the Void
By the death of a loved one
Out of the Void
By the rise of the fallen

When the world has forgotten your name
There is void

I miss the anger
I miss the hate
Bring back the darkness
before it's too late
I miss the anger
I miss the hate
Show me the darkness
before it is too late
