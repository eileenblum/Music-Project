There is a fire hotter than the sun
There is a fire that burns you eyes
It doesn't matter what sins you've done
They only fill you up with lies

TAKE A MOMENT TO CLEANSE YOUR SOUL
Trough the FIRES OF HELL
Another story to TAKE CONTROL
ANOTHER STORY TO TELL

There is no reason for you to fear
THERE IS NO REASON TO CRY
The only stories they want you to hear
ARE THE ONES IN WHICH YOU DIE

TAKE A MOMENT TO CLEANSE YOUR SOUL
Trough the FIRES OF HELL
Another story to TAKE CONTROL
ANOTHER STORY TO TELL

TAKE A MOMENT TO CLEANSE YOUR SOUL
Trough the FIRES OF HELL
Another story to TAKE CONTROL
ANOTHER STORY TO TELL

TAKE A MOMENT TO CLEANSE YOUR SOUL
Trough the FIRES OF HELL
Another story to TAKE CONTROL
ANOTHER STORY TO TELL
