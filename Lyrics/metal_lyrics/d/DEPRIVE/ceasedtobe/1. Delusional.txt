For now your sins are forgotten
You son of God
You hold the words of your father
To this day true

What if he were wrong
What if you were wrong

You are soon to be forgotten
So is your God

The consequence of pain
The truth about your life
Is slipping further down the wells of time
And all that you forgave
The forsaken and alone
As they found their piece
your deeds will not atone

The world is evolving, constantly in motion
Humanity can do without you and your faith
There will be no darkness, no resurrection of the dead
Your existence will fade out into oblivion

The consequence of pain
The truth about your life
Is slipping further down the wells of time
And all that you forgave
The forsaken and alone
As they found their piece
your deeds will not atone
