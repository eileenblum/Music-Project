Filled with disgust
I'm crawling on my knees
Weakened by hatred
Nothing puts me at ease
Another scar
DoesnÂ´t matter anymore
Left all alone
What am I fighting for?

I ARISE to see
what's become of me and
I CANNOT LET YOU PROVIDE
this drawn out suicide

Now it's time to RECOLLECT MY LIFE

I'm standing here alone
Where I don't belong
It is dark, it is cold
I've got shivers down my spine
I'm standing here alone
What I am searching for is gone
End this mourning
Embrace the hope of dawn

A shattered light
What is left of my faith
That is what you are
my MENTAL WRAITH

FORCED TO LAY LOW
And hide my shame LEFT IN DARKNESS
Stuck in a dead end
All alone WHISPERS OF SORROW
Nothing remains
And I'm to blame THROWN TO THE BOTTOM
IF IT CAN`T get any worse
THEREÂ´S A REASON TO TRY

I'm standing here alone
Where I don't belong
It is dark, it is cold
I've got shivers down my spine
I'm standing here alone
What I am searching for is gone
End this mourning
Embrace the hope of dawn

Embrace the hope of dawn

I'm standing here alone...
