Your sorrows all aligned
They are eating up your soul
You want to leave it all behind
Let your darkness take control

You feel it coming closer
A feeling far from your SERENITY
You feel it coming closer
BLEEDING, HURTING, FEEDING YOUR IDENTITY

Look inside you and break free of all the shackles in your heart
You will never find a better time to mend what was apart
Can you feel them calling, search and there's no telling what you'll find
How much longer can you stand the voices screaming in your mind

Now your standing on your knees
Religion is your last resort
A final pray for mercy
Until you cut the life support

You feel it coming closer
A feeling far from your SERENITY
You feel it coming closer
BLEEDING, HURTING, FEEDING YOUR IDENTITY

Look inside you and break free of all the shackles in your heart
You will never find a better time to mend what was apart
Can you feel them calling, search and thereÂ´s no telling what you'll find
How much longer can you stand the voices screaming in your mind

No more
No more
No more
No more
Can not fight it
Let me go
I do not have the power
not to let the hate inside me GROW

Look inside you and break free of all the shackles in your heart
You will never find a better time to mend what was apart
Can you feel them calling, search and there's no telling what you'll find
How much longer can you stand the voices screaming in your mind
