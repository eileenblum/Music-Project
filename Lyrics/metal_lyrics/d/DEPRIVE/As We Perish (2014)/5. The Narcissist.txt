I want to survive
I want all the hunger I use to have 
When we were at our best
Finally I want to feel alive

I must carry on
The result of my death would be madness
But when I am gone
All the hypocrites dying of sadness

This is my realm

It's all coming clear
There is still a lot more to claim in this world
The end is near
Don't worry soon truth will be unfurled

I must carry on
The result of my death would be madness
But when I am gone
all the hypocrites dying of sadness

I want my dignity
I won't let you disrupt me
This is my solitude
Thus I 
I am the world

I must carry on
The result of my death would be madness
But when I am gone
all the hypocrites dying of sadness

This is my realm
