He stand beside you
Feeding
He despises you
You east end harlot

You- are the one who got the blame
He - ended up with all the fame
Now - no one remembers your name
This - is what history became

Now the deed is done
Gutted
You're not the only one
Yet your memory will fade away

You - are the one who got the blame
He - ended up with all the fame
Now - no one remembers your name
This - is what history became

On a cold Novembers night
He became your deepest fear
In his arms your light went out
Along with all that you held dear

He was a creature of the night
An abomination amongst men
and his work is to be found
at no. 66 of 66 and 10

You - are the one who got the blame
He - ended up with all the fame
Now - no one remembers your name
This is history
