I've lost the battle
I've sunken deep into the abyss
I am forsaken
I can not comprehend this

If the truth will set you free
You are as locked up as you all can be

Alive, for a moment I was alive
I feel, but what I feel is never real

This is an act of treason
This is the truth on a silver line
We all stand alone
Turning our bloodshed into whine

If the truth will set you free
You are as locked up as you all can be

Alive, for a moment I was alive
I feel, but what I feel is never real
what I feel is never real

All I can control is out of reach

Alive, for a moment I was alive
For a moment I was alive
