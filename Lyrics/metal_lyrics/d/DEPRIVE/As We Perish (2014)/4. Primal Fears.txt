I do not see the reason why
I can not feel myself
I am afraid to look me in the eye
Reality is nothing but a cell in which I am confined
The simple truth is growing bigger every time I lie

I feed myself with sorrow
every time I try to smile
I feel the most alive the times I want to die

Life is a contradiction
I live in fear
The only time I cry 
is when I'm out of tears  

I can not live inside this hell
In fact I mean not to
I know in darkness I must dwell
Unless I kill what I've turned into

Life is a contradiction
I live in fear
The only time I cry
is when I'm out of tears  

Let me out 
This is the end of this life

I am my own enemy
This is my primal instinct

I got one foot in my grave
and only one good reason to stay

Life is a contradiction
I live in fear
The only time I cry
is when I'm out of tears
