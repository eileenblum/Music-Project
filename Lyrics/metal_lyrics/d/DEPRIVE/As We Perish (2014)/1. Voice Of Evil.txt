It is the same old story every time I close my eyes
A darkness suffocating me and leaves me feeling drowned
At night my only wish is to be sent into the skies
But every morning I find that I am still around

In every feeling that I feel, in every moment that I steal
In every trial and error life it seems is getting more surreal

It's getting more surreal

It is a constant struggle, forcing every single day
I can not care about your life or anything inside
My energy is lacking I don't hear what you say
The moment you start talking I start to slide

In every feeling that I feel, in every moment that I steal
In every trial and error life it seems is getting more surreal

It's getting more surreal

I fought you, I questioned you, I hated everything about you
It took some time, to open my eyes, to see the world
I am deranged, but I have changed my life into the better
It doesnât bother me at all, the world is fucked up, tangeled and twirled

In every feeling that I feel, in every moment that I steal
In every trial and error life it seems is getting more surreal
Itâs in the answers that I find, in every corner of my mind
A little voice of evil telling me to leave this world behind
