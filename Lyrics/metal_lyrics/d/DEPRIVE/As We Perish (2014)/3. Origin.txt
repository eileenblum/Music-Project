I wander off alone
This temple of contempt is not my home
Here I burn against my will
By obligations underneath the dome

I am defiled
By every word you planted in my head
I was denied
the possibility to see that god is dead

You - took my soul away
I - can not find a reason
Why - religion is alive
The origin of sorrow

I wander off alone
I've broken free from all my sins
It's coming closer
The liberation from my needles and pins

I see things clearer

You - took my soul away
I - can not find a reason
Why - religion is alive
The origin of sorrow

And still
you're waiting by my side
And still
you're poisoning my mind
you're eating through my heart

I've had enough of gods
I've had enough of faith
With every prayer you recite
The more I want to desecrate

Desecrate your church, your mind, your soul
Your strongest will I will defile

You - took my soul away
I - can not find a reason
Why - religion is alive
The origin of sorrow
