I am your pain and misery
Your heart and soul, your dignity
Controlling your emotions
Acceptance is your master key

I am defying all your will
Your deepest nightmares I fulfill
IÂ´ll have complete devotion
As you are heading for the kill

You are my creation, lost and alone

As you are falling further down
I'm by your side
Tormented through hell and back yet 
you still abide

I've come to adore you

You'll have my full attention
The day you've overcome your hate
Damnation's your ascension
As I am opening the gate

I'm sent here to destroy you
Let me hear your final word
Unless you're begging for forgiveness
I will let it go unheard

You are my creation, lost and alone

As you are falling further down
I'm by your side
Tormented through hell and back yet 
you still abide

You have that fire in your heart
Just like a mindful work of art
An urge to stay alive
To make a brand new start

I am your pain and misery
Your heart and soul, your dignity
Controlling your emotions
Acceptance is your master key

I am defying all your will
Your darkest nightmares I fulfill
I'll have complete devotion
As you are heading for the kill

As you are heading for the kill

As you are heading for the kill
