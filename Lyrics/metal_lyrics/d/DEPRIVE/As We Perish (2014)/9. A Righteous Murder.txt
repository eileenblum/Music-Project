I am forsaken by myself
But I want more
Tonight my hate became too real
still I want it

I have a feeling of survival
Tonight
I wanted you to feel what I have felt
Tonight

An eye for an eye
And I forgive you
I know you've lived a lie
But I want it now

It is a rightful vengeance
you have brought upon yourself
An evil hiding in the dark
Your time has come

I have a feeling of survival
Tonight
I wanted you to feel what I have felt
Tonight

My will is heard
You are forgiven
I know you've lived a lie
And the lie became true

My heart is dead inside
And my mind's a prison
I won't forget the pain I felt
And I want it for you

(I'm wanted now
I feel alive...)

I have a feeling of survival
Tonight
I wanted you to feel what I have felt
Tonight
I have a feeling of survival
Tonight
I wanted you to feel what I have felt
Tonight
