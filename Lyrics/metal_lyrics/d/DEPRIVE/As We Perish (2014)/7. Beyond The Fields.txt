It all became black and hollow
My heart felt empty, cold and bare
I knew you were the one to follow 
And then I saw you standing there

You took my light away
But I see the reason for her death
Somehow I didn't believe you
Until I saw her final breath

Take me with you, I am waiting
Guide me by your side, I'm suffocating here

When she found her peace
When she joined you by your side
She was released from her disease
As her fetters were untied

You took my light away
But I see the reason for her death
Somehow I didn't believe you
Until I saw her final breath

Take me with you, I am waiting
Guide me by your side, I'm suffocating here

An eternity beyond the fields of suffering

I want you to be my guide
I want to feel your final touch
I know it's for you to decide
I hope I'm not asking too much

You took my light away
But I see the reason for her death
Somehow I didnÂ´t believe you
Until I saw her final breath

Take me with you, I am waiting
Guide me by your side, I'm suffocating here
