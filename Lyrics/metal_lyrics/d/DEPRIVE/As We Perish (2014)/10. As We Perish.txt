Repent

She is near
It is time for evaluation
Who's plead will she hear
and who will be put to incineration 
An eternal condamnation
Is the one thing you won't fear
All your hopes and dreams 
She'll make them dissappear

The more you're trying to survive
The more you will be beaten down
One day, she will arrive
And we shall perish 

It's unavoidable
And you hold the blame
You'll know it in your heart
As you call her name
You will be broken down
There will be no resistance

Born and raised in fire
She knows your will
Driven by hate and desire
she knows

The more you're trying to survive
The more you will be beaten down
One day, she will arrive
And we shall perish 

As we perish
I'll hold you dear
And I'll cherish
My conviction
