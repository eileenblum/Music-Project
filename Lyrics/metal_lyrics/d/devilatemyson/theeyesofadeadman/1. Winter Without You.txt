he last birds leaving all of these dying lands
the golden splendour is not here to stay
the crystal air cuts in our frozen hands
You are nine thousand miles away

So light my way in this dark passage
Give me hope so I can sleep

In this bed the warmth won't come
This winter seems to be the end of my days

Please save me from this darkness and spent my body
rest
Exhausted by this long way I've to walk in fear
May heaven collapse above my weary head
I'm here. I'm waiting. kissing your
photograph

Time is slowing down.
when you're waiting for an end to come
In this bed the warmth won't come
This winter seems to be the end of my days
