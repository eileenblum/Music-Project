His world is in flames only shadows play friendship
How does it feel to be alone in the inferno
The eyes of..
Falling and drifting  the course remains unclear
He''s setting sail to better places
..a dead man
Pictures are about to burn
Love letters lost their value
This day he died alone in his fear
Clear traces on both of his wrists
Where the blade defeated the flash
And took him into oblivion
This day he died
His end in flames
