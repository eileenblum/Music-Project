fuck your ideals.
This is not the time I have to die.

I'm not burning down for you
I am not your fucking slave 
All the efforts made for nothing
Disregard sings me to sleep

I feel the war  within me growing
and all I wish is...  

Fuck your words. This is not the time I have to die.
I'm not longer the fuel. To your thirsty engine.

You will not break me. So let the hard times come.
motherfucker

the last man standing.
In a land where assholes rule
Resisting the coma
I will not be your tool
I walk towards the light

Through the years - I've learned to hate you
The fucking maggot - that you are
the sacrifice - you didn't value
I am your enemy

Fuck your world 
This is not the time I have to die.
From the wires of your cobweb.
I walk towards the light.

How much more can I take 
before my will breaks?
