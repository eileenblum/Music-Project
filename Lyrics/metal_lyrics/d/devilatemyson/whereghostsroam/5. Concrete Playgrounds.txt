In these veins my blood keeps circulating
Until the last exhausted heartbeat 
Catapults me into the unknown mystery
In you I found salvation
Another day offers old memories
Of 19 years existence
The unique moment of being your tool
It was the first time I felt naked
It was the first time I was - I
Unleashed from those shackles of
Performance
This one minute rest is my 
Conquest 
On the broken back of millions
We evolve this high tech progress
It's corded pillars will decay
In the gutters of their self detest
workers in the killing fields of Hope
miles away from concrete playgrounds
away from artificial life
I try to become the man I ever was....
