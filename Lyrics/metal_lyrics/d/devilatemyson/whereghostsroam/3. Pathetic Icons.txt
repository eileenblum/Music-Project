the goat's whisper in wires is heard by the neglected
Hitler's snakes are gathering in the flat rate society
that global networks provide. 
from ashes risen into the online
does security exists where parents fail?
does security exists where parents fail?
acknowledgement is given by coloured shadows
their words are pistols in our children's hands
my daughter smile is a masked time bomb 
god our lives seem so pathetic 
every embrace feels so sterile..
ired childhood -pc combats for (supremacy)
specific mis-education to suggest 
warmth to career replacements 
microsoft dependency  
desktop identity 
observed by liberty
at least betrayed by a backdoor tragedy
and still they ride the data dragon   
and still education lies in the bossom of 
the fucking kkk
