This night had killed the sun out of her life
and left a torn shade in its gloom
all leaves had fallen in early months
leaving her naked with those wounds
her skin is beautiful make-up
her skin is beautiful make-up
this face is stone and fists are devastating
this face is stone and fists are devastating
ten razors cut too deep into her flash
this time they reached the blossom
into the unknown with your enemy at your side
what will your worst nightmare be like
more than once had she forgiven
more than once had she been betrayed
where angels kill their saints
