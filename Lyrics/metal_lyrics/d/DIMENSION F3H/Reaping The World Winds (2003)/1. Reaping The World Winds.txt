Now enter, be welcomed I cherish your presence.
Come join the masquerade. Supersonic waves of ectasy
For I reap the world winds. I shall inflict you pain.
I reap the world winds. Come forth I call you now

I am a dragon, hidden behind a lion.
I am the shadow, kissing your flesh with whips and chains

Now listen ye all depraved. Slaves of sin and lust.
Come feel the comfort Of Fraulein Helga's house of horrors.
For I reap the world winds. I shall inflict you pain.
I reap the world winds. Come forth I call you now

I am a dragon, hidden behind a lion.
I am the shadow, kissing your flesh with whips and chains

Come ecstasy... Take my hand  You'll forever be with me...
I am the dragon, I am the lion, I am the shadow, cold like iron
I summon thee, my winds The gathering of storms Upon me...
I am the harvester of pain.

I am a dragon, hidden behind a lion
I am the shadow, kissing your flesh with whips and chains

So enter, be welcomed I cherish your presence
Come join the masquerad. Supersonic waves of ectasy
For I reap the world winds. I shall inflict you pain.
I reap the world winds. Come forth I call you now

I am a dragon, hidden behind a lion.
I am a tiger, crouching behind a gentle smile...
