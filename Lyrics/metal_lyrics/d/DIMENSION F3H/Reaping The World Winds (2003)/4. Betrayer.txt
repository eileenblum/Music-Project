In a room without light
I sense my horrors creeping up on me
Stray images scars me

In a room without light
My reality feels so unreal
Imagination betray my common sense
In a room without light
I battle everyday
Exposed and vulnerable
To the never ending waves of dark thoughts that haunts my mind

Seeking the future
In a war against my past with every heartbeat
I push the past away, Striding forward
As the only memories I desire
Is the memories of the future...

In a room without light
My future became unreality
And beauty became a spawn of betrayal
And I return to a room without light
Exposed and vulnerable
to the never ending waves of dark thoughts that haunts my mind

Within my shell I raise and stand
Listening to the echoes of your fall
Your sweet voice in my head resounding
With the lies you served one by one
And for this you became my betrayer...
And I hate you...
