Please help me now as I am falling
I've lost the sense of what is real
Transparent, yes Illusive
In a dreamlike state of mind

Please help now as I have fallen
I'm loosing sense of who I am
Erase and rewind
Play the tape all over again

I'm lying in a pool of my own dirt
Trying to understand
Understand why all this shit
Is falling down on me
Again and again and over and over
And on and on

Why is this happening to me
I am in pain
Gently falling
The rain that falls from my eyes
As I sought the wind
I now harvest
I harvest the storm

Please help now as I have fallen
I'm loosing sense of who I am
Erase and rewind
Play the tape all over again
