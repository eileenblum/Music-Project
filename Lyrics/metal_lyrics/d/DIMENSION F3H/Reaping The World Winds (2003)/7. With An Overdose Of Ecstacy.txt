I am the soul fallen from the sky
A lonely soul with hatred in his heart
My gentle smile is caressing you
Can you see the truth shining through

Illusive
So Illusive
Illusive before you I stand

Can you feel my heart beating
To the sounds of despair
The fate I am facing
Is whispered in the air

The sands of time collapse
In a desert of eternity
A galaxy of dreams
As the winds of sorrow sweep across the night
And lay to sleep at the brink of dawn
Can you feel my breath chilling
Trembling in the air
The fate I am facing
Is a whisper of my fear

Flying on the wings of sleep
I am travelling in a dream so deep
In visions of grandure
Till I touch the moon

On the soil of mother earth
I see the coming of another past
The present is futile
And the future is all

Can you feel my blood flowing
My heat upon your skin
The fate I am facing
Is a whisper of my fear

Exit devotion
Enter lies, and deceit
Playful minds for me to reap
With an overdose of ecstasy
Sleep
Enter dreams, a vision seek
Travel through the night so bleak
With an overdose of ecstasy I succeed
Ecstasy
Exit devotion
Enter lies, and deceit
Playful minds for me to reap
With an overdose of ecstasy
Sleep
Enter dreams, a vision seek
Travel through the night so bleak
With an overdose of ecstasy

These days are full of tragedies
A life that couldn't be
The dead born sound
Is A whisper in the air
