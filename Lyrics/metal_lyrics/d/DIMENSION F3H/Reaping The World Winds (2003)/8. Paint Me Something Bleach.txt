Come, walk with me
I'll take you away
Through the gates of reality
The rising sun we cannot see
It's killing me
Fly with me
On the wings of fantasy

As we roam the pale earth
In a neverending search
Life begins and ends a thousand times

Feeds my hunger
Ease my torments
My yearn for flesh.
Paint me something bleach

Come, walk with me
I'll take you away
Through the gates of reality
