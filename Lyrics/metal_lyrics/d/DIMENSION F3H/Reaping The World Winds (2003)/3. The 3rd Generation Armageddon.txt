We walk the earth with grim faces
Leaving memories, the dust beneath our boots
The sun rising, is but a pale...
A pale shadow of what it used to be

We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
Like ghosts we move
We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
We're doomed to hell

We walk on soil, forgotten by men
In a shadow of pale moonlight.
Our hearts are black
We have no hope, in a world that dies
We hear it's cries

We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
Like ghosts we move
We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
We're doomed to hell

We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
Like ghosts we move
Lost souls in a choir of sorrow
Dancing to a mournful symphony
In a world that lives no more

We walk the earth with grim faces
Leaving memories, the dust beneath our boots
Our heart's extinct, we embrace no faith
No faith, no hope, there's no reality.
We are the 3rd Generation Armageddon
