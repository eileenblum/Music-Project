Sparkling shadows all around
In my soul that whispering sound
Bring back my glamour, once so proud
Forgotten in a sleeping shape
A bleeding mind, so sad above
Despise the life and rule my fate
I'd rather die, than feel that hating love

An angel, drowned in shadows pale
A rotten sculpture a forgotten tale 

A fire, that flickered in that heart
Got torn by dreams so far apart.
Caress me into that burning sleep
With broken wings and mortal vain
I have that poison secret
Will fly away and disappear in pain
Abused flesh and betrayed mind
For the one who was too blind
Try to escape but too late
Memories of a divided heart

An angel, drowned in shadows pale
A rotten sculpture a forgotten tale

Who I think I am, is that really who I am?
A million questions travel through my mind
The cryptic writings on the wall
In un-comprehensive shapes
Like a small player
In the greatest of games I stand

Sparkling shadows all around
In my soul that whispering sound
Bring back my glamour, once so proud
Forgotten in a sleeping shape
A bleeding mind, so sad above
Despise the life and rule my fate
I'd rather die, than feel that hating love
In this mirror, all I see
A fading image that isn't me
Am I a master of my will?
Or nothing but a puppet on a tiny string
