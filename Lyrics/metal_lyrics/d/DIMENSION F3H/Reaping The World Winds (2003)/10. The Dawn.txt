The dawn, what of the dawn
We have come to kill, by sun or by moon
Escalating from the darkest pits of hell
And gather strength where the fire's dwell

Behold, the black horseman
On his winged steed
The prince of darkness soaring high
Behold the black horseman
On his winged steed
A pitch black shadow
Against a pale white moon

The dawn, what of the dawn
We seek the comfort of the dark
The plains of battle before us lay
You will never see another day
Never Never again

The dawn, what of the dawn
We've come to kill, by sun or by moon
The dawn that you seek will fade
Can't you see this is the end
The rain of terror will fall upon thee
His voice will shatter even the bravest of hearts
When you fall to the ground in tears
Behold his glory as you die

The dawn, what of the dawn
We have come to kill, by sun or by moon
Escalating from the darkest pits of hell
And gather strength where the fire's dwell

Our army before you will mesmerize you
Violence to the art
All life is forsaken
The dark has awoken
The fire that burns in our hearts
We are the glorious
Mighty warriors come to call your doom
This night we'll be victorious

The dawn, what of the dawn
We've come to kill, by sun or by moon
The dawn that you seek will fade
Can't you see this is the end 
The rain of terror will fall upon thee
His voice will shatter even the bravest of hearts
When you fall to the ground in tears
Behold his glory as you die.

And as the sun is fading high above the battlefields
Never to be seen again
At last the fallen angel has the world within his grasp
And none of you will ever see another dawn
