How does it feel, to be flying
How does it feel, to be flying
The ancient halls, the great dimension 6

Electric Shockwaves running through me, primal to the core
Have you ever tasted the sweetness of the dying
The sweetness of the dying, upon thee
Anticipation
In this world of fallen I'm seeking you
In this world so full of fallen I'm echoing your calls

I am the one, untouched by time
I am the shadow, that clouds your mind
I am the dreams that failed
I am the night watchman
I am the prince of the dark
I am the one with the answers, Who come as you die

Inside these halls where stones are talking
You shall be set free
Forever you shall wander eternity with me
Behold the ancient splendours, the gates of hell we'll reach
Let me take you to the borders of dream
The liberation
In this world of fallen I am seeking you
In this world so full of fallen I'm echoing your calls

In the halls of dream, nothing seems unreal
Fantasy explored
Yes this world of dream
Feeds your fantasy Imagination
You see In a tiny second you'll have clarity
In this world of fallen I am seeking you
In this world so full of fallen I'm echoing your calls
In this world of fallen I am seeking you
In this world so full of fallen I'm echoing your calls
