Edward kirÃ¡ly, angol kirÃ¡ly
LÃ©ptet fakÃ³ lovÃ¡n:
Hadd lÃ¡tom, Ãºgymond, mennyit Ã©r
A velszi tartomÃ¡ny.
Van-e ott folyÃ³ Ã©s fÃ¶ldje jÃ³?
LegelÅin fÅ± kÃ¶vÃ©r?
HasznÃ¡lt-e a megÃ¶ntÃ¶zÃ©s:
A pÃ¡rtos honfivÃ©r?
S a nÃ©p, az istenadta nÃ©p,
Ha oly boldog-e rajt'
Mint akarom, s mint a barom,
Melyet igÃ¡ba hajt?
FelsÃ©g! valÃ³ban koronÃ¡d
Legszebb gyÃ©mÃ¡ntja Velsz:
FÃ¶ldet, folyÃ³t, legelni jÃ³t,
Hegy-vÃ¶lgyet benne lelsz.
S a nÃ©p, az istenadta nÃ©p
Oly boldog rajta, Sire!
KunyhÃ³i mind hallgatva, mint
Megannyi puszta sir.
Edward kirÃ¡ly, angol kirÃ¡ly
LÃ©ptet fakÃ³ lovÃ¡n:
KÃ¶rÃ¶tte csend amerre ment,
Ãs nÃ©ma tartomÃ¡ny.
Montgomery a vÃ¡r neve,
Hol aznap este szÃ¡llt;
Montgomery, a vÃ¡r ura,
VendÃ©gli a kirÃ¡lyt.
Vadat Ã©s halat, s mi jÃ³ falat
Szem-szÃ¡jnak ingere,
SÃ¼rgÅ csoport, szÃ¡z szolga hord,
Hogy nÃ©zni is tereh;
S mind, amiket e szÃ©p sziget
Ãtelt-italt terem;
S mind, ami bor pezsegve forr
TÃºl messzi tengeren.
Ti urak, ti urak! hÃ¡t senkisem
Koccint Ã©rtem pohÃ¡rt?
Ti urak, ti urak!... ti velsz ebek!
Ne Ã©ljen EduÃ¡rd?
Vadat Ã©s halat, s mi az Ã©g alatt
Szem-szÃ¡jnak kellemes,
Azt lÃ¡tok Ã©n: de Ã¶rdÃ¶g itt
BelÃ¼l minden nemes.
Ti urak, ti urak, hitvÃ¡ny ebek!
Ne Ã©ljen EduÃ¡rd?
Hol van, ki zengje tetteim -
ElÅ egy velszi bÃ¡rd!

[English translation:]

The Bards of Wales

Edward the king, the English king,
Bestrides his tawny steed,
"For I will see if Wales," said he,
"Accepts my rule indeed.

"Are stream and mountain fair to see?
Are meadow grasses good?
Do corn-lands bear a crop more rare
Since wash'd with rebel's blood?

"And are the wretched people there,
Whose insolence I broke
As happy as the oxen are
Beneath the driver's yoke?

"In truth this Wales, Sire, is a gem,
The fairest in your crown:
The stream and field rich harvest yield,
And fair and dale and down.

"And all the wretched people there
Are calm as man could crave;
Their hovels stand throughout the land
As silent as the grave."

Edward the king, the English King
Bestrides his tawny steed;
A silence deep his subjects keep
And Wales is mute indeed.

The castle named Montgomery
Ends that day's journeying;
The castle's lord, Montgomery,
Must entertain the king.

Then game and fish and ev'ry dish
That lures the taste and sight
A hundred hurrying servants bear
To please the appetite.

With all of worth the isle brings forth
In dainty drink and food,
And all the wines of foreign vines
Beyond the distant flood.

"You lords, you lords, will none consent
His glass with mine to ring?
What? Each one fails, you dogs of Wales,
To toast the English king?

"Though game and fish and ev'ry dish
That lures the taste and sight
Your hand supplies, your mood defies
My person with a slight.

"You rascal lords, you dogs of Wales,
Will none for Edward cheer?
To serve my needs and chant my deeds
Then let a bard appear!"
