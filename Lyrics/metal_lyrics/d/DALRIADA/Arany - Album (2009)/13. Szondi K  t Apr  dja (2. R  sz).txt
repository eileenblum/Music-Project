Hadd zÃºgjon az Ã¡lgyu! pogÃ¡ny Ali mond,
Pattog a bomba, Ã©s rÃ¶pked a grÃ¡nÃ¡t;
Minden tÃ¼zes Ã¶rdÃ¶g nÃ©pet, falat ont:
TÃ¶ri DrÃ©gel sziklai vÃ¡rÃ¡t.

"SzÃ©p Ãºrfiak! a nap nyugvÃ³ra hajolt,
ImmÃ¡r fÃ¶di vÃ¡llÃ¡t bÃ­borszinÃ¼ kaftÃ¡n,
SzÃ©l zendÃ¼l az erdÅn, - leskel a hold:
Idekinn hideg Ã©j sziszeg aztÃ¡n!"

A vÃ¡r piacÃ¡ra ezÃ¼stÃ¶t, aranyt,
Sok nagybecsÃ¼ marhÃ¡t mÃ¡glyÃ¡ba kihordat;
Harcos paripÃ¡i nyihognak alant:
SzÃ¼gyeikben tÅrt keze forgat.

"AztÃ¡n - no, hisz Ãºgy volt! aztÃ¡n elesett!
ZÃ¡szlÃ³s kopiÃ¡val hÅs Ali temette;
Itt nyugszik a halmon, - rÃ¶vid az eset -;
ZengjÃ©tek Alit ma helyette!"

KÃ©t dalnoka is volt, kÃ©t Ã¡rva fiÃº:
ÃltÃ¶zteti cifrÃ¡n bÃ¡rsonyba puhÃ¡ba:
Nem hagyta cselÃ©dit - ezÃ©rt Ã¶li bÃº -
Vele halni meg, Ã³cska ruhÃ¡ba'!

"S kÃ¼ldÃ¶tt Alihoz... Ali dÃºs, Ali jÃ³;
LÃ¡ny-arcotok' a nap meg nem sÃ¼ti nÃ¡la;
SÃ¡trÃ¡ban alusztok, a szÃ©ltÃ¼l is Ã³:
Fiaim, hozzÃ¡ kÃ¶t a hÃ¡la!"

Hogy vÃ­tt ezerekkel! hogy vÃ­tt egyedÅ±l!
Mint bÃ¡stya, feszÃ¼lt meg romlott torony aljÃ¡n:
JÃ³ kardja elÅtt a had rendre ledÅ±l,
KelevÃ©ze ragyog vala baljÃ¡n.

"Rusztem maga volt Å!... s hogy harcola mÃ©g,
BÃ¡r Ã¡lgyugolyÃ³tul megtÃ¶rt ina, tÃ©rde!
Ãn lÃ¡ttam e harcot!... Azonban elÃ©g:
Ali majd haragunni fog Ã©rte."

Mint hulla a hulla! veszett a pogÃ¡ny,
KÅ mÃ³dra befolyvÃ¡n a hegy menedÃ©kÃ©t:
Å Ã¡lla halÃ¡la vÃ©rmosta fokÃ¡n,
Diadallal vÃ¡rta be vÃ©gÃ©t.

"VÃ©ge mikor lesz? kifogytok-e mÃ¡r
DÃ­csÃ©retibÅl az otromba gyaurnak?
Eb a hite kÃ¶lykei! vesszeje vÃ¡r
Ãs bÃ¶rtÃ¶ne kÃ©sz Ali Ãºrnak."

Apadjon el a szem, mely cÃ©lba vevÃ©,
SzÃ¡radjon el a kar, mely Åt lefejezte;
Irgalmad, oh Isten, ne lÃ©gyen Ã¶vÃ©,
Ki miatt lÅn ily kora veszte!

The Two Pages Of Szondi (Part 2)

"`Let the canons roar, then!' heathen Ali speaks;
bombs shower on Dregel, hailstorming grenades fall -
hell's fiery legions rise to scale the peaks
hammering at the fortress' stone wall."

"Gentlemen handsome, the sun's gone to sleep,
over its shoulders are red robes of a kaftan;
wind strikes up the wood-stems, moon spies through the deep,
chilly night swishes o'er the dead captain."

"On the fortress' square all the silver and gold
Szondi has them build a treasure-pyre mighty;
with dagger in hand he must, fearless and bold,
put to death every whinnying palfrey."

"Well then, what of it now, so good Szondi fell.
...Ali acted nobly... Gave him a hero's rest.
He rests on the hilltop - this is what befell -
Start singing of Ali! Give him your songs' very best!"

"Well... he had two minstrels, a pair of orphaned boys,
clad them in the best clothes, velvety and soft-hued,
he would not allow them to die in garments soiled
so they mourn ... feeling sad, over-valued."

"He sent us to Ali... `Ali's lavish, Ali's good,
harsh sun will not darken your fair faces with him -
you'll sleep in his tent - there's no wind, but good food,
come on boys, pay your accolades to him!"'

"Szondi fought with thousands! Alone, he, and in vain!
Holding off the ruin with his own back merely -
armies fell in droves by his mighty sword slain
in his left hand his hauberk shone fiercely..."

"True... He fought like Rustem' - it can't be denied -
though his knees and sinews by our guns were broken,
true... I saw the fight... But stop! Ali will chide,
and his wrath must not vainly be woken!"

"Like crops fell the corpses, the Turks fell or fled,
littering the valley like landfill all gory.
He stood on the blood-soaked peak of his death
and awaited his own end with glory."

"Well, when will you stop? Won't you come to an end
whimpering the praises of your clumsy leader?
To hell with you bastards! To our whip you will bend
and you'll languish in Lord Ali's slammer!"

Let his eyes run dry that butchered such a lord
wither, O God, the arms that halted Szondi's darting,
spare mercy, O God, on none who could afford
be the cause of his early departing.

[Translated by Makkai ÃdÃ¡m]

[The Siege of DrÃ©gely began on 6 July 1552 when an Ottoman army of 12,000
men led by Hadim Ali Pasha arrived at the gates of DrÃ©gely Castle. In that
afternoon the first wave of Turkish cannon fire brought down the decayed
castle walls and the Janissaries captured the lower castle courtyard
without a fight. The next morning the Turks attacked but were defeated by
Szondy and his infantrymen, the HajdÃºs. Despite outnumbering them by 12 to
1, the Janissaries were defeated by Szondy's 100 HajdÃºs. After
acknowledging the bravery of his opponent Ali Pasha decided to launch a
full scale cannonade the next day. The walls were destroyed by noon on 8
July.

On 9 July 1552 Ali Pasha prayed to Allah in the early morning and
requested victory. He decided to send the local Catholic priest to Szondy
and offer him a choice: either to surrender and be given safe passage and
escort to Upper Hungary, or to perish. Szondy sent his scribe and servant
with his answer to Ali Pasha saying "Spare the boys and let God settle the
fate of this castle". In the afternoon the Janissaries attacked and Szondy
ordered the last cannonade to be fired and ordered a full scale attack
against the Turks. Four hours of intensive fighting ensued until Szondy's
forces were reduced to sixty men. Szondy led the attack and was shot
through the knee and fought even on his knees until he was brought down by
the Turks.]
