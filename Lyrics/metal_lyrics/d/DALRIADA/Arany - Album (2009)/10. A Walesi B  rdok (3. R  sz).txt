Ha, ha! mi zÃºg?... mi Ã©ji dal
London utcÃ¡in ez?
FelkÃ¶ttetem a lord-majort,
Ha bosszant bÃ¡rmi nesz!
Ãll nÃ©ma csend; lÃ©gy szÃ¡rnya bent,
Se kÃ¼nn, nem hallatik:
"FejÃ©re szÃ³l, ki szÃ³t emel!
KirÃ¡ly nem alhatik."
Ha, ha! elÅ sÃ­p, dob, zene!
Harsogjon harsona:
FÃ¼lembe zÃºgja Ã¡tkait
A velszi lakoma...
De tÃºl zenÃ©n, tÃºl sÃ­p-dobon,
RiadÃ³ kÃ¼rtÃ¶n Ã¡t:
ÃtszÃ¡z Ã©nekli hangosan
A vÃ©rtanÃºk dalÃ¡t.

[English translation]

The Bards of Wales (continue)

"'Ods blood! What songs this night resound
Upon our London streets?
The mayor shall feel my irate heel
If aught that sound repeats!

Each voice is hush'd; through silent lanes
To silent homes they creep.
"Now dies the hound that makes a sound;
The sick king cannot sleep."

"Ha! Bring me fife and drum and horn,
And let the trumpet blare!
In ceaseless hum their curses come -
I see their dead eyes glare..."

But high above all drum and fife
and trumpets' shrill debate,
Five hundred martyr'd voices chant
Their hymn of deathless hate.

[Translation by Watson Kirkconnell]

[Although doubted by scholars, it is strongly held in the oral tradition that King Edward I of England had five hundred bards executed after his conquest of Wales in 1277, lest they incite the Welsh youth to rebellion by reminding them in their songs of their nation's glorious past.
Notes of Janos Arany]

[Arany wrote this poem when the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph first visited Hungary after he defeated it in its 1848-49 War of Independence. Originally he was asked to write a poem to praise the Emperor.]
