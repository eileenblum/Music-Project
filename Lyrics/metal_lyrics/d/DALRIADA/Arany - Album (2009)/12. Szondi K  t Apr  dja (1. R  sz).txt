FelhÅbe hanyatlott a drÃ©geli rom,
RÃ¡ visszasÃ¼t a nap, Ã¡dÃ¡z tusa napja;
SzemkÃ¶zt vele nyÃ¡jas, szÃ©p zÃ¶ld hegy-orom,
TetejÃ©n lobogÃ³s hadi kopja.

KÃ©t ifiu tÃ©rdel, kezÃ¶kben a lant,
A kopja tÃ¶vÃ©n, mintha volna feszÅ±let.
Zsibongva hadÃ¡val a vÃ¶lgyben alant
Ali gyÅzelem-Ã¼nnepet Å±let.

"MÃ©rt nem jÃ¶n a Szondi kÃ©t dalnoka, mÃ©rt?
BÃ¼lbÃ¼l-szavu rÃ³zsÃ¡k kÃ©t mennyei bokra?
Hadd fÅ±zne dalokbÃ³l gyÃ¶ngysorba fÃ¼zÃ©rt,
OdaillÅt egy huri nyakra!"

"Ott zÃ¶ldel az ormÃ³, fenn zÃ¶ldel a hant
ZÃ¡szlÃ³s kopiÃ¡val a gyaur basa sÃ­rjÃ¡n:
Ott tÃ©rdel a gyÃ¶ngypÃ¡r, kezÃ©ben a lant,
Ãs pengeti, pengeti, sÃ­rvÃ¡n:"

...S hogy feljÃ¶ve MÃ¡rton, az oroszi pap,
KevÃ©ly Ã¼zenettel a bÅsz Ali kÃ¼ldte:
Add meg kegyelemre, jÃ³ Szondi, magad!
Meg nem marad itt anyaszÃ¼lte.

"Serbet, fÃ¼ge, pÃ¡lma, sok dÃ©li gyÃ¼mÃ¶lcs,
Mit csak terem a nagy szultÃ¡n birodalma,
JÃ³ illatu fÅ±szer, Ã©s drÃ¡ga kenÅcs...
Ali gyÅzelem-Ã¼nnepe van ma!"

Mondjad neki, MÃ¡rton, im ezt felelem:
Kegyelmet uradtÃ³l nem vÃ¡r soha Szondi,
JÃ©zusa kezÃ©ben kÃ©sz a kegyelem:
Egyenest oda fog folyamodni.

The Two Pages Of Szondi (Part 1)

The ruins of Dregel have sunk in the clouds
The setting sun peers back, fight-worn is its red gaze,
opposite, a gentle green-grassed hill of mounds
with a spear and a flag that the wind frays.

Two youths are kneeling with lutes in their hands
- looks as if there were a cross struck to the spear's stem -
with victory shouts proud Ali cheers his bands
and he dances and praises and feasts them.

"Szondi's two pages, why do they not come?
Rose-bushes with angels' voice - they rhyme no fury -
let them weave a wreath of songs here to become
the bejewelled neck of a Houri."

"See there, on the hill-top, next to the green mound
the infidel captain's spear and flag they're guarding -
there kneels your precious pair - and sweet is the sound
of their lutes which they pluck with eyes smarting."

"Then Marton, the priest of Nagyoroszi climbed up,
sent by Ali's haughty message as befriender:
`Look, good Captain Szondi, you might as well give up;
woman-born, you all die or surrender."'

("Handsome troubadours, on this sad, barren mound
by this cross and spear you've lost reason for chanting -
come with me, where's dancing, honey, merry sound;
you'll be dined there with sherbet and dancing.")

"Palm-buds, figs and sherbet, all the south's rich fruit
all that grows and ripens in lands of the Sultan -
sweetly scented spices, balm, fragrance acute,
come on! Join Ali's feast, quit the sulking!"

"`Go good father Marton, this is my response:
Szondi never wanted mercy from your master -
from the hands of Jesus flow true mercy's fonts;
it's to Him I commend the disaster!' "
