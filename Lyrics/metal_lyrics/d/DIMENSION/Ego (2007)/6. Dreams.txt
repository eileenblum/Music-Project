[Lyrics - Music: DAVID QUICHO]

FOOTSTEPS ON THE WATER
TRACKS OVER THE SEA
WALKING JUST BEHIND YOU
SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE

LEAD ME THROUGH THE SHADOWS
TAKE AWAY MY FEAR
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND YOU
TELL ME HOW TO DREAM

IM WALKING ON THE SEA
IM LEARNING HOW TO LIVE
I JUST WANT TO BE FREE
FREE TO DREAM

FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS
KEY THAT OPEN DREAMS
LET THE FLOOD SORROUNDS YOU
LOCKING ALL THE FEARS

STANDING IN THE SHADOWS
CATCHING ALL YOUR DREAMS
WALKING ON THE WATER
BECOMES REALITY

PRESENT LIFE IS A DREAM
I WILL BE WAITING HERE FOR TOMORROW
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOUR LIFE IS THE DREAM THAT I FOLLOW

IM WALKING ON THE SEA
IM LEARNING HOW TO LIVE
I JUST WANT TO BE FREE
FREE TO DREAM

PRESENT LIFE IS A DREAM
I WILL BE WAITING HERE FOR TOMORROW
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOUR LIFE IS THE DREAM THAT I FOLLOW
