[Lyrics: DAVID QUICHO - Music: MANE CABRALES]

THERE IS SOMETHING THAT AWAKES ME BY NIGHT
IS THE WIND BLOWING, WAVING YOUR FLAG

YOUR STARS ARE SHOWING THE THOUGHTS OF YOUR MIND
LIGHTING THE WINDOWS OF FREEDOM LAND

THE WALL IS BUILT BY YOUR STARS AND YOUR STRIPES
AND THE TARGET OF YOUR GUNS ARE THE REBEL MINDS

PREACHERS AND PRIESTS NOW ARE GUIDING YOUR SHEEP
IN GOD WE TRUST IS THE BELIEVERS DREAM

IN HIS MINDLESS WAY
THE MAN WALKED TO NOWHERE
LOST THE DAY
FREEDOM LAND NEVER ENDS

LEADING YOUR CHILDREN JUSTIFIED BY GRACE
CORRUPTING AND BLINDING ALL OVER THE MASS
THEY TRUST IN THE MEDIA BLIND GUIDES OF TODAY
THEIR TONGUES SPITING FIRE WE ARE BURNING IN HELL

IN HIS MINDLESS WAY
THE MAN WALKED TO NOWHERE
LOST THE DAY
FREEDOM LAND NEVER ENDS
