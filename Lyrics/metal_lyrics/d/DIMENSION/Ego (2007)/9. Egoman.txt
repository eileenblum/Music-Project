[Lyrics: DAVID QUICHO / Music: MANE CABRALES]

I AM THE SEED OF THOUSAND TIMES
THOUSAND THOUGHTS AND THOUSAND CRIES

I JUST CAME HERE MAYBE BY CHANCE
MAYBE BY LOVE, MAYBE IS A TRAP

BURNING INSIDE ME, CHASED BY MY PAST
A MILLION AGES, CROWN HUMAN PRIDE

I AM THE MAN
I AM THE EGO, RAISING MY FALL
THE BEGINNING OF THE END, EGOMAN

BEGAN A JOURNEY THAT NEVER ENDS
THAT NEVER STOPS, THEREâS NO REGRET

ASKING ME SOMETIMES THE WHERE I GO
THE WHO AM I, A HUNDRED LIES

BURNING INSIDE ME, CHASED BY MY PAST
A MILLION AGES, CROWN HUMAN PRIDE

I AM THE MAN
I AM THE EGO, RAISING MY FALL
THE BEGINNING OF THE END, EGOMAN
