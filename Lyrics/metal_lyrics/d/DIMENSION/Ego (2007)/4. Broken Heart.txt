[Lyrics: DAVID QUICHO - Music: MANE CABRALES]

LIKE A WIDOW BROKEN WITH GRIEF
SHE WAS WAITING IN HER MOURNING
SHE ONCE BEAUTY QUEEN OF NATIONS
LOST THE BATTLE AND IS NOW SLAVE

IN THE CITY REIGNS THE SILENCE
THEY HAVE SEEN HER STRIPPED NAKED
ALL HER LOVERS NO ONE HELP HER
HER PRIEST CRYING BITTERLY SHE WEEPS

NOW MY HEART IS BROKEN
AND MY SOUL DESPAIRS
FOR I HAVE TERRIBLE REBELLED

I AM HELPLESS IN THEIR HAND
I CAN NOT ESCAPE FROM MY ENEMIES
VIRGINS HAVE BEEN DRAGGED AWAY
HER YOUNG CHILDREN TAKEN FAR AWAY

PEOPLE GROANING CRY FOR BREAD
SHE WAS THINKING PUNISHMENT IS NEAR
SHE HIDES HER FACE HUMILIATED
SHE WAS PRAYING OH! LORD SEE MY PAIN

NOW MY HEART IS BROKEN
AND MY SOUL DESPAIRS
FOR I HAVE TERRIBLE REBELLED
