[Lyrics: DAVID QUICHO / Music: MANE CABRALES]

[1 pt.- I AM]

IM THE TRACE, IM THE BLOOD, IM THE SAND
IM THE HISTORY OVER THE LAND
IM THE PROUD OF THE FUTURE AHEAD
I AM FLYING THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF MEN

I AM FIRE, IM WATER, IM WIND
I AM FEEDING YOUR HEART EVERYDAY
I AM KILLING THE THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD
I AM BUILDING THE ESSENCE OF MAN

GIVE ME LOVE, GIVE ME SOME CONFIDENCE
GIVE ME HOPE, GIVE ME CARE

IM THE TIME, IM THE TRUST, IM THE AIR
I AM STANDING BESIDE YOUR REQUEST
IM BEHIND OF YOUR BIGGEST INTENT
IM THE KEEPER OF THE SOUL OF MAN

I AM HONOR, IM GOLD, IM SUCCESS
HIDING UNDER YOUR DEEPEST PRETEXT
I AM TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR HEAD
I AM JUST WHAT I AM

SO WE BELONG TO EACH OTHER
AND EACH NEEDS ALL THE OTHERS

GIVE ME LOVE, GIVE ME CONFIDENCE
GIVE ME HOPE, GIVE ME CARE

SO WE BELONG TO EACH OTHER
AND EACH NEEDS ALL THE OTHERS

WE WERE TAKEN FROM THE DUST
AND TO DUST WE WILL RETURN
CONSEQUENCE OF PRIDE IS FALL
AND THE FALL IS BLINDING ALL

IT SEEMS STILL GOES ON AND ON
MAN IS RAISING LIKE THE SUN
ELEVATION OF THE SOUL
AND THE GAME WE PLAY IS FALL

SO WE BELONG TO EACH OTHER
AND EACH NEEDS ALL THE OTHERS

[2 pt.- MYSELF]

SO HOW CAN I STAND ALONE BY MYSELF
IF WE HAVE MANY PARTS IN THE ONE BODY

I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD
I CAN MAKE IT BY MYSELF
I HAVE BEEN MADE LIKE A GOD
WHOâS GONNA CARE WHEN I FALL?

TIME TO BE GREAT
TIME TO REGRET
TIME TO REMAIN
TIME TO REPENT

I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD
I CAN MAKE IT BY MYSELF
I HAVE BEEN MADE LIKE A GOD
WHOâS GONNA CARE WHEN I FALL?

TIME TO BE GREAT
TIME TO REGRET
TIME TO REMAIN
TIME TO REPENT

I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD
I CAN MAKE IT BY MYSELF
I HAVE BEEN MADE LIKE A GOD
WHOâS GONNA CARE WHEN I FALL?

[3 pt.- THE NEW REASON]

THE STORY IS IN THE AIR
THE MAN TRUST IN HIMSELF
WE ARE WALKING ON THE PATH
OF THE NEW REASON

MY MIND IS IN CONTROL
I LIVE IN A NEW WORLD
THE STARS ARE SHINING
IM THE SON OF GOLD

BELIEVING THAT WE CAN
WE ARE GETTING TO THE AIM
WITH DREAMS WE ARE BUILDING
THIS NEW WORLD OF EGOS

IMAGES IN THE AIR
THAT CHANGES REALITY
BEGINNING OF THIS GREAT
NEW FATE FOR WORLD

THE STARS ARE GUIDING TO MY SPIRIT
THROUGH THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD
AND I AM FALLING IN THE ESSENCE
OF THIS NEW CONTROL

EGO

LEAD ME THROUGH FIRE, BURN IN MY BRAIN
BLOWING INSIDE ME, LEAD ME THROUGH WIND
LEAD ME THROUGH WATER, RAIN OVER ME
GIVE ME A NEW BIRTH, LEAD ME THROUGH EARTH

TAKE MY BODY, TAKE MY SPIRIT
AND CONTROL THE NEW BEGINNING

SO WE BELONG TO EACH OTHER
AND EACH NEEDS ALL THE OTHERS
