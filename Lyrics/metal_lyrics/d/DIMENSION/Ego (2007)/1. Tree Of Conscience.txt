I am talking to myself
I remember how it was
Everything becomes so clear
The missing parts

We just talked about the life
Good from evil was the task
Did he tell you not to eat?
Begin the fall

I can remember well
He said that we must not
He told us not to touch
He knows that youâll be wise
Be wise, be like God

I want to be like him
I ran in to the trees
Desire is burning me
And now I see so clear
Be wise, be like God

Thatâs a lie
Serpent hissed
Youâll not die
God knows well

Tree of conscience
Knowing good from bad
Empty witness
Lead me through the land

Tree of conscience
Knowing good from bad
Conversation
Leading human race
