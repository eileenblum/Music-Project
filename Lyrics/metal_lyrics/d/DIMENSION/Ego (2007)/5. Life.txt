[Lyrics: DAVID QUICHO - Music: MANE CABRALES/EDDIE DEL PALACIO]

SINCE LONG TIME AGO
WAITING FOR THE LIGHT
DUST OF THE OLD LAND
THERE WAS THE MAN

DUST WILL BE THE MAN
TAKING BREATH OF LIFE
BE THE LIVING ONE
MAN RULES THE LAND

THE MAN BECAME GOLD
THE GOLD BECAME GOD
GOD TURNS INTO MAN
WEâLL BE THE SAME

WHISPERS IN THE AIR
TALKING TO OUR HEAD
IMAGES WE LEARN
WE LIVE WITH THEM

BUILDING THE LIFE, HIGHER THAN SKY, LIVING A LIE
BUILDING MY LIFE, HIGHER MUCH HIGH, MY TRUTH IS LIE

BUILDING THE LIFE, HIGHER THAN SKY, LIVING A LIE
BUILDING YOUR LIFE, HIGHER MUCH HIGH, YOUR TRUTH IS LIE

POURING LIKE THE RAIN
THOUGHTS OF FUTURE MAN
FALLING TO REMAIN
AS PRIDE OF MAN

TASTED BY THE LIFE
BEING THE CHOOSEN ONE
CARVING ON THE TIME
YOU ARE THE MAN

BUILDING THE LIFE, HIGHER THAN SKY, LIVING A LIE
BUILDING MY LIFE, HIGHER MUCH HIGH, MY TRUTH IS LIE

BUILDING THE LIFE, HIGHER THAN SKY, LIVING A LIE
BUILDING YOUR LIFE, HIGHER MUCH HIGH, YOUR TRUTH IS LIE
