[Lyrics: DAVIS QUICHO / Music: MANE CABRALES]

TODAY IM TURNING ON THE TV
THEY WANT TO BUY MY SOUL AGAIN
WHOâS TRYING?, WHOâS BUYING?
WHO WANTS TO BE THE NEXT IN LINE?

IM SITTING ALL ALONE BY SCREEN
THEY WANT TO TWIST MY THOUGHTS AGAIN
WHOâS LYING? WHOâS CRYING?
WHO WANTS TO BE THE ONLY ONE?

BE THE ONLY ONE, BE THE ONE FOR WAR, BE THE WAR FOR ALL

TODAY IM TURNING OFF THE TV
I WANT TO BRAKE THE CHAIN AGAIN
WHOâS FIGHTING?, DEFYING
WHO WANTS TO BE THE NEXT IN LINE?

IM TAKING OFF MY MIND FROM THE SCREEN
I WANT TO FREE MY THOUGHTS AGAIN
WHOâS DYING?, DENYING
WHO WANTS TO BE THE ONLY ONE?

ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, IN TO MY CELL
ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, PRETENDING BE FREE
ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, IN TO THE FRAME
ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, GIVE ME YOUR HAND

BE THE NEXT IN LINE
WHOâS GONNA KILL? , WHOâS GONNA WIN?
TELL ME WHOâS THE ONE FOR WAR?

BE THE ONLY ONE
WHOâS GONNA PAY? , WHO WILL BETRAY?
TELL ME WHY THEY HIDE THEIR FACE?

PRAYING TO YOUR GOD, WAITING FOR THE LIGHT
KILLING EVERYONE, WHOâS BEHIND?

WHO WANTS TO DEFY?
WHOâS GONNA TRY?, WHOâS GONNA FIGHT?
ARE YOU READY FOR THE WAR?

WHO WANTS TO DENY?
WHOâS GONNA LIE? , WHO WANTS TO DIE?
ARE YOU STANDING IN THE LINE?

ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, IN TO THE CELL
ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, PRETENDING BE FREE
ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, IN TO THE FRAME
ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, GIVE ME YOUR HAND
