[Lyrics: DAVID QUICHO - Music: MANE CABRALES/EDDIE DEL PALACIO]

THIS IS NOT A LOVELY SONG
IT'S FADING LIGHT AND COLOR
THERE IS NO RESPECT FOR YOU
NO RESPECT FOR ME

IT IS AN ANCIENT SONG
WITH A BLINDING TONE
SOMETIMES YOUâRE AFRAID OF ME
IM AFRAID OF YOU

WE ARE WALKING SIDE BY SIDE
LYING RIGHT ON TIME
AND CLIMBING TO THE SKY
FORGETTING THE PAST

IT IS A HIDE WAY
REMAINS THE SAME
YOU KNOW I WILL FORGET YOU
YOU WILL ALWAYS OH!! BE THERE

THEREâS NOT A LOVE SONG
SILENCE PREVAIL
YOU KNOW I WILL FORGET YOU
YOU WILL ALWAYS OH!! BE THERE

WE ARE WALKING SIDE BY SIDE
LYING RIGHT ON TIME
AND SINGING THE SAME RHYME
YOUâLL LOVE ME ANY TIME
