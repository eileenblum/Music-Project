[Lyrics: David Quicho]

Sometimes we miss the past
And believe we get nowhere
On occasions we jump over our obstacles
Stumbling we fall with them
As if we get to like it
But we keep traversing our destiny
Leaving behind old mistakes
Wanting to forget and looking at
The finish line
Thinking we have found
What we so dream about
Facing at the turn of time
A worn face reflected
In the mirror of time
