[Lyrics: David Quicho]

We will construct a new world
We will mold a new generation
We will plan the foundations
Of the new population
Before the new generations come
There are the present ones
Others were future ones also
But for those the past generations worked
The new old world
Modern primitive mind
Infinite transient soul
We will disguise the laws
Freedom without restraint
Limitation cannot resist
Freedom will be used without discretion
We will hire violence
Sex, religion, politics
If you want to take a look
Just turn on your monitor
The present is the futureÂ´s slave
And the past was also
Surprised they may discover
That the future will be also
