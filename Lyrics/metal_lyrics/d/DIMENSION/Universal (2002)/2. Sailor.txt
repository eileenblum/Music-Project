[Lyrics: David Quicho]

WeÂ´ve seen die the old millennium
And let History take it far away
With yearning they waited
The new millenniumÂ´s birth
And fascinated with this new era
They broke all the rules as a celebration
IÂ´m a traveler in Space and Time
IÂ´m a Sailor of the new millennium
I will wait for you
In the storm and in the silence
I will wait for the Creation from
The travel of time
And being held at the crossroad
Of this age
I let myself to be guided
By your sight till I find
Myself with you through time
Or until I break the silence
With the sound of my last breath
