[Lyrics: David Quicho]

Collective mind
That is the plan
We will globalize
The enterprise
The currency and the Creed
It will be the start
Of the Great Surprise
When they see
The leaders losing
Morals, faith and honesty
They will run to commit
What we had impressed
In their minds
You are God
You can fly
And go everywhere
You will be the prey
Of the Universal Mind
Global conscience
Animal soul
For frame by frame
To engrave
In every breath
In every thought
The Universal Mind
The new old world
Modern primitive mind
Infinite transient soul
Nuevo Orden Mundial
Slave of Freedom
That deceives you with the truth
Death of life
That stays with you in loneliness
Light of the dark
That guides you to nowhere
Endless end
Transforming itself without change
You are God
You can fly
And go everywhere
You will be the prey
Of the Universal Mind
Avoided knowledge
Teaching you without words
Loving hatred
Executes you without killing you
Pacific violence
Without seeing watching over you
Lost fundament
Without our Universal Mind
