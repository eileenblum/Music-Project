[Lyrics: David Quicho]

Generations come, generations go
The sun goes up and down again
My eyes are not tired of seeing
Neither my ears to hear
What it was, that will be
What was done, it will be done
ThereÂ´s no memory of those who are gone
Neither of those who will come
The twisted cannot be straightened
What is missing cannot be counted
Where wisdom flows, sorrow grows
If you gather science, pain is increased
Pleasure is vanity
And laughter is madness
The wise man has eyes on his forehead
And the blind in ignorance will live
And to my soul I ask
If it can the wind catch
