[Lyrics: David Quicho]

Welcome to the new game
We will play the game of sleep
Which is playing not to know
Bewitchment when you live
Always celebrating
Always teching you to forget
It will be like a spell
Not to wake up ever more
Submission, Inoculation
Education, Domestication
All you have
There is no more
Just forget
Not remember
Wake up you who sleep
Someone is knocking at your doors
Wake up
Like a game slowly
Disconnect our minds
And steal away our innocence
For if you play to think
The spell will break
