[Lyrics: David Quicho]

Tell me what is fate
Remind me if it guides me
Do you think I am afraid?
Do you believe I am afraid?
Have you thought
That all was planned?
The color of your eyes
The color of your skin
Have you ever fought
To break the spell?
I am standing in the breach
I will keep making a trench
Do you think I am afraid?
Tell me what is destiny
Remind me if it guides me
Do you think that I have a destiny?
Have you ever thought that you have fate?
Have you ever fought to change your way?
Have you ever killed just to fulfill the fate?
