[Lyrics: David Quicho]

I have been riding
The valley is dark
Deep in the fog
I could not find you
I am so tired
I cannot go on
I feel confusion
I could not see you
I am the wind that opens up your mind
I am the noise that wakes the sleeping crowd
The Dimension that makes the subconscious free
Pain will run away
From your heartÂ´s moan
I have awakened
From the dream I suffered
I have found you
My grief is gone
