Civilization, The west is the goal
We sale ideas, Homogenization
Bring down religion and bring down the wall
The new world will arise after a while

Communication, Is the sweet control
We got the weapons for globalization
Forget your doctrines and forget your god's
The new day soon will shine with peace and calm

Death, Sharp pale horse on earth
Wrath, Killing a fourth of them

Riding the wings of plague
War and bloodshed
Visions of a pale tale
Crushing the mind and soul of man

Eradication, May not be for all
Take down the rebels with annihilation
Erase ideals and erase them thoughts
The new man will arise after a while

Emancipation, They're stealing it all
We got the power for colonization
Brand new religion and now you're reborn
The new world's settle down for all mankind

Death, Sharp pale horse on earth
Wrath, Killing a fourth of them

Riding the wings of plague
War and bloodshed
Visions of a pale tale
Crushing the mind and soul of man
