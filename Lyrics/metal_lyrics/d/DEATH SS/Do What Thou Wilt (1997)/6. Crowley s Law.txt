He was called the wickedest man in the world
the Great Beast of Hell incarned on earth.
He spent all his life studying ancient cults
and cursing the God in whose faith he was born

Unrecognized genius for th rebel youth
the poet of all men who desire to be free
He shocked the world with his depraved life
but showed everyone the way to the light.

Love is the law, love under will
Thou hast no right but to do thy will.
Do that and no other shall say nay.

Hark! This is Crowley's law!
The light beyond the door.
There is no grace, no guilt,
you must do what thou wilt!

He taught us freedom, true love and will
to make all people aware of truth.
He stirred men's conscience with sex and joy
against the constraints of crapolous creeds.

He received the law and the joy of the world
and came into contact with the forces of Hell.
He made of the knowledge his reason of life
and laid out the road for the spiritual might.

Hark! This is Crowley's law!
The light beyond the door.
There is no grace, no guilt,
you must do what thou wilt!
