Scarlet woman your eyes are in the mirror
where all vices of men can reflect down on Earth.
Scarlet as all the flames born in springtime,
as the female substance of your name: BABALON!

Your soul is red as blood by moonlight
your womb gives to unholy ghosts.
Your lotus provides us with the Elisir.

You're the sweet-smelling lady of darkness
and receive the Sun's strenght through the red doors of lust.
Like a Phoenix reborn from the ashes
you scan time to prepare for the advent of the Beast.

I drink your nectar filled with magic
'cause I will change it into life.
Your sex to me is the source of every will.

Ride the Beast, sweet whore of Hell
and turn my pain into Heaven.
Suck my blood and tear my soul.
Let the night set ablaze our love!

You're the adulteressm the lady of changes,
you're the virgin, the mother, the lady of spell.
Oh my magical, mystical woman
give me victory and life with your juice of the moon.

I drink your nectar filled with magic
'cause I will change it into life. 
Your sex to me is the source of every will.

Ride the Beast, sweet whore of Hell
and turn my pain into Heaven.
Suck my blood and tear my soul.
Let the night set ablaze our love!
