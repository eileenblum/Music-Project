Lead my wandering soul through the dark roads of Amenti
I will follow the Great Light, your thin body full of might.
Join my hands and rise, from the darkness of the other side
I will take you as my bride, between the stars of the Cycle of life.

I'm the Serpent Rainbow, wrapped in the coils
In my grip there's always joy,
with my poison I fill the void.

Take the ritual knife and shed my blood into emptiness
so that it defines for all
where the Tree of Life will fall - where we will fall!

I will kiss the black vessel of  the Great Mendes' Goat
while you caress my body with your virginal lips.
Like the Priestess of ISIS, you'll break your sacred oath
and I'll tear up your veil with my sex and my whip.

I'm the Serpent Rainbow, wrapped in the coils
In my grip there's always joy,
with my poison I fill the void.

My seed is the energy that creates new forms of life
astral larvae, homucoli,
evil monsters and parasites.

When the time will come, at the boundary of infinity
we will wake the Serpent Lord
with our brain, muscles and sword.

Our union conspires against every desire,
our orgasm will be the flame that will light the raging fire
where the Universal Minds shall burn the impurities
of a meaningless life and then fly away with me.
