You're the matter, the motion and the mind.
You're the great realization of my perfect self.
You devour and destroy the Gods of earth
and consent the incarnation of joys of life.

You have gathered the fruit of knowledge's Tree.
All the wisdom you give is just the food I need.
Now I've learned the balance of my brain
and I follow the law of Universal Love.

Now I see! Mow I hear
the voice of my Angel that comes to wake up me.

Now I dress my dead body like a king
then I shed all my clothes to live again.
With my birth I can reach the joys of God.
I'll free soul and body from impurity.

Come to me! I invoke Thee!
Holy Guardian Angel my will is inside your name.

Now my old being is dead but I'm reborn.
With your help I renew my weary life through love.
Now I start to converse with all my Gods.
I can scatter my seed into the spate of stars.

Come to me! I invoke Thee!
Holy Guardian Angel my will is inside your name!
