Hey! Two are the ways to go.
You can run through bidy or soul.
Choose, and follow your instincts,
wake the power of the snake!

I'm walking the way of the left hand
The snake shows my freedom.
I use all his power and strenght
when, where and with whom I will.

Left can raise me towards the sky
where I read my Tantra's name.
My sunbeam can reach the fruit,
light of all my memories.

I'm walking the way of the left hand
The snake shows my freedom.
I use all his power and strenght
when, where and with whom I will.

Sitting in a circle,
worthless woman's on my left,
we are now ready
for the rite of five M.

I'm walking the way of the left hand
The snake shows my freedom.
I use all his power and strenght
when, where and with whom I will.
