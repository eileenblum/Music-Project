The red flame of the gnosis
now burns hidden in me.
From the age of ignorance
it wakes all my dormant cells.

By means of strange drugs and wine
I can explore my own conscience.
I will destroy the old religion
'cause I've discovered my will.

The Phoenix Mass will rise from the ashes.
The returning Bird born again from the ruins.
The Phoenix Mass is purification.
The Mass of Blood is a way to love.

I kneel down, then I drink
the lymph that runs down my chest
and through the cycles of time,
to reach my own perfect goal.

From the bottom of my soul
I make communion with blood
then I invoke all the Spirits
'cause now thay are free to show.

The Phoenix Mass will rise from the ashes.
The returning Bird born again from the ruins.
The Phoenix Mass is purification.
The Mass of Blood is a way to love.
