I am the horned Beast with the seven heads.
I bear the whore, drunk with the blood of Jesus.
I rise from the abyss to avenge the memory of my martyrs,
of Judas, of Cain and all the heretics,
of the swearers, the witches and the heirs of Lucipher's Temple.
I've come to sweep away the Christians nightmare,
to shake the world with the scream of PAN,
to free mankind from the slavery of the beggar God!
REIGN WITH ME IN HELL!
DON'T BE A SLAVE IN HEAVEN!
