The light no longer shines on me
tears in my eyes can't you see
dreamin' of a love that cannot be.

In the darkness of my mind
first start laughing then start crying
and the pain in my heart now makes me blind.

Breakin' breakin' my lonely heart for you
you're living in the dark
but your smile survives in me
memories of you, yesterday you were laying in my arms
while now I cry alone, and you're buried in the dark!

Now I wait for your return
how long must I cry and mourn
but now I know that you can live again.

In the darkness where you rest
I will fight against death
'till fate will bring you back here to me.

Breakin' breakin' my lonely heart for you
you're living in the dark
but your smile survives in me
I never thought this could be, truth is I really can't believe
that your light no longer shines, 'cause you're living in the dark!
