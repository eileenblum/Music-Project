Tonight will be the end of the world
something dreadful in the air.

The fury of nature runs out of control
with the destructive violence of death.

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
hell on Earth, fire in the sky.

A catastrophe of terrible violence!
A catastrophe of terrible violence!

Earth now opens in endless gulfs
volcanos expel boiling lava.

In the sky the lightning strikes
burning everything in its path.

A wind of death destroys the trees
as the world crumbles in a black abyss.

No! This cannot be all nature's work!
This can only be frightful Devil's rage!

The end of the world is coming now
man shall pay for all his sins.

The beast is rising from his deep hell
the eternal fire shall burn the Earth.

It's too late to repent now
This is the dawn of Armageddon's day!

Mankind can't escape from the Devil's rage!
Mankind can't escape from the Devil's rage!
