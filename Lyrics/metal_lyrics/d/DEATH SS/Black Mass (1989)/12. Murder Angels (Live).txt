[Bonus Track]

Here they are! I feel them!
They're coming here to destroy us!
They're the murder angels.

Earth has finished every her resource
Water's at an end, poison in the air
and now come the murder angels.

The people on Earth will be decimated
for useless atomic wars
Animals and vegetation are long since dead
cosmic radiations are stifling us.

Welcome, murder angels!
Welcome, cursed heartless angels
you who come from far away
to be destroyers.

Man is exhausting is normal being
it is the right price for evolution
by the time it's all over.

Matter has reached the ultimate stage
now everything has been created and built
Mental energy choked every substance
now we are all too close to God.

Welcome, murder angels!
Welcome, cursed heartless angels
you who come from far away
to be destroyers.

Ambition has open wide its doors
Greed advances into the human heart
machines have become a religion.

Feelings have changed to radiations
love becomes plastic ice
Human bodies smell of putrefaction
cosmic radiations are stifling us.

Welcome, murder angels!
Welcome, cursed heartless angels
you who come from far away
to be destroyers.
