[Bonus Track]

It's time! I've returned back to life again tonight.
My short length life consecrated to evil...

For so many years every night I leave my coffin
and with my bats I'm transformed into a bloodsucker
looking for your blood.

Every night I sow the terror
and before sunrise I leave
the hot sign of my kiss of death.

You common mortals can't fight against my curse
and of your lives I become the only master
until I will see you bleeding.
I've been immortal for such a long time
for centuries I am the king
but cross and garlic can bring me fear.

Yes, I'm the vampire, the king of the night
Yes, I'm the evil, I am the master of your nightmares.

I am the vampire, the prince of darkness
I am the devil who craves the blood of the human race.

Come with me in the reign of night
taste the flavour of red-hot blood
Enjoy yourself in doing evil
and sit with me at the left of the Devil.

Leave your troubles out of your life
to suck men's lymph you must be able
and when nightime brings you back among the living
you will fly as an immortal, screaming your fury.
