You that think that you're never wrong
You that think the world's gone mad
You with your misguided beliefs
Tell me what is now right or wrong.

I was never one to cry
No I was never scared to die
Now I've finally seen the evil
That every man now hides inside.

Will you someday find it?
Or perhaps you'll be too scared!
Can you feel that deep sensation
to be like me buried alive? Buried alive!

Now you start to feel closed in
in this tomb you fight for air
You feel trapped in these four walls
Now it's your time to repent.
