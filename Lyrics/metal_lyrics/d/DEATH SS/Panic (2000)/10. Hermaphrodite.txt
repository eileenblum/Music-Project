[originally by Limbo]I've seen you, I've seen you
The double-headed one
You appeared to me like an obscene child

You've revealed, you've disclosed
All your secret lust
All the glory of your double properties
The supreme beauty of all your perfect being

Solve et coagula, hermaphrodite
Chased and geburah, hermaphrodite

You're the bearer of light
You're the horned god
Without limits, without shadows, without fears

You are woman and man
You're the quintessence
You're the substance of all elements and laws
Father, mother, son and daughter all in one

Solve et coagula, hermaphrodite
Chased and geburah, hermaphrodite

You can give us the key
Of your seven seals
The great power of all your sexual spells

You're the devil who has found
Our inner truth
The vibration of the energy that feeds
Friend and lover, brother, sister all in one

Solve et coagula, hermaphrodite
Chased and geburah, hermaphrodite
