[originally by Agony Bag]Rabies is a killer, is a killer, is a killer, is a killer yeah
Rabies is a - killer!

If I scream
If I yell

Mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun
To keep away from the canine freind
Till you know that the day is done

Man's best friend is what they say
Keep away from him or you're dead
Foaming in the mouth ain't no joke
It will drive you out of your head

Rabies is a killer, is a killer, is a killer, is a killer yeah
Rabies is a - killer!

If I scream
If I yell

Mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun
To keep away from the canine freind
Till you know that the day is done

Man's best friend is what they say
Keep away from him or you're dead
Foaming in the mouth ain't no joke
It will drive you out of your head

Rabies is a killer, is a killer, is a killer, is a killer yeah
Rabies is a - killer!
