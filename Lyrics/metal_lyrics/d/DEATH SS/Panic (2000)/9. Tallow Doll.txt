I can't stand it when you're foolin' around
If  you leave me I put my spell on you

I will build a wax puppet like you
Then I'll baptize the doll with your name

With a pin I can blow up your mind
With a match I'll burn you inside

There's no way to avoid my call
You're my plaything
You're my tallow doll

I'll possess your body and soul
I'm your master
You are my tallow doll

I don't care if  you don't want my love
All I need is your body to own

Don't forget the great power of my curse
I'm the devil, you're my chosen one

With a pin I can blow up your mind
With a match I'll burn you inside

There's no way to avoid my call
You're my plaything
You're my tallow doll

I'll possess your body and soul
I'm your master
You are my tallow doll

You're my little thing
I got you in my hand
You cannot escape from my wishes

I'm the puppeteer
And I hold your strings 
You're a little toy and I'm the player!
