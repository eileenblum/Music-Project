She lives in the jungle
Between wood and green
She doesn't really know
What good manners mean

She dances in the fire
To the trible beat
But she has a bizarre taste
When it comes to meat

Look out! She's dangerous!
Take care! She's out of control!
She looks so lovable
But she can swallow you whole!

Smash your body!
Tear your skin!
Give your flesh to
The cannibal queen!

Draw your blood,
Brain and spleen!
Give your heart
To the cannibal queen!

She talks to the animals
And walks stark-naked
She's hungry for my love
But her greed is wicked

She has the beauty of a goddess
The sexyest of all
But if you try to touch her
You're on the torture pole

Look out! She's dangerous!
Take care! She's out of control!
She looks so lovable
But she can swallow you whole!
