In a desert of red sand and gravel
There's a place where all pleasures thrive
It's the kingdom of the ancient mother
Where the wisdom of the old survives

I can see the lady clad in purple
She's adorned with all kind of joy
With her perfect beauty carved in marble
She can make me a defenceless toy

I will drink her golden cup of lewdness
'till the bloody lymph will make me drunk
Like a puppet I'll fall upon my knees
In a moment I will lose my pride

Lady of Babylon - Let me adore you
Lady of Babylon - I save my love for you
Lady of Babylon - Come and take me
Lady of Babylon - Take my whole life too

Now I see the seven-headed dragon
With his claws he tears my heart apart
But my journey without her can't go on
I must be sure that a new life will start

I will drink her golden cup of lewdness
'till the bloody lymph will make me drunk
Like a puppet I'll fall upon my knees
In a moment I will lose my pride

Lady of Babylon - Let me adore you
Lady of Babylon - I save my love for you
Lady of Babylon - Come and take me
Lady of Babylon - Take my whole life too

If I'll die, tell me what will remain of my soul?
Is your love all for me or is it out of control?
In this hellish paradise only you have the key
Of the city of light that is waiting for me

Lady of Babylon - Let me adore you
Lady of Babylon - I save my love for you
Lady of Babylon - Come and take me
Lady of Babylon - Take my whole life too
