Welcome to my synagogue
Vagrants, thieves and underdogs
Welcome inside Satan's church
Come and join the party!

Here we wait for Lucifer
'cause tonight he will appear
In the form of a black goat
He will give us the power!

Joy for all
No control!
Free for all
Body and soul!

In the night the bell will toll
Time of sex and rock'n'roll
Madmen, sages, virgins, whores
All delight in the sabbath!

In this pandemonium night
All together we'll unite
To praise the god that's not in the sky
The hidden lord of all freedom!

Joy for all
No control!
Free for all
Body and soul!

Sabbath! Sabbath! Let the sabbath begin!
Sabbath! Sabbath! Let the sabbath begin!

We can't stop the scream of pain
Not a saint but just a man
We only try to live this life
With the power of magick!

Joy for all
No control!
Free for all
Body and soul!

Sabbath! Sabbath! Let the sabbath begin!
Sabbath! Sabbath! Let the sabbath begin! 
Sabbath! Sabbath! Let the sabbath begin!
Sabbath! Sabbath! Let the sabbath begin!
