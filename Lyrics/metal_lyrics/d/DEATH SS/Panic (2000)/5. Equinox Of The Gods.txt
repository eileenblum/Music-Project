A new eon is rising from the horizon
A new epoch starts
A liberator god will drive away the clouds
Of our slavery

The great horus will reclam his rightful throne
Stolen by your Christ
And the eclipse of light and freedom will be erased
And so comes the dawn...

...of the equinox of the gods
And so comes the dawn
Of the equinox of the gods...

The new age of magick was dictated
By the crowned son
It's the power of the master of the beast
That is called man

He will break all our chains taking the place
Of the dying god
And repealed will be all rituals and ordeals
And so comes the dawn...

...of the equinox of the gods
And so comes the dawn
Of the equinox of the gods...
