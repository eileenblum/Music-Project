Come in the house of the cyber god
And connect your soul to heaven
The digital church grants you salvation
24 hours a day

Kneel to the holy terminal
And send an e-mail to Jesus
Your virtual confessor is always ready
To listen to all your sins

Moving the mouse and touch the monitor
So starts the christian game
Come ask forgiveness for your faults
From the celestial screen

You can clean your soul of all your mistakes
The modern house of god can save you
You'll never be alone with all your regrets
You only need you're credit card!

Type in your sins
And then pray to the screen
Of your hi-tech Jesus!
And then wait for the print
Of your hi-tech Jesus!
Hi-tech Jesus!

You can switch on the program you prefer
And then have a chat with your god
The techno-religion is fully equipped
To satisfy all your needs

Don't forget to leave just a little fee
A share for the plastic lord
With a little expense you'll be always sure
To reserve a place in the sky

You can clean your soul of all your mistakes
The modern house of god can save you
You'll never be alone with all your regrets
You only need you're credit card!

Type in your sins
And then pray to the screen
Of your hi-tech Jesus!
And then wait for the print
Of your hi-tech Jesus!
Hi-tech Jesus!
