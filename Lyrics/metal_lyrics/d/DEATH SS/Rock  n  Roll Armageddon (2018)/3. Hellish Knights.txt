Don't let anyone catch you
You have to fly high
Don't let anyone tell you
How to live your life

Avoid being brainwashed
By imposing stereotypes
Think always with your head
Don't let them close your eyes

No rules, no compromise
It's just the way to ride
We go straight to the goal
And fight until we die!

We are the hellish knights
We fight for our freedom
We now demand our right
To live with rock n' roll
We are the night-time kings
We start a revolution
We are the evil beings
That want to change the world

It's time to change our life
There's nothing left to give
We're here to play our songs
It's our time to live

Tonight we reach the stage
No one stands in our way
We want that kind of music
That never goes away

No rules, no compromise
It's just the way to ride
We go straight to the goal
And fight until we die!

We are the hellish knights
