There's no weapons that can kill them.
There's no way to send them back to hell.
They're the warriors you can't defeat.
There's no rule, you're just meat to eat.

Just a night to win this war.
Just a night to save your soul.
They are not what they should be.
They're the soldiers of eternity.

Yeah! Heil! Heil! Heil!
The whole world collides.
That's the fourth Reich.
That's the fourth Reich.
Yeah!
Heil! Heil! Heil!
Take your gun and fight.
That's the fourth Reich.
That's the fourth Reich, yeah yeah.

Walking dead gathered under a flag.
Kill the people and spread their plague.
Extermination is their only goal.
They're not gonna stop until they kill us all.

Just a night to win this war.
Just a night to save your soul.
They are not what they should be.
They're the soldiers of eternity.

Fight your game where evil dwell.
Open up all the gates of hell.
Start the shooting and kill'em all.
That's the time of the final call.
