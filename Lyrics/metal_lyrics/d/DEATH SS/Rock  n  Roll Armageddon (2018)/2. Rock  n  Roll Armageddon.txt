The world is mad, we're running out of time
This is our doom, destruction is coming soon
Now death is near, we feel the breath of fear
It's not enough to pray to make all this go away

No one can stop the madness we've begun
The human race no longer has its place
So we're here tonight to rock with all our might
'Cause Rock will show the way and will be here to stay !

We have an aim, we have a goal
We'll save the world with Rock 'N' Roll
No one to blame and no control
We'll change the world with Rock 'N' Roll

Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll !
Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll Armageddon !
Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll !
Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll Armageddon !

We are all slaves of tyrants evil will
We're like the toy of a deranged boy
The world turns bad and we all have gone bad

We have an aim, we have a goal
We'll save the world with Rock 'N' Roll
No one to blame and no control
We'll change the world with Rock 'N' Roll

Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll !
Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll Armageddon !
Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll !
Rock ! Rock ! It's Rock 'N' Roll Armageddon !
