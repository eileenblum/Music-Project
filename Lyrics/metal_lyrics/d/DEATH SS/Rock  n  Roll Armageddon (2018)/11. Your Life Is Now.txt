Grudge and sadness is all you've ever known
Like a cancer which now has grown
All that anguish has eaten you away
And made you the wreck that you are today

There's nothing to do, nothing to say
This is your life, there's no other way

Don't stop your fight, no doubts and no lies
You could change your mind, you could change
Your life

Lift your head up above the crowd
This is your moment, your life is now
Give me a chance and I will show you how
The things could change, 'cause life is now

This is your time, do what you will do
Follow your love, this is the whole truth
You know that rage could destroy your brain
Win your disease, fight against pain

There's nothing to do, nothing to say
This is your life, there's no other way

Don't stop your fight, no doubts and no lies
You could change your mind, you could change
Your life

Lift your head up above the crowd
This is your moment, your life is now
Give me a chance and I will show you how
The things could change, 'cause life is now

Don't stop your fight, no doubts and no lies
You could shake this world, you could start to fly
