Fate led you to me
When life has kicked me out of the game
Soon I realized
That things would never be the same

Years of loneliness were swept away
In just a day
Something unexpected
Now has come to light my way

You gave me a new strength
The lightness and the will to live
And you made me aware
That there was more that I could give

I've lost my mind, I've lost control
I gave away my body and soul
I've changed my world to live
This madness of love
I've closed my eyes, I've started to fly
You're in my brain all day and night
I'm n a dream to live
This madness of love

I've lost my mind, I've lost control
I gave away my body and soul
I've changed my world to live
This madness of love
I've closed my eyes, I've started to fly
You're in my brain all day and night
I'm n a dream to live
This madness of love

I'm crazy for you
It's strange but it's true
And there's nothing that I could do

I'm feeling so high
I laugh and I cry
I know I'll love you until I die

I love you!
I love you!
