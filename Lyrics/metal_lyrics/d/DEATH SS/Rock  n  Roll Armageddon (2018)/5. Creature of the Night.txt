I watch the sun go down
Another day has gone
I'm standing in the shadows
Waiting for the night to come

Wrapped by the midnight frost
I'm hidden in the mist
With all my senses alerted
I feel my heart starting to beat

I'm a creature of the night
(You know) by day I just survive
But after dark, I come alive
And start to hunt you down

Alone in this world full of lies
I watch the time go by
Looking for a reason
That could fill this empty life

Long time of loneliness
Among a crowd of fools
Switched off all my emotions
And I quenched my thirst for blood

I'm a creature of the night
(You know) by day I just survive
But after dark, I come alive
And start to hunt you down

I am a killer on the loose
Searching for my victim
I am the thieves who'll steal your soul
'Cause you belong to me

Hear me calling
Hear me calling
