Escape from war and disease
There's a world that is better than this
So come on and start choosing a side
In a place where you'll never have to hide

No more misery, violence and pain
No religion that preaches disdain

Stop corruption, dictators and cops
A new life, let's pull out all the stops

The poor get poorer, the rich richer
And society is getting sicker
There's no future, hope and salvation
Save yourself from this degradation

Buy your Heaven, get out from hell
Run and take a stand
In the promised land

A life of pain and frustrations
Book a ticket for your illusions

There's a price that you'll have to pay
If you want to find a new way

The poor get poorer, the rich richer
And society is getting sicker
There's no future, hope and salvation
Save yourself from this degradation

Buy your Heaven, get out from hell
Run and take a stand
In the promised land
