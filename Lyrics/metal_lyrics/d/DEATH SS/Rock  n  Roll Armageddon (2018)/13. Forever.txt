There are times when I look above and far beyond
There are times when I feel the pain that's all around

I'm here again, with my wounds and my disillusions.
I'm here again, growing old and oppressed by life.
I'm here again, obstinate, and I'm blazing my fire.
The reckless one, that never gives up.

Everything can change but you'll be always you
Fighting everyday the strain you've been through
And it doesn't matter which way the world turns
When the devil's fire still burns!

Burn with me, keep young forever!
Light the flame, it will be forever!

Sometimes I'm scared to see what the future will bring.
Sometimes I'm sure I've always done the proper thing.

I'm coming back, with my rage, bringing my resolution
I'm coming back and I'll stay, 'cause I'm wild and untamed
I'm coming back, set in stone and I'm burning on fire
The rebel one, I'll never give up

Everything can change but you'll be always you
Fighting everyday the strain you've been through
And it doesn't matter which way the world turns
When the devil's fire still burns!

Burn with me, keep young forever!
Light the flame, it will be forever!
