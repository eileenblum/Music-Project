Dark is my night
Black as my soul
No rest, no dreams,
No hope and no peace.

I'm reeling, I'm drowning and my weak mind is cracking!
I'm sinking, I ain't breathing, and my black soul is screaming!

Deep is my pain
Deaf as my hate.
Locked in despair
I feed my rage.

I'm laughing, I'm crying, I feel my life that's dying
I'm kneeling, I'm praying and all the gods I'm swearing!

Save me, oh lord!
Save my black soul!

I'm laughing, I'm crying, I feel my life that's dying
I'm sinking, I ain't breathing, and my black soul is screaming!
