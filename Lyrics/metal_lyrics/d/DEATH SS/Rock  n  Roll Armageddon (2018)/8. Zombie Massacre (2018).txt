Ripping through the Earth
Seeking human flesh
Living corpses roam
Craving blood and death

No more place in Hell
Everything is gone
The plague has arrived
We were left alone

Radioactive clouds
Gases in the air
People live like rats
Hidden in the lair

Putrid rotting smell
Piles of corpses bled
Nothing can satiate
The hunger of the dead

No one know the why
For all that it's worth
The hordes of the dead
Are spreading hell on earth

Time is running fast
Dying day by day
This is the sad price
Humans have to pay

It's a new day's dawn
All the hopes are gone
Fighting to survive
Dying to retire

It's a zombie massacre that comes from hell
See people die, hear people yell
A zombie massacre that comes from hell
The Devil has come to ring the death knell
