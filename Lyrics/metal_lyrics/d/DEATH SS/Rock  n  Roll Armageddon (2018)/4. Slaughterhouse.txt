Everyday millions of living leave for their last ride
Belongs without a destiny, things who have no rights

Dirty, wounded, thirsty and tortured, packed inside a cage
Leading to their tragedy, victims of our rage

They don't know the reason, they don't understand why,
They're just born to suffer, they're destined to die.

Exploited for our profit, used for our greed
We don't care about them, we just let them bleed.

I can't stand these murders
Stop these unjust crimes
No more pain and suffering
Stop the slaughterhouse!
We kill them to ear their flesh or in the name of science
We kill them to dress their skin as just an appliance.

We don't care of what they feel, we don't hear their cries
None of us cares when an animal dies.
I can't stand these murders
Stop these unjust crimes
No more pain and suffering
Stop the slaughter
Stop this vile bloodshed
Stop this madness, stop this crime
No more death and torture
No more slaughterhouse!
