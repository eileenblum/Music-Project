Sleep pretty baby don't cry
Sleep baby of mine, close your eyes
Sleep and stop screaming all night
Surrender to slumber don't fight

Nowhere to run to, and no place to hide
Try to calm down, 'cause now you are mine
There is nothing to do, so cease with your whine
Close your wet eyes, sweet baby, goodnight

Trust in me if you don't want to die
Try to love me and you'll see the sky
The days of sadness will soon pass by
Now I'll sing for you this lullaby

Stifle your tantrum, don't kick and don't bite
Stop with your screams, little baby, be quet
There is nothing to do, so cease with your whine
Close your wet eyes, sweet baby, goodnight
