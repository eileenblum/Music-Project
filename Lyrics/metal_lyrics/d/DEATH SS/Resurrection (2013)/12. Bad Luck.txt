"It's true! I bring Bad Luck to the idiots who deserve it!"

I was born on friday thirteen
In the darkest night ever seen
I've got a bad, bad reputation
I have a nasty desposition

I'm son of a seventh son
So you think i'm the cursed one
Black cats fear to cross my path
Superstitions make me laugh

If you don't like all the things that I do
I don't care, to hell I'll send you
If you believe I bring you Bad Luck
Stay away from me and shut up

If misfortune on you struck
I don't give a fuck
'Cause you losers suck
And deserve your Bad Luck

You're always scratchin' at the eight ball
While you're heading for a fall
Just another crack in the mirror
Seven year jinx gettin' nearer
Take a step under the ladder
And your future will look sadder
It's not because you spilled the salt
'Cause your Bad Luck is all your fault

You deserve my hate
So you deserve your fate
