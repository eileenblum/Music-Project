There's something you should never have seen
There's something you should never have known
You shouldn't have been in that place
Tonight you should have stayed at home

Now it's too late to beg for mercy
and it's too late for turning back
There's no one here now that can save you
You only have to run away

Now you're in his view
He'll start hunting you

You better run
You better hide
Can you survive
The darkest night?

You can't escape
You cannot hide
Can you survive
The darkest night?

There's no place where you can find shelter
and there's no one that you can trust
The killer now will come to catch you
you'll feel his fury and all his lust

The slayer now is getting closer
and all your hopes will fade away
you're left alone in the blind darkness
you only have to scream and prey
