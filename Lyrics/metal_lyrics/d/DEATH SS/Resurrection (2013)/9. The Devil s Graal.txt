In the silence of deserted hills
In the whisper of the winter night
From the darkness of the empty time
To the early shafts of morning light

You where out to pass another pleasant night
But soon you realized you're just the chosen one
Love turns to pain, tears turns to blood
The hunt is on, you start to run

I'm the bloody hand
Of an ancient rite
And this is your last goodbye
There's a voice that screams
In my twisted mind
It won't live me until you die

Don't stop your run, don't turn around
Don't cry, don't scream, don't make a sound
Fight for your life with all your might
Cause Satan's wanting you tonight
It's your blood that I'll drink
From the Devil's Graal

I watch the sacred fluid spilling
From your wounds
I gave you a night of joy before I
Let you fall
It is too late to change the wicked
Hands of doom
You only have to obey to the reaper's
Call

I'm the boogie-man of this ruthless night
And I'll tear your soul apart
I'll carve my mark in your trembling flesh
Then you'll feel my deadly bite

Don't stop your run, don't turn around
Don't cry, don't scream, don't make a sound
Fight for your life with all your might
Cause Satan's wanting you tonight
It's your flesh that I'll eat - from
The Devil's Graal
