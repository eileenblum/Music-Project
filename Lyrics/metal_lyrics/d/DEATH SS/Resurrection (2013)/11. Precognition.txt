I stay awake all night
I can't sleep, I can't fight
The hell in my mind
My obsession
Is it nightmare or dream
It's not what it seems
I steel hear a scream
In my mind

I'm caught in a state of deep frustration
I hear a voice like a dark oration
Inside my mind like a premonition
A scary sound that comes from
The depth of Hell!

Reality is deforming,
I've lost my time cognition
All I see is distorted,
I'm in a wrong dimension

I have a bad precognition
In my mind
Something evil that comes out
I have like a premonition
That drives me mad
Something I can't control
Something that sucks my soul
A state of alteration.

I still hear the scream
I'm clouded, I'm ill
The hell that I fill
Is growing
There's nothing I can do
I don't know what is true
It's like passing through
A mirror!

My time is running backwards
Fragments of other lives
I have to cross the last door
I'm ready for my rebirth.
