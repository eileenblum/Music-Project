Light, drive out my night
Thrills - of a loosing life

Screaming aloud at the moon of the woods
I'm running free throgh the fields and
the groves
I am awake in the grip of the snake
strong as a lion and sharp as an
asp - to reach
the Crimson Shrine

Come - over the sea
Come, with hoofs of steel

Roaming as Bacchus, with faims and with pards
With vergins and demons as lovers and guards
I'm here to wait for the sign of your eye
ready to ride in the might of god Pan - to reach
the Crimson Shrine

Thrill with lissome lust of the light
O man! My man!
Come with Apollo in bridal dress
Come with Artemis, silken shod
And wash thy white thigh,beutiful God
Dip the purple of passionate prayer
In the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare
In the might of god Pan

Trembling with ardour in the lust of the light
I hurry forward in the heat of the night
I'm seeking your love to perfect my life
you'll be my goddess, you'll be my bride
We, united in the Crimson Shrine
