Your head in darkness,
Your foots into the mud
Yo're full of questions,
Your body is racked with pain
Your wretched fate has killed all your hopes
You are enslaved, you're crawling in the dark

You're just confused, you wondering in dream
You're scared to die and you can't find a way
You've left behind the science and the false gods
And now you falling, and now you falling down

If life is just turturing you
If hope of love has gone
If you have lost the strength to fight
You search your Star in Sight

Your agony is unnecessary
The empty sky will spread in vain your sod
A feeble fog of thoughts and humn flesh
Will celebrate your insatiable wish

Do what thou wilt because we all are stars
Lions of light, the beasts whose law is love
Pan is alive and will break all the bounds
It's time to change, it's time to change your life

So spread your wings and fly away
Fly high and touch the sun
All what began will never end
You search your Star in Sight
