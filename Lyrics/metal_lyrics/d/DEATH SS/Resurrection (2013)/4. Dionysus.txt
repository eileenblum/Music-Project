You bring the wine of love from the gold barrels of the sun
You spread all pleasures of this life and joy to everyone

We will dance with you through enchanted hills and moonlight woods
Our joyful chants will praise aloud your name all along the route

The rocks and trees are yours and everything that's on the hill
You lead us all forever with the power of your will
We'll light the stars and burn the ground with the red flames of hell
You'll guide us through the night to your party and never dwell

With you we'll finally lift the mask of matter and start to see
So we can free our senses in delight and ecstasy

We'll be free to run into the
night from star to star
so we will see the things
of life for what they
really are

Dionysus ...
No limits and no boundries

Dionysus ...
We're wed, we're strong, we're rebels, we are one

Dionysus ...
A life with no apologies

Dionysus ...
We're wild, we're free, we'll never be, we'll never be alone!
