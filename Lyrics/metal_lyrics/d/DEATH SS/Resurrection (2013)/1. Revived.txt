I've gone to see hell
and now I've come back
I fought with the devil
and broken our pact.
All the lives I had
I've not spent them all
I have more things to do
before darkness falls.
I can't stop my march
'cause I have to fulfill
the mission in Hell
that has blessed my Will.
The cold hand of death
still digs inside me
I was killed for my sins
but now my soul is free.

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Nothing to forgive
No one to trust.

Now i'm here again
in need of ressurection
Now i want to change
and find a new direction.
I died to forget
The pain I felt inside
my fight goes on again
but still I know I'll have to die
I'll die!
I know I have to die
but then I'll be revived!

All of my life
has gone in a flash
All of my dreams
were turned into ash.
Walking the path
of my last existance
I can shed my thoughts
maintaining a distance.

I'm coming back!
I'm coming back!
I'm coming back
and I'll fight to survive!
