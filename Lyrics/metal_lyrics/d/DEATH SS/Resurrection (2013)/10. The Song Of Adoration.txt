I am the lord of thebes
The harbringer of the god of war
I can see throgh the veiled sky

I invoke the words of Truth
For thouse who are living in the light
To reach the place where the stars shine

I great your presence, God
Show me the power of your breath
Open the ways of my true Will

My other spirit runs through
To stir me or soothe me in your might
So that your flame can
Burn me inside

Oh, Lord
Your light is mine
Its rays consume my soul
I am the one, the prophet of your Law
I beat my chest, I weave my spell
Show me the splendour of your love

I've made a secret door
To reach the house between the stars
So that your sheen may live in me

Recieve my adoration
Oh, winged snake who made the Sun
Your rays will shine upon your throne
