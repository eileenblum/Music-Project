I feel her coming
the wicked woman
that cursed mama
is back on Earth.

That horrible lady
dressed in rags
She brings us the squalor
of her ancient sins.

The rotten embrace
of her old, sick paunch
that has brought to life
the sons of Black Death.

You ambiguous bigot
with the heart of a fiend
have given us life
in a summer of pain.

Return back to hell to you incestuous love
you renegade ma that never lets go
acid stepmother of all evil forces
have just taken our soul now leave us alone!

Right, nazi mama, kill your evil sons!
Cursed mama, cursed mama, ecc.
