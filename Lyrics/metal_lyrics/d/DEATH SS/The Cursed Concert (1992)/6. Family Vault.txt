On the point of death the patriarch said:
"Don't bury me in a common grave,
But in an unusual, comfortable family vault".

You must build my tomb according to my wishes
To prevent that my mortal remains
Should return from Hell, to spread the disease I had when I lived.

Money and success, you were my only reason of life.
Candles, tombstones, will be my company in this family vault.

Listen to me said the patriarch
I can see next to me the reaper
My time is almost through, you must promise me to respect my will.

The heritage I leave to all you still living
Goes beyond all my material wealth
You'll discover it and then understand in my burial place.

Money and success, you were my only reason of life.
Candles, tombstones, will be my company in this family vault.

You must build my tomb with your guilty deeds
Every brick can bind one of your sins
And cement the blood of my cursed youth that won't come back.

The deeds of all men survive eternal rest
And I hope that my building will help
People that will come in this evil life, to understand.
Money and success, you were my only reason of life.
Candles, tombstones, will be my company in this family vault.
