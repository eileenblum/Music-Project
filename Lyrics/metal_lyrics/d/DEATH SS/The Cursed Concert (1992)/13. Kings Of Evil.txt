You foolish mortals who live your life like sheep
in this meaningless world
you who live a normal life
following the laws of human greed.

Don't hope in a better future
nor in the progress of hallowed science
there's just one way that can get you high
you must search for it into the mist of time.

Burn with us in the eternal flame!

You gotta fight against reactions
clench your fists but don't despair
destroy every link with your false doctrines
only this way you can have power.

Free yourself from false beliefs
in exchange you'll realize your wishes
the occult desires will calm your thirst
and you'll be acclaimed in a better world.

Come with us! We're the Kings of Evil!
We wanna fight for a new creation!
Come with us! In the Satanic Service!
We wanna destroy to reconstruct!
