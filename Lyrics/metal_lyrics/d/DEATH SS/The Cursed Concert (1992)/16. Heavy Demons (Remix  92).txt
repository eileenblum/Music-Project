[Bonus Track]

We were born on the night of Apocalypse
We arrived here riding the light
We dare the forces of creation
We rule the world and the elements.

We bring war, death and destruction
We change the course of time.
We fight to free the human madness
And let the metal rise.

Don't betray the faith or you'll have to pay
We're the only ones that make you feel good.
We break the laws that chain your mind
We're the Evil Gods of immorality.

We're the Heavy Demons, Heavy Metal Demons
You can't stop our Rock!
Join the Heavy Demons, music fighting Demons
'Cause we want your Soul!

We're here to play that cursed music
That parents and teachers love to hate
We'll melt your brain with metal power
That burns forever young.

When we're on stage we like to see
Your young blood burst in flames.
You know we take no prisoners
We play and you must die!

We're the Heavy Demons, Heavy Metal Demons
You can't stop our Rock!
Join the Heavy Demons, music fighting Demons
'Cause we want your Soul!
