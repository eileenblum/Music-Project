Veni, domine liberator
Dona nobis potestatem.
Te adoramus, veneramus
Dona nobis scientiam.

You're the Horned God of Witches
You're the adored Templar's Idol
You're the Father Mithra of all of us!

You've got different faces and powers
We'll awake you with sex and prayers
To help us make gold, oh Lord Moon's Dyer!

Calling you I ride the lightning
Praying you to set me free
When I invoke you I reach the power
In your light my mind is free.

Only you can give the solution
Helping us to accomplish the Great Work
You will open the Arcane Doors of the Sacred Reign.

And through the baptism of fire
Mete will make all things blossom
I abjure my faith for yours, for all your pleasures!

Calling you I ride the lightning
Praying you to set me free
When I invoke you I reach the power
In your light my mind is free.

You bring the sign of the Holy Star
Your bosom feeds the Eternal Light
You show the moons of Chased and Geburah
Solve et Coagula, oh Baphomet!

Calling you I ride the lightning
Praying you to set me free
When I invoke you I reach the power
In your light my mind is free.
