I'm in for a spree at the doctor's store
I'm feeding off my brain but I need something more
I can't kill the noise that's inside my head
'Cause it drives me crazy, it will leave me dead

I can't stand the voices, I can't stand the sound
It's just a broken record keep on spinning around
And it won't stop play until will hit the ground
I'm a cyber junky, I need to rebound

Hey, hey, hey, give me a shock treatment
Hey, hey, hey, give me some peace
Hey, hey, hey, mental assestment
Hey, hey, hey, kill my disease

I'm taking on the fastline to find a cure
If I could find a pusher my strength would endure
I feel my pain is growing, I'm out of the schemes
Maybe a lobotomy ain't bad as it seems

I can't stand the voices I can't stand the sound
It's just a broken record keep on spinning around
And it it won't stop play until will hit the ground
I'm a plain outsider with a brain of a down

Hey, hey, hey, give me a shock treatment
Hey, hey, hey, give me some peace
Hey, hey, hey, mental assestment
Hey, hey, hey, kill my disease
