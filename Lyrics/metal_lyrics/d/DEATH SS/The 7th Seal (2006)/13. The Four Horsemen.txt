[Bonus Track][originally by Aphrodite's Child]And when the lamb opened the
First seal,
I saw the first horse.
The horseman held a bow

Now when the lamb opened the
Second seal,
I saw the second horse
The horseman held his sword

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green
And when the lamb opened the
Third seal,
I saw the third horse.
The horseman had a balance

Now when the lamb opened the fourth seal,
I saw the fourth horse.
The horseman was the pest

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green

The leading horse is white
The second horse is red
The third one is a black,
The last one is a green
