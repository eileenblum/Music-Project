I've lost my strength, I've lost my pride
And all my excuses turned into lies

I wrote my thoughts on the wall
But I am left with nothing at all

I wanna get rid of my apathy
I know that's all is left of me

I have misses my way
On a heck of a day
Life has gave me a chance
But I threw it away

Same old faces, timeless days
I see my life left to decay

And the walls that I create
No, cannot hide the things I hate

I stand alone to dig this hole
And try to fill my empty soul

Please make it go away
My days are cold and gray
I need a new today

Don't let it end this way
I'm tired to whine and pray
No, I don't wanna stay
On a heck of a day
