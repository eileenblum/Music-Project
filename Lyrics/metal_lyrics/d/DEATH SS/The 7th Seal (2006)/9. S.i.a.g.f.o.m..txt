I'm coming through your wishes
You've called me with your lust
I'm flest and evil spirit
I'm hiding in your blood

Don't underrate me baby, 'cause
I'm worse than what you think
But if is hell what you are craving for
I'm the right one made for you, 'cause

I'm the malign
My malice has no confine
Say it in your mind
Satan is a good friend of mine

I'll make you feel sensations
That you have never tried
I am the devil and I'm human
I'm fury, sex and might

Don't try to tame me baby, 'cause
I'm wild and I'm unleashed
I'll satisfy your fancies and then
I'll drag you inside my hell, 'cause

I'm the malign
My malice has no confine
Say it in your mind
Satan is a good friend of mine

Don't play with fire or you'll burn
You don't know what you've evoked
I'm cruel and I'm excessive but
This is what I'm famous for
