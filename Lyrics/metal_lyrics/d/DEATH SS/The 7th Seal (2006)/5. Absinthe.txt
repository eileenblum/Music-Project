Evoke the green fairy
And free all your dreams
Fall into oblivion
And melt in absinthe

The emerald spirit
Will get you high
You'll face all your fears
And your mind will fly

Naje your life a little easer
Ease your brain and spread your wings
Come to taste a glass of madness
If you want to live your dreams
Dance a waltz with the green lady
And then you as might well see
What's the world of the free spirits
And how paradise could be

Oh, a trip to wonderland
Oh, a party with no end

Evoke the green fairy
And free all your dreams
Fall into oblivion
And melt in absinthe

The emerald spirit
Will get you high
You'll face all your fears
And your mind will fly

If you crave a new sensation
That's the best you can get
And the night will show her secrets
All the things you cannot see
You will really know thyself
All the feelings that you hide
Bite the apple of the poets
Let the fairy be your bride

Oh, a trip to wonderland
Oh, a party with no end

You are my everything
My narcoleptic dream
My moral floats around
I falling to the ground
My head's like a hole
I've lost my control
I'm cure of my disease
I've numbed hands and knees
I finally see the light
I'm starting my flight

And I feel well
It's just a sweet hell
And now I know the only thing
I really need to do
