Harmony, grace and beauty
I still seek in the matter
A Venus' gliph, rings and crosses
Intellect, ego's wishes
A reflex in the mirror
Puls of life that bever stops
What the way to divide
Equilibrium from joy?

Give me a new reason to fight
I've lost my faith and pride
In this world I despise
I'm tired of lies
So let me fall on the other side

Give me a new reason tonight
There's nothing left to hide
It's time to say 'Goodbye'
And that's allright
So watch me die into the other side

Silent screams from the darkness
Stolen words from a screenplay
Venus' gliph, great deceiver
Empty stare, greedy lover
Blinded eyes and no more speeches
Feel the cold of the mirror
There's no way to modify
Our role in this game

Give me a new reason to fight
I've lost my faith and pride
In this world I despise
I'm tired of lies
So let me fall on the other side

I feel the cold
I can't fight for long
In this dying machine
I can hear my scream
Nowhere to hide
I'm trapped inside
Can't see the light
But that's allright

Give me a new reason to fight
I've lost my faith and pride
In this world I despise
I'm tired of lies
So let me fall on the other side

Give me a new reason tonight
There's nothing left to hide
It's time to say 'Goodbye'
And that's allright
So watch me die into the other side
