Just another night to feed my pangs
Just another wake to pray this hell
My thoughts are running wild and time flies away
Heaping up another useless day

And all that could have been and hasn't been
And all that could have been but hasn't been

I'm still waiting for my glory days
Saying to myself I'll find the way
I don't wanna stop and carry on
Even if I have to fight alone

But I just have to wait a while again
Yes I just have to white a while again

I need another hour
Another day, another life
I need another hour
Another day, another life

Here I'll go again
To sooth my wounds and pain
In my castle made of sand
When this will come to an end?

Oh lord
Hear me, help me, save me
Hear me, help me, save me

And all that could have been but hasn't been
And all that could have been but hasn't been

But give me another hour
Another day, another life
Another hour
Another day, another life
