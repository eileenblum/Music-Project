I'll lead you through the web of your mind
I'll sooth your endless pain
I'll take away your nightmares, darling
I'll feed your darkest side

I'll realize your fantasies
I'll turn you in someone else
I'll lift the burden of your worries
I'll make you feel complete

I'll give you everything you need
You only have to call my name, now

Call me - I am the healer
Reach out for my hand
Cann me - I am the healer
So please let me in

Your head is filled with confusion
You crave the touch of love
You need someone to hold on to
You need my medicine
