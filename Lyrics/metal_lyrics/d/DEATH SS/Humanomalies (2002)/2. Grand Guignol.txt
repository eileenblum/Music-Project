I'll give you a world I've painted red I'll take you soul apart
I'll cover you with curdled blood I'll show you what's my art
I'll stick a nail right in your tongue I'll poke and chew your eyes
I'll main your body live on stage with my cruel device

In the Grand Guignol
I'll grant blood thrill for all

Violence is my theatre play that shows again 'n' again
Starring freaks and headless corps enough to drive you insane
Creepy, crawling and slimy things alla aboard the horror's train
With naked dancers and snarling beasts we'll play the play that's pain

In the Grand Guignol
I'll grant blood thrill for all

So come along for tonight's ride your tremble, laugh and pray
All excess are included in the price you'll pay

In the Grand Guignol
I'll grant blood and thrill for all
