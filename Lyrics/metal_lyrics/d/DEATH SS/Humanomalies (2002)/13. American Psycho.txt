The American psycho wants
The American psycho says
The American psycho needs

Let me hypnotize you
Let me take control
Let me radiate you stupid little soul
I'll give you heaven I'll give you Broadway
I'll give you I'll give you the empire state
Let me mesmerize you
Let me come inside
There's no way to escape this look in my eyes
You know I need flesh
You know I need flesh
Don't you worry honey I'll clean up all the mess

Let me come inside you
Let entertain
You know this will cure and take away your pain
This is like Vegas
This is for fun
This is like the movies
This is.....This is.....
