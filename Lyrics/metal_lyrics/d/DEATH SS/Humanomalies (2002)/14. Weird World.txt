Cyber-hackers, spaced-out freaks
Metal junkies, goths'n'geeks
Mutant bikers, lesbian whores
Twisted tyrants and all the impures

Paranoia in on the wall
It's a war, we're 'bout to fall
See no evil, feel no pain
In our soul there's no stain

Yeah! this is the weird world the place to flare your life
All your queers are welcome here
Everyone can be a star

A psycho heaven, a rebel ride
Where you don't need to pick a side
Where you sale truth, where you sale lies
Buy a new God when the old one dies

Subhuman jungle of flesh and blood
Start a battle just for fun
Nothing's right, nothing's wrong
Land of freedom can you play this tool?

Yeah! Join the weird world the place to free your mind
Just tell us what you realy need
To get away from the mankind
