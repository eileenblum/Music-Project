We're the so-called monsters
We're bong-water hits
We're so different from you
We're so different within
We're the image of fear
Something you can't control
What you can't foresee
We're the scum of the world

So come on, come on and jon the monsters
Come on, come on and laugh at the freaks
Don't be afraid to enter the circus
You can be sure that the show will be great

We're the evil freaks
We're satanic thicks
Humanomalies
The freaks of nature
We're the evil freaks
No deceits no tricks
The new progeny from hell

You can't give us a name or a spot in the sun
We're the sheeps out'o'flock
Something that can't be touched
We're a cancer that grows
The unsuccessful test
Aberration of rules
The unforgiven incest

So come on, come on and jon the monsters
Come on, come on and laugh at the freaks
Don't be afraid to enter the circus
You can be sure that the show will be great

We're the evil freaks
We're satanic thicks
Humanomalies
The freaks of nature
We're the evil freaks
No deceits no tricks
The new progeny from hell
