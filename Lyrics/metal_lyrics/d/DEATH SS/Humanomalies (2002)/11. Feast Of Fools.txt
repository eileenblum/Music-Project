I'm the lord of disillusion drugged-up for the rave
Join the unholy party with no masters and no slaves
Wear your leather mask and then brand my altar boys
Ride the restless mammeles and abuse'em just like toys

Tonight we're gonna burn this town
Tonight we'll change the rules
We'll set the world upside-down
This is the feast of fools

Eat out from my flesh while clergy is say mass
Sing a filthy song and show rage making a mess
Pray to the crossdresser before entering the church
Stain the walls around you with a stinking bloody-smirch

Tonight we're gonna burn this town
Tonight we'll change the rules
We'll set the world upside-down
This is the feast of fools

Fill this night with pleasure
Unchain your evil ghouls
