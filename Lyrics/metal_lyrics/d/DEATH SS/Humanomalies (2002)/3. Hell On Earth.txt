She worked in a carnival locked up in a pit
And drew in lots'o customers 'cause she had a fucekd-up nitch
She was a sick attraction half woman and half beast
But despiting her oddities she had a sexy twist
Her face was just a mess of hair with two big bulging eyes
But there was something about her that left me petrified
And roght behind this decadence something really knocked me out
A creepy thought of twisted sex was slowly coming out

She was my lover
The monster whore She was my hell on earth
She was the goddes
The lustful beast She was my hell on earth

Someone said that long ago she was a normal gal
And that her actual chastly look came from a jealouse guy
Some other swears about this thing it was the work of the God
But anyway her simple sight polluted all my blood

She was my lover
The monster whore She was my hell on earth
She was the goddes
The lustful beast She was my hell on earth
