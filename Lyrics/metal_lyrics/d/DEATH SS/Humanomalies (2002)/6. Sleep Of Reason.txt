I'm on my knees to save what's left of my soul
The God of nothing nailed my brain to his pole
Spitting out my thoughts like fires from hell
I'm locked up inside this cold prison cell

But every night I cross my heart waiting for to die
I've got something inside
A pain I cannot hide

In the sleep of reason take your lies away from me
Everyone carries his own monstrosity

It's me, It's me not you ordinary monster
It's me, It's me with no escape


I'm afraid of what I could see
Cheating demons steal the souls of the free
Evil crowed hidden behind a mask
Setting the rules for a criminal task

But every night I cross my heart waiting for to die
I've got something inside
A pain I cannot hide

In the sleep of reason take your lies away from me
Everyone carries his own monstrosity

It's me, It's me with no escape
In the sleep of reason take your lies away from me
Everyone carries his own monstrosity
