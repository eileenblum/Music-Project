[Alice Cooper cover]

"Finally alone! - I want you so much!
The sweetest bride!"...

You're pale as the moon
mysterious as the night
your beauty's like a statue
you're cold as ice!

You're motionless in your grave
silent like Death
you're rigid in your limbs
you are so dead!

I love the dead before they're cold
Their bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see - nothing!

I love the dead before then rise
no farewells - no goodbyes
I never even know your rotting face
while friends and lovers mourn your silly grave!

I love the dead! - I love the dead!

You're finished your existence
don't shout for your madness
don't tremble for your fear
bleed for the disease!

Now you're free to believe
don't ask me to remain
you're ready to realize
how I love the dead!

I love the dead before they're cold
Their bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see - nothing!
