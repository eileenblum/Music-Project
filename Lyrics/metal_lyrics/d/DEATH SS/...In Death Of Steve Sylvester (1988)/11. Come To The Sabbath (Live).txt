[Black Widow Cover]
[Bonus Track]

Help me in my search for knowledge
I must learn the Secret Art.
Who dares to help me raise the one
Whose very name near stills my heart?

Astaroth!

Discard your clothes and come on foot
Through streams and fields and moonlit moors,
your bodies soaked in secret oils
Perfumed herbs will heal your sores
Join me in my search for power
Wives and husbands bring your kin.
We'll be as one within the hour.
Let the Sabbath now begin.

Come, come, come to the Sabbath.
Come to the Sabbath - Satan's there!
