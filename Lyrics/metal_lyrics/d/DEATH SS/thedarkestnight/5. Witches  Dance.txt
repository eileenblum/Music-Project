I've got a dream
I've got a dream
I've got a dream like a feeble gleam

I've got a chill
I've got a chill
I've got a chill like an upcoming thrill

People screaming, shaking and crawling
Like in a witches dance

I've got a lust
I've got a lust
I've got a lust from an obscure past

I've got a sight
I've got a sight
I've got a sight of a hellish night

People screaming, shaking and crawling
Like in a witches dance

Getting louder, getting hotter, dancing all
Night long
Getting faster, getting higher, dancing all
Night long.

People screaming, shaking and crawling
Like in a witches dance
