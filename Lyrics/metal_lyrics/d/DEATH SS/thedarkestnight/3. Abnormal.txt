Let me be a bad teacher without taboos and games
Let me now provoke you with my truth and fame
I'm a living sculpture and my body is art
I can change my aspect right the way I want

I'm the abnormal
The different being
The mutant I'm the filthyest thing

Let me win your fears through my wounds and blood
Let me show you freedom with a brutal shock
I'm a work of instruments tested by disgrace
I attack morality and your fuckin race

I'm the abnormal
The different being
The mutant I'm the filthyest thing

Let me show you outer limits
- subhuman obsession -
Transmutation of the flesh
A new art A kind of vision
- break the borders -
Something that you can't control

I'm the abnormal
The different being
The mutant I'm the filthyest thing
