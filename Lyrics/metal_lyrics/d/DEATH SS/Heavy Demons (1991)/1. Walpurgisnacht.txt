When the winds blows through the trees
When daylight is too far gone
And nightime falls on these desolate lands.
When a thin fog drifts over houses and farms
When darkness rules the village streets
And dogs are howling with fear.
When all the doors and windows are locked
When in the distance strange lights
Illuminate ghostly figures
And devilish shadows are flying high
Piercing with anguish the hearts of men
In this terrible night.
A sinister echo resounds in the air:

Walpurgisnacht!
Walpurgisnacht!
Walpurgisnacht!

S. Valpurga - Save us from evil!
S. Valpurga - Pray for our soul!
