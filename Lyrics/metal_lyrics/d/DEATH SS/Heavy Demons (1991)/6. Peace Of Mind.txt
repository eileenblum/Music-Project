Have you ever seen the Holy Light?
I want to reach all wisdom's highest degrees to write my book.
I had to fight against hostile ghosts
and as I reached the red doors of the spell Evil appeared.

God! The rite must be accomplished!
Help me in my search of truth
Give pleasure to my brain.

Man! You read my book of rules
And when there's no way to go
All power you shall gain

Complete intoxication every man can find
The ravaging sensation gives him peace of mind.

I'll keep total control of body and soul
And give my blood and happiness for the love of the absolute.
Give me the strength to be completely pure
My body is ready and my mind is free from every sin.

God! The rite must be accomplished!
Help me in my search of truth
Give pleasure to my brain.

Man! You read my book of rules
And when there's no way to go
All power you shall gain

Complete intoxication every man can find
The ravaging sensation gives him peace of mind.
