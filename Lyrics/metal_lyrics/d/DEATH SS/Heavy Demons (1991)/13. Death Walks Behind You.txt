[Atomic Rooster Cover]
[Bonus Track]

Death walks behind you,
Death walks behind you,

Lock the door, switch the light.
You'll be so afraid tonight.
Hide away from the beast,
Count the nine lives that you had.

Start to scream, shout for help,
There is no one by your side.
To forget what is done,
Seems so hard to carry on.

Death walks behind you,
Death walks behind you,

(Death walks behind you,)
(Death walks behind you.)

Luck is gone, end is near,
Bring yourself to understand,
It's your fate, or what's cast,
Point a finger at yourself.

(Death walks behind you,)
(Death walks behind you.)
