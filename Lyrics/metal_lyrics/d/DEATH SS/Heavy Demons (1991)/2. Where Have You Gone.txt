Father of the world, where have you gone?
The sons you have made are loosin' their minds.

The seed of all evil is now sown in their hearts
War killing machine is never gonna stop.

No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?

Your child of madness is longing for his life
'Cause war, sickness and death have knocked him to the ground

This world is going to pieces,
We can't make it all alone
We have been forsaken
At the beginning of the end.

No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?

Slaughter! Illness! Death!
War! AIDS! Drugs!
Fanatics! Priests! Bombs!
You don't care!

No! No! No! No! No!
This is not the way to go
The world needs your love!
Where have you gone?
