You're searching for high knowledge but truth is only one
And many can be all its form of expression.
You now must understand the double aspect of things
The holy, the profane, the occult and the clear.

Searching the way to power you reach the light
You can learn the secret laws of your life.
Spirit is the only pure and sure reality
Matter is only its inferior alteration.

Truth is possessed by the wise men of Earth
You only need to seek and bring it to the light.
Your existence is the result of a choice
A chain of death continued day after day.

Searching the way to power you reach the light
You can learn the secret laws of your life.
Spirit is the only pure and sure reality
Matter is only its inferior alteration.

With death the spirit leaves behind its faults
And takes you closer to the verity
Someone will ask you to show him the proof
But the proof is matter and you know matter is man.
