Lilith queen of the darkest night
You give life to monsters in my mind
You sustain necromancers work
And appear like an evil cloud.

Oh black, infernal moon that crosses the sky
Like a dark, shooting star that obscures the light.
Oh black eclipse show me the shadows of distant ghosts
Celestial demons that roam blindly in the night.

We scar our bodies with signs of crossed moons
And then pronounce the magic words of a spell.
You shine for us your black light in the sky
And lead the way for the astral vampires.

Lilith, Satan's wife
Angel of the night
Give to us tonight
Your fairy mother's might.

You blend the heating vapours of bleeding earth
With the cold lymph of our vital sky.
You enfold us with your vampire wings
And take us to the realm of Holy Death.

Lilith, Satan's wife
Angel of the night
Give to us tonight
Your fairy mother's might.
