And now you sleep
Your longest and last sleep
With no awakening

Under that holy cross
That stands tall in the wind in memory.

The epitaph upon your grave
Reminds us still
Of your great love for life.

Now listen to me
You're ready to be
Led across the way
From which you cannot stray.

The phase you're begun
Leads you towards the sun
And when you'll see the light
It will end your plight

In all soul's day

The trumpets of judgement
Shall call again
For your cold body.

Your empty orbits
Now full of worms
Return to see again

'Cause we're all here
And here we wait
While your ashes
Blow like dust in the wind.

Now listen to me
You're ready to be
Led across the way
From which you cannot stray.

The phase you're begun
Leads you towards the sun
And when you'll see the light
It will end your plight

In all soul's day
