tied, conniving control
the faith deceived for the sake of today
we have sold tomorrow

i hate this, i hate you
who accepts this lie in silence

i hate this, our false values
why don't we all see through this

unheard, fixed in your own world
lost in society, too far gone
is it too fucking late?

i hate this
i hate a veiled invert frustration
turned in, onto, your own
from the hand that rocks the cradle
ashes will unfold

release ourselves from these actions
how you keep us distracted

what do you really wish
to understand exactly what's behind
your real desire here
inside, nothing holds freedom silent

and we will die in our own ignorance
awaiting blindly
and i'll be without tears
