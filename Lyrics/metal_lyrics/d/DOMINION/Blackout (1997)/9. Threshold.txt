and life it's hard
struggling from day to day
while the powers that be
feed us shit they want us to believe
and life it's hard
we're getting fucked from day to day
working as slaves to fulfill
their corruptable greed

i'm not gonna take this anymore
offered a chance to equal the score
we're all covered in blood, yeah
we're all covered in our own blood
to you it's an impoverished few
it's about time you looked at the full scope
we'll be covered in blood, yeah
covered in your blood again

rise up, rise up, rise up and take control
replace mistakes from history
a chance to call the world our own
yeah, we're not backing down
we shall be forever
when the shit hits the fan
you'll be the one who's left here screaming

and life it's hard
it's getting easier day by day
making fools of the few
who just wish they knew

and life it's hard
it's about time we opened a new scope
you'll be covered in blood
covered in your own blood again

rise up, rise up, rise up and take control
replace mistakes from history
a chance to call the world our own
