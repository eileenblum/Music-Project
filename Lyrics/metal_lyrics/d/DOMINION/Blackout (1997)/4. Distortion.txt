i see through me, inside the outside of you
can things seem so close
so near, yet too far out of reach
distorted veils from behind which only i see
the clear perception of what life rally should be

take my hand, dependent to feel
insanity for what is real
in twisted redemption, release the confines
reality seems to restrict with

one side say it's a sin, indulgence, let it suck you in
at peace when out of you mind
to kill another day in my life

seems so feint, can't find my way out of this maze
drowning deeper, the soul believer
taking my life is the only way

lost inside mental feeling
how different i percieve this life
of unseen madness
in a state of awareness, i cling to revelations
inverted to make the most sense

just a fool who's lost his way
when each night blurs into day
not willing to count the cost
i'm just adicted, my life is lost
can't you see, fuck i'm in pain
no life to lead, nothing to gain
