afraid to feel in seclusion we hide away
this face, unseen, instinct denies true liberty

and thy soul, signifies the true self
denied the role destined to be alone

sever the weakened
sever inside
will i forever live
in deceit of myself?

trust my imptression
and i've sold you the lies
that hide as they reflect
the same disguise

betrayal beneath this, confusion weeps inner tears
untold in fear, afraid to lose the dignity

and i don't understand why hate should rise
above to hold as reliance to survive
