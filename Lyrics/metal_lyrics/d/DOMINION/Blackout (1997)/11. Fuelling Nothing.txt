trivial to your allure to this growth
through technology
you place, our worth under efficiency

stand our common ground
we've got our own lives to lead
a posture in time, resulting human demise

indignant to our value as expendabe energy
withdraw our life
from reason to exist here

and when you
take this defenceless last life in
which greed blatantly guided
you will discover you cannot
survive on worth here

look at what you have taken
and devoured, devoured
always a price to be placed

which is priority?
wasted development
no morality to progression
it collides witin your greed

what it gains doesn't justify
reasonless production - fuelling nothing

as we suceed we bleed
