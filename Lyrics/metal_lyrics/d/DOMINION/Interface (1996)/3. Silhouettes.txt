Unknown to me the sun deceives, storms from the east, crimson now is the sea
Black shapes unknown that resemble human form
In the rains they came to free us from this mortal coil

Shall we see in the fullness of time if the prophecies can shine through
The silhouettes against the sun

The promises of a brave new world slipped straight through our weary eyes
Behind the blue sky horizon remains only truth

The beginning is the end, we are twisted never to be reborn
Just as a soft breeze carries dead leaves, the rains shall never cease
