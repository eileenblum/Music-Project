Stay away from the future, but do not live in the past
The concept of never being is the false truth that speaks its mind
Do I control your visions, those that create your dreams?
Enshrouded by twilight mists, the lust of the final graven kiss

Just like ashes to ash, your flesh will be touched once again, a kiss by the 
wreath

The soil separates you from me, but our love is soon to return
As sure as the sun brings the dawn, and the meadows blood from the earth
Just like the first time you kissed me, and the blood rained forth from the 
sky
The crimson tears of heaven drain deep into me

The fallen leaves that hide your face, the erotic sensation of dead embrace
The taste of your cold sweet tongue, we have yet to finish what I begun

Kiss by the wreath, cold heat as our flesh meets
