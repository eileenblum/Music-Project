I'm going to drain you now to the very threshold of death
The flow of blood through your veins and that same blood through mine
It is your consciousness, your will which must keep you alive

A shock of sensation not unlike the pleasure of passion
I felt his teeth withdraw with such a keenness, I felt no more

Drink on my gaping wound and feel our heart beat become one
Release all of your human grief and sleep off your death

And I drank for the first time since infancy
The special pleasure of sucking nourishment

To focus on one vital source, I lay there waiting to die

Neglecting my thirst made it grow
Torn apart to take no action to starve the burning of need to drink

Don't fall so madly in love with the night that you lose your way
I saw the moon on the water, I stared for what seemed eternity...
