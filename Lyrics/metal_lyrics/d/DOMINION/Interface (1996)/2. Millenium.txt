In the new age we see the combinations of human consciousness and science
Dominated by the element, our imagination having turned towards the sky
New frontiers cause the reformation of the human race
Celebration of ourselves and our sanctity of the earth
Our civilization has entered the millennium of peace and wisdom
We have begun to live our lives as part of the galactic community
Our world has no boundaries, but have we now become a selfish race?
Obsessed by our power and freedom we are becoming insane

People are now spawning our future generations, they will hold the power to 
create life

Possessing the ability to travel through out the cosmos
Free from all the boundaries the only sin is to forget...

No more leaders of injustice

We have begun to realise potential far beyond our lies
To release the energy we have ignored for our own selfish greed
Ignorance inside the mind will be eradicated finally
Opening the doors to the rise towards impossibility
