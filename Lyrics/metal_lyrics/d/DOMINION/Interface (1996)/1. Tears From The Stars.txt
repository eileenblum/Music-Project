In the aura of time, ripped out of the blazing skies
Genesis of a new strain, the mother feeds her child

Silence broken, the birth of mankind, but the shadows conceal fears unspoken
Like tears from the stars

And the questions went unanswered among all it's people
Creation of a false belief he had to give his reasons
Like whispers in the ocean the words went unheard
Like tears from the stars the warnings went ignored

Like tears from the stars the mother feeds her child
Our search in life for our destiny, behold the grains that slowly drift away
Unforeseen fate will pale reality, in fears eclipse we'll hear the world 
while it weeps

Turn around and walk away, kiss the rose and let it die
But how many times have I fallen over waiting for my soul to feel the light

And the cup was taken from the hands of greed and misery
Evolution in time will bring forth the new breed
