This window to our so called lives, the worst drug known to mankind
Can't you see through the hollow vision that's right before your eyes?
Brainwashed by the fucking media, out of sight, out of mind

There is no truth, deceiving words, controlling vision, distorted perception

Is there a reason to survive, the monuments of instilled lies, the cage they 
have us all inside
The power of thought, they have the force, destroyed beliefs and altered 
course
Of life your mind has led you on

Do you not see through this charade
Your rightful judgment is to fade into the eyes of biased minds
Control the mass, unseen weapon, concealed deceit, subtract aggression
To conform and hold you down

We pay the price to suffer in this world, technologies domination has 
evolved up through time
Can't you see through the hollow vision that's right before our eyes?
Brainwashed by the fucking media, out of sight, out of mind
