Yearning for the dawn of the golden age, a new beginning, when will things 
change

The bleak winter is over and the ice starts to melt
A changing of the seasons, I have lost what I once felt

A pain that eats me inside, so far away from the outside
Redemption of our rapport, dissension continues to hinder

Let me be free. I wish to ride the storm, let the winds blow and the rain 
pour
Crimson sea take me, away from all the pain

Elapsing impulse of sentiment, bearing heart felt emotion tears
