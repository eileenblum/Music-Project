there's a sights in my mind turning as the wheels ov life the old days the old dreams even places still
inside
As none am burning through my past and memories ov those pains those shades even fear is deep in
mind
am alive in my past coz i can't bear to be me now..in this pain and loneliness am burning am just dying
Deep im my past iam alive in this life with my pain all alone
am alive in this reality and its just as a res nightmare to me and a fear of this life...
i am alone.....but not again...but i will die alone.....coz am insane in my past and my sweet memories
i will die to rest my soul ov agonies
let me die in past and the illusion am on my kneels lost in confusion i'v only on last solution suicide is
salvation in delusion
in my silence am yelling to die but i still dreaming ov that free new life far from pain and fear and that
lies although i know that i will still alone i know its only dreams past is just a memories...past is just a
memories..coz its just a memories
in this world nothing true just pain and lise and nothing given for free...am digging my eternal grave
through memories nothing left in this world for me
iam the pain iam the agony iam calling the death to take my pain away i won't to live again in this life
of suffering i want to die in peace with my memories
