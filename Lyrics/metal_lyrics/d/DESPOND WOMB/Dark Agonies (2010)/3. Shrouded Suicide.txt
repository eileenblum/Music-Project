oh my dark shroud snatcher ov my breath cover me in this night and hug me beneath oh my timbered coffin take all ov my pain conserve me ov cold nights till my corpse feeding grave's worm's
few minutes passed before i laid in this moist dark musty grave
few minutes passed before i saw my self laying on the ground
covered by blood and tears confused with all kind ov fears
holding a big prophecy droning in the last lullaby
sleep my child in this night sleep my child out ov the sights
sleep my child don't be afraid sleep my child don't wake again
there's no pain any more and am not sad or lorn
am not afraid ov fate my soul just crossed the gate
thousand years i cried to this feeling i realized
thousand years ov torture forsaken as anguished child
i want just the peace with no sorrow or grief but i now i just relieved my soul and we became one piece
we're free forever my soul and me together thinking about the never tomorrow will never.....come
