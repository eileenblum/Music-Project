there's no way for me to live as the do with them lies
there's a sickness in my mind there's no cure just to die
i ate ov my sensations ash that burned through my passion of past am the loser iam in fact
breathing pain
i lived my life a mope and listening to my soul moan but i can't take anymore of this shame
far away to rich a chunks ov my soul and broken life i'll wait the death to takes me away
retrospect mourning pandemic am falling am broken am insane through my past am dying
catastrophe disaster that i born in this world non human felt the pain burning my damn brain
iam slain ov pain am no more a sane iam tore in deep as a ship on tears am alone...in th dark
am alone
in the lake of past i sank my trust i beheld my self in the memories last....forever
i'v tried to find some hope in somehow by someone in this life
but no way to live in this world without a great pain coz its just created with lies.....
