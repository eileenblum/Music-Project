she still fighting with her sympathetic dreams through my demonic nightmares but useless to win useless to win through my demonic nightmares useless to gain through my suicidal nightmares
i still have your image in my mind smiling with a shining eyes ov bride your voice won't stop ringing inside and keeps me sleepless however i hide
u just borned though my great fantasize and u entered my nightmares with a spring soft breeze
i can't forget the lines ov your shape i can't deny the nimbus ov your shade i never thought that i'll find u but how i wish again to hold u don't leave me alone
i still waiting u in my dreams coz i can't forget the echoes ov your breath
in your appearance and when u disappear u'll always be in my great fantasize and a prisoner ov my broken heart ov dreams fighting with your sympathetic dreams
i still fell the tears ov light falling on my nightmares so bright drowning me
