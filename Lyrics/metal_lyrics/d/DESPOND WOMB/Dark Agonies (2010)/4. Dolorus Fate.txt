my heart still beating a pain and pumping a restlessness in my depressive veins and through
my loneliness..i still all alone in my abandoned realm on forsaken throne with a tragic smiles
upon my face waiting one coming certain death
there's a fracture in my dreams there's a shiver inside all the feelings i'v felt all the ppl i loved
there's a funeral in my mind for the orphaned child mourning for my past and joy coz i'll never
find..there's a corner deep insight ov grief and sorrow in my life..am standing there alone
scribbling walls ov fear and loss
love...forgotten...pain conquered memorise
frozen heart...growing malady...suffocated faith...chewed tragedy....damn fate...
sufferance community...i'll die alone
Iam the serenity ov the hopeless soulless soul
Iam the hope ov the empty wet illusion
sinking in tears collecting pieces ov dreams
lost in the dark feeding at my loneliness
trying to find a reason for emptiness
dying alone craving for deliverance
pain...memories..love...broken heart....malady...faith...tragedy...damn fate
faith is dead my dolorous fate....alone
