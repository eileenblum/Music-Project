[originally by Voivod]Dance for masters primitive full of colours offensive
I've just arrived like a flash in the dark my life has been lit up like a spark
They turn around the big fire they sing a song to get higher
I've just got here to find under-brains I'll watch their voodoo that starts the rain
Are there any forces are there two faces are there some chances

We've never seen that before it's what we've been waiting for
It just arrived to save our lives The Flying Lord the god of all time
Have no idea what it thinks but have no fear we trust it
It is the leader of our sacred wars came from the sky it rules so far
Are there any forces are there two faces are there some chances

They're searching for something something to believe in
Their convictions blood effusion is it a crime their convictions
Self-destruction at the right time their convictions exploitation under the sign
It's going to be more it's going to be war it's going to be
Who is the god who is the dog who is the dog
Who is god who is dog who is god who is dog
Who is god who is dog who is god who is dog
