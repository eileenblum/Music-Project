Come together as one, hate syndicate will lead
From the jaws of death, screaming our need to feed
Retribution dealt swiftly, it's death we're dealing
The blood on our hands, as the foe is reeling
Killing, slashing, bleeding dying, breathing, feeding

Come together again, the clan is growing stronger
Sonic stabs no mercy, the chain of hate is longer
Slashing blade that's us, is growing in strength
A chain of hate, that's binding, grows in length
Killing, slashing, bleeding dying, breathing, feeding

Live for today, see things our way, do as we say
Sense things our way, live in our way, do as we say
Sensing with us, seeing with us, hearing with us
Existing with us, breathing with us, killing with us we will lead
Joining with us, bleeding with us, feeding with us
Stronger with us, harder with us, darker with us
Killing with us, crushing with us, breathing with us
Smashing with us, tearing with us, devour with us
Confuse engage destroy we're your family engage destroy we're your family now
