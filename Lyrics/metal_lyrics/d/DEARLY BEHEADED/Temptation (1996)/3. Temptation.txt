Hold me in temptation's grip so I can taste, its living breath
Tempt me with another world so I may die, to be reborn, my friend
My God is high and so am I
Come smoke with me temptation's grip, temptation's grip

Tranquil sea wash over me I am calm and yet I drown
Submerged intense I heed the call reborn, inside temptation's grip, I swear
My God is high and so am I
Come smoke with me temptation's grip, temptation's grip

What I feel, now is burning what is seen, now is turning
Smoke with me, achieve your dreams tempter's grip has released me
My God is high and so am I
I am all, I understand I've achieved a tainted view
Break it down, the heart of things deep sensations, revelations, that's why
My God is high and so am I
Come smoke with me temptation's grip, temptation's grip
Smoke with me, achieve your dreams I am kind, I rule this world
Ride with me, inhale at will hold me tight, temptation's grip, I say 
My God is high and so am I
Come smoke with me temptation's grip, temptation's grip
