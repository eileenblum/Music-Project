[Japanese Bonus Track][originally by Deep Purple]I don't mind just what you say I never heard you never heard you anyway.
I don't care what you do just so long as it ain't me and you.
Sly like a demon's eye.

Everything's good, I said, everything's fine.
You don't know, don't know it's the end of your time.
How does it feel to be turned away I've known it almost every day.
Sly like a demon's eye.

I don't need you anymore,
I don't want you hanging round my door.
You slip and slide round my brain.
You think you're so clever but you know you're insane.
Sly like a demon's eye.

I don't mind just what you say.
I never heard you I never heard you anyway I didn't.
Everything's good, everything's fine.
You don't know it's the end of your time.
Sly like the demon's eye,
