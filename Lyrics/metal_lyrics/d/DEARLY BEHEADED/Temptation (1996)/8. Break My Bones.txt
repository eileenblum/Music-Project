You don't know what you are doing
Live in hope, keep on praying
You are lost in your own mind
The key to reason you cannot find

Well we're living in the world today
And we're living in the world in every way
Your hate won't break my self respect
Break my bones, but you can't break my soul
You try to take it all, but you cannot take control
You try to run us out, when you burn our homes
But you'll never break my pride when you break my bones
When you break my bones

You find the time, the place, the need
You're self-indulgent full of greed
With famine and war, your fascist views
You can plot your rise soon your demise

Anti-Semitism, racist attack
Violent protests, government backed
We are a family, we are a clan
A fragile earth, a simple plan

That is your path, this is our way
Watch with us as the world decays
You can't get a job, you're insecure
Stop it, join us for the future
