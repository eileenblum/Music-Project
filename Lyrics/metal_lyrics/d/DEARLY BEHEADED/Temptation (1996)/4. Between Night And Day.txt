I'm between night and day soon, believe what I say calm the madness in my soul
Help me to take control life just ebbs away caught between night and day

Between night and day soon, life ebbs away I believe it lay myself down to rest
Entwined within myself dreams run around my head I'm alive yet I'm dead

I believe it soon, I'm between night and day take my hand, my child
Walk with me awhile bring it on some more calm the madness in my soul

Between night and day between night and day
Between night and day life drifts away
Hell yeah, I'm leaving I'm leaving yes I am

Soon, between night and day twilight casts its rays
Here I end my days the life I live is done caught between moon and sun

I'm going soon between night and day, that's what I say the heart of a man in your soul
Remember a story once told as the twilight fades I close my eyes to end the days
