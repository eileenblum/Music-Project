An image staring through you reflections in my mirror
Of a man that could have been more than just a waste of time
I cross this land of fortune in a search for something more
Than these weak and helpless creatures who could dare to call me brother

Come and witness to my strength
Come and witness to my strength

Only those who know their own minds don't drift with fashions flow
Inner strength will block your view eclipse your dying sun
Strength of will can crush a nation and in time can build an empire
Read the books that I have written free will makes a man unique

Took hold of the cards that fate deals stood my ground while others ran
Marched alone into the cold wind fight oppression from the weak minds
Witness to this celebration of a strong and focussed man
Heed to the words I have spoken or cower in the shadows
