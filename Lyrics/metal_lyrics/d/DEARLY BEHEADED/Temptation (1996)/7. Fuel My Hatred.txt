Sitting here alone watching the TV images of death, destruction staring back at me
I take it in it all builds up inside of me bracing myself fuelled by the war upon the screen
I take this gun I'll do it for laughs it penetrates me just fuel my hatred

Waves of pain blinding my vision look around, what do you see
Enveloping hatred, washes all over me sucking me in, conforming to machines
I take this gun I'll do it for laughs it penetrates me just fuel my hatred

Wasting away under a knighted sky sometimes I think maybe I should die
In these times people are hard to trust take some away, God I think I must
Just fuel my hatred, just fuel my hatred
Wasting away, alone in my cell four foot by ten, no room my God can't you tell
Here I'll end my days, pacing around my victims haunt me, everyday
I take this gun I'll do it for laughs it penetrates me just fuel my hatred
I worked that gun I did it for laughs I'll do it again you fuelled my hatred
