A poor old fool, trapped within his mind
Speculation, I'm neither mad nor blind
If you could see what hides behind the sky
Intelligence defied

Power beyond time Hyborean and blind
The Eldrich reality horror of the ultimate
There's no rest no rest there's no rest, at the gates

For twenty years I've lived the hell of truth
Oblivious of your tiny world of lies
I've seen the worlds turn beyond your petty dreams
Awakening blasphemy, screaming

Terribly alone under a knighted sky
Crushing mass, the weight of space and time
I feel its presence, I hear it, with my eyes
Dormant sense of fear suppressed with mankind

Surround me and yet I see those shining stars
I look into its eyes and know just what I saw
Endless black infinity, eternal void
I felt the universe flow, a fulcrum of the stars
