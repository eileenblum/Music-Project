I am living in a dark, cold world just a scavenger
Like the rats at my feet who'd have thought it
I'm reduced to this living for nothing
Leaving them all behind leaving them all behind
Leaving them all be all behind

Feeling lonely on my concrete bed
Negative expression etched right across my face
An evil cold snatches warmth from my self a twilight fades
Leaving them all behind leaving them all behind
Leaving them all be all behind

Stop all your crying stop all your greed stop all your pain
Stop and take heed again stop all the dying
Stop all the rain once more here is a way out
Leaving them all behind leaving them all behind
Leaving them all be all behind

Intense people, faces are so blank live my own way
Never going to look back my friend I'm in the hands of fate
Lord knows what I'll gain today move so far away
Leaving them all behind leaving them all behind
Leaving them all be all behind
