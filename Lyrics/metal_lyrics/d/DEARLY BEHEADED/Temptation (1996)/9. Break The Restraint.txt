Dogs are turning, breaking their stride
Straining the leash, in keeping with their pride
Dogs are turning, they run on deadly ground
Baring their teeth, as they are freedom bound

Leash gets tighter, time for release
No oppression, as they search for peace
Leash gets tighter, biting deep into flesh
Tearing and biting, they take the last breath

Break the restraint break the restraint, break the restraint
Dogs on leads, dogs on leads, dogs on leads
Break the restraint strain the leash
Break the restraint dogs won't bleed

Break the restraint, held back for no longer
Stranglehold choke, now the dogs are stronger
Break the restraint, bite the hand that feeds
Dogs are turning, bite the hand of greed

Dogs are turning, breaking their stride
Straining the leash, in keeping with their pride
Dogs are turning, they run on deadly ground
Baring their teeth, as they are freedom bound
