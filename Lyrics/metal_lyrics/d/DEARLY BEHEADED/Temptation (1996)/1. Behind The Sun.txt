Dark ships sailing on a sea, that doesn't exist
Drifting away drifting deeper, into the abyss
Voices calling though if I bow my head, and turn away
They call to me in my world that doesn't exist
Behind the sun, behind the sun

Realms of chaos feel the tug it won't go away
Terrible injustice sadness weeps, from the worlds eye
Cry for help my heart is burning, for another love
In my mind, anger persists
Behind the sun, behind the sun

As we're living behind the sun as I walk away
Foetus to life creation begun, and image to man
Empty vessel information, all of it sublime
A growing hate in another place very safe
Solitude in darkness in my presence a child is born
Behind the sun, behind the sun

Dark ships sailing on a sea, that doesn't exist
Drifting away drifting deeper, into the abyss
Voices calling though if I bow my head, and turn away
They call to me in my world that doesn't exist
Live in darkness, worlds stop turning
Decay, where my body was burning
Walk with me, behind the sun 
Behind the sun, behind the sun
