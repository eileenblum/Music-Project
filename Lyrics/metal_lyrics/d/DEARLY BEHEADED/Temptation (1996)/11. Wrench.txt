[Japanese Bonus Track]Into a life, a screeching child a place I never wanted to be
Youthful fights, confrontations things that have happened to me
Try to grow up, best way I can it seems, so harder to see
In a world that I live is there going to be a place for me

Biding your time wrench life is sublime wrench committing a crime wrench
I draw the line live my dreams on my own terms
To burn the bridges behind throw it all to the wind my friend
Nothing ventured nothing is gained nothing ventured nothing is gained

Boy to man is a painful thing while parents find you something to be
I don't want this, please don't do this you don't seem to see
Wasting away in a sea of dismay alter egos, create
Find a solution for your problems I don't need this everyday

You are living on your own your world, your destiny
Doing something in your life the world I can see
You try to kick me when I'm down try to get through to me
Keep your jobs and normal lives just leave me to be me

Into a life, a screeching child a place I never wanted to be
Youthful fights, confrontations things that have happened to me
Try to grow up, best way I can it seems, so harder to see
In a world that I live is there going to be a place for me
