Pain filled screams still echo in the night
In the place where time stands still

Under the cold stare of pale moonlight
Something's waiting in the dark coldness

What lies beneath
What lies beneath the moor
What lies beneath
What lies beneath the moor

Every time when night falls down
In silence of the dead
You can hear them in your head

They're whispering your name and slowly driving you insane
They're playing with your mind... why?

Pain filled screams breaking through the time
In a place where time stands still

They're screaming your name and driving you insane
They're playing with your mind... WHY?
