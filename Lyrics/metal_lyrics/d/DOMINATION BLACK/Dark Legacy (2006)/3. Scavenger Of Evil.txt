It's waiting for the time to come
To strike without a warning
Faceless shadow crawling inside your mind
And eating everything what you left behind

Scavenger of evil

Like a devil in disguise
You can't see the truth before it's too late
It's hiding behind the lies
And slowly stealing your soul from the deep inside

Scavenger of evil

It's still waiting for the time to come
To spread the wings of eternal hunger

Scavenger of evil
