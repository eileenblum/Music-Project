Somewhere beyond the frontiers of reality
I see you standing in coldness
Deep in a secret place that time forgot

You're trapped in a world unknown
Where daylight is dead and gone
I see you waiting in the coldness
Down in a watery grave... so alone

In dark water dreams
Your calls haunt my sleep
In dark water dreams
Your cries haunt my sleep

Silent night, the devil's night
In my dark water dreams

Silent night, the devil's night
I see you reaching for the light
Silent night, the devil's night
I hear your screams of fright

In dark water dreams
