Through the years
Through the time
You ruled the kingdom of unholy lies
But now I see what's behind the mask of deception

Two faced devil
Two faced devil

Now time has come to the whole world to see
When your glorious life starts to bleed
No angel (of mercy) can save you now
Because your time's racing like wind

Nothing can save you now
You're going down
Nothing can save you now
You two faced devil

You try to run away
Away from your past
Your end is here to stay at last
It's too late to hide your face
(Because) You`re painted with your own shit

Nothing at all

Your past is driving you into the early grave
Fucker!
