They disappeared without a trace
In the darkest hour of the night
The grim secret baptized in blood
It's hiding down where the sun dies

Somewhere out in the darkness
Something cold is still waiting
Every time when light of the day comes down
Something comes alive... alive

They're crawling back to your world
When the night time... when the night time is here!

They're rising from the endless night
Back from the cold grave
They're shining in the endless night
They're coming after you... within the phantom light

They disappeared without a trace
In the darkest hour of the night
Beneath darkened trees
They were buried down to the hallowed ground

Somewhere deep in the silence
They're cursed by the nocturnal spell
Every time when the darkness kills the daylight
They'll rise... they'll rise
