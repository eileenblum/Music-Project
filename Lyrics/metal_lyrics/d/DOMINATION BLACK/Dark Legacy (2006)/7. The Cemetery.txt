Here I am waiting for you
In the dark place of my memories
It's been a long time since you disappeared
But I still hear you in the wind
Or am I dreaming...

A cold wind blows right through my mind
I feel you standing close to me
Now I return where we used to be
Back to the place that holds the key... to the past

Into the shadows
Into the silence of the cemetery
Into the shadows
Into the silence of the cemetery

That's where I'm waiting for you...

That's where we belong....
