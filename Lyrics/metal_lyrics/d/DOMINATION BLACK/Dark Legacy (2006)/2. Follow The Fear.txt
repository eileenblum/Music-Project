In your worst nightmares
Deep in your dreams
Something is closing you

No way to run
No place to hide
From the bringer of never ending night

Now the darkness surrounds you
The horror circus is here for you

Don't ever close your eyes
Never fall into sleep
Don't ever close your eyes
Because that's when your fears start to creep... closer and closer to you

In your darkest world made by yourself
Something is calling at you

You try to scream from the black
You're lost forever and never coming back

Never close your eyes
Never follow the fear

(because that's where I hide)
