Make my bad dreams go away
Or I won't make it through this night
I'm slowly drifting away from you
And never coming back again

Make the voices go away
They're getting louder every day
In my room where walls are closing in
I can't escape anymore... oh no!

Every night I wake up screaming
But you can't hear me at all
Every night I wake up screaming

Make my bad dreams disappear
Or I will never see the light of day
This time they're taking me away
Into the world of everscreams

Every night I wake up screaming
But nobody hears me at all
Every night I wake up screaming from my little nightmare world
