My hands are reaching out to you
You can feel the chill from the afterlife
Now I'm taking you back to the dark past
So you can finally see what you have done at last

My hands are pulling you down
Down to the place where all things happened
No chance to turn back the dead time
It was here where I died

Ghost of the nightfall
Among the dead I stand
Ghost of the nightfall
Among the dead I stand

Now you see what I am!
Now you see what I am!

Now you see what I am! (bitch)
