Dark illusions from haunted past
Piercing through your reality
Frozen shadows from the other side
Crawling out from the holloworld

Enter my darkness and feel my pain
In Fear Re-LoaDEAD

Silent voices from endless hate
Creeping back into your wicked mind
Retribution of blackened souls
Reaching out from the nameless grave

Enter my darkness and see my pain
In Fear Re-LoaDEAD

[1st solo: Markus Vanhala]

[2nd solo: Heiskanen]

Darkness is rising
You can`t run
Vengeance is calling
You can`t hide

Enter my darkness and feel my hate
In Fear Re-LoaDEAD
