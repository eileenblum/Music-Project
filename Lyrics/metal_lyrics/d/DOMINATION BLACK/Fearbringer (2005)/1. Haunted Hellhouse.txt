Step into the darkside
Into the lost world of the dark secret
Where deadly voices are calling... for you!
Out from the soultrap of the dead

Behind the silent walls
Something`s waiting for you
Lost in a cold - Like rats in a maze
...Trapped in the haunted hellhouse

Slowly death comes crawling
Away from the curse of the world unknown
Where deadly shadows are calling... for you!
Out from the silence of darkened ground

Behind the silent walls
Something`s waiting for you
Lost in a cold
In silence of grave... Shadows of haunted hellhouse

[Solo: Wiren]

Step into the darkside
Where no one hear your screams...

Behind the walls of eternal sleep
Something`s calling for you
Out from the cold - The call of the dead
...screams from the haunted hellhouse
