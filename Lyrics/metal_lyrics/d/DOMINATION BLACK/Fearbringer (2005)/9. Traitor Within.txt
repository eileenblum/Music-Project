Hatred burns in my soul
You can`t hide from the flames of hate
Inside your blinDEAD mind
It`s time to wake up from the dream

Open your eyes and see the traitor within your soul

Vengeance grows in my heart
You can`t hide from me any more
Inside tour weakened mind
I am your final fall from grace

Open your eyes and see the traitor within your soul
In your soul

[Solo: Wiren]

Vengeance shines through my eyes
Slowly burning you down with your lies

Open your eyes and see the traitor within your soul
In your soul
