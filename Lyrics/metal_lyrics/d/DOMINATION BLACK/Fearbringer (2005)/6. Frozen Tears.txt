Black sun is fading out from your memories
In the frames of endless sorrow
Shadows will disappear

Final day is dawning
Can you reach out to the light?
In edge of fallen darkness your fears are fading away

Frozen tears from the eyes of coldness
Frozen tears falling into the hallowed ground
Frozen tears from the eyes of coldness
Frozen tears falling into the hallowed ground of your soul

[Solo: Wiren]

Dark dreams are drowning, can you see through the past?
In frames of suffering your tears still remain
Down in a cold, Forever

Frozen tears from the eyes of coldness
Frozen tears falling into the hallowed ground
Frozen tears from the eyes of coldness
Frozen tears falling into the hallowed ground of your soul

[Solo: Heiskanen]

Frozen tears from the eyes of coldness
Frozen tears falling into the hallowed ground
Frozen tears from the eyes of coldness
Frozen tears falling into the hallowed ground of your soul
Frozen tears
Frozen tears
Falling down
