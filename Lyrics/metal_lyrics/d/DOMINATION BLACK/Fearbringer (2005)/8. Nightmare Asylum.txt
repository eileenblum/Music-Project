You`re lost in a world of deadly screams
Somewhere behind your dreams
In a cradle of the shattered minds
You can`t escape, You just can` t run

Sleeping in moonlight
Deep inside Your mind
Calling from the darkness
"Kiss you dreams goodbye"
In nightmare asylum

You`re locked in the black room of madness
Somewhere behind the stillness
In a grave of slaughtered souls
You`re buried alive into your fears

Sleeping in moonlight
Deep inside Your mind
Calling from the darkness
"Kiss you soul goodbye"
In nightmare asylum
In nightmare asylum

[1 st solo: Wiren]

Sleep well... In your silent hell

[2nd solo: Heiskanen]

Sleeping in moonlight
Deep inside Your mind
Calling from the darkness
"Kiss you soul goodbye"
In nightmare asylum
