Who can choose the evil from divine?
Who is the one to know your mind?
Who is the one to kill all the light?

He who rings the final bell
will condemn your soul to Hell
Torment for the cursed souls - 
torture in the darkest cell

Hollow screams of pain grind your ears
Waiting for your turn to step in
Running blood and falling tears

The final sight of a gloomy light,
The Devil's doorman, last gate-slam
There is no way for you to fight
No escape from the maniac man
Forevermore running through those doors
Dark angels call, they are yearning for more
(Oh no, it can't be so)

Who can choose the evil from divine,
who is the one to know your mind?
Who's the one to kill all the light?

Hollow screams of pain grind your ears
Waiting for your turn to step in
Running blood and falling tears
The demons' faces twist to grin
