Dreary lights shine in the endless night
Vicious creatures roaming by
Evil's always waiting in the end
The final order has been sent

Deceitful henchman from the deepest well
gives you a free ride straight to Hell
Gliding through the empty fields of pain,
darkest skies and pouring rain

Falling from grace through this maze
You are doomed forever
Fear grinds your face in this cursed place
No sanctuary evermore

Seeking havens, there's no place left to go
Torture's painful, always slow
No remorse, the force of evil roaming on
Run or flee - it won't be gone

Falling from grace in the darkest haze
You are lost forever
Fear grinds your face in this cursed place
No sanctuary evermore
