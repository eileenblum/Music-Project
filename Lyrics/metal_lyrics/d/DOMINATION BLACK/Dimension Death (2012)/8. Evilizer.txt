Where the air is cold as ice
You see a house in devil's light
Once you get inside you realise
That something isn't right

Keeper of the house is here
He'll make you burn in hellfire
With every step you sense him near
They call him Evilizer

O knew that there would be no turning back
From this mansion of evil
No escape and I'm trapped here all alone
Until the darkness shall be taking me

A coffin of creation
Bringing resurrection
With the insects rises death
A new life in the depth

Evilizer! (KILL!)
Evilizer! (KILL!)
