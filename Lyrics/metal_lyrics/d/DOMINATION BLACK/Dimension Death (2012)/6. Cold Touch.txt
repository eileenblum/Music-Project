You made me see things I don't want to see
In the dead of the night when all those eyes follow me
Night after night, I feel them passing by
Showing all the mystery ghosts from the frozen past

I shouldn't talk with the dead
No matter what I do I can't turn back the time
I shouldn't talk with the dead
No matter what I do they creep inside my head

I feel their cold stare when daylight is fading away
When no one hears when no one is around
Night after night, I slowly learn the truth
Nobody has returned from their frozen world

I shouldn't talk with the dead
No matter what I do, I can't end this game
I shouldn't talk with the dead
No matter what I do, they creep inside my head

So many years since I felt their presence
Now they're all crawling back to me

I shouldn't talk with the dead
No matter what I do I can't close the door
I shouldn't talk with the dead
No matter what I do they creep inside my head
