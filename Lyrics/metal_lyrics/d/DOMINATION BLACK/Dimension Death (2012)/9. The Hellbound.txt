Night's coming down
The snow is all around
Slowly turning red
They all are hellbound

Alone in the dark
Ready for a silent terror
You make them fear
The invisible objector

This is the war you created
Are you sure it's one that you wanted?
This is your hell and we made it
Be certain you will not escape from it

White striker in a tree
Is waiting, you can't flee
His bullet takes you down
Before you'll make a sound

The man without a face
Against the rolling war machinery
Pulls the trigger
Sending death through the enemy

Snowfall hides the deadly force
It's too late to turn the course
Though the blizzards of freezing hell
They hear the judgement bell
