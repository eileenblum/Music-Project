It's just the same again the same boring refrain
Awaken not, dream of a hell all new
Monolithany
There's no end to reprisal
Monolithany
Remain in hell
It's not the shedding hour it never comes
This is only life on infernal repeat
Vultures have more past than we will ever have
They rip and tear the dead we just throw them away
