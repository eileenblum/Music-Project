All that cannot be named the sweeping pest of dreams feverish yet so real
Sill never to flesh again
I know you know it that familiar dread I know you fear it
It comes to you in dreams and make you shiver
That sick which has no point which only dwells inside to wreak its twisted havoc
Upon your trembling soul
These dreams without end that last forevermore
These dreams without end starts this night
The depths of utter hell, inside your very being
Aeons countless converging into your soul
