Indifferent to the process it still creates indifferent to the outcome it sill
Operates this wheel of doom and perpetual sickness turn

I deem you demiurg lord of abominations

And through forever it spews its sick the primitive machinery
Perpetual breeding ground of disease the primitive machinery
