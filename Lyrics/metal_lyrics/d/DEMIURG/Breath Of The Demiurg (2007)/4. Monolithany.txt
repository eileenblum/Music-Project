The shedding never came from larva to nothing more
Embryonic pains remain to struggle all too soon

Monolithany
The eulogy of nothing more than waste

Caught inside the wheel and the wheel never stops
Monotonous reprisal of all that never was but pain
Such squandered hours all gone just like the years
Such misery building up to feed the insanity
