A thousand years has passed such wealth and golden reign
A time of growth and no pain a thousand years has gone
Such wealth and golden lies that time of growth amount to nothing but doom

In towers once so stern upholding wisdom
Where knowledge was enthroned they laugh as jesters

A thousand years did pass and then came doom
To sweep away the filth festering the soil
Weeded from the ground torn away to give place for life
Slaughtered no lays man cast to death for conjuring only spew
