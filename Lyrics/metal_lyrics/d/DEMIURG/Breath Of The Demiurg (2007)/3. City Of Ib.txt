For aeons countless in the city of Ib what dwelt and bred, in the city of Ib
Since aeons countless in the city of Ib what was slain and bled, in the city of Ib

A breed descending, as old as moon and air
Channelled by a vortex radiant as any star
On shores unwalked unparallelled through aeons perfecting its unknown ways
Indifference will conjure death upon the shores of Ib

Carnal beings semimasters inhabitants of knowledge vast
In their stone and towers the unknown still grows below
Beneath the monolith giving head to the waning moon
This breed of beings sprung from a world afar

And then came death
Atrocious destruction
The filth of human hate
And carnage stain
