Encourage me to utter out 
thousand names for these warped whores
My indbred offsprings I am to worship
once I've lowered my gored spear

With my seed I shall breed pestilence
that shall fester in all of my creations
May my blood run through their veins
like toxic torrents, corroding and putrifying

Vesture my young with indignity
Garments of feces for my icons
Drape them all in such defilement

Every newborn trembling spawn
has it's price to get raped and slain
Bless them all with what they desire
Bless them all! Bless them all!

Tatter the veil, bind their limbs
Throbbing eager, carnal chasms
Sacks of pus and bottled up bile
bursting from their brittle seams
Ready to spew rotten innards 
on expecting disciples below
Putrid lifeblood, seed and ichor
Baptism for my, horde of harlots

Let loose my faithfull
Show me that you are worthy
Drown yourself in the depths of flesh
become one with your 
sovereign master

I'll be ready when I crown my next consort
To exercise my right to decimate
that which I have previously created
