I am sanctified by hunger
by abysmal urge
Constantly provoked
and perpetually fed
by fragments 
of endless chaos

In this emptiness there is nothing
but the ever craving void
and the throes of the dying
ideals and beliefs

Long gone tortured images
shifting like molten led

May my eyes
witness these abominations
May they show me
how to unlock their chains

May I free their 
siblings from my frail husk
May they burst my body asunder
and force me to meet their gazes
so that I might feed in your darkness
so that I might radiate fornication

May I carry my corpus with pride
May I covet for worldly possession
May I bathe in inmpure pleasures
May my wrath be without an end
May I gorge on flesh and wine
May I possess what I desire
May I relinquish from practice of virtue

May my hunger never be sated
