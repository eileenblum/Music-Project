My disgust is boundless
for I detest all weaknesses
Some because they are born from ignorance
Others because they are tolerated
Refusal to treat them 
with the scorn that they deserve 
is the sole reason
for my spite against all mankind

My ire is endless
for I loath all delusions 
Some because they are exalted
Others because they are fed by man
Refusal to treat them
with the scorn that they deserve
is the sole reason
for my spite against all that is sacred

May my vessel 
portray your worst vices
Let my image reflect
transgressions that surround me

For I am possessed by unholy volition

I am the altar 
for your craven idols
Entities portraying 
your worst fears 
Risen from
forgotten ravines
that were intentionally
kept uncharted

For I am but a temple for the unknown 

Quem in templo invenist
In hora mortis nostrae

Me tibi commissum pietate superna;
(Hodie, Hac nocte) illumina, custodi, rege, et guberna.

Him whom thou didst find in the temple
At the hour of our death
Ever this day be at my side
To light and guard
To rule and guide

Me tibi commissum pietate superna;
illumina, custodi, rege, et guberna.
