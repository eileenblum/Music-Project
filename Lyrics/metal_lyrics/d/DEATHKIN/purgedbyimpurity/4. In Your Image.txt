Let my twitching vessel
Claw its way out 
From the smoldering ruins 
of my holiest of temples

Oh most glorious 
of malediction
Let my earthly desires	
Serve as my shrines of worship
This withering body 
I hand over for you to desecrate
Just to be built a new
in your image

May your commendation
be my flesh's undoing
It's resistance is futile 
For somehow I always knew
that in my petty sanctums
your power has lingered
spawned beyond recognition
yet omnipresent in all of its glory

As a blazing furnace may my world remain
Forever in warfare with my flesh and soul
Rain down every of your blights upon me	
So that I may spread them as my blessings

May your haunting visions
Forever torment my waking hours
May your nightmares
Forever plague my restless sleep

I am the twisted image
of my lords changing will

May there be no shelter
From your inflictions
May my shackled flesh 
Forever serve as your dying host

I am the maelstrom
Conflict without an end
An evershifting cavern
Collapsing upon hope

I am the twisted image
of my lords changing will
who I found in my temple
at the hour of my end
Ever this day be at my side
To light and guard
To rule and guide

May chaos follow in my every footstep
Let it distort all laws that I respect
Everything that my heart holds dear
Shall be carved into an idol of it's own demise

May there be no shelter
From your inflictions
May my shackled flesh 
Forever serve as your host

May your haunting visions
Forever torment my waking hours
May your nightmares
Forever plague my restless sleep

This fleeting realm of putrid life
My only crumbling cathedral
This world I see in hues decayed
My festering flesh at its own wake
