I am electric heroin
I m your silent scream
I am the pill
They use to fill
Your suicide machine

Only for you
Only for you

I am a digital circus freak
My fifteen minute fame
I am the nail 
Pushed through the cross
Against your mortal frame

Only for you
Only for you

Powertrip with me
Powertrip with me
Powertrip with me

I am a corporate Jesus freak
Forced down to my knees
Best that I believe in God
Does God believe in me

Powertrip with me
