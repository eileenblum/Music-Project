Cry for Tomorrow
Cry for the sad
Cry for the grieving
For what you never had
Cry for the hate
Cry for the greed
Cry for tomorrow
Cry for the need

Cry for your sorrow
Cry for the death
Cry for yourself
Cry for all your regret
Cry for tomorrow
Cry for today
Cry for this moment
Slowly drifting away
Cry for the hate
Cry for the greed
Cry for tomorrow
Cry for the need

Never cry for me
