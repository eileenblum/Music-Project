Can you fill this emptiness  inside
Can you share the secrets that you hide
Trying to find 
A friend to end my pain
The faces change
But the feeling stays the same

You
I need you
I need you

I ve walked the longest mile of life alone
Loneliness is the oldest friend I ve known
Will an angel fall for me someday
When I see her spread her wings
She just keeps on flying

You
I need you
I need you

I need a friend I can run to
Someone to crawl inside
Someone to share my secret fear
Someone who hurts as much as I

I can t believe that I can be so blind
That such a simple thing is so hard to find

You
I need you
I need you
