I have fallen for you
Through the crack that breaks my life
You re the sunlight of my day

I have waited so long
Just to find someone like you
Now you take it all away

You ve taken a part of me
I ve been without so long
One bullet could set me free
One shot and the deed is done

Remember me this way

I m at quite a loss now
To convey the way this feels
Like the hurt will never heal
So I cut the wires
All communications down
All communications down

You ve taken a part of me
I ve been without so long
One bullet could set me free
One shot and the deed is done

How does it make you feel
To see me in this way
Or do you feel at all

You ve taken a part of me
I ve been without so long
One bullet could set me free
One shot and the deed is done

Remember me this way
Remember me
