[bonus track]

Voices whisper in my ear
They take me so far away
Take away my fear
Make it disappear

Everything I ve ever wanted to know
I thought by mistake that I d understand anything
So into the spiral cathedral we go
A promise of something just slightly out of reach

Crash the waves upon the shore
How come the rain has to fall
Someone waits behind the door
How simple words taken wrong destroy

Hearing a voice 
Of someone I can t find
Speaking in words
That come from inside
Waiting for so long
To find what I can t hide
Calling me
Come into the light

Once we begin
All of us fall to the wind
Turning and spinning and spiraling
Echoing on
Turning and twisting and spiraling
Soon to be gone
To the other side
The dreamscape
Home
