Before you know
Tomorrow s a memory gone by
And on the floor
Lies a note you never read
And you wait another day

Life has given
Nothing I can say
That it cannot take away

Before you know
All the cracks in the walls have grown
And when you go
Will you leave just a photograph
With a phony faded smile

Life has given 
Nothing I can say
That it cannot take away

When I look all around
I feel like breaking down
Under the weight of my stone
