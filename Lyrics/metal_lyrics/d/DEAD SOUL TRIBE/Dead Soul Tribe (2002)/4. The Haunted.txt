When I m alone now
I can feel you watching me

Haunting me

Somebody comes to me
In my sleep

I hear you breathing
Feel your mouth against my ear
You got a hold on me
Your icy fingers
Cold as stone are touching me
As I forsake all fear

Somebody walks with me
Across this stony ground
Somebody talks to me
And I know I can feel you
When you re coming `round

When I surrender
Haunted by the soul of you
I feel you disappear

Don t run away from me
Cause I know what it feels like
When somebody let you down
