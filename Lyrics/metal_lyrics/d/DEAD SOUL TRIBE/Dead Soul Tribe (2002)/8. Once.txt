Once 
I was strong
Now I see
I was wrong
What I need
All along
I ve received
Now it s gone

Once 
You were here   
And I wanted you near
Now I ve made
What I ve feared 
Now I ve made
What I feared

You keep me wanting you

When I think of you
I wish that you were here
Every now and then 
I dream about you my dear
I d tell you my regret would never disappear
If I could see you once again

Once 
I believed
Now I feel so deceived
That I should  be relieved
That our love is bereaved

You keep me wanting you 

When I think of you
I wish that you were here
Every now and then 
I dream about you my dear
I d tell you my regret would never disappear
If I could see you once again
