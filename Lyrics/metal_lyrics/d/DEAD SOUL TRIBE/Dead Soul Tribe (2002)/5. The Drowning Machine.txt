I ve  given up on life
There s nothing I can do
I m loosing faith within myself
Loosing faith in you

Is there no one here
No one near
Terrified inside my dear
I m lonely and I fear

I m crying for so long
Thought I d never make it through
Everything that I have sacrificed
I have given up for you

Is there no one here
No one near
Terrified inside my dear
I m lonely and I fear
