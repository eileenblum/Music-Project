We're flying on the wings of faith
We're flying on the wings of faith
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

We're gliding on the winds of change
We're gliding on the winds of change
We're flying on a daydream
The world is not what it seems
Cause nothing ever stays the same

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
We're gliding on the winds of change

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I want to hear you call my name
