Light is glowing
Faintly showing
Burning like candle to light our way

Wind is blowing
Strong and growing
Trying to douse the flame
So darkness can prevail

Earth is turning
Slowly burning
No one learning history repeats itself

Hate can only create more hate
Hate can only create more hate

Flags are waving
Madmen raving
Jesus saving no one
So save yourself

Bullets raining
Blood is staining
Try explaining why we have come to this

People dying
Screaming, crying
No denying freedom
Does not exist

Bombs exploding
Guns unloading
Stones we're throwing
Fall to the killing field

Hate can only create more hate
Hate can only create more hate
Hate can only create more hate
Hate can only create more hate
