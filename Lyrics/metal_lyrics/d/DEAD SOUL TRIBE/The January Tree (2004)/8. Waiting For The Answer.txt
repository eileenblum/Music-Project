Angels of desolation
Smile of cold blue cheer
Bullets are falling from your wings

Sons of the desecration
Phantoms of all my fear
Blood on the hands of modern kings

Waiting for the answer
Waiting for the answer
Spiders that haunt the cradle
Pick at the bones of my mind
Thrusting their venom to my spine
Caught in a world descending
Lost in the darkest of all times
And when the reign has ended light will brightly shine

You try searching but you never find
You might try looking inside

Take it all away
Help me find a new day
Take it all away
Can't we find a better way

Death on the wing ascending
Saints of a wicked faith
Cast a spell on all the world

Take it all away
Help me find a new day
Take it all away
Can't we find a better way

Waiting for the answer
Waiting for the answer
Waiting for the answer
Waiting on forever
