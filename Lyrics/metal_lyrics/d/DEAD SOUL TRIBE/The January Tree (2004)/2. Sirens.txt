Hearing sirens rush away
Fear inside of me
Tearing down my innocence
Scream their mad confession

Hear the silence deafening
Hear the flies descend
Turn and face my enemy
Twist the knives of vengeance
Feel the silence penetrate
Deep inside of me
In my sanctuary
All my fears, are vanquished

Something inside of me
Fighting me
Just won't let me go
Tearing me, biting me, spiting me
Don't let it show
Can you hear the madness, the sadness
Can you make it go
Can you hear the voices, the choices
They crawl from below

Hear the silent symphony
Hear the silent symphony
Hear the winding sound
Hear the winding sound

Can you hear the madness, the sadness
Won't let me go
Can you hear the voices, the choices
The silent rage

Something inside of me
Some thing dividing me
Haunting me
Calling me
Clawing me
