Lies
Only lies
Spoken by runaway eyes
I don't hear what they say
When they talk this way
Though they say everything twice

Spiders and flies
We're caught in a web and we're eaten alive
Spiders and flies
We're caught in a web and we're eaten alive

Earth is shaken
God forsaken
Paradise was overtaken
Smiles are faking
Lives are taken
Till the sleeping eyes awaken

Defy and deride
All in the name of our pride
Earthquakes and hurricanes
Wind and endless rains
Always the Earth will abide

Spiders and flies
We're caught in a web and we're eaten alive

With a smile they hope you believe in the lie
With a smile they hope you believe in the lie
When they talk this way
Leave the world this way
And they try to say I'm the one out of my mind
When we walk away
Give it all away
I am caught in a web and I am eaten alive

Spiders and flies
We're caught in a web and we're eaten alive
