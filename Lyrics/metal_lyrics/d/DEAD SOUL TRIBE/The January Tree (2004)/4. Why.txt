Blindfolds and cigarettes
Black hoods and camcorders televise homicide
Soldiers in shallow graves
Martyrs and thought police waiting to take you away

Why don't you let it lay
Won't you walk away
Let it end today
Why don't you let it go

Land of democracy
Land of hypocrisy
Forced down our throats, the indescents of pleasure
While violence and war deemed appropriate measures

Land of morality
Hand of brutality
Kill on command over corporate profit
Don't let them send you away

Why don't you let it lay
Won't you walk away
Let it end today
Why don't you let it go

And we have such a long way to go
But we've taken the wrong way to go
There's one thing i want you to know
There is something they don't want to show

Why don't you let it lay
Won't you walk away
Let it end today
Why don't you let it go
