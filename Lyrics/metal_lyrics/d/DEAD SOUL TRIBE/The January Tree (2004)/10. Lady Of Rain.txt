When we walk away
Come the day that we're leaving here
We can stop and stay on the way
We can leave our fear

Lady of rain
Will we regain or decline
Lady of rain
Where is the sweet Summer wine
It falls from the vine

Where we're going to
Everything's waiting for you
What we're going through
I believe must be untrue

Lady of rain
Will we attain the divine
Lady of rain
Where is the sweet Summer wine
It falls from the vine

If you only knew what I do
You'd have no fear
If you only knew what's inside of you
It'd all be so clear

Lady of rain
Will we remain on the line
Lady of rain
Will we attain the divine
Or fall from the vine
