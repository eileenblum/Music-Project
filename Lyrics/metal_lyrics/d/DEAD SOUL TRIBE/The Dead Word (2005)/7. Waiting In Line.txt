In search of something
I hope to find
Could be the one thing always on my mind
To find the key to
Unlock this chain
To break away but somehow I remain
With such a hunger
In such a pain
I'd like to cry but somehow I refrain
Your eyes are saying
You feel the same
You'd like to fly but
Somehow you're restrained

Waiting in line
Waiting in line
Wasting away my time
Waiting in line
Waiting in line
And I'm still on the outside now

Within my heart
And in my dreams
I have no use for all these shiny things
To seek our fortune
In all that gleams
We fill the world with walking dead machines

Waiting in line
Waiting in line
Wasting away my time
Waiting in line
Waiting in line
Still on the outside

Thirsting, needing, hurting, pleading cries
And it's turning, reeling, burning me inside
Cursed to bleed in burden, greed and pride
When the voices speak the truth to spread the lie

Waiting to die
Waiting to die now

To break the spell
Cast on this Earth
Look to your heart and find what life is worth
