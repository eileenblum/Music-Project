On the day I die
Don't pray for me
Soulstealer

In the place I lye
Set me free
Soulstealer

Take your crosses from my grave
All the tokens of your faith
Far from me

When the voices of the saints
Call to send me on my way
Don't you let them speak for me

Like the ocean turns to rain
I will come back to reclaim
My space of love
Where I will rise again

Take me to the place where I belong
Take me to the grace we've fallen from

On the day I die
Don't you let them pray for me
