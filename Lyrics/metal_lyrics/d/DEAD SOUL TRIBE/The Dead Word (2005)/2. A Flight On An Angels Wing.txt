Come to me and leave your fear
Come with me and follow near
So Tired of the lies they laid upon you
Open your eyes, then you will see
Try to realise
Don't believe any more corporate advise
On your TV

Come with me my friend

Come with me and clear your mind
Come and leave your world behind you
Never too late to change your direction
Don't be afraid, you wont walk alone
I'm gonna take a flight on an angels wing
Far and away
She'll carry me, carry me home

Come to me when the sirens sing
With the cry of a world gone insane
This sadness and this fear
Was not meant to be here
But the feeling has come over me

Taker, desecrater
Shaker, sorrow maker
Nation decimation, democration, desolation coming
