Haven't I gave it all for you?
Haven't I paid enough for what you say and what you do?

I've found the way
I've found the way
I'd love to take you to my world

Haven't I waited long for you?
Haven't I waited long for you?
Haven't I played my song,
Prayed so long for something new?

I know the way
I'm on the way
I'd love to take you to my world
