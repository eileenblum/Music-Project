Often Guests forget their things
Leave their hats, their coats and rings
Other people leave their stains
Leave their shadows leave their pains

Some people leave their bones
Some things you can't return

The shadows people leave behind
Eventually you're bound to find
Something you may never see
Still it haunts your memory

Some people bring their stones
Never take them home
Things you can't return
Some people leave their bones
Some things you can't return

Houses have a memory
Houses have a memory
The more you carry in
The more you leave behind
The more you carry in
The more you leave behind

And what you leave behind
Some things you can't return
