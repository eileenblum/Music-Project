[Bonus Track]

..I am here. I am waiting. Now I Fear. What I'm Waiting for. I can see. Far as Heaven.
Still I seem. Blind to what's been going on. I've been waiting for too long.
Time can feel, unforgiving. I can see. Only yesterday. Why can't we,look to the future?
Where we'll be. Will tomorrow ever come? 
I've been waiting for too long. I've been waiting for too long. 
Now my life like a cigarette burning down the side.
While the days one by one all passing by. And the time is slowly winding down.
I am here. I've been waiting for too long. Time never sleeps. Ever drifting. I can't keep.
It's safe and locked away. Just like sand through my fingers. It slips on by.
Forever rolling on. I've been waiting for too long. I've been waiting for too long.
