I'm not waving to you
I'm drowning
And I hope for you to see
I'm not waving to you
I'm drowning
So why you waving back at me

I'm so tired of fighting the waves
I feel like going down
So desperately trying to be saved
Lend that hand your waving 
Pull me aground

As I'm calling out to you
I wonder
Why my cry ain't getting through
Then a thought came to me
As I'm going under
Maybe you were drowning too

I'm caught in a tide of dismay
That I cannot defy
There's something you're trying to say
Now I know you're waving
Waving goodbye 

So many waves
So many waves
So many hands are waving
So many hands are pulling me down

Below
My tears
Raining so long
Keep on crying
Keep on crying

Keep on rising
Keep on rising
