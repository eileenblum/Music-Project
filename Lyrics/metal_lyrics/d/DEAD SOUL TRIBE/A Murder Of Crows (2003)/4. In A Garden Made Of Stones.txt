I'd like to tell you something
If you would take my hand
Close your eyes
And you will understand
Searching for the answer
I'd like to know
When I climb so high
How come I feel so low

In a garden made of stones
In a garden overgrown
We are lost inside a maze
And it don't lead nowhere

We walked away from Eden
Put Heaven in the sky
Put angels on the houses
That the devil lives inside

I Stood up on the mountain shouting
But you didn't hear
Climbed down again
To whisper in your ear
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you mean
No one listening
No matter how you scream

In a garden made of stones
All together all alone
We are lost inside a maze
And it don't lead nowhere

Every step I'm taking
Shadowed close behind
By all that I've forsaken
And all that I will never find
A time for every season
Time for every season
There's a time to walk away
There's a time to turn around and fight

Without a sound
A streaming flash of light
Tears the garden down
Try to put things right
Should we never learn
This maze would have no end
When we pick up the pieces
And build it back again

In a garden made of stones
In the garden we have grown
We are lost inside a maze
And it don't lead nowhere

Go on and sleep tonight
Go on and sleep tonight

We walked away from Eden
Put Heaven in the sky
Put angels on the houses
That the devil lives inside
