So many days
Through endless nights
Reciting verse of Revelation
By firelight

He loaded up his gun
And smiled to everyone
They won't be taking us alive

Trust in me

The people gazed
Into the sky
The mother ship that's headed for Heaven
Soon passing by

They'll fly us to the Sun
He smiled to everyone
They won't be taking us alive

Trust in me

Nothing's gonna come
Deliver everyone
If you waited a lifetime

Waiting for the day
To wash it all away
You'll be waiting your whole lifetime
