Another day tonight will bring
Like morning sky through ravens wings
With black smoke and mirrors
The corner of your smile has drawn me to your gaze

A miles away smile

The crows are passing overhead
A whisper from an angel said
That from the teeth that hide beneath the smile
That kissed upon my throat 
Have bled me all the while

A miles away smile

The worlds only promise is change
My hope is that something remains
Something forever
Something that never
Comes 'round and goes 'round again
Something my heart really understands
Something within

A whisper to a wishing well
A secret from tomorrow fell
Told me there's a time for everything
I tried to stop the rain
I prayed for you to bring
