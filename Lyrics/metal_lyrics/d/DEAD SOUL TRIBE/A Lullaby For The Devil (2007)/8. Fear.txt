Now we're staring at the water
Through a window from the sky
As the hands of the clock
Count away the day
Sun light softly glows
Do you know that I fear this ride?
Even though that is why I'm still alive
Do you know?

Every time I say good bye
I feel so all alone
But I know
I'll be coming home

I'm taking a ride on a carousel
I've tossed a coin in a wishing well
I'm taking a ride on a carousel
And it keeps on turning

Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world

Now we're staring at the mountains
Through a window on the highway
Like the picture in a hotel
Ever changing
Still somehow much the same
Do you know that I fear this ride?
I know that it's why I'm still alive

I'm taking a ride on a carousel
I've tossed a coin in a wishing well
I'm taking a ride on a carousel
And it keeps on turning
