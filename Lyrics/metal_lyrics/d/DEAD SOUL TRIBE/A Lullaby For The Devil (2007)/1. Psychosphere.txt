Break the cycle
Shake the cage of fear
Break the cycle
In the psychosphere

Cold
You've got to be cold
Cold
You've got to be cold
Somehow you've got to be told

Close the circle
No protection here
Close the circle
In the psychosphere

Laughter echoes through the silence
Cold compassion
Subtle violence

Cold
You've got to be cold
Cold
You've got to be cold
Somehow you've got to be told

Break the cycle
Fade and disappear
Break the cycle
In the psychosphere
