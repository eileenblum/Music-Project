Symptom of my vision
Shadow in my head
Ghost of my religion
Scars from where I bled
Further down and further down the spiral as we fall
Further down and further down the spiral
One and all

How can our decisions
Lead to our disgrace
Cause such great collisions
Cause our bitter fate
Tell me when
We'll rise again
From our eternal fall
Further down and further down the spiral
One and all

And this life is slowly melting
Like a candle burning

Like the architect
Who built himself behind a wall
Further down and further down the spiral
One and all
