A heart is so easy to break
The way that it feels can be so hard to take
When the love in your life
Is like turning a knife in yourself

A promise is easy to make
A promise believed can be quite a mistake
When you feel so deceived
That you can't believe anyone else

Did you ever care for some one
Like sticking your mouth to the end of a gun
Did you ever care for some one
Loosing yourself for the love of another one

If you really care for me
If you're really there for me
Well kiss me goodnight and then
Bring all this pain to an end
I'm so lost in you

Nothing is easy they say
All you've received can be taken away
And the more you believe in
The more you're deceiving yourself

Words can be so hard to say
Love is so easily frightened away
When you try hard to fly on the wings made of somebody else

Did you ever care for some one
Like sticking your mouth to the end of a gun
Did you ever care for some one
Loosing yourself for the love of another one

I'm so lost in you
I'm so lost in you
So lost in your eyes
I'm so lost in you
I'm so lost in you
So lost in your smile
I'm so lost in you
Can't breathe without you
I'm so lost in you
So lost in you
So lost in you

Did you ever care for some one
Like sticking your mouth to the end of a gun
Did you ever care for some one
Loosing yourself for the love of another one

If you really care for me
If you're really there for me
Well kiss me goodnight
And then put out the light in my head
If you're really there for me
Just say a prayer for me
Well kiss me goodnight
And just leave me right here for dead
I'm so lost in you
