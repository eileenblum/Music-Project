The sights of the city are blinding me
With everything I can see
Street signs and telephone lines
Traffic lights

The crowds on the sidewalk rush by me
While they go where they have to be
And the feeling is so uptight
None of it seems right

Good bye city life
Good bye city life
Good bye city life

Look at you
Where you going to
Do you find that piece of mind that you're trying to
Deep inside of you
So you thought that you're feeling too cold
Down, feeling down with your face to the ground
You save for tomorrow, but today
You throw it away, throw it away
Start to think nothing you hold to is real
Save for tomorrow, but today
You throw it away, throw it away
Hammer the tower to the floor
Wait for the men to come knock at your door
Come to tell you to stand up and to fight for the cause

It's just part of the whole design
They're trying to break your mind
Good bye city life
Good bye city life
From the way that our lives begin
They're just trying to keep you in
Good bye city life

Good by city life

Can we turn out the light
Can we please turn out the light
Let's turn out the light

Tow the world turns around on you
Turning round
Turning round
The machine is slowing down on you
Slowing down
Slowing down
