Everybody's looking for a sign
All their lives they search far and wide
Everyone is trying to find
Something they can't define
Something waiting quietly inside
Keep on trying

Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
Waiting
Waiting

Everybody wants to heal their pain
Everybody wants to end this fear
But they keep on waiting while they
Look up to the empty sky
Far away for something that's so near
Keep on waiting

Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
Waiting
Waiting

Everyone is waiting
All the dreamers keep on dreaming
For a sign
Any sign at all
All you dreamers keep on dreaming
For any sign at all
Any sign at all
Any sign at all
Any sign at all

I don't want to live this life again
All this pain and strife
This suffering
And I refuse to loose my mind
Drowning in this sea of time
Waiting for the next one to begin
All you dreamers keep on dreaming

Don't you see the sign?
Don't you see the sign?
Don't you see the sign?
Don't you see the sign?
Don't you see the sign?
Don't you see the sign?
Don't you see the sign?
Don't you see the sign?
