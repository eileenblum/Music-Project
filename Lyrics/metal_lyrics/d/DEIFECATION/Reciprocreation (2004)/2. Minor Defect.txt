For want of care and sympathy
the child shall suffer horribly
Bruise its limbs or get it burned
in the nice hot bath for which it yearned

Let the dog chew on its feet
'till it looks like minced meat
Not the first time it gets harmed
and the doctor seems alarmed

Malignance and ignominy
for want of care and sympathy
Force it rotten food to digest
the lack of attention I detest

Push the pram off the stairs
with painful eyes to me it stares

People rushing to comfort me
The child's agony makes me happy

The child shall suffer horribly
I've got Munchhausen's By Proxy
