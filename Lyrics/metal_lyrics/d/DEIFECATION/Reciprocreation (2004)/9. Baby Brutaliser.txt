Carving up the young woman's belly
to rip out the unborn child
Almost fullgrown little baby
good enough to brutalise

Hacking up the tiny torso, piece of shit
Peeling it like an onion
Gobbling gutted feeble young
Draining snotted bowels
makes me almost choke

Dumped the little bugger
hollowed and disemboweled
somewhere in a dumpster
Going home, its mother is still there
she's so open to me,
I can read her like a medical handbook

I sew her shut with iron thread
and make out with her a couple of times

What a pity, nothing will be born
I think she is missing her breeding tools

Silently I sneak through the streets at night
on my way to the hospital and break into the maternity ward

The next day, the newspaper headlines scream:
"SICK FREAK ON THE RUN - MUST BE STOPPED AT ALL COST"

Storing of infants in my cellar
Reeking like four months old
minced meat in the sun
Caressing my olfactory organ,
slowly melting my infested brains

Carving up the young woman's belly
to rip out the unborn child
Almost fullgrown little baby
good enough to brutalise

Brutalise, brutalise, brutalise

Babybrutaliser
