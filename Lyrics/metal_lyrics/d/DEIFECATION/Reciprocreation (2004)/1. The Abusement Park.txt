Faithful to the firm for years
amongst the best of engineers
He diligently applied his trade
for well over a decade

His labour bargain sucked ass
as bad as nothing could surpass
It had been years since he had had a raise
because he was considered base

He went to his stone cold manager
a fucking bitch that makes you want to strangle her
to discuss his mediocre compensation
but instead he got contract termination

This was the thing he didn't expect
On a stake he wanted her to erect
Suddenly he had a much much better idea:
the park will be turned into carnage plaza

In his remain working time
Setting up his hideous crime

Nuts and bolts were screwed untight
Massive agony shall be ignite
Working hard to the climax
In trusses appear little cracks

Life dangerous the rods are now rusting
As a prelude to the mass child bashing

The high season has now arrived
In mangled bars and rods the kids will be gyved
According to his precise calculation
a happy day will  turn into obliteration

It started with rollercoaster rampage
filled with youngsters under age
Buckling of beams due to sabotage
landing a half a mile away for a concrete massage

Almost simultaneously inside the haunted house
A skeleton with a sharp axe arose
When a cart filled with kindergarten kids came along
Swinging fast and repetitive, the place looked like a game of mahjong

Nuts and bolts were screwed untight
Massive agony has now been ignited
According to his precise calculation
a happy day has now turned into obliteration
