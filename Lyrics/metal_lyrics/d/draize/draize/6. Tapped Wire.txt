That joke isn't funny anymore
Too close to raided homes and broken bones

Joe Sly is not half as dumb as we like to think
Shoot yourself in the foot, leave a trail they will follow

Whatever you say they are rolling tape
Creeping in the shadows waiting to infiltrate

In this new era of ultimate control
we remain their greatest tool
and our own greatest foil

Shut up
Think smart
Cops out
