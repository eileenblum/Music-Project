This isn't science fiction
This is judgment day
This is here
This is today

All-seeing eye
Angel of death
On silent wings
As unthinking as
A god's wrath
In human hands

New nightmares challenge sleep
Wake to a sick reality
Years of hell give way to a smile and an iron fist
Tightening its crushing grip
Hunter-killers in the skies
Beneath rain of fire
