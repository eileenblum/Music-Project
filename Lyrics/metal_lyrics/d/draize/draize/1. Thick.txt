Burned all the bridges around you
Still you're striking a match
Laying waste to all left in your wake
Busted glass and an eight stitch gash

Take a hard look at yourself
and tell me you don't understand

The writing is on the wall
In black and white
And it's begging to be read

You are thick as shit
