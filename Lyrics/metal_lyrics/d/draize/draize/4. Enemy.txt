Flying a banner
That should have remained buried
Tattered, trampled
Torn and left to rot
A darkness burned
Scorched into our collective past
You are turning the key
You are opening the door

Doomed to repeat
Condemned
Lines in the sand
Get blown away
And forgotten like dust

What was once inconceivable
Is now worn on your sleeve

You are resigned to death

If you stand under the sign of my enemy
You are my enemy
