A world exists beyond your eyes
And every heart can learn to feel this force
Within that maze it's hard to see
But we all can break through this darkness

So many souls drown in their simple lives
They cannot find their surface of the light
Because they choose to believe the lies
Around to reach foggy and wrong shores

Find the holy temple in yourself
The quest has just begun
A blue horizon shows the pathway
Over madness and sadness of this barren earth

You can be free
The wounds will heal
Forget and see
You can be free

You are like me
A discouraged believer by God's goodness
Inside an empty hourglass
We must break the silence now

We're all beings of frustration and aggression
But we can take a look behind the masquerade of our human perdition
If we increase our sight - If we stay
Open your heart and your mind
Around to touch the sweetness of the sun
