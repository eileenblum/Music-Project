Now the blood runs to a coffin bed so fresh
Each sorrow fades with the barren flesh
I desert my useless body and mourning place
Finally I've found the exit in life's maze

My resurrection! 

I am an old stowaway that can't stay
With growing wings I glide away
I drift deeper into the tunnel's white
And I touch my last remaining light

My resurrection!

Lost colours are recaptured in a funeral from my past
Everything breaks inside my blackened world of glass
Fallen is my soul's darkness with the last grain of sand
A blue horizon is reflected for that journey's end

Now the blood runs to a coffin bed so fresh
Each sorrow fades with the barren flesh
I desert my useless body and mourning place
Finally I've found the exit in life's maze
