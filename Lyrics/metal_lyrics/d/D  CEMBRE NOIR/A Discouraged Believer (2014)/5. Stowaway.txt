Gently I taste suicide air
Within the hourglass of despair
Angry grains push me down
In deep waves of sand I drown

I crawl upon a lonesome line
In a fragile world that never was mine
I am the worm and search for food in sorrow's moor
My heart is a cocoon around a depressive core

Filthy is the entrance of eternity
Salt drops run from my milky face freely
This life builds an ocean of thorns and dismay
With the ruthlessness of this gruesome day

I am embedded by the rain robe of an outstretched night
In void's mouth that shall swallow up my last pride
Underneath this pathetic sky that I despise
I know this hard mountain will come to a rise

Within a few seconds I breathe the earth's decay
Cold uncertainty surrounds that chosen pathway
I bury heart's fragments with a great desperation
Since I am the jaded icon of my self-domination

Slowly I observe the human feelings rot
Sometimes I sink in this ascending flood
When my spirit for eternal freedom cries
Then hope remains in these ancient eyes

I suffer with a silent cry - By the final day that I deny
And the small life shall drown torn asunder - I stand alone with the pain that is my hunter
I can't wait for death's embrace - I will stain me with disgrace

And I fall down to my knees and pray
To the sleepless Gods that turn away
Inside this realm I cannot be the king
Because I fill innocent hands with sin
I transform my blade's almighty force
To pure pandemonium and unbridled claws
The icy steel kisses the skin and veins of me
In vertigo's drunkenness I set all bother free

The strings tear apart - Stillness is the grand award
