Unhallowed soil among feet and body
Enslaved by the smoke of steel machines
Inside a poisoned garden from God's hand
My pathway of the nothingness
Bitterness licks my wounds and my lips
When I look through the ruins of my streets
And I pray for my dead brothers and sisters
Without peace inside my confused mind

Painted in grey is the barren fatherland
Fallen with the failed king upon life's chessboard
Like the proud warrior's hearts
I am the last - I am the blood - I am the doomed man

My longest journey has just begun
Inside a labyrinth of thorns and blood
So far away from the human nature
Deep within a tomb of atonement

With sorrow in sleepy eyes I crawl away
In the cold rain
But carried by hope and faith

I follow - red rivers - full of despair
To the gates of the hidden sun
For my tomorrow without pain...without pain

Unhallowed soil among feet and body
Enslaved by the smoke of steel machines
Inside a poisoned garden from God's hand
My pathway of the nothingness
Bitterness licks my wounds and my lips
When I look through the ruins of my streets
And I pray for my dead brothers and sisters
Without peace inside my confused mind

I am the last - The isolation - The blood - The mourning - I am the forsaken earth

Unhallowed soil among feet and body
Enslaved by the smoke of steel machines
Inside a poisoned garden from God's hand
My pathway of the nothingness
