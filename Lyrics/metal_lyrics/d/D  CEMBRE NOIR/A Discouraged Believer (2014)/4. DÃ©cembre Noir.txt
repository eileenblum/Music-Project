The world has changed its face
An eerie place - In December's mire
Lost behind the window
I know the snow burns like fire

Slowly comes the blankness
The time is right
November's dirge - The end
The enemy kills in white

Now I close the door
Tiny liberation
With a cure for the next days
For another salvation

Shadows of the past will rape my heart
The chamber corners let me shrink

The cross in my hands
And I pray to the sun
Thoughts whisper to God
Please use the gun
