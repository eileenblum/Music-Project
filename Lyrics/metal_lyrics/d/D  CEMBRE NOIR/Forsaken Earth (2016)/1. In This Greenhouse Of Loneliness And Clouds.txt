A black morning
Is somebody there?
Now I need a friend
In this greenhouse
Of loneliness and clouds
Where nothing exists
Except the time

Far away from the sun
Sleepless, day by day
Body and soul
United, grey in grey
Like a helpless lamb
In the arms of catatonia
With closed eyes
Against waves of insomnia

In this greenhouse of loneliness and clouds

Far away from the sun
Sleepless, day by day
Body and soul
United, grey in grey
Like a helpless lamb
In the arms of catatonia
With closed eyes
Against waves of insomnia

Distant and unreachable
My forsaken earth

Everything is gone
After the vast darkness
Therewith the remembrance
For every soul of the earth
So I carry the last wood
Through the nothingness
That's all what I have left
In this greenhouse
Of loneliness and clouds
Where nothing exists

In this greenhouse
Of loneliness and clouds
Where nothing exists
Except the time

In this greenhouse of loneliness and clouds
