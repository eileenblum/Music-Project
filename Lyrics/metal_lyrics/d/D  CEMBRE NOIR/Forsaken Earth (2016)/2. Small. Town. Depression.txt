All doors are closed to my regular world outside
There is no difference between day and night
So many things have lost their great meaning
Darkness is the murderer of every single feeling

But some tears are flowing behind a mask of stone
Nothing is what it seems within my broken home
Sometimes looking for a drug to kill the pain
In these bitter moments of endless shame

No one can hear my voice
I never had the choice
There is no helping hand
Yearning for an end

I don't know what I've become
Maybe an ugly remnant from a poor selection
I know there is no light for me
No God, no love and no word of affection
This gloomy house has stolen my smile
I raise the white flag for my own protection

All doors are closed to my regular world outside
There is no difference between day and night
So many things have lost their great meaning
Darkness is the murderer of every single feeling

Small town... small town depression!

Small town... small town depression!
