All my tears are gone
Only coldness remains
In the shade of my existence
Behind these lifeless walls

Dead flies in rusty corners
This house is lonely
Like my bleeding heart
Between silence and shards

A burnt out candle
The stench of farewell
In empty rooms
'Cause all hope has left the town

Now I will go away forever
To the end of the world
With broken wings
And with a million tears in my hands...

So I walk into the dark
With the city lights in my back
Surrounded by the night
The best time to clean my mind

Along the road to nowhere
With uncertainty in my eyes
Looking for the great answer
Who or what I have become

Along the road to nowhere
With uncertainty in my eyes
To find myself again

In this mental labyrinth of eternal detours
With smiling barred doors
Where fears and depressions lurk
Like hungry wolves for injured prey

'Cause all my tears I've cried
For so much sorrow and pain
Some ends are new beginnings
But the darkness will remain the same

Through the deepest forest of my soul
And the eerie swamp of the fallen ones
Across vast hills of skulls and bones
Death is everywhere
And with the face against the storm
So many miles away from home
Now everything seems so clear
At this point of no return

Upon the battlefield of my dread
Where all the shadows dwell
I'm hearing echoes of the dead
In this forsaken hell
Without tears in mournful eyes
Step by step with feet and hands
Through tragedies of life's demise
Death is the last grain of sand

So I walk into the dark
With the city lights in my back
Surrounded by the night
The best time to clean my mind
