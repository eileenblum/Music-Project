There's no way back home

Like a ghost, I'm sitting here in the dirt
At my lonesome beach of silent desperation
No words can describe this feeling of uselessness
I am breathing the eerie morning air
I'm waiting for salvation

A modern world has transformed my green paradise
Now it's an Eden of tears and dying leaves
Rapaciousness paints the world in blood and grey
A portrait of all living, in a fragile frame of the skeleton trees

I see the last bridges drown
There is no way back home
At the pale shore of my emptiness

And now I know, a vast darkness is coming for me as well
And now I know, a vast darkness is coming for me...

Where are ethic and its moral values hiding?
In these black hours of despair and the unforgiveness
Our daily reality is an unstoppable force of sadness
And we are just the ugly fragments of our own hypocrisy
The heaven is crying for our sins and ignorance
And I feel so ashamed for everything and everyone
Sometimes I dream of a better world
But these waves are getting higher and higher

And all what we've done is coming back to us
In the shape of rising winds, dust and death...

A formation of bleakness is filling the sky
Above my isle of mourning and doubts
I am trying to find a spark of daylight
In the gloomy wall of the hungry clouds
My hourglass is crying for more sand
