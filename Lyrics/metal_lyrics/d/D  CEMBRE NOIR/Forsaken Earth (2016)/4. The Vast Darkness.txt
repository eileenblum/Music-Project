Far away from society
The final path
In the secureness of nature
Driven by the human wrath
To the highest mountain
The only place that feels so real
I must reach the goal
Even if I can't see

Dead eyes stare into the void
I am a being without strength
Coldness licks the unkempt skin
The great moment of discontent

There is no perspective for my mournful mind
Eternal darkness runs through the veins of time
There is no cure to ignore the constant pain
Everything drowns in an ocean of rain

The blood runs fast from the cracks of my broken heart
Every moment of my past tears apart
And there is nothing more to share
Murderous silence speaks everywhere
I count the last seconds in this isolation
On the edge of my desperation
In all my years I've seen the nothingness
I'm the last element of the vast darkness

I do not care what will happen
Behind this labyrinth of my existence
Now I breathe liberty above the clouds
Nevertheless I am just an old blind man with outstretched hands

Today I pray for the last time
Maybe light comes behind the nowhere
At the abyss of all mortal depressions
Just one step further lies an answer

There is no perspective for my mournful mind
Eternal darkness runs through the veins of time
There is no cure to ignore the constant pain
Everything drowns in an ocean of rain

The blood runs fast from the cracks of my broken heart
Every moment of my past tears apart
And there is nothing more to share
Murderous silence speaks everywhere
I count the last seconds in this isolation
On the edge of my desperation
In all my years I've seen the nothingness
I'm the last element of the vast darkness
