There is no paradise upon the other side
By the cold embrace of the narrowness I can't unfurl my light
Like a glowworm in the depth's obscurity
But I am just an absurd teardrop within the face of eternity

I am one with the endless rain
Behind a glass wall of the loneliness
Unable to reach the shining sun
By this cursed place of hopelessness
Sometimes I sing with the clouds
About the monotony of the isolation
So discouraged and depressed
In the chains of damnation

Ghost dirge!
Ghost dirge!
Ghost dirge!

I am lost between space and time
Upon the quest for absolution
Oppressive silence is my only friend
In the core of seclusion

Ghost dirge
The whimper at the playground of eternity
Ghost dirge
So far away from the humanity
Ghost dirge
A serenade of the vast melancholy
Ghost dirge
The great desire to be free

There is no paradise upon the other side
By the cold embrace of the narrowness I can't unfurl my light
Like a glowworm in the depth's obscurity
But I am just an absurd teardrop within the face of eternity
