I learn something new everyday 
Hate myself in a brand new way 
I will escape the ways of a life burnt down and rebuilt
I'll finally escape this guilt

I foresee the way I want to be but my head is busted 
I wish it was easy
Slow release from my sanity
Choking on nothing
I should just breathe

Sickened by restlessness 
Fiending for acceptance 

But all I feel is pain surrounding me 
Binding me, crushing me, lying to me
Motherfuckers fronting
I need to live
I belong to me
