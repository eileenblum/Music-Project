Every story's the same
"My daddy never loved me"
Sick of all these games
Harlots just can't fucking be contained

Kill me

Faceless fiend
Ferocious being
Take none of the weak under your wing
Useless slave
Voracious for fame
How long will it take to forget your name?

Control, scratching the surface
Unreached itch, no end to this
Selfish bitch

Escaping the truth
Death, only release
The art of self defense
Defense only from yourself
Sucking at the teat of weakness
Pulling at the dick of the ones you can

Whoring for sport
Trophy after trophy
Do you have enough attention?
Look at me
