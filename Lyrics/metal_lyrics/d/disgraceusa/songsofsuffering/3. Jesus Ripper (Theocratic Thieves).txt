Burning alive in a cold sweat
How close are we all to death?
Frozen alive, no intelligence left
How much time do we have to repent?
When do we see the end?

No end in sight
Parchment filled with shit
The dark days have passed
Yet the children are fucking worthless
Theocratic thieves tearing away at me
Blinded by their own uncertainty 

Whore mother, womb of filth
End is nigh, stakes is high
Wretched stench, redemption
Failed attempt, life of sin

Father, please tell me why it has to be
Satisfied life-crooks, no respect earned
Piece of shit fuck
Weakling of the worst

Father, please tell me why it has to be
I don't know why I care
Conflict between books, pages torn and burned

On the day of judgement, reality's revealed 
None left to gloat, existence has been repealed
