A stick, a stone
The right size will break any bone
Far past the point of shame
No change to atone
Numb again, no pain
My bones are shown from the outside
A broken heart will break
It's seams and become malicious 

Who am I to ignore the request
Sent from my loins up to my head?
Yesterday is dead and gone
Tonight I will break the stride
For all who know the pain I've kept inside

Don't for a second think you ever knew my intention
To selfishly put your body to use
To see the tears stream from your eyes
It was the last thought on my mind

With that said, I have no regrets
The story's told, I'm unto new folds
I'm numb again, forever feel no pain
A lustful crusader for the best
Every wench, a new quest
