I, defense of the profane
10,000 years I shall reign

Now hear me
Let the dirt grace your knees
Let the taste of the asphalt feed all your desires
No need for gold, for I am humble
I just need your weak, fools and feeble

Hear me, fear me, know your place
Love me, need me, feel me deep

I am your King, fear me

Show me your faith
Prove your allegiance 
There's no other way,
No other time but now
I want to see you need me
I want to see you suffer
