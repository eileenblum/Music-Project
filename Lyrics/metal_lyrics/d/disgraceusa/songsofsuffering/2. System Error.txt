Broken books with tattered spines
Where's the place fools go to die?
A hell created for the empty-headed
Statements retracted and then regretted

I won't matter
Life of bullshit
Spreading cancer
Die of nothing
Live forever
System error

Empty-handed, but still a crook
Empty system, shotgun the fucks
A mind's riot in an open field
A SWAT team with no riot gear

Waste my breath, hold my time
Fill my pockets or stand in line

Forget everything I've ever said
We'll all be even further dead
Apathy will be your best friend
No worries until the end

A mind's riot in an open field
When the fuck will they learn to yield?

No time to rest, no time to progress
Just embrace fate and wait for death
