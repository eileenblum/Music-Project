[Music: Andersson/Goude, Lyrics: Goude/Lundberg]

So Here I am once more in my private hell again
Hunched foetal in darkness, trying to soothe the pain
Iâve killed myself a thousand times before
And if it would ease you pain
Iâll kill myself a thousand more

So Iâll die again

[Chorus:]
Take my hand
Take my soul
Take my wretched life and make me whole

Take my lies
Take my truth
Take them all away as I die before you

I scar you deep inside, I only leave you hurt
My black embrace only smoothers you with dirt
I hold the shining blade close to the vein
To cut me off from myself, to kill all the pain

[Chorus]
