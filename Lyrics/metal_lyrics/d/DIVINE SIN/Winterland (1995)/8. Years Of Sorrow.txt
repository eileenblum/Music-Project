[Music: Goude/Johansson, Lyrics: Lundberg]

The Angel of Mercy has broken his chain
Now heâs free, relieved from the pain
He was trapped in his hell, day by day
Damned inexorable to fade away

[Chorus:]
Why these years of sorrow
Why these years of fear
Searching for a reason
But the answer isnât there

Why these years of sorrow
Why these years of fear
Searching for a reason
But in emptiness I steer

[Solo: Halvar]

Why did the Tormentor proceed so brutally?
To slowly twist his neck in pure conspiracy
All of his life he had to try
But he couldnât help praying to die

[Solo: Micke]

[Chorus]
