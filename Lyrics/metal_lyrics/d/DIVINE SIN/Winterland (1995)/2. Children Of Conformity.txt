[Music: Goude/Halvarsson/Andersson, Lyrics: Goude/Lundberg]

We bring salvation for your soul and purity for your flesh
We shall rid your mind of thoughts, our name you shall bless
Weâll teach you our righteous ways and fill you with belief
Learn to live by our laws âcause apathy relieves

[Chorus:]
Sinner, confess, repent and be blessed
Sinner, repent for the life you led
Sinner, confess, repent and be blessed

Bring forth the lamb, bring it forth to the slaughter
We shall feast upon its blood
Rip and tear the flesh, sacrificial rites
In the name of the Living God

[Solo: Halvar, Micke]

Weâve conformed to obedient masses
Yu saved our souls from vice
But tell the truth âcause we seek the truth
Is there happiness in our eyes?

[Chorus]
