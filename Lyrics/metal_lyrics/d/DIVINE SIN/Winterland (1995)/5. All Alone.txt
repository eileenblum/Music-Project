[Music: Goude/Knutar/Johansson, Lyrics: Lundberg/Goude]

The sound of silence scares me
I close my eyes and hold my breath
As I hide in the gloom to escape the certain death
No one is left to shed a tear
All are gone except the one I fear

[Chorus:]
I fear my fate is sealed
It feeds upon the fear I feel

Its breath upon my neck
The time has come, screams wonât help me now
The safety of light yet so far away
Itâs dragging my life, my soul deeper
Dragging me down into eternity

[Chorus]

The Reaperâs dice has been thrown
Still Iâm afraid to face the unknown

Realityâs dim, dimensions twist
Time stands still, yet eons pass me by
Logic is no more, my sanity fades
Trapped in this nothingness, never to die

[Solo: Micke, Halvar]

All alone...
