[Music: Andersson/Lundberg/Halvarsson/Goude/Knutar, Lyrics: Lundberg]

When I passed the line the seventh time
It opened up the gate to the shadows in my dreams

[Chorus:]
Iâll take your soul for free my friend
So come to me

It opened up the gate to the shadows in my dreams
The light of darkness so tempting it seems

[Solo: Micke]

When I saw that sign the seventh time
I could feel His hand reaching out for me, He said

[Chorus]
