[Music: Goude/Halvarsson, Lyrics: Lundberg]

My time has gone
It wonât come again
It seems so distant
When...
It lay ahead of me
The path of lifeâs infinity
All those years of misery

[Chorus:]
I look to the stars and watch one fall
I close my eyes and pray theyâll call
Canât they see, my wish is deep
All these years longing for endless sleep

My time has gone
It wonât come again
The time of innocence
When...
It lay ahead of me
A life of opportunity
The time of ignorance
When I was free

[Chorus]

[Solo: Micke]

[Chorus]
