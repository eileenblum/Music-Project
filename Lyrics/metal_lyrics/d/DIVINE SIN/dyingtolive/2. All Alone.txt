The sound of silence scares me,
I close my eyes and hold my breath.
As I hide in the gloom to escape
The certain death, none is left to
Shed a tear, all are gone except the one I fear

I fear my fate is sealed
It feeds upon the fear I feel

It's breath upon my neck, time has come
Screams won't help me now.
The safety of light, so near yet so far.
It's dragging my life my soul deeper
Dragging me down into eternity

I fear...

The reapers dice has been thrown
Still I'm afraid to face the unknown

Realitys so dim, dimensions twist
Time stand still, yet eons pass me by.
Logic is no more, my sanity fades
Trapped in this nothingness, never to die.

All alone, all alone...
