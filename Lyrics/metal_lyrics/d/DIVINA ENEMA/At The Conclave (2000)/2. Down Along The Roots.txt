[Caacrinolaas:]
Expel the conscience of yours merely!
And incense will seem to be reaching the stars!
In stampede miserable deviltry is!

[Demons in chorus:]
Oh, they are!

[Peter:]
Suddenly a wind arose 
behind me pushing me ahead...
Something cold came running down my face 
Deep down I fell
Shadows cast by the stones 
cowered the ground
something dark lay in the grass
There's distant gnarly grove ahead
with tangled gloomy trunks and branches 
unlike they are and yet also much akin...

[Dome community:]
He indeed seems to be dead!
He seems to be dead!
He did recline his head so strange
'Twas very kind of him
if he would have passed away
somewhere else but here!
That maid in black has rather poor taste!
Oh yes! 
She does! 

[Oze:]
That was all meant for your good
you'll be alive
being buried root by root!
You don't believe the demons
so shall they accost to you?

[Caacrinolaas:]
Now listen to their wings' howl
crows sense a corpse from afar

[Dome community:]
He indeed seems to be dead!
Why won't you have a look at him?

[Oze:]
Let me cease all that stuff
I can race where no roads are!
I can abduct 
through deceit in sign I'll come
while wretched and grim grimaces
can hardly be seen through dust

Through the dust my flame will show its tongue
but there's no word to throw
through the mist you could have seen my eyes
don't you think they belong to foe?
They as thine belong to thee...
Oh thy broken entity
which thou shalt have to lose...

[Caacrinolaas:]
...riding it into mysterious loneliness
you have searched for!
Enter halls 
having passed by doors 
by the wooden mouth does beget nothing
but carrion!
There is but only venomous kiss
to drop down from these bitter lips!
There is but only wicked smile
to pass your torture by when you'll be die dying
wringing your hands in some kind of despair!
Let the spirit leave that jail 
the lair!

[Both in chorus:]
Leave your lair 
and rise your demons up into the air!
Leave your lair 
then let them bound deep into the ground!
Leave your lair 
let waving soil just now begin to boil!
Screaming
howling
looking for our future victim 
why wont you abet our swarm?

[Oze:]
I appear to serve you but ne'ertheless
I'll get what I am after!
I appear to kneel to you 
the devil knows what this is all about!

[Oze on the right:]
So to the devil with your soul!

[Caacrinolaas on the left:]
Something dark lay in the grass!

[Oze:]
Have you ne'er noticed
what an unpleasant sight is a person eating?
So you called the imp
while the expression of fiery eyes
showed a markedly increased voluptuousness

[Peter:]
Low dark clouds were slowly creeping on
to meet our cavalcade
leaden strips of rain came slanting down at us
The sky's array became filled with dark
a feeble streak of lightning flashed in distance
and no sooner did I see
sudden light torn night asunder
than an ocean of cold water fell hard
pouring down on me

And the night was as dark as soot
I couldn't see my fingers even

[Oze:]
I am to be your demon!
Now I show the path where immortality's to dwell!
I am to be your demon...
Now!

[Peter:]
Were I there I would not have been lost
in burning pits of hell

Caacrinolaas speaking in as cross a voice
as he could manage
Well, try to invent your own reality to dwell among...
You're slowly going down
not knowing what a deuce you forgot...
Nevertheless don't you admire the view?

[Oze:]
For no one did expect indeed
what a nice bird you turned out to be!
What then is there to regret...

[Caacrinolaas:]
...e'en though I am on the verge of tears

[Oze:]
So this way that'll never do
to be alive among such gloom!

[Caacrinolaas:]
So what then is left to regret about 
lay waste your fear!
You'd better leave all your graves to the dead 
let us fly and disappear among the chaos!
Among the chaos you ride the demons 
we shall ride the beast tonight
Satan
Satan he was named 
Satan was he named!
And who will be chained?
Answer now
as we'll beget
his proper place among the death
the mysterious loneliness among the...
DEAD!

[Peter:]
And that night was as dark as soot
I couldn't see my fingers even

[Oze:]
I am to be your demon
Now I show the path where dull reality's to dwell
I am to be your demon...

[Caacrinolaas:]
Now tell again about your feelings
as being penalised...

[Oze:]
So I wish you were not quite so deaf
I've had to ask you twice'

[Peter:]
It was not 'til one of them reminded the others
that they brought me the key
so they asked me not to be so blind
as wooden brotherhood

[Caacrinolaas:]
That will make your feathers fly 
don't take offence 
but IT came across your traces
A little do I wish!
You'll get much more than even devil has...
Lo! Something dark lies in the grass!

Do step down the flame!
Into the bog does burn and shine in darkness
blazing from inside so heavenly 
divinity it has...
or else 
something dark lies in the grass!
