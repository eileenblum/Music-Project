Preacher, preacher, preacher! Thereâs no use in trying to explain
You left me here alone, now whoâs to blame?
Iâm drowning, sinking deeper, feeding silence since Iâve reached this hell
For everything Iâve had in lifeâs wishing well
Cause when the darkness enters you, it clouds your mind
I donât know what is wrong, or what is right
The structure fails, the cracks are clearer, no light in sight

Can you take me with you?
Wherever the dark has gone, to somewhere that I belong?
Here in the river, Iâve spent so long finding requiem.

Broken, beaten Father, you have my ears, so shall we start?
Are you the reason why it all fell apart? Oh Yeah
Staring mirror mirror, what is it that you think you see?
Whatever left is just a shadow of me
But when the light removes you and all you are is a silhouette dancing
Alone with the reaper, any last regrets?
The structures fail, the shackles are breaking, release from fate

Can you take me with you ?
Wherever the dark has gone, to somewhere that I belong?
Here in the river, Iâve stayed so long finding requiem

Can you take me with you?
To the other side, beyond where the dark has gone?
Can you take me with you ?
Wherever the dark has gone, to somewhere that I belong?
Here in the river, Iâve spent so long trying to find my requiem
Can you take me with you ?
Wherever the dark has gone, to somewhere that I belong?
Here in the riverâ¦finding requiem
