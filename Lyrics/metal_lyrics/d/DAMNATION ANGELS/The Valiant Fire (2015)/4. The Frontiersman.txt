I dream of a new life
An oath that's to repay
A light for tomorrow
Hope for a better day
I set sail to a new land
A foolish man, they say
As I make my final journey to the frontier far away

The dawn of a new world
Singing ahaha
And my home is here

I walk to my new life in that frontier far away
This place had no memory but cuts of my pain
And one day I wander and saw her by the lake
A thing of beauty looked at me and took my heart away
She walked me to a place beyond the hills
To people there with open arms
The took me in and treated me like their own
Gave me love that I had never known

We sing ahaha
Our times grow in here
Ahaha
And my home is here
We sing ahaha
And don't ever leave her
Ahaha
But they're coming, I fear

We gaze at the moonlight
And tell us around the fire
Drink to the memories that feel so at home
But tomorrow they come to take it all away
I'd be damned if I don't stand in their way

But tomorrow they come to take it all away
I'd be damned if I don't stand in their way
I'd be damned if I don't stand in their way

So we fought to our last breath
As we fell to the ground
Memories flashed before us
Our hearts made the sound
We were always outnumbered
And doomed from the start
It'd be damned if we didn't do as we were posed
Damned if we didn't do white father's pose
Damned if we didn't stand our own ground

I went to the frontier it seemed so long ago
I dreamed of a new life but found my new home
And as we lay here our spirit appears
Destiny carries us away with the leaves

We sing ahaha
The fire's strong in here
Ahaha
But my home is here
And sing ahaha
And I'll never leave her
Ahaha
And now we stand together
Now we stand
