I welcome you to your new life
Leave everything you know behind
Your mind broken has just been realigned inside
(Now tell me)
Tell me are you empty like me
Surely you'll end up breathing the air I breathe
The only drug you need

(The very last drug you'll ever need)

You took the time to piece me back together
But can you rebuild my life?
Or am I stuck with this forever?
You crossed the line tryin' to redefine human nature
Tried to build it from the inside out
But you go one step to far
And Icarus is slicing down

Is our time out?

Our world is gone in an instance
The consequences of your lies
Plotting your mind so the future's set, the cause of our demise
(So tell me)
So tell me what you do in our defence
Walking hand in hand to the bitter end
Heading straight towards the edge

So walk with me straight towards the end

You took the time to piece me back together
But can you rebuild my life?
Or am I stuck with this forever?
You crossed the line tryin' to redefine human nature
Tried to build it from the inside out
But you go one step to far
And Icarus is slicing down

I close my eyes and hope that things won't change that
the world as we know it will remain the same but
still try to push forward
The technologic advances and innovation
Leading to the end of liberation

You took the time to piece me back together
But can you rebuild my life?
Or am I stuck with this forever?
You crossed the line tryin' to redefine human nature
Tried to build it from the inside out
But you go one step to far
And Icarus his time is out

Our time is out
Our time is out
Our time is out
Our time is out
