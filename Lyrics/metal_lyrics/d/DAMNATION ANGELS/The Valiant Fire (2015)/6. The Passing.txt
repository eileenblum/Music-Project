So here I am, at the end of my life
I want to look back and recall all those great memories of mine
So take my hand and try not to cry
I want to teach you a lesson I learned from a far gone time
So follow me into my story, walk with me, Iâll take you far
Glory be, the spirit sis stronger than you could ever believe

So there we were right on the front line
I cannot deny we had fear in our eyes, but we felt so alive
And the job fell to us, to make the charge
But if thereâs a God, He was watching over us as He made them march
They followed me into the glory, stood by me, my brothers in arms
Tenacity, our spirit was stronger than you could ever believe
And finally, everything became so clear to me, I now understood
All you need to set you free from all that in life is believe

I donât have much time
So remember my words, and remember my love
Remember to keep that spirit and fire alive inside
Remember my words, remember my life
They followed me into the glory, stood by me, my brothers in arms
Tenacity, our spirit was stronger than you could ever believe
And finally, everything became so clear to me, I now understood
All you need to set you free from all that in life is believe
Donât follow me (follow me)
Donât follow me (follow me), yeah-haa-haa
Donât follow me (follow me)
Donât follow me
