Here we are
At the crossroads of our world
Another fallen but not a faltered spirit

[Success in not final, failure in not final.
It is the courage to continue that counts.
âWinston Churchill]

Here we are
At the crossroads of our world
Another fallen but not a faltered spirit

And our eyes
They tell different stories
But the pain inside
It's all the same

Here we are
Is this what's left of us?
Here we stand broken but still alive
What about the fire?
The fire still burns inside
But what about the future?

From ground zero we'll rebuild
From the ashes we will rise
Piece it all back from inside

For the life that we leave behind
And the world that we built from ground zero
Not for the pain but for the healing sun
For the will that is ours
Remains strong

This is who we are

Still here we are
Standing right in front of you
Holding hands we re-ignite
So what are you to do

Yet still you're trying and break us
But you cannot take what's inside
Spirit that makes us
It makes us who we are
Makes us who we are
This is who we are

For the life that we leave behind
And the world that we built from ground zero
Not for the pain but for the healing sun
For the will that is ours
Remains strong

[Solo]

For years they try to break us
But they cannot take what's inside
'Cause the spirit's the thing that makes us, that makes us fly

[Solo]

For the life that we leave behind
And the world that was built by our heroes (this is who we are)
Not for the pain but for the healing sun (this is who we are)
For the will that is ours
Remains strong
