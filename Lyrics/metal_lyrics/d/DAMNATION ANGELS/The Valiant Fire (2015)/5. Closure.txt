Father I have sinned, I have lived a life of wrong
Please tell me where do I begin to state
My heartbeats fading out, itâs lifeless just like me
And time is running out, so let me tell you my story
I stood by historyâs leaders, and I planted demon seeders
But I regret the time that I have lost, I must stand ready to pay the cost
Haunted by my choices made, I sent people to their grave
Hollow man I have became, a hollow man I may decay
Is it too late to take it back? Is it too late to repent?
Is whatâs done is done at once? Mass despair!
For the first time, I bestow life, so that I may heal just a little bit
For the last time I ask for your forgiveness. so that I can find some peace in my mind

â63 I was Kennedyâs arrow, 911 I was watching in the shadows
â44 I was storming the beaches, infecting heroes with demon leaches
Haunted by the things Iâve done, knowing the battles have been won
Living a life with sorrow, condemned this shallow me to die
Am I too far gone? Is it too late? Is whats done lost on regret?
For the first time, I bestow life, so that I may heal just a little bit
For the last time I ask for your forgiveness. so that I can find some peace in my mind

All the things that I have done, I need closure in this life
All the people I have harmed, I need closure in my life
I canât live with this, I canât live with this
I canât live with this, I canât live with this
I canât live with this, I canât live with this

For the first time, I bestow life, so that I may heal just a little bit
For the first time, I bestow life, so that I may heal just a little bit
For the last time I ask for your forgiveness. so that I can find some peace in my mind

All the things that I have done, some closure in my life
All the people I have harmed, I need closure in this life
I canât live with this, I canât live with this
I canât live with this, I canât live with this
I canât live with this, I canât live with this
I wonât die with this
