I wanted to tell this story long ago, searching on the path I roam,
for answers I may never know
And now it seems like so long ago, they took your heart away from mine
And your memoryâs with me all the time
And I walk alone, through the sun, wind, rain, and snow
But I know your spirit stands beside me, like the heart donât leave you free

Far beyond this world (and I walk alone) I am with you (every distant tear)
But Iâve seen your face ( miles turn into time)

Pain talks to what I left behind, I watched her die before my eyes
Scared, helpless and paralyzed, so I commit to my final journey
Tensions bursting within me, faster than this world I leave
And I walk alone, through the sun, wind, rain, and snow
You love is living through every footstep of my life, and itâs my only guiding light

Far beyond this world (and I walk alone), I am with you (every distant tear)
But Iâve seen your face ( miles turn into time)
Far beyond this world (and I walk alone), I hear you (every distant tear)
Youâre calling me (Now Iâve got you, Everlasting)

Roaming, roaming on (I have searched for you),
Roaming, roaming on (for a trace of you)
For my search goes on and on and on

Your path of dust is hell aven, my winding road, where will it end
If I saved your soul and I made things right, would I be with you if I took my life?
And into your soul or somewhere beyond, all I know is thatâs where I belong

Far beyond this world (and I walk alone), I am with you (every distant tear)
But Iâve seen your face ( miles turn into time)
Far beyond this world (and I walk alone), I hear you (every distant tear)
Youâre calling me (Now Iâve got you, Everlasting)

Roaming, roaming on, roaming, roaming on
Roaming, roaming on, roaming, roaming on
On and on and on
Roaming, roaming on, roaming, roaming on
Roaming, roaming on, roaming, roaming on
Roaming, roaming on
