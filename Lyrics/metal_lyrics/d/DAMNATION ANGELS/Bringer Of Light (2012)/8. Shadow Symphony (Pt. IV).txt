Look at me, my eyes are open wide
But in the light, I am blind
What do they expect of me?
I gave it all for one last time
The people need a hero not like me
I can't condone, I can't forget
My eyes are open as I turn my head away
I am gone but my shadow remains

Shadow symphony

This pain has gone on for too long

Can't you see, my pain is inside out
What am I to do
I can clearly see the end
If I don't walk away from you
For you I leave my legacy behind
And with it I leave my pain
I can only be what I can be
So I leave my shadow symphony

A sign of my pride
It's the sound of my demise
Because the balance of the world
Is the weight upon my shoulders

My love, my love, take me away,
my love from here, my love take me away
My love, my love, take me away,
my love from here, my love take me away

In the shadows scorn and the fire's symphony

This pain has gone on for too long
The past always clouds my mind
Will you do this last thing for me
Take my place in this world

This pain has gone on for too long
The past always clouds my mind

Will you do this last thing for me
Take my place in this world

Why do the shadows fade away and turn to gray?
Pale is all that's left of me
Take my place
I, I'm left to turn away
I have no choice
It's been taken away from me
My life for yours

My shadow symphony

A sign of my pride
It's the sound of my demise
Because the balance of the world
Is the weight upon my shoulders
A sign of my pride
It's the sound of my demise
An end to my pain
In the shadows scorn and the fire's symphony

My love, my love, take me away,
my love from here, my love take me away
My love, my love, take me away,
my love from here, my love take me away

A shadow, my shadow symphony

My love, my love, take me away,
my love from here, my love take me away
My love, my love, take me away,
my love from here, my love take me away

My Shadow symphony
