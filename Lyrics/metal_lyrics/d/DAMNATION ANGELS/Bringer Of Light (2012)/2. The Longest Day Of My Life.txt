Â 
In my life I made a choice
To be what I have to be
But when I am to see myself in the mirror
I can't contain my pain
It looks me right in the eye

The secrets that I hide
Mean that in no one I can confide
I chose this life and fall to secrecy
But in the end it turns on me
The longest day of my life

This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever

In my life I broke a promise
I said I will always be there
I'm coming to find you to bring you back
This pain that I try to hide
Because I play your whole lie cannot defy

This time I'll change
I'll do things differently
I'll never let you go
Protect you with my life

This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever

Countless times they say I crossed the line
But ask me how many lives I saved in time
Innocents don't have to die
Not in my war
Not on my time
I'll do what I have to do until I die
This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again

So you question my decisions now
Let me ask you how you'll feel
If all that mattered to you was so suddenly ripped away
Would you fight for it
Would you cross the line
Or would you let them slip away
I did my life

This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again

And a day will come
When the warriors standing
Will be you and me
And that day has come
I'ts all they sing of
The final day for me is here

The final day is here

This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever

This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together

Picking up the pieces
