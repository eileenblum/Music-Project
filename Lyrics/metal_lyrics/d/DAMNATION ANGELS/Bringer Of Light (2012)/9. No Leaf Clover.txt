[originally by Metallica]And it feels right this time 
On his crash course with the big time 
Paid no mind to the distant thunder 
Today filled his head with wonder... boy 

Says it feels right this time 
Turn around and found the light lime 
Good day to be alive... sir 
Good day to be alive he said 

Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
At the end of your tunnel 
It's just a freight train comin your way 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
At the end of your tunnel 
It's just a freight train comin your way 

Don't it feel right like this 
All the pieces fall to his wish 
Sucker for that quick reward... boy 
Sucker for that quick reward they said 

Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
At the end of your tunnel 
It's just a freight train comin your way 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
At the end of your tunnel 
It's just a freight train comin your way 
It's comin' your way 
It's comin your way 
It comes! 

Then it comes to be that the soothing light 
At the end of your tunnel 
Was just a freight train comin your way 

Then it comes to be... yeah
