Â 
The world is slowly caving in
as my darkness grows within
These walls are sanctuary for me
I know that others would rather die

They will not let me be alone
and for them I gave my soul
And somehow I feel I am reborn
I've been reborn

I've paid the price for my own mistakes
But am I born into a fate I can't change
This pain of life that never seems to end
And I wonder why

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before

You ask me why I have faith in God
And became my own worst fear
You live in a world where no one seems to care
Let me take you there

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before
Am I living this life once more
This pain of life that never seems to end

I can't change what's become of me
I can only wish for what might have been
I pray for the day I finally die
Until then I will wonder why

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been reborn

I have been reborn
