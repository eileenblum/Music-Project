Far away in a distant land
Ten men, weapons close at hand
These men are at war for peace
Outnumbered they are up against all odds
But their spirit is undetered
On the distant cries in the wind
We hear our friends die in agony
We have learnt that we always must stay strong
Relying on each other till the day we die
Are we the only ones left?

So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
Find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
For pride we fight
For pride we die

We've been here for far too long
we haven't eaten in weeks
It's hard to go on
But with each day that slowly passes by
I don't feel like giving in
I'd rather die
Cos this is the way we are born to be

So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
Find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
A Warrior's heart, never dies
Never dies

We gather here, beneath the sky
The days go by and we lose track of time
Watching the seasons pass us by
Sun, wind, snow we've seen it all
But this is how we're born to be
To serve the king is our sworn duty
We fight these wars but why we do not know
A spirit of pride is all we own

So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
find another way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
A Warrior's heart, never dies

So this is how the story goes
We live to fight another day
and we will stay together as one
find another way, this is the warrior's way
We either win or we will die by
Each others sides
We fight for pride
We fight for pride
For pride we fight
For pride we die

A thousand years could pass us by
but it'll never change our warrior's pride
Our souls live on in another life
We'll stand together at each others sides
We will fight together and together we die
Cos this is our way
This is who we are
The Warrior's way will live on forever
in the hearts and souls of all who stand together
The spirit lives on, in our song
To the end
