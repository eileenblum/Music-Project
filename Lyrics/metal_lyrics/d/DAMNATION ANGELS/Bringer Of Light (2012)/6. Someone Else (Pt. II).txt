Hope, hope can sometimes change your life
Hope can set you free
Hope can be a light in the dark
Dreams, dreams may sometimes be shattered
Dreams might even fade away
But dreams can give you hope
Inside yourself

Me, I gave up long ago
I lost my hope, I lost my dreams
I became someone else
You, you still remember me
But do you know and do you see
What I really am?

I'll stay right here
Even though I've lost my life
To be a hero in your eyes
But will a hero live today
and will he fly away
or will he fade to black?

This is how the story goes
Yet how it ends, no one knows
I've become this to take revenge
To justify my actions
If our paths should cross again
In your mind I'm still the same
If you see a sign in the dark night
Would you think of me?

I'll stay right here
Even though I've lost my life
To be a hero in your eyes
But will a hero live today
and will he hide his pain
Or will he fade
Or will he fade away?

I'll stay right here
Even though, I know
I know my life's a lie
And I long to save you
Then I'll be a hero
I'll be a hero
I'll be a hero
In your eyes

I'll stay right here
Even though I've lost my life
To be a hero in your eyes
But will a hero live today
and will he fly away
or will he fade to black?

I'll stay right here
I've become someone else
Even though I've lost my life
I've become someone else
To be a hero in your eyes
Can't you see me?
But will a hero live today
I've become someone else
and will he hide his pain
I've become someone else
Or will he fade to black?
