A cold place fading into darkness
Descending into madness
What will be left when I am gone
A time when hope once there
Has gone, never to return
People cry out for a saviour
They are still to learn

That when the world descends into darkness
I'll bring the light

This path is one I must walk alone
I have promised myself I'd break free of your hold
And of the chains that keep me here
I'm not a prisoner of this world
I've become what I have to be
The dark is bringing back the light in me
Bringer of light

I stand here reflecting on my past
High above the ground
And in my thoughts I know
My destiny is this
Tell me what do you believe in?
A saviour, Another hero
That's not what I am
I'm just a man

But when the world descends into darkness
I'll bring the light

This path is one I must walk alone
I have promised myself I'd break free of your hold
And of the chains that keep me here
I'm not a prisoner of this world
I've become what I have to be
The dark is bringing back the light i me
Bringer of light

Tell me, is this what I have to be
Is this my destiny
Am I condemned to the night
To be a bringer of light
Oh how I wish to move on
But my love for you keeps me here
But it's not meant to be
While the bringer of light's in me

The bringer of light's in me

This path is one I must walk alone
I have promised myself I'd break free of your hold
And of the chains that keep me here
I'm not a prisoner of this world
I've become what I have to be
The dark is bringing back the light in me
Bringer of light
This path is one I must walk alone
I have promised myself I'd break free of your hold
And of the chains that keep me here
I'm not a prisoner of this world
I've become what I have to be
The dark is bringing back the light in me
Bringer of light

Bringer of light
