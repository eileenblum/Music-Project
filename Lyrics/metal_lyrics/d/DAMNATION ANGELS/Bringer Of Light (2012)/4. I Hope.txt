Fear can hold you prisoner
Hope can set you free

This is my last request
Will you forgive me for what I have done?
I've come to realise as the years passed me by
I made a mistake
I was living a lie

I hope that the ocean will be as blue as in my dreams
I hope that one day I will see my friend again
I know I'm soon to see and find
That I'm nothing on the outside
I hope
I hope

Just me all alone in my empty cell
My thoughts echo throughout this old and lonely shell
And it was in the cold of night
I dreamt of a day
I'd be released from this hell
Forgiven...

I hope that the ocean's under the bluest sky and I recall
I think that I've been there in my dreams before
I know that in life it set me free

And I'll keep holding on
I hope

Get me out of this hell
I spent too long dying in this prison cell
Will you set me free?
Release the pain of life from me

Tell me what u see
This old tired man is what's left of me
Would you set it free?
The only thing left, the hope in me

Hope never dies

Can I be condemned for life
For my mistakes?
You know I regret what I have done
Can I seek forgiveness in my sour?
To set me free
Set me free

I hope that the ocean's under the bluest sky and I recall
I think that I've been there in my dreams before
I know that one day we'll meet again
And I'll keep holding on
I hope
