Until the night where everything changed
I was a young boy with dreams and aspirations
But after that night things would never be the same
A shadow hung over me and it would do until the day I died

I learnt in the light of a new day
That things could never be the same between us
But my love for you remained
All those years I was gone
I was holding on

I left my life for a new beginning
And became what I knew I had to be
To bring justice upon a corrupt world
To bring back the light in me

And strike fear into the hearts of all once feared
For vengeance
For Justice
For love?

Maybe one day you'll see me, think of we
