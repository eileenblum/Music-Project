NO PLACE ON THIS EARTH TO FIND ETERNAL PEACE
BUT IN THE EARTH ITSELF

ON MY QUEST, CONFLICTS WITH OTHERS ON BELIEFS
OF HOW DEATH IS TO BE

TO CALM THE MIND... AT THE TIME OF DEATH,
A BETTER PLACE WE'LL GO

ONCE A PART OF THE EARTH. SOON TO BE ANOTHER
SCRUTINY

LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER, LOOKING FOR A REASON
WHY MUST WE CONFLICT UNTIL ALL IS DESTROYED
IS IT MEANT TO BE OR EXTERMINATE THE LEGION?
I WISH WE'D WORK IT OUT, IT'S GETTING ME ANNOYED

HOW MUCH LONGER CAN WE SURVIVE AS MAN THRIVES OFF
POWER AND SUPREMACY

LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER, LOOKING FOR A REASON
WHY MUST WE CONFLICT UNTIL ALL IS DESTROYED
IS IT MEANT TO BE OR EXTERMINATE THE LEGION?
I WISH WE'D WORK IT OUT, IT'S GETTING ME ANNOYED

CREATED BY THE EARTH NOW TRYING TO OVERCOME

MAN UNRELENTING TO YIELD AS WE VEER TOWARD
OUR OWN DESTRUCTION

AS WE DIE - AGAIN WE BECOME THE EARTH, WHERE WILL
WE GO WHEN IT'S DESTROYED ???

SCRUTINY ...
