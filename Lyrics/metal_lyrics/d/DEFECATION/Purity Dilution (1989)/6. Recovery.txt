PLANET MAIMED
DAMAGE DOME
NOTHING GAINED
NOTHING WON

EXTERNALLY
EARTH IS IMPAIRED
LOOKS AS IF
NOBODY CARED

I FIND IIN MY DISCOVERY
THE EARTH IS IN A STATE OF RECOVERY

AS WE LIVE ON WE MAKE IT WORSE
THE WOUNDS WE CAUSE MAY NOT DISPERSE

CAN EARTH EVER BE REPAIRED
OR ARE WE LEFT WITHOUT A PRAYER
WHAT WE'VE DONE WE CAN'T ERASE
NOW OUR WORLD IS LEFT DEFACED
