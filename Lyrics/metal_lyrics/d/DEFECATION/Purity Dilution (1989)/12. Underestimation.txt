THE DANGERS WE'RE EXPOSED TO DAILY
NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME
WE TEND TO UNDERESTIMATE SHIT
THAT COULD REALLY FUCK US UP

WE MAY NOT KNOW IF SOMETHINGS TESTED
WE MAY FIND OUT THAT WE'RE THE TEST

THEY TELL US WHAT THEY WANT TO TELL US
THEY DON'T WANT A NATIONAL PANIC

WHAT IF WE WERE AN EXPERIMENT
A MEASLY 100 LIVES TO SAVE A MILLION

UNDERESTIMATION IS THE KEY WORD
OF THE STUPID MOTHERFUCKERS WHO THINK
THEY RULE OUR WORLD

OFFICIALS COULD WORK AGAINST US
AND COVER SHIT UP

AT TIMES WE THINK THEY'RE WORKING FOR US
BUT THE REALITY DEVELOPS
