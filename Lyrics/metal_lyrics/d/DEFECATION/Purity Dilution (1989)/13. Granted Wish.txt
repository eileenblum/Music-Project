[BONUS TRACK]

FOR PEOPLE'S INTEREST IN DEFECATION, HERE ARE A FEW NOTES EXPLAINING THE
PROJECT.

THE IDEA FOR THE PROJECT STARTED BACK IN `87 WHEN ME AND MITCH STARTED WRITING
TO EACH OTHER AND TRADING TAPES WITH EACH OTHER. I TOLD MITCH THAT IN THE
SUMMER OF `88 I WAS GOING TO TAKE A VACATION TO THE USA AND VISIT NEW YORK AND
LAS VEGAS, HE WROTE ONCE AGAIN, THIS TIME SAYING WE SHOULD FORM A PROJECT BAND
TOGETHER WHEN I COME TO VEGAS. SO I SAID IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA AND WHY NOT.
I ARRIVED IN VEGAS IN SEPTEMBER `88 AND THE TWO OF US WENT INTO A GARAGE THAT
A FEW LOCAL VEGAS HARRDCORE BANDS USED TO JAM OUT IN (FUCK IT WAS A HOT PLACE)
AND THE TWO OF US PASSED ON IDEAS TO EACH OTHER FOR RIFFS AND DRUM BEATS. BY
THE THIRD PRACTICE WE HAD, THINGS WERE SOUNDING COOL,, WE HAD BOTH THOUGHT IT
 AND A FEW MORE SONGS AND ASK NUCLEAR
BLAST RECORDS (WHO HAVE DONE THE RIGHTEOUS PIGS LP "LIVE AND LEARN" RECENTLY)
IF HE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN RELEASING A MINI LP OR 12 INCH AND HE SAID
STRAIGHT AWAY "NO PROBLEM". SO THE TWO OF US BEGAN WRITING MORE TUNES AND
 FOR THE SONGS ETC. WE PRACTICED ALTOGETHER 8
TIMES FROM THE START TO FINISH IN GARAGES AND HOUSES FRIENDS MITCH KNEW WITH
LOTS OF HELP OFF FRIENDS TO HELP OUT WITH BORROWING EQUIPMENT ETC. (THANX) AND
 AND PHONED UP
A FEW STUDIOS THAT COULD HELP US OUT FOR THE RECORDING OF THE 12 INCH AS THE
IDEA IN THE START WAS TO RECORD ALL THE DRUMS/BASS/GUITARS/VOCALS IN VEGAS AND
I WOULD MIX IT IN ENGLAND. WELL WE FOUND A STUDIO AND BOOKED OURSELVES IN FOR
12 HOURS TO RECORD EVERYTHING AS WE WERE PUSHED FOR MONEY. WELL, ALL WENT
WELL, WE RECORDED AND PUT DOWN VOCALS TO 4 SONGS AS MITCH HAD ONLY AT THIS
 TO 4 AND I HAVE TO LEAVE THE DAY WE HAD FINISHED LAYING DOWN
THE 1ST 4 SONGS OF VOCALS AND MITCH WOULD GO BACK INTO THE STUDIO TO DO THE
, ONE
WEEK LATER, THEN SEND ME THE ONE INCH TAPE. WELL MITCH PHONED ME UP 2 WEEKS
LATER, WHICH WAS NOW OCTOBER, AND SAID HE HAD JUST FINISHED LAYING DOWN THE
VOCALS TO THE LAST 3 SONGS AND POSTED THE 1 INCH TAPE TO ME. WELL I WAITED AND
WAITED TILL THE END OF OCTOBER FOR THE TAPE AND IT FINALLY ARRIVED AT MY
TOWN'S POST OFFICE, BUT I WASN'T AROUOND AT THE TIME TO COLLECT IT SO IT WAS
SENT BACK TO SENDER - BEING MITCH. WELL THE POST OFFICE, BEING BULLSHIT FUCKED
UP AS USUAL AND LOST THE TAPE. WELL MITCH WAITED AND WAITED TILL IT WAS TIME
TO EXPLAIN TO MARKUS (NUCLEAR BLAST) WHAT HAD HAPPENED, WELL BY NOW WE WERE
ALL PISSED OFF AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. WEEKS AND WEEKS WENT BU
TILL JANUARY `89 MITCH PUT IN FOR HIS CLAIM 700 DOLLARS INSURANCE WHICH HE HAD
INSURED THE TAPE FOR AND THE POST OFFICE SENT A TRACER OUT TO TRY AND TRACK IT
DOWN. WLL BY THIS TIME IT WAS DECIDED BY THE TWO OF US AND MARKUS, THAT MITCH
SHOULD FLY TO ENGLAND TO RECORD IT ALL OVER AGAIN. SO HE BOOKED UP A FLIGHT
FOR FEBRUARY AND ONE DAY BEFORE HE WAS TO FLY, THE TAPE SHOWED UP. MITCH
PHONED UP AND TOLD ME THE NEWS THEN PHONED MARKUS US AND MARKUS SAID GO AHEAD,
GO TO ENGLAND AND MIX IT ETC. SO MITCH FLEW OVER AND WHEN HE ARRIVED HE TOLD
ME HE WANTED TO RE-RECORD THE BASS &amp; GUITARS AGAIN FOR A BETTER SOUND ETC.
MARKUS SAID "NO PROBLEM" BUT AS IT HAD NOW COST US A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN IT
SHOULD HAVE, MARKUS ASKED US TO RECORD A FEW MORE SONGS TO MAKE IT INTO A MINI

AGAIN AND WE JAMMED OUT IN MY BEDROOM FOR 4 MORE PRACTICES AND CAME UP WITH 4
MORE SONGS AND AN INTRO. THEN BOOKED OURSELVES IN BIRDSONG STUDIOS FOR 29
HOURS AT 325 POUNDS AS WE WERE TOTALLY PUSHED FOR MONEY. WELL WHEN WE ARRIVED
AT THE STUDIO THE TAPE WE HAD USED TO RECORD ON IN VEGAS WAS 1 INCH AND THE
SYSTEM AT BIRDSONG WAS HALP-INCH, SO WITH ONLY 29 HOURS AND 325 POUNDS, WE HAD
TO RECORD THE WHOLE LOT ALL OVER AGAIN PLUS THE NEW SONGS. WE KNEW IT WOULD BE
A RUSH ETC. (WHICH DIDN'T HELP MISTAKES) BUT THIS IS HOW IT ALL WENT. THANX TO
GREAT STEVE BIRD AND HIS TIME, PATIENCE AND FUCKEN HARD WORK IN SUCH SHORT
TIME TO DO AN LP (THANX PAL, YOU DID WONDERS FOR US) SO THANX TO ALL THE
PEOPLE WHO HELPED US OUT IN VEGAS (IT WASN'T A WASTE OF TIME) AND IN ENGLAND,
IT'S BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND TOTAL BLOODY AUTOPSY DOSS.
THANX MICK
