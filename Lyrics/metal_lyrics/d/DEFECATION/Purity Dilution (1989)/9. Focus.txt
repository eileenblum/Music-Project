TAKE A LOOK AROUND AND WHAT DO I SEE
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE BEST OF ME
OUT TO WORK TO PAY MY BILLS
SOONER OR LATER I'M OVER THE HILL
BUSTING MY ASS NOW I'M THE FOOL
BECAUSE I'M PLAYING BY THE RULES
EXAMINING LIFE DAY BY DAY
WASTING AWAY IS THE PRICE I PAY

I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE AND TAKE THIS SHIT
BECAUSE I'M FUCKEN TIRED OF IT
NOW TELL ME COLLEGE IS THE KEY
YOU CAN FOOL THEM BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL ME
OR WORK UNTIL YOU'RE 65
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL YOU SURVIVE
PROMISE ME A FUCKEN PENSION
YOU FUCK OFF THAT'S MY DISSENSION

NOW I FOCUS, THINGS ARE CLEAR
NOT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING HERE
I LOOK AT MYSELF AND SEE MY REFLECTION
I'M HEADED IN A NEW DIRECTION

GO TO COLLEGE FOR 6 YEARS
THEN YOU GRADUATE
BE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
BET YOU THINK ITS GREAT
CUT YOUR HAIR AND GET A JOB
SO YOU CAN RELATE
REALIZE YOUR YOUTH IS GONE
TO TURN BACK IS TOO LATE

TAKE A LOOK AROUND AND WHAT DO I SEE
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE BEST OF ME
OUT TO WORK TO PAY MY BILLS
SOONER OR LATER I'M OVER THE HILL
BUSTING MY ASS NOW I'M THE FOOL
BECAUSE I'M PLAYING BY THE RULES
EXAMINING LIFE DAY BY DAY
WASTING AWAY IS THE PRICE I PAY

I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE AND TAKE THIS SHIT
BECAUSE I'M FUCKEN TIRED OF IT
NOW TELL ME COLLEGE IS THE KEY
YOU CAN FOOL THEM BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL ME
OR WORK UNTIL YOU'RE 65
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL YOU SURVIVE
PROMISE ME A FUCKEN PENSION
YOU CAN FUCK OFF THAT'S MY DISSENSION
