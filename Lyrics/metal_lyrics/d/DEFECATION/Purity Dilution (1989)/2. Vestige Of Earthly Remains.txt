DECLINE OF THE HUMAN EMPIRE
MANS EXISTENCE HAS EXPIRED
DISINTEGRATION IN A FLASH OF LIGHT
WRECKAGE IS WAHT IS LEFT IN SIGHT

THE SCARS OF LIFE ARE LEFT BEHIND
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MANKIND?
NOW OUR WORLD IS LEFT IN RUBBLE
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WE WERE IN TROUBLE

VESTIGES AND DECAY
THE EARTH IS LEFT THIS WAY
ASHES THE ONLY TRACE
NOW A LONELY PLACE

SHIFTING THROUGH REMAINS
NOTHING HERE TO GAIN
LIFELESS BARREN ZONE
AND I'M LEFT HERE ALONE

HUMAN LIFE IS OVERTHROWN
LOOK AT WHAT I ONCE CALLED HOME
THIS PLANET SEEN IS LEFT DEMOLISHED
ENTITY IS NOW ABOLISHED

ELIMINATION WE HAVE ACHIEVED
FROM FROM THE POWER OF MANS GREED
RUINS HERE AND THAT IS IT
EARTH IS LEFT A PILE OF SHIT
