Iâve never heard the voice of god, Iâve found no trace of heaven either.
Since I was spared in hell I repay the old chaplain that saved me.
I spend my days with the good book, follow every chapter, prayer and verse.
I spend my nights with my vices just to find some proof in the words.

Iâve never heard the voice of god, Iâve found no trace of heaven either.
To try and forget my time in hell, I raise a glass to the saint that saved me.
I spend my days with the bottle, lie in every chapter, prayer and verse.
My nights spent burying demons to find some weight in the words.

Please let me find some weight in the words.
Please let me find some weight in the words.

Please let me find some weight in the words.
Please let me find some weight in the words.

Lord, let me down. Lord, let me down.
I find no proof in the words, no vestige of hope or the lord.
Lord, let me down, lord. Lord, let me down.
I find no proof in the words, no vestige of hope or the lord.
Lord, let me down, lord. Lord, let me down.
Let me down, lord. Let me down.
