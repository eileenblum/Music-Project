The days since we last spoke turned to weeks, turned to months, turned to years
You were heavy with child with your arms around a stranger in fear
I had the burn in my blood, I had the ash in my veins,
Had the lies I keep hid between teeth
The boy must never know about me, never know of my face.
Between us, hold these secrets we keep
My penance, in your name

"Hail Mary, have mercy
I dread the loss of heaven, living in hell
Forgive me my Father, for I am a sinner"

Rain taps on the window. Burning red neon sign pushes its way through the blinds
Sleep never comes easy. Sinking guts, lacking faith and on the nod every night
Dim glow of the street lights, forgotten tenement for the damned
No cut of the cloth here, just another broken man, waiting, praying for death

My penance in your name
My penance in your name

"Hail Mary, have mercy
I dread the loss of heaven, living in hell
Forgive me my Father, for I am a sinner"
