Crows sing, early morning
Just before sunrise
Our night spent with the guilt
Until morning light

We share a cigarette, burdens and shame
Our lungs heavy in bliss
Our arms sore from the weight
I may be a sinner, forsaken and damned
Selfish with pride for the touch of her hand

Our lips speak in secrets
Our tongues lie in verse
Our hearts slow with the guilt
Our love our only recourse

We share a cigarette, burdens and shame
Our lungs heavy in bliss
Our arms sore from the weight
I may be a sinner, forsaken and damned
Selfish with pride for the touch of her hand

And I will hold you close with the ebb and flow
Though the tides may turn, we won't
And I will hold you tight like an anchor line
Through the cruelest seas at night

And I will hold you close with the ebb and flow
Though the tides may turn, we won't
And I will hold you tight like an anchor line
Through the cruelest seas at night

We share a cigarette, burdens and shame
Our lungs heavy in bliss
Our arms sore from the weight
I may be a sinner, forsaken and damned
Selfish with pride for the touch of her hand

"Keep me like an old tune, something borrowed and blue
Bury me sound asleep beneath the boards in your room.
I love you still and true.
So watch me move at your will
Just like the tides for the moon."
