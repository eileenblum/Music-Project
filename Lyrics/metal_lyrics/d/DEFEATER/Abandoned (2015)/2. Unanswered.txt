I was a good man once, I was a good man once
But years of unanswered prayers have left me faithless
I was a good man once but now hopeless and abandoned
I was a good man once, I was a good man once
But years of serving in hell have left me faithless
I was a good man once but now hopeless and abandoned
Now hopeless and abandoned
Hopeless and abandoned

I was a good man once, I was a good man once
But years of unanswered prayers have left me faithless
I was a good man once but now hopeless and abandoned
I was a good man once, I was a good man once
But years of serving in hell have left me faithless
I was a good man once but now hopeless and abandoned

I let the pain in my head to the veins in my arms to rush
I feel the burn in my blood in my lungs in my chest collapse
I feel the ache in my guts as the memories and hurt flood back
When all I want to feel, when all I want to feel is nothing

I let the pain in my head to the veins in my arms to rush
I feel the burn in my blood in my lungs in my chest collapse
I feel the ache in my guts as the memories and hurt flood back
When all I want to feel, when all I want to feel

I was a good man once, I was a good man once
But years of unanswered prayers have left me faithless
I was a good man once but now hopeless and abandoned
I was a good man once, I was a good man once
But years of serving in hell have left me faithless
I was a good man once but now hopeless and abandoned
Now hopeless and abandoned. hopeless and abandoned

Forgive me, my father, for I am a sinner
Unanswered, abandoned, unanswered, abandoned
Forgive me, my father, for I am a sinner
Unanswered, abandoned, unanswered

I was a good man once
