I walk in shadows and darkness
I feel the feel of the sand
My words are calloused and poisoned
Easy work, the more idle the hand

Cover my tracks to the pulpit
The back alleys, my arms
My veins are thinning and poisoned
Lying tongues in mouths of snakes, guile charm

I feel the feel of the sand
I feel the feel of the sin
I feel the feel of the sand
I feel the feel

Breathe addiction and darkness
I feel the smoke in my lungs
My lips spit venom and poison
All lies except when speaking of love

Cover my ears to the ringing
To the memories and pain
Her voice ,like the singing of sirens
Drown myself among the rocks and the waves

I feel the feel of the sand
My veins, the touch of her hands
I feel the feel of the sin
The acid touch of her hand
I feel the feel of the sand
My veins, the touch of her hands
I feel the feel of the sin
I feel the feel

In my hour of darkness
I feel the feel of the sin
My wounds are calloused and poisoned
Easy work, the more idle the hand
Cover my tracks to a pulpit
The back alleys, my arms
My veins are thinning and poisoned
Lying tongues in mouths of snakes, guile charm

I feel the feel of the sand
Pray to the dirt for repent
I feel the feel of the sin
My veins, the touch of her hands
