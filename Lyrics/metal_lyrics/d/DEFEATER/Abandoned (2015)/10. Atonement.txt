Iâve been slipping away
Iâve been losing the days
Iâve been letting my vices drink from me
No Holy Spirit, no resurrection
Iâve been hoping on death, faith forgotten in theft
Years of heartache and guilt haunting my sleep
No Holy Spirit, no salvation

Hopeless and abandoned
Hopeless and abandoned

I've been waiting a lifetime to hear that voice
Speaking quiet and low, carries the weight of the world
I can hear him helpless between words
I've been paying a lifelong sins penance

Speaking quiet and low, lay down the weight of the world
Find some solace and comfort in the words

"What brings you here my son?
What brings you here my son?"

Hopeless and abandoned
Hopeless and abandoned

Iâve been slipping away
Iâve been losing the days
Iâve been letting the needle bleed from me
No Holy Spirit, no resurrection
Iâve been hoping on death, faith forgotten in theft
Years of heartache and guilt haunting my sleep
No Holy Spirit, no salvation

Hopeless and abandoned
Hopeless and abandoned
