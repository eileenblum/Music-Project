Let's talk about the old days Let's talk about your friends Let's talk about the summer And how you wished it wouldn't end Did I forget to tell you how pretty you looked in that dress? And the first time that I saw you, you cleaned the mess from my head And I don't mind if we take our time No, I don't mind Let's go walking on the boardwalk Dip my feet into the sea Let's find ourselves lost for hours Until we find ourselves a drink Let's talk that sun into setting Just need the sound of your voice I need that calming and the comfort Something to drown out the noise And I don't mind if we take our time 'Cause I'm all yours if you're all mine Something I've been meaning to tell you For about three years and a day I'd very much like to get married Maybe have kids and move away 'Cause there ain't nothing like your smile, your legs and those eyes And I will beg and steal and borrow to keep you save your whole life And I don't mind if we take our time 'Cause I'm all yours if you're all mine
