He put their father into the ground. Watching his mother cry over the man that provided for the three of them cut into him. Made him into the working man he was. Bury him in the cold wet ground. Familiar faces would have made him proud. The military and the working man, the history of the life he lived. "Can you feel that soil covering your coffin?" So what are you going to do? Be the hero that your father was, be the man he made you to be? You are your father's son, dear father. The war-torn stories that he told you, you've got a hell of a lot to live up to. An airborne man with a scar and wound, "Never make a promise that you can't prove." You are your father's son, dear father. "Where are you? You coward."
