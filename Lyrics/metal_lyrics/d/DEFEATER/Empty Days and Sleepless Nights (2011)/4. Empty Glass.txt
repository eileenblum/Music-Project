Him and the boys at work went out afterwards to this place called the Copper Coin. The old wood and brick walls made it feel like home. He found himself down at the Coin more that he would have liked. Staying later and later with each visit, even after the boys would go home to their girls. That's all he wanted, a pretty girl to come home to. A familiar face that wouldn't leave. And one night she was just sitting there, alone and unaware. He had never seen a prettier thing in his life. That was that, he had made up his mind. After a few drinks they walked home, and that's the way it was for years. The way she looked at you, tears streaming down her face. You felt the brush of her dress as she walked away. And that's all it took, sat down to buy her a drink. An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same. And that's the way that it's been, years later she took your name. Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her. Another night at the Copper Coin. Tell me about the old days. Another night at the Copper Coin. Put the sun into the sea. Because there ain't nothing like your smile, your legs and those eyes. And I will beg and steal and borrow to keep you safe for your whole life.
