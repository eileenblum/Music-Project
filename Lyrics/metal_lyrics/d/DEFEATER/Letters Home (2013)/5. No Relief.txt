Waking up safe and sound
The words could hardly leave my mouth
"How did I make it out alive?"
I love the same sleep every night

"How did I make it out alive?"

I got your letter today
And when I heard my name
My stomach sand to the floor
I can't take anymore
I'm digging my own grave

And it read "Dear John"
I knew this day would come
I'm drinking every drip until nothing will stop
Until you pull that rig from your arm

A wise man once told me
There wil be no relief
We will never be freeÂ 
Of the horrible thingsÂ 
And the pain that we've seen

And that same man was told

"No matter where we may roam
You forget what you know of
That life you once lived
Because your home ain't never home"

I got your letter today
And when I heard my name
My stomach sand to the floor
I can't take anymore
I'm digging my own grave

And it read "Dear John"
I'm drinking every drip until the ache will stop
And it read "Dear John"
