Another day when the sun ain't shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting, still breathing by a thread, still holding on [x2]

To my demons
To every dying wish I've had of us leaving
This ghost town still draggins us down
To pull you out of this hell you've been living in with the needle

Every dying wish I've had that you would clean up
Your lips, your let downs pulling me underground
With every tired lie you tell just to fill your heart.

You thin your veins with the dirt, with the hurt, with the memories of the pain

Still hoping, still waiting, still breathing by a thread, still holding on

And I lost my faith in your god, in your word, in every promise that you break

Still hoping, still waiting, still breathing by a thread, still holding on

So I walk the same way home each night to find that back alley pusher and take his life
And I ain't ashamed for what I've done
I'll take an eye for an eye until every junkie is blind
The river bed hold the blood and the knife

And I ain't ashamed for what I've done
I took his eye as a prize
The man who laid with my wife
Lays at the bottom of that river where the sun never shines

Another day when the sun ain't shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting, still breathing by a thread, still holding on
