Dear old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again
I'm giving in to my vices bottle in hand

Dear old friend
I think I'm slipping again
At the end of my rope with this pain in my head

I could use your sage old advice
Some word to calm me down
I ain't been sleeping much nights
With my girl sleeping all over town

Short list of my enemies
Since days I spent in the trench
But he ain't no man, he's a cheat
A coward staring down death

Dear old friend
In this letter I'll never send
I confess I'd kill them both where they stand

Dear old friend
You only get what you give
At the end of our love this pain is begging [?] my head

I could use your sage old advice
Some word to calm me down
I ain't been sleeping much nights
With my girl sleeping all over town

Short list of my enemies
Since days I spent in the trench
But he ain't no man, he's a cheat
A coward staring down death

My old friend, my old friend, my old friend, my old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again

On the front lines
I watched as good men died
I left a piece of me in foreign country side
And in my own home, I'm a stranger now
I was a husband once
Lies built on losing ground [x2]

My old friend, my old friend, my old friend, my old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again [x2]
