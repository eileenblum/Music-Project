I hope this finds you well
A father lost and mother dear
The family that's kept me here
Heartless and cold, and I've learned it well
How to loose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say
"I never raised a hand to the ones I love."
Now look at how
You beg and pray
For your god and his grace
To keep you safe
To save you from me

My broken spirit and back
My calloused, shaking hands
The ache I carry in me
My grief and skeletons
The weight you carried inside
A weight that held my bloodline
Black out the sunlight
I count these burdens as mine
And still all you see is that bastard in me

Believing in hell
A father lost and mother dear
The family that I squandered here
Heartless and cold, and I forgot it all
How to loose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say
"I never raised a hand to the ones I love."
But I remember how
You begged and prayed
For your god and his grace
To keep you safe
To save you from me

My broken spirit and back
My calloused, shaking hands
The ache I carry in me
My grief and skeletons
The weight you carried inside
A weight that held my bloodline
Black out the sunlight
I count these burdens as mine
And still all I see is that bastard in me
