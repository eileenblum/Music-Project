September, 1969. 

he found himself waiting again. 
out at the crossroads, out on the lam. 
this time not running, this time by right. 
a road-side hitcher waits for headlights. 
"the blues,
the blues
the blues won't bring me down."
that pick-up truck stopped. 
"where you headed, kid?"
"back to the boardwalk coast to fix the wrong i did."
that old man would bring him just as far as he could.
his hellhound sniffing out for a trace of any good.
the hope
the hope
the hope he's chasing. 
the blues
the blues
the blues he carried are dead and buried.
