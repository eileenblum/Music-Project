he walks the streets collar up to the snowfall.
holes in pockets and knees.
sleeps in bar rooms and horse stalls.
but you can't stay too long in one place.
"move along kid, we don't like your face."
mother's hold children close out of fear.
father's curse under breath as they sneer.
and he walks the streets, years pass by with the snowfall.
time is wasted in drink,
days begging and lost souls.
holds no merit in vagrants in boxcars.
down in hell you best know who your friends are.
"not so proud scrounging for your next meal.
no alibis sold when with devils you deal.
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel to be all alone with no direction?
home's never home,
it's just the place where you came from.
home's never home,
it's just the place where you came from.
home's never home,
it's just the place where you came from.
home's never home,
writ on walls of the church and the hostels.
"home is never home," said by martyrs and lost souls.
"home is never home," said the prophet in plain clothes
as he strummed his guitar. and he screamed, and he sang.

"we'll i've been tired
cause' i don't sleep so well on trains
well i got ups and downs
but days are all the same
i've been low
but it never gets me down

well i've been thrown out
i've been let down 
i've been chased
well i've hardships
i've been stripped of pride and name
i've been low
but it never gets me down

and nights spent drinking
all the worry from my head
and days spent wandering
wishing i was dead
if i could only muster 
the words out from my mouth
i would sing
oh i would sing
i'll take the next train out

cause i've been hopin'
i've been praying theres some god
so when i die
i'm found and saved
and i'm not lost
cause all he's done
all for me
is take away the ones i love

and nights spent drinking
all the worry from my head
and days spent wandering
wishing i was dead
if i could only muster 
the words out from my mouth
i would sing
oh i would sing
i'll take the next train out

i'm gonna take it"
