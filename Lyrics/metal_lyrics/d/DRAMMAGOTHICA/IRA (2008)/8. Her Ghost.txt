I say what I fell
I forget my thoughts
And the way is the same
I can live behind
Under this glass moon
I forget my life

I feel breathin'
I fell shoutin'
All my...
My own life
Over my own life

I say what I feel
I forget my needs
And the way is not the same
I can't live behind

Oh my secret's living into my head
Oh my secret's living trough my head

Over my eyes
You can see the pain,
And your game is so cruel
We lose in vain...
