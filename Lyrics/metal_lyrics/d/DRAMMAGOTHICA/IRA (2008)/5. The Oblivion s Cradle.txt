In the spirited memory of passion who burned
A life's emotion swing on the sharp trickle
Of memory and they're shaded by (they are shared by...)

She/he wants suffocated me

Crystal's mask of hypocrisy falls
It's hided in the eyes of conceited man
It has not sense this voyage

I'm arrived at doubt's crossroad
The mournful hope abash itself
My thoughts slide away...far...faded by the time

She/he wants suffocated me

Crystal's mask of hypocrisy falls
It's hided in the eyes of conceited man
It has not sense this voyage

The oblivion's cradle...
