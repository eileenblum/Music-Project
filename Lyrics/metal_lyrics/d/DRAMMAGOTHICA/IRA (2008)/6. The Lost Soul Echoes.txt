It's raining black thoughts
From a dream's shadow
Who never could replace (your last breath).

Don't try to ignore,
Don't try to escape,
He's there ready to catch,
Is the breath you'd never listen.

Is a light in the haze that blinds phobia
It incites my heart dispelled in a sin
It's a painful a painful night
It's a feary scream
Just don't observing and I can see you.

Don't care of the shadow heaving you
A long fly in the horizon.

Lost in the clouds
It's the new era coming
It's the new era
It's the end without beginning
