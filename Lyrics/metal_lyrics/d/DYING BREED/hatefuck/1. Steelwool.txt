Steelwool rubdown
Scoured down revealing
You're the source peeled off civility a reliance:
on abuse roots exposed violence expelled upgrade fear
Thank you, dear friend giving me direction motherfucker
Peels the ability
A reliance:on abuse crutchless thorns piercing clearly upgrade fear
And destroy
So you want a little piece of me so you want to take a swing at me well here i am fuck
Straight to the floor
It is the past taught loveless steelwool rubdown
Scoured down revealing
You're the source peeled off civility a reliance:on abuse roots exposed violence expelled upgrade fear
And destroy
All false convictions
I justify slight to the side freed with connections
And fists
It's motherfucking healthy from the wayside
Unknown blame
Taste the restraints of hate from the wayside
Unknown blame
Taste the restraints of hate
