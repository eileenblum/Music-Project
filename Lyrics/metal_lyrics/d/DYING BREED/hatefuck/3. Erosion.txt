Stature
Inside
Erodes
Another fucking scarring
Untold
Punished
Grovel
Untold
Listless prime
Flooding
Baseline regrets
A vow you'll never slice me down flowing stopped
This oxbowed discharge
I beat you when i broke and the rage came rushing rise from the leers
Your friends
Your thoughts
They don't mean nothing released leers
Your friends
Your thoughts
Don't mean nothing isolation
Seeps into my hand attenuation
Leaching does not cleanse and what you said
And what you did you made me
I'll love you i'll hate you i'll kill it isolation
Stemming from the bend attenuation
Weakness, bled
And what you said
And what you did you made me
I'll hate you i'll hate you
And it won't stop cored the niche another dose of coma phrased as torture phrased from fear
My sight, my sight returns
My sight, my sight, my sight returns your face
The ending your face
