[Lyrics &amp; music: Pat Johnson &amp; Andrew Prietto]

A life joke
And i'm so sick of this
A monument
To the shared disdain
I want to die tonight
Seething
Frequently execute emotions hatefucked
A bag a night for love
Fertilized
A stagnant heart pumps blood ignore to paste offense
Seething
Frequently scar myself cauterized
Regrets
The faceless blame leeching
It flows away regrets
The nature tamed entrenched
It flows away bludgeoned
Within this nuisance bludgeoned
Within this nuisance lyrics: pat johnson
