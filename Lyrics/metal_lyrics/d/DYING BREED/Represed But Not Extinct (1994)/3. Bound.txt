[Music: Pat Johnson]
[Lyrics: Pat Johnson &amp; Andy Prietto ]

Now comes the consequence
The love for life has died fear plagues 
The innocence the tears you bled were lies
Your hopes and dreams were there before you arms fell short of reach 
Now death intrigues the mind
And life falls short to teach chapter of misery
Promised eternity
Now comes the glory
The past kills love of life soul dies in agony
Wounds cut, no knife
Your hopes and dreams were there before you arms fell short of reach now death intrigues the mind
And life falls short to teach the lurking destiny
Of tangled hate
Can't choke the breathless beast the gracious fallacy
'Give everything'
I'm left empty
Guilt no more... Guilt guilt no more guilt embraceless
Bound at the knees forget the past destruction
From the lies, fused in hate from the lies, fused in hate feed on lies
Fuck your lies refuse it refuse it refuse it refuse it guilt
