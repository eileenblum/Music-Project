Masked
Who wears the title
Death masks anonymous
As breathing stops within this concrete holocaust
Carved inside
Carved inside
Carved inside
Ostracized for no crime
Textured deep with benefit
Idly take my breath my friend deftly place the roots upon the cellblocks
Poisoned offspring crawl upon the grieving carve me up and count the rings
Betrayal turns to blight
Darkness dims the days lost those holy nights wasted were those days
When blindness his weary eyes life's caustic charms
Now find pain
Justify, killing time
Feast upon the branchless limbs control turns to skill, my friend deftly place the roots upon the cellblocks
Poisoned offspring crawl upon the grieving carve me up and count the rings
Take away the pain
Take away the pain take away the pain take away the pain
As the hand languished to the matrix greed
Maul the obstacles, lost ability control is what you breathe, so
Take away the pain take away the pain take away the pain
