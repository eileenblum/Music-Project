[Lyrics: Pat Johnson]

Another notch upon the drainpipe repressed but not extinct
A forced pry with nothing left but blame i i will not
Submit to numbness
Gripping throatless curled in agony
Fight the damaged one i will not submit fight the damaged one i will not submit
Fight'fight'fight'fight'fight' fight'fight'fight'fight'fight'
With five minutes, so much change
I can never be the same
Fight
Shadows burnt on flesh
A plankless walk over chanceless bruised syntax
I won't submit my fucking life to this
