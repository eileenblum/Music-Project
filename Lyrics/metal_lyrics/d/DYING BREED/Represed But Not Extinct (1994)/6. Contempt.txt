[Lyrics: Pat Johnson &amp; Aaron Snow]

This is my times' genocide
Ignorant minds
We stand proudly
Crawling in
Unions
Of mass hatred
Voiced as unity
Adaptive complaints manifest
Learn to blame others for mistakes that don't exist
Breeding
Dying contempt
Voiced
The useless need
Feeding
Inspired heartless revelations cage the souls
Pour prejudice into the holes
Fill the holes
Wasteful attempts approach the lost and the powerless
You teach the child's mind
Steal the soul for the tribe and point the finger of hate
Hope to never feel this way again hope to never feel this way again 
so you lost your world
In this bed of hate
Left with lies
And nothing
The paradox of lies the paradox of lies
