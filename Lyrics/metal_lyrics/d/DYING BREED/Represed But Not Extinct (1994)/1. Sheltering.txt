[Lyrics: Pat Johnson]

Internal cries that never die
They grant the suffering you mute the screams
That fleeting moment's everything
A time i can rise past the lavish of this thick disguise
Where suppression becomes art
Thrown from the mind is this hate that can't survive
"waiting for"
Sheltering ....... Sheltering
Sifting through the soulless greed transcend the masochists
You taught me more
Than the judgement of the fists
A time i can rise past the lavish of this thick disguise
Where suppression becomes art
Thrown from the mind is this hate that can't survive
"waiting for"
Sheltering ....... Sheltering
I need those answers that you free
My sheltering
I need those answers that you free
My sheltering
Internal cries that never die
They grant the suffering you mute the screams
That fleeting moment's everything
A time i can rise past the lavish of this thick disguise
Where suppression becomes art
Thrown from the mind is this hate that can't survive
"waiting for"
Sheltering ...... Sheltering
To overcome my fears to overcome my fears to overcome my fears 
to overcome my fears
I realize now i need the strength to let you in
Then it's gone
