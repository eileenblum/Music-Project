[Music: Pat Johnson]
[Lyrics: Pat Johnson]

A view from the outside apportioned grief
Cut the down time enforced rage
Mock the carnage
Lost life
Grinning
The choice is made another loss
Another fall
Mock the carnage
Lost life
Grinning
The choice is made
Slice away at the denial and constraints it seems the only escape
Keeps you from
Restraints
Now the only thing that you can see comes the only thing you can see now slice away at the denial and constraints it seems the only escape
This was not your only answer
This was not your only answer another falling
The grief collides
Another loss
