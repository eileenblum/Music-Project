I want to wish you
A happy prison term
Those days were numbered
Forget now
Feed me nubbies, motherfucker
Into the empty fold
Feed me nubbies, motherfucke
Feed the hunger of the rubby whore
To feel you near
Perched outside my cage
To feel you near:
Greetings, same thing, motherfuck, yeah
Listen, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Empty, empty, empty, empty
Resource:notched down trinket
Resource:mined to nothing
Fleeting, same thing, motherfuck, yeah
Listen, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Empty, empty, empty, empty
Resource:notched down trinket
Resource:mined 'til nothing
Groan growls and bows to unrest
To pay the fees
And excised
From the daze, from the daze
Groan growls and bows to unrest
Affords the fees
Yet excised
From the daze, from the daze
Leaving, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Leaving, motherfuck, ending, yeah
Empty, empty, empty, empty
Cringe past the next time
The broken cast
Double up eleven
Fosters up another loss:
