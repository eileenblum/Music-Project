Romance the stoned
With squirrly, squirm smiles
The brethren fallen
Like treeless leaves left swollen
Wretch, wretch, wretch
But pickup
New foe revival
The 16th coming
Let the games bleed:
Evel Knievel and Bruce Lee
Genetically:speaking
Babydoll, who's your daddy?
Sprinkle the damned
With tribal claims
Forfeit the savior
And mop the mouth with grout
Wretch, wretch, wretch
But sit up
The sickness quelled like a gel
For us
For them
Myself:
Evel Knievel and Bruce Lee
Genetically:speaking
Babydoll, who's your daddy?
