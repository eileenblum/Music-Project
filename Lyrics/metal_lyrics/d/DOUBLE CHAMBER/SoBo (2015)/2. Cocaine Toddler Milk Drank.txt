Why?
What?
Who?
When?
Where?

The questions that go and strip bare
Life, is a fucking illusion
It plays fair when you don't care
You get the answers to all of the above
But when you search you find fucking NO love
And it triggers that sense of failure
When you just realize how lonely you are
..But everyone can relate
SO WHAT THE FUCK, ARE WE NOT TRULY ALONE?!
I need a place for where my dome can atone to the pain it owns

The transmissions
To the system Is to satisfy all divisions
Take the time to listen
Twist the systems they will glissin
But keep in mind "Are you lying?"
Ah, FUCK!!
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'M LOSING MY MIND!!!
GET A GRIP, MAN!
Gotta keep in time
Fucking step in line!
NO FEAR IN YOUR MIND
You can do this! YEAH?!?!
Aw FUCK YEAH!!!!!!
How am I meant to speak without guns?
How am I meant to speak without guns?

This is a bullshit way to die
My back will be
FUCKED
At 50 and, a high chance I'll be blind
But I guess that's just normal life
And I think we're a lot closer to the fine line
Of bringing back a chaos of a life time
Because people can only break so much
Pretending to be happy
When most of us will..
Accomplish a whole lot of nothing

So lets just fuck shit up
Cause I've had enough of this no hand touch
I WANT IT ALL!
SO BRING IT!
