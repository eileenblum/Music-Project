I see you probing
Searching for clues
Reaching to the depths
The inside of you
Learning what's behind you
Leaping to the past
Bringing back those memories
You never thought would last

Then it all floods back
Not one concept can define who you are and where you're going
But its been a wild ride
Maybe one day you will wake
And it will all be a distant dream

The moment that you are living
Irrelevant
No matter how important it seems
Weeks rinse out the days
And the months turn to years
But your brain holds on to everything

Then it all floods back
Not one concept can define who you are, where you're going
But its been a wild one day you will wake
And it will all be a distant dream
There's a war coming and it's up to you
Where it starts
And how it ends that night

Just drop the act and live in mirrors

Now and then it all floods back
Not one concept can define you are and where you're going
And you can say that it's been a wild ride
But one day you will wake
And I swear you will hate every moment
I am truth.
I am the liar.
