Is it against them?
Is it them against me?
Is it you against us?
Is it us against you?
Is it all against none
If it gives into some?

I am given a choice
Either be it
Harm
Or
Befriend
The shoulder angels that unwillingly live in my head "There's 2 of us and 1 of you"
that's what my conscience said
"It's up to you"
"who do you choose?"
"Be careful where you tread"
It restarts and I reset
And if I give you the opportunity
You do it again
You come to me visible in my dreams
and I remember you
Because you are me
And I say so much
Yet I hold my tongue when I am told to
"Speak"
Take it back
And it takes back
How many times
I've wanted to die
Couldn't add up for the times
I've done right
But still festering
A moral crime
That's never in play
But always on side
Fucking
1
2
3
"You better welcome me"
"On your feet and feel defeat"
"Cause now we all"
"We have control"
GET THE FUCK OUT
FUCK OFF
FUCK ME
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU
FUCK ALL OF YOU
How many times have I wanted to die?
Does it still add up right this time?
I JUST TOLD YOU TO GET THE FUCK OUT

Cause I can't keep my mind from going into dark places
I try to run
But I never get far
I AM STUCK
And it's the same reason I stay
I wake up prepared to betray the day
Yet, the only fucking time I was ever positive
Was when I lost it all
And couldn't give a shit

How do I control
How do I control me?
