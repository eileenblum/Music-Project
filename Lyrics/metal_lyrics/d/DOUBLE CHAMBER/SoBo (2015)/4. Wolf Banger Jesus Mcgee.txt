Your perception of time
Is the only thing that defines
What you do and how you do it
If you wait in life's line If you skip the seconds
And round off the minutes
You're left with the hours
And that's all you've been given
So take your chances
Then take some more
Make the most of what's in stock before it is gone
For death is not the only pain time can't fix
Regret hurts until we
Learn to cope and set it aside
But it never leaves the back of our minds
It's the scars on your heart
That tear you apart
I'm talking to YOU
Yes,
YOU
Whoever is listening through
Take a few minutes to look back
And see the change
I've instilled in you
Don't deny it
For the first time be true
To YOURSELF
For YOURSELF
NO ONE ELSE
BUT
YOU
Were you the glass that everyone saw through?
Or were you the bait for everyone to chew?
When the devil kicks
You will be on cloud nine
The whole attack is to realise there is no sky up above
Just the rain that's to come
So you turn to guilty pleasures
When it's just not enough
And those scars on your hearts that tore you apart
Are never seen again

Send your god to the lions

Well it all goes to shit when clock stop to click
And you will know what to do
As it enters your mind

Send your god to lions
