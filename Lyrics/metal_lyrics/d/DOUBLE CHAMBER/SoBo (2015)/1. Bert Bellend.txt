Dangle meat on a stick
Quick, pick bit by bit
Now sit and drift
Feed is over
Do ya feel sick?
A craving so strong
Believe, it talks to me
Served as a joker
But I acted like a king
Conversations to myself
Boarder line skitsofrantic
Lost my control and left us in automatic
Under the impression that the truth is inside the static Get me out of here, now
Or lose me within the panic

I feel invisible

Scrambling Rambling
Too many thoughts
Can't fucking handle em
They're demanding
That I start planning
The mastered the art of dismantling
Its gone past the point of fixation
Now I'm just waiting and pacing
put ya teeth to curb
And stomp with out hesitation
1 2 3 4

I feel invincible
