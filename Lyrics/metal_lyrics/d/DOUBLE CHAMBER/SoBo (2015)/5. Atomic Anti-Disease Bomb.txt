I forever cast a spell on thee
For piece of mind
That you'll be fine
From you to me there is hope I get to sleep
And some dreams Its only you that I see
For its only you that I want to see

Please can you let her go?
I'm begging you
Stop standing in the blind side
I know its you
One more time
Picture a movie like a bullet in your head
The plot is you've already died and sequelled to live again

Repeated dreams
That I'm repeating dreams
And dreaming I'm repeating
Repeats in my dreams

Back when we were young
Together, we only wanted love
That was all I ever got from you
And though you're gone
IT WONT LEAVE ME ALONE!
Think happy thoughts and fly away with me
Just close your eyes and drink
I give up.
I'm calling it in.
Cause just as I feel whole
The sunlight reminds me Its not real..
I brought you back for a sense of understanding
That you are the air to all of us
BUT IF YOU CAN HURT ME
HOW CAN YOU SAY
THAT I HAVE GONE TOO FAR?!

"If you love them, Let them go"
The hardest statement I have ever known
Cause if you love them
Let them know

I forever cast a spell on thee for piece of mind
That you'll be fine
From you to me there is hope
That I get to sleep
And some dreams its only you that I see
For its only you that I wanna see
Why does everything I ever try to love
Bring me to my knees?
