We are
Still slaves
It's no conspiracy
Nothing has changed
Under supremacy
It's been said a thousand times
I'll say it again
I've had a dream
AND IT'S THE END
We escape reality
For a nightmare
Believing everything we hear
They've made us scared of our own voice
We still live by your choice

Even when the sun
Burns one by one
The damage was done
when you helped us run
Even when the son
Was nailed one by one
The damage was done
When you thought you won

YOU WILL BRING THE HATRED
CLAIM US FORSAKEN
BRAND US OXYGEN WASTERS

The Devil is not here, yet
But he will walk these streets
You bastards won't see him
'Cause he will tempt your greed
As he breaks down those walls
You THINK you're holding up
Believe these words
What else have you fucking got?
Your goods at will collapse
When THEY have had enough

IMPERIAL
WON'T LET US GO

Obsession for eyes
Blind all human life
Obsession to die
This casket is just right

And still we will fight as we
March on through the night
Holding pride
We won't live by your lies
WE WON'T LIVE BY YOUR LIES

You haven't stopped us from saying
"NO"
MOTHER FUCKER
(IMPERIAL)
How does it feel to know
We no longer suffer?
(IMPERIAL)
What ever happened to your excessive power?
(IMPERIAL)
TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLOCK
IT'S YOUR FINAL HOUR.
