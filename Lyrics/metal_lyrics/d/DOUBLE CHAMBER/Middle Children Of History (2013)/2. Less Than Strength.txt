Maybe its not about you see
And maybe this is not about all I will be
'Cause I close my eyes
One second
I will trust you tonight
You'll realize who you knew did not survive

My chest begins to tighten
Look me in the eyes and say I'm "okay"
You can go FUCK your sunshiny day
Nothing is as perfect as you claim

It's not YOUR life
I do see the darker side of truth inside the mind
A conscience you deny

Maybe its not about me (you deny)
Something that you can't see (you deny)
It still keeps happening (you deny)
Its just the same old thing

And this has happened all before
History will repeat itself again
How can I look forward when its already been?
I will breathe this smoke tonight

No one knows the wiser I smile outside these doors
Yet
In this 4 walled head space I'm searching

Turn around
Close your eyes
Shut your mouth
LISTEN

How can I breathe when all that you've left me is
LESS THAN STRENGTH
HOW CAN I BREATHE WHEN ALL THAT YOU'VE LEFT ME IS
LESS THAN STRENGTH
how can I breathe?
how can I see?
Less than strength

I'll be okay when you get the fuck out of my face

OUT OF MY FACE
