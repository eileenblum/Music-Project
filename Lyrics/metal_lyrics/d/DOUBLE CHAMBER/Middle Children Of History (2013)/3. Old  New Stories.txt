Justify the mistakes of time
The great depression
The greatest generation
Who fought and died for us to survive
Saw the true horrors before they arrived
Now move on to the lucky few
Destined to follow what their fathers do
War machines was all knew
Death was life
Sad but true

Death is a place for the living

Life cycles won't stop spinning
Pick up the trend that's being repeated
Each generation broken down and beaten
Life is a place for the grieving
Cycles go on stop spinning
What we'll do with our last breath
Isn't up to us its up to them

The baby boomers
The special ones
Given privileges
Still more to come C
Creation of a stable freedom
After free love, drugs and sex

What could fucking possibly come next?
GEN X

Death is a place for the living

Life cycles won't stop spinning
Sick of the trend that's being repeated
Each generation broken down and beaten
Life is a place for the grieving
Cycles go on stop spinning
What we'll do with our last breath
Isn't up to us its up to them

Old new stories
Creates who we are
Have we forgotten the path of our origin?
Old new stories
Show us how we got this far
Have we forgotten the blood of all of us?

How the fuck can every body lose sight on who we are?
What we are,
We'll become enigma

Addiction to technology nearly killed us
To get the bigger, better, more
Comfortable enough for war

Old new stories
Lost all passion
What would they do if they still had their youth?
Old new stories
Told with poison
Disgusted at filth we've turned to
Old new stories
With no happy endings
