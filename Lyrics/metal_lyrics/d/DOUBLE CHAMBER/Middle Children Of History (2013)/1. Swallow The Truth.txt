YOU'RE A FUCKING BADASS MOTHER FUCKER
A HARDCORE COCK SUCKER
Is this war you're waging?
'Cause, we're overtaking
Destroying your precious scene
Your time has come
and already been, Punk

Don't put your head down
Unless it's for a reason
You're another trend
Another failed season

It's a shame
What you put your life through
I'd be lying if I said I don't pity you
It's a shame what you do
I still pity you
Punk

You spend a few months
Searching for a new 'cause
Now you've leached on to mine
You attention whore

It's a shame
What you put your life through
I still pity you

FUCK THIS PLACE UP

To all of you pussies
Who follow the same thing
I think I am going Insane

Cant I believe
That this bullshit
Has been placed in front of me?
Now we will scream
To the whole world
FUCK THE INDUSTRY

Cant I believe
That this bullshit
Has been placed in front of me?
Now we will scream
To the whole world
MOTHER FUCK THE INDUSTRY

It's a shame
What you put your life through
I'd be lying if I said I don't pity you
It's a shame what you do
I still pity you
