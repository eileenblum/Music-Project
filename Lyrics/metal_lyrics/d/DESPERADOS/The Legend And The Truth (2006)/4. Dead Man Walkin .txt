Standing at the burning house - memories going round
of what he's done and what should be -feels like falling down
emotions- keep on running wild, while loosing all around
life seems like a tragedy, lost what he found

packed up his belongings - saddle up his horse
left this town in agony - wouldn't turn around
a gunman on his way to hell - weile the sun is going down
has to do what must be done - dead man on the run

until the time has come - had to carry on
allways on the run - shadows of the past - it seems like a deadman walking

His loneliness is more than pain - draining out his heart
former leader of the pack - looking for a start
he used to work hard every day -rugged and handsome pale
salvation it has crossed his way with the one so hard to find

time of joy has been so short - and good has changed to bad
beloved wife died in a year - and took which her his lad
he don't know what he's fighting for - glory and for fame
he's past is buried in lamar - the whole world is to blame

until the time has come - had to carry on
allways on the run - shadows of the dead - it seems like a deadman
till the time has come - allways on the run -
until the time has come - shadows of the past -
well, it seems like a deadman

All his life, all his pride - the bleeding never ends
all this shadows of the dead, will get him now at last

Look for reasons in the planes - trouble's all he found
just a man of circumstance - gets back up the ground
the hangman has it's bloody rope - tied around his neck
the reaper's gonna have to wait - your number's not up yet

until the time has come - had to carry on
till the time has come - shadows of the dead - well it seems like a deadman WALKING
till the time has come - had to carry on
until the time has come - shadows of the dead -
well, it seems like a deadman walking WALKING - deadman walking WALKING - like a deadman walking WALKING
WALKING
