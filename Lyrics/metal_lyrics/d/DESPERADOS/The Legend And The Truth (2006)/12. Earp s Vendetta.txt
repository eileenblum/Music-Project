A loaded gun, a moving heart, some people think revenge the best part
better not more, keep your head down low, you know when he gets you, he'll do it
real slow

think if you may live or not, it take much more than you have got
raging uncontrolled......this is the

Earp's vendetta, it's gonna bring you down
this is the Earp's vendetta, judgement day has come

dressed in black, right on his way
you know he'll gets you, it's your turn to pay
a fist full of anger, so let's start to pray
the man in black has come to stay

think if you may live or not, it take much more than you have got
raging uncontrolled......this is the

Earp's vendetta, it's gonna bring you down
this is the Earp's vendetta, judgement day has come
