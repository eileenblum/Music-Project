Now the judgement day has come
clouds of hate will hide the sun
the seed of hate on fertile ground
who sow the wind will earn the storm
there's just a man that you can trust, a dead man walking through his past

The tongueless past now filled with sorrow
Infested like there's no tomorrow

At the OK Corral

Keep your hand close to your gun
no confidence in anyone
You've been looking for this fight
now be a man and do it right
smoke and blood gets in your eyes
when brotherhood will rise to fight

The tongueless past now filled with sorrow
Infested like there's no tomorrow

At the OK Corral
