Justice day, the time has come
silence before the final storm
sight by sight they marching straight
4 brothers face another fate

did not go to sleep last night
just waiting for the end of time
there's no way back, there's no return
now guns will talk and skies will burn
who felt the wind will earn the ...

storm will live inside their minds, nothing else can set them free
no guardience to draw the line and they know it's gonna be

the march to destiny

Behan got into their way, to give that scum security
he looked into the marshalls eyes and scared to death, he stepped aside
now this scum will have to pay and no one dare get in the way
here's the moment of the truth, throw up your hands don't try to move

storm will live inside their minds, nothing else can set them free
no guardience to draw the line and they know it's gonna be

the march to destiny
