My father had no time for me
Drunk was all that he could be
Used to beat my mama just to see
If her blood is red and warm like me

I Gotta put him six feet down
But I don't know where!

Now I'm old enough to know
My youth is what made me stonecold
That is all you need to know
Why people really hate me so

Dodge city is the town to be
On horseback my wild bunch and me
Playing cards drinking whisky
Till wyat came and stopped the heat

I Gotta put him six feet down
But I don't know where!

C'mon folks and dance with me
The hellbillysquare

This wyat is an angry man
The toughest marshal on this land
The last guy who wanted to stand
Found his cut off balls back in his hand

I Gotta put him six feet down
But I don't know where!

C'mon folks and dance with me
The hellbillysquare

He made us leave our guns or go
Dodge city ain't the same no more
Last night when I was with a whore
She said to me on thing's for sure

You ought to put him six feet down
And you should know where!

You Gotta make Marhall Earp
dance the hellbillysquare

You ought to put him six feet down
And you should know where!

You Gotta make Marhall Earp
dance the hellbillysquare
