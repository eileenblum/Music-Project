Take my hand and follow me - I'll open up your eyes
let's travel back in history - let's watch a legend rise
Wyatt never harmed a man - never took what was not his
the devil had another plan - his own dirty little list

People spread so many lies - but this here is the truth
Our journey's ending as he dies - beginning at his youth

Join me - I will show you show you - follow me - to the dust of history Oh yeah!

The loss of love teared out his heart - he lost his will to live
A good man had just turned to bad - he had no more to give
The man he was exists no more - he had to get it straight
With pride he fights upholds the law - powered by his hate

People spread so many lies - but this here is the truth
Our journey's ending as he dies - beginning at his youth so

Join me - I will show you - follow me yeah - to the dust of history
Trust me let me proof you - come with me to the dust of history yeah! Come
