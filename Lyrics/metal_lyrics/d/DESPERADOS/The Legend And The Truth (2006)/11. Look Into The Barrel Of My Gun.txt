down down shoot em all down, look into the barrel of a gun
down down shoot em all down, do you think your time has come

I tried to hold my, hold my head up high, you where the wight around my neck
when i spread out, spread out my wings to fly, you tore them right of my back

can you feel the power of my pain, come and show your face if you dare
I am bringing you

down down shoot em all down, look into the barrel of a gun
down down shoot em all down, do you think your time has come

I gotta meet ya, when clock strikes 12, I am gonnawipethat smile off your face
but i found you with a hole in your head, well i guess i came a bit to late

can you feel the power of my pain, come and show your face if you dare
I am bringing you

down down shoot em all down, look into the barrel of a gun
down down shoot em all down, do you think your time has come
