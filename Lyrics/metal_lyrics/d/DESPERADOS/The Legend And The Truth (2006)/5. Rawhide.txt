Rollin, rolling, rolling through the streams are swollen,
keep them doggies rolling rawhide
Rain and wind and weather, hellbent for leather,
wishing my girl was by my side
All the things I am missin, good vittals love and kissing,
are waiting at the end of my ride

move em on, head em up
head em up, move em on
move em on, head em up
Rawhide
Count em out, ride em in
Ride em in count em out
Count em out, ride em in
Rawhide

Keep moving, moving, moving, through they're disapproving
Keep them doggies moving
Rawhide
Don't try to understand em, just rope em, pull and brand em
Soon we'll be living high and wide, my heards calculating
My true love will be waiting, be waiting at the end of my ride
Hyaa!!!
