you pave the way for my robbing leech
there are no bounds and the souls are free
when rivers run backwards and the time stands still
you'll stand in my path than you will see

all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
of aggressions that leave you alone to your blood
evocation of everlasting brotherhood...

I'm tired of your slan-derous mockery
you're just a traitor without daredevilry
I have to face the man who wanna take my life
you know that I'm prepared for the fight

hey ho, the final row
mournful fatal misery
hey ho, the final row
with my gun and me

all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
of aggressions that leave you alone to your blood
evacation of everlasting brotherhood...

you see the tension in my staring eyes
look at my hand that's leap and strike
don't wait to long and stop to breathe
cause heaven awaits that somebody decease

all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
of aggressions that leave you alone to your blood
evocation of everlasting brotherhood...

hey ho, the final row
mournful fatal misery
hey ho, the final row
with my gun and me

we took a little trip just you and me
the lead that put us out of misery
no one will ever hold us in contempt
decision between the quick and the dead...
