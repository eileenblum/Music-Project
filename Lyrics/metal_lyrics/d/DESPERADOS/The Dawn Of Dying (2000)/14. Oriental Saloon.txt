searching for a lucky game
or been thirsty by the way
come on boys and listen to me
don't pray the god that you should see

a place where all the honest men
the desert mice, the desert rats -
wholesome honey, stay alive
if you are dry step in and try

we'll take you to the valley's green
you'll hear the distant fairy sing
pretty maids bear up your pall
walk in and find your chance for sale

forget the plagues within your life
in this hive we're all alive
right down the freemont street you'll find
the loyal and the proud unite

enjoy before you leave the town
and don't forget to turn around
make your path straight to the moon
oriental saloon

rattle your spurs and swing your legs
dancing to the girls request
come on fellow fill up your glass
to the health of our glorious class

see the splendid flowers grow
before the rain begins to fall
even whiskey to your mind
best that you will ever find

we'll take you to the valley's green
you'll hear the distant fairy sing
pretty maids bear up your pall
walk in and find your chance for sale

forget the plagues within your life
in this hive we're all alive
right down the freemont street you'll find
the loyal and the proud unite

enjoy before you leave the town
and don't forget to turn around
make your path straight to the moon
oriental saloon

the scrapping of the drunken boys
exuberance, ain't got no choice
are sinners now senseless grown
night careers they start to flow

the whipping of the willing whores
your soul can really wish no more
for noble hearts and blushing wimps
the outlaw rock'n'roll begins

we'll take you to the valley's green
you'll hear the distant fairy sing
pretty maids bear up your pall
walk in and find your chance for sale

forget the plagues within your life
in this hive we're all alive
right down the freemont street you'll find
the loyal and the proud unite

enjoy before you leave the town
and don't forget to turn around
make your path straight to the moon
oriental saloon
