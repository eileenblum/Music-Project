nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
sing the song
you better keep inside
with loaded guns
on holy ground
like a deadly punch
desperados in town

nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
don't try to be strong
don't even try to fight
for when we'll be gone
you might still be around
and you sing this song
'cause desperados in town

showdown has come
with deadly sound
it's a quick draw game
desperados in town

nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide...
