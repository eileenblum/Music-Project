[The Ballad Of Jesse James]

I dreamt I was in heaven
among the angel's gold
feeded by a pleasant hand
that dealt the playing cards
no sorts of bones whatever
creeping on the ground
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
now I just found a game
like a mortal upper story
play the final showdown scene
'til you are gone to glory
both friends and foes agree
accused of breaking laws
there is no money in this secret box
the fodder to my purse
maybe I am wrong
maybe I am right
maybe I'm not strong enough
maybe I will die
like a tawny snake
in a torrid clime
the twilight
'til the dawn of time
maybe I disclaim my honour
maybe I will jumping down the running train -
jumping down the running train
- jumping down the running train
the ballade of Jesse James
there was a little lady
she was twined in golden hair
don't want to take her to my heart
'cause dollars doesn't smell
she felt down on her knees
I cant forget the sound
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
from the deepground of the ocean
to the top of mountains high
where love threw up the sponge
fear got the upper hand
an insidious bullet from behind
the coffin let me learn
there's no money in this secret box
just fodder to the worms
maybe...
