So now bend down
Disposable and irrelevant
To feel the force, feel the pain
Feel hydraulic darkness.

Again and again
I am your only god now
As I hold the key of objective pain and pleasure.
Open up, spread the sinews for the releasing pressure

[Chorus:]
Oh, precious nervine 
For you I go the way of all flesh.
Intense flagellation shall combine us
Stay silenced

Her vibes wave my body
Sever the soul and let the flesh remain
And remember I am not god only when 
I hold the key into your heart

Enter the dirtiest grace
Lilith in you licks me
Enter the transcendental darkness
Your behaviour leads me.

I'm coming in with my intent of sin.
