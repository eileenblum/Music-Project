Fall o'poor wire dancer of life
Fall for entertainment.
Our ego is mesmerized by a malicious smile
Applause for the dying,
Survival is a disappointment...
Disappointment

[Chorus:]
I am the filth in angelform
Pregnant to the incompetent ideal of a citizen.
Ovums ruined by the seeds of the serpent
Stomach replaced by mother's womb.
Born for constant blasphemy

I am waiting for you in the purifying fire (Aesch Mezareph)
When Baalzephon looks at me through a mirror
Fail in my arms I won't catch you but I'll lie down next to you
To observe the reflections.
Like a parasite I am exquisite to eliminate souls.
Your interior - wretched by my cunning coctails
Irrelevant nihilist.
Depravity is my only goal
So enter in my envenomed paradise,
(just one taste of me and) you shall fail

I am purified
So hate me.
