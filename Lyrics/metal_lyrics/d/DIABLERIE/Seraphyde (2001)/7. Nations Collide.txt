You fear the excusion
And you pray for salvation
How low you can go?
And what does your god allow?
Absorb the absurd
No reason to cry
But a reason to die
So come with me
And we will ride
Among those whose nations collide

Take my hand and we will buy the tickets...
Take my hand and we will go through the decades...

To heavenly hell
What? He might be the way
He might be the truth
But I am the deadend
And I am the one who proves
His life, His work and His lies!
You can be the alpha
You can be the omega
but I am everything between
You are beginning and the end
But I am beginning at the end

[Chorus:]
We fly
In our own light
We ride
And stay outside
We smile even if we abide
I shall guide you there
Where our Nations Collide

Want to hear what He really is?
Just a grim reflection of your own stupidity
I want to hear His words... 
"I am Nothing
Resurrection is Initiation itself"

...And we are the way to the most highest.
