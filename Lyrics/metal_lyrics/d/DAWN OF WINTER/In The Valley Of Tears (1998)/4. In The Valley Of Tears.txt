You tell me you are leaving
Because you don't love me no more
Hell is real I'm not dreaming
So tempting to walk through death's door
How I wish I could hate her
Dear master fate you know I love her still
To me true love is forever
I miss her so much and I always will

Forever gone those happy years
Forsaken again back in the valley
Back in the valley of tears
In the valley of tears

Left me broken and bleeding
Someone tell me what could be worst than this
To lose the one you are needing
My life torn apart with a last fatal kiss

Save me, free me from this pain
Save me, bring me back to life again

I am forlorn in my fears
Led by your hand back to the valley
Back to the valley of tears
In the valley of tears

There's no comfort, no healing
Your words they have shattered all my dreams of you
Crippled emotions dead feelings
Awaiting beyond this sad valley of doom

Save me, free me from this pain
Save me, bring me back to life again

Darling come end my fears
Come take my hand
Show me the way, lead me out of this valley of tears
Darling come share my years
Kiss me with love now
Don't let me die here
Die in the valley of tears
In the valley of tears
