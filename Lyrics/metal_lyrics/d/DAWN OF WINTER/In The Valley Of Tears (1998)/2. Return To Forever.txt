Tread the Fields of sunset evergreen
Enchanting forecourt of my Grave
I witness death great mystery unseen
At last now I am saved
So come ye gather for my Journey
Let me become your Memory
Scatter my ashes I will join the Wind
Become one with the Earth and Sea
Unleash my Soul my Spirit's free
Again I'm whole eternally
I return to forevermore
And the End is beginning once more
Doomed forevermore
And the End is beginning once more
