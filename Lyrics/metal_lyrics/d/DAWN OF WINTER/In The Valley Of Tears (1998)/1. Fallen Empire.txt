Sirens scream the final warning
Law and Order fell
Chaos reigns the mass destruction
We face a fate of Hell
Too late to pray my friend
We are heading for the End
Eternal our Termination
The Earth's Salvation
Last chapter for a race of Fools
Now gone the World we knew
Black death descends to rule in Fire
Now fallen is our Empire
One final blow mankind extinguished
Silent are their cries
Last requiem for hate and violence
Nevermore to rise
The Earth redeemed renewal dawning
Long gone is the plague
As peace returns the universe
Is fire and calm again
