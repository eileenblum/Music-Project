I'm watching helpless my life turning to hell
I'm falling endless into the pain of loss again
Your lies were promises I read in tears from crystal eyes
Your tender warm caress now is freezing me inside
I'm bleeding and confused can I forget can I forgive
I'm feeling sad and used why am I doomed to live
I've closed this book too late so hard to change my fate I fall with broken wings
My soul for one true kiss too weak for pain like this slow is the suffering
Oh goddess spare me yeah this disillusioned tears
Desperate abandonment guiding me through all these years
All hope is gone for now forever there is no light beyond the black
Cold dreamless sleep is beckoning and this oblivion is death
