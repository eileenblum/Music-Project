This life has left its scars and wounds
Each day one more step to my doom
I have no hope left
All my dreams
Fallen apart at the seams

Take me down
From the hateful living to the dead
I join the peaceful dead
I go
To leave this hell behind
I'll never know
Life's dread
When I join the peaceful dead

Imprisoned
Lost within myself
I'm burning in my private hell
All I wish for is
Oh spare me
Another life in misery

Rest in peace
