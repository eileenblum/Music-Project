Fires of inquisition rage and burn
Manic blind fanatics never learn

Don't you see the flames rise to the sky
Rising high to let your damned souls fry
They won't change their minds
They never will
Now prepare to burn
In for the kill

For your sins
Your blasphemies
You'll pay
It's your doom
Your final judgement day

Soon you'll feel the fire lick your flesh
Scream in terror
Pray for a fast death
Curse their lives and curse their evil minds
Paradise
Salvation they won't find

Burn them all
Burn another sinner

Burn
Burn
Burn

Blindfolded
Castrated by their faith
Forcing upon us their holy ways
