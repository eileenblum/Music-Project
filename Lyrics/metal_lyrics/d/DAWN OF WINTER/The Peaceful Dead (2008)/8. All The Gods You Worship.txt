I don't know who I am
What do I live for
No living soul can answer me
I don't know why I'm here
I sure know nothing
Isn't this life insanity
Yeah

This earth it must be hell
A torture neverending
A downward spiral endlessly
Lost souls full of fear
Haunted by angels
Demons
Mortals fooled eternally

Have I fallen from grace forever
Is there no hope for me
I have failed
Am I lost
Is there no absolution
Madness reigns
And all the gods you worship are insane

You don't know who you are
What do you live for
No living soul can answer thee
You don't know why you're here
You sure know nothing
Isn't this life insanity

I guess we're all insane
