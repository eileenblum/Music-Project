So cold this night
Her shroud my grave
Onward I march
On paths unpaved

A solemn sojourner
Bereaved
Alone
Unguided on my way
In solitude I roam
No help
No home
Until my dying day

I am a traveller on life's dark road
A lovelorn traveller in search of hope

No piece of mind
No one to care
This burden's mine
My cross to bear
