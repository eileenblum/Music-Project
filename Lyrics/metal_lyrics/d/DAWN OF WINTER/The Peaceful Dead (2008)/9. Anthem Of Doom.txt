Depression pulls me down once more
I know that this time it's for real
Won't beg for help
No final words
A shadow I have become

I curse my life
I've tried to break free from the pain
I hate my fate
Don't let me live

My song of suffering
I give to you
My song of suffering
Anthem of doom
Give me a reason
To carry on
Give me a reason
Or hand me a gun

I enter the void
Through the gates of suicide
The plague in my flesh
Cancer of doom that you've called life
