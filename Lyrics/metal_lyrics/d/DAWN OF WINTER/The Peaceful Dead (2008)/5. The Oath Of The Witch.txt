Crosses burn my flesh
I fear no damnation
Deep within my soul
I cry for black salvation
Torture in my veins
Pain
Humiliation
Spirits in my brain
Bent on dark destruction

Witch
Bitch
Break free from the chains of his control
Save yourself
Save your immortal soul

I shall not confess

The oath of the witch

Crosses burn my flesh
There is no repentance
Onwards into death
Hell my final sentence
