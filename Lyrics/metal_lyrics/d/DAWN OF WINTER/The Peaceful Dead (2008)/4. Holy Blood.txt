Did he die on the cross
Was it all just a hoax
In their faith built on lies
What's the true lore of Christ

Holy blood
Holy grail
Did he win or did he fail
Tell me
Are his children still around
Will the truth ever be found

Did he marry Magdalene
If he did
What does it mean
Who wrote the bible
For what use
What's left to gain
What's left to lose

What do they know
What they won't tell
Women
Are they born of hell

Some blame the cross
The Vatican
Find hope 'neath the pentagram
My friend

Take my hand
