My love's long dead
All tears I've shed
I don't know why
Don't understand

Love's long gone by
Just pain inside
Don't understand
Please tell me why

I'm going mad
So weak and torn
A mourner sad
In mourning of the death of love

It's real
Love's dead
I see just black
I don't know why
Don't understand
