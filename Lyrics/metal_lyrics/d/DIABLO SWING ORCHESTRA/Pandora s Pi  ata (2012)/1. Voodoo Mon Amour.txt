Insert your needles elsewhere
I'm broken as it is
Cannot stand, or take the fall
Consider it as a bliss
Bewildered by your ego
Such a savage since you smiled
When I can see your pins in me
Iron gifts come pouring down

It's voodoo, mon amour!

Soaked in your breath now
We reek as mammals do
Reality emerges,
And presents itself upon you
Like a petty piggy laughter
So empty and estranged
(Of each other, from one and another)
And iron gifts just keep pouring down
