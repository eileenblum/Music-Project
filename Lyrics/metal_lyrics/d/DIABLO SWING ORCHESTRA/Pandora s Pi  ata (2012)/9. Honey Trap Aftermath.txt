Was it me, was it you,
Was it everything that
Never came true?
Hush my child
Now won't you need them?
I'll make them mine
In spite of how you treat them
Grace and fear, but the vision
Never ever came clear
Watch me try
It's time that you see them
They'll break with time
What if you need them?

Way down, won't you
Lead us on our way
Down from here

I will seek and reveal,
What if nothing that we knew
Was for real? I did my time
Love them and leave them?
But it became my life
And now you try to heal them?
Steal my time, and the honour
Was all but mine
Changed since then
How come I don't believe it?
Have faith again
Never had a reason

Way downâ¦
