Clean yourself of dust from a broken world
Set free to adore
Your love tastes like mine
empty inside but with nothing to hide

Your throat cries what used to be my name
Before the guilt drove you insane
Give in, give up

'cause in the end you'll follow me
I'll reveal the truth and all of my needs
Without the skin, the bones I'm god
almighty kneel then fear my love

You'll be tamed

Lust in spite of what I tend to see
If I dye those eyes I'll dye them
black like mine, like earthbound wings yearning for sky

Your body cries what used to be my name
Before the guilt drove you insane
Give in, give up

'cause...

Without the skin, the bones I'm god
almighty kneel then fear my love
My liquid love implodes your world
your shelter came undone so long ago
