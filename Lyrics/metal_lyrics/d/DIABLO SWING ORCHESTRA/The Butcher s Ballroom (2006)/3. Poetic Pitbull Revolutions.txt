Red Eyes Only, The Floor Comes Closer, A Kiss That Bruises, A Skin So Frail
Iron Taste Tongue, Rage Polluted, The Veins So Furious
With A Mouth That Will Never Tell.
Scars And Stitches Battered Heart Broke Down And This Time It Will Not Heal
Rear-View Lovers, Miss Them Dearly, Years Of Absence Has Made Them Pale.
Breathe And Soothe A Wake Mind That Cannot Sleep
So Much Hope And Now A Future That Looks So Bleak
But What If Time Is All We Have
To Make You Believe In
To Save Me From Leaving It All.
Dream Of Them Lights So Much Brighter, Voices Louder I Hear Them Sleep
Naive Prayers, Lone And Futile, Pulse's Rising, It's Boiling Underneath
Didn't Know I Hat It In Me, Didn't Know I Had It All
Fuel Them Thoughts May They
Keep You Safe From A World
That Won't Wear You Again
They Tell You It's Lonesome When Led Astray
