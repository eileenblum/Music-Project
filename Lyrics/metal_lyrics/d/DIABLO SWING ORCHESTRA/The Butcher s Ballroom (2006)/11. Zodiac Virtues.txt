You Try To Wake Up From Your Daze
It's Not Your Turn Though I Feel It's Getting Closer
Fall Back In Line And Please Retreat For Another Hour, For Another Week
Turn Inside To Reach Out, Sense You Close Yet You're Out Of My Sight
Now Open Up And In One Last Try Won't You Give Me Something To Remember You By
I'll Feed You Lies Like The Truth Shall Set Us Free
Try To See Not To Believe The Shaded Truth Of You
Please Don't Follow Me Into The Sun
Hope Things Might Turn, I'm All But Clear
My Mind At Ease In Spite Of What I Hear
I'm Hiding In Shades Where Peace Is To Be Found
The Faceless Just Waiting For You To Succumb
Those We Don't Speak Of Now, Those Who Dress In Sweeping White
Now Embrace The Future You'll Be The First To Meet
And Then You'll Better Wait There For Me
I'll Feed You Lies Like The Truth Shall Set Us Free
Try To See Not To Believe The Shaded Truth Of You
Please Don't Follow Me Into The Sun
