So I Assume This Could Be Freedom From Me To You
And With Such A Distorted View Upon Life And What We Do
Your Ways To Persuade Me Into What My Memory Is Forced To Shade
I Loathe What You Made Of Me Bullet Blind Eventually
All Those Aching Hours With Abusive Powers
Whispered Your Name Through  It All, Now We're Stuck With That's Left To Save
But Out Of All I Entitled You My Favourite Scar
I'll Keep It Forever Closed, Keep It Forever Sealed, Keep It Forever Closed
So What If I Wake Up To The Sound Of Another Illusion Break
Smashed Now It's Yours To Keep Close To Whatever You Call Your Needs
Now When I've Seen You Fall I Can Finally Start To Recall
Sights Of A Past Unclear And Learn What I Should Hold Dear
All Those Aching Hours With Abusive Powers
Whispered Your Name Through  It All, Now We're Stuck With That's Left To Save
But Out Of All I Entitled You My Favourite Scar
I'll Keep It Forever Closed, Keep It Forever Sealed, Keep It Forever Closed So That No One Will Know
