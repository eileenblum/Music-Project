Tuck It In Or Take It Out For What
You Cannot See With Them Eyes
A Tired Hand, Her Naked Hand, Putting Me To Sleep.
It Won't Be Long, Your Glow
Has Left Me Dry And My Abstinence Has Been
Postponed By My Comfort In Denial.
And The Worst Lie It May Be That Hope Said
She'd Be The Last One To Leave.
Always Close Now Sense It Clear
For Years To Come I Can't Go Back
To The Things I Held So...I Held So Dear.
We Were Crushed By Her Halo Oh What A Way To Go...
Endlessly She Said Forevermore In Debt
Colourful, So Beautiful, With Fever Eyes Closed And So Free
Those Were My Heroines.
Freedom Roar From Senseless Mind
Apocalypse All Dressed In White
Saw It Coming Watched Them Leaving With All I Ever Was.
Broken Tissue, Broken Dreams Far-Fetched As Those Fantasies
Since Peace Of Mind Was Not Meant For Me.
I'll Praise Them Silently...We Were...Endlessly.
