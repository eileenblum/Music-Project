Well-paid Jesus, vicious nails
by tired angels of mine
Fresh taste of first light when they do come down
Skin-deep memories of siren lullabies

Sealed from us from me
From everything
You go
Despair you tend to bring
to me, to us
to everything
With tide comes

Holy water, she's breaking those waves
Holy water, she's breathing those waves
The silence keeps her sane

Tainted sounds from haunted throats
Iron tears on satin sheets
Silver spoon, bred through pain
And Then Silent All Those Years
Ether Eyes Have Never Seen
Where dirty hands have never been

Sealed from us...

Holy water...
