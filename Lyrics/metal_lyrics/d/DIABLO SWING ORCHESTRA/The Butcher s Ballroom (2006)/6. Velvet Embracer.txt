In the mirror
Angel face
with angel hair
in an angel cage
In the mirror, violence staged
tremble without her embrace
In the mirror
Velvet wires
Dressed her shivers in desire
Precious silence for the masses
Blind them all hope to ashes

Make way breathe with ease
Display her thoughts on peace

The truth in your eyes
Never should have been so lonely
A fragile move within
Breathing in time
with the ones who never owned you
Requiem, invite them all

In the mirror
cracks in their truth
today she's done
today she's gone
Gently veiled in violent slumber
Eyes forgave, since outnumbered

Save her innocence
Long gone is her scent

The truth...

Cura, Mortuus, Sanctus, Veritas
