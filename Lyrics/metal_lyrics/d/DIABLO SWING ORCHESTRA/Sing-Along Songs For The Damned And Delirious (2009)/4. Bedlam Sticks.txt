In a place where long lost souls are led astray
A penny is a cheap price to pay
We play those poke'em in the nostril games all day
Oh the fun! Oh the joy! They all would say
Ode to tranquil meant to soothe
Head riots, all them bells in my mind in high pursuit
In love with a spine, I try to stroke it most of the time
I wish they could, I wish they would

Leave us alone, leave us alone

Carnivore, never could tell, no one seems to feed you
Carnivore, tell me what is that smell, no one wants to greet you
Life on clouds and walls in bloom, bring the cookie, eat the cookie
Who's the cookie, I'm the cookie
Sing along and my birds will hum, bring the cookie, kill the cookie
Who's the cookie, I'm the cookie

The warden plays such a pretty little tune
We call it the toenail dance and we're in love with the fumes
A sweet and innocent after tea romance
Painting blisters on our feet, more sugar by any chance?
We sway in time to the rhythm we left behind
Are we entertained by the lunacy at hand?
What we see is man's cruelty
We're down on our knees begging you please
