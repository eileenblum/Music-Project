With mind games you find ways to dazzle us all
With true lies and sore eyes you question our call
You speak with a new voice to those never heard
Enticed by your preaching, soon they will serve

Clean your wounds while they're open
Undress those scars you hide and I'm sensing you're broken
Can't leave you be, my escape from reality

Time now has tainted the peace we once had
Drenched in delusions and burned by your hand
Have faith in a new world, insane as before
Seduced by your wishes, now we want more
