I see them days are coming
We hear them roar
They'll bring the end upon us
And we will have no mercy no more
Then you'll search for your soul salvation
Our hands are bound
We cry out for direction
But only those truly lost can be found

[Chorus:]
Why won't you
Save them, oh let me save you
Heal them, I can heal you
Make them closer to your heart?
We can't just watch these walls come tumbling down
Why won't you save them, oh let me save you
Heal them, I can heal you
Make them closer to your heart?
We can't just watch these walls come tumbling down

In the final hour, you can cleanse your souls
By whispering "Hallelujah"
Now raise your hands, give praise to him
By singing "Hallelujah"

Saved from the cold, 'cause I can do without you getting praise where I go
There's a truth to be told, and I don't want them to go

[Chorus]

Saved from the cold, 'cause I can do without you getting praise where I go
There's a truth to be told
But I don't want you to go
Pale from the fall, if that's your excuse then you'll never be called
There's a truth to be told
I just don't want it to show

[Chorus]
