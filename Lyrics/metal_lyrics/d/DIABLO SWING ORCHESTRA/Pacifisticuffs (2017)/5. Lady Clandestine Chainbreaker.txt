They tell you how to be a man
They tell you how to be a woman in a dress
The colour of your skin gives them the power to
Determine who you are

But in our minds
And in our dreams
I know that we can feel

Emotionally

Free
Tasting it feels so good
Free
Wanna have it and eat it too

They say
Who are you gonna be?
What are you gonna do?
But I know there's another possibility
Some of us can't
Some of us don't
It can be hard to breathe

In our minds
And in our dreams
I know that we can feel

Emotionally

Free
Tasting it feels so good
Free
Wanna have it and eat it too
How about you?

On a mission
Taken for granted
Knowing that things will change
This secret I have seen
The illusion of life
Can't contain us

How about you?
Well
If you can't choose
You try to stand tall

'Cause in our minds
And in our dreams
I know that we can feel
Emotionally free

'Cause in our minds
And in our dreams
I know that we can feel

Emotionally

Free
Tasting it feels so good
Free
Wanna have it and eat it too
Free
Taste it, it feels so good
