Take him, take him very far
'Cause I can never leave him
Can't hold on to what's never gonna heal
Make him safer, break his fall
Catch him while he's vulnerable

Loving him was not just a coincidence
I tell you, he was broken, I was broken too
Speak the truth in every sense
Bury it with innocence

Wade through your troubles with grace
Night and day
Can't combine
This life of heaven and hell
Leaving home
Have faith and follow the road
There's truth, believe in your soul
When it's time to let go

Take him, take him, take my heart
This love is all I've got
Oh I'm fearing for his life, but still
The choice was mine
Make him safer, break his fall
Catch him while he's vulnerable

Wade through your troubles with grace
Night and day
Can't combine
This life of heaven and hell
Leaving home
Have faith and follow the road
There's truth, believe in your soul
When it is time to let go
There's truth, believe in your soul
When it is time to let go
