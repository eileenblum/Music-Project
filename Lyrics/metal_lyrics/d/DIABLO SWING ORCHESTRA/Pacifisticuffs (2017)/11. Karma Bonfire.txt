Iron pipes - come let us dance!
Bang, bang, bang
Can you feel the romance?
Walk in line
Oh how our brown shirts shine
'Cause easy solutions we provide

Save them darling
Take 'em all so far away
So we can help them darling
Take two
We're never gonna leave you

Shake it and then break it
And then tear it down
Show you all
Where the scapegoats are
We'll fake it and just leave
The truth to be drowned
We won't look back
Shake it and then break it
And then tear it down
All dressed up just to let you down
Can't you see it's the jester we crown?
We will not look back

Karma bonfire baby
Make way - we'll burn them all!
Flames of reason
It's all for the greater good
It's all we've ever been - misunderstood

Save them darling
Take 'em all so far away
So we can help them darling
Take two
We're never gonna leave you

Shake it and then break it
And then tear it down
Show you all
Where the scapegoats are
We'll fake it and just leave
The truth to be drowned
We won't look back
Shake it and then break it
And then tear it down
All dressed up just to let you down
Can't you see it's the jester we crown?
We will not look back

No, no, no
We'll never ever look back

Shake it...
