Secret signs, I show them to my heart
That shares my view
Thought it's old and all too sore,
This heaven cannot hold it anymore

Two-faced eyes
There's nothing that can keep me
From my prize
Glory days, though come and gone,
And you'll be left to mourn
What you have found

Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun
'Cause I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe for you

Speak your mind, 'cause my dear you don't
Even know how to life
Charlatans all gathered now
They're here to watch us
Crumble from inside
Out of time, and end oh so fitting
Can you hear the crowd?
For the very last time,
Just show them how you swayed
When you were mine

Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun
'Cause I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe for you

Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun

I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe

Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun
'Cause I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe

Dream of you
