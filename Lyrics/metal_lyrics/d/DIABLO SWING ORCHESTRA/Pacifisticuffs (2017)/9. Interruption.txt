Fingers playing
Melodies I dreamed of before
Feeling deeper
Come closer, time is patient

Interruption makes the flow
Interruption makes me feel
Interruption in life is what makes it real

Oh
Feel the energy rush inside of me
Oh
Flows in every part, so deeply in my heart
Oh
Feel the energy
And dance against the stream

Going faster
Dancing like music can swing
Feeling higher
Stars Shimmer
Closer explosions

Interruption in something sweet
Interruption is the heat
Interruption in life is what makes it beat

Oh
Feel the energy rush inside of me
Oh
Flows in every part, so deeply in my heart
Oh
Feel the energy
And dance against the stream
And sway with me tonight

Come spin me around...
