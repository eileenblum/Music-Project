As a child
Soft and wild
Imagine what life could be like
Safe and sound
Lost and found
Here, not yet twisted in mind

Like a feather
Like a whisper
Like a promise shouldn't wither
Away with the last rays of hope
In a longing for belonging
To something more
A million light voices
Now washed up ashore

Searching through the sky
Seek for love that never dies
Dreams and hopes will burn alive
Hide what's there
Not meant to share
So most of the time
I forgave and forgot

Like a feather...

But I can't find the trust tonight
I can't sleep with this world outside

Like a feather...
