War has desecrated this ground
And now impurity reigns
Marshes of blood and mud
Remains from the fallen ones
They, who were once brilliant and pure
Are now meat for the ghouls
No plant can grow here
And fog smells like pure evil

Dead lights walk crying in despair
Eyes that can't see but their own death
Images coming back from hell
Creatures of darkness

Wearing the skin of the dead ones
They devour the fallen corpses
And use their rusty swords
As hammers to break the bones

Kingdoms fall and new wars come
Warriors die and their bodies decay
Feeding the creatures of the place
Where rottenness dwells

Time pass, ineffable
Everything perishes, unstoppably
Nothing remains in the place
Where rottenness dwells
