I looked to the sky, and there was nothing
No glory, nor lover, no wonder nor power
I looked to the sky, and saw the sun shining
I looked to the sky and I wondered
Is there where I came from

Energy and fire brought us to life
And by the same fire we shall die...

Elements reject and repulse, attract and fluctuate
Its substance remains forever
Oh, it's such a big word for me...

I've looked to the sky and I've seen where's my place

It's in the middle of infinity
Far from everything, close to everything
