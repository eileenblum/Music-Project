Cross the sky, oh, great backbone
Show me the path
Future and beginning
Be my guide in the world

Sailing through your luminous waters
I'll finally reach the end of all things
Break the walls of time
Receive all knowledge

Light in the darkness
A fire that destroys all ignorance
Pillars of strength
Columns of true knowledge
Pillars of strength
The true knowledge

The night of God will end
And a new sun will rise high
But the backbone will be always there
Showing us our beginning
Far away in the stellar dust
And showing us our true end
