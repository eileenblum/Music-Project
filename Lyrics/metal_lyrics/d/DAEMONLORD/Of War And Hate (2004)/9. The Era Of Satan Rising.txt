[originally by Thou Art Lord]

Our bodies obscured by the sun
from our birth we are cursed
inverted is the life we live
under the pale gray sky.

Bellow the shades of the dark clouds
victory is drown in our eyes
a dawn of a new order we adore
the infernal prince we worship.

The balance of life and death
the icy tough of existence
spit out the fruits of madness
expose your hate, escape from weakness.

Open your eyes and see
the veil has been lifted
The chain has been broken
OUR REIGN HAS JUST BUGUN!!
