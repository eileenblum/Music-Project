Driven by darkness and sorrow
Possessed by the five winged star
Despair and grimness guide my hand
No more paths left to walk

Driven by darkness and sorrow
Alcohol is my only support
I drink till the very last drop
Oh, there are no more tears in my eyes

I break the bottle
I take the knife
I lick the blood
Falling from my hands
I lick the blood
Falling from my hands

I loathe, hate and destroy
This fucking empty world
I've denied life
I've entered a coil of self-destruction

Driven by darkness and sorrow
I sacrifice myself to the only lord
The lord of eternal nothingness
Who will raise my corpse with his hands

Madness...

The lord of eternal nothingness
Who will raise my corpse with his hands
