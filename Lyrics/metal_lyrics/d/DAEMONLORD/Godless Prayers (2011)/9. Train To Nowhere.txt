I was told it would take me to neverland
Everything would be perfect, a divine life
The fastest train on earth. railway missile
It would be worth the effort, the sacrifice

I left all my belongings next to my past
Why should I need them now, when life's so fast
I didn't have regrets, I looked forward
Awaiting for the sunrise, the promised land

I caught the train to nowhere
Scheduled at all times
I caught the train to nowhere
But I traveled at night

But dreams are so frail
So easily changed
And life is too short to spend it with haste
