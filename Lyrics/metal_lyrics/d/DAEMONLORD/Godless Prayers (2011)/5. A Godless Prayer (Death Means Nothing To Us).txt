Give me the tool to get rid of every empty question
And I'll be the god that faces blankness
Give me the quill to fight against all human fears
And I'll compose a silent requiem

Death means nothing to us

Empowered by the lack of chains
With a dear mind and restless hearts
When laughing with the joys of life
When lying at the verge of death
We defy non-existence

We are free from the fear of God!!!
We are free from the fear of War!!!
We are free from the fear of Death!!!

Death means nothing to us

Give me the hammer and the plough to shake the earth
And I'll compose a silent requiem
