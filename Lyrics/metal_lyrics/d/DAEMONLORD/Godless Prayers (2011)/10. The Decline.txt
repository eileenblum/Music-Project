Your foul deeds, won't remain unpunished
Do not think, time will heal what you hurt

The dark seeds are revolving against you
Without fear 'cause there's nothing else to loose

The bigger you are... the harder you... fall !!!

Don't speak now of recessions, you are the same old dirty hag
So full of lies, trying so hard to catch the mice
You must think time makes crimes, water under the bridge
History shows it's not like that, people will fight
Don't tell your intellectuals, to write tales of despair
