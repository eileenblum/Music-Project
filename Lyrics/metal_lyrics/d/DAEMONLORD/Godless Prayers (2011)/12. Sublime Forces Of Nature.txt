The soil is trembling; mountains throw up high a rain of fire
Old gorges crumble down and swallow entire rivers,
A huge glacier collapses, water floods the unbothered valleys
The wheel of change is led by no hand dire

Impassively the high cliff waits to be removed of its regal cape
When mountains rise then time decides that others must also lose their crown

The desert waits to be reborn when rains again feed its forgotten sands
The proudest sea gets dry and dies, its bottom becomes a green prairie land

As nature proceeds we behold without speech, frozen by sight
And try to make sense of it all
Becoming aware that we live... under its command,
We name it our goddess with fear
