Layers and layers of ice
Keeping the dust from the past
Frozen accounts of the unknown
Wells with the water to quench the thirsty minds

Rulers to the land of ice
Frozen bacteria and dust
Rulers to the land of ice
Entombed in frost

The frozen vaults of time
The keys to know the past
Another form of life
A mysterious reply

Deep, underneath
The memoirs of the earth
