It's raining embers on my head
It feels like I'm alone
The sense of time has gone all wrong, and now?

Bombs, gas, shrapnel and fire
With limitless barbed wire
An image of hell on earth,
That would shake the bravest heart

A thousand idiots - attack
A thousand idiots die

Bombs, gas, shrapnel and fire
With limitless barbed wire
Yet these waterlogged trenches
Are but a scratch on the earth

The sky is crossed by flocks of partridges
How come they're not afraid?

We, humans, die ...
Mountains remain ...
