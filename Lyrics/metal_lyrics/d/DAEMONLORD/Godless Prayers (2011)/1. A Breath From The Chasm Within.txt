Sometimes I feel a sort of agony
And makes me walk stiff
But it's my face that wants to look upright
Avoid monotony, confront a higher goal.

A breath from the chasm within!

Struggling to break the cuffs
I noticed that blood could be
Much better than oil to make
This slavery endurable
But anger won't give me breath
And sorrow won't give me strength

It's obvious I cannot find
The answer outside of me
I must search for it inside
I must search for it within!!!

Riots of flesh and blood, a stream that fuels the brain
The stronger revolution is that which starts inside

1he engine of life exhales!
The engine of life rebels!!!
