Morning, another day,
I stand up, I must try again.
Resiliently,
A stone that cannot change.

But trying was the first mistake
Now I'm battered and forlorn
Obsessed with dreaming I forgot
And let it grow strong

Morning, another day,
I stand up, I must try again.

What's this hard rock we make big dreams with?
Why pursuing goals we know reach no end?
