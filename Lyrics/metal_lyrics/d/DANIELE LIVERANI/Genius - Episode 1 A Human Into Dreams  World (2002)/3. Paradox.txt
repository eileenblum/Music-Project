[Well, you probably didn't imagine that when humans start to dream, the adventures, the great fantasies, that they experienced are caused and controlled by their assigned twin spirit. This Twin Spirit is a sort of guide created to handle the dremaers minds, making them live what they dream as if it was true. But, under normal circumstances they shouldn't see him and they shouldn't even know about his existence. When created, to be admitted, the twin spirits knock at the gates of the Dreams kingdom with a particular beat sequence that works as a password. Causally, the Genius clock alarm beated exactly the same sequence, and, being a drummer himself, he started to imagine in his mind a snare drum pattern that followed that beat. He was not completely awaken and the snare beats he was imaging of reached the dream kingdom gate, and he was wrongly admittend in that parallel dimension by the doorkeepers considered as a regular Twin Spirit ! ]

[Storyteller]
The two brand new friends found themselves in a very long and funny coloured train where the twin spirits grouped in pairs, were sitting. The train started unexpectedly its race and immediately reached an incredible speed !Infatc, after some minutes, the train eventually reached its final destination. The Twin Spirit Land. The Stationmaster was an old man that since the birth of time has always greeted the new twin spirits at their arrival to the land]
