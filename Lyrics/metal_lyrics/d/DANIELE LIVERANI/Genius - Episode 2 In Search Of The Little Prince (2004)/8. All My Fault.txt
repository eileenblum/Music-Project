[Genius]
I'm Sure You Know Where I Am
And I'm Sure You Can Read My Mind
So I Hope You'll Understand That I've Really...
I've Really Done All My Best

I've Lost All My Energy
I Know This Place Will Be My Grave
Dear Friend Believe Me If You Can
I've Really Done My Best To Explain Them !

[Twin Spirit N. 32]
My Friend I See Where You Are
'Cause I'm Leading Your Dream And I Know
I Shouldn't Have Let You Go In There
'Cause I Knew He Would Not Believe

I've Lost All My Energy
And I Wish I'd Never Been Created
I Should Have Killed Myself
When I Understood That
My Existence Was Born In Vain !

[Genius] I Thought This Strange Event Was
A Game Easy To Play
[Genius &amp; Twin Spirit N. 32] I Have Lost All My Chances

And Now There Is No Way To Show Them That I...

I Was Totally Caught
By The Sound Of My Bell's Ring
Yeah ! It Was All My Fault !

I Was Totally Caught By
That Incredible Sound
Something Strange Was Still Going On !
It Was All My Fault !

The Haze Kills The Dream
Now I Believe...
There's No More Chances !

All of Genius' attempts had been useless and he now began to think that this was the trgic end of his adventure into the forbidden world. when hope seemed to be fading away into the hills of nothingness, a shadow appeared at the entrance of his cell. It seemed to be in the shape of a beautiful woman...
