[Twin Spirit N. 32]
I'm So Sad !
There's No Point In Living Anymore
My Nature Has Been Twisted By
Your Presence In This Unreal World

And I Wish I Never Existed
I'm So Tired !
How Long Will This Hard Challenge Last
I Wish You Had Reminded

[Twin Spirit N. 32 &amp; Main Choir]
Where The Human Live
Far Away From  Here !
Where The World Is Real
Far Away From Here !

[Twin Spirit N. 32]
Here We Are !
Still Fighting For Him, Here We Are !
Still Trying To Believe That There Are
More Chances To Save Our Prince
But In My Heart
I Feel That The End Is Not Too Far
I Wonder If This Could Have Been Avoided
I Wish You Had Reminded

[Twin Spirit N. 32 &amp; Main Choir]
Where The Human Live
Far Away From  Here !
Where The World Is Real

[Twin Spirit N. 32]
I Feel The End Is Not Too Far...
I Feel The End Is Not Too Far...
I Feel The End Is Not Too Far...
I Feel The End Is Not Too Far...
I Feel The End Is Not Too Far...
I Feel The End Is Not Too Far...
I Wish You Had Reminded

[Twin Spirit N. 32 &amp; Main Choir]

[Stooryteller]
The two friends finally found the old oak. It was only a three dimensional image that concealed the secret entrance to the Asian stores. They passed through the old oak image and cross the threshold into a wide underground space filled with infinite warehouses. They knew that the european prince was being kept in an Asian toy's warehouse but... which of all these stores was the right one ? Time wasted away; there was little of it left and they had to find the prince as soon as possible ! Will Genius and Twin Spirit N. 32 fail to find the toy's warehouse where the prince will be used as a fantasy for a dream creation and then destroyed ? Or, will they find him beforehand, just in the nick of time ? To be continued !
