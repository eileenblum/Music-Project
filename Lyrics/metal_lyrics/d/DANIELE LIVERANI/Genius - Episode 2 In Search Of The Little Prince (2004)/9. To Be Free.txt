I'm So Sorry
About That Ungrateful Man
He Didn't Believe You, But I Did
Blinded By Glory
He Was Not Able To Understand
Innocence Shining Through Your Eyes
And I Know That I Am Right
'Cause This Time I Will Help
Someone To Be Free

There Is A Backdoor
That No One Knows About
I Escape Through It Every Night
And I Will Take You There
And Then You Will Be Free Again
I Know That I Will Risk My Life
But I Know That I Am Right
'Cause This Time I Will Help
Someone To Be Free

Lookin Within Your Desperate Eyes
I Can See My Fears
We Are The Victims
Of The Same Oppressive Mind
I Want To Follow You
And Run Away From This Prison
I Must Respect My Identity
But I'm So Glad For The First Time

He Won't Be The Winner !
He Won't Be The Winner !
Because This Time
[Klepsydra &amp; Main Choir] I Will Help Someone To Be Free !

[Klepsydra]
Beyond The Valley
You'll Find An Ancient Oak
That Is The Entrance To The Stores
Now Go On And Save The Prince
[Klepsydra &amp; Main Choir] So That You Can Also Help Someone
[Klepsydra] To Be Free, To Be Free , To Be Free
