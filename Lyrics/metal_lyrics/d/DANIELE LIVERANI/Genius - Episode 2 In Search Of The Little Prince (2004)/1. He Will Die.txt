Time was running out. The Dream League Force Troops, led by their powerful commander, have already entered the twin spirit land and, in a few minutes, may be able to locate and terminate Twin Spirit N. 32. If this occurs, then Genius' dreaming would cease immediately and he would not remember any of it. If that occurs, then King Mc Chaos' innocence would not be proven and his little son would not be saved. The European Dreams Kingdom is about to loose their beloved royal family forever ! Without delay, Genius and Twin Spirit N. 32 have to find a way to escape from that place to avoid being captured...But How ?

[The two friends were very lucky and the teleport device worked ! That teleport had always been used by the twin spirits to transport the infinte objects and fantasies contained in the European Kingdom stores to their consoles in order to create the dreams for their assigned sleeping humans. No one has ever tried to use the teleport in the opposite direction and get to the stores. But, it worked and, casually, they were sent to the European "Japanes Fantasies" store]

[Storyteller]
The two teleported themselves away from the European twin spirit land; they made it just in time to avoid being caught by the Dream League Force. There were many weird japanese objects that randomly disappeared, even though a twin spirit requested and teleported them away in order to create dreams. While the two were walking around, nearly lost in the endless area, their ears started to pick up a nice guitar melody comeing from somewhere. That music was not unknown to Genius...
