[Storyteller]
There was a long distance to cover, but with a ship as fast as the speed of light, they reached their destination. They hid in the cases until they were discharged into what was probably a temporary storage. When the chance came upon them, the quickly escaped out of the cases. Then, they started running casually in order not to be discovered. After running into obscurity for quite some time, the two friends arrived at another place. Here, there were no twinspirit or humans, of course. This valley was immense and full of trees sculpted in the shape of odd numbers ! This was the Odd's Valley. Suddenly, one of those strange trees began to talk to them in a comical tone. He seemed to be worried about their presence in that valley...
