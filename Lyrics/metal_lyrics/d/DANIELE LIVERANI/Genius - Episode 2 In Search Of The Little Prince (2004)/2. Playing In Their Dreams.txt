[Genius figured out that the music was played by the fantasy image of the great guitarist Jason Becker, one of his most admired guitar players ! Being extremely popular in Japan and dedicated to eastern sounds, a se tof infinite versions of him was made available at the European "Japan Fantasies" store, ready to be used for the fans that were dreaming of him ! Genius and Twin Spirit N. 32 were delighted and enlightened by the fantsstic melody that Jason was playing and for a while, they forgot about their troubles. The information from Jason was  very insightful and luckily, there was a possible aim to reach for. Among all of the Dream Kingdom there was an intense exhange of objects and fantasies performed by many ships that were exchanging objects and fantasies of different cultures everyday...]

[Storyteller]
Jason led them to a place where the ships were leaving for the Asian Kingdom. After a sincere thanking, they slipped into two cases filled with strange looking objects and proceeded very carefully, hoping not to be noticed. Five minutes later, they were carried into an enormous ship and eventually left for the Asian Kingdom. The prince was waiting to be destroyed as a toy fantasy in one of the Asian stores due to the sentence of Maindream for his father's crime. There as no time to waste, Christmas was getting nearer and during that time many children dream about dolls ! Meanwhile, the Dream League commander was still searching for Twin Spirit N. 32 and he couldn't explain why he was not at his console in the European Twin Spirit land ! He was extremely upset and asked his troops to be wiser and search farther.
