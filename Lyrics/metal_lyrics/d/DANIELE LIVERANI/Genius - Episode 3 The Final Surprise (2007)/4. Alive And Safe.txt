[Mr Niko] Here we are again dear sirs together under the same word
we'll protect the human dreams using all of our forces!
Dreams are a way for them to be free
a chance to meet their own desires
places where happiness can be real
our aim has always been clear!
Their dreams will be

[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Their dreams will be
[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Yeah! They will!

[Mr Niko] Dreams allow them to explore the meaning of their inner world
that's what they all really need to take a look inside their souls!
That's why humans should never be allowed to interact with dreams
they would lose part of their being
our aim has always been clear!
Their dreams will be

[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Their dreams will be
[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Sure! They will!
[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Yeah!
Their dreams will be alive and safe!

[Mr Niko] Someone's taken a risk to compromise dreams
but I'm sure! My dear sirs
no! This won't happen again! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
The power of our fantasies will shine in their minds! Trust me!
They will have a real chance to fly
[European Senators choir] A real chance!
[Mr Niko] Their dreams will be

[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Yeah! Their dreams will be
[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Yeah! They will!

[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Their dreams will be
[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
[Mr Niko] Sure! They will!

[Mr Niko &amp; European Senators choir] Alive and safe!
Alive and safe!
Alive and safe!

Alive and...

[Storyteller] Genius' dream was coming to an end, and a train slowly approaching towards him was the proof of that feeling. It was full of twinspirits. All the twinspirits looked sad because they were going back to the place of their creation to be terminated at the end of the dreams they had been conducting. They knew their end was near. Twinspirit 32 stared at Genius, but his smile was shaded by a veil of sorrow. It was clear to both that they were going to part forever. The train stopped and the two joined the row of twinspirits who were at the start of their last voyage.Twinspirit 32 had to find a plan to get the prince back to his Kingdom as soon as possible.
