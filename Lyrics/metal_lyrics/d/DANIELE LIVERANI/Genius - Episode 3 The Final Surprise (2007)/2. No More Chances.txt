[Apikor] Before the human awakes he'll be terminated for sure!
Uh! Could someone tell me why is he still alive?
Why have you failed to reach your goal?
You are the best troops in the entire league
tell me how has twinspirit survived your raid?

[Dream League Force choir] He disappeared
[Apikor] Tell me why!
[Dream League Force choir] We just can't explain!
[Apikor] Why?

[Apikor] I won't allow another failure!
It's time to step his running
there will be no more chances!

[Dream League Force choir] Before he will awake he'll be terminated for sure!
[Apikor] There will be no more...
no more chances!

[Apikor] I heard news from the King of the Asian reign
the human had been captured there!
For some reason that he did not explain
someone helped the human to escape from jail!

[Dream League Force choir] He must be there!
[Apikor] He must still be there!
[Dream League Force choir] He still must be there!

[Apikor] I have prepared a secret plan!
This time we must be sure
there will be no more chances!

[Dream League Force choir] Before he will awake he'll be terminated!

[Apikor] It's time to end this game now!
Now!
I will explain my secret plan!
So listen to my words
there will be no more...

[Dream League Force choir] No more chances!
[Apikor] No more chances!
[Dream League Force choir] No more chances!
[Apikor] No more!
[Dream League Force choir] No more chances!
No more chances!
No!
[Apikor &amp; Dream League Force choir] There will be no more chances!
[Dream League Force choir] There will be no more chances!

[Apikor] There will be no more...
no more chances!

[Storyteller] The search for the little prince was going on in the Asian toys warehouse. While the two friends were trying to find out where he could have been hidden in that big warehouse, a tiny voice coming out from somewhere among all those toys was trying to catch their attention.
