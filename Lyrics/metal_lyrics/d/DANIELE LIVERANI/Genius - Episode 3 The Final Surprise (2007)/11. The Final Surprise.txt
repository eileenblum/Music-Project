[Main choir:]
Going back to reality
Genius is going back to reality
Oh! Yeah!
It's time for you for going back to reality

[Genius:]
I've arrived at the end of this crazy journey
I will leave forever this place
I wish I had enough time to say goodbye to my guide
To thank him for so much that I've learned

[Twinspirit n.32:] Here I am!
[Genius:] Oh my God! It's you!
[Twinspirit n.32:] I'm proud you did it!
[Genius:] I thought you were dead!
[Twinspirit n.32:] I couldn't die without saying goodbye to you my dear friend!
[Genius:]
Oh! My body is fading!
I'm slowly disappearing!
I'm understanding that...
[Genius &amp; Twinspirit n.32 &amp; Main choir:] I am losing you!
[Genius:] Good bye!
[Twinspirit n.32:]
Good bye! Here's your dream
Do you know what this means?
[Genius &amp; Twinspirit n.32 &amp; Main choir:] This means I will always remember you!

[Storyteller:]
In reality, only ten minutes had passed from the beginning of his dream until the alarm clock, placed near Genius' bed, started to ring loudly once again.

Hearing that sound, Genius realized that he was almost fully awake. It also meant that he was leaving the dream's world forever. You should know that Twinspirit 32 deceived Apikor by simulating his termination during their fight. He actually copied his existence process into a near parallel dimension and kept it running for enough time to pass the whole memory of the dream to Genius and after that he terminated himself. This was obviously an infringement to twinspirit' rules and a possible danger for the dreams' world secrets to be revealed to humans, but he trusted Genius' responsibility and let him remember his special dream, as a tribute for his success on his mission. Also, he could not resist the chance to say goodbye to him one last time. In fact, with a great surprise, once he came back to reality, he remembered everything of his amazing dream!

So Genius had the chance of carrying in his heart the memory of his friend and of his crazy journey into dreams' world for the rest of his life. Even if he remembered the secret sequence to be admitted into the European Dreams Kingdom, he would never go back there and never tell anyone about it, staying faithful to his friend.

The loyalty and the great sense of responsibility he learned from him in that alternative reality world would be in his heart for the rest of his life, but now that you allknow all about this secret dreams' world, will you be as loyal and as responsible as Genius? Let's hope so...

Goodnight!
