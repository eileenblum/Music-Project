[Kokeshi doll] Hey! You! I'm here!

Buried under these dolls

I am so close to you!
Can't you see? I'm right here!

trying to avoid being used like all those dolls
time goes on and I've no choice
I won't escape my fate
soon I will be destroyed!

[Genius] I hear a voice coming out of this shelf and look there!
There's a small doll that's calling us
she's right there!
She seems so real!
[Twinspirit n. 32] Maybe she could help us
[Genius &amp; Twinspirit n. 32] To find what we're searching for!

[Kokeshi doll] Oh! I see...
But tell me please!
Why should his life be saved?
And why should I die like this?

He has been closed in that small secret room
you'll need a secret number to unlock it's door

[Storyteller] They picked up the baby with extreme care and walked out of the warehouse in order to get back to the underground's entrance.
