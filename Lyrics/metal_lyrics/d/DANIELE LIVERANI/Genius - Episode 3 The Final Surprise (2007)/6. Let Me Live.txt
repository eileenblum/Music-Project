[Apikor] Now that you're in front of me tell me how could you do that?
Tell me why you've helped that human?
Use these moments that you've left as a chance for you to explain
did you help that human escape?

He will not get him back!

[Apikor] What you are saying is so crazy and insane!
No! I won't wait! You will be terminated

You know, you should have put yourself
in the hands of Dream League Force
why did you escape from their raid?
