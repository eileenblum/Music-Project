[Storyteller:]
Genius was beginning to see through an intense haze. He was close to awakening and he was happy for having achieved his goal. European Kingdom Senators convinced themselves to take a look at the memory support. Finally they convinced them self that King McChaos was not guilty. Unaware of this success, Twinspirit 32 was trying to resist Apikor as long as possible to give Genius more time to complete his mission but Apikor was very determined and hit him forcefully.
While he was laying on the ground, having almost lost consciousness, he felt that his end was near.
