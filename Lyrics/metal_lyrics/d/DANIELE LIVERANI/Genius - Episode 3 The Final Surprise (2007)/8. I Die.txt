[Twinspirt 32:]
Here is the end driving me close to eternity
I hope you had enough time for what you had to do

I am so sorry
I feel so sad

I tried to survive and fight for you
But slowly my mind fades away
Joining all the rest
I should have died without pain
But now I know I won't

I am so sorry
I feel so sad

Raising my hands to the sky
Here I die
Here I die

I thought to be without a heart
Without a human soul
But since we met
I have learned
That I was something more
I had to hurt you
I wish to say!
I'm sorry...
But my time is going to end...
My friend...
Here I die!

If only I'd survived for some more time
If only I had the chance to say goodbye, my dear friend
Here I die...
Here I die..
Here I die..
