[Senator Jeramus:]
Dear twinspirits
I have good news coming from the Kingdom's jail
I am sure that you'll be happy to hear what I'm going to say
The European prince has been saved in time!
He will not be destroyed
Soon he'll go back to his dad

[Apikor:]
The human that had entered our world has been sent here by his twinspirit
With a copy of his memories
Demonstrating the King's innocence
Soon McChaos King will be unjailed
He will be coming back
Soon he will have his reign back
Oh! Yeah!

[Senator Jeramus:]
Our own world has been in danger but the justice has triumphed!
I'm so happy to have found out King McChaos has no faults!
Finally our reign is safe again!
We don't have to be afraid
[Apikor:] 'Cause everything is going to be solved
[Senator Jeramus:] The pride of our land will go on!
[Apikor:] We will continue to work for a...

[Apikor:]
I thought the human could have learned how to come back here once awaken
Now I'm sure he won't remember 'cause his twinspirit has been terminated!
The European land is safe again
We're no longer exposed to risk!
[Senator Jeramus:] 'Cause everything is going to be solved!
