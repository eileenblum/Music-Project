Follow me, into obscurity...
I'll lead you to a domain of painful existence
One where the tortured spirits deplore

Cries from beyond ar heard
At one with fire, our lord
Welcome to the afterlife

Too late to cry for compassion now
Have chosen non-repentance
Blistering winds consume your flesh

Ghouls all to see, unholy beaconing
Searing tides, deplete your soul
