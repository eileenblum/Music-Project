Buried inside my brain lies many complications
I am exploring a world of illusion
Mind deteriorates
Inscriptions of malfeasance inbetted
Throughout
Growing apparition commands
Casting depravement upon creation
Obliteration rendered
The phantom again returns through the image I commence fortification
Vivid hallucinations sojourn
Subconscious plagued. Epoch recedes
Momentary lapse of reason. Quest for tranquility
Subliminal mutation. Dwindle away. Vanish
