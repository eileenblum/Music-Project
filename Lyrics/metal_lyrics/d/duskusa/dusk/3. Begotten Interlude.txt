The grace of thy lands elaborate regression
Our sacred momento, a failed trail
An indication of feeble intellect

Seize the day
Pitiful dismay
Impending decay

A vision: He's come

The petals of ecstasy, intense delight
Dismissed
This foresight is now real
Anticipate with great fear the second advent

Seize the day
Truth divine
He's come

Biblical prophecy, embalmed reality
