Walking through my kingdom of desolation
I look ahead to a vast emptiness

Under me, the earth lies decayed
The specter summons me
Deep inside the gates of sorrow
Sadness shall follow

Burning hate now grows within
I question my meaning, my reason

Messenger for the dark
Christianic prelude
Converted to impiety

I acknowledge myself as a god
A Lord of false reality
Continual link to another dimension
Gates unclosed - confused motion

Agony, my infite companion... Eternal
