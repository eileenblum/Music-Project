[Freitas] 

I've tried to find a meaning
For each day you close the door
I was just misleading you with every word I said
Even when lights are turned off
And the path seems so long
There's a candle shining in my lonely heart

I will find my home
This place will be filled
Where do I belong?
Where do I come from?
