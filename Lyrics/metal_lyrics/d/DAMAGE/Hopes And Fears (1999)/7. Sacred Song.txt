[Nogueira]

I wake up every night
With this emptiness inside
Was I just born or am I dead?
Bloodstains on my tattered clothes
Each minute the fear grows
I'm tired of searching for myself

Like a sacred song
Like the dream you know
One day will come to life all by itself
Like a sacred song
Decades gone by and I know
Look to the stars and blow it all away

The whisper is but a shout
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Feel the blood pump through your veins
Now I really can feel the truth
What am I supposed to do?
I can do everything I want again

This is so unreal, what I feel
Take a step away and look around
This is so unreal
Will leave you writhing on the floor... crying
