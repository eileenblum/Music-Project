[Freitas] 

We crossed the land in search of sea
We just found pain and misery
No one knows how we would like it to be

Awake again, I see the one who stands
He starts to rise and then fall again
No one can save us when this dream ends

How many years we've got to pay
For the mistake that we had made

Watching the dawn of eternity
Terrified by the memories
From those days of madness
That hinder us from being free

Dreams seem near when he walks alone
But they will come to carry his soul
Leaving his conscience and now they must know

Run, don't look behind
'Cos time is moving on and lifting lies
When things are falling
Who will you blame?
We still stand, until the end
