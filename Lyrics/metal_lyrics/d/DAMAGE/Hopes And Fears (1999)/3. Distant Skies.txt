[Freitas]

I was staring at myself 
Frightened and wealemed bu the visions
That make my life seem so unreal
Somber clouds cover the sky
Hiding secrets lost in your eyes
But they keep confusing
- "Reallity or eternity?"

How could I be so ruthless
Drowned in a lake of senselessness
Sunddenly what I believe fades away

Strange ideias fill my head
Nothing you do can bring me back
Now that my draft is gone
Empty years, glory years

Sometimes I feel it escapes from my hands
Sometimes I want to climb higher
And throw myself away

Where all those hidden signs
That will lead me to distant skies
My life isn't what it was before
I'm living in a world that I want to ignore
