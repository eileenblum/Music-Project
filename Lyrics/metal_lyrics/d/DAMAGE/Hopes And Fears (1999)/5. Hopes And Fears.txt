[Schirmer] 

Forsake your own will
Feel the blow of drift
You'll set your soul for a long first trip
Don't care what you think
'Cause you won't believe
You will try out what your eyes can't see

Take a deep last breath,
And then throw yourself
You will flow like blood flows in your veins
You're a hunter, not a weeping prey
Prepare your fangs now
There's no time to pray

Where will I be tomorrow?
When will I find the truth?
Who steals from me a peace of life and my soul

Live tonight
And leave your past behind
Don't turn your hopes into fears

Don't fear your death watching you from the left
She will warn you when she touches your face
It's your destiny, not a fantasy
And it follows you from the cradle to your grave
