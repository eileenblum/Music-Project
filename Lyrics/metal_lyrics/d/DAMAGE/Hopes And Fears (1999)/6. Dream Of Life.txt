[Freitas]

I see my face reflected on the mirror
It seems afraid to look at life
But look around and see what's holding me
I have to fight to keep my pride

Watching time writing down my fate
And taking words as a piece of me
I just can't hide behind the memories
Closing my eyes for what I believe

Sometimes things seem to take another way
And it escapes from our own hands
Every night when words surpass my fears
The dream of life isn't so far away

I wake at night when it shows me destruction
Sometimes this world seems so unreal
I see a different face inside the mirror
And than I realize these wounds will heal someday

If I'm not here, I've been here
The signs on the wall tell me what I've learned
Believing, forgiving
Living behind all the wrong I've done
