[Freitas]

Far Away
All my life I've been far away
Living thoughts and words that will never fray
I was living althought I should change mu fate
I'm cold, but inside I know I'm the same

And the dreams that we had 
Will be lost along the way

I'm tied, but I'm still looking for my dreams
It seems hard, but nothing else wears my will
Life gos on and before it shades comes
If it's worth it I'll just know when I get to the end

'Cos the dreams that we had
Will be lost along the way
And the reason to stand is the will to begin

What we left behind
Always seen a waste of time
To your twisted mind
Living in the past
You just hear and hide the facts
We are turning back
