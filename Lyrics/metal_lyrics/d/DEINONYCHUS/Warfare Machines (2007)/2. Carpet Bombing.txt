[Music and Lyrics by Marco Kehren / Deinonychus]

Flares lead my way over the occupied lands,at the dawn of opening my hatch.
From a high altitude everything below seems asleep, illuminating our objectives.
Sparkles below create a carpet of surprising pain, unlike a common daily rain.
Return emptied and exhausted on spare fuel, another city in ruins victory is ours.
Hear the whistle from the sky.
Bombs are falling, you're going to die.
Breathing your last breath, the end...
A once vivid city, scorched and burned.
In formation upholding our vision we returned, re-fueled and reloading again.
Causing pain and extinction, below there's nothing to see, just fire and tears.
We carpeting your fear and lives, erasing your memories, thunder from above.
The sound of our engines have silenced from the screams below as we go onwards.
