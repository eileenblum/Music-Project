[music and lyrics written by Marco Kehren / Deinonychus]

Warfare machines.
Killing spree.
Witness the mad.
Hatred infested.
Tomorrow in flames.
Morphium eyes.
Witness the mad.
Hanging west...

Now there is
my fairytale
of dying flowers
of the earth
and those it covers
of dying maids
and viking men
of birds.. that never
of ever are the same again.
