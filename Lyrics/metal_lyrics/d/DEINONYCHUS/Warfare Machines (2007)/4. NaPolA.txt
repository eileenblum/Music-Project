[music and lyrics by Marco Kehren / Deinonychus]

We grow by number, every day one joins under the swastika.
Leaving behind the civilized world.
Every thought serves the cause, as we've been told many times.
A proud to be Aryan.
Curtains of blood fall over Europe, we are the next in line.
Preserve and protect from decline.
To kill is to survive...
I'll take away your life...
Follow the runes, we are dressed in hate.
Your Zionist God will come too late!
Each of us, indoctrinated and stale.
My knife pierces your flesh, so pale!
