Raping the light before my eyes
No sense of awareness
Everything dies
From dawn to the end of all times
Dreams faded to dust
From above,
All seems so cold
There is nothing
Stop screaming
No one listens

I've seen this coming
The craving to take is god-like
Bitter flavor
Red
Crowning this moment forever
Crowning this moment forever

Please let me go I want to live
There is no need... no need for this

Stories are about to be told
Mine ends here for no reason
You're eyes are wide open
The screams statued alike... alike

For this, I live
This is the reason
This is the reason
This is the reason
For this I silence you
