Witness to an atrocity
I have sewn stench of death and decomposing
Was to eat a 1000 sins
I am the eater of sin
Devourer
Black birds pick at my flesh
Cleaning meat from bone
You laying in arms of naked flesh and needles

And maggots like you still are here to receive the forgiveness of your sorry lord
What is more evil:
The edge that is filled with heroin or blood or?
It is the sons and daughters of a generation dying
When your time has come

Why just to fly and fall
How will she feel tomorrow
When her only daughter
Was fucked gutted and taped in silence
Her eyes fixated on yours
In her last moments, she watched you
Watching in haze of drugged fueled orgy

Your hollow and dazed eyes
You walked your baby into the act that had to follow
Be sure my child of light, you are forgiven
Mother?
I am taking you into darkness
Forever
