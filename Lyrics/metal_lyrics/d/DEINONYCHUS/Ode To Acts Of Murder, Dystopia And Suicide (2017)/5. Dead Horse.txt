Where there once was a love and a beautiful dream
On my knees, bleeding, crippled and high on morphine
Motherfucking amphetamine is taking me away from me
Slave to tears, the grief and your never-ending melancholy
I am singing a tune of the devil, but really there was an angel
Inside I was hiding by getting high all the fucking time
I was a poem to death
The funeral hearse was a horse drawn cart, and the horses are dying
And Satan sat at side mocking me and whispered:
"Your time is up"
"You belong to me my fucking demon"
And he said unto me
And I fell

There was a horrible realization I was and am all alone
It was loathsome to be blinded
Lost and all but forgotten
Fucking you was no satisfaction the mind was only open to escaping
It was putrefaction
You sacrificed and for fornication
You a perceived crown
Made pure by deceit
Legs opened, smell of lust and decomposing lovers
Your wish to be with another
...has fucked me... has fucked me
