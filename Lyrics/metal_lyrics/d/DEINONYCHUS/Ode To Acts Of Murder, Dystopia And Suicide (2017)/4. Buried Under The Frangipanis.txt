Buried under the frangipanis
Your child is hidden
His beautiful smile was taken into wickedness
My taste for the vile and pain
Has devoured his innocence
Breathtaking the sunset on his last day of suffering
Bleeding into the sunrise
For him, there is no tomorrow
How hollow his mother's sobs and pitied sorrows
Heightened was my pleasure
Enlightened I have become

[?]

With his stillness
I grew even colder

In a hundred lashes I watched him bleed
Bended over my knee, he did plea
He called for you, mother
Then darkness knows my heart
I cut him apart, butchered into a thousand pieces
And on my plate, I ate his innocent soul
My desire was sate

(Mother, his future desired of a wife and loving family)

His dreams, I fucking shattered
In my sickness for lust, flesh and blood
My little adventure is all for me to keep... silence
All of your tears won't bring back your sunshine
...back from the grave
God now has him all to himself
