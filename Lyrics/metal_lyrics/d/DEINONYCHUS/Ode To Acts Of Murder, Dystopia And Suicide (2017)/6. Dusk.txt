Earth weeps as tears
Red from the sky
Falling upon unhallowed ground
The suffering went silence
As no screams are to be heard
Many prayers left to be unanswered
We have been forsaken
Stabbed and strangled remembering only sheer terror and pain
Where is that savior
The one shining so bright
Releasing us from this endless agony
All around is the eye of ignorance and denial looking the other way

No anniversaries for you are forgotten
There is no place to say your prayers
Deep below you are buried
Never to be free

(As we mourn into eternity we dwell
You with your eyes closed
We will come and get you
For you are damned)
