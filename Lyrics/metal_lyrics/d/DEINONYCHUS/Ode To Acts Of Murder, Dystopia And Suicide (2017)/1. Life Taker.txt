I laid with pigs and drank their swill
Should have been the killer not to be killed
Had me on my knees and fingers dug deep
Knife against my throat
Slowly drawn back
You watched me die
Walked me to the altar of sacrifice
Promised me forever after
It was all just a lie
...just a lie

When your vagina should have dripped with honey
It was just a chalice filled with my own blood and semen
You were witness to the fall look at the monster I have become
Fucking was an act of stigmatization
Two languid souls of desperation naked flesh
Two haters entwined
Eyes blind and hands bind
Zero three one five
Look at the monster I have become
I am not the punisher
I am the punished and undone
Lover of violence
This dance we dreamed
The shit I have had to eat
Just me another lover
Crawl up into you to be with those pigs
If that was all you wanted
Then why restrain
Why chain and detain
You could have let me taken my last breath
The noose tied
Here comes the little death

Enjoy this
These are my last words
I am that monster I have become
This is my hate for you in tongue
The serpent won't forget you
Life taker he can smell you... dripping
Your wet with being the faithless
Whilst I kill myself
But I survive
You cannot have my future

Whore

Taker of my life
