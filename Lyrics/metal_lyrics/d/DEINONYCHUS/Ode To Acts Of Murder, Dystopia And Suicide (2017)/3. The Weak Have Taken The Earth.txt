Falling down
No one there to catch you
The voices in my head I hear
Stay to oppress

[?]

Now I come into your life
Swallow me deep inside
Silence the old
I'm feeding your pain
Instead of going away
I took blood lust with me
You were given to me
You were my last resort

I weaken your body and infest your mind
I was told to heal
You can't change what I am
The evil in your head forever to enslave
Many died by my hand

You made me do this
You made me do this!

Now I come into your life
Swallow me deep inside
Silence the old
I'm feeding your pain
Instead of going away
I took blood lust with me

A vicious circle
Trapped inside my head
My heart is bleeding my soul scourged
The sound, ear deafening
As I fall onto the ground
Finally I leave

Death take my hand
