The mere moment of suffering and pain means nothing to me
I was born taken my heart by sadistic intent
Amongst many, I am the invincible and silent
You won't see a star shining and weeping to you
The wolf in my eyes is sleeping and feeding on hatred
A smile like being a peaceful faÃ§ade
No matter what I am the erupting volcano speeding your death
Bury my sin in God's hands for I am innocent

I will stop your sunrise and nightfall
God told me so, this is what I feel
Waking up, this world is still the same
My hunger silenced for a moment

Seeded in my infant dreams
The serpent wide awake
Empathy, my alienated brother fallen from grace
The voice speaking my mind, leading my will
In Hades you'll mourn no star to be seen
Torture your mind and sodomizing your flesh
Over and over again
A cycle never ending to the end of days
The serpent forever to stay
There is no Eden
Collecting your screams and cherish the still image in your eyes

I will stop your sunrise and nightfall
God told me so, this is what I feel
Waking up, this world is still the same
My hunger silenced for a moment

Taken your life
Buried deep
Cemented with blood
I wake up day after day with your memories now to be mine... mine
God looks the other way
Nobody seems to care... seems to care
For I am the end
I am the end

For I am the end
I am the end
