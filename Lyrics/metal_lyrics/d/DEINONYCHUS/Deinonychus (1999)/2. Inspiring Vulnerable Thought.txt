[Music and lyrics by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]

Inspired by your curves, I reached for my scalpel. Searching for any light to 
expose your silhouette. Your tears could never cease your fear towards me. Be it 
as it is, I'll just perforate your flesh. In my museum I've never been so 
enthralled like this before. Absent-minded that I am, it made me do all this. 
The bloodstains born to be a fantastic memorabilia. Life explodes in my face, 
but you wouldn't hear. Your picture leaves my imagination, another solitary day 
welcomes me. In the company of dawn I'll be in therapy. Send me a postcard! This 
is destiny.
