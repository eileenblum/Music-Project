[Music and lyics by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]

Walking over the seeds of tomorrow. No babies to be born today. The king's crown 
shattered has left. Snow White is nothing but a cheap whore. Wake me! I stepped 
into this picturesque landscape held by a frame. On the way back it told me to 
leave my soul in the snow. My screams didn't help. Why are angels entitled to be 
saviours? Today I'm married to misery, and we live long and happy! Wake me!
