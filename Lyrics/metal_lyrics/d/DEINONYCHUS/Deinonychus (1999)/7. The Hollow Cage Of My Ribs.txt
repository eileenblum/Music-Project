[Music and lyrics by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]

The trees in the park are smiling at me. They try to tell me how wonderful life 
can be. As innocent as the blue in the child's eye; the sun wakes all life 
beyond. The purity of the blade wrote history inside of me. However, never 
capable to resurrect me. All roots of life have abandoned me. The candle inside 
of me, has blown out. My room becomes darker and darker! Never will I understand 
why fish can't walk. Perhaps it's because I coudn't become part of MY life. The 
trees in the park are smiling at me, they try to tell me how wonderful life can 
be. As innocent as the blue in a child's eye; the sun wakes all life beyond. 
However, I'll never understand why this happened to me. But as it is with every 
storyâ¦ There's always an end.
