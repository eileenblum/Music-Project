[Music written by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS Lyrics by Shane davison]

My words fell with such silence, as I watched the blood slowely weep from open 
wounds. A still rose bled into a sunset, while the red dragon waited to consume 
the midnight sky. A dead snake nailed to the wall, coiled and started to feast 
upon himself. I'm paranoid! Insects were really angels in guise, and my lover; 
she was a whore. I cry an ocean deep azure blue. One more injection to try to 
forget you. Siddhartha, sits staring into the reflection in my eyes. As a sullen 
funeral procession gathers. To dance around my dead heart. Like Lucifer; i fell 
into the night. Venus star so bright in the mourns light. A laid faith in a 
whores well. So warm was the caress, how could i resist; to take of one kiss. 
Black devil; under your white sun of darkness i was lost. But now it's time to 
ride the red dragon one more time!
