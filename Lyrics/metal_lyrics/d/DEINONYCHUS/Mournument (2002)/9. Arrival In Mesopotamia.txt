[Music and lyrics by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]

Your visit came to me as a pleasant surprise.
What is it that you want from me?
I have died and been buried!
Your offer... being an endowment;
walking hand in hand.
Does this mean I'll rise again from this bone-collected earth?
I'll give you back what once was mine, you'll give me back what once was yours.
We shall see again, bleed again, walk again; regain the pain.
Let us go now, I'm so lonely up here...
My eyes are burned by the sun.
I start over where my life begun.
The world turns, there is night and day.
In Babylon we've been taught to pray.
I enjoy the falling rain, but who's carrying my burden of pain?
I want to go back in the earth again.
Close the window, and let the sun go home.
But now there's you: Nemesis.
Now I'm sitting here, indicting this all down.
Naked I am... for all those years.
My soma turned to dust; my bones, useless at all.
I'll rest in the arms of Morpheus.
