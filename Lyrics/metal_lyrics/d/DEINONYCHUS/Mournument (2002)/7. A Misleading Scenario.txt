[Music and Lyrics by Marco Kehren/DEINONYCHUS]

"Hello", I said to my last life.
Buried my flesh;
withered and captured in the earth's vault.
The fragrance of my perfume doesn't matter anymore;
life is no more, it's useless this all.
Now, I'm Israfiel.
Walk through me...
The rain are my tears, soaking the earth...
Hollow are my eyes.
Judas said; " A heart never dies"...
Why I don't bleed inside anymore, is it really true that am I no more?
Pain vessels me to my seat, and you said;" I would die for you".
I have spoken all your words as you taught me, and I believed them all!
Now, all you did was say:" I would die for you".
