Staring the blind, they are surrounded by a view without electricity
Can't see the readings of God, not believing the world is telling them
Slashed their veins, they cannot tell what colour their blood is pouring from
I agree upon thee, that life without a view is a rape of light and vision

Their eyes had been taken, by surprise, with cruelty, and sadism
Incursion followed, with horrid pain, my hands couldn't stop,
I had to claim Carmine my flesh, I've taken their light,
I am the sadist, you're the walking night
Couldn't see my face, wondered why,
I behold all power, no one is innocent

Retribution for what I never could see...
Scattered they walk to bury their eyes...

Speaking voices spinning in my head claiming the views upon I fed
Those pictures collected from the innocent enfeebling my will to live
Deep down my journey facing the last of images passing by
The sadist betrayed me, all this cruelty to read here was just a lie...

Raped, my sanity
Life, taken from me
