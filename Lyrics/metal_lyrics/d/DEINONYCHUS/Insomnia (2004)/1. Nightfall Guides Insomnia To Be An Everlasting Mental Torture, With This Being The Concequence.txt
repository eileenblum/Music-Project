Carried away by the kiss of the night, heaven pitch black, the moon my only guide
My eyes gazing holes, mirror a timeless labyrinth, downstairs I go for a while
The most abominate memories arise, piercing through the night, no invitation applied
Mentally cursed this journey, paralyzed eyelids, pushed the pause-button of life
Riding the beast for such a long time, surreal madness, no sleep will ever arrive
Scarlet visions of my open pulse, liquid draining away, is this a dream to be told?
Chaotic and picturesque, voices strangled to death, without any emotion expressed
Where to find the beauty of sleep, is it for sale somebody say, killing my conciousness

Insomnia is my name
Raping your peace
Piercing you
Mindless
I give you timeless thoughts
Cold and sweated limbs
Exhausted you'll awake
Memories painting torture
Walk like the dead

Hell on earth killing time, murder peace of mind, by daylight condemned to be blind
Returning every night, countless and deformed, the horror roaring inside
Jumping from the edge, no more nights appear, quietly and yet peaceful
Weakened and dead flesh, remains of utter punishment, peace at last.
