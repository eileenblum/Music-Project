Curtains fell from the night, divulging blasphemy, orifice wound
Amassing from the flames, raining from the blue, ashes remain
Immersed by intense heat, melting tissue burns, pale is my skin
Injected fuel penetrating my veins, boiling my brains, satisfactory diagnose

Dissever me, entomb me
Killing me, entomb me
Grass is growing here, smiling upon me, blackened soil remains
Glass pieces mirror, horrifying silhouettes, walls weeping silently
Ice stiffened my limbs, constrained emotions, isolating fear
Dismantling the core, swept away with ire, another sin ends Frankly seen
I don't care, no witness to tell, collecting a thousand memories
Paranoia takes me
