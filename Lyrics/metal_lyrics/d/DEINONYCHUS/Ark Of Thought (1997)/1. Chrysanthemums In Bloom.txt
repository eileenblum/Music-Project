[Music by Marco Kehren/Deinonychus Lyrics by Shane Davison]

A faint taste of my blood hangs heavy in the
air
And of Chrysanthemums in bloom
In honour of the long dead souls at rest
The shadows cast an eerie light upon the stone

Heavy is my heart from the loss
Weeping I lay down upon the ground
The cool night air sets the mood so distant
Hours and hours I pray, do my cries fall upon
deaf ears
Dawn is so far, I cannot hold on

Staid am I, I fell nothing, nothing
How long can I hold onto this dream of ours
Long suffered in melancholy
Forever is a mere second in dead tongue
For the light has dimmed and hours passed

My dress is torn from my constant madness
This life is too cruel and unbearable
Why wait to be spirited to death
I kiss at your feet to stay with me
I hear the beating of my own heart

Can you feel my love for you
I've long tired of the lies
And thrust me into the arms of dead lovers
The throes of ecstasy will not last
So as the grave fades, so does life eternal

Dawn is creeping into the night's sullen
incandescence
Time has come to say our last goodbye
And do not weep for me, I shall not weep for
you
Then how is your face stained with tears
For the night has passed

If you must leave me now, tell me your heart
The truth will haunt us
And I no longer wish to remember the hurt
Then kiss me goodbye and be on your way
And free from your guilt, never...
