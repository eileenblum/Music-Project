[Music by Marco Kehren/Deinonychus Lyrics by Marco Kehren and Alex Kurtagic]

There, where I returned, a time of unrelenting
horror...
Magicians clouded wisdom, revering names in
solemn books.
A gust from an obscured epoch, when fear caged
the hearts of men;
With a dagger in my hand, menace soaks the
moment.

Dreamt glimpses of encrypted memories:
A journey far from here;
Am I you, who knows of my damned soil?

Later on they found me, all life drained, my
eyes wide open.

Flowers on the tomb remind of life eternal;
Devolved to me, the wisdom of recondit
centuries...
Dreaming of pure damnation...I remember...
