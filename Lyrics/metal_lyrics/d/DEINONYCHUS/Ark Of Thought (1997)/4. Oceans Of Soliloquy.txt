[Music by Marco Kehren/Deinonychus Lyrics by Shane Davison]

Like thousands of ripples in the ocean,
thousands and thousands of ripples
Or a ight full with burning stars, burning
bright with the fires of the sky
I see an unhappiness in your eyes, always in
the eyes lies the truth
The loneliness in your voice, on the verge of
tears,
Even across vast amounts of time, even without
the use of time
I know you all too well
And I know that without you, I'm in my own
self-made hell

If I threw a single coin into these oceans,
one single coin
Would it take forever for the wves to reach
you, and drown you in their volume,
Tears descend everytime I look out unto the
night, and lay waste on my tongue
And to think somewhere you are looking out
unto this same night, with another by your
side
No matter how many times I cut into myself,
deeper and deeper I cut
No amounts of blood can stop my hurt
So I just look back out at the night

Even the pleasure of orgasmic rush, the
screams of absolute pleasure
Can no longer bury the dulled pain in my
heart, and wash away the grief
This tired and weary heart, burned away by the
pain,
I just want to rush out into your arms, but
the embrace would deem so cold now
But dont have the strength, this mass ocean
keeps us far apart,
And again, I must pull myself out of
melancholy.

Many, many times I see your face, as if
spinning in a dream
Deep in though of your hateful love, blind was
I to it
But when I try to grasp you, you fade away,
just like a dream
And your laughter echoes in my mind, they're
all laughing
And across these oceans, I can still hear you
laughing
And I fall to my knees to cover my ears from
the laughing

Just like a thousand ripples in the ocean,
thousands and thousands of ripples
And a night sky satiated with burning stars,
burning bright with the fires of the sky
I see pools of unhappiness in your eyes,
allways in the eyes lies the truth
You can tell me no more lies, yet you keep
telling me lies
As they wont reach me anymore
They could never reach across these oceans of
soliloquy

So dont tell me that you don't love me
anymore, yet don't tell me
that you love me either...
