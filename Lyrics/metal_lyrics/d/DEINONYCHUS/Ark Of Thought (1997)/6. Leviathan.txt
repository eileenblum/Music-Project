[Music by Marco Kehren/Deinonychus Lyrics by Marco Kehren and Alex Kurtagic]

Hovering the incidence of humanity
I have been elected the foe of your virtues
As I claw at your soul, devouring my way
through
Your flesh amasses corruption's hoard.

What once enthralled has become different
during this time.
Is this all I was destined for, being a
useless whore?
The love I hunger for...Oh, I envy you of
this...
Listlessness ensues the wasteful bliss
Of this whimsical destruction
I hate you...Leviathan.

Please show me the way...
I am not much different from you
Forgive me my sins...
I will repay the pain I have given you.
But please show me the way...
