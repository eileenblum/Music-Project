Yes, you bade me follow
And I made that choice
By my own oath beholden
I pledged my blood honour
I'll come into your kingdom
And feel the dark passion

I have done as you did

These sleepless nights
Cold sweat on the palms
My hair danced with
The wind through the window
One step until!
We meet again

I have done as you did
