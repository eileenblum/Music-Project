Yes it's true, my life-story is one of a
failure
Yet nothing can bring me back what was taken
away
For my heart is still burning with her flame
I hope i can still join her, whatever the pain
Why not? I was the one who forced her from me
I murdered myself a hundred times, you can see
the lines
Oh, when i realised what i had done to her
I thought of every way to undo the crime
That we could make it how it used to be
No! Why?

You cannot imagine how desperate i feel
This all seems so dream-like and unreal
Time1 What is time to someone in grief
I can't even shed tears, just this blank
disbelief
Perhaps i cried once a century ago
Here i stand shadowed by the trees and the
midnight moon
Commiting this sad tale onto paper
And to tell you, please think of me!
Who created this pain I suffer inside?
Who condemned me!
To this immortality!!?

Reborn with no name
It can never be the same
No more peace for me
I give myself to eternity!
