It's raining outside!
Staining this black coat, but!
You wouldn't know!
A cold and Grey sky
Drowning all my tears but!
Your eyes are closed!

No! No!

Every minute seems like a lifetime
The past is slowly killing me!
Never will this leave my mind
I'm haunted by the memory!

No! No!

This is a bitter loss for me
