Sorrow is the path i'm doomed to wander, in
this hunger for blood!
A cold unlife I never desired, for the endless
nights drag on!
The night! the night

At first i would not believe this was for
real, so i cut myself but no blood fell
All recollection of past life gone, the taste
and smell of the daylight world
Fear, fear

Last view of daylight!
I haunt the night!
In a coffin i hide!

"Come to feed my uncontrolled desire, my
precious beauty
I'll grant you a gift you'll not see in this
life
A walk through the labyrinth of eternity
Close your eyes, you'll soon awake in
paradise"

Lies, lies!

One by one they died, all those who were my
brides!
Living in hell I call this, cursed with pain
and bitterness!

Can't look at the sun!
To darkness reborn!
For my life i mourn!
