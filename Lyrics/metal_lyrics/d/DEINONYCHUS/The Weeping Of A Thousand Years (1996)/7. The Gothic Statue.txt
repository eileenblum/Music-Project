Ancient and lifeless, like god's perfect idols
The statues looked down and unspeaking saw
The hypocrisy uttered within these four walls
Is this the palace of a just god at all?

For many were the wars we saw, many fought and
died
God's kingdom prospered upon those corpses
piled high
Giving sanctimony to slaughter, the churches
killed for christ
We saw that their religion was the hand that
held the knife

Now the altar is silent and claimed by the
dust
This building crumbles from disuse and
mistrust
The annals of infamy attest to the last great
truth
Religion is a whore (and we the fools)!
