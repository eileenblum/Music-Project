So empty inside, like a life that ends
A sun that goes down, never shines again
Heart ripped out, stone cold hole left
Sleeping forever, the only choice i have
No more dreams, all faith is lost forever
more...

The pain in my soulâ¦ seems so endless
Waiting for everlasting salvation
All is gone...

See the leaves come down, so begins the end
Look at the sky-shine with the wintermoon
Frost has set in, and all feels so cold
Depression inside reaches the highest
I am going to lay down and restâ¦ Darkness
