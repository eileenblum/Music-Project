Phantasmagoric hill of sadness
Beyond the toxic black clouds
A magnificent castle in flamboyant style
A monstrous mass of of ashlar and ice
With splendid gigantic aedicules
Framed with phallic columns and
Mysterious blind arcading, with
Misericordian decorated frescoes
A sanctuary for ceremonial unholyness
An invitation to the realm of darkness

I am alone in my dark castle
Standing in the dep catacombs
Searching for new inspiration amongst
This cryptic sanctuary of meditation
The gathering place of raddled bats
Watching through the rose-window, feeling
The presence of a menacing air, possessing
A voluptuous face, enters the black chamber
The tenebrous architectural rules of
decoration
It's in the end of ancient time of Saltire

Turning back to the perpendicular tabernacle
For celebration with an unblessed sacrament
The deep atmosphere is as ever, nightmarish
The dreams are beginning in the asembly of
Coven members, the essence of my own mind
The hatred, proceeding into the ambulatory
Solitude in castle of horrors
Solitude under the trefoils
A mysanthropic life in a mysanthropic silence
