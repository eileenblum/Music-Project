Breathing my last breath, as i lay stabbed on
the floor
The last ceremony of the priest will help me
no more
As they wrapped me in black, and put me into a
coffin
I knew for sureâ¦ I would return!

You fuckers, you're going to pay for what
you've done to me
Now i dwell thoughout the nightâ¦ a reason for
fear
The window stood open, as i slipped into your
body
That morning after, your soul dissapearedâ¦ You
were so cold

For candles burned all around, there was a
dinner for two
Someone else sat in my place, with my loved
one in front
As i looked into their deeply horrified and
stone-cold eyes
I knew for sureâ¦ They would die!

Yes oh yes, I touched their scared flesh,
their remorse couldn't
Help them no moreâ¦ their souls left with me
into the night
As the last tears were criedâ¦ as i became one
with the earth
I finally could restâ¦ 'til i returned on my
path through the night
My travels throught the midnight skyâ¦
