Snow has fallen in deep
After midnight you leave
Drunken of purple wine
Dark sounding district of men

Tears of pain
Crash my face
Trapped to die in this hell
Death release me

Lust of death
Hallowed before
A red wolf killing an angel
On holy ground

A white starbanner burns
Red flames of their fires
Your eyes follow the steps
Of fiery angels on ice
