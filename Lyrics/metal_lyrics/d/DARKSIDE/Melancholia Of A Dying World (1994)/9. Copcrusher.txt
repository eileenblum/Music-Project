read - your law - deceit - not reckoning your host
see - my fate - no rights - a call to accounts
make a mistake - my fault - no statement of claim
ruled - to obey - my duty - but I'll get my quits with you

crush - your illegal seizure of my personal things
erase - infringements instead of legal judicature
rage against an illegal justice with rightist tendencies
I demand - an unequivocal administration of public law

Blind your eyes - open me - deforming all perspectives
Hail - you gos - fuck you you assholes
Your court - your jail - the elegy of a forgotten sin
Destroy - concealed - clandestined - information on all in your head
