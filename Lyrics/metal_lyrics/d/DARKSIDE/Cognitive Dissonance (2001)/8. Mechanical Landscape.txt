AZAGTHOTHS SOUL DWELLS IN YOG-SOGGOTH
HE SHALL BECKON UPON THE OLD ONES

FOUL AND FORMLESS
AZATHOTH FOR THEIR MASTER
ABIDE WITH HIM IN THE BLACK CAVERN

WHEN THE STARS
MARK THE TIME OF THEIR COMING
FOR YOG - SOGGOTH IS THE GOD

FOUL AND FORMLESS
AZATHOTH FOR THEIR MASTER
ABIDE WITH HIM IN THE BLACK CAVERN

ALL CREATIONS BOW
BENEATH THEIR MIGHT
WHERE CHAOS REIGNS
AND FORM ABIDETH NOT

THROUGH WHICH
THOSE OF THE VOID WILL RE-ENTER
YOG-SHOGGOTH KNOWEST 
THE MEANING OF TIME

FOUL AND FORMLESS
AZATHOTH FOR THEIR MASTER
ABIDE WITH HIM IN THE BLACK CAVERN
ABIDE WITH HIM IN THE BLACK CAVERN
