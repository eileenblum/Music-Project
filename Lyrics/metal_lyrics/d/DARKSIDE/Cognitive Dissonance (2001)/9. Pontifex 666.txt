[Words: W. SÃ¼ssenbeck / Music: BÃ¶hm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]

THY WILL BE DONE
AS WE WALK INTO THE WAR
WHAT YOU COMMAND WE`RE DYING FOR
AS THEY ALL DROWN
YOUR WILL ARISE !
IS THE TRUTH JUST IDOLATRY

UH YOUR WILL BE DONE

AS THE AEONS GO BY
AGAIN TO RESTORE THE TRUE KING
TO THY THRONE
UH ALL ELECT ONES

WE HAVE NO NAMES
NOR IN HEAVEN NOR ON EARTH
UH THROUGH DOORS LIKE 
SNAKES WE SLIDE
WORDS ARE UNWRITTEN
OUR NUMBER UNKNOWN
FALLING LIKE RAIN FROM THE SKY

UH YOUR KINGDOM COME
AS THE AEONS RETURN
DESECRATE THE HOLY LAND
AND BLIND BELIEVE
UH YOUR VENOM FLOWS
LIKE FLOOD WE PASS
TO ERRECT THE RIGHTFUL KING

MISERY  SUFFERING  BLASPHEMY AGAINST YOUR GOD
WARRIORS  DEATHMACHINES  AS HE HANGS UPON THE CROSS
WE MUST DESTROY
WE MUST INSTALL
WE MUST REGAIN
THE PONTIFEX 666
MISERY  SUFFERING  AND FOREVER THEY SHALL REST
WARRIORS DEATHMACHINES  A SPACE NOONE HAS EVER WALKED
WE MUST RESTORE
WE MUST REGAIN
WE MUST ERRECT
THE SACRIFICE 666

YOU HAVE MOUTHS 
BUT CANNOT SPEAK
EYES, BUT CANNOT SEE
WE FORM THE LIGHT
BUT ARE OF DARKNESS
THE BRIGHT ONE SON OF THE DAWN
YOUR DEAD SHALL RISE

UH YOUR WILL BE DONE
AS THE AEONS GO BY
AGAIN TO RESTORE THE TRUE KING
TO THY THRONE
UH ALL ELECT ONES

DWELLERS IN THE DUST
AWAKE AND SING
YOUR DEW IS A RADIANT DEW
BENEATH MY FEET
HELL IS PREPARED
STIRRED UP TO GREET
AND MEET YOU WHEN YOU COME

UH YOUR WILL BE DONE
AS THE AEONS GO BY
AGAIN TO RESTORE THE TRUE KING
TO THY THRONE
UH ALL ELECT ONES

MISERY  SUFFERING  BLASPHEMY AGAINST YOUR GOD
WARRIORS  DEATHMACHINES  WE SPIT UPON THE CROSS
WE MUST ERASE
FROM THE SURFACE OF EARTH
THE DAMNED CHRISTIAN LIES
PONTIFEX 666
MISERY  SUFFERING  WITH HATRED IN OUR HEARTS
WARRIORS DEATHMACHINES  A RAGING STORM OF BLASPHEMY
WE MUST RESTORE
WE MUST REGAIN
WE MUST ERECT
