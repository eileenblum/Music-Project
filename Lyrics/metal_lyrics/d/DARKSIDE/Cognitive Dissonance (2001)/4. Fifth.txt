[Words: W. SÃ¼ssenbeck / Music: BÃ¶hm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]

THERE IS NO GOD WHERE I AM
THE SORROW OF PAIN AND REGRET
ARE LEFT TO THE DEAD AND DYING
CARESSED BY MAGNIFICENT BEASTS

I AM THE SNAKE
I AM ALONE

THEN THERE IS RAPTURE ON EARTH
AND I AND THE EARTH ARE ONE
THERE IS GREAT DANGER IN ME
IN THE DAY OF YOUR WRATH

I AM THE SNAKE
I AM ALONE

PRAISE THE WHORE   
FOR HER POWER`S DIVINE
RAISE THE DEAD    

FROM THE VAULTS OF DESPAIR
HEIR TO THE THRONE 

ANCESTORS FROM THE PAST
ARCHANGEL`S LAST COMMAND  

YOU SEE TO DIE IS AT HAND

OUT OF THE DARK DEPTHS OF HELL MY ARMIES ARISE
THE ETERNAL QUEST FOR THE EMPIRE`S CROWN HAS BEGUN

THE SERPENT FLAME THEREIN
MY COLOUR IS BLACK TO THE BLIND
I WHO AM ALL PLEASURE AND PURPLE
AND HER EYES SHALL BURN WITH DESIRE

I AM LIFE
GIVER OF LIVE

LET THE LIGHT DEVOUR MEN
EAT THEM UP WITH BLINDNESS
ON THE LOW MEN TRAMPLE
IN THE FIERCE LUST OF THE PRIDE

I AM THE SNAKE
I AM ALONE

PRAISE THE WHORE   

FOR HER POWER`S DIVINE
RAISE THE DEAD    

FROM THE VAULTS OF DESPAIR
HEIR TO THE THRONE 

ANCESTORS FROM THE PAST
ARCHANGEL`S LAST COMMAND  

YOU SEE TO DIE IS AT HAND

I AM THE MASTER OF FEAR
THOU ART THE HOLY CHOSEN ONE
NOW LET IT BE FIRST UNDERSTOOD
I AM A GOD

I AM THE SNAKE
I AM ALONE

IN MY SECRET TEMPLE
I AM THE DAUGHTER OF SUNSET
I AM THE NAKED NIGHTSKY
AROUSE THE COLD SPLENDOUR WITHIN

PRAISE THE WHORE   

FOR HER POWER`S DIVINE
RAISE THE DEAD    

FROM THE VAULTS OF DESPAIR
HEIR TO THE THRONE 

ANCESTORS FROM THE PAST
ARCHANGEL`S LAST COMMAND  

YOU SEE TO DIE IS AT HAND

OUT OF THE DARK DEPTHS OF HELL MY ARMIES ARISE
THE ETERNAL QUEST FOR THE EMPIRE`S CROWN HAS BEGUN
