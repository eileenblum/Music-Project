[Words: W. SÃ¼ssenbeck / Music: BÃ¶hm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]

FOR ALL TIME IS UNTO HIM
WHEN THE STARS MARK THE TIME
THEY SHALL COME FORTH AGAIN 
AFTER THE DAY COMETH BLACK NIGHT

CHTULHU RISING
CHTULHU RISING
CHTULHU RISING
CHTULHU RISING

MAN`S DAY SHALL PASS
THEY SHALL RULE WHERE THEY ONCE RULED
HE SHALL SLEEP DEATH`S DREAM
UNTIL THE END OF THE AEON

AND THE GODS HAVE CURSED
AND THE SPAWN OF THE OLD ONES

DWELL NOW THE OLD ONES
NOT IN THE SPACES KNOWN UNTO MEN
THEY LINGER AND EVER AWAIT
THE TIME OF THEIR GRACIOUS RETURN

CHTULHU RISING
CHTULHU RISING
CHTULHU RISING
CHTULHU RISING

AND THE GODS HAVE CURSED ME
AND THE SPAWN OF THE OLD ONES

AND THE GODS HAVE CURSED
AND THE SPAWN OF THE OLD ONES
THE GHASTS WHO DWELLETH IN
ZIN`S ATROCIOUS PRIMORDIAL VAULTS

AND THE GODS HAVE CURSED ME
