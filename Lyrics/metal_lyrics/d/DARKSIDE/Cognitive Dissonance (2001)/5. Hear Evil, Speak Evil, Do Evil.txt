[Words: W. SÃ¼ssenbeck / Music: BÃ¶hm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]

I WAS TRUSTING YOUR LIES
BEFORE HE SPOKE TO ME
RAGE TESTIFIED
AND CAST SPELLS ON ME

SUFFER THOSE
WHO DARE TO CONFESS
ALL LIES I CAN`T TAKE
AND TEAR MY SOUL APART

HEAR EVIL, DO EVIL, SPEAK EVIL
THE WORD OF SIN IS JUST RESTRICTION
HEAR EVIL, SPEAK EVIL, DO EVIL
AS EXPRESSION OF TRUE WILL
HEAR EVIL, SPEAK EVIL, DO EVIL
BEAUTY AND STRENGTH, FORCE AND FIRE
HEAR EVIL, SPEAK EVIL, DO EVIL
BUT THERE IS THAT WHICH REMAINS

ONLY FOOLS LONG TO LIVE
IN LUSTFUL DESIRE
AND NO WORDS TO SPEAK
OF FORTUNE AND LIE

JUST PURE WILL
UNASSUAGED OF PURPOSE
DELIVERED FROM LUST
IS EVERY WAY PERFECT

IT`S MY TRUE BLOOD
HEAR MY TESTIMONY
GUIDES ME TO BELIEVE
IN DARK YEARS TO BE

FIND YOUR TRUE SELF
SO DO WHAT THOU WILT
IS THE WHOLE OF THE LAW
THERE`S NO LAW BEYOND

HEAR EVIL, DO EVIL, SPEAK EVIL
THE WORD OF SIN IS JUST RESTRICTION
HEAR EVIL, SPEAK EVIL, DO EVIL
AS EXPRESSION OF TRUE WILL
HEAR EVIL, SPEAK EVIL, DO EVIL
BEAUTY AND STRENGTH, FORCE AND FIRE
HEAR EVIL, SPEAK EVIL, DO EVIL
BUT THERE IS THAT WHICH REMAINS
