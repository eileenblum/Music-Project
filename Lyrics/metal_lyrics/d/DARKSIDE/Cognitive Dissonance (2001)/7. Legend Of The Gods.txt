THEIR CHILDREN ENDURETH THROUGHOUT
THE AGES YE SHANTAKS OF LENG
ARE THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS
THEY HAVE FATHERED THE NA-HAG

AND THE GAUNTS THAT RIDE THE NIGHT 
GREAT CHTULU IS THEIR BROTHER
UPON HIGH PLACES THE TEMPLES
OF THOSE WHOM NATURE OWNS NOT

THEIR BLASPHEMIES WERE GREAT UPON THE EARTH
ALL CREATIONS BOWED BENEATH THEIR MIGHT
AND KNEW THEM FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS
THE ELDER LORDS OPENED THEIR EYES

THE DOLES DO HOMMAGE UNTO THEM 
THEIR PRAISES BENEATH
THE PEAKS OF ANCIENT THROKS
THEY HAVE WALKED AMIDST THE STARS

IN THEIR WRATH THEYSET THEIR
HAND AGAINST THE OLD ONES
SLAYING THEM IN THE MIDST OF
THEIR INIQUITY AND CASTING

THEIR BLASPHEMIES WERE GREAT UPON THE EARTH
ALL CREATIONS BOWED BENEATH THEIR MIGHT
AND KNEW THEM FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS
THE ELDER LORDS OPENED THEIR EYES

LOATHSOME CHTULHU ROSE THEN
FROM THE DEEPS AND RAGED
WITH EXCEEDING GREAT FURY
AGAINST THE EARTH

THEY BOUND HIS VENOMOUS CLAWS
WITH POTENT SPELLS
SEALED HIM UP WITHIN THE CITY OF R`HLEY

THEIR BLASPHEMIES WERE GREAT UPON THE EARTH
ALL CREATIONS BOWED BENEATH THEIR MIGHT
AND KNEW THEM FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS
THE ELDER LORDS OPENED THEIR EYES
