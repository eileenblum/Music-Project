[Words: W. SÃ¼ssenbeck / Music: BÃ¶hm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]

SEE THIS TRAP CLOSE ON YOUR LIFE
FEEL THE THRILL YOU CUT THROUGH FLESH

CRAVING BLOOD TO PULL SOME HATE
THIS IS DIVINE

I HAVE THE RIGHT
AND YOUR DEATH BECOMES MY DELIGHT
MINE IS THE NIGHT
BLEED FOR MY PLEASURE  
BLOODBOUND

I HAVE THE RIGHT
AND YOUR BLOOD BECOMES MY WORLD
MINE IS THE MIGHT
SUFFER THE MADNESS 
BLOODBOUND

KILL RIGHT ON SO CLOSE TO EXSTACY
SMILE IN THE FACE A REAL BELIEVE
TRY THE WORDS TO CALL AWAKENING
WALK THESE FIELDS OF KILLING ME

BLOOD
WILL
FLOW
IN DESTINY

OFFER ME  PAIN
YOU SUFFER MORE
OFFER ME BLOOD
I CRAWL UP YOUR FACE
OFFER ME  RAGE
MY BELLY REVOLTS
OFFER ME BLOOD
LEAVING NO TRACE

BLOOD
REVEALS
MY GAIN
IT`S REAL

OPEN THE CAGE OF RED WAVES
AS I CUT YOUR FLESH IN WILD DELIGHT
FORGING FLESH TO PULL SOME STAKE
THIS IS DIVINE
I HAVE THE RIGHT
AND YOUR DEATH BECOMES MY DELIGHT
MINE IS THE NIGHT
BLEED FOR MY PLEASURE  
BLOODBOUND

I HAVE THE RIGHT
AND YOUR BLOOD BECOMES MY WORLD
MINE IS THE MIGHT
SUFFER THE MADNESS BLOODBOUND

DROPS OF LIQUID CLOSE TO EXSTACY
SMILE ON MY LIPS A REAL BELIEVE
CRIES OF PAIN THEY CALL FOR MERCY
WALK THE SEA OF PURPLE WAVES

BLOODBOUND
BLOODBOUND
