[Words: W. SÃ¼ssenbeck / Music: BÃ¶hm, Pichlbauer, Koritar]

SUFFERING THE DEMONS SLEEP
AND THE RAGE CONTROLS MY MIND
WE`RE SUPPOSED TO FACE THE END
SOMEONE IS TO TRY

AND MY EYES CAN SEE
CONTROLS A GLIMPSE OF MY MIND
IF YOU FACE REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR LIFE

SUFFERING THE ANGELS WINGS
FOR THEIR SWAY AWAKES MY MIND
TO BE OPPOSED TO IGNORANCE
SOMEONE IS TO DIE

ABHORRENCE RISE 
ABOVE THE GROUND
WIPE THE WEAK FROM THIS PLACE
TO SET THE TRUTH TO ZERO
SHARING THIS PAIN 
SHARING THIS HATE
FACE YOUR HATE IT`S ALWAYS HERE
ANGER RISES IN YOUR HEART

AND MY EARS CAN HEAR
DESTROYS THE SELFISH DISSONANCE
IF YOU HEAR REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR MIND

RAGING SO MUCH RAGING SO BAD
FACE YOUR DEATH IT`S ALWAYS HERE
DISCREPANCY OF COGNITION
RELIEF IS DEATH FOR ME

AND MY EYES CAN SEE
CONTROLS A GLIMPSE OF MY MIND
IF YOU FACE REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR LIFE

IGNORANCE LIKE SHADES DECEIT
FOR ITS GLAMOUR RULES THIS EARTH
TO WALK ACROSS THIS FIRY PATH
SOMEONE IS TO COME

ABHORRENCE RISE 
ABOVE THE GROUND
WIPE THE WEAK FROM THIS PLACE
TO SET THE TRUTH TO ZERO
SHARING THIS PAIN 
SHARING THIS HATE
FACE YOUR HATE IT`S ALWAYS HERE
ANGER RISES IN YOUR HEART

AND MY EARS CAN HEAR
DESTROYS THE SELFISH DISSONANCE
IF YOU HEAR REALITY
IT CONSUMES YOUR MIND
