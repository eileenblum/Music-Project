near autumn walls I'm seeking shadows
dark fears - an anthem of this time
damnation - the dreamers heart
overflown with purple red
melancholia of a dying world
follows my step as I walk
a stranger on the graveyard
towards the black swords of lie

dreaming they rise
from dark eons decayed men
black gates effuse
dying angels with cold brows

dark rooms senseless
bony hands
tortured blue unholy child
rat naws doorway
heart stone sad
cold fever halls purple death

darkness emotion
hunger condamned
fouling darkness
swords of lie
garden of orphans
unholy grave
red barchetta on the channel
life

lost life gained death
is the feeling in my heart
as I cross the rivers'edge
then my spirit will be set free
