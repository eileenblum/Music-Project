this is the story of a king called Sardon, who ruled over a land called
Usketnan long time before our history. at the beginning of our story you
can find yourself in the inner sanctum of the main temple, where a
mysterious woman appears and tells the king about a possibility to leave
their old state overshadowed by hunger, wars and chaos. outside the
people have ensembled and wait for the decision of their leader.

[Chapter One]
[The Ritual]

nshigtur, the strange woman helps the king to get over his premonitions
after his speech. she encourages him and promises him a better future.

[KING:]
what can I do, my force is gone
hunger, plague, war and chaos rule!
who is that woman, what is she about
listen to my cries, release me from pain!

[NSHIGTUR:]
come with me into eternal life

[KING:]
can I believe her, can I trust
fear rules my mind as she controls my senses
what will the future bring?
can she release my pain?
is there a reason within?
this woman drives me insane

[NSHIGTUR:] I can be your promised land
[KING:] where will the journey end, what will be in its end?
[NSHIGTUR:] feel my force inside your head!
[KING:] her force ties me - haunts me - thrills me
[NSHIGTUR:] people will survive again
[KING:] can I believe your promises to be true?
[NSHIGTUR:] come with me to promised land
[KING:] death or freedom, what waits for me?
[NSHIGTUR:] over!

with a strange noise, nshigtur starts the ritual
and at its end the imaginative journey through space starts

[NSHIGTUR:]
la pomovalatep ihas rasiks

fach es ra troke sofsledan
bas er se tschory fot ern

[Chapter Two]
[Stranded]

the arrival. the new land is very strange,
everything is very geometric and black,
the people are afraid and nervous.

[NSHIGTUR:] now you're caught in my land
[KING:] what have I done?
[NSHIGTUR:] got your future in my hand
[KING:] what will it be?
[NSHIGTUR:] people will be slaves again
[KING:] never again!
[NSHIGTUR:] my kingdom is revenge for you
[KING:] no!!!
[NSHIGTUR:] your king lays in chains
[KING:] laying in chains
[NSHIGTUR:] no turnig back again
[KING:] want to be free
[NSHIGTUR:] enslaved in my hand, hate is your fate!
[KING:] noo!!!

suddenly a storm of stones begins, panic and hysteria rule.
nshigtur laughs and disillusionates the people.

[KING:]
smashed me, trashed me, laid me in chains
my people enslaved, deranged, eternal pain!

end of the storm. nshigtur incarcerates the king and presents
herself as the new queen of noohoorsh.
the people don't dare any resistance.
years pass by and the people are living in poverty and pain.

[NSHIGTUR:]
your blood is my life
through your misery I gain strenghth
obey to the diction of noohoorsh
as I 'm your life, your blood, your king
surrender to me!
hail me!

[Chapter Three]
[Revelation]

naramsu'sha, the keeper of the tables,
is already an old man but he still seeks the reason for all this.
as he sits by a black lake and listens to the sounds of whales
he decides to go to the queens library
with all the old writings and books to find out the truth.

[NARAMSU'SHA:]
now I know why, the reason for all insanity
noohoorsh is damned, in my mind is clarity
nshigtur must die, she brings only misfortune
sardon has lost, the battle for eternity
