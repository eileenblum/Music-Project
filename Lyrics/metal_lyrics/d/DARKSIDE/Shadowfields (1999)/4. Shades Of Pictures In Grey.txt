lonesome under stars tent
walks through the silent hour
boy wakes out of weird dreams
his face decaying it seems

crazed woman with open hair
in the window staring barred
on the pond on sweet drive
lovers journeying wonderful

dark is the sound of springs rain in the night
drops of my blood falling onto golden plates
in myrial coffins a laughter whorish and wise
lust of my heart songs of madness and night

killer smiling bleach in the wine
the sick caught by mortal fear
nuns pray naked and wound
before gods pain on the cross

lonesome under stars tent
walks through the silent hour
boy wakes out of weird dreams
his face decaying like it seems
