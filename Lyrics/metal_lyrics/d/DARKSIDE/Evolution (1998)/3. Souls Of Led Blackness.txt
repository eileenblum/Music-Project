my soul gave birth to bleeding-purple skies
my heart is steaming with deadly, soilent lust

well of furious mind made pictures of unnatural mights
commanding my will
moved by nameless chants and the breath of eternal mights
ruling this earth
cities painted in flames
with the horror piling the eons
of godless creations
gods crashing down saint harps smashed to pieces
with blasphemic rhymes

I shall deny all powers on earth
for they are only nothing from nothing in real
fire I bring and light to the world you live in
for your souls are hopelessly lost

lowered by sin
again I shall rise
you fools, how small you are just in confronts to me

I decide on all of your fate
resisting to all
for my will is the strenghth and the power to call
I arise enlightening your souls of led blackness
for nothing is real
lowered by sin...

nothing restrains my power of will
not being a dog having to bow
I am I will I create am nothing and all
space and time
body and soul

lowered by sin...
on wings of freedom I fly not being a bird in the skies above
on through your souls I crawl
not being a snake, having to crawl

power enlightens the souls of led blackness
breaking your will
follow the roots of power and you will be just
forgotten ones
