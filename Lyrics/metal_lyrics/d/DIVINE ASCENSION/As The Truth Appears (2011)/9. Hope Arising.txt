Do you believe?
Hope will arise
Do you believe?
Hope will arise
Ending nightsâ¦of insanity

In a darkened room
When thereâs nobody there
I await for my cross to bare
In a shallow world
I despise what I see
And I wait for them all to be
Aware

Are we destined to be
In a world without care
I await solidarity
In a heartless world
I despise what I see
And I wait for them all to be
Aware

And hate that we have ever shown
Embrace the pain that we have ever known
And hold the hope rising

Do you believe?
Hope will ariseâ¦ending nights of insanity

Is there anyone out there?
To hear me scream
I drown in sorrow
For whatâs to be
Is there anyone out there?
So call to me
Come lift me higher
Iâm begging please

And hate that we have ever shown
Embrace the pain
Hold the hope rising

Do you believe?
Hope will ariseâ¦ending nights of insanity
