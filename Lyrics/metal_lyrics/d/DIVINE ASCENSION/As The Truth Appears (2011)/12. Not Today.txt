The day is long
And sense unclear
Suppress all needs
Forbidden fear

When drowned in guilt
Though half as sane
This liquid gauze
Wonât ease the pain

So Today my inhibitions
They will need no say
I take the road thatâs never travelled on
Only I will know the way

And let my heart take control
Let my mind follow the soul
Give my melodies for you to play
But I wonât unhand my secrets
Not Today

The winds of change
In step they ease
When yesterday
Looms over me
For ecstasy I canât deny
I need to know
How it feels to fly

So Today
My exhibitions I will need no more
I take the road thatâs never stumbled on
Pull my eyes up off this floor

And let my heart take control
Let my mind follow the soul
Give my melody for you to play
But I wonât unhand my silence
Not Today

Let my heart take control
Let my mind follow the soul
Give my melody for you to play
But I wonât unhand my mystery
Not Today

I wonât unhand my mystery
Not Today
