I am your Queen your beautiful angel
I solely maintain my faith in you
And as your Queen your beautiful angel
I will bare you a son so pure and true

A son so strong so his back shall never break
A son so sovereign so his hand may never shake
A son so Godly so his blood may never spill
So you may hand him your shoes to fill

Look to the light
The Gods are calling you tonight
Look in his eyes
Osiris knows the way to your desire
In your hands lies the key to these lands
Close is the day
So fall the sands of time

Oh my son, look to your father
You are the heir to Pharaohs throne
Oh my son, look to your father
Your father has built you this kingdom from stone

His wisdom lies within the lines upon his face
He will embark on a journey to another place
His footsteps you will trace

Look to the light
The gods are calling you tonight
Look in his eyes
Osiris knows the way to your desire
In your hands lies the key to these lands
Close is the day
So fall the sands of time

The afterlife is waiting for you
My Kingâ¦I know this to be true
Your rebirth will mark the light
The Gods will guide you there tonight
We will pray to Re and the sun will rise
So fall the sands of time

Oh Osiris you giver you taker
Oh Osiris you slayer you maker

Look to the light
The gods are calling you tonight
Look in his eyes
Osiris knows the way to your desire
In your hands lies the key to these lands

He will place his hands on your shoulders
He will guide you as you grow older
Close is the day
So fall the sands of time
So fall the sands of time
