Sometimes I donât understand
The world can come crashing down
Sometimes an ocean seems to rise
Enough to pull me in and take me

Emotions break my inner safe
And toil with anguish and despair
Shattered glass does my heart make
I clear the mess and you are there

Stifled rhythm barren hope
As demons call for my sanity
Hear the echo through my mind
Feel your answer render them blind

Have you become my keeper?
Always there with a healing hand
Have you become my keeper?
Right before my eyes â my Vision Divine

The time of need is always here
Within your wings of shelter hides my fear

I emerge enlightened by your strength
You hold the flame, to shine the light and guide the way
You guide the way

Have you become my keeper?
Always there with a healing hand
Have you become my keeper?
Right before my eyes â my Vision Divine
You can render them blind

Emotions break my inner safe
And toil with anguish and despair
Shattered glass does my heart make
I clear the mess and you are there
Stifled rhythm barren hope
As demons call for my sanity

Have you become my keeper?
Always there with a healing hand
Have you become my keeper?
Right before my eyes â my Vision Divine
You can render them blind

My Vision Divine
You can render them blind
My Vision Divine
