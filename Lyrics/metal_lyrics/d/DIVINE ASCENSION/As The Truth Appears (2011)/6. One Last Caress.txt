Now Iâm gonna take from
All you took from me
For now I can be sure

How could you leave me in the cold with all that I endured?
You swore reform you crossed your heart
And I believedâ¦..you

You broke my heart in two
And left the pieces strewn upon the floor
Youâ¦ stole my breath away
Nothing remains only the emptiness

One Last Caress is all it takes to wash away your pain
One Last Caress to send you on your way
Iâ¦believed you
Iâ¦swore youâd make amends
Iâ¦withheld from you
One Last Caress

Now you return to feed my heart with endless tempting words
You promised ever after
And I surrendered

Youâ¦ stole my breath away
Nothing remains only the emptiness

One Last Caress is all it takes to wash away your pain
One Last Caress to send you on your way
Iâ¦believed you
Iâ¦swore youâd make amends
Iâ¦withheld from you
One Last Caress

Withhold my hand, withhold my heart
I will be strongâ¦.so long

Iâ¦believed you
Iâ¦swore youâd make amends
Iâ¦withheld from you
One Last Caress is all it takes to wash away your pain
One Last Caress to send you on your way
One Last Caress
