Where are the dreams of yesterday?
I donât see it in our eyes anymore
I turn away from here

Standing on this shore
Looking out for lifeâs melody
I search for why no one believes
That the truth is out thereâ¦so

Into the unknown
Where lies are being kept
Tales we were told before
To wage in this war
Where lives are being spent
Seems way too much to answer for

Thereâs only one way out of here
Out of this dark blinding sea
Fortune smiles knowingly
Thereâs only one way out of here
Away from the oncoming storm
To come out Unscathed

Now that we feel our own decay
A little fear in our eyes all I saw
With no abate from here
How we yearn for more
Never asking why history
Speaks again yet never steersâ¦and reappears

To wage in this war
Where time never seeks to wait
For whatâs in store

Thereâs only one way out of here
Out of this dark blinding sea
Fortune smiles knowingly
Thereâs only one way out of here
Away from the oncoming storm
To come out Unscathed

Beyond the realm of hate and hidden storm
Lies a world that never seems to feel alone

Another day and itâs nearly over
A thousand years we have cried yet a single tear
Another day and the fear is all around
A thousand years we became our own enemy
Way too much to answer for

Thereâs only one way out of here
Out of this dark blinding sea
Fortune smiles knowingly
Thereâs only one way out of here
Away from the oncoming storm
To come out Unscathed

Thereâs only one way out of here
Out of this dark blinding sea
Fortune smiles knowingly
Thereâs only one way out of here
Away from the oncoming storm
To come out Unscathed
