All alone in my dark abyss
I realise that light will fade
So when the rain falls
I never through Iâd ever feel the stain

Another day I suffer
In my own hidden world
The shame of which I speak
Is much more words

In the Garden of Evil
I will take you there
Where you will feel my pain
In the Garden of Evil
I must take you there
Where you will feel my misery

Standing on such sacred earth
I finalise my epitaph
And in the days that follow
I walk towards no return
The path of which I seek
Is much more than words

In the Garden of Evil
I will take you there
Where you will feel my pain
In the Garden of Evil
I must take you there
Where you will feel my misery

I almost pray to the world
For a sign
Of that which I ever seek
I never seem to find

In the Garden of Evil
I will take you there
Where you will feel my pain
In the Garden of Evil
I must take you there
Where you will feel my misery
My misery
