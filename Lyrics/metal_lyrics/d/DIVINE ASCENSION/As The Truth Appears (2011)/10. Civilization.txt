All alone deep inside your mind
Thereâs a pain that is real
So hard to define
Look around itâs there for you to see
How I wish you were here with me

Civilisation
The grand design
Is so very only
Way beyond all your reasoning
There youâll find a better day
And a better way

When the road is so long and divides
When you cower in fear
Nowhere to hide
Look around itâs there for you to see
How I wish you were here with me

Civilisation
Like winterâs breeze
Is so very cold
Way beyond all your conditioning
There youâll find a better day
And a better way

So when your search for inner peace
Becomes much more than youâve bargained for
All you long for is release
So in the hope that all is lost
The sky will get so much clearer now
All you need is guidance there

So you shall see
Civilisation
The grand design
Is so old yet alive
Yet itâs so very cold
Way beyond all your reasoning
There youâll find
A better day
And a better way

When the road is so long and divides
Look around itâs there for you to see

How I wish you were here
How I wish you were here
How I wish you were here
How I wish you were here
