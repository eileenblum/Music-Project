Itâs time to step aside
Now that our love has died

Emotionally and physically
Iâm drained to the core
Crouching in my happy place
Cradling my wounds of war

You like to lay the blame with me
Something that comes naturally
I need to find a place to rest
Reasons lost in wilderness

I wonât attempt to diagnose
You never held the cure
The poison seeped into the tree
Yet the apple seemed so damn pure

Days roll into weeks and we
We have it sweet in harmony
So intense you make me feel
Emotions strong and so unreal

No one wins, and nothingâs gained
Why are you leaving me?
From all this guilt and all this pain
Give me an answer
Strength was all I needed
Why not believe in me?
Believe in me

Give me an answer
No one wins, and nothingâs gained
Why are you leaving me?
A silent promise truth be named

Youâve been burned from one betrayal
Why not believe in me?

So step aside

Days roll into weeks and we
We have it sweet in harmony
So intense you make me feel
Emotions strong and so unreal
Then i lose track of your words
Entangled selfish and disturbed
Why build a bridge that just falls down
You always find a way
