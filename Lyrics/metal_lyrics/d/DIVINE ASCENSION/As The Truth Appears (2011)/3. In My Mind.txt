How longâ¦will we fear?
Itâs a dangerous time
For the realm of the blind
Will we beâ¦so free

How to be so far from here
How to be so far
How to be so far from here
How to be so far

We dwell among the souls of hollow man
Poison our minds with the love of green
Unbalanced power held in greedy hands
Betrayal of life by authority
More than we see

In my mindâ¦I never meant to walk away
In my mindâ¦I will turn to you and say
In my mindâ¦I never meant to lose control
In my mindâ¦I will turn to you and say
I will fly foreverâ¦In my mind

It is the children afraid to fall asleep
Helplessness of unconscious dream
Broken promise of eternal peace
Is who we are make the elders weep
Or am I dreaming

In my mindâ¦I never meant to walk away
In my mindâ¦I will turn to you and say
In my mindâ¦I never meant to lose control
In my mindâ¦I will turn to you and say
I will fly foreverâ¦In my mind

We seek all the answers untold
Thereâs a story behind every lie
Donât speak
All your lies I have heard
Wonât reach
My mind I have learned
How to be so far from here

In my mindâ¦I never meant to walk away
In my mindâ¦I will turn to you and say
I will fly forever

In my mindâ¦I never meant to walk away
In my mindâ¦I will turn to you
In my mindâ¦I never meant to walk away
In my mindâ¦I will turn to you and say
I will fly foreverâ¦In my mind
In my mind
