Youâ¦come take my hand
Iâll lead you to
The other side of destiny
Takeâ¦this bleeding heart
Now that you do
Discover inside whatâs left of me

Now that youâre deep in the dark
Confusion you show
The sorrow you feel
The hate that you show
And in your wildest dreams
Will you ever know

Iâll be the night that haunts you
Iâll be the one, who makes you burn
Itâs in the way I feel
And in the sky above you
Iâll be the one
Who makes you learn
Another Battlefield

Doâ¦you understand
The pain deep in you
Remnants of time you turn from me
Maybe in your wildest dreams
Will you ever know

Iâll be the night that haunts you
Iâll be the one, who makes you burn
Itâs in the way I feel
And in the sky above you
Iâll be the one
Who makes you learn
Another Battlefield

How you mend your wings (mend your wings)
Understand the way I feel
How you now continue on (mend your wings)
Is the way you remain

So when your mind betrays you
Youâll reach the point of no return
Youâll know just how I feel
And when the light surrounds you
Iâll be the one who now returns
Another Battlefield

And when the light surrounds you
Iâll be the one who now returns
Another Battlefield
