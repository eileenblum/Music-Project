As the sun rises over the land
To trace the sands, it warms my hands
I awake as the truth appears
With balance in our hearts
We face the fear

Into the deep the deep we go
The threat of war we know
If we embrace the power of earth, wind and fire
Weâll see how far we go
Put on a perfect show and shine
We can balance on a wire

Another reason to despise what we see
A life less ordinary
Yet we are Visionary
Another reason to deny fantasy
A life less ordinary
Yet we are Visionary

When strangers see each other eye to eye
What we hold close, does well inside
Behold a vision of a perfect world
Itâs buried in the past
To reappear

With our collective minds
United purpose âcross the land
We can formulate our plan

Another reason to despise what we see
A life less ordinary
Yet we are Visionary
Another reason to deny fantasy
A life less ordinary
Yet we are Visionary

With our collective minds
United purpose âcross the land
We can formulate our plan

Another reason to despise what we see
A life less ordinary
Yet we are Visionary
Another reason to deny fantasy
A life less ordinary
Yet we are Visionary

Into the deep we go
The threat of war we know
We can be wiser
Another reason to deny fantasy
A life less ordinary
Yet we are Visionary
