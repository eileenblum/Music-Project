Whoa... when tension takes its toll
Defeating us again
There is no reason
Whoa... when tension takes its toll
Defeating us again
There is no reason


So... set aside your pride and deep desires
And you will be the hero in our eyes

The one that walked away
To seize the day
Only to face apprehension
Live with no regret
Never to forget
You'll always be the liberator

And you... you'll feel no shame
We'll meet again
For different reasons
And oh... when you look back now I hope you see
You paved the way for harmony
Harmony

The one that walked away
To seize the day
Only to face apprehension
Live with no regret
Never to forget
You'll always be the liberator

All that comes is pain when you try opening closed doors
You cant look back it just be like it was before
If you need a second, a moment to reflect
And inch to give, nothing more, never to forget

The one who walked away
To seize the day
Only to face apprehension
Live with no regret
Never to forget
You'll always be the one who walked away
Liberator
To seize the day
Only to face apprehension
Live with no regret
Never to forget
You'll always be the liberator whoa... when tension takes its toll
Defeating us again
There is no reason


So... set aside your pride and deep desires
And you will be the hero in our eyes

Only to face apprehension
Live with no regret
