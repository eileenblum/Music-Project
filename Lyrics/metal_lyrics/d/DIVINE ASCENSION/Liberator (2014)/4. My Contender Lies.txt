Face to face do we contend
Cuts to deep to mend
What lies around the bend

In search for answers we have found
We're safe on foreign ground
Far from immune
Too much too soon

We've had our differences
This much is true
But I will risk everything
I will fight for you

One step beyond
One chance to rise above it all
Where I belong
A compromise
My contender lies

Face to face and strong to head
With skin to thick to shred
But there's harder times ahead
Yet we've come to find a place
Where patience shows her face
And time apart helps mend my heart

Do we know better?
Can we find truth?
I will risk everything
I will fight for you

One step beyond
One chance to rise above it all
Where I belong
A compromise
My contender lies

Once we are learned
Twice we are glutton
Twice we are solvent
Whoa... whoa
And when my red sky turns to grey
The worst has shaken
Whoa
I will fight for you

One step beyond
One chance to rise above it all
Where I belong
A compromise
My contender lies
