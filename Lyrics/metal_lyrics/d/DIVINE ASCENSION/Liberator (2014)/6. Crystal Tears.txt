You are some kind of mystery
And I need to strip your disguise
You heighten my senses
When you move with my stride
How long will you tempt me?
You're something I can't deny
I died when I looked in your eyes

Once so precious now is broken
Truth has been denied
Oh, your touch is just a token
Crystal tears I cry

Crystal tears I cry
Through lonely nights
For the sake of little gain
Will you justify
The pain I feel inside?
Just enough to wash away

Oh, you're looking for someone
It's written all over your face
I just want a piece of
Your hunger you taste
Its a fatal attraction
And it's something I can't deny
But I died when I looked in your
Eyes...

Once so precious now is broken
Truth has been denied
Oh your touch is just the token
Crystal tears I cry

Crystal tears I cry
Through the lonely nights
For the sake of little gain
Will you justify
The pain I feel inside?
Just enough to wash away

Oh, it feels like fate has deceived me
I'm a casualty and nothing more
You absorb all my energy
With crystal clarity at my core

Once so precious now is broken
Truth has been denied
Oh your touch is just the token
Crystal tears I cry

Crystal tears I cry
Through the lonely nights
For the sake of little gain
Will you justify
The pain I feel inside?
Just enough to wash away
