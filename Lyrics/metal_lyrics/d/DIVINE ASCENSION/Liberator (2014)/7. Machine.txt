Retrospective of an age
With little time to turn the pages over
So we practice what we preach
Just another mere machine to teach

One of these days
I'll escape
Push the race
And I'll find a new way
When the grind dictates your time
There's no room to fall behind
So I wake to that same old feeling

Just to be one more machine
Pre-programmed to be the same
When morning wakes I refuse to believe
I'm just one more machine

Revelation for an age
Diversify mine to escape the drover
Evict my need to unify
There's something more that I have long denied

And I walk free
I walk free from this machine

Taking chances my own way
So desires don't go to waste
Here I go, I'm on the road to somewhere

I won't be one more machine
Pre-programmed to be the same
There's something more and I need to believe
I won't be one more machine

I am full of moving parts
Constructed not to fall apart
Impartial to take blame
Built for the common age
No, I'm not for trade
Yes, you should upgrade
Experience the new
Improving the version of you

Seek to challenge the unknown
Everyday 'til I grow old
'Cause I choose to live a life worth living

I'm not just one more machine
Pre-programmed to be the same
There's something more and I choose to believe
I'm not just one more machine

I am full of moving parts
Constructed not to fall apart
Impartial to take blame
Built for the common age
No, I'm not for trade
Yes, you should upgrade
Experience the new
Avoiding coercion
A shiny new version of you
