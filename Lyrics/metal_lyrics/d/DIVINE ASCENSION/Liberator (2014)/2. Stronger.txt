You used to reach for my hand
And I would follow
Follow you into the fire
Lose sight of tomorrow

How can I wash my hands clean
Of this disgrace
Somehow I lost sight of me
In your embrace

Awake me from the dark
My soul will bear the mark
Needless to say I was ill-advised
I was hypnotized
In your dangerous eyes
I was so damn blind
Now I choose to fight
If there is a chance
I will take it
I can make it
'Cause I'm stronger, wiser in every way
Stronger, braver than yesterday
Reaching higher
Now I know there's no limit

I open my arms to the world
'Cause I'm stronger

I feel the danger in your eyes
Keep them away
Alive in the new light of mirth
Now I'm awake

Awoken from the dark
I'll always bare the the mark
Needless to say I was ill-advised
I was hypnotized
In your dangerous eyes
I was so damn blind
Now I choose to fight
If there is a chance
I will take it
I can make it
'Cause I'm stronger, wiser in every way
Stronger, braver than yesterday
Reaching higher
Now I know there's no limit

I open my arms to the world
'Cause I'm stronger
I'm stronger

I was ill-advised
I was hypnotized
In your dangerous eyes
I was so damn blind
Now I choose to fight
If there is a chance
I will take it

'Cause I'm stronger, wiser in every way
Stronger, braver than yesterday
Reaching higher
Now I know there's no limit

I open my arms to the world
'Cause I'm stronger
Stronger
