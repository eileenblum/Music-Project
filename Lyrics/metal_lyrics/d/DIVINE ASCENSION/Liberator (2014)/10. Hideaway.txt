Persistence is the answer when reaching for the stars
Never for a moment forgetting who we are
Fate shows its face in such strange ways
And its leading us right to the glory days
We'll prove you right we're out to fight the very best
And worthy we will be ooh yeah

We're out to get ya

Living in our secret hideaway
Look how far we've come in just one day
Hide your breath together we will climb

We're out to get ya

Thank you for your patience indulging all our flaws
Survive the very essence that burns you to the core
Not only reputation to defend
But knowing that its worth it in the end
If good things come for those who wait
We sign the slate and worthy we will be oh yeah
We're out to get ya...

Living in our secret hideaway
Look how far we've come in just one day
Hold your breath together we will climb
We're out to get ya...

Living in our secret hideaway
Look how far we've come in just one day
Hold your breath together we will climb
We're out to get ya...

Living in our secret hideaway
Look how far we've come in just one day
Hold your breath together we will climb
We're out to get ya...
