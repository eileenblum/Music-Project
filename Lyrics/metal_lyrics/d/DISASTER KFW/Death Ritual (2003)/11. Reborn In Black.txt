Drowned - in blood (and) reborn in black

Dark desires become my fate
Who will control the hate?
Bloodred is all I see
Who will be saving me?

Falling through a tube of fire
On my back  a cold shiver
Endless breathless seconds
In my  soul there's a sliver

Standing in the hall of pain
Now I'm born again?
Millions souls starring down at me
My thoughts are so in misery

Hear a diabolic whispering voice
"It's your own choice!"
See eyes like glittering emeralds
"Are you ready for your funeral?"

Choked - in blood (and) reborn in black

Dark desires become true
Despairation; through &amp; through
Death is all I see
Who will be saving me?

Waiting for the final sentence
Endless breathless seconds
Emptiness is all I feel
And the rising disbelief

Million souls starring down at me
My thoughts are so in misery
Standing in a hall of pain
"I will live again!"

The soul is ripped
And trapped in hell
I'm lost in pain
I can't live &amp; die again!
