Only a short Track
And the bloodiest
Way of all

Playground for warriors
Bloodthirsty slaughters
Psychotic Leaders

Attack the turmoil
Feel my burnin'
Sword of hate

Screams from the field-blood spills
Killed by an axe-gore hills
Breath the screams from the injured
Smell blood from death
Hear demonic oaths
Feel uprising souls
See dismembered corpses
Fear for yourself

Feel my hate
(It's) a pleasure to torment

Battlefield...

You're my first snack
I break your bones
And last your neck

Rip your heart in two
One half for me
And one for you

Without mercy I sacrifice
I don't said twice
Eat them alive

Screams from the field...

Feel my teeth
(My) immortal greed for flesh

Battlefield...

[Lyrics: Sepsis]
