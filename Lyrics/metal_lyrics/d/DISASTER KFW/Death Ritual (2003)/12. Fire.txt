Hear our loudest scream
You know who we mean
The nightmare in your dream

Wake up, wake up, don't shut your mouth
Against all the braindeads
All around the globe
Let's fight against commercial might

Fire, fire, fire, fire

Open up your eyes, than you realize
Your greed stinks to the sky, you can't deny
Stand all bastards on the wall: "Turn the table!" is our call
Grilled by our breath, your homestead is the death
Which way does your soul go? Will it fall in a brown hole?!
We tell all the fans: "Boycott commercial clans!"

In our eyes you're sad
Isn't your blood red?
We're the dreams you dread

Wake up, wake up, don't shut your mouth
Against all the braindeads
For a better mankind
Let's fight against commercial might

Fire, fire, fire, fire

Open up your eyes, than you realize
Your greed stinks to the sky, you can't deny
Stand all bastards on the wall: "Turn the table!" is our call
Grilled by our breath, your homestead is the death
Which way does your soul go? Will it fall in a brown hole?!
We tell all the fans: "Boycott commercial clans!"
