We're the chosen ones
We've damage done
We're kidnapped people from the streets
Mud under your feets
Waste in your eyes
We think you're public Mechandise
Give your soul a new hope
With a long rope
You wished you never met us
Wishes are nothing, but we are real
Dismember your body for a delicious meal
Nabbed - stored - ripped - cooked

(For a) death ritual

You lived your life in your perfect world
Thinking your money rules this fuckin' earth
Nobody hears you screaming now
Hanging with others like a slaughtered cow

(For a) death ritual

Now your bloody face
After the chase
Dead eyes &amp; a trembling body
Hey, don't be afraid
I'm your prophet
I give your life an important meaning
In my holy tombs
There are many wounds
Broken bones, spiced girls, you'll vomit
Wishes are nothing, but we are real
Dismember your body for a delicious meal

(For a) death ritual

Call the people, do what you want
Nobody hears you, it's a pleasure to kill
My instrument's sharp, I'm cutting your skin
You don't lose, you can only win

(For a) death ritual
