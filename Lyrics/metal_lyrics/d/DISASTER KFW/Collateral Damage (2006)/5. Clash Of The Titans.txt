On the battlefield again - eye for an eye
No way back - just silence
Thoughts are gone - feel the adrenalin rising
On the battlefield again - eye for an eye

Death for those who'll show weakness
No failure allowed - first blood flows
From my hands - from my sword
And the first warlords gone to glory

You want to change great things
But you won't h ave felicity
Mine is the triumph
Soon you will die

I want your death
Clash of the titans
I want your death
Clash of the titans

Hammer smashing down
And splitting your head
Screaming crusades and chipping bodies
My bloodlust is growing

Finally my dagger stabs your heart
Splitting you in two parts
Warm far - red blood spilling on my hands
To draw one's last breath

Death for those who'll show weakness
No failure allowed - first blood flows
From my hands - from my sword
And more warriors gone to glory

You want to change great things
But you won't have felicity
Clash of the titans
Mine is the triumph
Now you're dead
Clash of the titans
