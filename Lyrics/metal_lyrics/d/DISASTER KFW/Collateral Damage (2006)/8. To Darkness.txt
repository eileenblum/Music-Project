Now that you're gone
Tell me how it feels
Your soul fall downwards
Into the unknown - into darkness

Be quiet, the silence is everywhere
It's catching and holding you strong
Nothing to see with blinded eyes
Again - the fall into the deep

Welcome to darkness
Frustration may be all that you'll feel
Neverending pain - your sins are my food

Memories are passing by
Full of strange illusions
Cold shivers attack the antibody
Sickness comes overyou again

Can you comprehend: What's still growing?
Can you understand: What I'm wanting to do?
Remember: The contract you've made with me
This is our little part to justify yourself

Welcome to darkness
You have to conquer the seven rings
This is the beginning of the end

Welcome to darkness
Frustration may be all that you'll feel
Neverending pain - your sins are my food
