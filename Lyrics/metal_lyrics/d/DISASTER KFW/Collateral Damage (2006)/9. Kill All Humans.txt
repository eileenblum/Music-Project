Don't fear my knowledge, only my decision
The forsakened mankind live in a lie
Observed by cruelty tycoons
Exploited and condemned to die

Kill all humans
Kill, kill, kill, kill

....

The plan is simple
But one try only we have
This will be the solution for all
The final great show
Don't mourn to a dying world

Kill all humans
Kill, kill, kill, kill

Kill all humans

The red button glimpse so sweet
And be sure
Just one minute left
And all misery ends
The evil symphony makes the smile

The final solution: Kill all humans
