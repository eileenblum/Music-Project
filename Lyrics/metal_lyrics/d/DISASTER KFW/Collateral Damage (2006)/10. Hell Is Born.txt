The legions of the underworld
Standing in line
Waiting for the last command
To seek and destroy

My creatures crawl from down below
To bring chaos, plague, war and death

Hell is open - hell is here
On your knees again
Hell is born
Hell's on fire - hell awaits
We're born from pain
Hell is born

Unleashed are the hordes
to complete my dark reign
My vengeance, my anger, my fury, my hate
To rule them all with nothing but pain

My creatures crawl from down below
To bring chaos, plague, war and death

Hell is open - hell is here
On your knees again
Hell is born
Hell's on fire - hell awaits
We're born from pain
Hell is born
