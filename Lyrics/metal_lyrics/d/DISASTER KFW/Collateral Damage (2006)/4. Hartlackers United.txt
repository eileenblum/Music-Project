We drink 'till death
Cold beer and naked girls
We drink 'till death
Woman, alcohol and Heavy Metal

Passin' the entrance
Checkin' the bar
Local beer
Let's start drinkin' war
Stone cold and crazy
Tastin' some chicks
Everything that counts
Are asses and tits

Raise the beer to the sky
Hartlackers United
Hartlacker s United

They got the ring on the finger
But we don't care
Some bad language
Too much drinks
Fists are flying
Chaos is perfect

Some minutes later
Blood was spilled
We look at each other
Question the reason
Why fight for chicks
They are not worth
Let's all drink together
And toss our guts

Raise the beer to the sky
Hartlackers United
Hartlackers United
