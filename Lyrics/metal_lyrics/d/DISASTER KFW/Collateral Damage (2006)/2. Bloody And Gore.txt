You're life is in my hand
You're losing y our mind
And you know it

You're pain is my gain
No choice left
But no retreat

The Pilgrimage is annoying
It's mine your soul
All that will be left letters engraved in stone
One thing's for sure-bloody and gore

My blood-your Blood
Bloody and gore

Imagine the world falling down
Remember the king with no crown
The surface is filled with maggots
Fled from the cradle of life

Loosing your strength
Loosing your power
The end of the road
The soul's depraved

The pilgrimage is ending
It's mine your soul
All that will be left letters engraved in stone
One thing's for sure-bloody and gore
