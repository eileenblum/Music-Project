One, two, three: KILL!
You ask why
Just so easy: It's a boring life

One, two, three: KILL!
Love to break your bones
Love to smash your smile

The seventh attempt works
I've lost my patience six times
Collateral Damage

The journey ends right here
Strapped on the benc
You shiver with fear
Collateral Damage

I feel no regrets at all
Electric drills are my primary tools
Collateral Damage

The hole in your head
I've filled with honey instead
Collateral Damage

One, two, three: KILL!
You ask me why
Just so easy: It's a beautiful life

One, two, three: KILL!
Love to drink your blood
Love to see you suffer

One, two, three: KILL!
One, two, three, four: FIRE!
