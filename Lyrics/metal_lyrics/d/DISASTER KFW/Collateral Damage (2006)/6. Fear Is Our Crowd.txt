A snaredrum breaks the silence
Thousands of voices screaming loud
The pressure of the guitars beats you back
The heads are banging 'till breaking the neck

We like it heavy, we like it loud
Baning people, this' our crowd
We're standing strong, we're standing proud
Crowdsurfing people: This is our crowd

The battery sounds like thunder
Rising the fists towards the sky
The shouters growl leads the way
The raging crowd repeats and singin' out loud

We like it heavy, we like it loud
Banging people: This is our crowd
We're standing strong, we're standing proud
Crowdsurfing people, this is our crowd
