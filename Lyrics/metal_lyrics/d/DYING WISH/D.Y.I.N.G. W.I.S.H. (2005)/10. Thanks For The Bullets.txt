This day I'd like to thank you
All the bullets you shooted me
When you were sure
That I'm a perfect aim
One blind man saw my face
And asked me what I feel
My answer wasn't too great
So he told me: You won't escape

I warned you so many times
That won't be a prey
'Cause I will hunt you
Till your head will be my state

I visioned a brave new world
Without this killing spree
And then I saw your guns
And I get it won't mercy
You tried to stain my faith
With Your superficial life
What is a rotten shame
And a bloody dangerous lie

[Chorus:]
You are the sacrifice
Of my endless pain
And I taste your sweet tears
That you can't retain
You're looking at your salvation
Whilst I throw off disguise
And you feel you loose everything
And my power will arise

I see into your soul and
I'm playing with your belief
And you are a fugitive man
But won't find relief

This day I'd like to thank you
All the bullets you shooted me
When you were sure
That I'm a perfect aim
One blind man saw my face
And asked me what I feel
My answer wasn't too great
So he told me: You won't escape

[Chorus:]
You are the sacrifice
Of my endless pain
And I taste your sweet tears
That you can't retain
You're looking at your salvation
Whilst I throw off disguise
And you feel you loose everything
And my power will arise
