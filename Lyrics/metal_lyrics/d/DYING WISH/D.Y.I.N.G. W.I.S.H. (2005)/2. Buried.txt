I've lived buried all my life
Waiting for a sign
To get to know you better
To see if you're divine.

Each and every promise
Is a hypocritical lie
Without seeing your real face
I just don't want to die.

[Chorus:]
Years fly by with every minute
I am dead before I'm born.
I try to get out of my tomb
The struggle inside makes me torn.

I have lived forgotten
Since the thought entered my head
To beg for a beam of light,
New hope in the world of the Dead.

Each and every promise
You failed to keep
Made me stronger to believe
I'm the one to trust indeed.
