Who's sitting there
With dark eyes
Who gives an order
'gainst our life
Their prophet lies
About our death
Redemption will be
A simple test

You'll be saved
As long as you obey
We let you tell anytime
One of our prayer

[Chorus:]
So they don't know
Who we are,
And they don't mind
If we die
And we should keep
Our pride
And hide it for
The after-life

Incubator gives
Brand new image
What will a sign
On our brows
Any squender moments
(What) We left behind
Will be a statue
Above our casket rows
