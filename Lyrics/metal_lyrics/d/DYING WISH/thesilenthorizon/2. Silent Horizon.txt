I am standing.
Instead of my face the silent surface of the lake
Reflects the profile of an innocent infant
He used to escape from the world crying
And now he cannot belive it's the end

Hesitating smile on his face, bright tear in his eyes
In his glittering glance the life passes
His shadow sinks under the water
As if here the earth and the sky ended

On the corner of a dark room
I silently begin the first steps of a new life
Where there is no light, there is nobody to talk to
I build the walls of my loneliness alone

Where the darkness swallows the light 
Where the wall up to the sky does not allow
Your words to light a new candle

[Chorus:]
In the cold corner the reminder of your picture
Draws me the fireplace and the chill winter night 
Or the stars of the hot summer sky
Where for me the angel left her cold body behind

Walls surround me that i built
When i was a child, brick by brick
This world disappointed me

I am afraid there is nothing strange in saying this
Nothing but water if front of me, i have my face again
The child is gone, i am only gazing
My gregish temple reminds me
That i can depart bound for the unseen

[Chorus:]
In the cold corner the reminder of your picture
Draws me the fireplace and the chill winter night 
Or the stars of the hot summer sky
Where for me the angel left her cold body behind
