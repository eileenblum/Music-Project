Soflty ripples the dark river
I can see the moon among the branches of trees
At this dark summer night
I feel clear

[Chorus:]
Suddenly from the deep
Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me

A hand motions, asking me to come
I'm flying across the end of existence
And lost sight of calm lands

[Chorus:]

Suddenly from the deep
Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me

In an obscure - blue room
A child's voice is burning me
I'm painting on his body in red
His dead face is the first step
To an unknown deep

At the door of the new world
I feel what hides in me forever
To create a new like in a new universe
