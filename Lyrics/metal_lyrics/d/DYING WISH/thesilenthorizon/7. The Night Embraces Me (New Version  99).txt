The night's an offspring of black dreams
Everything's dark, the shades on the walls
Invite me
The memory of my dreams is a distant light
The wind groans the sign of my soul
The night embraces me

You've taken everything away
You've only left an empty snap
And this words that are dead since ages
The could universe
Has sticked to my face
The wishes have died somewhere

I'm only lying in the silence
The hours elapse on
Every memories are taken away by the dimness
My soul's dancing in a red-hot fire
I'm flying in the wind far away from the earth
