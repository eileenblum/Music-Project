Cold obscurity falls on me
Into my soul the winter to return
Whips of the storm shivered i hear
I waited for you, but you didn't come

Monotomy of misterious stars
Hit a nail to the coffin of dusk
My soul has crashed down under the beats
Just the loneliness gives shelter to me

A not happened embrace, a not happened kiss
One face what charms me in the dark
My knees hit the floor, it was a moment only
I'm sleeping, i will wake up somewhere else

I can't smell the scent anymore
That her skin breathed above silk pillows

[Chorus:]
I hate, when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me...
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me!

I feel that the wild burning desire
Is calmed by the steps of happines
The bright, shinning, rising sun is nice to me
When the first ray comes and rests by my side

Bride of darkness stood before me
Between walls and doubts

[Chorus:]
I hate, when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me...
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me!
