Dawn found me lying on the ground
As soon as the night passed away
And the wind among the trees
Is watching me as a hunted game

I feel cold on the dewy field
Where my mind found me
I fear in the early morning light
That death was banished by

My reflection struggle
Like frightened birds in the silence
While i'm scared looking for
My lost memories

Black veil of the night
Still keeps me confined
When i scream and lift up
My bloody hands to the sky

To redeem has gone the dawn
But inside myself is still raging the night

[Chorus:]
I'm dancing with the devil
By moonlight
In the mask of madness 
Two minutes before midnight
In the world of shades

"my soulles body
Is wandering through the night
And as a humanfaced monster
Is looking for his sacrify"

The everything - devouring, cold darkness
Is surrounding like an icy - ocean my heart

[Chorus:]
I'm dancing with the devil
By moonlight
In the mask of madness 
Two minutes before midnight
In the world of shades
