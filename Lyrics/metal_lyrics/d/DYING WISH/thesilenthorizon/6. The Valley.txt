The valley where i can feel the infinite
Cold touch of time forever
The valley which leans over me to defend
And i lived there as a slave

She became my mother and father
And the only one who really knows me
And when i close my eyes forever
She will known why i do it

The valley where the sky is far-away
I sometimes leave for her on a path
But flow is coming and sweeping away
"don't run away" - whispers the wind

The valley only can hear my last words
Among the flowers fed with loneliness

[Chorus:]
The valley where in my own world
I live alone

Now i say goodbye, i'm waited in the sky
The valley will tell that she was the only with me

[Chorus:]
The valley where in my own world
I live alone

Nobody can see my smile
Nobody can see my tears
