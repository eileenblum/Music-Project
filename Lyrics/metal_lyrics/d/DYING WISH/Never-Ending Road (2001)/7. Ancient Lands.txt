Cold silence of never-ending space
Green distance of mountains
Steps into the unknown
Dark depth oceans
Old sanctuary of mother earth
I'm looking for the land of miracles
Cradle of every secret
Eternal peace of paradise
Where memories never die
The wind dancing on the trees
Heavenly music of wanderers
I'm looking for the land of miracles
The road that nobody has walked on
The land that nodody has seen
T'm taken away by the endless horizon
The gates are open and in a glance
And the secrets of the past are closed in this land

Ancient signs
Forgotten ages
A silent idol
Fight and tears
Sorrow and hope
Fables written in blood
Purplse shine of sunset
A star on the black sky
Show me the way
I'm looking for the land of miracles
