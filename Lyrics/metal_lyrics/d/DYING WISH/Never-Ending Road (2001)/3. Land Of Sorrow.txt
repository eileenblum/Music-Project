A cruel place, watered with my blood
A terrile vision I see in my dream
The sky in the net of evil eyes
Spreads its embodied rage over me
A silent scream from the deep
Of my mind, throws the gates open...

Welcome to the land of sorrow
Where your hope will be destroyed
Your fate is written in blood

I set out on the river of souls
A burnt raft on the night rivers
The sorrowful voice of the riverside trees:
The roaring wind, the anger of gods
A silent scream from the deep
Of my mind, throws the gates open...

Welcome to the land of sorrow
Where your hope will be destroyed
Your fate is written in blood

The darkness hides the agonising voices of my soul
On the edge of the outside world
Long years under the black sun
A thousand years of pain is the eternal remorse
My life is the gift of death,
A velvet veil over my face...
