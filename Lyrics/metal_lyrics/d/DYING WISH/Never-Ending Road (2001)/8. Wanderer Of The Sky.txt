It brought us the sign, death and torture
Waking up te sleeping fire of our fears
Or the hope that was waiting for the divine sign
Shaking and bried deep.
Lights makes your silver eyes blind,
But in the night you will see again.
Immortal wanderer of the sky,
The Earth is just a grain of sand on your infinite way

It will send us to the depths of Hell
On black horses of dark angels
Or it will take us to the garden of Eden
Where our sins will be forgiven.
Light makes your silver eyes blind,
But in the night you will see again.
Immortal wanderer of the sky,
The Eatrh is just a grain of sand on your infinite way.

It's chaos in my faith
The spark of doubt
It came with a thousand questions,
But didn't give me an answer.
It's chaos in my heart
Reality suffocates me,
It's the deadly embrace
Of this untrue world.
Why don't I understand it?
Why can't I feel it, either?
If you're here in my soul.
If you're here in my mind.
Give me strength or take everything.
'Cause your dumbness confuses me.
