What's the reason for our birth,and death.
Why is there love?
And why is there hate?
Have I a place on Earth?
Or is life only a dream.

Wake me up
My soul wanna' belive
Where's the peace
If wars still rage
What is life worth

If there areno dreams for a lond time
The past, the future
Have alreadyintertwined
In your heart, in your soul
You don't know the answer on your own

I live in mistery

Why is there a god?
And why is there evil?
Why is there Earth?
And why is there space?
The light place of secrets
Is still living in us
Wake me up
My soul wanna' belive
