I feel the light is calling me
Slowly I leave my body
The power Thrills me
A kind of dark tunnel
At the and of the way, the light's waiting for me
I would stay with it
But my time hasn't come yet

Everything has changed
Life has a newmearning
I don't haveto fear anymore
At the and of the way, the light's waiting for me
I would stay with it
But my time hasn't come yet

I will wait for it's
Calling again forever
Want's me back
It holds me in it's hight hand tight
I feel wanna' go again
