Signs from the past, watching eyes
From an intime age
The door to the unknown is opened
For a long time

There's only a step
Where the knowledge of thousand of years
And dying stones' sound are
Your soul is waiting silent

Signs from the past
They're lying in front of us, but the truth distruls
Signs from the past
A message that we have never understood
Signs from the past
An ancient, an ancient sound from the last world

Signs from the past
Another hundred of years is flying away
The past remains a white stain
This way leads to the oblivion
