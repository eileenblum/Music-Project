Being submerged under the dreams
In an other dimension
The time loses it's essence
The mind's flying free

The memories that have been
Living in the deep
Now they're rising to the surface
The sounds are embracing me
They're calling me before the white light

The other side is summoning me 
Its door is open
The world of eternity is waiting for me
The other side is summoning me
An other beautiful world 
Unknown but known

You're stepped out of the present
Your soul's having a rest
This strange calmness 
Goes with you on your way

Beyond the light in a higher level
You will give your pasts over again
Your faults,your virtues
Will help you to chose
