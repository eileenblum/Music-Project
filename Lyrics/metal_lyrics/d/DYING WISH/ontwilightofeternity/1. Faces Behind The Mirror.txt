I'm down, he is watching me from above
My dream is burning, i dream forever
Keep my life, give me air
I try to think better and better

Solitude has disappeared
Harmony can it be reached?
Misery, don't stay with me
Le't me have a rest, let me be!

Lonliness and destiny
Let me have a rest, let me be!
Broken candles, long slumber
Look at the faces behind the mirror

Into this silent world
Loud cry is heard
My voices and reflections
Are strange and immortal
Mother earth life - giving power
Show me, show me the way
Deep down the dark world
Cross and some flovers show.
