I only can see its face
It hurts and hurts forever
I'm lying in the dept of existence
There only walls around me
It hurts again,i cant feel my body
It was colourful world,
But my memories are getting faded,
Time makes things more pleasent,
My dreams last till day-time
I can see never more
The painful pictures are swallowed
Up by the past. 

Faces and pictures live on the beyond
They sometimes touch me
The eyes are too blue behind the faces
They'll return to the mirror.

It's tormenting me smiling in my dreams
I can hear it's steps when i'm awake too
The present has faded
And the past has got clean
I can see never more 
The painful pictures are swallowed
Up by the past
