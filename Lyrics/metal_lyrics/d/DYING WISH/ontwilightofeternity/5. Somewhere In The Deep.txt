The magic has gone 
Everything's like chaos 
The voice is strange 
The touch's cold. 
The night is colourful 
Every sound of it makes me shudder 
Attack me from the darkness 
Breathes its frosty breath to me. 

Somewhere in the deep - 
You'll find me if you need me 
You see, i needn't fear 
The natural beauty casts a spell upon me 
Somewhere in the deep - 
From below everything's cleaner. 
Don't disturb my dream - 
I'm defendin' the secret of the world.

You can see a dream 
Shades in the fire 
Shade of a raven 
As i returned. 
My body belongs to the decay 
Someone above is watchin' me 
The sky's silent and feels blue 
The wind dries it's tears.
