I walked on dusty roads 
On burning lands 
The wind picked up my sigh 
The dust swallowed up my steps 
Dark changed the light 
The sky wasn't blue longer 
Crying trees bended 
Down over dryed rivers

Fire burned in the night 
I fell down tired beside it 
The fear spoke from the eyes 
Behind the flames 
I wait for the vultures 
I watch them in silence 
As their evil eyes 
Are burning into my soul 

I let the dream takes me away 
Pulls me deeper and deeper 
To our future 
Painted with brush of madness 

When the last leaf 
Fell into oblivion 
And the rain slowly 
Carried away everything 
While the wind is crying 
The cold white dressed 
Infinite night tells about 
Frozen dreams
