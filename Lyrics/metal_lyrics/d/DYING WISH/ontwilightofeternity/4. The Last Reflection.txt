Time is riding with me 
Like a long shade
My past is following me
I'm wandering
But my way never ends

Just fading away
The night touches me 
In the silence
It calls my soul
Behind the clouds

Watching your face looking for 
The past listen to the march of time

Floating in the space
In the blinding eternity
I was waiting for a sound
For a forgotten world
But everything is dark

Winter shade gentle breeze
This is the last
The last movement
The night is falling
To the velvet ground
This is the last
The last reflection
