Felling sick and weak inside
Lost all hope and my pride
Something's gone wrong with me
Diseased body, what can this be?
She turned me on to her fate
Now i lie here losing weight
I was home and being bored
She's one chick i shouldn't have scored

Labeled uncurable [2]

Can't take this agony
Unstable mantality
Insanity is setting in
I'll take my life if i can
My family's all disowned me
Untolerated by society
I wish i could just go home
But I'm stuck here to die alone

Labeled uncurable [4]

Felling sick and weak inside
I lost all hope and my pride
I was home and being bored
She's one chick I shouln't have scored
Nothing to do but wait
Sit around filled with hate
I can't take this agony
Labeled uncurable
