Standing in line
For something to eat
Dragging my ass
Dead on my feet
No more possessions
Just my clothes
Down on my luck
And I'm sure it shows

No confidence
No self-esteem
When I lost my love
I lost my dream
Aching heart
Head and soul
Sleepless nights
Are taking their toll

Back to the hotel
On welfare street
A beer, then bed
'Cause I'm so beat
Walk down the hall
Just to take a piss
Never thought I'd
End up like this

The obvious conclusion
The inevitable end
Death will be welcomed
Like a friend
