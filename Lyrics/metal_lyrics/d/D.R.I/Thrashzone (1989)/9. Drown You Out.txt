We've waited with patience
For acceptance
Into your lame-o stations
You've left us no choice
Because you won't let us
Voice our opinions

We've got to drown you out
Drown you out [2]

When commercial sponsors
Decide what we hear
Something's wrong
How much money would they lose
If they decided
To choose our song?

We've got to drown you out
Drown you out [2]

We've waited with patience
For acceptance
Into your lame-o stations
You've left us no choice
And we have got to
Voice our opinions
