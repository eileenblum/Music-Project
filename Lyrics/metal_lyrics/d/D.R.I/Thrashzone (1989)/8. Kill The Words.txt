Kill the author
Of the best seller
Place a bounty
Upon his head
Kill writer
Of opposition
Tell the squad
I want that man dead

I want him dead [2]

Kill free speech
As an example
Hang the corpse
For all to see
Kill all hope
Of restitution
And all
Who dare oppose me

Kill the words [2]

Infidels, pagans and traitors
Allah damns you for your blasphemy
Your Satanic Verses
Have earned you a death sentence
I am sworn to kill all
Who may disagree

All of you heathens
And unbelievers
I won't even give you
A chance to fight
I've got my men out there
Waiting and stationed
Ready to strike
When the time is right

Burn the stores
That serve as outlets
They are all
My enemy

Kill all means
Of distribution
That make possible
All their heresy

Kill the words [2]
