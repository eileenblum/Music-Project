Mommy, Daddy
Help me please
I beg of you
I'm on my knees
Save me from
This Life I Lead
The pain, the blood
The agony
I want to stop

Somehow I can't
The time draws near
I start to pant
Once again
I put it off
I swallow hard
And Then I cough

[CHORUS]

Enemy
Whith in my head
I often wish
That i was dead
No self control
Of my own mind
Got to stop
There's no more time

I've got to try
I must release
Rid my soul
From this beast
It's my lst chance
I must prevail
Cast put the enemy
I musn't fail

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Enemy
Whith in my head
I often wish
That i was dead
No self control
Of my own mind
Got to stop
There's no more time
