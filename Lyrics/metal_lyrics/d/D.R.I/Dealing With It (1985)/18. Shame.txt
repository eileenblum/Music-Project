No blacks, no whites, no Ku Klux Klan
Orientals, Mexicans
No guns, no bombs, national front
No greed, no hate, no government
No smog, no filth, no factories
No more cities to keep clean
No locks, no gates, no property
No states and no boundaries
No trends, no fads, no macho man
Stupid, idiot, cock-rock bands
No cops, no crimes, no jealousy
No laws, creeds, no one to please
I'm ashamed to be a human being
I'm ashamed to be a human being
Cause we've got the brains to stop all war
But we're rotten to the core
