He's old and cranky and he's got white hair
He yells at us in his underwear
He'll attach you like a crazed bear
But come on in, don't be scared
Mad man, he'll kick down the door
Mad man, he'll call you a whore
Mad man, he'll brand you a slut
Mad man, he'll kick your butt!
You pay the bills, I live in your place
I'll do what you say for my dwelling space
I'll do your dishes, I'll wash the floor
Just please don't kick down our jam room door
Mad man, he'll kick down the door
Mad man, he'll call you a whore
Mad man, he'll brand you a slut
Mad man, he'll kick your butt!
You hit my friends and cut down blacks
Proves again what your mind lacks
You back the klan
I've got to
Change my nazi dad
Change my nazi dad
Change my nazi
