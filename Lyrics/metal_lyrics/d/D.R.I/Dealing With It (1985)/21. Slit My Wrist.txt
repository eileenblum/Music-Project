Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist, slit my wrist
I hate to care, I hate relations
A pile stacked high of complications
Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist, slit my wrist
I hate the thought that I must give
All my time just to live
Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist, slit my wrist
I hate the thought of government aid
Across my wrist, a razor blade
Every day I get more pissed
Slit my wrist, slit my wrist
