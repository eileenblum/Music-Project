Argument then war
Even the score
Retaliate, revenge
The will to win
Man can't be wrong
Man can never get along
Man wants to fight
Man wants to be right
Man wants to kill
Man will
Argument then war
Even the score
Retaliate, revenge
The will to win
Man can't be wrong
Man can never get along
Man lives in the past
Civilized trash
Man hates himself
Poisons himself
He is his own disease
Committing slow suicide
