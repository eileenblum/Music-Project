I am an old man living alone
My loved ones stuck me here in this nursing home
I've lost all usefulness
I want to die
I have them all the best years of my life
Then Maggie passed away, now I've got no wife
So kill me, young man, or hand me your knife
I want to die
My beautiful daughter says I get in the way
I depress her because I'm old and grey
She can't stand to see the wrinkles in my skin
By golly, girl, you're my only kin
I want to die
Like an old horse put out to pasture
Too old to be of any more use to it's master
But when I lie in bed and I reminisce
I begin to think maybe this is best
I'm out of the way, not in anyone's hair
And though I'm costing them money, I don't care
I want to die
