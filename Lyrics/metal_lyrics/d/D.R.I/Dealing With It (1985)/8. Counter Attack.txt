Counter attack! Counter attack!
We've his underground long enough
They've got power, but not enough
Time to start, time to act
They've got our lives
They've got us trapped
Stab the system in the back
Face your fears, face the facts
Time to start, time to act
Time to show them that we care
Time to show that we're not scared
Time to show them how to share their money
Counter attack! Counter attack!
