Beginning with its conclusion
Misdirected by what's right
Actual illusion
Weakened by its might
The deserving marital value
Priced for quick exchange
Is worth in the open market
Only half its weight in change
Enthusiastically disfigured
By anticipated, sterile waste
Poised and promising
Glazed in its loss of face
Frantically mellow
Blameless in its intent
More solid than jello
Yet, softer than cement
Unprofitably productive
Not worth speaking of
Mutually destructive
None of the above
