Salvation's around the corner
Just dig into your soul
Donations for the holy word
A paycheck for god's goal
His iron-handed, spiritual rule
Is that what you fear most?
God is green, a numbered face
A scamming holy ghost!
God is broke,
The well ran dry
So pay up while you can
Or you'll end up in hell
Money in the box is like
A halo on your head
But all of Christ's love
Still leaves him with the dead
