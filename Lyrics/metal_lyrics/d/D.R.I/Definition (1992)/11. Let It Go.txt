Let it go! let it go!
Let it go! let it go!
Leave it alone, let it go.
Learn when to shut your mouth
Leave it alone, you gotta know.
When to just let it go.
I hope for the best, but i expect the worst
I'm a realist at heart, searching for treasure
Buried wherever, no hints and no chart
Screaming and loving, pushing and tugging
What is right and what's wrong? in my wildest dreams
I never imagined it would last this long
I was counting the days, now i'm counting the months
When will this all end? could be a year
Could be never, or just around the bend
I know it's hard to show you care
Like spin the bottle, it's truth or dare
Opposing sides from your position
Don't' give a fuck, that's my decision
You are so unkind, that look on your face
Hey, i'm not afraid to roll the dice
I've made mistakes before, but i've served my time
At least i've got my memories, i'll put aside my losses
And show you how to win the game
Leave it alone, let it go.
Learn when to shut your mouth
Leave it alone, you gotta know.
When to just let it go.
