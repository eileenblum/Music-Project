My body is stupid
But my brain is smart
Luck rules both of them
With the help of my heart
Like a stumbling moron
Unable to obey
The simplest laws
Of morality
I'm the saddest excuse
For a human being
Wish my past was slate
Which I could wipe clean
But who can I blame?
There's only me
I screwed up
I'm guilty
Guilt trip
The guilt trip
Guilt trip
I'm on a trip to the land of guilt
I've been here since the house of pain was built
The price is high, but when I need relief
I'll pay the price, when I feel the grief
