Go ahead and say it! what have you got to lose?
Go ahead and say it! no need to hold back
Go ahead and say it! voice your opinion
Go ahead and say it! while you still have the right
Why keep it all bottled up inside?
Say it loud and at least you've tried
Someone hears and you're on your way
Something on your mind you have to say
Say it! go ahead and say it!
Shout and let it out
Go ahead and say it! say it!
Go ahead and say it! don't care what others think
Go ahead and say it! let your thoughts be known
Go ahead and say it! voice your opinion
Go ahead and say it! while you still have the right
Living your life like you're satisfied
Hold your tongue and you swallow your pride
Peaceful and golden as silence may be
There are some thoughts you've just got to set free
So say it!
Go ahead and say it! the time is right for change
Go ahead and say it! you can make a difference
Go ahead and say it! voice your opinion
Go ahead and say it! while you still have the right
