You don't know who i am
You don't know what i want
You can't see in my head
You can't even imagine
You don't know what i'm feeling
You don't know what i'm like
You don't know what i'm dreaming
In the middle of the night
So please, please don't ask [x2]
You don't know how i work
You don't know what makes me tick
You can't tell if i'm healthy
Or if my mind is sick
You don't know how i am
You don't even want to know
You can't know what i'm thinking
You don't even want to know
So please, please don't ask [x2]
You don't know how i work
You don't know what makes me tick
You can't tell if i'm healthy
Or if my mind is sick
You don't know how i am
You don't even want to know
You can't know what i'm thinking
You don't even want to know
So please, please don't ask [x2]
