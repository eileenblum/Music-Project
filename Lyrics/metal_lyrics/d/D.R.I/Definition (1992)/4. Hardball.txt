Out of the woodwork
Here you come, crawling
On your knees, hands out
I think you missed your calling
You want a percentage
Imaginary piece of the pie
Take a number, get in line
Asshole - nice try
Cause we're playing hard ball
Now we're playing hard ball
You threaten lawyers
Go ahead and call
Sounds like fun

Cause we're playing hard ball
Now we're playing hard ball [X2]
Now we're playing, now we're playing hard ball [X2]

You want to play with us
Well step up to the plate
The bases are loaded
And we tire of the wait
I'd love to go to court
Just to see you fail
And end your pathetic attempt
At extortion and blackmail
