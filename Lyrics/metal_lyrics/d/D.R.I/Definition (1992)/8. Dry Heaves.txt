I was drinking beer, then i was drinking jager
I know i shouldn't mix the two, i always pay later
But that's just beside the point, what is done is done
Now i'm hurting real bad and i've got the runs
I hate the dry heaves, i hate dry heaves
I hate the dry heaves, i hate dry heaves
I was talking to you then i was on the ground
When i shut my eyes, everything spun around
When i'm so fucked up, i forget where i am
I feel so bad, i puked in your van
Gut-wrenching spasms that just won't stop
Trying to squeeze out just one last drop
My gut tied in knots, nothing left inside
Thank you so much for giving me a ride
I hate the dry heaves, i hate dry heaves
I hate the dry heaves, i hate dry heaves
