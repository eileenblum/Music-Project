Today i want to be with you for the rest of my life
Tomorrow i may never want to see you again
That's how it goes, people change
But you know that i don't have to tell you
I think about you all the time
I think about you all the time
I never wanted this, i was having fun
Before i met you, falling for anyone
Was not on my agenda, but it still happened, now
I think about you all the time
I think about you all the time
I don't' have to tell you, you know that
I think about you all the time
I think about you all the time
Tomorrow - before i met you
Falling - not on my agenda
People change - it still happened
Thinking about you for the rest of my life
