I love life but I don't think life loves me
I'll recreate my own reality
The teachers and the preachers, they all lied to me
There's no end to what a kid will believe
You don't know what's going on
You believe what you've been told
You don't know what's up
You believe what you've been told
Columbus didn't discover america
Jesus wasn't the only son of god
If he even was the son at all
If there even is a god at all
Man on the platform builds a funeral pyre
Sign on the post says, "today we burn the liar"
Unbelievable nightmare, my body's on fire
Wish I could just wake up, flames around me growing higher

[Lyrics: brecht]
