When it comes down to the wire
No one will help, every man for himself
When it comes down t the wire
You have to do what you can for yourself
There's a contract out on me
Now there's no safe place to be
I'm on the run all day and night
Laying low, staying out of sight
I'm not sure if I can take it
I don't know if I can make it
All the money in the world
Can't buy a true friend
When it comes down, down to the wire
When it comes down, down to the wire
I'm so tired, but I don't dare go to sleep
How did I get in so deep?
I learned something that I'd rather not know
Maybe I could make it down to mexico
I know way more than I'd like to admit
And they know I know, that's why the hit
It's the not knowing when that I really dread
They'll be after me until I'm dead
When it comes down to the wire
No one will help, every man for himself
When it comes down t the wire
You have to do what you can for yourself
Can't go to work, I can't go home
Gotta face it, I'm alone
Hiding behind every bush and tree
May be someone waiting for me
It could be someone that I know
Can't think of a worse way to go
Could even be a good friend they hire
When it comes down to the wire
When it comes down, down to the wire
When it comes down, down to the wire
