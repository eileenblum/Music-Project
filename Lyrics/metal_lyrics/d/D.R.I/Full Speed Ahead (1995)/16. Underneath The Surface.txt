I can't tell you anything you don't already know
And I'm really not the type to say, "I told you so."
But accidents can always happen, death is always near
So if you drive to hell and back, don't let the devil steer
You may think it's strange that you are living your own death
So before you go under, you'd better take a deep breath
You can only have on shot at life, don't swing and miss
Don't put too much trust in anyone, and remember this
Underneath the surface, it's much worse than it seems
And I can tell you, brother, life ain't just a dream
Underneath the surface, you won't have much to say
And I can tell you, brother, it's cold inside your grave
I could tell you all exactly what you want to hear
You're all gonna live forever, nothing more to fear
But I don't want to live forever, i'll leave that to you
I just want to live until there's nothing else to do
Underneath the surface, buried for eternity
And I hate to think about just how long that could be
Underneath the surface, planted, but you will not grow
No roots, no leaves, no seeds of life. Guess that just goes to show
Underneath the surface, it's much worse than it seems
And I can tell you, brother, life ain't just a dream
Underneath the surface, you won't have much to say
And I can tell you, brother, it's cold inside your grave
Everything you really need is right in front of you
Take a big bite out of life, but don't forget to chew
You can only have one shot at life, don't swing and miss
Don't put too much trust in anyone, and remember this
Underneath the surface, we all go insane
