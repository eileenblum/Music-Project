Come apart under stress
Opened up, I won't confess
Pulled apart, they're four of me
Opened up, an oddity
Changing with the times
Like rolling with the punches
Basing my decisions
On theories and hunches
All I ever wanted to do
Was move forward
Being pulled
Four directions at once
Drawn and quartered
Come apart at the seams
Opened up for all to see
Coming apart, but I don't cry
Opened up, but I won't bleed
I won't, I won't bleed for
I won't, I won't bleed for you
I won't let you see
What's really inside me
Hidden somewhere in between
Buried beneath the skin and bone
Away rom the smiles which are lies
Ripped apart, I just laugh
Opened up, can't help but laugh
Torn open, an open book
Opened up, please don't look
I won't let you see
What's really inside me
Hidden somewhere in between
Buried beneath the skin and bone
Away rom the smiles which are lies
Please don't, please don't look at
Please don't, please don't look at me
