I don't trust that girl with a gun
Something about a girl with a gun
The way they fly off the handle
Someone's gonna get hurt
She's gonna hurt someone
That girl's got a gun
She's got a 28
She's got a 38
She's got a 357 magnum
She sleeps with one stashed in her bed
And she's packing one in her purse
I was thinking yesterday
I don't know which one is worse
She's gonna hurt someone
That girl's got a gun
She's got a 28
She's got a 38
She's got a 357 magnum
My god, girl, where have you been?
And where will you be tomorrow?
I see you smothered in your sin
And surrounded by your sorrow
She's gonna hurt someone
That girl's got a gun
Girl with a gun, girl with a gun
Girl with a gun, girl with a gun
