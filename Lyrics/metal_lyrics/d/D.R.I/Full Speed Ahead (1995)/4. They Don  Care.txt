I got a letter in the mail just the other day
Opened it up, this is what it had to say:
"Wouldn't you please give us the pleasure
Of having you at our table tonite?
From, the donner family"
We've been hungry for such a long time
And we've eaten our dogs and rawhide
We've got half of our family on ice
They would not want the rest of us to die
They would not want the rest of us to die
They don't care
They would not have us starve to death
We're so cold
We're freezing and there's nothing left
They don't care
I'm sure that they wouldn't mind
It's so bad
Half of us are snow blind
It's too late now, we can never go back
We can make up for the protein we lack
Four days of no food have left us all weak
I feel like I can't stand on my own two feet
My own two feet, my own two feet
We've been waiting for such a long time
For some word of help or some sign
That someone's coming to our rescue
Until then, we'll do what we have to
Until then, we'll do what we have to
They don't care
They would not have us die this way
It's like this
We have to find some food today
They don't care
They knew what we were going through
They don't care
This is what it's come to
We never felt like we could really do it
Now weare just thankful we all lived through it
We ate those people because we were hungry
Yeah, we're survivors of the donner family
The donner family
We've been hungry for such a long, long time
And we've eaten our dogs and rawhide
We've got half of our family on ice
They would not want the rest of us to die
They would not want the rest of us to die
They don't care
They would not have us starve to death
We're so cold
We're freezing and there's nothing left
They don't care
I'm sure that they wouldn't mind
It's so bad
Half of us are snow blind
I got a letter in the mail just the other day
Opened it up, this is what it had to say:
"wouldn't you please give us the pleasure
Of having you at our table tonite?
From, the donner family"
The donner family
The donner family
