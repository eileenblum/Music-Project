We won't mention names
But why don't you ever shut up?
You're constantly talking
And I just can't keep up

Conversations a joke
Is your head made of oak?
Endlessly blabbing
But sometimes it feels like you're stabbing

Shut up [x2], shut the fuck up

Bragging and lying
So you won't have to stop
I've got to get out
My head's about to pop

You know who you are
C'mon give me a break
You go on and on
Until I feel faint

Shut up [x2] what are you deaf?
Shut up
