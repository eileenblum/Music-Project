I call you up
You've got nothing to say
I get the hint
And I'm blown away

Been gone, gone too long
I've been gone too long [x2]

You must see me
In some far away city
Wonder, is she blond
And is she pretty

When I'm gone so long
Our bonds grow week
Trust gone sour
Cause we can't speak

Been gone, gone too long
I've been gone too long [x2]

I wake up at night
Drenched in sweat
Another nightmare
I can't forget

Drinking and thinking
About what could have been
Smoking and trying to
Live with my sin

Been gone, gone too long
I've been gone too long [x2]
