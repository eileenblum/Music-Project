Conform - It's only need
Distort - Not what it seems
Resort - To the deed
Report - To the machine

Modern day vendor that sells you hell
A line is formed, will you live to tell?
Money - machine, become all one
Hand to hand, the damage done

Conform - No not alone
Distort - What's always shown
Resort - The need again
Report - The machine again

Was it over when it started?
Has the warmth since departed?
Did you put your life on hold?
On the shelf while firing the load?
