How can you be
So quick to condemn
By word or rumor
Heard from a friend?

One can't believe
All that one hears
It's your decision
And not your peers

Think for yourself
Don't rely on someone else

How can you say
That I'm that way?
You don't know
Just heard it was so

You're against me
Well, how can that be?
We've never met
Your opinion's been set

Think for yourself
Don't rely on someone else

Inspect each situation
See from both sides
Seek out the truth
Bury the lies

One can't believe
All that one hears
It's your decision
And not your peers

Think for yourself
Don't rely on someone else
