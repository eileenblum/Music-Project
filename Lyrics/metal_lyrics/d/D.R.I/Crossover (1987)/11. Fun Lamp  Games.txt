Step on mine, I'll step on yours
Take what's mine, I'll take what's yours
Bleed on me, I'll spit on you
Inconsideration
Part of the game
Voted rules
Are always changed
Plans are made
But rearranged
And only one thing
Stays the same
Yell at me, I'll yell at you
Push on me, I'll push on you
Fuck with me and I'll screw you
I turn it up, you'll turn it down
I speed up, you'll slow down
And you'll reject what i accept
Inconsideration
Part of the game
Voted rules
Are always changed
Plans are made
But rearranged
And only one thing
Stays the same
You stay healthy, I'll be sick
You dominate, but you've been tricked
Think its' over, it's just begun
To you, a nightmare
To me, it's fun!
