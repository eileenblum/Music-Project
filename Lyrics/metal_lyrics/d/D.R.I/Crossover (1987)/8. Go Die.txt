You're bothering me
For anything free
Why can't you see?

I'm out on a limb
My nerves are stretched thin
You really don't win

Go die!

You seriously ask
For my autograph
I can't help but laugh

Just leave me alone
Why can't you go home
A brain you don't own

Following me around
Just like a lost hound
And you're bringing me down

I tell you goodbye
And you ask me why
Guess I'm just shy

Go die!
