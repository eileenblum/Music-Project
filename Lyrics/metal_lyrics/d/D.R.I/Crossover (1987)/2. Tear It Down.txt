Fighting this society, there's only one way to win
We must stick together through all thick and thin
Cross over the line of your stubborn, closed mind
Don't be surprised at what you might find
Things you thought wrong may have always been right
You'll probably find fault in your reasons to fight
You really don't differ from what i can see
Ain't it time to unite, or is it just me?
Just as we watch them build this empire
So they shall watch us tear it down
If not with our words, then with the power of our sound!
Fighting this society, there's only one way to win
We must stick together through all thick and thin
Cross over the line of your stubborn, closed mind
Don't be surprised at what you might find
We are the future, so let's get things straight
Combine our forces before it's too late
Fighting ourselves can't go on any longer
We must fight together if we want to grow stronger
We can tear it down
We must tear it down
We will tear it down
