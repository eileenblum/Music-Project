I lose, you win
I lose, you win
I lose, you win
I lose again
But you're on my five-year plan
Your time will come
When you least expect it, expect it!
The five-year plan
You fucked me over
You did me wrong
You know why
I wrote this song
The five-year plan
Until the, I'll just pretend
That you are still my friend
But in the end, your time will come
When you least expect it, expect it!
The five-year plan
I don't forget so easily
No, I'm not so quick to forget
The five-year plan
I hold a grudge
I live for revenge
The five-year plan
I win, you lose
I win, you lose
I win!
