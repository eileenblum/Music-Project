Way past overdrive
Full on redline
No easing up
Your life's flying by
Pushing and passing
Yourself you've just passed
First over the finish
You still come in last
Face turning to stone
Your eyes owl-wide
No easing up
More speed is your high
Look and feel
Twice your age
Grinding in your silent rage
Dying at twice the speed
Yet not enough to
Quench your need
Redline, foot to the floor
Redline, slow-paced is a bore
Redline, yourself you've just passed
Redline, you still come in last
