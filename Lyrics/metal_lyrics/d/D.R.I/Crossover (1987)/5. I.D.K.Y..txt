Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Amplified starlight
Pure energy
You cringe from my power
Go home and take a shower
I am intelligent life
You are less

Look into my heart
Tell me what you feel
Pain and agony
&gt;From a horrid ordeal
You flee from my sadness
Finding no gladness
I can handle it o.k.
You really can't

Look into my mind
Tell me what you think
Of the mange and madness
Of a missing link
You stiffen and turn sour
Descending from my tower
You fall and turn away
You are mine!
