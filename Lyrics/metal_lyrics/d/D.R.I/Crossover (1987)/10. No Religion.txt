Won't see me on my knees
Take my soul and save it, please
Ten hail Mary's for my sin
Paying heaven to get in
Got no money for your basket
A million times you can ask it
Find your bible far too odd
Ain't got time for your god
I've made my decision
Don't want your religion
No more church-bound prison
Or jerry falwell television
Don't forget, he's coming back
So put your dollars in the stack
The second coming's getting close
So pay up now and get the most
Form a line for all to pay
And do the same next Sunday
Step right up and clean your soul
Single file, young and old
I've made my decision
Don't want your religion
No more church-bound prison
Or jerry falwell television
Wash your brain, a strange obsession
You're an angel, post confession
Holy book tells right from wrong
