I play Pac-Man and I watch T. V.
I'm so happy 'cause it pleases me
I couldn't really ask for anything else
Maybe my own chain of Taco Bells

I'm perfectly happy right where I am
I could live forever in a traffic jam
It doesn't really bother me to breath the poison air
I'd choke anyway, I don't really care

Sometimes I think about getting away for a while
But when I return I will be out of style
You may say I'm not an ambitious man
But let me tell you I've got some plans
Like there's a new car I wanna buy
And a video cassette recorder yet I'm not sure why
I wanna get married and have three kids
'Cause I'm lonely and I've got the hard dick
Commuter Man
