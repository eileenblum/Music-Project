I stayed at homw today
And I'm not going back to work
Money Stinks... Money Stinks
This city stinks
Smell the power, smell the health
Smell the poverty of Americas wealth
Money smells of evil, greed
Capitolist wants and pumped up needs

Money stinks
Money stinks
This city stinks

Smell the logic... Smell the jet planes
The dangerous goals and crooked aims
Smell the progress... Smell the dirty money
Smells like shit, this isn't funny

Money stinks
Money stinks
This city stinks

Nobody cares about the air we breath
Nobody cares about the air we need
Smell the profit, smell the success
Smell the dying dream of the mighty west
Smell the factories, smell all the cars
The adult book stores and the topless bars
Smell the pretty people, smell their false pity
Smell the broken promise of the living city
Smell the real reason, smell, smell the one way plan
The real estate, the desperate, state of modern man
Smell the excess, smell the death
Smell the wet dream of this human mess
