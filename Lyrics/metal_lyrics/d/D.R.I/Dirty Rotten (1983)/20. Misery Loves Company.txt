What they have now
They want for me
Misery loves company
Live a life of bigotry
On the way to bankruptcy
Beer belly and family
Crackers, cheese and burgundy

You're life's no anomaly
Live your life accordingly
Wake up to the certainty
Of ageing and misery

No real love just cake and tea
No road to recovery
Live the life of drudgery
Same old shit, housewivery, fakery, tracery, misery
