The generals say they make good sense
A strong economy? First a strong defence

That makes sense
They make sense to me

The Air force says they need new planes
As they prepare for strafing raids
And the Army, of course, needs more men
So they can fight and kill and win

That makes sense
They make sense to me

The Navy says they need more ships
So they can float and shoot and shit
They also say they need machines
To run they're little submarines

That makes sense
They make sense to me
