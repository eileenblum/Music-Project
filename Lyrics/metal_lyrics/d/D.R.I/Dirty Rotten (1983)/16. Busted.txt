Police drive by, I hold my breath
I've got 10 warrants for my arrest
They stop at the light and whip it around
Ten minutes later I'm headed downtown
Free Ride

Busted... stepped out of line
Busted... no place to hide
Busted... couldn't pay my fines

It makes no sense to live this way
But I'm gonna do it anyway

Busted... for being me
Busted... for being free
Busted... can't pay my bail
Busted... I'll die in jail

It makes no sense to live this way
But I'm gonna do it anyway
