My moms upset, my dads uptight
Don't like my music, they say it isn't right
Don't like my haircut, they call me a dyke
They send me to a shrink twice a week
He tells my mom I'm a fucking freak
Dreaming scary dreams
Wondering what they mean
Living down under deep in never ending waking sleep
When will this end?
Or has it even begun
I love the moon
And I hate the sun
