My mommy says I should join the church
The mad man tells me what I'm worth
True, it's clear, he beats me down
Makes me bitter, makes me frown
Till I myself as a human being
Hide my eyes to what I see
I myself as a human being
Hide my eyes to reality

Me, alone, I really wonder why
All alone I wonder why I try
When life itself depresses me
And everything else, it's sad to be
