Beyond the Gates of Hell
Between death and life
There's a road few have travelled
A road few survive

Watch out! Beware!
Prepare to run with your life
Watch out! Out there!
For the fool who takes
A look in his eyes
Will be lost to the Master of Time
We're searching for souls
Everyone must be saved

Beyond the Gates of Hell
Between death and life
There's a road few have travelled
A road few survive

Hold on to the light!
There's no way of turning back now
It's not real what you see
It's just a state of your mind
That he holds
They're trying to work it through you
But the time's running out
There's nothing more you can do

Beyond the Gates of Hell
Between death and life
There's a road few have travelled
A road few survive

They're searching for souls
Everyone must be saved
But the time's running out
There's nothing left you can do
