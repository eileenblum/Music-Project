Have we been here before
We all shine on. Shine on

I believe after life the spirit lives on
It's a journey without end
Whatever's precious to you now
Will it stand, stand the test of time?
And all those faces in the crowd
Seem so familiar to you now
And though I've never walked this street before
Somehow I feel, I feel I know it so well

Have we been here before?
We all shine on
Have we been here before?
We all shine on. Shine on

We move between two points in time
And question existence of if all
Is it fact or is it fantasy?
What lies in wait, waiting for us all
And when we leave, will we return again
Only to wear a new disguise?
And while this world, it keeps on turning
Will there be a place where both become one?

Have we been here before?
We all shine on
Have we been here before?
We all shine on

We exist beyond reason
No explanation for it all
We've been searching tor it everywhere
We've done it all before.

Have we been here before?
We all shine on
Have we been here before?
We all shine on

And all those faces in the crowd
Seem so familiar to me now
And though I've never walked this street before
Somehow I feel, I feel I know it so well

Have we been here before?
We all shine on
Have we been here before?
We all shine on and on
Have we been here before?
We all shine one
Have we been here before?
We all shine on and on.
