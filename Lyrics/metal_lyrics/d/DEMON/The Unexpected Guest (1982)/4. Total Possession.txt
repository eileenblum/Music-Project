Total possession. I think he's possessed
Total possession.

Don't say a word, best left to himself now
This needs a man of the cloth
Heard him speaking in tongues not of this world
Can't bear to look at him now
It seems a change came overnight
One moment a man, in madness and rage
Became total possession

Total possession. I think he's possessed
A fire in his eyes tell you
He's not like the rest
Total possession. He's out on his own
A crazed look of an insane man.

A twisted face, a tormented victim
Someone's moving upstairs
A life leaks away under the shadows
There's no hope for him now
A tortured soul lies bleeding
Oh Father in Heaven where are you now?
It's total possession

Total possession. I think he's possessed
A fire in his eyes tell you
He's not like the rest
Total possession. He's out on his own
A crazed look of an insane man.
In his own world

It seems a change came overnight
One moment a man, in madness and rage
Became total possession

Total possession. I think he's possessed
A fire in his eyes tell you
He's not like the rest
Total possession. He's out on his own
A crazed look of an insane man.
In his own world
