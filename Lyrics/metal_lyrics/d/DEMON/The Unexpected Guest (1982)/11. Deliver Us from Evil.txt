Now the spell has been cast
The curse has left its mark
And we await the judgment to be passed
While we look upon each other
The sinner and the saint
The final curtain falls upon our kind

It's too late to pray
For the victims left outside the gates of Hell
What fate awaits them now no-one can tell

Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter from it
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter

As we reach the final chapter
And turn another page
Do we see the writing on the wall?
Is it better to have witnessed this
Or never seen at all
What lies behind the shadow of the night?
You've seen the sign
You're forever on the run from your last rights
You live in fear of the unexpected guest

Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter from it
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter

Deliver us â we don't want to go down there
Deliver us â we don't want to go down there

Now the spell has been cast
The curse has left its mark
And we await the judgement to be passed
While we look upon each other
The sinner and the saint
The final curtain falls upon our kind.

It's too late to pray
For the victims left outside the gates of Hell
What fate awaits them now no-one can tell

Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter from it
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter
Deliver us from evil, gimme shelter
