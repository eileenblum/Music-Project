Take a last shot at the sunrise
See the wheel of fire turn round
There's a thirst that burns within you
A need for something strong
Taking you on your wildest dreams
Leave it all behind
Escaping once more to that twilight time
For the hour has come
No place to run
I'll be there when you crash down

It's all the work of the devil
Now you will serve him well
All your lies and false excuses
You've got it off so well

Can you feel your blood run colder
As your senses start to rise
The D.T.'s taking over you
Joker dances in your eyes
The feeling that you're feeling now
Leaves you with no choice
To take life from the bottle
The grand illusion
Your one-man show
Is going down real well

It's all the work of the devil
Now you will serve him well
All the lies and false excuses
You've got it off so well
It's all the work of the devil
To stand another round
When the morning hits you
Like a thief you'll run to ground

Take a last shot at the sunrise
See the wheel of fire turn round
There's a thirst that burns within you
A need for something strong
Taking you on your wildest dreams
Leave it all behind
Escaping once more to that twilight time
For the hour has come
No place to run
I'll be there when you crash down

It's all the work of the devil
Now he will serve you well
All the lies and false excuses
You've got if off so well
It's all the work of the devil
To stand another round
When the morning hits you
Like a thief you'll run to ground.
