Somewhere inside a raging storm
Is waiting to be free
The balance hangs on one slim thread
A twisted nerve could blow it
All around the heat is on
Confusion. Confusion
A finger hitches on a trigger
Another mark of the gun

It's a sign of a madman
Losing his control
It's a sign of a madman
Losing everything

An insane act where genius reigned
The traitor came to light
He swore you were the chosen one
Who'd come to take his place
Now it seems you're showing signs
Of stress. Distress
The sentence passed upon yourself
There's no way out of here

It's a sign of a madman
Losing his control
It's a sign of a madman
Losing everything

How does it feel to be alone in there
How does it feel to be alone in there
Nothing is real now you're alone in there
Nothing is real now you're alone in there

You're all alone in a crowded room
Surrounded by your fate
In the grip of all your plans
You didn't even know it
Now the shadows hide the one
Who lies in wait
Looking for a place in history
How many more like you?

It's a sign of a madman
Losing his control
It's a sign of a madman
Losing everything
It's a sign of a madman
Losing his control
It's a sign of a madman
Losing everything
