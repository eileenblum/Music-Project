He stares alone at the night
No emotion shown
A glimmer of light
Now and then
Communication is broken down
Contact is lost
Just a machine between him
And his maker

It's a strange institution they call life
A nowhere existence, but who's right?
They gave you a mountain to climb
But left you no will to survive

It hurts to see him now
The way he is
Just a shadow of a man
That I once knew
A restless spirit running wild
Hey you! Hey you always laughed
In the face of disaster

It's a strange institution, they call life
A nowhere existence, but who's right?
They gave you a mountain to climb
They left you no will to survive

There's just a machine between him
And his maker
