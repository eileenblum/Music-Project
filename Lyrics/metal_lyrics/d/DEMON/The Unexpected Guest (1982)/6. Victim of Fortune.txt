Victim of fortune
Servant of fate
The force that surrounds you
There's no escape

We can't control the will of destiny
Or the course of the stars
Still we journey for the secret of life
To find who we are meant to be
Is this meant to be?
In the end our beginnings we'll see

Victim of fortune
Servant of fate
The force that surrounds you
There's no escape

Too many things can't be explained
How they came to be
With all your cards and crystal prophecies
Can we really see a way
A solution for us all?
Or are we lost forever, always to fall?

Victim of fortune
Servant of fate
The force that surrounds you
There's no escape

There's a gap in the curtain
Through which some people might see
Of that I am certain
The power of predictions
Through visions we're able to see

Meant to be
Is this meant to be?
In the end our beginnings we'll see

Victim of fortune
Servant of fate
The force that surrounds you
There's no escape
You're a victim
