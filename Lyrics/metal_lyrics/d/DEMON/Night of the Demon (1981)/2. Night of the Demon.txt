There's a scream in the night
There's death on the wind
And a heartbeat that's pounding like rain
There's a flash in the sky
A cry of a hound
As if someone is wailing the dead

And the nightmare begins as the Devil rides out
From the heat through the gates of Hell
And there's no escape from the curse of the damned
You better beware

Don't you know it's the night of the demon
When spirits run high
Don't you know it's the night of the demon
When spirits run high

Better lock up your doors
And get off the streets
If you fear for the reaper of souls
For they say when he rides he never returns
'Til he's paid back the debt that he's owed

So beware of the night
As the darkness descends the terror's about to unfold
And pray that your life will be spared of the fate
You better beware

Don't you know it's the night of the demon
When spirits run high
Don't you know it's the night of the demon
When spirits run high

And the nightmare begins as the Devil rides out
From the heat through the gates of Hell
And there's no escape from the curse of the damned
You better beware

Don't you know it's the night of the demon
When spirits run high
Don't you know it's the night of the demon
When spirits run high
