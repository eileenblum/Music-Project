Like a river you keep flowing through me
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in your love
Just how long can I survive
With this weight so deep inside

I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way

Like a gambler on a losing streak
Played my cards, but you're misdealing me
Guess I should have realised
As I looked in your eyes

I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way

Need your lovin'
I can't let go
I'm a fighter guess
You always knew
I'll take all you can give and more
But you're sure worth living for

I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
I'm a fool to play it the hard way
