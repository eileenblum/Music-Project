It's time to get together
Thank God the night has passed
Through evil and through good things
You know we all must pass

It's time to make decisions
To see a better day
A lesson from this nightmare
We won't be fools again

Looking back on history
See confusion
And on every page the same mistake

And where's the line
Between the darkness and the light?
So short on time to be waiting for a sign
When you're stretched out on that line

It's time to make decisions
To see a better day
A lesson from this nightmare
We won't be fools again

Do we look for new beginnings
In the future or the past?
The end was always there right from the start

So take your time
You ain't going anywhere
Don't be so blind
You'll never cheat your fate
Don't your blow that fuse too late

It's all a mystery
Though I know it to be true
It's still a mystery
And it still comes down to you
You see it's just a point of view

It's time to make decisions
To see a better day
A lesson from this nightmare
We won't be fools again
