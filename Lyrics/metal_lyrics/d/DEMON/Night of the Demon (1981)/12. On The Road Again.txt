[Bonus Track]Headed out the jam
Loaded in the van
Back on the road again
Going out of my mind
Tryna make it on time
Back on the road again

Too tired to sleep
Too stoned to eat
Don't think I'll make it tonight
Need another shot
Straight rock 'n' roll
I guess I'm feelin' alright

Just another band on the road
On the road
Just another band on the road
On the road

Another crazy gig
What a way to live
Back on the road again
Drinking with the boys
Making too much noise
Back on the road again

Too tired to sleep
Too stoned to eat
Don't think I'll make it tonight
Need another shot
Straight rock 'n' roll
And I'll be feelin' alright

Just another band on the road
On the road
Back on the road again
Just another band on the road
On the road

Back on the road
Back on the road

Headed out the jam
Loaded in the van
Back on the road again
Going out of my mind
Tryna make it on time
Back on the road again

Too tired to sleep
Too stoned to eat
Don't think I'll make it tonight
Need another shot
Straight rock 'n' roll
And I'll be feelin' alright

Just another band on the road
On the road
Back on the road again
Just another band on the road
On the road
Back on the road again

Just another band on the road
On the road
Oh, yeah
Just another band on the road
On the road
Back on the road again

Just another band on the road
On the road
Oh
Just another band on the road
On the road
Back on the road again

Just another band on the road
On the road
