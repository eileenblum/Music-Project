Something is wrong inside your head
Who you think your foolin'
I don't believe a word that you said
Why'd you tell it to me

Liar your word is make believe
Liar you cheated and deceived
What ya doing oh what ya doing to me

I should have known right from the start
It was playin' with fire
You've given me hell, I've been through it all
Your a two bitten liar

Liar to you it's all the same
Liar to you it's just a game
What ya doing oh what ya doing to me
Your a liar, your a liar, your a liar

Something is wrong inside your head
Who you think your foolin'
I don't believe a word that you said
Why'd you tell it to me

Liar your word is make believe
Liar you cheated and deceived
What ya doing oh what ya doing to me
Your a liar, your a liar, your a liar
