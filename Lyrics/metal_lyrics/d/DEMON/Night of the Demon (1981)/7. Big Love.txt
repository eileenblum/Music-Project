My hair's too long my pants are too tight
I hit the bottle every night
They say I'm lazy good for nothin' at all
But what I've got all make'em holler and ball

Big love, big love
Big love, big love

I take my chances I go all the way
Ignore the warnings don't hear what they say
There ain't a woman can tie me down
Got big love spread it around

Big love, big love
Big love, big love
Got me some big love

Nothin' gonna come between us
Except big love
Nothin' gonna come between us
Except big love

Some like 'em big
Some like 'em small
I like it best when they're givin' it all
Don't pull no punches don't hold back on me
I ain't expensive what I get's for free

Big love, big love
Big love, big love

Nothin' gonna come between us
Except big love
Nothin' gonna come between us
Except big love

Big love, big love
Big love, got me some big love
