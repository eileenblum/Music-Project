Just crashed out of the city
On a brand new pair of wheels
And this world's lookin' so pretty
When your strapped to the mare of steel

We live every night, we live everyday
We live hard and fast there's no other way
When you ride the wind, when you ride the wind
Let's ride the wind

People say we're all bad news
Hell raisers in the heat of the night
But we ain't lookin' for trouble
It's just the highway we're settin' alight
Tonight I think I'm going over the top
Breaking the limits we ain't gonna stop

Till we ride the wind
Let's ride the wind
Ridin', ridin', ridin', the wind
Ridin', ridin', ridin', the wind

Just crashed out of the city
On a brand new pair of wheels
And this world's lookin' so pretty
When your strapped to the mare of steel

We live every night, we live everyday
We live hard and fast there's no other way
When you ride the wind, when you ride the wind
Let's ride the wind
