In the beginning he gave us the word
But a voice in the wilderness
Can never be heard
So he called for a father of time
Called on the father of time

I guess you've all heard of me
I count the cost
I was there at Calvary
When he died on that cross
I'm the father of time
I'm your father of time

And the world needs me now
Like never before
And the world needs me now
Like never before

I make the predictions
I am your fate
But when you're running with progress
You hear me too late
I'm the father of time
Yes I'm your father of time

And the world needs me now
Like never before
And the world needs me now
Like never before

Now I see destruction
Flames burnin' high
No need for the word now
No father of time
I'm the father of time
Yes I'm your father of time

And the world needs me now
Like never before
And the world needs me now
Like never before
