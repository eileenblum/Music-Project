Living free running wild
Ain't nobody gonna hold us down now, no how
We don't let nothin' stand in our way

So set 'em up for another round
Sleep through the day
And when the darkness
Hits the town
We're gonna have

One helluva night
What a helluva night
One helluva night
What a helluva night

We're caught in a crossfire
Lookin' for a clearing for
A touch down
We're hard ground
Don't know how the hell
We're gonna take the pace
You see we're livin' on an overload
Another lady, another station on the road
We're gonna have

One helluva night
What a helluva night
One helluva night
What a helluva night

Living free running wild
Ain't nobody gonna hold us down now, no how
We don't let nothin' stand in our way

So set 'em up for another round
Sleep through the day
And when the darkness
Hits the town
We're gonna have

One helluva night
What a helluva night
One helluva night
What a helluva night

One helluva night
What a helluva night
One helluva night
What a helluva night
