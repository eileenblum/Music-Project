[Chorus]

In the dead of the night you can see the spirits rise
In the dead of the night you can hear the cold wind cry

When you step out in the night
You can see the lightning strike
When you walk out on the moor
You can hear the thunder roar
The dogs are howling in the street
There's a full moon in the sky
You're just a scream awayâ¦ so scream!

[Chorus]

In the dead of the night you can see the spirits rise
In the dead of the night you can hear the cold wind cry
In the dead of the night you can see the spirits rise
In the dead of the night you can hear the cold wind cry

All the creatures of the dark
Have awoken from their sleep
All the demons of the deep
Are dancin' in the street
Manic laughter all around
But you don't make a sound
Eyes are watching every move
Who will they choose?

[Chorus]

In the dead of the night you can see the spirits rise
In the dead of the night you can hear the cold wind cry
In the dead of the night you can see the spirits rise
In the dead of the night you can hear the cold wind cry

There's nuthin' you can say, there's nuthin' you can do
There's no place left to hide, cos they're all after you

There's nuthin' you can say, there's nuthin' you can do
There's no place left to hide, they're all after you

[Chorus]

In the dead of the night you can see the spirits rise
In the dead of the night you can hear the cold wind cry
In the dead of the night you can see the spirits rise
In the dead of the night you can hear the cold wind cry

In the dead, in the dead, in the dead of the night
In the dead, in the dead, in the dead of the night
In the dead, in the dead, in the dead of the night
In the dead, in the dead, in the dead of the night
In the dead
