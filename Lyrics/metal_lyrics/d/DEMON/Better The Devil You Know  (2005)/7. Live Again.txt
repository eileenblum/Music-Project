I was a lost soul travelling in the dark
Too many memories for me
I couldn't let go
The past still haunted me
Like the ghost of someone else's dream

I still feel the heartache now
But everything has changed
Time's the greatest healer
But will it take away the pain
I still feel the heartache now
But everything has changed

[Chorus]

Gotta break away these chains and start to live again
Gotta take away these chains that bind
Gotta break away these chains and start to live again

We search for answers
But the question still remains
Do we wait forever or move on?
You can't forget them
The things that mean so much
But we all deserve that second chance

I still feel the heartache now
But everything has changed
Time's the greatest healer
But will it take away the pain
I still feel the heartache now
But everything has changed

[Chorus]

Gotta break away these chains and start to live again
Gotta take away these chains that bind
Gotta break away these chains and start to live again

Gotta live again, Gotta live again
Gotta live again, Gotta live again
Gotta live again, Gotta live again
Gotta live again, Gotta live again
Gotta live again, Gotta live again

[Chorus]

Gotta break away these chains and start to live again
Gotta take away these chains that bind
Gotta break away these chains and start to live again

Gotta take away these chains that bind
Gotta break away these chains and start to live again
Gotta take away these chains that bind
