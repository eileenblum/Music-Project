Can you feel the blood run through your veins?
Can you feel the magic in the air?
With just one kiss you will betray
And with one touch you'll turn away â turn away

[Chorus]

Temptation
Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do
Temptation
Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do

Do you know the meaning of eternal life?
And do you know the secrets of the night â of the night?
With just one kiss you will betray
And with one touch you'll turn away â turn away

[Chorus]

Temptation
Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do
Temptation
Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do
Temptation

Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do
Temptation
Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do

[Chorus]

Temptation
Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do
Temptation
Every time I look at you
Temptation
Every little thing you do
Temptation
