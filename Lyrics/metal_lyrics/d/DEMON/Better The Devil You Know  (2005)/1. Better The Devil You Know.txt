Are you afraid of the dark?
Are you afraid of what you might find?
Do you hide under the sheets at night?
And close your eyes?
Is there a wolf at the door?
Something screaming at the top of the stairs
Ghostly shadows outside your window
Is there anyone there?

It's something that creeps up on you
And starts playing tricks with your mind
If a bogey man's waiting for you
Imagine the horrors you'll find

[Chorus]

Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know

Is there a madman out there?
With bloodshot eyes that glow in the dark?
A headless rider haunting the street
With a deadly wail
Feel the chill in the air
Disturbing shapes that paralyse your mind
The supernatural is taking control
But you can't move

It's something that creeps up on you
And starts playing tricks with your mind
If a bogey man's waiting for you
Imagine the horrors you'll find

[Chorus]

Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know

You can run from the devil
You can run from the dark
You can hide from yourself, but you won't get far
You can run from the devil
You can run from the dark
You can hide from yourself, but you won't get far

Run from the devil, run from the devil
Run from the devil, run from the devil

[Chorus]

Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know

Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know

Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
Whoa-oh don't look behind you
Better the devil you know
