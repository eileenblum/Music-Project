A tortured soul who's down on his luck,
Crying in the rain
Like a wounded soldier who's calling out
Through the hurt and the pain
And that's the way it feels
It's tearing me inside
And this hurt, it's for real
It's tearing me inside

[Chorus]

I just need someone to change my life
I just need to be with you
I just need someone to change my life
I just need to be with you

A homeless traveller who's been scarred by life
Emotions running wild
A helpless victim of someone's love
Caught in the crossfire
And that's the way it feels
It's tearing me inside
And this hurt, it's for real
It's tearing me inside

[Chorus]

I just need someone to change my life
I just need to be with you
I just need someone to change my life
I just need to be with you

I just need someone to change my life
I just need to be with you
I just need someone to change my life
I just need to be with you

I just need someone to change my life
I just need to be with you
