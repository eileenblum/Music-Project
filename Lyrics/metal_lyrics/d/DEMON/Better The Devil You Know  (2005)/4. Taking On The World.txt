Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world this time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world

Too many years in the wilderness
This time we got it right
We've lived too long in the distant past
We're ready for the fight!
There's an air of expectancy
We're reaching for the sky
And in the 21st century
From the ruins we will rise!

The battle rages in every heart and every mind
We stand like heroes and we will win the prize

Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world this time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world

We'll ride the wave of emotion
Everybody's on a high
We'll lift the spirit of the nation
Well at least we'll try
We gonna take it all the way
There'll be no turning back
Gotta see the journey through
And take our place at last

The battle rages in every heart and every mind
We stand like heroes and we will win the prize

Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world this time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world this time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world

Fighting for freedom, we've got a reason
Survival's the name of the game
Marching together, living forever
That's our ultimate aim

Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world this time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world this time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh we'll take the world

Taking on the world, taking on the world
Taking on the world, taking on the world
Taking on the world, taking on the world
Taking on the world, taking on the world tonight
