[Chorus]

Standing on the edge of the world
Don't look back this is the ride of your life
Standing on the edge of the world
Engines on, it's your turn to fly

Bright lights all around you
Waves of sound inside your head
Black hole in the distance
It's just a dream somebody said
It's just a magic flight
Is it day or night?
We're on the edge of time now
It's just a crazy scene
A million laser beams
Kaleidoscope it seems
All round me now
And all the stars are out
In the sky tonight
And all the stars are out
In the heavens tonight

[Chorus]

Standing on the edge of the world
Don't look back this is the ride of your life
Standing on the edge of the world
Engines on, it's your turn to fly

Dark clouds sailing by me
Red mist a raging sea
Floating worlds passing by me
Can't believe the things I can see
It's just a magic flight, is it day or night?
We're on the edge of time now
It's just a crazy scene, a million laser beams
Kaleidoscope it seems all round me now
And all the stars are out in the sky tonight
And all the stars are out in the heavens tonight

[Chorus]

Standing on the edge of the world
Don't look back this is the ride of your life
Standing on the edge of the world
Engines on, it's your turn to fly

And on another day, we'll find another way
To go reaching for the stars
There'll be another day to find another way
We'll go reaching for the stars

[Chorus]

Standing on the edge of the world
Don't look back this is the ride of your life
Standing on the edge of the world
Engines on, it's your turn to fly

Standing on the edge of the world
Don't look back this is the ride of your life
Standing on the edge of the world
Engines on, it's your turn to fly
