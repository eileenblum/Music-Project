Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession

Lyin' eyes in the night, deceitful yet so cool
You'll never know they are there, watching every move
Crazy love, shattered dreams how'd you get to this
You'll never stop until you've broken every rule
You swore that you would never let it come to this
You'd walk away and let it be
Your obsession is ruining my life
Your deadly game is killing me

[Chorus]

Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession jealousy and pain
Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession

Poison letters, twisted nerve, vengeance is so cruel
Madness is all around; don't treat me like a fool
Hit and run, kiss and tell, everything to lose
Out of the shadows now like strangers in the night
You swore that you would never let it come to this
You'd walk away and let it be
Your obsession is ruining my life
Your deadly game is killing me

[Chorus]

Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession jealousy and pain
Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession

There's something in your eyes, there's something in your mind
There's something in your look, there's something in your smile
There's something in your voice, there's something in your stare
There's something in your stare, there's something in the night

You swore that you would never let it come to this
You'd walk away and let it be
Your obsession is ruining my life
Your deadly game is killing me

[Chorus]

Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession jealousy and pain
Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession jealousy &amp; pain

Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession jealousy and pain
Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession jealousy &amp; pain

Obsession, Obsession love is a deadly game
Obsession, Obsession jealousy and pain
