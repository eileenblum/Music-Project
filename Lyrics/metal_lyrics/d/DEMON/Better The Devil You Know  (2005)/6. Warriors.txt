Warriors - yeah, yeah yeah
Warriors - yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]

Warriors beware the night of a thousand angels â yeah, yeah, yeah
Warriors beware the eyes of the living dead â yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey what you doing, show your face you're not welcome around here
You looking for trouble, better get out this ain't your side of town
Caught in the crossfire, wheeling dealers asking more for the pound
You're in a state of madness; there ain't no space round for anything real

[Chorus]

Warriors beware the night of a thousand angels â yeah, yeah, yeah
Warriors beware the eyes of the living dead â yeah, yeah, yeah

Strange lights in the distance, maybe they've landed, maybe they're here
No go out in the desert, the heat is on, but who knows the truth
Stands and faces sunset, the evening sky goes red with the dust
Hell's bells are ringing out there - the last in line will reap the harvest you sow

Warriors beware the night of a thousand angels â yeah, yeah, yeah
Warriors beware the eyes of the living dead â yeah, yeah, yeah
Legions of the dark stand tall in the face of your enemy
Legions of the dark stand tall in the face of death

The sign on the street says paradise; I think I'll take a ride
Hey man where's the rainbows end?
All the cats round here are blind as bats
But the roads have eyes
Hey man that's weird

Warriors beware the night of a thousand angels â yeah, yeah, yeah
Warriors beware the eyes of the living dead â yeah, yeah, yeah
Legions of the dark stand tall in the face of your enemy
Legions of the dark stand tall in the face of death

Warriors beware the night of a thousand angels â yeah, yeah, yeah
Warriors beware the eyes of the living dead â yeah, yeah, yeah

Warriors! Warriors! Warriors! Warriors!
