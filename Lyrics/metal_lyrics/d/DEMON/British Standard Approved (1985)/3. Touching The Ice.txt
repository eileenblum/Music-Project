Heading in the new direction
Old bulldogs had its day
Steel wheels moving in slow motion
Think it's time to take our place

Let's rattle the cage
Work the machine
Let 'em know who you are
Shine to be seen

Crushed the cold hands of tradition
Who cares where you come from?
We're receivers of progression
Not signals out of phase

The mood on the street
Can't hold the line
To where will it lead?
Move on the tide

We are touching the whole human race
We are touching now
We are touching a time and a place
We are touching now

Touching, touching
Touching, touching

As we race to meet the future
A generation after face
Knowing nothing's really certain
Only the chance we gotta take

Don't need the disguise
To hide the mistakes
Rather run 'gainst the odds
Than sail on the waste
From the start of the gun
To the crossing of tape
In the eyes of the world
There's no escape

We are touching the whole human race
We are touching now
We are touching a time and a place
We are touching now
