It was there all the time
just couldn't make the shape
The room for expansion
Play through the gate
You were so nearly right
You were too damn close
You could have walked on the water
You never settled for less like most
We took the stage further in the extreme
For the featured awakening
A stand in between

Behind it all there's so much more
Behind it all there's so much more

Born out of chaos, grew through the dust
The force of emotion, really screwed us up
Left at loose ends, return to the screen
Pushed back the limits, caught sight of the dream

Behind it all there's so much more
Behind it all there's so much more
Behind it all we see so much more
