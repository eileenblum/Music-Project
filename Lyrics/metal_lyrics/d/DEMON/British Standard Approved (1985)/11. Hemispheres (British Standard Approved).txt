There are spaces in my mind
It's a fine line
So many places I have seen
Is this my time?

Eight ninths below the waterline
Out of my hands
Eight ninths below the waterline
Oh no

Another child left in the cold
Taken chances
Just breaking up inside
After all this

Never thought
Turn out like this
Where's the reason?
So much to give
Nothing left of me
Oh no

Take a look at me now
I'm a part of it all
Take a look at me now
Oh, I've become

God bless Her Majesty
God bless Her Majesty
God bless

As I stand here all alone
For one moment
I think of how it might have been
The other time

Eight ninths below the waterline
Out of my hands
Eight ninths below the waterline

Take a look at me now
I'm a part of it all
Take a look at me now
Oh, I've become

God bless Her Majesty
God bless Her Majesty
Long live Her Majesty
Die for Her Majesty
God bless Her Majesty
God bless Her Majesty
