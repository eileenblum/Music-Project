The sellout clothes they wear
Still fit the new line
Blood's thicker than water
So they say
It isn't what you know
But who you are
Where you've been
And what you've got

A first class ticket to the other side
That's what they all want
That's what they're all after
A first class ticket to the other side
That's what they all want
That's what they're all after

The school for boys taught
When to ride the waves
There's so much distance in between
The league of gentlemen
Still practice what they preach
And find contentment with their peers
No way you'll find them
On the wrong side of the street
That would never be their style
