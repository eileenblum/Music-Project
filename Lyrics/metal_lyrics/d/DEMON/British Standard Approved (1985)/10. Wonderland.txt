Still they dig for gold
Fooled on city streets
With no regard for mine
We watch the same repeats
Repeat the same mistakes
And swore we'd get it right next time

Riding high in Wonderland
Another runner in the UK
See the crossing from Wonderland
Shipping it back to the USA

We gave all hope and house
Giro's to Khyber Pass
No one wants to live next door
Who runs the northern line?
Who rules the Union Jack?
Nothing's really cricket, watch the score

Riding high in Wonderland
Another runner in the UK
See the crossing from Wonderland
Shipping it back to the USA

After all we heard it all before
And still the wheels go round
And for all the changes that were made
British standard, where's the standard?

The Chinese take-away
On empire's striking back
Watch clockwork soldiers fall in line
Land of hope and glory
Ruled by class
Still the British way of life

Riding high in Wonderland
Another runner in the UK
See the crossing from Wonderland
Shipping it back to the USA
