Another hand has turned
Across the face of time
Reaching out somewhere beyond
We're on the outside
Looking back at you
There's so much more to black and white

No more heroes they're left behind
Silent running
Turned full circle a high in the sky
Watching waiting

It's up to you to see it through
It's up to you to see it through
And if you're new, you'll see it through
And if you're new, you'll see it through

Free the memories, images are formed
Lightning switch across the lens
The line of forces travels in material waves
The spirit the crowded sometimes sense
One dimension, real world and the stage
Communication
Take advances as though men were more
Changing tempo

It's up to you to see it through
It's up to you to see it through
And if you're new, you'll see it through
And if you're new, you'll see it through

Together now we know we are
Together we are
Together what we speak we see
Together we see
