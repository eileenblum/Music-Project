Slip through the net
You're on your own
Crossing the water
With all the blue lights on
It's what you say
And what you do
Make for the change in the end

Sensing the warm glow
Got the picture now
Watching a star go out in the black hole
It's what you say
And what you do
Make for the change in the end

Proxima Centauri
Proxima Centauri

Waiting for the answer too long
Constant reminder too long
It's what you say
And what you do
Make for the change in the end

Approaching the centre
Got to think again
Scratching the surface
No beginning to end
It's what you say
And what you do
Make for the change in the end

Proxima Centauri
Proxima Centauri
Proxima Centauri
Proxima Centauri
