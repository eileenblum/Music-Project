Seeing things now
No one has seen
Am I so unique?
Will they know what I mean?

Standing on new ground
Standing on new ground

Changes were made
Outraced the light
Feeling no fear
Only wonder
In the eyes of it all
All nothing and this
We tore down the shadows
You didn't exist

Standing on new ground
Standing on new ground
Standing on new ground
Standing on new ground
So many memories
