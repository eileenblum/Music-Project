So much more for us to say
So much more for us
So much more for us to see
So much more for us

From the ship on the water
To new shifts in space
The true potential
Was staring us in the face
Froze to perfection
All senses preserved
Await the grand opening
As you waver the nerve

Behind it all there's so much more
Behind it all there's so much more
Behind it all we see so much more
Behind it all there's so much more
