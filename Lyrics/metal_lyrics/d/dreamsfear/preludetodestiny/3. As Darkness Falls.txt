[5:56]

I am the master of my destiny
But this man in the mirror I see
Cannot be me
Seems just like yesterday
My life lay before me
But now I am reaching the end
What have I done

My life is passing me by
Seems like I'm living to die
I want to stand in the light 
As darkness falls
[Repeat 2x]

All of the times I have dreamed
Of what I want to be
Seems to be up ahead yet still out of reach
Show me which way I should go
Which path I should take
To bring me to where I should be 
I'll reach my destiny

My life is passing me by... 
[Repeat 2x]

Once upon a time I had a dream, long ago
That everything I touch belonged to me and turned to gold
Now I know that dream can never be, it's far too late
Now I know that dream can never be, it's far too late

I just want to get the chance to be the best I can be 
Looking to the future I can't see what's in store for me
Looking to the future I am blind, can't see the light
Looking to the darkness I am blind, can't see the light

Can't see the light 
As darkness falls
