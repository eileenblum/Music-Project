[7:28]

Up from these ruins we'll rise
To conquer this world once again
Out of the dark, underground
We'll break free from these chains we are in

You never thought we'd be back from the dead 
Can you feel our breath on the back of your neck?
You'll know it's true when we kick in your door
You'll know it's real when your head hits the floor

No mercy this night 
We're out to destroy
From the ruins we rise

Fear takes control in a feeding frenzy
As chaos and panic sets in
Showing no mercy to all in our path 
Unstoppable killing machines

You never thought we'd be back from the dead...

No mercy this night... 
[Repeat 2x]

[Guitar lead]

Not forgiven and you'll never be forgotten
Can't forgive and then we won't forget
Can't believe we couldn't see it in your eyes
Can't believe we couldn't see through your lies

Here on this night we gather to fight
For venegence we fight
Waited so long now our time is in sight
Revenge is in sight

You're hanging on in the eye of the storm
Only a matter of time till you fall

[Guitar lead]

Not forgiven and you'll never be forgotten... 
[Repeat 2x]

No use seeking refuge 
Coz there's none here to be found
Showing no mercy to all in our path 
No mercy this night

Up from these ruins we'll rise
To conquer this world once again
Out of the dark, underground
These chains can't keep us in

You'll know it's true when we kick in your door
You'll know it's real when you're head hits the floor
