[7:10]

Waiting for the day to break
Another day another heavy cross to bear
The weight of your world upon me
Waiting for my chance to shine
Another place another time not on my side
The weight of my world upon me

Carry my cross every day
Carry your cross the same way
The weight of your world upon 
The weight of my world upon me 
[Repeat 2x]

No answers to my prayers, it seems
All my horizons they seem bleak
No answers to my prayers, it seems
Beyond the bleak remains unseen

Waiting as the nails go in
Another nail another sin that wasn't mine
The weight of your world upon me 
Waiting as they hammer in
Another nail another sin I can't forgive
The weight of my world upon me 

They hang me high every day
I hang you high in the same way
The weight of your world upon 
The weight of my world upon me

No answers to my prayers, it seems...

[Guitar lead]

Waiting for the day to end
Another day another friend I'll never need
The weight of your world crushing me
Waiting for my chance to sleep
Another day another promise they can't keep
The weight of my world crushing me 

Carry my cross every day
Carry your cross the same way
The weight of your world crushing 
The weight of my world crushing me 
[Repeat 2x]

No answers to my prayers, it seems...

No answers to my prayers, it seems
Beyond the bleak remains unseen
