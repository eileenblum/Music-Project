[8:04]

After all this time together 
After all that we've been through
It's only now I realise 
All the pain I've put you through
I hate myself when I think back
On all the things I've done
I'd like to make it up to you 
But I know my chance is gone

Some things I took for granted 
Within which beauty lies
But I admit I never 
Ever saw it in your eyes
Now, maybe I don't have the gift
To see the things that you see
Like when you said that you could see
Something beautiful in me

I never meant to hurt you
Never meant to cause you pain
I'd like to think I'd change it all
If I had the chance again
But those days are gone forever 
And there is no return
I'll never be the same again
I have let my bridges burn

Please forgive me one more time
One more time one more goodbye
Burning bridges all I see
Leaving the past behind me
Can you forgive me one last time
One last time one last goodbye
Burning bridges all I see
Leaving the past behind me

Now every time I see your face
I feel a change come over me
Coz every time I see your face
I see what might have been
As I get older and I see
My bridges burn around me
It's time to leave the past behind
There's something new out there to find

So please forgive me one more time...
