Have you come to wash my sins away
This, I wonder
You've turned blackest night to crystal
Yet, I wonder
Granted, every day I am dying
Still, I wonder
Why have you relinquished your life
This, I wonder

Nothing seems the same now that you are gone
I'll wait, I'll wait
For my star to fall with your name engraved
I'll wait, I'll wait
Still, I know the truth and what lies within
Wake up, please wake up
This is killing me and all that I am
Wake up, please wake up
What else do I have? What else do I want?
I'll wait, I'll wait
I won't see the world like I did before
I'll wait, I'll wait
Day by day, I live, while I wait to die
Wake up, please wake up
Nothing seems the same now that you are gone
Wake up, please wake up and make it stop
