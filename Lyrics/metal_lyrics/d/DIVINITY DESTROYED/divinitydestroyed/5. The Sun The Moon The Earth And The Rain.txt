I hold up my hands
I stare
And they are broken beyond all repair
All I can do is sit and think
Wondering how much more I'll sink
"Why, oh why", I ask the sky
Silence is its sole reply
Blinded by my light, my day
Light that once led my way
Bless me while I make my stand
Fighting for this cursed land
Comfort cannot compensate
I have not yet begun to hate
One sigh away from going mad
Now I am one short of what I once had
How could I, in all my time, destroy something so divine

Breathe in the sky
Bleed out the night
Breathe sky just to bleed night; I can't breathe

I hold up my hands
I stare
And they are broken beyond all repair
The sun, the moon, the earth, and the rain
All you ever gave was pain

Without you, I am damned
Forsaken
Forgotten
