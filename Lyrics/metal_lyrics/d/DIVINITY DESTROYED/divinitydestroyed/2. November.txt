I hold up my hands
I stare
And they are clean, untainted by the world
All I can do is sit and think
Think of what I could have changed
"Why, oh why", I ask the sky
In return all I hear is thunder
Blinded by my light, my day
Guided by my faith through the garden
Bless me while I make my stand
Watching, waiting for the storm
Comfort cannot compensate
Nothing could replace your arms
One sigh away from going mad
Reason hanging by a thread
Scrawled on the wall in tears and blood, these will be my final words

No tears
No sorrow
I'll wait for tomorrow

I gave everything I had
I gave everything I did not
All this time
All that time
This is not the way it was
Faceless figures in the dark gesture me to join their cause
I stand by what I believe even though I know the reality
Drain me of the dreams I've earned
Strip me of the pain
Make me one again
Find another way to breathe
I no longer give you consent
Lay the noose around my neck
Tie me to the stars above
Scrawled on the wall in tears and blood, these will be my final words

No tears
No sorrow
I'll wait for tomorrow
