Now
Here on this day
It begins
Pure innocence
Gone with doubt
Hold my flight up above
Cry your name to the wind

Wind my mind back to where I began
Try to accept my role in this game

I'll wait here for my time
I lived a lie and it made me one
I felt complete
I felt whole
I take it back, as I

Fall to my knees and reach for the sky

Take my eyes and make me one with the night
Use my fears to make this slow
Take my life and tell me who I should be
Pray I cannot call this home

Shrine
Take me alive to your hive
Vacate your throne as I die
Rain for days
Melt away
Bring me down
Bring me home
