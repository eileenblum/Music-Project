Speak your name just one last time
Then proceed to bite through my tongue
Close my eyes
Sew them shut
Then burn your face in my mind

Here in the night
Here in the dark
Stitches in my mind rip and tear apart
Leave me here undone
This, I see
This, I know:
This fight Iï¿½ll fight on my own

This is a war of silence I keep losing
Despite my senses, I cannot stop caring

The feel of thread behind my lids reminds me of when we were young
Scratch the walls
Bind my hands
And pray the night closes in

Thoughts in my head
Cancer of the mind
Letting chaos in
Killing all it finds
Leave me here unwhole
This, I see
This, I know:
This fight Iï¿½ll fight on my own

This is a war of silence I keep losing
Despite my senses, I cannot stop caring
Look to the light and slip into forever
Close your eyes and youï¿½ll see the life I wanted

Yours was the last face I saw before I lost my eyes
Yours was the last name I said before I gave up my voice
Yours were the last words I thought before I lost my mind
Yours was the last life I took before I took my own

Lost my eyes to make my point
And yet I still feel unfulfilled
I canï¿½t speak
I canï¿½t think without a fatal result

Two becoming one
One becoming two
You make me hate everything I do
But I will persist
This, I see
This, I know:
This fight Iï¿½ll fight on my own

This is a war of silence I keep losing
Despite my senses, I cannot stop caring
Look to the light and slip into forever
Close your eyes and youï¿½ll see the life I wanted
