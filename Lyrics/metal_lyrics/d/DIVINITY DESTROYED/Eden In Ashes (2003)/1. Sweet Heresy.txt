No more words

Rise
And take your place beside me in all that I've built in disgrace
Grace the halls with curdling calls and watch the sky
The kingdom falls
Blight
Make haste your retreat
Make it with tact, make it discreet
Flood the world, drown the strife, and wash away this tainted life

Taunt the sane
Pinch the vein
Strike the night and scream at the rain
The more I know, the more I hate
Thus begins the Inside

Brick by brick
I begin to rebuild my temple of mourning instilled
Sing us a song for those who have passed
Those who have learned, those who were last
I will ride the changing tide
Start at the end and walk to the sun
Know that you've passed
Know that you've won

Taunt the sane
Pinch the vein
Strike the night and scream at the rain
The more I know, the more I hate
Thus begins the Inside

Sacrifice my right to rot
My chance to heal
My one escape
It's crashing down
I know the sound of pestilence
Of children screaming out

I know you and have seen what you do
I alone
I will not compromise how much pain I inflict

Sovereignty
My paradise burnt down
Effigy, I ask of thee,
"O Heresy, sweet Heresy, you've seen the gates. Now lead me through them"

One more day left to play
Where's the love?
Where's the blood?
I refuse to believe that this is all there is

I feel no shame
I place no blame
Although you've changed, I feel the same

I don't belong
I don't exist
I'll try my best to forget this
