I shall never surrender
How could I cease to recall?
I am the only one left to be this alone
As each day passes by
I celebrate one less to live on this way without you

Mirror breaks, but who's in there
And I can't look long
I won't find you there
Because

She calls to me in my...

Broken dreams are the way we shall live
And through darkened hallways, I pass all I've lived for

Paintings line the walls and
Take me back to the times when lucidity reigned
But how do I return?
Blind to everything here
I lose vision of all that remains all around
As I lose that as well

Innocence captured here in time
Echoes of the past
Pleading me to stop
And yet...

She calls to me in my...

Broken dreams are the way we shall live
And through darkened hallways, I pass all I've lived for
Alone in this world as I stand in the night falling
Deeper from where I thought that I had hit bottom

Plead on my knees so I may breath my last breathe which sets me free
Scream to the seas so that I may drown deep within their depths and cease to be

With your untimely end, I am reborn
In this world of hate for those who have what they love
How long must I remain with this corrupted soul
Crying tears of blood
Until empty, I fall

Long hallways keep them from my mind
Hidden
No one sees through the barriers
Only

She calls to me in myï¿½

Broken dreams are the way we shall live
And through darkened hallways, I pass all Iï¿½ve lived for
Alone in this world as I stand in the night falling
Deeper from where I thought that I had hit bottom
Return to me, my strength
My soul still perseveres onward
You reach for my hand
And then pull me away from this

The sun feels as I remembered that day
As the light healed this withering canvas
Yearning to be free
But not to be lost
I came here reluctantly
But knew I belonged
How had I fallen so far?
