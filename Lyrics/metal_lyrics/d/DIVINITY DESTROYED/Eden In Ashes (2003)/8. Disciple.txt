Down on your knees
Pledge to no one
Bow before me
I can never
Know
I can give you everything
Pain
Show me how to accept

I am here
Save your tears

Only the penitent will survive

Trust unto me
Give me reason
Salvate yourself
On my own time
Lie
Put another nail in place
Die
This, the one and only

I am here
Save your tears

I reject your sympathy
I renounce your humble pity
Not from you or anyone
I need it not
I weep for no one

Reach inside of me and you will feel the lust for hate
For war
Excruciating need
I want a way to see into your mind
Your soul
Your veins
To claim what's mine

Burn at my feet
Dust to dust
Rise from your grave
If I must
Strength
More power than a thousand gods
Black
Shining through the wasteland

I am here
Save your tears

Only the penitent will survive

Down on your knees
