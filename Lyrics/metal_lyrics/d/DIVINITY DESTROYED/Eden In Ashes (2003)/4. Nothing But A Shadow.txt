Trust in me and I will set your heart afire
In time, in time
Touch me with your soothing hand, my desire
In time, in time
Your voice an angel choir, hypnotized, I close my eyes
In time, I will find my way
My glass heart I give to you, shatter me within this shell
In time, I will find my way
Carve your name into my skin; mix your tears into my blood
I hear the cries above calling down for me
I lift myself up to my feet; the strength Iï¿½ve gained will be your fall
In time, I will have my way

You wonï¿½t believe my suffering was all for you
In time, in time
I have shed my blood, my life, in your name
In time, in time
Beauty lay with fallen gods; silent prayers fall on deaf ears
In time, I will find my way
Distant cries of agony, I lay you down upon your bed
In time, I will find my way
Penetrate your shallow hear, the love I felt I cannot find
I hear the cries above calling down for me
Broken dreams of ecstasy, awake to hear your frightened screams
In time, I will have my way

I donï¿½t need you
Here I stand, I am the only one
I release you
Here I am, kneeling before you

I am nothing but a shadow in your eyes

Hold my heart over an open flame
I donï¿½t mind if I never see the light again
Here I am
