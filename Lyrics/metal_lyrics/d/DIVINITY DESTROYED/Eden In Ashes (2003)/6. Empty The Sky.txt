One step from my horizon
I think, I dream, I wonder
My honor yearns for reason
I plant this seed of treason

"I, the sky
"I, the heavens
I declare my intentions"

Rain down
Bleed forever
Nothing is held from the dead

I'll rip down the stars, both hands
And wait for the sign, my final act
Die with the sun, burn cold
I'll empty the sky just to believe

Grown into full conception
I sow, I reap, I return
Dealing out retribution
Let truth be known through bloodshed

"I, the sky
"I, the heavens
I declare my intentions"

Weighed down
False endeavor
Truth revealed at my end

I'll rip down the stars, both hands
And what for the sign, my final act
Die with the sun, burn cold
I'll empty the sky just to believe

I will fall and thus the sky will follow

I will fall and thus the sky will follow
