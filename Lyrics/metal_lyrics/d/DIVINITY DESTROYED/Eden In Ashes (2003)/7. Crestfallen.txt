I feel the wind tonight
Cold
Under pale moonlight
Staring out through the soul of me
Dreaming of false reality

Shades of the frost break with her steps
Restoring life to living death

Overwhelmed by the lust I have
Losing thoughts that I once possessed
Reminisce as to why Iï¿½m here
I still wonder why

Yield the will to live my life
Release the soul that I have lost

Night
Hidden us from the light
Truth vanishing with the day
Time takes you away from me
Death
Setting us with the sun

Lies fill the mind of you
Trusting all what I say is true
Staying here as I leave this place
Bitter winds will guide us to the end

I am alive just as you are
We lay to rest as the snow falls

I am keeping her from the end
You are bringing the end to me
I am watching the changing leaves
Night comes to us as they fall

Finally we fall together
Dreams that were so real to me
I can never leave without her
"I spill forth my blood for thee"

The winter is the dawning dark
As the autumn is torn apart
The life force of a lifeless force
The ending I am dreaming up all on my own

Gazing up at a thousand stars
Crystalline windows to her eyes
My throat will open up my veins
I fall in blood up to my knees

Stream of my mind flowing through time
"I will only die with her"

Breathe
Struggling only to
Choke
Whisper an absolute
Cry
All that I want is to
Die
And never look back again

This time Iï¿½ll embrace my destiny
This wind is our dying breath
My life I have given you
The thought of us was all I knew

The winter is the dawning dark
As the autumn is torn apart
The life force of a lifeless force
The ending I am dreaming up all on my own
