Every night I see your face in the stars gazing down
In the field standing all alone, looking up, all alone
Your voice was a melody, now just a memory
Rising out of the black abyss I see the moon's red reflection

All in one night
Love at first sight
All in one night
Only one night

Every night, I see your eyes in the mist watching me
I am one with the falling rain, crashing waves call out your name
Staring out into the sea, drowning in an emerald ocean
Rising out of the black abyss I see the moon's red reflection

All in one night
Love at first sight
All in one night
Only one night
