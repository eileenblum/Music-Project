I came back for you

I don't recognize this place I called home
Paintings conceal cracks that could not heal

All my life I heard your voice
Why did I wait so long...

I came back for you

I don't recognize this place I called home
Windows replaced
Scars on that same face

All my life I heard your voice
Why did I wait so long...

Lock the empty room
Leave the key inside
Turn and walk away
Leave it all behind

Purge the fear of your own design
I will help you to mend a broken line

I know these words mean nothing
