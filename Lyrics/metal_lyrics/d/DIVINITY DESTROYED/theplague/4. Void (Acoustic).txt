Roads surround my fate
I chose the hardest way
Longing to be free
No one else but me

Dig a deeper hole
Caging up my soul
Trudging through the mud
It runs in my blood

Climbing from the depths, I hear the
Promises I made, why can't I
Run from the shadows, haunts me
Why

In my nightmares, I saw darkness
In that darkness, I found no one
I was destined to walk that path
A path that has been traveled alone

Spewing from my mind
Lies I could not hide
Tears wept at great length
Hatred, give me strength

Climbing from the depths, I hear the
Promises I made, why can't I
Run from the shadows, haunts me
Why

In my nightmares, I saw darkness
In that darkness, I found no one
I was destined to walk that path
A path that has been traveled alone

Don't even lie, I can see right through you

Tragic truth now as a crystal
It's become as clear as day
The corrosion of my essence
Falling, crumbling, withering within
