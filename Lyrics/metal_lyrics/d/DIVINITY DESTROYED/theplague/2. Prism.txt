I've said it all before the same way
The words are taking on divergence
Why veil the treason with intention
Myopic misinterpretations

Shine the way
With one all encompassing truth
Bemuse the minds that abuse
Spread the light in every direction
Pave the path without one correction
Taint the law
With views only you could conceive
I hear things I would never believe
As much as I may again be your guide
I fail over and over again

You know the feeling that I get
When I am around all the chaos
I have to feed it

Once all the floodgates are open
I cannot control where it goes
The ebb and the flow

This is the fight I had in mind
One to cradle my newborn lie

You own the feeling, the hatred, the healing
You changed what mattered the most
The meaning

Time to take my life
I'll slice away the skin with my knife
I hope they see
They brought the misery unto me
To autumn's winds, I pray
Please free me from my pain on this day
He breathes, I choke
I'll end his life
I swear I'll slit his throat

Help me I'm scared
There is blood everywhere
Ignoring my cry alone I now die

I've said it all before the same way
The words are taking on divergence
Why veil the treason with intention
Myopic misinterpretations
