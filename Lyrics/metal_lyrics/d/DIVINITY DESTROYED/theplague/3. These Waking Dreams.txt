Drifting deeper in the jade
Drowning in the verde fade
Slowly I am swept away
Taken to a darker day

When you were not mine, fate resigned
Blood was paid and flesh betrayed
If I could find the way back home
I know I'd see you waiting there for me
So we could lock away our memories
And with the dawn, we'll be reborn

Your clientele
My padded cell
I'll never win this fight
I'll never see our light
There is no cure
Poison the pure

Pictures pulsing in and out
Vertigo via roundabout

Broken glass photographs
Afterthought epitaphs
Marching under banners of death
Spare me, o wicked tongue
Echoes of other lungs
Breathing your breath

You cried out their names
Casting hope down in flames

If I could find the way back home
I know I'd see you waiting there for me
So we could lock away our memories
And with the dawn, we'll be reborn

Your clientele
My padded cell
I'll never win this fight
I'll never see our light
There is no cure
Poison the pure

I want to forget these waking dreams
