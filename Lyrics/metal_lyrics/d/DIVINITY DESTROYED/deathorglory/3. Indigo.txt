Each step every day
I am not alone
My guilt for a light that has never shown
This haunting pain feels like home
Suddenly family has another meaning
I'll see you in the next life

Another day goes by for me
I'm sorry yours was not to be
And never will

Why did I send you away?
Is all of this worth what you paid?
I won't ever know

I weep for a cross that was never born
If I never knew, would I ever mourn?
Lines fade on a vague moral rainbow
Black and white, day and night
Wrong and right
Oh I envy simplicity

Another day goes by for me
I'm sorry yours was not to be
And never will

How could I bring back what is gone?
I cannot change what I have done
I can only wait

Asleep inside the womb
No stranger place to call a tomb
This way at least you will be
Close to me

And when the night is near
I see you shining bright and clear
Tonight I think I'll count the stars again

I'll never lose a race
I'll never see that smiling face
I'll never get the chance to tuck you in

You have forgiven me
And that's the greatest tragedy
I won't be able to forgive myself

How can I wave goodbye
With blood all over my hands?
