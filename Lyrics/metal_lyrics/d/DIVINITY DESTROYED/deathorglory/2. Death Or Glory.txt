Blood fills my eyes
Screaming drowns out the world
Chaos, confusion
A melee soiree

Survival and murder
Are dancing together
I never was forced to endure this
The choice was mine

Home and family are waiting
Worried and wondering
How did I get here?
How am I still here?

Time and again
Mercy flaunts it's releases
I've made my stand
And I back down for no man

Bring me the eyes of the blind
Being me the hearts of the faithless
Let Hell have them

Ravens sing the final song
Toll the bells before the dawn
Martyrs by morning
Our banners: 'Death or Glory'

Suffer no fear
Suffer no odds
Suffer no fate
Nor the will of the gods

Some lack the vision to see
The nerve to believe
They call our crusade
A fool's errand

How can you call that life
If you've not risked it
Breathing, existing, and yearning
Without ever earning

Bring me the eyes of the blind
Bring me the hearts of the faithless
Let Hell have them

Ravens sing the final song
Toll the bells before the dawn
Martyrs by morning
Our banners: 'Death or Glory'

Will I live to see the sunlight?
Will I dance with death tonight?

Twilight breaks
With many against one
How can I yield?
I am not done

Hell can wait

Ravens sing the final song
Toll the bells before the dawn
Martyrs by morning
Our banners: 'Death or Glory'
