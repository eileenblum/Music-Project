Too many times I am reminded
What I sow I reap
Thanks for the tip
But my own council will I keep
It's such a shame
You only see as far as hope is high
If only you could see
What I've seen with your eyes

Choke down that advice reflex
And we'll all get by just fine
Tuck back the pearls of wisdom
Or you'll feel a piece of my mind

Who are you to tell me what is right?
You listen close
It's my fucking life
I'll let the rain fall where it may

How many dreams have you erased?
So far between and few
And I wonder why
The world got the best of you
Feel free to disagree
But you'll just be a brick in my wall
So take me as I am
Or don't take me at all

Choke down that advice reflex
And we'll all get by just fine
Tuck back the pearls of wisdom
Or you'll feel a piece of my mind

Who are you to tell me what is right?
You listen close
It's my fucking life
I'll let the rain fall where it may

Too late to think of stopping now
I can't give up
I don't know how
I will not live and die a slave

Have I always been wrong?
Maybe just maybe I don't belong
Am I lost in the deep?
Maybe just maybe I'll stay asleep

I do not want to wake up from this

Save me

[Solo - Flanegan]

And now I realize
The dream was never as it seemed
What's there to wake up from
When it's all real to me?
