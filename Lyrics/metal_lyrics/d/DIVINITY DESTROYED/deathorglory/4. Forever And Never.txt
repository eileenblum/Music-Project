I do not threat, I do not warn
I only speak of what I'll mourn
Every time you turn and run
You blindly aim your loaded gun

Ironic place for pride to be
You are your own worst enemy
Every dream chased in haste
Another day gone to waste

Time burns short
Patience thins
Keep this up
No one wins

Will this end?
It just might
So hold me close
Hold me tight

Close your eyes and open wide
Meet me on the other side
You're not the kind you find every day
But I would leave you anyway

I do not threat, I do not warn
I only speak of what I'll mourn
Faith alone is not a plan
Save us now, I know you can

Time burns short
Patience thins
Keep this up
No one wins

Will this end?
It just might
So hold me close
Hold me tight

Close your eyes and open wide
Meet me on the other side
You're not the kind you find every day
But I would leave you anyway

We dance an endless dance
How long must this continue
We could go separate ways
But they would just be circles

These sunsets feel the same
Fools weep but I know better
I will remember them
I will remember yesterday
