Tied down to the floor it's an endless nightmare
Break another bone, it's your ass that I'm beating
Cut through your flesh, the screams get louder
Live another day, now I'm pissed I didn't kill you

Dormant
Arise
Fire burning high

Hold my rage back
I don't want you near me
Hold my grin back
As I watch you burn

Horrified by the sight before me
Skinless face staring right back at me
Walls of fire, towering walls of fire
All around, all, all around
Purified by the pain I'm giving
I will free you of the life you're living
Walls of fire, towering walls of fire
All around, all, all around me

The sleeper has awakened and your heart beats louder
Lost in the haze of a broken down mind
Reach into my soul for an ounce of mercy
A sea of pain is all you'll find

Dormant
Arise
Fire burning high

Hold my rage back
I don't want you near me
Hold my grin back
As I watch you burn

Horrified by the sight before me
Skinless face staring right back at me
Walls of fire, towering walls of fire
All around, all, all around
Purified by the pain I'm giving
I will free you of the life you're living
Walls of fire, towering walls of fire
All around, all, all around me

Stare at the sky as the light starts to darken
Call to your god but no one answers
The sleeper has awakened and the end is near
Scream to the heavens for the angel of death

Dormant
Arise
Fire burning high

Hold my rage back
You don't want me near you
Hold my grin back
As I watch you burn

Horrified by the sight before me
Skinless face staring right back at me
Walls of fire, towering walls of fire
All around, all, all around
Purified by the pain I'm giving
I will free you of the life you're living
Walls of fire, towering walls of fire
All around, all, all around me

I am not who you remember
I'm alive, I have awakened
I'm the fire, you are the ashes
I'm the fire, you are the ashes
Bleed for me, give me what I've needed
Die for me, show me I succeeded
I'm the fire, you are the ashes
I'm the dream, you are the memory
