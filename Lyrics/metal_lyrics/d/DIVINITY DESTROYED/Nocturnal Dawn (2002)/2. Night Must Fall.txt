Blood drips from my lips and paints a vivid picture of you
My tears seep into the soil and poison all the rivers
Deny me of my sky and feel the wrath inside me
My arms, your casket, my eyes, a doorway to my soul

I can't die
I am forever

Blood drips from my lips and paints a vivid picture of you
My tears seep into the soil and poison all the rivers
Deny me of my sky and feel the wrath inside me
Fragile, immortal creature, a shadow of myself

I can't die
I am forever
