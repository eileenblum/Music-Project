High in the sky, I see you falling
Why do you think that I will catch you?
Past the clouds a burning fire
Hear it sing like a choir
You gave much more than you should have
My first words are your last rites
Deep within my vacant mind
Sits the thought,
"Maybe there is hope..."

Rays of light pour from my eyes and
Baptize all that lay beneath me
Everything that I have gained is
Nothing next to all I've lost
I surrender to the blackness
Hoping, praying for acceptance
Deep within my vacant mind
Sits the thought,
"Maybe there is hope..."

No sins, yet forsaken
When will I awaken...
This truth I won't swallow:
I have become hollow
I'll wait for tomorrow
Where there is no sorrow
I see a light in the darkness
I weep as that light goes out

Neverending pain
Driving me insane
No more, I can't take it
Silent cries
Bloodshot eyes
I'll defy you til I fall
Final living breath
Welcomed into death
Mercy please, I'll beg for mercy
Now alone
On my own
All I wanted was salvation

Lost and staring at the ground I
Realize: "I am nothing"
Tears are streaming down my face and
Seeping deep into my wounds
I am beaten, I am battered
Dripping blood, my wings are tattered
Broken, I fall to my knees and
Cry to the sky,
"Heaven, take me home"
