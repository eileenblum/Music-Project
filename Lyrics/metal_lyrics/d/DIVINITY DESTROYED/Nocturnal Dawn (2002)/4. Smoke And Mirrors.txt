You don't know the meaning of misery
You dragged me down, brought me down
Your life is nothing more than an illusion
And I know your emotions inside out
You don't even know

Why can't you see through the lies
Wake up and open your eyes
Please don't abandon my side
If I don't leave you, I'll die

Fuck you and all your bullshit, waste my time
You, I'll drag you down, rip you down
My smile is nothing more than an illusion
And I know your emotions inside out and
You won't ever know

Why can't you see through the lies
Wake up and open your eyes
Please don't abandon my side
If I don't leave you, I'll die
If I dont leave you, I'll die

In my eyes, I see you burning

Never again
Hold you
Never again
Touch you
Never again
With you
Never again
Cry for you
