In your eyes I see
your illusion
Years of misery
life you've stolen
Spiral further down
deep inside you
I've become unwound
falling apart

Soul torn open wide
spill forth from me
Nothing left inside
all but a void
On my knees, I pray
no one answers
As I rot away
waiting for you

Love has faded like a dying ember
Nothing short of torture to remember
Moving on and spreading my infection
I can't bear to gaze at my reflection

Penetrate your mind
raping your thoughts
Breaking ties that bind
sever forever
On my knees, I pray
no one answers
As I rot away
waiting for you

Love has faded like a dying ember
Nothing short of torture to remember
Moving on and spreading my infection
I can't bear to gaze at my reflection

Pale blood running thin
bleeding for you
Broken life within
running from you
On my knees, I pray
praying for you
Envy and decay
rotting for you

Love has faded like a dying ember
Nothing short of torture to remember
Moving on and spreading my infection
I can't bear to gaze at my reflection

Do you love me?
No
Do you want me?
No
Please stay with me
No
Just leave me alone
