[performed by Diabolicum]Malignant uncosmic movements
Paralyses the universal cycles
Creation of Cephiroth
Embraced in the blackness of chaos
Darkness reigns
As the Samaelilith unites
The worlds set aflame
and mankind beholds with dread fiiled eyes

The War Tide
War Tide
War Tide
The War Tide

Let the slaughter begin !

Come on !

All out Genocide
As the star of darkness descend
The serpent crawls
Upon the weeping face of jehovah
The infernal shockwaves
Strikes through heavens and earth
Universal downfall
Starts the ancients rebirth
