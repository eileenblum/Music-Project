[Music &amp; Lyrics: Sasrof]

When the last of limits is passed
Through out eons in vain
What has been created shall be slain
What has been raised shall fall
Mankind is nothing but agony
Life is nothing but pain
Cleanse the orb almighty fire
Unchain the infernal desire
Worthless kingdom of fleshly slaves
Filthy whores of the loving God
The age of wrath upon us
The age of everlasting darkness
Holy beautiful races
No prays can save you now
Moaning beautiful faces
Scream soaked in your urine and blood

It will arrive
That wonderful black day
It all will end
When the winds shall slay

When the last of limits are passed
Through out eons in vain
What has been created shall be slain
What has been raised shall fall
Life will never arose
Chaos shall forever reign
The wind shall slay
That wonderful black day
