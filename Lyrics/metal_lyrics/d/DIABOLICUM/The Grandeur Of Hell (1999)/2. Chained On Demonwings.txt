[Music &amp; Lyrics: Sasrof, Nathzhion]

Satan!
I chant your names this sombre night
To unchain thy forces of malignant arts
The spirits of bleak dimensions
To pierce my burning wicked heart
In the name of the unholy I die
As I drift into damnation
The vortex of chaos appears
My death will be creation
A sacrifice in blasphemy
My life for the opening of the moaning well
I die by my own hand
In the name of the almighty grandeur of Hell
:OF HELL!!!
Gehinnom opens:
Lucifer, Belzeebuth, Belial, Leviathan
Hatred reigns within my soul
I fall beyond the life astray
As the greedy flames of death
Tears my weak flesh away
(I join the glory of Moloch)
Dominus Sathanas
Ad majorem Satanae gloriam
Moloch, Thaumiel, Belzeebuth, Ghagiel, Lucifuge, Satariel
Slay the infants for Moloch
All tears for his eternal thirst
(Come forth; Ruler of Sheol)
A sacrifice in blasphemy
My life for the opening of the moaning well
I die by my own hand
In the name of the almighty grandeur of Hell
Shadows darkens my mind
As the last of my lifelight dims
Mesmerized by Devil flames
I depart chained on demonwings
-Darkness decends-
Lucifer, Belzeebuth, Belial, Leviathan
Hatred reigns within my soul
I fall beyond the life astray
As the greedy flames of death
Tears my weak flesh away
I fall into the raging flames!!!
