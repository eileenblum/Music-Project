[Music &amp; Lyrics: Sasrof]

Frozen in silent numb
Cold and dead is it?s destiny
A black world
Lifeless for eternity

Abomination
Desolation
All life has been ended
All lies been burnt
Feeble creation
Feeble mankind
Engulfed in the order of Hell
Marduk fell
Marduk died
As the burning god
Reaped the orb
Creation ended

Drowned in the fire tide
As the gates of chaos opens wide

Within

Beyond

Above

He reigns

Hail Tiamat

Hell Dominus

Azarate!
Apsu!

Azarate!
