Attack the cathedral of sickness
bring down the temples of the rotten empire
Execute its priests, its women,
its teachers, its leaders

Hands of my life
Hands of our lives
Hands of my life
Hands of our lives

I will use anything I can
to reach my target
And when hands will be my only weapon
I will sacrifice a finger
Then a hand, an arm
To stop your machines

This is my war
A one man's war
This is my war
A one man's war

I don't give a fuck about all those innocents
That may fall on my way
This enemy is too big to be fed
This parasite is too big to be fed

This is my war
A one man's war
This is my war
A one man's war

Hands of my life
Hands of our lives
Hands of my life
Hands of our lives

I will use anything I can
to reach my target
And when hands will be my only weapon
I will sacrifice a finger
Then a hand, an arm
To stop your machines
An army of one I'll stick to my gun
