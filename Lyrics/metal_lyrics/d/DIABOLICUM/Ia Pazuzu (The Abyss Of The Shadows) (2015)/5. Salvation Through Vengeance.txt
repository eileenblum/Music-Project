I believe in the destruction of Zion
for there lies the nest of the deceitful snake
Where the great enslavement where planned
and forged the sword which rules all land
Its pulpits speaks into every heart
seducing our young with treacherous words
bringing life to its sanctimonious breed
and commands the empire of havoc and greed

This is their age
This is their reign
This is their world
and this is our pain

We call for salvation through vengeance
We call for redemption through death
Let our will be done and send this orb off to die
and let our fate be written in the ashcloud sky
