Sleep tight filthy angel
for this life is not yours to suffer
Urine soaked spawn of a whore
never for this world to endure
Relax and the pain succumbs
and all your nightmares fade
For soon your reach the end of day
and all the world will go away

See the heavens so silvery bright
there is where you will be tonight
