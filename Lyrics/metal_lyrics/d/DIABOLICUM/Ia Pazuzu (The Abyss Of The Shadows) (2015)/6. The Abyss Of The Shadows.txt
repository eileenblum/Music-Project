I dwell beyond the flickering lights
and resides in the essence of you all
I sing your young to sleep
and whisper the glory of death

I will lead your heart and soul
into the abyss of the shadows
For I was born as my father died
in tribute to his mighty name

No prayer can sway me
and no man can ever be my foe
For I am the son of darkness
and I wait for my mother return

I will divide the skies
and light the second sun
The nations I will trample
and all flesh I will devour
