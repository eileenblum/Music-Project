I see no joy in life
this grey room
with no view nor door
I see nothing but treason
this tainted world
with no sky nor shore
I can see all colors fade
the icons dead
all winds turn
In the night of the scarecrow
where the shadows burn

These fields are ripe for harvest
These streets to be cleansed
The chains to be broken
and the age of steel ensure

I see no joy in life
this depleted dream
this flow of pain
With no lie hushed
the moaning queen
in her kingdom crushed
I see only the maelstrom
strangling every breath
With the voice of love
I speak the words of death

Genocide bliss
