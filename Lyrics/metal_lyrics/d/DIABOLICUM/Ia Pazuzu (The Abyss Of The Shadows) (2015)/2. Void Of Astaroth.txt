Hang the nooses from the streetlights
Abandon all hope and compassion
Tear the laws asunder
Crush the rotten heart of man
Our god is the world eating pit
and the sea of perdition
And there are no flesh nor order
that deserves to be spared

From the void of blood it's rising
calling from the kingdom of the ever dead
The hatecrowned star of evil wander
until the beast of hatred is forever fed
Forever kept in sacred hands
the seed of fire blazes in the somber skies
Ash shall pour from heaven
as the mother moans and all of her creation dies

From death comes only salvation
no second chance and no forgiveness
No more chained to the wheel of decay
In a world of thorns and venom

This is the void of Astaroth
