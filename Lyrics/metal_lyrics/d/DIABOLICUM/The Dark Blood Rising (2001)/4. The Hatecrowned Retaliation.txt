[Sasrof]

Malicious winds of hatred
Created by the lust to kill
Born of the holocaust's might
To lead the world into the endless night
Raging blazing fires
The very manifestation of death
End of the pointless strife
Build to slay all the aspects of life
Earth divider destroyer of the weak
The end with thousand names
The final cure to all our pains
The war of all wars
Carrier of extermination
A worldwide suicide
The global genocide

From the chaos era forlorn
Bring to this world the fire dawn

You are the end
The furious flow with the venomus tide
The flaming essence of darkness
Which the feeble light never dares defy
The wind of slaughter
The grandeur of total termination
Reaper of the worlds
The hatecrowned retaliation

Malicious winds of hatred
Created by the lust to kill
Born of the holocaust's might
To lead the world into the endless night
Raging blazing fires
The very manifestation of death
End of the pointless strife
Build to slay all the aspects of life

Mankind! Are you ready to greet!? Hell!!!

From the chaos era forlorn
Bring to this world the fire dawn

You are the end
The furious flow with the venomus tide
The flaming essence of darkness
Which the feeble light never dares defy
The wind of slaughter
The grandeur of total termination
Reaper of the worlds
The hatecrowned retaliation
