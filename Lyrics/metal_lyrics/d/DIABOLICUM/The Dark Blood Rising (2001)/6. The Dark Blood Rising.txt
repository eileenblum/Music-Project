[Sasrof]

In the bleak depths of our souls
The memory of hell still remains
From the aeon of the eternal dark
From times before the living pains
(we) the union of warriors so mighty
Awaits to slay the bastard horde
To embrace this world with fire
To raise the blood of the battle lord

Hatecrowned legion
In silence stalks the worlds
The black souls of chaos
The glorious soldiers of satan
Spirits of the ancient pride
Summoned by the infernal call
Awaits armageddon
To finally witness jehovah's fall

Fall!!!
Can you fell it breed
Can you fell it coming
The truth which torments
The heart of man

Dark Blood Rising

Dark Blood Coming

Vovin!

[For the misanthropic legion]
