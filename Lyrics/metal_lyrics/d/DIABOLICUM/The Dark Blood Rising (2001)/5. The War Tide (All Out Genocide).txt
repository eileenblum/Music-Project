[Sasrof, Nathzhion]

Malignant uncosmic movements
Paralyses the universal cycles
Creation of cephiroth
Embraced in the blackness of chaos
Darkness reigns
Samelilith unites
The worlds set aflame
And mankind beholds with dread filled eyes

The war tide
War tide
Let the slaughter begin!

Come on!

All out genocide
As the stars of darkness descends
The serpent crawls
Upon the weeping face of jehovah
The infernal shockwaves
Strike through heaven and earth
Universal downfall
Starts the ancient's rebirth

By the war tide
War tide

[For the eleven warriors of Hubur/Azarate]
