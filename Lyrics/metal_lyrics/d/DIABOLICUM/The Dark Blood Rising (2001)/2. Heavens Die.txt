[Sasrof, Nathzhion]

Heavens die
Beyond false illusion of life
Reigns the aeon of thee old
And through veil of dark blood
They will rape this world until
It's black and cold

A plutonium fist in the face of god
Will seal the last chapter of our fate
A death created by hand
But commanded by infernal hate

Moloch
Let Heavens Die
Heavens Die
Let Heavens Die
Heavens Die

[For Moloch And Pazuzu]
