[Sasrof]

The song of suffering
Cries over the (failed) kingdom of man
Across the world
Of the ten angels of light

Exterminate
The moaning breed of god
Brings forth
The ancient sphere of chaos

Which of the false gods can save you now?
Oh, disciple of the lying whore
What was the deceiving love
Compared to the grandeur of hate?

What scripts would have set you free?
Oh, vermit of the loving god
What was the feeble life
Compared to the glory of death?

Eleven blade of darkness
Killed the lambs of the light
Five million men made suns
Gave us the sleep of the endless night

In the winds over a death ridden earth
Sings the sound of desolation
Finally this world got what it deserved
The hatecrowned retaliation

Which of the false gods can save you now?
Oh, disciple of the lying whore
What was the deceiving love
Compared to the grandeur of hate?

What scripts would have set you free?
Oh, vermit of the loving god
What was the feeble life
Compared to the glory of death?

[For the death of this world]
