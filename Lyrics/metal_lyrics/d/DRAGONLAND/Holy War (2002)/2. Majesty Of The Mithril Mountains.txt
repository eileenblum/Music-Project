[Music: Magnusson, Holmlid, Morek Lyrics: Heidgert]

The time of wonders has come
The Dragons soaring high
To Dragonland this story takes you
Come, follow me to that world
The you will finally see
Who'll win, who'll lose this final battle

They live without light
They live without guidance
A hero to lead them they need
They fight without hope
They fight without glory
A lightbearing savior they need

A hero will come with the dawn
To give them the light and the spirit to fight
A hero to banish the darkness
And to bring balance to life

At last he meets his brothers
Down on the mountainslope
Majestic Mithril mountains guide us
The time has come to strike back
To face the enemy
Once more upon the Ivory Plains

But now they have light
They know they have guidance
A hero to lead them has come
They now have the hope
To fight for their freedom
The son of the Dragons has come

A hero has come with the dawn
He's given them light
And the spirit to fight
They're fighting to banish the darkness
And bring back the balance to life

[Solo]

A story will unfold before you
A world full of magic and glory
A tale lasting through generations
Will finally end, end with this war...
