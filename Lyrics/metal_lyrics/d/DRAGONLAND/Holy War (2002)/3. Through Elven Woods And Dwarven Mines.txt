[Music Magnusson, Holmlid Lyrics: Heidgert]

Assembling our forces in our way to the plains
From the Mithril mountains dwarfs join us from their mines

Through dwarven mines I lead an invincible army
Across Dragonland our warcries will be heard

As we journey inward heading for the home of the elves
A forest of magic a place of tranquil glades

Through elven woods nothing can stop us now
Across Dragonland we shall carry on

Axe wielding berserkers, the dwarfs' might will serve the light
Arrowpoints of Mithril, elven scouts always hitting their prey
Axe wielding berserkers, the dwarfs' might will serve the light
Arrowpoints of Mithril, elven scouts always hitting their prey

My knights, my dwarfs, my elves will fight for our dream
The one, the twisted evil one will now be brought down to his knees

Assembled our forces, now we ride to the plains
With power and with magic there is no way we can fail

Through dwarven mines I lead an invincible army
Across Dragonland our warcries will be heard
