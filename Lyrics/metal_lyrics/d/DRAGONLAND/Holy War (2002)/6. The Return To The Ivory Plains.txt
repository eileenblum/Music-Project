[Music: Holmlid, Magnusson Lyrics: Heidgert]

The dawn draws near as we break our
Camp Wiping the dew from my hair
Gripping the hilt of the sword on my hip
Trying to brace myself

Will we break and fall apart?
No, we will crush the hordes once and
For all will we stand victorious?
Yes, we shall win this war in the name of
Light

The view before me seems familiar
Somehow But the memories aren't
mine
thousands and thousands of feet, the
ground's shaking The fate of all will be
decided, the charge begins

The dwarven berserkers charge the horde
Elves cover their backs with arrows
Our steelclad horsemen keep striking the
Flanks It seems we're gonna win

Heads are rolling on the plains
This time we'll end the threat of the
Orcish march The Ivory plains are
drenched in blood
Screams of the dying sends shivers down
My spine

The view before me seems familiar
Somehow Are these memories really
Mine? Thrust and then parry, endless
The battle seems Then finally they're pulling back

For a brief moment all is calm
I give the signal for the hunt to begin
No one of them must survive, stay
alive
They will die in the name of light

The view before me is so unfamiliar
It doesn't match my memories
Thousands and thousands of bodies
Lay still Now we will teach the Dark
Lord to feel fear
