[Music: Holmlid, Magnusson, Heidgert Lyrics: Heidgert]

We have to fight for our freedom and lives
Night and day for light we pray
Who'll stand victorious we are but a few
Riders of light vanquish the night

Holy War

As we thrown into the ocean of fear
Light shall subside to answer our pleas
Thus as we struggle through
This harsh winterstorm
Frozen and cold we will fight on

Soon we will face our foes
Thousands and thousands
They're coming towards us to slay
We will fight 'til the end if we can
Many will die by our hands
But will it be good enough?

This is our holy crusade of light
We have to fight for our rights to live
This is our golden crusade of light
We have to fight to survive

Holy War

[Solo]

We'll engage your blinding rage
And we'll fight like never before
We shall stand for Dragonland
And I swear you will die by my light guided hands

With our powers we will save our world
Glorious light lend us your might
We ride towards the Ivory plains as we chant:
"For Dragonland! For evermore!"

The Lord of Darkness must fall
Fall with my steel though his heart
I shall banish his might
You can run but you can never hide
I'll find you where ever you are
By my sword you will die

This is our holy crusade of light
This is our holy crusade of light
I'm gonna fight you for victory
This is my golden blade made of light
This is the war of a century
Glorious light...
