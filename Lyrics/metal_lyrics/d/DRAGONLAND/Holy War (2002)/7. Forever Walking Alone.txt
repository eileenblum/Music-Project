[Music: Magnusson, Holmild  Lyrics: Magnusson, Heidgert]

Also I travel though the wasteland in my heart As the grievance tears me apart
Thinking of you and the things you meant to me My heart is bleeding, I can't go on

If I could unwind the wheel of time I would have been by your side

If I could turn back time My precious love would be alive

The empty void inside my heart grows day by day I have nowhere to turn to ease the
Pain Remembering the smile you used to give me And your laughter that could light
My way home

If I could unwind the wheel of time I would have been by your side

If I could turn back time I never had a chance to say goodbye

I have cried and mourned my loss My heart keeps beating only for you
Am I strong enough to fight on? Without your love I stand, I stand empty and alone

[Acoustic solo: O.M]
[Solo: N.M]

So my love watch over me now My rage catches fire, I will strike them down
I will avenge you, oh, vengeance so sweet That's my last gift for you
I'm forever walking alone
