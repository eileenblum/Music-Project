"Ascending through time and space
Oh great cosmos, hand me the key
Contemplating the fabric of your architecture
Oh great all, I see the key you hold
Unreachable for me... now
But I know, I know...

Your eternal ocean of infinite blazing lights
The stillness of your empty motions
Waves of eternity soothes unto my shell
Calming me as I see the reflection of my earthly leave
Entwining me with the continuous structure of time
Knowledge of ages compressed into my state of being
Rising into a higher stream of consciousness
Crowning me into the corestones of "heaven"
Facing me with old, embittered entities
Higher beings, driven insane in the mighty river of eternity
Pitiful creatures, I wash them away... falling down they are
No more tyranny,
No more games,
No more... No more
But despite this freeing of the kingdoms of Dragonland
Emptiness I feel, hollow inside I can't take on the throne alone
The sorrow of my dear still rages in my heart...
I'll end my existence, let me pass unto the other side
Where my bleeding heart will find peace in your loving embrace
Thou art my angel, my only one... together we are the KEY

And thus eternity's saga ends..."
