[Bonus Track]

[Limahl cover]

Turn around,
and look at what you see
In her face,
the mirror of your dreams

Make believe I'm everywhere,
living in your eyes
Written on pages
is the answer to our

Neverending story

Reach the stars,
fly a fantasy
Dream a dream,
and what you see will be

Rhymes that keep their secrets,
will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon the rainbow
is the answer to our

Neverending story,
Story

Have no fear,
for she may fade away
In your hands,
for each a new day

Rhymes that keep their secrets,
will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon the rainbow,
Is the answer to our

Neverending story,
Neverending story,
Neverending story
