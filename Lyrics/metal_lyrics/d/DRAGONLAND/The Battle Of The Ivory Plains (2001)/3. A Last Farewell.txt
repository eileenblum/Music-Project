[Music: Holmlid, Magnusson , Lyrics: Magnusson, Heidgert]

"To leave someone you love deeply without hope
of ever seeing each other again, can tear  the hardest heart apart.
But sometimes you must act unselfish and do what you feel
you have to, even if it bears against you...life is not always fair"

[Solo: O.M, N.M]

The time has come for me
To ride on towards the ivory plains
But don't you shed no tears now
Someday i might come home again

I'd give you the moon and sun
If you'd stay with me
If i gave you the world
Would you stay here by my side?

But i might return again
Oh, please stay with me
I must follow the call of my king
Oh, stay with me

My land has now burned down
Blackened soil is all that now remains
The ashes of my home
All that was just slips through my hands

As i gaze into the fire
Loneliness sets in
As the flames fades away
You're disappering from my reach

I have to go
Let me come and ride by your side
My love, my only one
My love, my only one

Heartbreaking melody, enveloped in tragedy
Tears are falling, my destiny's calling
In our darkest hour, oh, never say goodbye
A song for our last farewell, our last farewell

For you i write these words, a song of our last farewell
I know i won't come home again, a last farewell
Heartbreaking melody, enveloped in tragedy
This is our final farewell, our last farewell...
