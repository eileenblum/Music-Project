[Music: Magnusson Lyrics: Magnusson, Heidgert]

"We yearn for the battle and the glory...but my heart doesn't stray from home...
We're joined by the dwarves of the underworld, the elves of
the deepest forests, the highland barbarians and the knights of the most 
radiant orders...
Together we will defend this world...
And victorious we shall be
Ride on..."

We ride into the sunset
And race towards the dawn
We carry on beyond the horizon
Past the night to see the sun again

For the glory, for the splendour
For the honour and the victory

We all hope that someday
We can live in peace again
But for now we must defend
Our people, our homes and our lands

We raise our steel, to the sky
Journey on with hope held high

Carry on, carry on
Brave men you'll fight for your freedom
So Ride on, ride on
Ride on with hope held high

[Solo: N.M, E.H, O.M]

We leave our women and children
We leave them crying behind
But we'll return someday
With happiness and joy

For the glory for the splendour
Journey on with hope held high

Carry on, carry on
Brave men you'll fight for your freedom
So Ride on, ride on
Ride on with hope held high

With hope held high...
