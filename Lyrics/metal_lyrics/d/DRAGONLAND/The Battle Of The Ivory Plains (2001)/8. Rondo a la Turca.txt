[Music: Wolgang Amadeus Mozart ,Arranged by Dragonland]

"Last words of my dear brother...
Seek your origin in the mithril mountain
All answers shall be revealed...
And take care of the ones back home
Before it's too late...
We'll meet again in lands beyond this world
We shall walk the silver fields again..."

[Solo: E.H]
