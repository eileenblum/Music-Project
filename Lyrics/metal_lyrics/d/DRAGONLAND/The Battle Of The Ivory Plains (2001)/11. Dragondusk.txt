[Music: Holmlid]

"I can hardly stay conscious any longer
The world darkens all around me
Even the moon and the stars
Cease their last glimmer of light

I take a last gaze upon this world
The valleys, forests and seas
It will all wither away
As the sun slowly fades

Now i don't care any more
It has proven useless to fight
I yield to my fate
I will just die in peace
And welcome the dark embrace
This is a last goodbye...
Farewell..."
