[Music: Holmlid]

"As the dragons of the dawn spread their wings
And in the first blazing rays of the flowing morninglight
Set flight over oceans of radiant azure blissfull tides
Over majestic mountains of old, mountains of gold
Past heavens breaking through the serenity into clashing lightning and storm
Through crimson horizons bursting with the glory of dusk
To where proud swords are raised high to the sky...
Now let eternity's saga unfold..."
