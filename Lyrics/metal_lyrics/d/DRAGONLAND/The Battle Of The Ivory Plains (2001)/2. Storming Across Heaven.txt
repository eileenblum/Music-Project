[Music:Magnusson,Heidgert Lyrics:Heidgert, Magnusson]

"Welcome to dragonland, A mighty enchanting world
Filled with the most remarkable wonders and the most fearsome of foes!
Once every century the gods play out the good people against the evil hordes
As a little game to satisfy their twisted minds"

Look at the sky as the dragon flies by
Storming across heaven like fire pierce through ice
Joins with the sky in a whirling dance
With bolts of lightning and clouds that cries
In a world where the strong survives the weak
Where the dragons rule as kings

Marching from the north comes the hordes of the night
With hate burning for the armies of the light

Across the open plains (they venture)
And through the darkest and deepest of  forests
Over vast mountains and mighty rivers (and streams)
While their heads are held high their hearts are hanging low

Marching from the south  comes the armies of the light
With fear trembling for the hordes of the night

DRAGONLAND - A war will soon begin
DRAGONLAND - No one knows who will win
DRAGONLAND - On ivory plains they'll stand
Oh,  in dragonland

"The dragonlord circled the plains of ivory and knew
that the battle forthcoming would be heard all across this world"

[Solo: N.M]

On the ivory plains
Where generations have fought, lost and won
A battle that is fought once every century
And thousands of lives will be wasted again

Marching from the north comes the hordes of the night
Marching from the south comes the armies of the light

DRAGONLAND - A war will soon begin
DRAGONLAND - No one knows who will win
DRAGONLAND - On ivory plains they'll stand
Oh, in dragonland

DRAGONLAND - It's where they'll live and die
DRAGONLAND - Why are they pledged  to fight?
The dragonlord spreads his wings
And storms across the sky
