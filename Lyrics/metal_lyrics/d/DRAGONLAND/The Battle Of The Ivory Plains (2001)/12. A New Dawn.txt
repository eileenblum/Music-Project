[Re-release Bonus Track]All is over now
We have lost, freedom's gone
Now we'll live in fear
And the tyrants reign still goes on

As we saw them fight
And our hero fell to the blade of blackest night

Hope is gone as the tyrant lives
And darkness marches on
For century we must endure
Until a new dawn arise again
Until of dragons a hero's born
'Til then we have to struggle to survive

A hundred years have passed
And our hope has now been born
Dragonland will rise
In the name of light, we'll vanquish the night

Hope has come and a hero lives
The night will come to an end
For a century we have endured

From the mountains he'll come to us
Yes, He will bring us the light and thus
He will march us towards to Ivory Plains

For so long we've lived our lives in fear
Struggled, fought to save what we hold dear
And now we finally will live once more

After a dark century
We finally will strike back
The son of the dragons now calls upon us:
"Come! Raise your swords and shields again!"

For so long we've lived our lives in fear
Struggled, fought to save what we hold dear
And now at last we will be free again

From the mountains he'll come to us
Yes, He will bring us the light and thus
He will march us towards the Ivory Plains
Light shall guide us and bring us peace
Our hero's come now we shall be free
For so long we've struggled to survive
