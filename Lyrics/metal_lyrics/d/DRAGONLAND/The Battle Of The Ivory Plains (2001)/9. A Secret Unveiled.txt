[Music: Holmlid , Magnusson ,Kvist Lyrics: Magnusson, Heidgert]

"Now that i've lost my beloved brother, i took his advice
I've searched for the one he claimed to be my true father...the king of kings
The fearsome lord of the mithril mountain the king of dragons!
It was a warm yet expected welcome, i spent many a night there
And found out a great deal of my past, and i was told that there's still a 
chance to
save  our kingdom and world!
The  leader of  the dark hordes the dweller of night, the
destructor of light he must be destroyed in order to scatter the hordes
...he also told me that it is my real brother...
It will be done...i will find you bastard son"

I've wandered for months searching
Time grows short i need an answer
Now i know your name
I have come to cleanse this world
And to rid it all from evil
It has to be done

Now i know the name of the one, the bastard son
It's so clear, Still so much has to be done

I will find you wherever you are
There's nowhere to hide
The power of light guides me right
You sold your soul to learn the secrets of the night
Rejected and cold
May in sickness you dwell

Father tell me what i'm to do
They have burned my home
All i love has died

Follow the path of death, so much pain, all in vain
The road's long and hard, destruction's a horrible sight

I will find you...

[Solo: N.M]

The dark side ravages and plunders still
I must hurry and find an answer  soon

[Solo: E.H]

I will find you...
