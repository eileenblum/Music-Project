Rain's falling down from blackened clouds
Blazing storm of chill
The sky is torn from lightning and from rage
There is no shelter from the wrath
God-forsaken force
I'm standing drenched and soaked in ice so cold

Can it be
It's my fate
All this blazing hate?

See as I fall
So deep into the sky
The spirits are calling my name
They beg me to free them someday
I will be sane

Snow's falling down from clouds above
Tearing down the sky
I must release the spirits now

Raging hate
Is my fate
Is it all too late?

See my scarred body and mind
As I'm laughing at the sky

See as I fall
Into the sky
Lightning is burning my soul

See as I'm thrown
Into the deep blue sky
No spirits are calling my name
I'm begging to be freed from pain
I am no more
