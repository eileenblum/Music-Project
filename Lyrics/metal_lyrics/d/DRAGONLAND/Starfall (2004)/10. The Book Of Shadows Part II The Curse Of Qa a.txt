In my dreams I see a land of might
One ruler, I see the image of myself so bright

Beneath an ocean of sand
I have been buried with my love

I will sleep for ages
But a shadow in my mind
Haunted by the memories
Of what has been left behind
But in thousands of years
You will come here
And release me from my slumber
