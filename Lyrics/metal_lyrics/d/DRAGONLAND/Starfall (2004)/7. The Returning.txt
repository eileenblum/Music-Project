Forever we go into the glorious light
And there is no turning back for us, forever more
Together we rise, we will become strong again
And we'll be forever true or die

When we fight it is for all mankind
For life, forever more

Help us to be the future, to reach the stars
And to be embraced by light
If we just stand together then we might break
The chains, help us fight

Again they shall see we won't fall into eternity
To be gone without a trace

When we fight it is for all mankind
For life, forever more

So please help us to be the future, to reach the stars
And to be embraced by light
If we just stand together then we might break
The chains, help us fight

For the future, now reaching for the stars
So be the light and guide us right
To free us all

Forever we go into the glorious light
And there is no turning back for us, forever more
Again they shall see that we won't fall into eternity
To be gone without a trace

Cause we fight and it's for all mankind
For life, eternally

So please help us to be the future
Reach the sun and to be lit up by light
If we just stand together then be might cheat death
Help us fight
