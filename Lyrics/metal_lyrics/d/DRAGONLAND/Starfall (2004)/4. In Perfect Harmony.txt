From the dark days of my life
I have walked a lonesome road
Just can't reach the light that others have
How is it that I can't see
How to live my life and learn
I've reached the point of no return

I've got to grasp the opportunities
When they're close at hand
And I've got to realize
My memories must burn

Set me free and let me see
All the beauty in this world
Give me hope, make me believe
That I can change this world and be
Forever free in harmony with life

Sometimes errors I have done
When my judgement has been wrong
As my mind's been set my heart's been gone
I have travelled by myself
Like a lone wolf I have strayed
I have to open up my eyes

I've got to grasp the opportunities
When they're close at hand
And I've got to realize
My memories must burn

Now I can see
The dark clouds are gone
My mind has been set free
No more I'll stray

I've got to grasp the opportunities
When they're close at hand
And I've got to realize
My memories must burn

Set me free and let me see
All the beauty in this world
Give me hope, make me believe
That I can change this world and be
Forever free in harmony with life
