The heavens are burning down tonight
To the end of the world we have arrived
But as constellations pass us by
Civilizations shall once more rise to die

Evolution and insanity
We've been building our own destiny
We can no longer see the lights inside
Evolution and insanity
We've been building our own destiny
There's no reasons left behind

There's no way to turn the tide
If we don't care to walk that extra mile
Mother Earth is losing all her pride
We must remember that life is more than just a file

So hold on to me for one last time
The sun ceases to shine and slowly goes down
Don't let me go, we're all we've left now
As this world goes down
Down into flames

Ash falling down, rain burns my skin
Rivers run black and the trees are withering away

So hold on to me for one last time
The sun ceases to shine and slowly goes down
Don't let me go, we're all we've left now
As this world goes down
Down into flames
