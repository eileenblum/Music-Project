Astray I have wandered
I have been haunted
By the fear that's been holding me down

But the heavens sing your silent cry
And they whisper

A sleepless starlight
To grant you a world beyond your sight
Hear the calling of

The sign of truth - starfall lights your eyes
The wish it hides - is in your mind
The hope of life - when astral angels cry
Truth and lies - starfall eyes

I hear the calling of a thousand lights
Sing to me
They've been singing to me

A sleepless starlight
To grant you a world where you belong
A world beyond your mind

Forever, this is the moment of surrender to
To the calling of

The sign of truth - starfall lights your eyes
The wish it hides - is in your mind
The hope of life - when astral angels cry
Truth and lies - starfall eyes

Sign of truth
Wish it hides
Hope of life
Starfall eyes
