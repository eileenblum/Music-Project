For so long have travelled, I have fought
Now the road is at an end
I've climbed the highest mountains
Seen the sea beyond the hills, I'm alone with a dream

I have to go
Release all my bonds
Forever I'll search

Oh, I can't go on, the last drop of my strength
Silently falls to the ground
No, I just can't break, I have to keep on going to the end
I am alone with a dream

I have to go
Release all my bonds
Forever I'll search
For my own dream

Now I hope to see what
What I will become
If I see with my own eyes
This is my time
To overcome my fears
Doubt has me in its grasp
I must believe that my wish
Will come true in the end
It has to end

I've fought my own thoughts
I have struggled to keep my head clear
I have vanquished the night
Clouding my sight now I know
Now I know...

For so long I have journeyed, I have strayed
Now the road is at an end

Now all my bonds
Are gone, I'm released
Forever I'll search
I've my own dream

Now I can see what
What I have become
I see with my own eyes
Now it's my time
No longer drowned by fear
No, there isn't any doubt
I just believed that my wish
Would come true in the end
This is my end
