I never thought that I would see the truth behind the lie
So now I've opened my eyes
Now I must find the reason
I leave my sanity behind

Madness took my mind

Someday you'll see and you will believe me
I'm the one who will set you free
So open your mind and rid this world of insanity
From the vanity

I stare out into nothing, thinking what we have done
Just don't understand why all this came to be
What have we done to be to be rulers of all
How it tears my mind apart

Someday you'll see and you will believe me
I'm the one who will set you free
So open your mind and rid this world of insanity
From the vanity

The bruises on my wrists are bleeding more and more
I'm pulling harder trying to break free
Suddenly I realize I can't move
Thinking of the good times as I am falling asleep
