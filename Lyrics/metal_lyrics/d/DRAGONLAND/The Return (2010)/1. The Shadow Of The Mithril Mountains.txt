"I speak to you now,
sons and daughters of dragonland,
after what may seem to some
like a lifetime of silence
these words are not my own
for I utter the mind of the 'sidian'
now that his voice can no longer
carry the faith of this withering race.

I bring hope for all creatures,
our once glorious lands;
for I speak about the one man
that still has the power to save our world,
and what we must do to find him."

Dark rumors speak of an evil
A shadow that devours your soul
Rising from the fear
that was one with all

Racing the horse up the mountain
to grant them the heart, he was born
If he were the one
He was destiny's son
Now the prophecy's undone

Devious
They say his return is glorious
Hear his name
Feel the changes he will make

He will rule supreme
That I know, I've seen it in my dreams
Our world, and what will be
The true hope lies beyond the sea

To light our path
and keep us from harm

"Once a mortal man, sane,
ascended to godhood only to cast it away
and become one with the very fabric of the cosmos
A century of solitude drove him mad."

Awaken from a century's slumber
to spread fear across the Ivory Plains
A malicious return
Now the feats we must earn
Or dragonland will burn

Treacherous
They say his return is glorious
Fear his name
Dragonland won't be the same

He will rule supreme
that I know, I've seen it in my dreams
Our world, and what will be
The true hope lies beyond the sea

To light our path
and keep us from harm

[Solo]

Devious
They say his return is glorious
Hear is name
Feel the changes he will make

He will rule supreme
that I know, I've seen it in my dreams
Our world, and what will be
The true hope lies beyond the sea

To light our path
and keep us from harm
