[Music: Holmlid, MÃ¶rck; Lyrics: MÃ¶rck]

[The Eldest Council of Anno CXLIII A.W.F II, the voice of Duviel Le'erevan, speaking for her father, Elsydeon Le'erevan]

"I speak to you now, sons and daughters of Dragonland, after what may seem to some like a lifetime of silence. These words are not my own, for I utter the mind of Elsydeon, now that his voice can no longer carry the fate of this withering race. I bring hope for all creatures of our once glorious lands. For I speak about the one man who still has the power to save our world - and of what we must do to find him"

Dark rumours speak of an evil
A shadow that devours your soul
Rising from a being that was one with all
Raised in the halls of the mountains
To grant them a hope he was born
Ephemereal one, he was destiny's son
Now the prophecy is undone

Devious - they say his return is glorious
Hear his name, fear the changes he will make

He will rule supreme
That I know, I've seen it in my dreams
Our world at war will be
But true hope lies beyond the sea
To light our path and keep us from harm

Awaken from a century's slumber
To spread fear across the ivory plains
A malicious return, now the fates we must turn
Or Dragonland will burn

Treacherous - they say his return is glorious
Fear his name, Dragonland won't be the same

He will rule supreme
That I know, I've seen it in my dreams
Our world at war will be
But true hope lies beyond the sea
To light our path and keep us from harm

[Solo: MÃ¶rck]

Devious - they say his return is glorious
Hear his name, fear the changes he will make

He will rule supreme
That I know, I've seen it in my dreams
Our world at war will be
But true hope lies beyond the sea
To light our path and keep us from harm
