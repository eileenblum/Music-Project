[Music: Holmlid, MÃ¶rck; Lyrics: MÃ¶rck]

["The journey across the Great Sea had lasted for nearly two weeks, when the islander and his companions felt an ever increasing strength of wind. It was not long before the fresh breeze had turned into salty lashes upon the ship's hull, rocking the vessel as easily as a clam shell in a maelstrom. The darkest clouds filled the entire horizon, and with a crack of lightning the mast was broken into a million splinters and the tormented sailors cast overboard. It was two long days and moonless nights before the glaring sun once more cast its golden rays upon the sole person remaining afloat, desperately clinging to floating wooden debris"]

With this dawning clarity
A calm and vast serenity I see
Into this pale infinity
I'm drifting

Spirits of the sea
Streams reached down to me
Visions in a dream
Spared me

With the fury of a storm
A raging, darkened majesty sent me
Into a sunken destiny
Azure divinity

Spirits of the sea
Streams reached down to me
Visions in a dream
Spared me

[solo: MÃ¶rck]

[solo: Lindskog]

Spirits of the sea
Harken unto me
The tempest made me see
What must be
