[Music: Holmlid, MÃ¶rck; Lyrics: MÃ¶rck]

["The coast of the Southlands stretches countless miles, with jagged rocks like a Dragon's teeth, hopeless marshlands and many pirate coves of sea-borne bandits. But such was not the sight that the Islander saw when he finally laid his weary eyes upon dry land. The fabled beaches just a day's ride south of Westmar with their soft dunes seemed so much like those he had left at home, or even of the Ivory Shores which his uncle had once seen in his youth. Utterly exhausted when he touched upon firm ground and still mourning his lost friends, he could still barely contain himself. For he was well aware what mighty a sight and many-spired radiancy that lay to the north; the jewel of the west, the pride of men - the Royal City of Westmar"]

I raise up my head and gaze upon silvery seashores
with the sand on my feet and with the sun on my back
For days the coast leads my journey shining in the misty dew I see

There, a thousand spires
Glowing like fire in the sun
I see them rising o'er these open plains
And I know I shall remember forever
how I saw a thousand towers white

When young I was told
Of a city of might and of honour
An empire's crown, as powerful as it was feared
And now as I stand before her
I set my eyes upon a waking dream

There, a thousand spires
Gleaming like ice in the sun
I see them rising o'er these open plains
And I know I shall remember forever
how I saw a thousand towers white

Mirrorlike gates stretch before me
blazing serene in the dawn
Split open for vast lines of many men
I gaze beyond in bewilderment

Shattered hearts and dreams
crushed by grievous tyranny
Crumbling homes and screams
among corrupted industry

[Solo: MÃ¶rck]

A sinister reign
brother is turned against brother
irrational fear enslaved the dwarves and the elves

What lies beyond such opression?
shining towers cast a shade on me

There, a thousand spires
Glowing like fire in the sun
but I see no honour in these broken men
yet I know I will remember forever
how I saw a thousand towers white
