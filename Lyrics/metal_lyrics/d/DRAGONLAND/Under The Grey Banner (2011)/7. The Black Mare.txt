[Music: Holmlid, MÃ¶rck; Lyrics: MÃ¶rck]

["After spending a night among cheerful song and many a laughter at the Inn of Eamon Bayle, the Islander and the Elf woman, whose destinies were now closely entwined, set out to the east away from pursuing men and towards the glades of her people. Like a horse that great elven kings would mount before men had not yet named a chieftain, the black mare now carried them in restless flight across the Southland Dales"]

Crack of thunder, sound of rain across the endless fields
as we speed towards the night upon a steed that never yields
Black as the night, swift as the wind and eyes of emerald green
In restless flight our journey takes us further east

The seventh day we reach the west trail
through the Nethermoor
guides us through the mist
Across the river past the grey stones of
Ne'anthor, stars shine our way

Journey into far away
and to forgotten lands
and here by my side
she will ride there with me
To the home of her kind

I see creatures from old stories I thought make believe
Crawling in the shades with thousand eyes they gaze upon me
She lifts her head up like she senses unseen enemies
In the black of night a shadow watches over me

On the second moon we set out east for Val'inthor
Where her kindred dwell
We pass the mighty ruined citadels of ancient lore
The moon lights our way

Journey into far away
and to forgotten lands
and here by my side
she will ride there with me
To the home of her kind

[Solo: MÃ¶rck]

[Solo: Holmlid]

Ghostly specters, faded wanderers that gone before
reveals the passage through the river to the northern shore
Something dwells within the dark I sense we're not alone
though I know it cannot pass beyond the warding stones

before the break of fall we stand before the sacred realm
where her kindred dwell
we make camp in crumbling temples by the raging ford
light shine our way

Journey into far away
and to forgotten lands
and here by my side
she will ride there with me
She's the queen of her kind
