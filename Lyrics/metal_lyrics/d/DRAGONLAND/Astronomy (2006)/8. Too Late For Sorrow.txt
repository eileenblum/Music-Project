Show me, will you lead the way
To a place where I will feel this pain?
Tell me you will always be by my side
and wait for this final moment.

Close your eyes and hear my whisper
longing for the sun

'cause I live my life
I live my life
Lost all of my hope
and I'm fearing tomorrow.
where will I be trying to see?
but it's too late.
So now I know that I'm alone
and it's too late for sorrow.

Trust me, it is my advice
don't look back in time
it's hard to realise.

So hold me
And I will always be by your side
and wait for this final moment.

I close my eyes and hear your whisper
calling for a sign

I live my life
lost all of my hope
and I'm fearing tomorrow.
Where will I be trying to see?
But it's too late.
So now I know that I'm alone
and it's too late for sorrow.

I lived my life
lost all of my hope
now it's too late

I live my life
lost all of my hope
and I'm fearing tomorrow.
(For I need you, I need you)
Where will I be trying to see?
(Longing to see)
But it's too late for sorrow.
(But it's too late)
