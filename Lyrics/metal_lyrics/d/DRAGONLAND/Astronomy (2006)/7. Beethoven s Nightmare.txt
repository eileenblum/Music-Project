[Holmlid, MÃ¶rck, Beethoven]

Twilight, candlelit walls
A strong crescendo
Highlights the lonely calls
From my piano

Melody, come to me
sing your silent voice
Remedy my envy
Bring me one last choice

Why, why can't you bring me to find?
To clear your sound
no wayfarer is blind

See my hands
Conducting a nightmare
The symphony of a tragedy
So great it devours me
These notes are just fantasy

Peretual dream won't let go of me
I struggle to live
without the notion of a sound
that could open my mind

moonlight, make me conceive
a slow sonata
Midnight, the dead will grieve
to this dark cantata

The detestable dance to my score
they hear my cries
Your guidance I implore

See my hands
Constructing a nightmare
the symphony of a universe
So vast it devours me
These nights are just fantasy

Celestial beam, help me to see
I struggle to live
without the notion of a sound
That could open my mind

[Solo: MÃ¶rck, Magnunsson]

Into a unending sorrow
A festival of horror
An orchestra of the undead

So bright my destiny was
Golden future
Inside shadows amass
Nocturnal rapture

Melody, come to me
Sing your silent voice
Remedy my envy
Bring me one last choice

Why can't you bring me to find?
to hear your sound
No wayfarer is blind

See my hands
Conducting a nightmare
The beauty of a melody
Is all that inspires me
to write my last symphony

Perpetual dream
never lets go of me
I struggle to live
without the notion of a sound
That could (have) opened my mind
