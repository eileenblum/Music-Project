[MÃ¶rck, Holmlid]

Just one
One more and I'll give in
Say why you stalk me
Everlasting crave

Fly through the light
In nethern realms you will find
No more deception
(Exception)

Now save your pride
Walk this line
And I'll be your guide
See your final hope
Is fading with the light
That blinds your eyes

Gaze high
And see why you will know
In every vision
There's a truth that hides

Fly through the light
In nether realms you will find
Your right direction - perfection

Now save your pride
Walk this line
Towards the other side
See your final hope
Is fading with the light
That blinds your eyes

[Solo: MÃ¶rck]

Fly through the light
In never realms you will find
Your right direction - perfection
