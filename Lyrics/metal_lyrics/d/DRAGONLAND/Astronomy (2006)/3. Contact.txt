[Holmlid, MÃ¶rck]

A cryptic equation
of a pulsating light
An unearthly riddle
from beyond the starlit sky

Message of unknown design
Heavenly but non - divine
Sent by intelligent minds
An echo through space and time

Fractal figures, deciphered lines
Stellar visit is nigh

[Chorus:]
See the fire in the cloudless night
Bright reflection of lights in my eyes
Now we will see
will our contact be
salvation from afar
a guiding star

[Solo: Holmlid]

A cold observation
of systematical eyes
Our demeanor transfigured
A calculated demise

Contact with alien life
Heavenly but with non - divine
Communication with cosmic minds
that navelled through space and time

[Chorus]

[Solo: MÃ¶rck, Holmlid, Magnusson,MÃ¶rck]

Complete fulfilment of ancient signs
A swift destruction by higher minds

See the fire in the cloudless night
Bright reflection of lights in my eyes
Now we will see
that our contact will be
destruction from afar
one final war
