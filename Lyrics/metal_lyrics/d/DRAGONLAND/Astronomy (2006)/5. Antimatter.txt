Radioactive decay
A separation of fragile cycles
Decelerating our age
Nothing stands in my way and the universe

Before the stars were born
From matter it was told

Reach out you will see
What science won't believe
A mirror for this world
Through gateways you will pass
Inverted human mass

There will be no return
And soon you will learn
Now follow me

Before the stars were born
From matter it was told

Reach out you will see
What science won't believe
A mirror for this world
Through gateways you will pass
Inverted human mass

Leave this heart
To a blight
With shadows lost inside
A vision of empty light
Abandon your sight

Before this dream was born
My vision was forlorn

None believe but now
Behold what can't be seen
The mirror of a dream
There will be no return

So reach out, you will learn
