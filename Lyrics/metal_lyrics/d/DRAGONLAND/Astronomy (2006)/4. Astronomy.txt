[music: MÃ¶rck, Holmlid, Lyrics: MÃ¶rck, Jake E (Dream land vocal)]

I'm getting closer
In a higher ground
My destination
Lies beyond the sun

Not afraid of failure
to crash and burn
If you're not living
you will never learn

constellations far
revealing my destiny
Astronomy
there among the star

Like a higher conscience
living in my mind
You're always with me
'til the end of time

It is there before me
Undisguised
No hesitation
I'm on the rise

Constellations far
Revealing my agony
Astronomy
There among the star

"A life without strife is a moonless night"
Astronomy
"Ascend to sky of endless light"
Astronomy

[Solo: MÃ¶rck, Holmlid]

Constellations far
Revealing my destiny
Astronomy
There among the star

"A life without strife is a moonless night"
Astronomy
"Ascend to sky of endless light"
Astronomy
"Ascend to sky of endless light"
Astronomy
