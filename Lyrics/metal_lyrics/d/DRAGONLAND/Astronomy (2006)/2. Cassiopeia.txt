Beautiful queen of the waters
Borne by celestial mother
Sublime astrological divinity

Punished for vain intervention
She sacrificed god-like ascension
Stripped of olympian serenity

Solar rays will carry me far away from here
Take... me... to my journey's end

[Chorus:]
Hear a goddess cry
A silent hopeless sight
From a sanctum divine!

(from the stars she still whispers
Envied among all her sisters
Entwined in a kingdom of infinity)

The tears of an astral descension
Derived from her moonlit dimension
A star that is fading to obscurity

So my wings will carry me far away from home
Bring... me... to my final rest

[Chorus]

Hear a goddess cry
When astral angels die
In a sanctum divine

[Chorus]

Hear a goddess cry
When astral angels die
In a sanctum divine
