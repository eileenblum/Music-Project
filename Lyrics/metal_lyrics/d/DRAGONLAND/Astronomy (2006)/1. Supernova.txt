[Music: Holmlid, MÃ¶rck  Lyrics: MÃ¶rck]

Do you believe in powers extreme?
Bewildering majesty
Can you perceive a vision supreme?
Eruption serene

Grim destiny
Infinity
Radiant intensity
Ethereal sphere
Future severe
Benevolent fear

Into its fortune bestowed
Marvel and let it explode!
To the inferno we go

[Chorus:]
Detonate the sun
And soar into the supernova
Now it has begun
A solar mass undone

Say, can you feel
Destruction surreal
Deadly calamity
A final demise
In godly disguise
Now will arise

Head to the wisdom of old
Unleash a glory untold
To the inferno we go

[Chorus]

[Solo: MÃ¶rck]
[Solo: Holmlid]
[Solo: Magnusson]

Head to its fortune bestowed
Marvel and let it explode
To the inferno we go

[Chorus]
