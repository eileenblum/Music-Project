People beware, they are here.

They warned us, stay far from here.
A quarantine, do not come near.
With flashing lights and thundering guns.
This horrid fate is everyone's.

This is the end, but we cannot die.
Pick up your arms and fight for your lives.
Death is no option, we shall not fall.
Avenging the dead, we'll give it our all.

I will stay alive, you will not survive. (x2)

I have seen you arise right before my eyes.
I put a bullet in your head,
Now, bitch, you stay dead.

This is how your death will be.
Without cause or sympathy.
Take your last breath tenderly.
Let your life go angrily.

Get out of town, run for your lives.
Don't dare delay, fight for today.
