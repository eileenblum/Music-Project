Help me,
Oh, please save me from this tragedy.
A liar's words never came true.
But in the end, what's new?
I came to you for misled guidance.

In return, I get nothing.
But what's new?

I turn my back you turn your side.
Just keep on running, run and hide.
I keep my word you don't keep yours.
Just keep pushing, make it worse.

Can't you see what you've caused?
A tide of lies overcomes me,
I'm carried away.
I've become the lost.

I can't believe, the years.
I've wasted on you.

I turn my back you turn your side.
Just keep on running, run and hide.
I keep my word you don't keep yours.
Just keep pushing, make it worse.

No, but I've showed you,
That this, that this was all your fault.

I turn my back you turn your side.
Just keep on running, run and hide.
I keep my word you don't keep yours.
Just keep pushing, make it worse.
(Just run away, conceal your shame.
Too weak to stay.)
