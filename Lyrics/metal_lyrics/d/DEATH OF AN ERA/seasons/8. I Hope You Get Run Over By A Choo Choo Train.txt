I've never seen it so bad,
There's blood on the ground.
It's a massacre.
I've never seen it so bad,
There's blood on my hands.
I'm a murderer.

One two three,
They've found the street.
Four five six,
They're at the door.
Seven eight nine,
I hear their footsteps.
With guns and shackles,
They have come for me.

I've never seen it so bad,
There's blood on the ground.
It's a massacre.
I've never seen it so bad,
There's blood on my hands.
I'm a murderer.

Only knowing hate,
I have sealed my fate.
Feeling regret,
I must face the end.
