I've spent these last two years,
In more hotel rooms, than a whore.
Looking back has never been an option.
Sometimes I run, others I hide.

Don't touch me,
Don't even come close.
You don't know what I've been through.
Don't touch me now, Don't even come close.
You don't know what I'm capable of.

For two damn years, this fear keeps me,
Far from here, I'll show you now.
What it means, to be afraid.
This neverending nightmare.

I promise my eyes are open wide.
Where do you go with nowhere to hide?
