In all my life, something I never foresaw.
Was a demon, a demon just like you.
With two faces, but with such beauty and grace.

But when they told me, I could not believe my ears.
No disappointment could have ever prepared,
Prepared me for this.

What are you trying to prove,
Even your friends don't believe in you.
Take a good look at what you turned into.

I don't know how much closer to the edge I can get.

Thanks to the art of deception,
Fill your emptiness with words from others just like you.

Look at your life,
Is this all that you're worth?
Look at your life,
Do you want something more?

What are you trying to prove,
Even your friends don't believe in you.
Take a good look at what you turned into.

It was the first time,
That I saw her pretty face.
It was the first time,
That I Saw that smile.
And now I realize.
She played all of her angles.
