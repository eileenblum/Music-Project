You waste your life on nothing,
On nothing and everything.
This dead routine has taken its toll on your mind.

I wash my hands of you, vermin,
And your pathetic lives. [x2]

You wander in a mindless race for next to nothing,
A doctrine taught to you, since your birth.

One day youâll wake up,
And youâll realize that thereâs nothing left,
And everything youâve worked for is a lie and really meaningless.
Itâs clear, a testimony of how ignorant you are,
Walking through your daily lives,
And missing whatâs before your eyes.

I can show you actual life.
I can bring vitality.

Wake up to your surroundings,
And know how it feels to be alive.
Keep marching towards your death.
Thereâs nothing left to see.
Keep marching towards your downfall.
Thereâs nothing left to see.

Youâre only a simple insect,
Devoid of humanity.
Youâre caught in a constant struggle,
Its name is complacency. [x2]

Fuck.

Society speaks only lies. [x2]
