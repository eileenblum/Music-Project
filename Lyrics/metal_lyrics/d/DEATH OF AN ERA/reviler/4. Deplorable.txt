I watched you turn your back on us,
Betraying your best friends and their trust.
Your actions will have consequences,
In time you will pay for your offenses.
You will see no sympathy.

Open your eyes and see only lies.
Open your ears and take in your fears.

You threw it all away,
And now there is nothing left.
Nothing left but shame.

Your lies are fucking poison,
And your word is worthless.
Respect has lost all meaning,
Pay your price in blood.
Your time has come you'll see,
And now you're dead to me.
Vengeance is short in coming,
And your best chance is running.

You pathetic waste,
Writhe in hellish pain.

You threw it all away,
And now there is nothing left.
Nothing left but shame.

So save me from your lies. [x2]

Your lies are fucking poison,
And your word is worthless.
Respect has lost all meaning,
Pay your price in blood tonight.

I watched you turn your back on us,
Betraying your best friends, and their trust.
Your actions will have consequences,
In time you will pay for your offenses.
You will see no sympathy.

And now we've come to an end,
And we've a message to send.
To the shit you've become,
This fucking friendship in done.
