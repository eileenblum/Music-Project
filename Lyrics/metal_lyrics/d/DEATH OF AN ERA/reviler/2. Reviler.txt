You speak your mind but no one cares.
Self righteous attitudes don't amount to anything.
You think yourself, something of worth.
But in the end, you'll die alone like everyone else.
Form your stances on prejudice.
We'll see who's left behind to wallow in their shit.

Take your thoughts.
Die with them.

I don't care about what you think you know.
My life is not for you.
When the smoke clears, we'll see if you kept your word.
All will see, see your lies.
Time will pass, your words will fall on deaf ears.
Because you are a fake.

What does your life have to show for? [x4]
(Shut your fucking mouth,
No one would even care if you died.) [x2]

You should learn to bite your tongue before I cut it out. [x2]
