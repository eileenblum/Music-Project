Your faith will cease.

Your church was invented to control it's people.
In the name of something greater than itself,
It demands your blind faith.
But nothing ever comes with ease.

Their lies will hide contradiction.
You must choose to see through the lines.

An institution founded on fear.
Obey a god or suffer so-called righteous wrath.
Your bible leaves too much to question.
There fails to be consistency.

What kind of god would you seek
that only brought destruction on his child?
And a jealous god who turned his back on man?

Where was your god,
When his own people bowed to their knees
And died at the hands of Hitler?
Where was your god,
When thousands of Christians were tortured and killed
At the hands of the inquisition?

Throughout the ages,
God has only shown us tribulation and fear.
Omnipotent, he won't save you.
God looks on carelessly as the whole world burns.

Tell me where your god is.
Tell me how he's worked in your life.
All I see is a path of destruction and unanswered prayers.

I've stood here idle and said nothing,
For far too long.
I'm here to warn you of a church that's done you wrong.
When everything falls down around you
And there's nothing left,
You will remember my words
And you will pay them heed.
