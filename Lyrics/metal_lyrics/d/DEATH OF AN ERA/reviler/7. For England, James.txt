Your words are meaningless,
When no one can hear you scream.
Your apologies and excuses don't lessen this tragedy.

I will have your life in the palm of my hand.

You've brought this hell down on you.
And I smell your flesh boil.
You open your mouth to beg.
I rip the throat from your neck.
Your form now lies dismembered, unrecognizable.
The end of you will be seen as a blessing to all man kind.

I have brought your entire pathetic existence to a halt.

Your words are meaningless,
When no one can hear you scream.
Your apologies and excuses don't lessen this tragedy.

I'll sleep easier tonight,
Covered in your fucking blood.
In your blood, I will sleep [x2]

You're wasting your time,
If you think you'll make it out alive.
Your screaming only makes it that much sweeter. [x2]
And if you think there's any escape, you are mistaken.
The only way you'll leave here tonight is dead.

Your spilt blood flows like a river down my thirsty hands.
This lust satisfied only by your mutilation. [x2]
