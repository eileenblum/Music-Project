With this world,
Enveloped in a wretched disease,
A virus that brought demise.

Hunting the beasts by day,
A cure I seek in their own blood.
This task, appointed to me.
I cannot fail,
Because everything will go to hell and perish.

I cannot fail,
Even if the world is falling down around me.
I cannot fail.

Abominations from the depths,
These creatures, once my family.
And now in my hands rests the future of the human race.
Oh god, I find myself in fear of my own shadow.
When will this end?

Hunting the beasts by day,
A cure I seek in their own blood.
This task, appointed to me.
I cannot fail.

This world is mine.

They will know my wrath and hate,
As their hideous lives I take. [x2]
