You feed your bullshit to the weak.

You've been given a voice, but only use it for your gain.
So eager for guidance, kids believe anything you say.

So think before you speak.

Ostentatious, you need the lime light.
You feed on others' praise.

You peddle lies, with only selfishness in mind,
Using your influence as a way to profit.

You've fed your bullshit to the weak,
to the weak for too long,
Thinking your status makes you like a god,
Not held accountable and blamed for nothing.
This is a call for you to fucking change.

You're such a fake,
You're nothing but a lying cheap facade.
A fucking masquerade
You've built your career on people's pain, fears, and insecurities.

Naive, they see you as someone they should trust.
But you repay them with words, as empty as the life you lead.

Filth.

Though it can hurt, it is your duty to expose the truth,
Your feel good lyrics only serve to bring us further down.
You're just a man, given a chance to speak out,
But without your fans, no one would know your name.

Idols will fall.
And to the people you've deceived,
Some fault lies with you, an inability to see.

You are too blind to see.

You've been given a voice, but only use it for your gain.
So eager for guidance, kids believe anything you say.
