Justice will prevail.
America,
Look at yourself.
What have you become?

Land of the free, granting freedom only to the rich.
Tax incentives flow like champagne to their open mouths.
The weak and weary, traded as slaves, just to further their capital gains.

They leave so little for the rest,
Holed up in castles, they turn their backs on fellow man,
And raise the prices.
Weâre here to take back the world.
We are stronger,
than the leaders that are failing us.
and we will stand, all together,
we are united and weâre not afraid.
We are not afraid.
We the people, gave you your power,
and itâs ours to take back.
Weâre taking it back

We must bring down the Federal Reserve.

Our treasury is run by bank executives privately,
the central banks, the central cause of all our poverty.
They print money that is backed by nothing,
then charge us interest at a ânominalâ fee.
