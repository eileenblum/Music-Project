Hot off the printing presses,
Your propaganda.
Swallow it down with your morning coffee.
Digest the news in the American way.
God bless the motherfucking USA.

God bless the motherfucking USA.

They lie,
And you eat it up.

Turn off your TV screen.
They make a fool of you.
Every word is a misrepresentation.
Turn off your TV screen.
They make a fool of you.
When you don't know anything that is happening,
The government gets away with fucking everything.

This is
Revolution,
And it won't be televised.

They fuck up every day,
And we can't know it,
But they're allowed to watch our every move.
Our privacy, their liability.
Shut down the cameras.

Fuck you big brother.

They're safe when the people stay absent minded.
We've got to wake up.

It's time
For change.
We've got to wake up.

We're got to wake up.

We're overcome by a blinding darkness.
Our leadership's a ghost.
Insidiously it takes our freedoms, one by one.

We must fight for a reformation,

Of turn our backs and we'll lose it all. [x4]

God bless the motherfucking USA.
