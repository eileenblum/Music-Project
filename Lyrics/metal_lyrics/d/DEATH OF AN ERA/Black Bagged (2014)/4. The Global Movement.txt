We will not be ignored.
Your reign of shadows is over.
We will expose you to the world for what you really are.

You sit so high on your towers built on the backs of man,
Sadistic tyrants consuming the earth we call our home.
You've sat and watched the world burn,
Now we will drive you out.
We will drive you out.

Everything we've worked for, as a people, as a nation, as a world,
is halted by your greed, our true potential, now a blur.
We will no longer keep silent. We're coming for you and pack of wolves.
We, as a global movement, are denying you and your right to power.

We will bring you to your knees.
Bring you to your knees. [x2]

Your time has come, we've opened blinded eyes.
This is the end of your America.
We've swallowed your words for so long, so now, listen to mine.
We stand as one, against your one percent.

We don't forget, we don't forgive.
We are Legion.
We are legion.

This ends with your final breath,
Our hands wrapped around your neck.
We will not be ignored.

Your reign of shadows is over.
We will expose you to the world for what you really are.

You sit so high on your towers built on the backs of man,
Sadistic tyrants consuming the earth we call our home.
You've sat and watched the world burn,
Now we will drive you out.
