We're getting sicker everyday
And take a pill to fix it.
They say it helps, but we are not
Even close to healthy.
The shit they feed us, we shouldn't even call it food.
It's packed with GMO's that they would never touch themselves.

Eat up, Eat up, motherfuckers.
It's dinner time in the US.

All hail Monsanto.

Doctors prescribe us a pill that never makes us better.
They'll never cure us, the money's only in the treatment.
Their diagnosis designed to keep us under their hand.
They keep us ill and we keep them rich.

We keep them rich.

Please, have some humanity for your own.
You hold our lives in your very hands.
You can give us all a chance to fight.
Please, we need a physician
That cares more about
His patients than the money in his bank account.

Food is health care.
Your medication doesn't heal.
It's sick care. [x2]

White coats invent a new disease
And diagnose the masses.
We turn and cry for sweet relief,
Pharmaceutics meet us.
Prescription poison,
Obey and take your daily dose.
Continue to just eat the shit that ailed you from the start.

Please, have some humanity for your own.
You hold our lives in your very hands.
You can give us all a chance to fight.
Please, we need a physician
That cares more about

His patients than the money in his bank account.
