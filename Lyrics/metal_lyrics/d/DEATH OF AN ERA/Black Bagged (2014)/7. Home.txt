Wise men say,
That home is where the heart is.
And if thatâs true, 
Then I havenât been home in ages.
And it all just feels the same, without you.
I drive these never ending roads, 
They bring me back,
They bring me back.
And if youâd only asked me,
Iâd be coming home tonight.
But we both know youâll stay silent,
So Iâll be sleeping alone tonight.
They say time heals all wounds,
But every day, without you, is a knife of its own.
Theyâre digging deeper and deeper, 
And I can barely find the strength
To live this life not satisfied.
You Said,
That we were never meant to be. 
But Iâm finding that hard to believe when youâre a constant in my mind. 
Iâve tried to run, Iâve tried to hide, 
I even put a fucking ocean between us,
5,000 miles, but you never left my side.
And it all just feels the same, without you.
I drive these never ending roads, 
They bring me back,
They bring me back.
And if youâd only ask me,
Iâd be coming home tonight.
But we both know youâll stay silent,
So Iâll be sleeping alone tonight.
Getting over you was, 
The hardest thing that I could never do.
The last moment that we had
Is all that I can see,
Me watching you walk away.
You walked away 
I could never forget you.
And it all just feels the same, without you.
I drive these never ending roads,
They bring me back,
They bring me back.
And if youâd only ask me,
Iâd be coming home tonight.
But we both know youâll stay silent,
So Iâll be sleeping alone tonight.ï»¿
