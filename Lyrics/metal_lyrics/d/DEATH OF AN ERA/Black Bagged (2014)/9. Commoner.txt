United States,
Look at the wreck that you've become.
You lack
Consciousness.

You've lost yourself in your own negligence.
Can't pry your mind from social media.

Now listen up.

Put down your cell phone,
Take a fucking look around.
You're turning into a reproduction,
Slave to empty trends.
You're still alive,
But dead inside.
Your aspiration, just exist to exist.

Embrace a change
And overcome your apathy.
Be honest with yourself,
There's so much more
That you could be.

You are not beautiful the way you are,
Instead a vile piece of shit born of complacency.

Fuck you
And your indifference.

Wake up and smell the death on your skin.
You live your life without a fucking cause.

You died the day you gave your dreams away.
The walking dead all work a 9 to 5.

Embrace a change
And overcome your apathy.
Be honest with yourself,
There's so much more
That you could be.

You're still alive.
