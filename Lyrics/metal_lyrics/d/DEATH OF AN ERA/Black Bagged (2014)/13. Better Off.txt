The day you were born,
You became a victim.
A cruel and heartless world
Looked at you with calloused eyes.

Lost and discouraged,
Childhood in flames.
Fear and doubt are your mindset.
You can't escape.
Live your life afraid.
You're always so afraid.

Transcend the pain,
As the world beats you down.
You'll find your own direction.
Without them, without them,
You'll find a better home.
Without them, without them,
You're better off alone.

You'll see social norms.
You must rise above them.
Reject naivety.
Don't let society define you.

Open your eyes to
All that you can do.
Be sincere.
Shed your fear.
Move on without your fear.

Transcend the pain,
As the world beats you down.
You'll find your own direction.
Without them, without them,
You'll find a better home.
Without them, without them,
You're better off alone.
