They march in unison,
Crusade of holy purpose,
Believing only what the preacher says.
With minds too weak to see,

It's a means of control.
Obey the masters will without a question.

You blindly follow every word.
The world is crippled by its faith.

By its faith

So tell me how your god
Is helping in the world,
Or does he choose to let his people suffer?

God is dead and we have killed him.
Reject the church and use your common sense.
This is now the age of reason.
You use religion as a placebo.

They feed on your ignorance.
You are a sheep in the churches flock.

Faith is a plague that logic can cure,
Just free your mind and you'll see the truth.

If your father loves you so,
Why are his children in such pain?
If he's the omnipotent one, why won't he give the world some change?
Your faith will cease like the myth of god,
And every bible will burn.

Too long this shit
Has infected the masses.
It must purged
If we are to live on.

We will live on.

They march in unison,
Crusade of holy purpose,

Believing only what the preacher says.
