Pathetic doesn't begin to describe you
Your personality is counterfeit
Your life is a string of attempts failed miserably
To gain recognition that you don't deserve
You can't keep pushing the blame
Stop saying we've changed
We know the truth so fuck your reasons

You are the shapeshifter [x3]

I bet you'd like to know
Who will be there for you in the end
You will have nothing
You will have nothing

You need to feel safe
You built it all in vain
It will all come crashing down
All come crashing down

I will not be your excuse fo failing
This is your fault, so stop pretending
Stop pretending that you are one of us
We won't stop feeling sorry, it's your loss
Your self worth is meaningless

So take a look at yourself
So take a look at yourself
You will have nothing
You will have nothing

You need to feel safe
You built it all in vain
It will all come crashing down
Down

You ostracize yourself with
Weak attempts at fitting the mold
Weak attempts at fitting the mold

You need to feel safe
You built it all in vain
It will all come crashing down

You are nothing to me
