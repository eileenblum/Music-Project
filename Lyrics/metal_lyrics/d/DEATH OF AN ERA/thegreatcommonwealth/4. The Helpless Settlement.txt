I am filled with an insufferable rage
Like everything I ever do just ends up
Hurting me it's hurting you
Tormenting weight of frustration
I am so weak, but I still need you

All of this time
You could have left but no
You stayed and pulled me in
Look at me
You had the time, you could have walked away
Show me your worth
Tell me you'll always be

Just because they can't feel
Doesn't make it any less real
To the two of us, standing here
How could you let this happen
Go on and tell me
The truth doesn't hurt like it should
You should learn to let it go
Learn to let us go

Just cause we're young doesn't mean it's careless
You should have let this go
You walked away from me
You're only causing pain
I need your love to heal me
Let me go
Let me go

Just because they can't feel
Doesn't make it any less real
To the two of us, standing here
How could you let this happen
Go on and tell me
The truth doesn't hurt like it should
You should learn to let it go
Learn to let us go

Fuck
You
