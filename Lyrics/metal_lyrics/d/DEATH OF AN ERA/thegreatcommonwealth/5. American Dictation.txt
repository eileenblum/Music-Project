Iâm fucking torn by indecision, divided into two worlds.
everything I am is torn asunder, and taken all away.

All that I know, 
this tormented world around me.
I'm failing to show (and I can't find myself)
I'm failing to know (and I can't find myself)

Truth is, we're not so free. 
I hate that I call this my home.
This is crushing me (this is crushing me)
Born in a prison without the walls

I can't keep shut, my heart is dying to speak of what is always avoided.
Can't you see, you're slaves to ignorance (ignorance)

Cut your chain.

I'm expected to follow this command of what you are.
But tell me where have you gotten yourself when you hate yourself?
Living is not a sin, just cause I live like this.
I won't be what you want, stop.

I will not live your life. (fuck your life)
You can't force me to give up mine.

All that I know, 
this tormented world around me.
I'm failing to show (and I can't find myself)
I'm failing to know (and I can't find myself)

[Saud Ahmed of The Crimson Armada:]
There's a flame igniting 
from the stone steps of freedom's face,
destroying everything that kept us from all this hate.
There's no fucking escape.
This nation stands in its own way.

All that I know, 
this tormented world around me.
I'm failing to show (and I can't find myself)
I'm failing to know (and I can't find myself)
