Spite fills my veins at the thought of you
An unquenchable malice that cannot be tamed by any

Your demise is the only way
I will ever be at ease
I will ever be

The fact that you think that you ever meant anything
Sits in my stomach like a brick of cyanide
So run your mouth and chase your stupid fucking fame
I'll always know I'm fucking better than you

So blow your lines like the cunt you are
Face it
Your kind is poisoning the world
Fucking face it
You're just the venom in our blood
You are nothing
A drugged addicted piece of shit
You're such a piece of shit
Strung out bitch
This is pitiful
You claim it's all for fun
Truth is you have no self control

And you say this isn't always the way it's going to be
They say forgive and forget but I won't when I know what you did to me
I won't forget what you did to me

I will make you beg
I am fear itself
I am the root of your self loathing
I am hatred, I am dread
I'm fear itself
I'm fear itself

Give in to your fears, give in to me [x4]

Spite fills my veins at the thought of you
I am above you
Look up at me from your place at my feet
