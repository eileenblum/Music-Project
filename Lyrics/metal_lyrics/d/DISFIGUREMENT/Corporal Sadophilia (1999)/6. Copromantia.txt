Do you really want to know your future,
Which is lying in the Darkness?
Do you really want to hear
The prophetic voice of Doom?

Many kinds of fortune-telling
Are deceptive dotage
I possess by holy power
Of the true divination.

I can tell you the truth.
It is so easy, but hard
All your secrets inside
Deep inside intestine.
Wrinkle your ass with smile
You hope to see this stinking shit
Is leaving your flesh.
Defecate or be defecated.
Wrinkle your ass to know

I can tell you the truth.
It is so easy, but hard
All your secrets is here
You can test, you can touch

Are you ready for the copromantia?
Is your shit enough for this rite?
Don't you look to me so stupid.
Your shit is in your hands!
So put your shit on
A showel, be careful.
Tell me how it smell.
It is smell like you,
Because you are piece of shit too.
Don't you forget about this.
Grow dark inside
Your watch -- oh yes!
It is time to make it fly -- higher.
The flying shit is so beatiful.
It is shin in the moonless sky.

You must run into the place
Where your shit falls.
Gaze to a flat cake
Again and again
What do you see?
You see nothing,
But shapeless shit
Do you expect for more?

Copromantia is proved
That your body consist of shit -- don't you?
Shit is run in your veins,
Shit is hold your spine -- yes!
It is smell like you,
Because you are piece of shit too.
Don't forget!
Defecated Copromant.
Now you know your destiny.
That lake excrement in your hands.

Disfigurement are:
