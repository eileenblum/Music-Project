My dick will be your Tampax
I'm hunger for your blood
A penis veiled vampire
Will suck your menstrual mud.
My dick is not so funny
But passionate and queer
A functional vampire pump
Is good for monthly needs

Oh yes! I feel the smell
It's going out of your sexual cells
Why don't you spread your legs?
Just do it it's not a usual sex
The inner blood-thirsty sucker,
Is what I think you need
Sewerage of my blood
Vessels will make you carefree.

Take me inside of your ache
Inside of painful bleeding cunt.
Love me, cause I'm so pussy,
Your pussy sanitary pump.
Your sappy appetizing secretions
Hemorrhage cascade to your feet
Oh, sweet female damnation
Fuel for my immortality.

I'm your vaginal Dracula
Taste some pervert kind of vampirism.

Every time when you bleeding
A fascinating blood-red vine drive mad
And I drown in orgiastic
Creep from your cunt.
The critical days have coming
And blood-sucker become furious
Like insect I dig into your,
Into your blooming virgin rose.
I'm greedy, I thirsty for every drop
From your cranny. I'm thirsty,
Drop by drop I sip your honey.
To fuck? It's not a fucking.
I have a sting in place of my dick.
And what's up? What I doing?
I fuck or I sting?
I suck! And sometime I will suck out
Your life to the last drop
And your innocent your
Empty membrane will be my cruel joke.

She is dead. But I'm hungry again.
I need a fresh menstrual juice.

Soaked - cunt I bleed
Soaked - forever bleed.

Hey girl how do you like my story?
Maybe you want to be my bride?
Maybe your sweet, your innocent
Cranny will give a liquid for eternal life.
I want it. My promise to love you.
And you can live if you suck my dick.
We must be like communicated vessels.
Eternal suckers we are.

Predatory erection for you
My lovely girl
So fill my empty veins
With blood and blood with love.
