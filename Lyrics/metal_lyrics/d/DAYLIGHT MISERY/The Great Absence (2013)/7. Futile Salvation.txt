[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

I thought it would be easier, nothing can stop the pain.
My life seems so meaningless and each day remains the same.
My pride and faith are gone; the whispers are said and done.
Dark voices from inside reminds me the last goodbye.

And I'm falling again. I'm failing to the bitter end.

When a dream turns to nightmare and a nightmare turns to grief.
When regrets are haunting happiness and sobriety is unknown to me.
With this burden inside and depressive thoughts in mind
It's a game already lost and myself will pay the cost.

And I'm falling again. I'm failing till the bitter end.

Falling! Failing!
Again and again!

Broken hands are there for me
How painful this life can be?
Broken hands to lay upon
Whereâs the vision I'm looking for?

It's been more than a year I'm trying to disappear
I can't control my inner fear.
I need one more year and I will disappear
I will control my inner fear.

What the fuck is going on?
What the fuck went so wrong?

The louder the screams, the faster the dreams.
The darker the day, the louder the pain.
The darker the dreams, the louder the screams.
Futile salvation. Suffocation!

It's been more than a year I'm trying to disappear
I can't control my inner fear.
I need one more year and I will disappear
I will control my inner fear.
What the fuck is going on?
What the fuck went so wrong?
