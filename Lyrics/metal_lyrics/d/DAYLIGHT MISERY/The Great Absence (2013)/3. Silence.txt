[Music: Nicos B., Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

Like an open book of lies
Like a moment inside the light
Like a glimpse of an eye
The wind took our lives.

And I wonder if we ever meet again,
Under the stars, the scars and after death.
All I wanted was silence.

Silence - Flames and fire
Upon the stars - space and desire
Night - day - months and hours
Living a life as withering flowers.

Celebrate my grief on the wings of filth
Marching on tonight. All I wanted was to be alive!

Like a storm in paradise
Like a fog inside my mind
Like a glimpse of an eye
The wind took our lives.

And I wonder if we ever meet again,
Under the stars, the scars and after death.
All I wanted was silence.
And I'll never forget the real pain
since the day you've gone away
Wake me up from this nightmare.

Silence - Flames and fire
Upon the stars - space and desire
Night - day - months and hours
Living a life as withering flowers.

We shall meet again, this is not the end.
This is just the silence for every broken dream.
Fake belief, fragile and weak,
I keep on falling when nightfall is coming.
