[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

I could gather every love song of the world,
every single small word.
I could gather every flower to build a colorful tower.
I could gather all the tears I cry and transform them into butterflies
To send all my love to you
Oh lord, how much I miss you.

Erynnis Funeralis
Spread you wings high in the skies...

I could gather all the pain I felt in vain
All the wasted hours and days
To create a time machine and get back to where I've been.
I could gather all the tears I cry and transform them into butterflies
To send all my love to you,
Oh lord, how much I miss you.

What If I try? What if I don't?
What if everything was wrong?
I had it all and threw them away
Now I'm looking for something...something to lead me astray.

Erynnis Funeralis
Spread you wings high in the skies
Erynnis Funeralis
Find her and bring her home.

I could gather every love song of the world,
every single small word.
I could gather every flower to build a colorful tower.
I could gather all the tears I cry and transform them into butterflies
To send all my love to you
Oh lord, how much I HATE you.
