[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

There was a touch of silence in the borders of a broken mind.
There was a fearful absence for the one who is still alive.
Smell of death and decomposition lead the way to another position.
Rotten corpses all the years shall be and now, again, a desire to be free.

And I cry in vain, I died in pain for the great absence.
The world so cold, the world so plain.
And I cry in vain, I died in pain for a fake desire,
The world so cold, the world so plain.

There was a touch of nightmare in the dreams of a broken mind.
There was a fearful blindness for the one who is still in sight.
Smell of death and decomposition lead the way to another position.
Rotten corpses all the years shall be and now, again, a desire to be free.

And I cry in vain, I died in pain for the great absence.
The world so cold, the world so plain.
And I cry in vain, I died in pain for a fake desire.
The world so cold, the world so plain.

And I cry in vain, I died in pain, with no gain
And I smile one more time.
Destiny just can't be true, I can live only through you,
Just cut my veins one more time.

And I cried in vain and I died in pain, with no gain
And I smile one more time.
Destiny just can't be true, I can live only through you,
Just cut my veins one more time.
