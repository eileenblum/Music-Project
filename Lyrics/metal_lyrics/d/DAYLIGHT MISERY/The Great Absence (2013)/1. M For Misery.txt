[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

A soul made of worms and pestilence
A self destructive character in search of hope and birth.

To be unique, to be the one, to be free.
As darkness falls, to be a friend of misery.

M for Melancholy
I for Irony
S for Serenity
E for Empathy
R for Reality
And Y, Y for YOU to see!

A rotten corpse of emptiness, a dirty human being,
A self destructive character and time for all to wish.

To be unique, to be the one, to be free.
As darkness falls, to be a friend of misery.

M for Melancholy
I for Irony
S for Serenity
E for Empathy
R for Reality
And Y, Y for YOU to see!

And I pray, pray to a God that does (not) exist.
And I pray, pray to my strongest belief.

To be a friend, to be unique, to be the one, to be free
