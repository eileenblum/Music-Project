[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

What's the meaning of life after all? Is death how it seems?
And what if we can touch the sky? The grave always wins.
Have you ever imagine a life without death?
Could be there a beginning without an end?

So drop dead. Drop dead. Be a part of eternity.
Drop dead. Drop dead. Mark your name in history.

Drop dead. Accept the pain, accept the end.

What's the meaning of death after all? Is life how it seems?
And what if we can create Gods? The grave always wins.
Have you ever wondered if you enjoy the life you live?
Find a gun and pull the trigger, in the name of your entity.

So drop dead. Drop dead. Be a part of eternity.
Drop dead. Drop dead. Mark your name in history.

Drop dead. Accept the pain, accept the end.
