[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

As the filthy lies of Christ and the commandments of a fake God
Ruled the minds of human parasites, every will can't be undone.
In every country and every nation, every day and every night
A child molester rapes a life through the eyes of a useful God.

And there's no one there to speak the truth.
Nobody cares and that's the proof.
There is no justice, there is no hell or paradise,
A sharpened knife solution, within the human pollution.

And as the filthy ways of humans under the absence of a dying God,
In a society of slaves and masters, you can't be the only one.
In every country and every nation, every day and every night
A child molester rapes a life through the eyes of a useful God.

And there's no one there, to speak the truth.
Nobody cares and that's the proof.
There is no justice, there is no hell or paradise,
A sharpened knife solution, within the human pollution.

I want to see you nailed on the cross like the filthy lie called Jesus Christ.
I want to see you nailed in front of my eyes
For the misanthropic, orgasmic, ceremony of my life.

And there's no one there, to speak the truth.
Nobody cares and that's the proof.
There is no justice, there is no hell or paradise,
A sharpened knife solution, within the human pollution.
