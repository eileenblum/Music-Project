[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

Help me find something to make it last and at last stay forever.
Let me prevail the truth of the past cause I need you more than ever.

Iâm flying, but the same time Iâm dying.
Iâm falling and the world is crawling.
Iâm dying, but the same time Iâm flying.
Iâm hiding because of myself
Because this is how it ends.

Forever a slave, forever a ghost,
Forever and ever I am lost.
Despite all the pain, I play the game
But the end remains the same.

Help me find something to ease the pain. Try to forget the mistakes I made.
The truth hurts, but I cannot feel. Youâve already made me kneel.

Iâm flying, but the same time Iâm dying.
Iâm falling and the world is crawling.
Iâm dying, but the same time Iâm flying.
Iâm hiding because of myself
Because this is how it ends.

Forever a slave, forever a ghost,
Forever and ever I am lost.
Despite all the pain, I play the game
But the end remains the same.

Sorrow throughout memory and the years are passing by.
Everyone has the right to live, but everyone will also die!

So this is how it endsâ¦
