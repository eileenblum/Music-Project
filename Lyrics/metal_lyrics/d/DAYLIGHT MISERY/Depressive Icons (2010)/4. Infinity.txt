[feat. Sakis Tolis][Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

Follow me infinity
Burn my dreams, destroy me
Dragged in pain, forget me
Rip my heart out and kill me!

Take a look to the glorious past
Remember the things you did at last
You followed your heart and betrayed my soul
and that's why I end it all
Follow me through infinity deny the feeling of hypocrisy
Trust my soul, betray me once more
and let my body burn when I think of you

Follow - Follow - Follow Infinity
Burn - Burn - Burn my dreams
Drag - Drag - Drag me in pain
Rip - Rip - Rip my heart out and kill me!

Follow me infinity
Burn my dreams, destroy me
Dragged in pain, forget me
Rip my heart out and kill me!

Take a look to the glorious past
Remember the things you did at last
You followed your heart and betrayed my soul
and that's why I end it all
Follow me through infinity, deny the feeling of hypocrisy
Trust my soul, betray me once more
and let my body burn when I think of you.
