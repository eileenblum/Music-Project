[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

Under the same sky we born and we die
We learn how to love and hate and how to create
Once upon a time in our lifetime we meet someone to
love and care and maybe it's unfair

The years will pass silently full of joy and harmony
Nothing can stand in your way until the day of the
Endless fairytale

Don't judge by the smile in my face
It's fake like the promises you made
Remove the tears from your eyes,
They are part of your beautiful lies

Under the same sky we born and we die
We live in pain, sadness and grief. a requiem for our dreams
And after all the day we die. it's a day of a mournful fight
A fight with our heart, with everything that tear us apart

The years will pass silently full of joy and harmony
Nothing can stand in your way until the day of the
Endless fairytale
