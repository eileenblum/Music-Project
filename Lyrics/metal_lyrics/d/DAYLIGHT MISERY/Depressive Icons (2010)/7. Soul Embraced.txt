[Music: Q_Snc, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris/Q_Snc]

Woke up again on the bed of pain
The darkness outside is strange and I feel the same
No one can help me now. The cold chains are tight
I am trapped in this panic room and nothing seems so bright

Can't you see? Can't you see my misery?
Let the darkness fall and embrace my soul
Can't you see? The kiss that gave me life yesterday
Is now the kiss that will drown my life in pain

Endless our souls fused together
Like crystals nothing can do us harm
Endless our union lasts forever
No force sea or land will ever keep us apart

Woke up again for the very last time
The darkness outside remains, but nothing is the same
Someone can help me now. The cold chains are dying
I am trapped inside of you and you can be the light

Can't you see? Can't you see my misery?
Let the darkness fall and embrace my soul
Can't you see? The kiss that gave me life yesterday
Is now the kiss that will drown my life in pain.
