[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

There are times in life that your mind needs a helpful hand
Something more than your love,
something more than your warm touch
I am addicted to my chemicals
I am addicted to the extreme way of life

ILLUSIONS - DISILLUSIONS

Illusions - Disillusions and a mind game to guide us all
Illusions - Disillusions and a fake reality to control

My life soon will come to an end, I feel exhausted and depressed
I know I will be damaged, but I can't escape
I wonder how life will be in the other side of reality
without fake hopes and all those tear drops

ILLUSIONS - DISILLUSIONS

Illusions - Disillusions and a mind game to guide us all
Illusions - Disillusions and a fake reality to control.
