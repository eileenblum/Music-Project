[feat. Jakob Batten][Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Efthimis Karadimas]

Hold
Beware the nasty dog
That keeps the secrets of this holy place of love
Dark
Your eyes and the heart. Your vision and your blood
The world of yours without me your perfect friend in misery

Regret my life, let me stay alone, regret my life
Please I'm begging you to leave and nothing more
to think, I've nothing more to think

Small
The room can't keep it all it's going through the door
I can't stand it no more
Say
The price I have to pay to learn that mystic pray
Like slave to obey you my perfect friend in misery

Regret my life, let me stay alone, regret my life
Please I'm begging you to leave and nothing more
to think, I've nothing more to think
