[feat. Efthimis Karadimas][Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris/Efthimis Karadimas]

Sleepless nights, dreadful dreams
Panic and rage are haunting me

Touching - feeling - healing - dreaming in the
Name of all heavens
Desire is a box of thousand lies and horny black cold leather
This is a dream never to be dream by people of the sun
This shall be a word of truth that few can understand

Forgive me father for I have sinned.
Release my wrath and the hate from within
Deep in my mind lies only one thing
How can you live when your soul is not free?

Depression knocks me down, grace picks me up
Day after day, I pray and pray

Sinners - rivers - a neverending flow - a huge
Parade of thirsty dreamers
Look inside your soul and hear them. The Screamers
This is a dream never to be dream by people of the sun
This shall be a word of truth that few can understand

Forgive me father for I have sinned
Release my wrath and the hate from within
Deep in my mind lies only one thing
How can you live when your soul is not free?

Day after day after day I pray after day
After day I pray after day...
