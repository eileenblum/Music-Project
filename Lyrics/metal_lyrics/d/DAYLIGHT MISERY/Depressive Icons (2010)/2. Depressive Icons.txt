[Music: Stamos Kordas, Lyrics: Vassilis Mazaris]

LIES

And my body lies on hypocrisy
Pain and sadness beyond the madness
Beneath the grey sky try to find the light
Scream it loud and proud what goes around comes around

MEMORIES

Fulfills my mind, stabbing my heart again
And lead me to the madness of imperial darkness

Your eyes have become two depressive icons
full of broken thoughts and undone promises
My life fades away, my dreams are drowned in pain
I'm trying to control myself day after day

MEMORIES

Fulfills my mind, stabbing my heart again
And lead me to the madness of imperial darkness
