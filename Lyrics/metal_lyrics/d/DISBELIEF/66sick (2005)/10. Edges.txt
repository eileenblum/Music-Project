It's more than controlling
It's more than everything I've got
The force to finish life
Begins in heads, and ends with a knife
When it comes
Slow, deep and firmed deadly
It's more than a wish
Perhaps like prophecy
How does it start the first time?
How does it start when it comes?
The wish to kill again
Is now stronger, stronger...
First - I will try
Second - my own way to die
A third time - try to die once more
EDGES, cut, EDGES

I watch the days go by
Can't wait for the night, the night
Again my pulse grows
I'm ready to cut me off
I'm sure this will be my last try
I will kill me, myself and I
This time I'll make no faults
I will use eternal force
Is this right - is this wrong
Do that act - must be strong
Can't wait now - I waited so long
This time for sure - I'll be dead
I'm dead - I'm dead - I'm dead - I'll be dead
First - I will try
Second - my own way to die
A third time - try to die once more
EDGES, cut, EDGES

I watch the days go by
Can't wait for the night, the night
Again my pulse grows
I'm ready to cut me off
