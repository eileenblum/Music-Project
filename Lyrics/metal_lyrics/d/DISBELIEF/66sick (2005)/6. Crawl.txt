CRAWL - CRAWL
Is this the reason
Why I ask myself
I ask myself
Again and again
My own word is gone
Now what shall I do
I live the time
That will be mine
CRAWL - we'll stand and pray
CRAWL - we all pass that way

I'm the art of life
I want to scream and shout
I want to get out
I'm gonna break out
From this mad, sad place
It's been too long my staying here
I must go away
To find my way
It makes sick
It makes CRAWL
Watch me fade away
There's no chance to escape
I'll take it all away
CRAWL - we'll stand and pray
CRAWL - we all pass that way

Where will it all end?
Who decides what's going on?
I must be strong
To hold on
Which way will I try now
I'm sure despair will come
I'm on the run
New start has begun
It makes sick
It makes CRAWL
Watch me fade away
There's no chance to escape
I'll take it all away
CRAWL - we'll stand and pray
CRAWL - we all pass that way
