See how time passes bye
It runs fast 'til you die
No time for myself
Only for the thing itself
All the time - I miss to be free
Every time - I search for the key -- always lost
All the time - I can't wait so long
Every time - it's there and goes on
LOST IN TIME - LOST IN TIME

Be my time
Count every second that's for me
I count them all
From my sight
Time is a treasure of life
And I'm LOST IN TIME
LOST - LOST - LOST IN TIME

Where has my time gone?
That I used to have so long
I want to have it back
But this time I see black
All the time - I miss to be free
Every time - I search for the key -- always lost
All the time - I can't wait so long
Every time - it's there and goes on
LOST - IN TIME
LOST - LOST IN TIME

Be my time
Count every second that's for me
I count them all
From my sight
Time is a treasure of life
And I'm LOST IN TIME

Be my time
Count every second that's for me
I count them all
From my sight
Time is a treasure of life
And I'm LOST IN TIME
LOST - LOST - LOST - LOST IN TIME
