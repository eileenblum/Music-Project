Is this unreal?
What I've seen around me
Can't really stop
What starts right now
Try to be my friend!
Inject this bliss
Be a slave of the force, the force
No one decides
What's happen with me now
Be my friend - in every way
I'll never die! - I'm FLOATING ON HIGH

Two different kinds
Two open minds, one's me, one's me!
Thanks you for that gift
Than it's my destiny
Be my friend - in every way
I'll never die! - I'm FLOATING ON HIGH

Be welcomed in my own world
No rules, nothing that hurts!
I'm floating on high
A world where friends don't exist
And I am possessed by
I'm FLOATING ON HIGH
I'm FLOATING ON HIGH
FLOATING ON HIGH

Be my friend - in every way
I'll never die! - I'm FLOATING ON HIGH
Be welcomed in my own world
No trust, no tears that flow
I'm FLOATING ON HIGH
A world where black is shining
Sun is going down
I'm FLOATING ON HIGH
