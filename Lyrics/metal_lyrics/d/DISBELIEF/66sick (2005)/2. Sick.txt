DO YOU REALLY GET SICK?
SICK - SICK - DO YOU REALLY GET SICK?
SICK - SICK - DO YOU REALLY GET SICK?
SICK - SICK - SICK
SICK - SICK - SICK
Control myself, nothing else
It's always the same, and I stay here
A moment of time, that will be mine
It's SICK to stay here, I'm running free
SICK - SICK - SICK
DO YOU REALLY GET SICK?
SICK - SICK

Mistakes from my past, that I've done
Now they are back, I don't want that
I don't want that, I don't want that
I don't want that, I don't want that
SICK - SICK - SICK
DO YOU REALLY GET SICK?
SICK - SICK
DO YOU REALLY GET SICK?

I don't want that - I don't want that
I don't want that - I don't want that
To be SICK!
I don't want that - I don't want that
I don't want that - I don't want that
I don't want that - I don't want that
I don't want that - I don't want that
To be SICK!
SICK - SICK - SICK
DO YOU REALLY GET SICK?
SICK - SICK - SICK!

I don't want that - be caught alive
I don't want that - see dreams that die
I don't want that - nightmares come true
I don't want that - and I stay here!
