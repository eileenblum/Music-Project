We bring you to fall
Long enough we've called
Let our rages grow
From inside we bellow in pain
Let us strike you down
We'll let you know
Now we're waiting every single day
To watch you die, you'll die, yeah... you'll die!
You have TO ATONE FOR ALL

Can't you see our hate
For years now we're waiting
To attack our aim for sure
To march against the enemy
Let us strike you down
We'll let you know
Now we're waiting every single day
To watch you die, you'll die
You'll die
You have TO ATONE FOR ALL
You have TO ATONE FOR ALL
You have TO ATONE FOR ALL (can't you see our hate)
TO ATONE FOR ALL (can't you see our hate)
TO ATONE FOR ALL (can't you see our hate)
TO ATONE FOR ALL (can't you see our hate)
TO ATONE FOR ALL
