I take my own way
I break that all
At once
Don't want to be part of that
Don't go this way
Don't go their way
False way
War, weapons and God
The childhood's setting fall - the childhood's setting fall

Would you - do anything?
Would you - bleed for Him
Would you - do anything for your God?
FOR GOD?
Would you - do anything?
Would you - bleed for Him
Would you - do anything for your God?
FOR GOD?

I am the minority
I am the one who is right
Never I will change the scene
Around me
Why they spend all they have
Time, mind and life
All what they get from it
Is death and terror
War, weapons and God
The childhood's setting fall - the childhood's setting fall

Would you - do anything?
Would you - bleed for Him
Would you - do anything for your God?
