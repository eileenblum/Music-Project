I always TRY, TRY... trapped in this nightmare
This nightmare goes on
No hope for us all because we don't know
Rape, kill, destroy the world
A misery
I always TRY
I always TRY, TRY... I always TRY, TRY

Can't play with this madness
Because it's so real
Hate, pain, death for you is what we feel
They take our faces
And throw them in dirt
I always TRY
I always TRY, TRY... I always TRY, I always TRY, I always TRY, I always TRY
I always TRY

My mind turned away
Never have I seen so much decay
I hope to reach
I'll never fade away
Oh I - I always TRY
TRY - TRY
I always TRY - I always TRY - I always TRY - I always TRY
I always TRY

My mind turned away
Never have I seen so much decay
I hope to reach
I'll never fade away
Oh I... I hope to reach
I'll never fade away
I TRY
I hope to reach
I'll never fade away
I die!
