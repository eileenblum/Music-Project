From this day on when it starts
To disturb me
Long time I didn't realise
That I'm guilty
I think I am guilty

What the hell have I done
In different ways
No one knows of my story
No one knows anything about me

What it takes - what it makes
With all the sins I've done
How did it start? - where is the end?
CONTINUE FROM THIS POINT

I hope to find my way
A good way
Looking forward I see
A new beginning

All is new from now on
I'm feeling great - don't be afraid

What it takes - what it makes
With all the sins I've done
How did it start? - where is the end?
CONTINUE FROM THIS POINT

Days are gone bye
Days are gone bye
Days are gone bye
Days are gone bye

What it takes - what it makes
With all the sins I've done
How did it start? - where is the end?
CONTINUE FROM THIS POINT
FROM THIS POINT
THIS POINT
