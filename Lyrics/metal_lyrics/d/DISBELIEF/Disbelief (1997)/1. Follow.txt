touch this tender beautiful face
feel her warmth within - within me
what was the real reason
to say good bye and leave my life

I'll it try
to walk alone
I'll it try
and all is gone

don't follow the blind
don't follow the blind

a stranger in presence
walked blind through
this world
did not behold, what broke
to many fragments
walking all alone

I'll it try
to walk alone
I'll it try 
to stay alone

don't follow the blind
don't follow the blind
and you'll see
and you'll see . . .
