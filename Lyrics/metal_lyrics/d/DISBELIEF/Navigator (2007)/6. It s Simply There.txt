Raise my fist up high
Straight into the sky
Against it, against it!

I grew up and had a good time
Every day inspiring, find
Al day long I use to be
In my own big fantasy

Heaven turned into hell
Together with the dirt I can smell
Day by day it comes closer to me
Is there anyone to help me, help me to get free!

When comes the first step of my personal healing?

I saw my world passing bye
My way stopped for a while

It is simply there, simply there, simply there

Eternal unrest
A matter of time, Iâm totally obsessed
By the wish to escape
But nothing happens, is it too late?

When comes the first step of my personal healing

I saw my world passing bye
My way stopped for a while I was confused and I felt dead
That is the reason for an act

It is simply there, simply there, simply there
It is simply there, simply there, simply there!
