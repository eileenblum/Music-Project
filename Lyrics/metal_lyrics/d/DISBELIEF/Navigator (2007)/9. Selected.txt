You search me - behind of me
Help me - oh, my misery!

Searching son - always on the run
Canât escape - life begins to late

Selected - selected

Trace me - catch me
Kill me - oh, set me free!

Drifting son - believe and ever run
Hiding himself - in a would of emptiness

Exhaust me - love me
Hate me - for my eternity

Now Iâm gone - this battle Iâve won
No more sorrow days - cause youâve lost my way

Selected - selected

Searching son - always on the run

Canât escape - this is my fate
Selected - selected

Donât, donât, donât
Donât, donât, donât
Donât do it no more forever
Donât do it, donât do it no more forever!

Selected - selected, foreverâ¦

Searching son - always on the run
Canât escape - why have you crossed my way?

Whyâve you? Whyâve you? Whyâve you?
Why have you crossed my way?
Why have you crossed my way?

Donât, donât, donât
Donât, donât, donât
Donât, donât, donât
Donât, donât, donât

Donât do it no more forever!
