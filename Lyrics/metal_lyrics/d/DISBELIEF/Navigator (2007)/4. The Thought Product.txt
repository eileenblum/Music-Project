When it comes, when it comes,
When it comes near to me!

Now, itâs back!
I close my eyes
Weird thoughts will rise, attack!

Be a locked, cold soul, soul, soul
My thoughts under control, control, under control

Create my own, new world
That demonstrates against this force that Iâll return, will return

Thought, thought, the thought
The thought product
Thought, thought, the thought
The thought product

Break, just remember
To understand whatâs strong and where I belong

Be a wreck, sick and clear, clear, clear
In life I fight against, here, here, I fight against here!

Thought, thought, the thought
The thought product
Thought, thought, the thought
The thought product

It is strange, itâs a release
The moment when Iâm falling and I say, please!
No more thoughts, no more doubts
My shocked, empty eyes looks forward
So let me out, so let me out!

Thought, thought, the thought
The thought product
