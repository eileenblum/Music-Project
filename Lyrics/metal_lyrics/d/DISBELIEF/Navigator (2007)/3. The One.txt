Iâm the one - Iâm the one

Iâve got all my memories, Iâll never forget
I suffer in silence, step by step comesâ¦
War inside, takes this life
Throw it away, where is your next place to stay, to stay?

Can you understand me?
Why I do such things to them?
It surrounds me, Iâll fly
My will achieved for him

Freedom, mine - freedom, mine - not for me!

Iâve got all my memories
Iâll never forget
I suffer in silence, again
Again step by step comes war inside, inside!

Iâm the one
Iâm the one - Iâm the one - Iâm the one
Who prays for those whoâre gone

The dark places that Iâve seen
Never forget this horror scenes
Canât await to get back once more
To be part of the rage, against you!

Freedom, mine - freedom, mine - not for me!

Iâm the one - Iâm the one - Iâm the one
To find peace for none, for none, for none
To find peace for none!
