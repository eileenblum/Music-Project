This is a presentation
Of a normal workday of misery
The choice is not up to you
Itâs simply to leave to die

Youâre the one who decide
When it will end here

When life turns to death
Many souls will bleed, turn pale

The order is to destroy
Life in all kinds

No mercy to stay
In grief, hatred minds

Nothing - nothing
Nothing you can doâ¦
Nothing - nothing
Nothing you can do, against it!

Against it - against it

I show no compassion
I spread misery
No one will escape
And no one will be free

Life is the only reason - for my chapter
Can you imagine - what you kill and plunder
Life is to preserve - the world with passion
Not like you - with so much aggression

Nothing - nothing
Nothing you can do
Nothing - nothing
Nothing you can do, against it!

Against it - against it

Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
Nothing you can do, against it!
