Slow - Slow

It breaks my heart - when I see
Itâs all left behind - left behind of me

Slow - Slow

A gate will be opened
An new cage for me?
A restart, new life
That I can use to flee, to fleeâ¦

It breaks my heart
When I see
Something is going on
No one is waiting for me
A dream breaks up
Restarted me
From past and lie
Navigator, Navigator

From this point, Iâll help me
So I know, Iâve to flee
Iâll see more, I see changes

Feel my heart, spill my blood
Spill my blood

Slow - Slow, Slow

It breaks my heart
When I see
Something is going on
No one is waiting for me
A dream breaks up
Restarted me
From past and lie
Navigator - Navigator

A restart for me?
That I can use to flee, Navigator

From nothing to nothing
Until I pass away, away
Navigator - Navigator
