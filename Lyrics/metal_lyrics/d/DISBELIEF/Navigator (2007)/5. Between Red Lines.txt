Do you feel what I feel
I hope you feel the same
Do you see what I see
That life is turning, turning back!

Feed your life
Make it strong
I know it, life stands
Between red lines

Look what have you done
All is wasted , wasted and gone
Take the chance from me
A path will follow that youâve never seen

Feed your life
Make it strong
I know it, life stands
Between red lines

Between red lines, between red lines
Red linesâ¦, Red linesâ¦, Red linesâ¦

Will you share with me
The same air that we breathe
I know it life stands still
Still between red lines

Feed your life
Make it strong
I know it, life stands
Between red lines

Between red lines, between red lines
Red linesâ¦, Red linesâ¦, Red linesâ¦

Do you feel what I feel
Do you see what I see
Whatâve you done?
Take the chance!
Will you share with me
I know it life stands still
Between red lines, between red lines
Between red lines, between red lines
Feed your life
