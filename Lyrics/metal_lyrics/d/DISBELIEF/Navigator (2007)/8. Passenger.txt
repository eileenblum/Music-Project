So I can tell you a story ofâ¦ of my life
Of sadness and sorrow, I show you my world where I hide

How did it come that Iâm helpless, Iâm on the edge
Far away from my own life, Iâll be everywhere

Iâm the one, but Iâm not there
Iâve become a passenger, far away, lost and no one knows me
From that day on, I started to
To search for this: my attitude! Every day I like my last day

Can I be sure that Iâm right when I say, hi!
Hi, to this way that Iâm walked and passed by
Oh, every day I remember my first day on this side

Iâm the one, but Iâm not there
Iâve become a passenger, far away, lost and no one knows me
From that day on, I started to
To search for this: my attitude! Every day is like my last day

Iâm far away from my own, far away from my own
My whole life changes and starts anew
Whole life changes and starts anew, anewâ¦

Iâm the one, but Iâm not there
Iâve become a passenger, far away, lost and no one knows me
From that day on, I started to
To search for this: my attitude! Every day is like my last day

Passenger - Passenger - Passenger
Iâm far away from my own
Passenger - far away from my own
Iâm far away from my own, far away from my own
My whole life changes and starts anew
Whole life changes and starts anew, anew

Passenger
