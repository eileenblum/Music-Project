Falling down - falling down

As it starts to work in me
Many times gone bye
What Iâve seen was misery
I saw people who fly to die

Naked aggression, the will to kill
A deadly obsession, when time stands still, time stands still

Falling down
To the lost and murdered: thereâs no more evil revenge!
Falling down
It shocks, it kicks, it raped your soul away!

It shocks, it kicks, it raped your soul away, it rapes your soul
away!

Itâs war, weâre inside
A sudden attack
Ay unknown faces
We canât turn back

Falling down
To the lost and murdered: thereâs no more evil revenge!
Falling down
It shocks, it kicks, it raped your soul away!

I donât know what happens
Got this picture in me
Iâll never forget, the sight that Iâve seen
The sight that Iâve seen, the sight that Iâve seen

Forgiveness!
