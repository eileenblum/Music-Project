When silence is broken, broken!

See whatâs up!
It faces me with a mask
Iâm paralyzed
A day gets dark

When it comes
It feels so strong
I canât dwell on it
On all what surrounds, I spit!

Breakdown - resurrection

Itâs opened
A storm of no end
Isolation
A world where you have no chance!

I wake up
Itâs still and cold
The messages theyâve told
Nothing exists here in hell, forgive me!

Breakdown
When silence is broken
Resurrection
When silence isâ¦ Broken, broken
When silence is broken
When silence is broken, broken, brokenâ¦

Fears that reflect on me, like a mask
Canât describe, what Iâve seen, what Iâve seen

Breakdown
When silence is broken
Resurrection
