This hell goes on, on, on...
This hell goes on, on, on...

No one can see it, no one can sympathize
How I was deported into this hell
Was is always there, how can it be?
What was before, what have I done, I can't remember it

Hopeless, left - far away and close to me
Helpless, sad - unbending time that I'll see
Banished life - I live my life in my own dreams
This is not my world

This hell goes on, on, on...
This hell goes on, on, on...

Whispered words whirr all around
Surounded by a hypocritical sound
Turn into stone, like Jekyll &amp; Hyde
Two faces, one foolish pride!

This hell goes on, on, on...
This hell goes on, on, on...

It's just frightening, I'm just frantic
A broken life, a broken soul
So break out, just flee
Into eternity

This hell goes on, on, on...
This hell goes on, on, on...

It's just frightening, I'm just frantic
A broken life, a broken soul
So break out, just flee
Into eternity
