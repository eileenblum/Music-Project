All is left - all is left
All is left - all is left behind
All is there - all is there
Always and everywhere - always and everywhere

I've survived the hell, the monster, the jaws of life and death
Alive - alive the oppression, sin after sin my soul falls to ruin

My path ended up in total darkness

In jail for years of decay - for years in this small, dark place
My cries - my cries in the night and no one listened to them - listened to them

And no one listened to them - my cries in the night

All is left - all is left behind
All is there - all is there, always and everywhere
Always and everywhere - always and everywhere

I've searched for a place to hide - where no one can see me, touch me
All is protected - I have survived
This never ending pain - it seems to be hellish, demonic, profane
I wish it could stop for only one day, only one day, only one day, only one day!

All is left - all is left behind
All is there - all is there - always and everywhere
All is left - all is left behind
All is there - all is there - always and everywhere

I've searched for a place to hide - where no one can see me, touch me
All is protected - I have survived
This never ending pain - it seems to be hellish, demonic, profane
I wish it could stop for only one day, for only one day, only one!

I've searched for a place to hide
I've searched for a place...to hide, to hide, to hide...
