Let the fire burn - let the fire burn - a long primed return

You've got evil eyes
A black heart cold as ice
One number that will count
From ten to zero... Down!

Out of the ambush it comes
To attack the unready ones
Die for victory
Through my deadly killing spree

Still in this hideout
Where there is no doubt
To put this into real
What You've learned, so deeply!

Your first part is gone
The schedule has begun
Ready for some action
For my satisfaction

Out of the ambush it comes
To attack the unready ones
Die for victory
Through my deadly killing spree
