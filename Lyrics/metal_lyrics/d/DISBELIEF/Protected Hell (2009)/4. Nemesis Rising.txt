Join my world, enjoy it, taste it
Come inside and suffer, hell awaits you!

The dark side rises forever
It's me, I'm a part of it again
I'm your friend and the end
I'm your Nemesis - Nemesis rising
Nemesis rising - Nemesis rising - Nemesis rising

So far apart and still close to you

Day by day - over and over again, again...
Line by line - I commit myself to you - I resurrect you

Nemesis rising - Nemesis rising - Nemesis rising

Will be together as one!

Every word, all the trust, a lie, a lie...
Every single step forward is one step closer till you die

Die - your soul will be screaming
Die - and your wishes will stop from wandering

I can reach you anytime
Deadly lies passed in every line
An unseen gathering slowly becomes real
Wake up the time when I reveal

I can reach you anytime
Deadly lies passed in every line
An unseen gathering slowly becomes real
Wake up the time when I reveal myself to you, myself to you...

Now you're here, besides a monster
Caught in a trap, you're dead

I can reach you anytime
Deadly lies passed in every line
An unseen gathering slowly becomes real
Wake up the time when I reveal

I can reach you
I can reach you anytime!
I can reach you
I can reach you anytime, anytime!

Nemesis rising - Nemesis rising - Nemesis rising

Will be together as one!
