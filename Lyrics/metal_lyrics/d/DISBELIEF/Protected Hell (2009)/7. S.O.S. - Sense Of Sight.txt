I have so many things to say
I have been waiting for a better day to come!
I have the time on my side
I have the patience, it becomes friend of mine!

They insist on obedience
Manipulating, capture the weak
Total control surrounds me
A prayer for this perfect world

I have wasted so much time
I have reached the end of this life

A brainwash follows a brainwash
A tool destroys your mind
Helpless, inspired, unsuspecting
Like a person, without a sense of sight

A life full of hell
Full of obedience
Only silent screams in the night, in the night, in the night

S.O.S. Sense Of Sight S.O.S.
S.O.S. Sense Of Sight S.O.S.

I have to run away from this place
I have to win that direful race

A life full of hell
Full of obedience
Silent screams in the night

S.O.S. Sense Of Sight S.O.S.
S.O.S. Sense Of Sight S.O.S.
