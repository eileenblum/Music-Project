The sin - the sin
Here comes the sin again, again...

To do something that's hard for us
To comprehend! To comprehend!
Forgiveness for the deranged one's yet
The fallen saint! The fallen saint!

So look into the mirror
And see the scum, scum
Look under the table
The dirty way has won

Here comes the sin again, here comes the sin...

You pray for nothing if sin lives on
It's senseless! Senseless!
The raiser of shame, abuse of trust
Perish in flames, forgotten blames

So look into the mirror
And see the scum, scum
Look under the table
The dirty way has won

Here comes the sin again, here comes the sin again

Again - again - the return of sin
Again - again - the return of sin

The sin - the sin

Here comes the sin - practise what you preach
Here comes the sin - not only in church, but all around
Here comes the sin - keep it in the family, all the time
Here comes the sin - you've pledged loyality

Again - again - the return of sin
Again - again - the return of sin
