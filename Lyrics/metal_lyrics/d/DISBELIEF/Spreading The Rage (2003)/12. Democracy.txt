[Killing Joke-Cover]

You have a choice, we are your voice 
Red, blue or yellow. 
We will blow away the green 
Another five lane motorway 
(You'll never get a referendum anyway) 
Funny handshakes. insider dealing 
Et in arcadia. arcadia ego 
Backhanders and salamanders 
A powerhouse that is morally 
Mechula 
I'm sorry democracy is changing 
I'm sorry democracy is changing 
I'm not a slogan or a badge 
Or a cross in the ballot box 
Neither values or objectives 
You do not represent my deepest 
Thoughts and wishes 
Education in obsolete skills 
Stereotyping and media projection 
Industrial psychologists 
Plan a campaign that is financed by 
Big business 
You have a choice, we are your voice 
Red, blue or yellow. 
We will blow away the green 
Another five lane motorway 
(You'll never get a referendum anyway)
