Hear me...
As I mourn for the liar sky...
As I cry for my fading horizons...
See me...
As I am one with sadness...
As I walk throught your pale forest...
Hear me..
As I'm singing for my grieving soul...
As i scream your name....

Nunquam...
Nunquam...Nunquam...
I am alive but painfully soulless...

A candle...a fear...
A light...a tear...
Death embrace my eyes
and graves call me to dance...

I dive deep beneath the frozen oceans...
I find all the hideous rotten dreams...
Pain is just for a moment...
and suffering is here for an eternity...

Nunquam...Nunquam...
I am alive but painfully soulless...
I am Empty...

You believe that the sun is always shining...
and sometimes life can smile (liar)!!!
and I wonder, and I'm scared...
if this is true...if this is my way to die...(I'm dying.....)
I believe that the sun is dying..
and always sky wears black...(I'm dying...)

This sad theatre...full of laughing crowd...
Smiling, but screaming....
Cheerfull, but full of tears...

Vultures fly over my rotten body...
Sunset's suffering...
Everything here is vanished and gone...
Away...Away...Away...

Forever...forever....
