I rise from my paradox...But soon I'll be back...
I thought I could, but all my seas are petrified...

Seas of the End are repulsive...
but with a wave of your hand,
time will finish here...
stolen is my mortal sand...

Remember the tired winter, and try to feel...
I rest, i know, soon, before my raven's song
Here behind a candle, and the candle cries with me,
for you s shadows, for your moonclad eyes...

Desperation fills my eyes...
Unbearable sadness...

Tell me why you're standing there?
Silent, but smiling image...
You're nothing but a shade..
A blackclad existence...away...

You're away, and again I mourn...
Silently, slowly...
There's nothing left to say..
Scared is my dawn...

The end will pass us..
and now you're a shade
in an old forgotten canvas
with all the colours pale...
