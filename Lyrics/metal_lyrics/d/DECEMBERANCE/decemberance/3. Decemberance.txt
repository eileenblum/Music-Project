A passage unknown grows far beyond...
I follow her sounds but silence is everywhere...
In oceans, in forests and through tears I walk...
the winds, the rain whisper mourns...

In her hands I see my last day..
and when shadows descend I try to scream...
But blackness is graping my voice...
Only her image is with me...

"...and then I follow her into the Decemberance..."
