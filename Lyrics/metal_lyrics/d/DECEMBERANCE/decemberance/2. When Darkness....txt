The years are gone...
I turn my eyes to the sky...
And my sorrow's looking at my silent grief...
Searching for the light ...
Among dreams and nightmares, and it's hidden away...
Buried in my thoughts under the scales of time
But all I see is an image of my silence...
A maze of dead souls pass through my eyes
Capturing anything that declares my existence...

I don't know if I must cry...
Just because you celebrate my fears...
I don't know if I must live...
Just because I wrote my last chapter...

...and I feel the absence of the sun again...
...and I'm dreaming till the sun will touch your face...

As I sleep and see my funeral..
You will laugh at my nightmares
"Oh please, scream"
