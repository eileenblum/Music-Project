I crawl! Like the words I spoke in agony.
Finally...
In absence, the fake wall ...
fell apart from the idea of dying...
from the idea of dying in silence!
I crawl, see, I crawl!
Last drops of pride, within myself I hide
Sunrise - the last one!
Today I'll die in tears!
Forever in a web, just a bloody substitute
A puppeteer and his strings
A puppet and it's misery
Now the dice have been rolled in this game of self-hypocrisy

In a sick way of thought
Where misery of mind exists
I sing a woe for the one I once was
in the winter of souls
Reality is something I ignore...
And so my Truth remains inside
a thrown mask in the corner...
