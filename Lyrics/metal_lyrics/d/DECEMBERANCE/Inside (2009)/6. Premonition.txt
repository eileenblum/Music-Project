End of day, so tired...
I think I can breath no more
The rain ceased, see...
Everything should be clear by now
Voices and guilts so loud in silence
A candle in the mirror
Enlights an aged naeve's portrait
In a grey, solid, but so vague sea of irony...
In a way, I understand
and through my open pores I realise
that sleep looks at death
through this mirror
I'm so afraid to sleep...
I'm so afraid to sleep...
I'm so afraid to sleep...
I'm so afraid to sleep...
Colors and sounds attack me
slowly they wrap around me
I can't move in this revolving room
Everybody has to be afraid of something
Like a vital lie keeps me awake...
My own one
My eyes are heavy like the guilts I have
Nothing has changed, not even the words
Nothing has changed, not even the thoughts
Nothing has changed, not even the silence
Nothing has changed, not even the End...
