The rain stops...
But my heart still misses the sun that shined somewhere else
Maybe the sun never shined after all
Maybe I kept it out of my world
Because it wasn't what I expected
Or just the light cleared up the pictures of the past...
Pictures of old fears and sadness
that created a world of bitterness inside the mind
of an unprotected child
That kept him out of his friends and family
with only emotion the anxiety of what is to become tomorrow
