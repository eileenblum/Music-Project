Oh Lord!
How cold, I stand...
How scared!
On my strange throne
A gift... So be it...
Dreaming images of wasted feelings
Like flowing rivers in my poisoned mind
Have you ever tried to hold a sun?
Inner scars...
A war inside my mind!
Mirrors and masks attack me...
Slowly they wrap around me...
Sleep is a fucking death rehearsal...
Moving mirrors among the imaginary trees
Reveal hidden scars
Maybe my mask is thrown away
Scattered in a thousand pieces in the corner
...and the wind carried me away
To the birth of time
Where insanity and grief
Are growing in the same womb
I cried...
"So lost in my memories
Forgiveness... Insanity... Demons"
I wonder if the hands of time are stuck...
Or just Time has committed suicide!
