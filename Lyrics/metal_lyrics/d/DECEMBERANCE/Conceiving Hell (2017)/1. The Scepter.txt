A king will rise inside, in mind away from light 
Mighty without a might...
A prison made by me, my wisdom and my pride
Concrete walls of air...

Liar, liar, liar, liar

Holding my dreadful scepter, ruling the world in shade
Spoiled like a king is, a clown
Servants made of clay, kneeling before my will
Laughing and laughing aloud, the king

This anger consumes my mind
I have forgotten the human form
I cover the shame with disgust
Servants made of clay, kneeling before my will
Laughing and laughing aloud...

Shapeless, silent, perfect...
Countless, talking hell...
Roaring, starving, mocking...
Shapeless, silent, perfect hell

Trying to trick my mind, tearing my sick throat apart...
Freedom lies no more, and sanity is gone away.

I can't erase my nightmares, I am what I remained to believe in
Every moment is getting less, every moment is getting worse
Trying to trick my mind, tearing my sick throat apart to speak...

An endless spin is reality, the one I was always plead for
Utopia, a bliss..
An imitation of life, an excellent sharp room
A cage, a crown...

This scepter points the sea...
This scepter repeals...
This scepter moves the waters...
This scepter condemns...
This scepter abolish...
This scepter gives forms.
