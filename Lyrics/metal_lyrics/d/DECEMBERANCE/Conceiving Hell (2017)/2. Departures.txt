Today, I stepped on my soul.
I fed it with sulfur and soil.
The wise one foretold correctly.
Things took their place as they ought to.
A red rooster brought some laughter
A silly mistake is over... Thank God...

Growing hate within, 
An offer of the pure. 
Shameless are my words.
A tombstone on my throat.
Spoken truths silent
Cover the worst of lies.
Growing hate within, 
An offer of the pure.

Windmills you fool, no giants at all
They are all dead now, so long deceased
The great escape, went away...

Growing cage within,
An offer of the pure
Growing rage within,
An offer of the pure
...and the wind begins to fall apart
Like the statues of my pride.
Departures of all.
Forgiveness of nothing
Departures of all.

...and the empty scaffold of mine  
Living a wasted life
...and the prisons of a poisoned mind
Leaving a wasted life.
Departures of all.
Forgiveness of nothing
Departures of all.

...and the wind begins to recall
Every single hour.
Departures of all.
Forgiveness of nothing.
Departures of all.
