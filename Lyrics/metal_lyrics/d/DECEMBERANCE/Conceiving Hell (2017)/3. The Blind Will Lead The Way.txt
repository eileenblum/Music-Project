[Music: Y. Filippaios / M. Kousourlis/ A. Karayiannis, lyrics: Y. Filippaios]

The pressure of silence
The air is ending, like the sand
Pointless expression of life
It grows inside and yes, inside is the place.
I cannot erase my nightmares
It's a simple joyous carnival of nothing

Empty eyes
Surround a thousand deaths
They belong to me, they are all mine
I own their septic scent
Encircling countless sorrows
Written in a paper made of ash and water.
The eerie calmness of the defeat
No use for fighting no more
A battlefield... a life!

Digging graves in mind
Soil above my head
Coffins of the silent ones
Whispering curses 

The only way out of misery
Is to embrace the perfect despair.
