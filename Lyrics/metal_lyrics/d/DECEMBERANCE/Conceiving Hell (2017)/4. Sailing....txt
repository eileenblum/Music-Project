[The narration is part of the suicidal note of the Greek poet Kostas Karyotakis - 1928]

Corrosion of a normal mind, yelling from its normal grave...
Religion of hate, and it is so glorified...
Gray as an actor can be, laughing for this horrid joke.
Religion of hate, and it is so glorified...

Dead for a thousand years, 
Speaking through an empty mirror
Walls can not hold the rage
Of someone who lives no more
Of someone who cares no more
Oblivion, rage, shame, dark, mad, inhumane.

Buried thoughts in the smallest box, no reason of light, no point for air,
Dead for a thousand years...

Marching among this wasteland...
Hearing every single hour 
Of this pointless life I lived in shame
Counting waves at a shore.

Sea of vastness, holds my dirty hands
Pulling under my voice
Storm surrounds me, no point for fighting, maybe I'll win...
Sea's my only home, I have to return, I am so welcomed...
Thick as a molten land
Polluting the aspects of life
Gasping for air...

Crawling, sinking again
Breathing, covered by dust
Words have lost their meaning...

It's time to reveal my tragedy, my rampant sickness inside
I tried to learn for life without being able to conceive it.

I hate this act, I 've been assigned of
I plead for the one, the one bitter end...
I pay for all who see no way in life

Crawling, sinking again
Breathing, covered by dust
Words have lost their meaning...

For all who are slaves of their collapse.
I taste all of the joys after all.
And I'm willing for a disgraceful death.
