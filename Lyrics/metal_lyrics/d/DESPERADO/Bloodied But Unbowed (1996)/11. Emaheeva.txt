Never thought much about right or wrong
Never thought much about what I've done
Never think much about what I'll do
Don't give a damn 'bout when I'm through

Am I evil, girl, I don't know
Am I evil, sent from below
Am I evil, born to be damned
Am I bad, power mad
Cursed where I stand?

[Chorus:]
Am I evil, am I evil
Am I, I, I, I evil
Am I evil, am I evil
Am I, I, I, I evil

Ask me why and I won't know
Ask me how and I won't show
Ask me where and I will lie
Ask me who, spit in your eye

Am I evil, girl, I don't know
Am I evil, sent from below
Am I evil, born to be damned
Can I change, turn the page
Be a new man?

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Cross me once, I'll laugh at you
Cross me twice, break you in two
Make me mad and I will turn
Bust my balls, I'll watch you burn

Am I evil, girl, I don't know
Am I evil, sent from below
Am I evil, born to be damned
Am I crazed, hell's filet
Lucifer's brand?

[Chorus (x2)]

Oh, oh
Am I evil?
Ow, am I evil?
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah, baby
