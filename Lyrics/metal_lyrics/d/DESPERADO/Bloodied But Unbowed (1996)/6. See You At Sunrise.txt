Look at how you've come to this
You gave it all for a stolen kiss
Now look at yourself, look at yourself, you're nowhere
All night long you'll lay and think of me
You were so sure that I wouldn't see
Go take a good look, take a good look, you're nowhere

See you at sunrise
See you in the morning's light
There won't be any compromise when I'm blowin' you away

[Chorus:]
See you at sunrise
See you at sunrise, my friend
See you at sunrise
See you at sunrise, my friend

Are you blind or didn't you see
You crossed the line and you came to me
How could you not know, how could you not know you were over
A lesson taught, my spilled well
What kickin' you box and you went hell
You let it all go, you let it all go, you're over, ah

See you at sunrise
See you in the cold daylight
There won't be any alibis when they're takin' you away

[Chorus]

See you at sunrise
See you at sunrise, my friend, ooh

[Solo]
