Yeah, alright, ha ha ha

Born a rambler, roamin' from town to town
Chase the dollar, huntin' that bounty down
Gonna hunt 'em down
Ever make 'em dance where their feet never touch the ground

[Chorus:]
Hang 'em high
Come on boys, we're gonna hang 'em high
Hang 'em high
Round 'em up, we're gonna hang 'em high

Gonna hang 'em high, oh, oh yeah

Heading up, we're goin' where the chase don't end
Every towns gun got a price on his head
They're as good as dead
Gonna watch 'em swing at the end of a gallows thread

[Chorus]

Then we'll watch 'em dance where their feet don't touch the ground
So string 'em up and lay that money down and hang 'em high
Hang 'em high
String 'em up, boys

[Solo]

Ooh, ow, yeah
Well oh, then we'll watch 'em dance where their feet don't touch the ground
So string 'em up and lay that money down and hang 'em high, ooh
Hang 'em high

Hang 'em high
Come on boys, gonna hang 'em high
Hang 'em high
Round 'em up, we're gonna hang 'em high

Hang 'em high
Stringin' 'em up from town to town then they lay that money down
Hang 'em high
Come on, hang 'em, hang 'em high, come on, hang 'em, hang 'em high, yeah

Hang 'em high
Every gun as good as dead, every price got on his head
Hang 'em high
Watch 'em dance, watch 'em die, take a chance, just hang 'em high

Hang 'em high
Come on boys, hang 'em high
Hang 'em high
Round 'em up, we're gonna hang 'em high
