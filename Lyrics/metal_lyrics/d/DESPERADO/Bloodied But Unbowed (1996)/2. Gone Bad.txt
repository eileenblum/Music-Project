Yeah, huh huh huh

Say you thought I was gonna be
Someone more like you, someone less like me
So you fight every step I'd take
Try to second guess every move I make
Tell me what did I say
Won't you tell me what did I do
That makes you hate me like you do

You gone bad, the preacher told me
You gone bad, I heard him say
Well, how would he know anyway, yeah, yeah
You gone bad

So I'm bad, cut off from the rest
So I walk alone, everything you detest
Why should I play the games you play
Should I worry 'bout all the things people say
Tell me why should I care
Won't you tell me what should I prove
That I'm just as feeble and lost as you?

You gone bad, the teacher told me
You gone bad, I heard her say
How would she know anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gone bad, bad, bad, bad, ow

[Solo]

Ow, ow, oh, oh, oh, ooh, yeah
So tell me what did I say
Won't you tell me what did I do
To get you to hate me like you do

You gone bad, the sheriff told me
You gone bad, I heard him say
Well, how would he know anyway, yeah, yeah
You gone bad, the people told me
You gone bad, I heard 'em say
Well, how would they know anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gone bad, bad, bad, bad, oh, oh, oh
You gone bad
