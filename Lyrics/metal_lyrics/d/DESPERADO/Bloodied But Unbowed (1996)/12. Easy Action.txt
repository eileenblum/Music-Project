Tapped out, gotta get some action
Case cash brings satisfaction
I'm hot and ready to roll
Crap out and I'm in a hole
All I want is, all I need is

Sittin' on a hard sixteen
I'm down, you know what I mean
Stone cold starin' at a truck
That bullet means I'm outta luck
All I want is, all I need is

Easy, easy action
Easy, easy action

Hands stiff, nothin' in the hole
For a pair I'd bet my soul
Decks heatin' but I'm too late
Drawin' four to an outside straight
All I want is, all I need is

Easy, easy action
Easy, easy action
Easy, easy
Easy, easy action

Oh, oh, oh

[Solo]

So roll the dice, let them bones a roll
Deal the cards, I'm too deep in the hole
Let it ride, I haven't lost my soul
Roll the dice, deal the cards
Let it ride, I'm a gamblin' suicide

Racks cold, shows nothin' but green
House stooge is pickin' me clean
Chips fall to the toss of the till
Whole numbers fall off of the wheel
All I want is, all I need is

Easy, easy action
Easy, easy action
Easy, gimme easy
Easy, easy action

Easy action, baby
I want it easy, gimme easy action, alright

I want it easy all night long, yeah
