She got a look you want to know better
But beware, you better forget her
She got style and a casual grace
But her smile's been all over the place

If you try to get her to stay
You'll wake up all alone the very next day

Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy you she'll go down
Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy her you'll go down
Down on your knees

Tell the boy that the lady's a tiger
Full of noise, easy laughs and a liar
Suck you in, man, the girl's a seducer
Once you're got, well, she'll just turn you loose

If you try to push her away
She's back twice as hard the very next day

Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy you she'll go down
Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy you she'll go down, down, down
Down on your knees

[Solo]

Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy you she'll go down
Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy her you'll go down, down, down

Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy her you'll go down, down, down, down
Made for trouble, made to please
To satisfy her you'll go down
Down on your knees, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
