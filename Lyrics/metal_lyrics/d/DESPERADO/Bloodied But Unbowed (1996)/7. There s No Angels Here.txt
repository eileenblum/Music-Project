Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't need no one, don't want nothin'
Had it but it got away
Heard the stories, wrote some pages
There nothin' more to say
There's no pleasure, there's no passion
There's no nothin' but nothin' will do
Tired of livin', not ready for dyin'
Least not 'til I'm through

Sayin', lord, I need someone
Someone to answer when I pray
Sayin', lord, I need some love
Somethin' to make me wanna stay

[Chorus:]
There's no angels here, there's no angels anymore
Headed for the coast, ain't comin' back for sure
There's no angels here, there's no angels anymore
No one worth forgivin' and there ain't no law

Winds are blowin', winds of changes
Hard to hang on to a prayer
Time's a healer, time's a killer
Time takes everything that's there
I'm the reason, I'm the rhymer
I'm the one they all been lookin' for
Here to lead the unforgiven
Here to stay this time for sure

[Bridge:]
Lord, I need someone
Someone to answer when I pray
Sayin', lord, I need some love
Somethin' to make me wanna stay

[Chorus]

No one worth forgivin' and there ain't no law, yeah

[Solo]

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's no angels here, no law
There's no angels here no more

Don't need no one, don't want nothin'
Had it but it got away
Heard the stories, wrote some pages
There nothin' more to say, yeah

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

No angels here, no angels anymore
Headed for the coast, he ain't comin' back
There's no angels here, there's no angels anymore
No one worth forgivin' and there ain't no law
No one worth forgivin' and there ain't no law
No one worth forgivin' and there ain't no law

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
