Ooh, ooh, oh oh

Ooh, when you walked away, I saw the curtain start to fall
And as my blue sky turned to grey, I knew I'd lost it all
And as your smile began to fade, ten thousand pictures fill my head
Of all the good and happy times we had and feelings left unsaid
Too much was left unsaid

Girl, I want you to stay, I beg you, I pray
Don't leave me this way
I've so much to say, oh, don't walk away
How long must I pay

[Chorus:]
Calling for you, calling for you
Lost without you, nothing else matters
Can you see through, all that I do
I'm calling for you now and forevermore

And if I told you how I feel, girl, would it change a single thing
Or were the times we had unreal but not the tears they bring
The memories they sting

Girl, I want you to see I need you with me
Oh, please let us be
I've so much to give, please let our love live
Oh, can't you forgive

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Girl, I'm tired and alone, my heart has no home
My tears they fall like stone
And now I'm afraid your feelings did fade
Can our love be saved

Calling for you, calling for you
Lost without you, nothing else matters
Can you see through, all that I do
I'm calling for you now and forever

Calling for you, calling for you
Calling for you now and forever
Calling for you, calling for you
I'm calling for you now and forevermore

Oh, now and forevermore
Ooh, oh yeah, yeah, ah
