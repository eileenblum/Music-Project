I'm gonna find it, there's nothing more to say
But only a child believes in miracles
Last spotted nowhere and nowhere's far away
But I can't let it go, why I don't know
Ain't the only one who ever tried
Ain't the only man who lived a lie
I'm no better than the ones who died
But a man ain't a man if he don't take a stand
And he won't put it all on the line

Well, the heart is a lonely hunter
And the pain inside's gonna tear you apart
Well, the heart is a lonely hunter
And like a shot from a gun or knife's goin' straight to your heart

Try to remember the time it got away
Can't hold a memory even if you try
Slipped through my fingers like a night slips into day
And I tried to hold on, I tried and it's gone
Ain't the only one to ever lose
Ain't the only man who had to choose
I'm no stranger to that kind of news
But a man ain't a man if he don't make a stand
And he won't put his heart on the line

Well, the heart is a lonely hunter
And the pain inside gonna tear you apart
Well, the heart is a lonely hunter
And like a shot from a gun or knife's goin' straight to your heart
Goin' straight to you heart, ooh

[Solo]

Ain't the only one to walk the line
Ain't the only man who's come to find
That I'm no different, I know love is blind
But a man ain't a man if he won't take a stand
And he won't put his soul on the line

Well, the heart is a lonely hunter
And the pain inside's gonna tear you apart
Well, the heart is a lonely hunter
And like a shot from a gun or knife goin' straight to your

It's a lonely, it's a lonely hunter
And the pain inside gonna tear, gonna tear you apart
Well, the heart is a lonely, it's a lonely hunter
And like a shot from a gun or knife goin' straight to you heart

Goin' straight to you, goin' straight to your
Goin' straight to your heart, yeah
It's a lonely, it's a lonely
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely hunter, yeah
