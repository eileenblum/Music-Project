It stood in the meadow, wind blowin' through its mane
Cryin' go, go, go, go and do it
He stares out the window, anger feeds his flame
Cries oh, oh, oh I can't lose it
And he asks no questions why 'cause he knows it's do or die
He got colder and tough, now he's hard to the stuff
He's got to go and try

[Chorus:]
Run wild, run free on the road to nowhere
Run wild, run free from the pain and misery
Run wild, run free on the road to nowhere
No one's gonna change your life

She stood in the doorway tryin' to change his mind
Sayin', "no, no, no don't you do it"
He walked through the doorway, she started to cry
He said, "oh, oh, oh don't you lose it"
But she asks no questions why 'cause she knows it's do or die
She just smiles and hangs tough 'cause she's hard to the stuff
She knows he's got to try

[Chorus]

No one's gonna change your life, oh yeah, ooh

[Solo]

They ask no questions why 'cause they know it's do or die
They got colder and tough, now they're hard to the stuff
They know they got to try

[Chorus]

No one's gonna change your life, oh yeah, ooh
