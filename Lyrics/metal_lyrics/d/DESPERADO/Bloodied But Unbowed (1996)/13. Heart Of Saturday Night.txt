Ooh, yeah, alright
Well, you gassed her up, you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet thing in your Ford mobile
Barrelling down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

You got paid on Friday, your pockets are jangling
Then you see the lights, lord, how you get all tingling
Cruisin' with a six, yeah
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair, shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out every trace of all the other days in the week
You know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reaching your peak

Stoppin' on the red, goin' on the green
'Cause the night'll be like nothing, boy, that you have ever seen, yeah
Barrelling down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
Yeah, you're cruisin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night, ooh

[Solo]

Is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'
The telephone's ringin', it's a second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye
The magic or the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of quiver down in the cold
'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
Now you're stumblin'
Stumblin' on the heart of Saturday night
Now you're stumblin' down
Stumblin' on the heart of Saturday night
Yeah, you're stumblin'
Stumblin' on the heart of Saturday night, yeah, oh yeah

[Solo]
