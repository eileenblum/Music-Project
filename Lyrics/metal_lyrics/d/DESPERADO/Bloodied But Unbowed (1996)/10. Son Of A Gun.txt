Born to face the dark alone
By his father's guns he'll right the wrong
Following the man in black
Through the desert, to the tower and back, yeah

Nobody can stop a gun
Words or looks never killed someone
Nobody can stop a gun
It's death, the final weapon

He's the son of the gun
He's the son of the gun

Cold as steel and twice as hard
Measuring his manhood by the yard, yeah
Love and dying are his life
Wears his father's iron by his side, he's in love, oh yeah

Nobody ever stopped the gun
Some tried, now their days are done
Nobody ever stopped the gun
It's said, like father, just like son

He's the son of the gun
He's the son of the gun
Just the son of the gun
He's the son, son, son of the gun

[Solo]

He's the last of time before
Winning every fight, they lost the war, ha ha
Three remain from world of old
As he walks the prophecy unfolds, he's in guns, he's in gun

Nobody can stop his guns
Do their work and the bodies thump
Nobody can stop his guns
They spill some blood and the world moved on

He's the son of the gun
He's the son of the gun
Just the son of the gun
Just the son, son, son, son, son of the gun
