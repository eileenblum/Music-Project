Broken man in a trance falling sick once again
Warning signs to the mind comas not far behind
Sleep the eternal sleep
Never to awake never to live
All the shock, tension, fear
Sickness, death, always near
Into trance once again
Just one more dying man
Sleeps the eternal sleep
Never to awake never to live
Man on machine, living only death
Man on machine, never to awake again
Never to awake again
Eternal sleep, eternal sleep
Eternal sleep, eternal sleep
