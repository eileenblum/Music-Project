Mammoth to man morbid to god it's coming to take them away
Coming in sight viewing in fright say goodbye to today
Collecting the living collecting the dead
It matters not what you are
The hearse has arraived so step up inside
And into a world so bizarre
Everyone rides no one denied the hearse has no mercy for you
No one can plead no one can beg nothing is all that you can do
Created by god to take them from earth
And to a place their home built from dirt
Shrieks from the hearse!! Shrieks from the hearse!!
Leaving them waiting for their demise they stand all alone
And look the skies, to the skies!!
Brought unto us, god's own dark curse,
Why must the die? Shrieks from the hearse.....
