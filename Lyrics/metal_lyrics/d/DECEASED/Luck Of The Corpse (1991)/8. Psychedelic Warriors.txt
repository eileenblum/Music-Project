Dissected systems rearranged it reflects and brings death
Your changing the time has come to go insane
Your brains are twisted and deranged the blood clots
The bad thoughts dead nerves die and hatred oozes from it's nest
Into a state of genocide, into a state of mental genocide
A mental illness are you insane? Your soul's lost it's distraught
The world bends, twisting, taking all away
Your every thought isn't your own, have you lost your mind?
Into a state of mental genocide, into a state of mental genocide
In your brain you're insane, In your brain going insane
In your brain you're insane, In your brain going insane
The morbid fiends unveil dark scenes showing true reality
Mental illness it's your time in your heart &amp; in your mind
Mind!!
Crazed the whole world's crazed, sane but what is sane?
What is it you hear? Those voices talking to your mind!!
In every living brain is darkened and illness
