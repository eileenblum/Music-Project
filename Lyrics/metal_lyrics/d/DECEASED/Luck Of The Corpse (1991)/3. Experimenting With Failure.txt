Dying faulting falling world
Down with future dark turmoil
Non existing chance to live
Unite with darkness and forgive
Man who wants to live again
The earth is dead, now let it rot away
Death finding strength in death
Close your eyes and slowly drift away
Death is ours instead away to doom we're led
And all must know the world is dead
Into a place for all who care
To a world without repair
No gloomy minds, no dark abyss
Leaders, Gods, just don't exist
Mother Nature's burning sun
Healthy people live as one
Slow to live, quick to die
Death is just the tears we cry
Dream, you can dream, but you shall see
Doom for you and doom for me
Reality awakes us and quickly we know
Dreaming won't help us for nothing will.....
