The twisted flesh, alive or dead
Their veins are flowing with the blood of death
The final act, the last taboo
Yes! It's truth the dead will feast on you
These savage ghouls of obscene gore
Like insane rats they're still craving more
No survival, no escape it's just a world of.....
Graphic repulsion!
Dead cannibals of modern age
Have come from death in fits of all out rage
Without a pulse on man they feast
A scene of bloodshed has now been unleashed
A scary scene that stains my mind
Is knowing fact I too will die
No survival, no escape it's just a world of.....
Graphic repulsion!
They tear the brains apart, and swarm upon the heart,
It's never ending gore with life and death at war
Orgies of disease leaving the world in disbelief
The streets are colored red with blood from shattered veins
As we fall their legion grows as every grave is bare
Yes! Every grave is bare, the war of hell unleashed
Into battle!
Starving ghouls intensify the mania
The stench of death dances through the rotten air
There's millions slain as casualties keep coming strong
As certain doom awaits us all some place sometime
Gore pouring from the wounds of the awful dead
The naked eye the witness to it all
Our end is quickly coming fast this twisted deadly plague
Is sweeping up the earth, outbreak!
Yes I know where damned to hell!
Their screams cover up the night
Haunting all the world the cries of war
And though a few of them will fall they're waiting in the dark
Distorted birth is quick to come again
This has to be an awful nightmare!!!
No place on earth the world's a tomb
No place to run amongst these ghouls of doom
The world's a tomb, the world's a tomb
No place to run because.....
The dead are among us!!!
