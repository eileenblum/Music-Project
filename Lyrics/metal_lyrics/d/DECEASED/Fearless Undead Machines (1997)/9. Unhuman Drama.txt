I wish my mind would just slow down to a slightly moving crawl
I've seen the terror and watched the dead molest my loved ones gone
With death so pale these ruling monsters will leave their mark on me
As I lose my edge I realize something's got to give
For a man that fears both life and death what is to be done?
Insane from knowing what awaits an outcome negative
A skeleton that's incomplete a human shape of fear
Thrown to the powers of death unknown unfolding before my eyes
And with my prayers unanswered they'll leave me for their kind
And now I know without a doubt that "god" is just a word
A grotesque creed has defiled the land mindless yet in total control
In all my years I'd never dream that earth would come to this
Man no longer "power creature" living beneath the sun
And so my search for heaven shows me that it's not there
No faith I learn that religion never was waiting for me
Now I've no emotion no feeling no cares at all
I'm drained of my only pure life as sorrow claims a soul
There's little hope and endless pain leaving me broken and weak
Deathlike in trance I'm quickly fading oh God you've forsaken me
These are tears of a beaten man that slowly wear my face
The scenes of doom may slightly alter the outcome's the same
This lonely tale just keeps repeating in circles without an end
A rotting world filled with creatures from hell existing humans damned.....
It's truly over!
I feel all alone in my plead to die and never return again
The need for flesh and malevolence is something I fear to come
And then someone or something grabs me and pulls me from this fright
I suddenly feel unafraid, safe and so alive.....
I'm so alive
Is it over? Did the torture end?
What's happening? Please tell me!
