More than once we've closed our eyes to science and its flaws
Ghastly research carries on locked behind a door
While cancer cells still breed like roaches killing off the land
They disturb peace and destroy life, for this we all shall die?
The silent creature, the walking dead
The deadly dose of chemicals have changed the course of man
As reborn corpses activate on impulse from beyond
And there's no time and there's no end for finally it is done
So face the truth and live in fear of what has come at last
The silent creature, the walking dead
And every human placed on earth will bring their scent to them
As horror will now become the world
Like rabid dogs they smell the life that's flowing in our veins
A world of ghouls will storm mankind new life their destiny
As moaning corpses leave the ground and walk again on earth
Shattered coffins thrown aside for death's finally left it's womb
The panic it starts as reason has stopped,
The human mind must now adjust
Adjust to the buried walking the earth rabid to devour us all
A constant reminder is the stench of death
of all the world's become
Quickly we learn they feed on the flesh as the hollow victims they grow and
grow
The dreaded dark no place to hide from their reaching hands
The monsters slow yet menacing seeking out a soul
You close your eyes yet still you see the creeping reality
You tell yourself this isn't so but yet it's real, it's true
Run we must run, try to get away
Shelter somewhere, anywhere, from corpses that await
We're living in fear, but still we must go on
The shock must not stop us, our minds must stay calm
The silent creature, the walking dead
