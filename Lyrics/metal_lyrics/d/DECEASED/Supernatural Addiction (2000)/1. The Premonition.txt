Broken down a nervous wreck yet there are no regrets,
All the prestige drains my soul as illness takes to bed,
It's time I need to ease my mind and become new again,
So rest my child and be cleansed for breakdown's not the end,

But what is this? What leads me from my room?
An apparition? It beckons me!

In this place here I rest while doctors roam the halls,
Yet I'm alone inside myself to struggle with my fears,
And there it is I can see a shadow on the wall,
Calling me towards the end and onwards to the morgue,

But the fear it takes my breath away,
So near is the lonely world of death,

I try to think of other things yet it is always near,
I just can't help but walk its path and end up at the morgue,
No, not the morgue! Not that dreaded place!

The morgue is cold and stinks of death the bodies freezing cold,
I feel the grasp of something strange pulling at my soul,
The dead just laying on their slabs sends chills right down my spine,
And there's that shadow on the wall its image stains my mind,

That shadow, that shadow on the wall,
That shadow, that creeping down the wall,

What does this tell me of my mind this crazy lunacy,
I fear that this is a sign that death is wanting me,

That shadow, that shadow on the wall,
That shadow, creeping down the wall,
That shadow, that shadow on the wall,
That shadow, creeping down the wall,

Down the wall!

My release from this place should take this all away,
My mind has healed up long enough for life it now awaits,
So off I'll go into the sky and ride the flying plane,
Back to a place where I belong the soothing hand of fame,

But wait it's that shadow once again my fate is in my own hands,

I run away from the boarding plane that takes off in the night,
As up in flames death does claim everyone but I,

That shadow, that shadow warned me of the end,
That shadow, that shadow let me live again,
That shadow, that shadow pulled me from the flames,
That shadow, a premonition!
