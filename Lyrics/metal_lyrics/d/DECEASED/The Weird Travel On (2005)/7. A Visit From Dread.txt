Unselfish the death is passed to someone new
Dreadful dreary night will set the tone

Night, this evil night, for on this night
It knows who'll be the one to die
Night, this evil night, for on this night
The grip of death's closer
Night, this evil night, for on this night
The waiting line to suffer
Night, this evil night, for on this night
It was always you who'd be the one to die!

Say your prayers and lock your doors from a visit from dread
The only chance you had is gone the visitor's here
Beware the errors in your life a visit from dread
Say your prayers and lock your doors the visitor's here
Say your prayers and lock your doors from a visit from dread
The only chance you had is gone the visitor's here
Beware the errors in your life a visit from dread
There are no prayers no doors to lock the victim is YOU!!!
