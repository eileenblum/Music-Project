Open wounds the open gash let it all begin
Disease it dances on the grave and celebrates the end, the end!

Away with smiles away with life destroying all in time
Craving illness carries on marching down the line

Gnawing at the guts of man a vicious, craving illness
Trauma lives inside us all it's turned a healthy world

Gnawing at the guts of man a vicious, craving illness

On it goes it never rests start the morbid heave
Bringing on the living ghost a whiter shade of pale, so pale!

So fast it takes them from the joy ugliness alive
That person slumped in that chair looks nothing like mankind

Gnawing at the guts of man a vicious, craving illness
Trauma lives inside us all it's turned a healthy world

Gnawing at the guts of man a vicious, craving illness

It turns and it feeds
Attacking the world
DISEASE, DISEASE

It's craving forever
And it's never fulfilled
Gnawing at the guts of man a vicious, craving illness

Reduced to nothing taken down failing hand now falls
A skeleton of broken mass the wicked's taken hold, stronghold

The living left to grief and mourn unveil the black of death
Watch the pupils fade away and stop the view of life

Gnawing at the guts of man a vicious, craving illness
Trauma lives inside us all it's turned a healthy world

Gnawing at the guts of man a vicious, craving illness

The living left to grief and mourn unveil the black of death
Watch the pupils fade away stop the view of life

Turned body of the healthy human life
Illness takes our mind
Attacking 'til we die
Destroys the one you love
