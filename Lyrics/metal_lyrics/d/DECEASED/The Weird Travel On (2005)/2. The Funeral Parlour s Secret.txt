They haul the dead from corpse to burial so the soul can mend
They show you care in this saddening time with a heartfelt good intent
Cadavered loved ones safe and blessed until the funeral
Unaware of the haunts and scares inside you soon to spoil

Respected wishes now intact you want only to unwind
The caring hand of the funeral parlor helps to ease your mind
But death isn't easy on the heart of the always mourning soul
Eating at you like a starving fiend, can you keep control?

The door is open for escape
And can be locked once you're outside
Morbid feelings grow to damage
Thoughts you can't deny

All our lives we thrive to live
There's always obstacles
Challenge is stay afloat
And find closure to it all

The tear is sharp and gnaws at you
Digging in your mind
Death has screamed down in your ears
And it's growing only louder

All our lives we thrive to live
There's always obstacles
Challenge is stay afloat
And find closure to it all

Death has set it free!!!

Escape, resist, choices
Calling

Decide, outcome, it's time
Waiting

Escape, resist, choices
Calling

Decide, outcome, it's time
Choose your fate!!!

No more waiting hanging on
Grab a hold of it all
Life is waiting take it's wings
Push the darkness down

All our lives we thrive to live
There's always obstacles
Challenge is stay afloat
And find closure to it all

Sadness owns you look away
Close your eyes to the hordes
Failing pasts can be left, forgot
Make your struggles nothing more

All our lives we thrive to live
There's always obstacles
Challenge is stay afloat
And find closure in it all

Death has set it free!!!

Escape, resist, choices
Calling

Decide, outcome, it's time
Waiting

Escape, resist, choices
Calling

Decide, outcome, it's time
Choose your fate!!!

Buried in tombs of emotions
A grief intensified
It lurks around and grabs ahold
Of an unsafe mental mind

Will you calm it slow it down
Frenzy strong indeed
Find the power find the strength
Stand up, face the gloom

Hurricane of dark emotion
Spins rabid through and through
Unlock the courage from it's grasp
Let life live on through you

Can you calm slow it down
Frenzy strong indeed
Find the power find the strength
Stand up and face the gloom

The funeral parlours secret!!!

Losing time you must react
Slipping mind grows short
Broken thoughts do you no good
You have lost this mental war

All our lives we thrive to live
There's always obstacles
Challenge is to stay afloat
And find closure to it all

Lack of action leaves you lost
Mind is swollen shut
Walls now closing it's too late
Forever deaths door staying locked

All our lives we thrive to live
There's always obstacles
Challenge is to stay afloat
And find closure to it all

Death has set it free!!!

Unsure, too late, past tense
Closure

No time, declined, your mind
No thought

Unsure, too late, past tense
Closure

No time, declined, your mind
Slows you down
