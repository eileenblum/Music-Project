Sense the fate that's in hand feel the wheels stop turning
Confirmed blood is dead stop the flesh and bone
I think it's quite intriguing these thoughts we wonder
The end comes much too soon pulse is running slow

There's no real knowledge of this lingering feeling in our veins
There's no real identity to it all...

As present as all this is no one real word describes it
Feelings of something more goes ripping through the brain
I think it's quite intriguing constant thoughts of what is out there
Some things, some times never to be explained!

There's no real knowledge of this lingering feeling in our veins
There's no real identity to it all.
Very alone yet inside of us it is more then just a feeling
For with every birth one day there is goodbye!

Inflicted by the curse of doom sands of time delivered
Some things, some times never to be explained!

There's no real knowledge of this lingering feeling in our veins
There's no real identity to it all.
Very alone yet inside of us it is more then just a feeling
For with every birth one day there is goodbye!

Missing pulse now freshly cut transplanted life somewhere else
It strays away to joyous cells completely unattached to flesh and bone

Missing pulse now passed away tainted senses find demise
Pulse beat prisoner with the stare production halted and compromised

We must prepare for that one time day to exact the things we fear
Face the truth we're all death's children growing to die
And there is nothing in this world that can stop the death of life
For with every birth one day there is goodbye
Missing a pulse!!!

Present as all this I, no one real word describes it
Feelings of something more goes ripping through the brain
I think it's quite intriguing constant thoughts of what is out there
Some things, some times just never to be explained!

There's no real knowledge of this lingering feeling in our veins
There's no real identity to it all.
Very alone yet inside of us it is more then just a feeling
For with every birth one day there is goodbye
Missing a pulse!!!
