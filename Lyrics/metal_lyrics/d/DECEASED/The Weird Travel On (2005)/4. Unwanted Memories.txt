Unimagined scenarios
Stain my living mind
Feed this into the thought machine
Of anyone but me

Take this pain take it all away
And rid forever from my mind
Take from me
Unwanted memories

Unsettled direction
Is where my mind cant go
Shut it down or witness now
The grasp of lunacy

Take this pain take it all away
And rid forever from my mind
Take from me unwanted memories
I will not live insanity
I can't defeat my mind
Nail up the door to my horror
Leave it all behind

Leave it all behind
Unwanted memories
I will not live insanity
I can't defeat my mind
Nail up the door to my horror
Leave it all behind

I live for life i can't deal with this
Smothering my days
The thoughts that sit there in my mind
Life is so restrained

Take this pain take it all away
And rid forever from my mind
Take from me unwanted memories
I will not live insanity
I can't defeat my mind
Nail up the door to my horror
Leave it all behind

Leave it all behind
Unwanted memories

Over and over it tears away at me
Can't stop it now it owns my mind unwanted memories

Then suddenly it comes to me
On how to clear my mind
I'll join these pictures in my thoughts
I welcome suicide

Suicide
No more memories
I now can die with sanity
I did defeat my mind
Nailed up the door to my horror
It's all been left behind

Replacing all the worst of times
With the curing act of death
All of this just memory now
The non-thinking man lives best
