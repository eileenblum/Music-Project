Disfigured alone the other side of me I've seen myself from inside
Turned around I face identity it's the only shadow in my past
On this new day I approach it from the outside inside wants nothing more
From me

Transplant ready
Keeping what it wants from me
The change is coming
What will be kept when all is done?

Is the image even broken staring back at me or is the aura just showing
What's inside?
No one can ever tell you which image is correct the only one that's sure
Is no one
Reflections of a person an existence of the flesh but flesh is worthless
Without mind

Transplant ready
Keeping what it wants from me
Change is coming
What will be kept when all is done?

The fears I fear yet never have I made the change
For years and years yet every day it ends the same
Lost touch lost time I'm growing older not so wise
Mature, naive, and every day it ends the same

Lost touch lost time I'm growing older not so wise
Mature, naive, this really has to end

I've uncovered more to the stagnate man detached the holding shell
There's a million ways to rebuild the mind an always changing force

Through trial and error thought for thoughts there's a feel I'm looking for
A connected aura trying to take hold just a little more

Now caught in a brainstorm thoughts all locked away right here at the
Start now I stand
Maybe I'll find at some other time my ways can never be changed
This lesson I've taken is nothing new at all keeping face just the best
That I can

Transplant failure
Keeping all that is me
Makes no changes
I've kept it all for I am me!!!

The fears I fear yet never have I made the change
For years and years yet every day it ends the same
Lost touch lost time I'm growing older not so wise
Mature, naive, and every day it ends the same

Lost touch lost time I'm growing older not so wise
Mature, naive, today wont end the same

Behind the faces which we own sits a long lost entity
Beyond the mask we hide our pain through the faces that we keep
