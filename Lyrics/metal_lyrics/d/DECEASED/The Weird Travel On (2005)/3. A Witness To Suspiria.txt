Enslaved!!!

Discordant, enchanting, morbid yet focused firm
A whisper of evil sounds ghastly and disturbed
Flamboyant disturbing the shock attracts me there
Ring master the leader three ring torture abattoir

Prepare for the abattoir!

There's sickness in numbers so terribly deranged
No eager resistance to pull my soul away
A matrix that guides them tells me that all wrong is right
Subconscious has held out apprehension fails

Prepare for the abattoir!

Suspirian planet summons me to go to them
They force me to follow I have no choice I'm now its slave

Enslaved!

A witness to...suspiria
From my skull explodes my eyes
And there they roll across the land
A witness to..suspiria
Fragile quest lies right ahead
On I go into this world

Enslaved!

A witness to...suspiria
Madness looms through visuals
What I see I can't explain

I just can't explain

Discordant, enchanting, morbid yet focused firm
A whisper of evil sounds ghastly and disturbed
Flamboyant disturbing the shock attracts me there
Ring master the leader three ring torture abattoir

Fed to the abattoir!

Suspirian planet summons me to go to them
They force me to follow I have no choice I'm now its slave

A slave, their slave, insane in suspiria!!!
