A spell bounding moment sure to end in fright
A scenario of awful things
Clinging always to my mind, living always in my mind
Why wait the final outcome I know it's here for me
The fork is waiting in the road
Clinging always to my mind, living always in my mind

In us all there's terror in us all there's fear
To face this all together every part of me is scared
My heartbeats growing faster and my skin is turning pale
Fright is truly what I am beware I must beware

Charging is the terror and striking are my fears
I see it coming closer now
Clinging always to my mind, living always in my mind
For me I can't avoid it no safety to my grave
Within myself I feel the scare
Clinging always to my mind, living always in my mind

(moving and turning moving and turning)
I scream for this to go away
(moving and turning moving and turning)
Let this all just go away

(moving and turning moving and turning)
Like scary pictures in a dream
(moving and turning moving and turning)
Oh how I wish this was a dream

I hear them now they call to me my hearing's full of fright
Torture building in my brain with their never ending cries, never
Ending cries

I see them now they look at me my seeing's full of fright
The torture building in my brain a never ending sight, never ending sight

Upon me now it's happened the terror clings to me
It's taken hold not letting go
Clinging always to my mind, living always in my mind
The road is there before me I'm heading into fear
The traveled road awaits me now
Clinging always to my mind, living always in my mind

In us all there's terror in us all there's fear
To face this all together every part of me is scared
My heartbeats growing faster and my skin is turning pale
Fright truly what I am beware I must beware

BEWARE, BEWARE!!!
