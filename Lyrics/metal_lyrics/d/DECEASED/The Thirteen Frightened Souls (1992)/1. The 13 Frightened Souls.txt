The shocking truth the 13 souls the time ticks
peacefully. A horrid tale a frightful day now locked in
history. As one by one the chosen gone some final
place they'll stay. Forever lost as all stands still and
weirdness claims it's prey.
Into the air they disappear the 13 souls erased. No
horrid thought was left unthought no boundaries
were untraced. The years have passed but nothing's
changed an unsolved piece of time.
The 13 frightened souls!!
Unmasking those marked to go was there a reason
why? Eerie choices random death is no one's quest
replied? Just what controls the course of all, lead us
to the one? Is there a being a martyr lord to change
all destiny? Can we believe in all truth that there's
no other life? Beyond our time beyond our world
beyond our seeing eyes.
13, calling
A texture made of demise, uncertainty of the soul,
the horrible task of fate. 13 the number of fear,
refusal to believe the beyond, existence of darkness
unknown.....
13!!! 13!!! 13!!! 13!!!
