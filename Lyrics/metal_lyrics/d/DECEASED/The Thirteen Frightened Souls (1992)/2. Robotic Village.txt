What will become of a world where so few know?
Most lives escaped their without soul. The Earth is full
or robot minds. But who controls thought decline?
Detached senseless life brothers. They march pro-
grammed by others. In life forever they follow. In
death another lives shadow.....
Blind, exist without a mind. In trance a corpse of
time. Never knowing why. Never knowing why.
Never knowing why. Never knowing what their
thoughts unknown will be. Now obey.....
Obey in the robotic village!!!!!
