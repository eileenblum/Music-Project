It's not the end, we are suffering on. An endless
world filled with pain, how we hate the pain. Mentally
slaughtered by evil, and disturbed are our minds.
But we shall return all the madness, for soon is our
time.....
We are our savior, the only one!!!
The air is toxic to breath, the skies have all come
undone. Will anyone see the next century, but was it
really to come? Seasons and weather will vanish,
and so will the once burning sun. Never again is god
going to win, for the downfalls already begun.....
Nuclear Exorcist!!!
