Empty world of nothing universe of the past. Silent
place of mourning history of mishaps. Wipe away
the future for it is gone forever.
Gone forever.....
Earth.....A dying future
Earth.....A barren wasteland
Earth.....Forgotten hellhole
The planet graveyard!!!
Empty world of nothing doom has come and then
gone. Planet graveyard buried drained of life for so
long. Torn apart by mankind life just couldn't go on.
Could not go on.....
And so the planet dies!!!
Entire world is gone!
Into the void they go!
The funerals' begun!
Begun!!!
