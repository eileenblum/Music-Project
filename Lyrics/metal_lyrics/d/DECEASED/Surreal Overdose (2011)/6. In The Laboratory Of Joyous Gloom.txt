Thanks for the mind expansion
The world seems a little colder now
In the darkest corner of the dark corner
Sits a friend I've never known well
Wasn't well no warmth, no sun
Til the rodent invaded my mind
This little voice sifts through
Thoughts in my head starts carving
Away at me

I need haunting worlds to twist my mind
For the eeriness must creep
No reaching hand just the still of night
Dripping from gloom's I.V.

In the dead of night through the light of day
Darkness stood it's ground
As anxious feelings kept feeding my dreams
To become what once was me
I grasped the dark and took its charge
In my universe I flew so high
But a predetermined waiting fate
Now comes to claim its prize

With my mind undone I'd found my peace
As the eeriness crept through me
No reaching hand just the still of night
Dripping from gloom's I.V.

And now I'm seeing this vision
It sits looming, peering at me
I smash the lights out close my eyes
Hoping it goes away
It starts speaking in words I cannot follow
It holds out its hand for embrace
I wish it dead in a box deep underground
And a million miles away

I need haunting worlds to twist my mind
For the eeriness must creep
The reaching hand has been shunned away
I'm holding out for what comes next

And now they tell me I'm crazy
They've studied the brains in me
I know that I'm fine controlling my life
Yet they question all that I do

Upon me is this illness and its overtaking me
Please go away and leave me to doom
Why won't it let me be me?

Oh how I cherished that feeling and
Oh how I cherished that high
Locked away like a germ or a world
Ending plague removed from what I crave
And now I've found this horror
Or maybe it's found me
Pushing words of hope and happiness
I'm repulsed it's so ugly

In the laboratory of joyous gloom
Science turns on me
They say I've strayed from the
Rational lost in mystery
Keep on hoping keep on waiting
These feelings grab me I am wits end
In the laboratory of joyous gloom
Science turns on me
They say I've strayed from the
Rational lost in mystery
Clinging desperately I wait for the
Moment when will it come?
I breathe for it and bask in it
Don't leave me now my long anointed
World misery

The time has come!!

Don't leave me now forever we're
Bound by one and only dear friend
Together alone we'll fend off the
Fiend that has gathered to finish our mind
All torment is gone my dream has come true
I've patched up this hole in my mind
Please tell me you're listening
I've patched up this hole in my mind!

The end, the end, the end, the end...
Of my needing and wanting of you
The end, the end, the end, the end...
To the grand scheme of living the fool
The end, the end, the end, the end...
The end to this damaged brain
The end, the end, the end, the end...
Self-removal from life and this pain
The end, the end, the end, the end...
Bringing of cheer to my chewed up mind
The end, the end, the end, the end
THE END!!!
