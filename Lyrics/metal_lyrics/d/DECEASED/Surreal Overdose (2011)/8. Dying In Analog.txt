I'm turning pale as I'm told the news
That a death has crept in me
In terminal bliss my life cut short
And now my soul is numb

Sunken cheeks and yellowed skin
I've seen the horrible ways of disease
So scared, alone as my anger grows
Yet tears become my eyes

Welcome to terminal end
The doctors informed me it's my grave
The beauty in growing up when I did
I look back a young man and smile a kid
I'm dying, slowly dying under
The force of my terminal world
As the old man loves the young man
Cries dying in analog

My family and loved ones scared and
Afraid for this sudden change to my life
I can't have tomorrow to fix yesterday
This moment is all that I have
I'm dying, slowly dying under
The force of my terminal world
As the old man loves the young man
Cries dying in analog

Living... death be not proud
Dying... the end of my days
Living... the force I must obey

I'm dying, slowly dying under
The force of my terminal world
As the old man loves the young man
Cries dying in analog

Living... death be not proud
Dying... the end of my days
Living... a wounded soul
As the end has come for me
Its turning my spirit to see those like me
Eaten by disease
So much for the health so much for life
Forever from dust to decay

There's no time to understand the
Scare within my heart
Yes my termination has been aroused
By fears of mortality
I dream for the past so set in my ways
While the living are dreaming beyond
But death should be peaceful
A heartfelt goodbye
And free from prolonged agony

A few more hours, lasting minutes
Or maybe seconds more
I turn and stir and wonder why still
It's time for me
My vision fading, dimming down
All around me running slow
My precious family sits and cries
As disease destroys my life

I motion my loved ones to stand by my side
At deathbed attempting to speak
The feeling the need to settle the pains
From the hurts betrayals from me
I pour from the heart to those that I love
As I struggle to die feeling peace
With them I reflect and make my amends
As poorly my dying heart beats

Slowly the power bestowed by the fear
Awakes and harvests in me
Surely this is because I'm afraid
Afraid of beyond, afraid of the fear
Where will it take me? my final need
Is to find out at last the one truth
And then it becomes me passing away
It arrives along with death's stare

In life remembered
Gone forever
Gone forever down to the earth
That brought me to life,
On to heareafter
With grace by my side
Far from above be-stilled
Underground numb to the living
Peaceful and sound
A funeral of life, a name on a grave
Yet forever the memories sing...
