first appearing as suggestion it's hunched into their minds
as sickened ones gathered weak and viewed as saddened tales
its pact to halt the living brings ones freedom down to size
as lifeless corpses turning pale decomposing on healths floor

brought here by an illness a mass of squirming brains
this awful way of letting go lets all taboos fade away

in a mental home it's nested right down that lonely hall
a room of persons unattached to all that brings us life, sadly time has come

to the uncaring they're an eyesore to loved ones constant care
for doctors it's a challenge of what's lurking down inside, creeping down inside...

to the children they are creepy, quiet, odd, and frail
misunderstood, misdiagnosed, what made this sickened brood?

what on earth could bring them to this awful state of mind?
what brought such hell into our world?, the strangled wheelchair sits!

we can feel the change surround them in that stare we can rely
we hide our tears to shelter them yet they see not what we see
it broods along in selective minds this kindred assembly
to adhere fresh-killed to live in the vice
forcing minds to slowly walk the horrid, lonely path of dementia

locked far away from all the world this kindred assembly
to adhere fresh-killed to live in the vice
forcing minds to slowly walk the horrid, lonely path of dementia

unknowing, uncaring they smile through it all as the doors to humanity close
it lives to kill and kills at will it waits to serve the insane

don't let this invasion of madness around you destroy your living soul
while the blood of unknown keeps falling over us all, let it fall, let it fall!
these nightmares that haunt them could haunt you if this hell comes looking your way
you must go with your heart and prepare for what might await

this beast from hell refreshes morose and feeds forever upon our dying earth...

a loss of all surroundings, do they know that it's their time?
for as i speak a lonely soul routinely dies again

locked far away from all the world this kindred assembly
to adhere fresh-killed to live in the vice
forcing lives to slowly walk the eternal moving only path to hell, this hell ,all hell, in
