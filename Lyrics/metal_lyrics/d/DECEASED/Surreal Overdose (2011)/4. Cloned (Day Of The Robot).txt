Through scientific nightmares
We've acquired the skills to recreate
As they multiply they must then divide
Then they'll multiply again
Sequence after sequence
They can't leave what's wrong alone
But now the numbers all fit
The figures they match
For better or for worse it seems
We'll all be cloned

A crazy science
Euthanized defective clones
All questions unanswered
The stalemate is no more
Zygote mutations and a
Clinching fist of DNA
They hail their revolution
They hail mutated prey
Hail!

Hail! All hail mutated revolution!
Hail! All hail the clones are marching on...

From one matter to another
Robotic sources taking form
From their clonus beginnings
They developed scarred and frail
Inhuman conditions
Mechanized distorted ways
They hail their revolution
They hail mutated prey!
Hail!

Hail! All hail mutated revolution!
Hail! All hail the clones are marching on...
Hail! All hail mutated revolution!
Hail! All hail the robotic moving ones

Conveyor belts, steep inclines
A moving floor system
From outlaw formed lab coat
Factories of the crazed

In man built pods they fall
Right down the line
Staggered, mute, but
Perfectly arranged

Genetic uniformed individuals
Come marching down the line
In disarray
Mix transfection, add ligation
Once human now becomes
Mutated prey

Tell all the world they'll soon be cloned
Shocked will be the world when they're cloned

Their interest in our DNA
Incubates in futuristic stew
As retro-grade weirdos
Breathe out their days
With their filthy hands
Deep in life's womb

A crazy science
Euthanized defective clones
All questions unanswered
The stalemate is no more
Zygote mutations and a
Clinching fist of DNA
They hail their revolution
They hail mutated prey
Hail!

Hail! All hail mutated revolution!
Hail! All hail the clones are marching on...
Hail! All hail mutated revolution!
Hail! All hail the robotic moving ones
Hail! All hail!!
Hail! All hail!!
The clones are marching strong!!
