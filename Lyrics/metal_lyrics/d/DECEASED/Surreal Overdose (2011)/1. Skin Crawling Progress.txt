A skin crawling process comes
Reaching from the grave
Through uneasiness and vengeful
Greed we must mourn our day and age

It's on the rise and it's always there
Creates demise as it creates despair

As we show the world in grievance
It answers every lie
It stretches truth and twists its tail
And it always tricks our minds
A disease that brings disease
Will be the punishment at hand
For dead welcomed truths
Revert to lies as only liars can

It's on the rise and it's always there
Creates demise as it creates despair
It attacks the world in so many ways
Skin crawling forward crawling
Forward towards the grave

Let me paint you a picture of a bright
Unscathed new world
Where mankind would live in joyous
Peace and cherish his life on Earth
Our children would play in safety
And real love would own our hearts
True sincerity lives away from greed
And killing's not just a word
But this is not the case
For I've seen our human race
Death, revenge as the sniper awaits
Its next prey
Fear, full-nerved and it's never, ever
Going away

This skin crawling process marches
Up and down the spine
It shows its claws, it rattles nerves,
It presents itself the leetch
It's almost undramatic for most
Have felt its wicked ways
So bow your heads and linger on
While sadness leads the way

It's on the rise and it's always there
Creates demise as it creates despair
It attacks the world in so many ways
Skin crawling forward reaching
Pulling, screaming from the grave

We're pulling dead children from sewers
As our hospitals kill the patients they serve
We're witnessing minds polluted each day
As we run from ourselves once again

But there's a miracle cure for the future
A breakthrough, a revolution
They've got plans for a better tomorrow
Oh they've got plans for us all in the end

Now let me paint you reality's picture
It's a dark unbending world
Where this killing's forever and the
Downfall of man has gotten bad will
Only get worse
And this is us today
For you too have seen the human race
Death, revenge as the sniper has
Claimed its next prey
Fear, full-nerved and it's never, ever
Going away

This skin crawling process marches
Up and down the spine
It shows its claws, it rattles nerves,
It presents itself the leetch
It's almost undramatic for most
Have felt its wicked ways
So bow your heads and linger on
While sadness leads the way

So believe in these things you are
Seeing keep a watchful eye on it all
You can trust no one friend or foe
And that includes yourself my friend

It's on the rise and it's always there
Creates demise as it creates despair
It attacks the world in so many ways
Skin crawling forward reaching
Pulling, downward to our graves

And it's never, ever, going away
