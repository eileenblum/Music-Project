Hissing like serpents, rabid and crazed
Nuclear evil, thrives on the brain
Army of madness, grown from the dead
Creatures of horror, contaminated
Beware your mind
Coven of mutants, mass twitching fiends
Vampire killers, attacking unseen
Winged mangled monsters, take to flight
The taste for thought, brings delight
Beware your mind
Fiends, brains, blood, red
Strange, weird, dark and dead
Born from the womb of radiation,
an embryo of nuclear man
Straight from the grave of dark energy
The weak contaminated.....now!!!
Mind vampires, mind vampires
A whirlpool of atomic death, with nowhere to hide
Ravaged skulls of knowing life, torn out from inside
Brainless you drop, as all your thoughts now stop
A victim forever unpure
Worthless to live, your life you now give
Possessed you fall to the floor
Beware your mind!!!
