Deep in the mind, you slowly unwind
For reasons unknown, there's disturbance inside
Diluting this virgin brain, killing the thinking man,
Sanity tries to last, real world decides to stop
Enter madness, afraid your life isn't yours, as sickness greeds
Enter madness, the normal Earth looking wrong, destiny!!!
Twisting, muting, the loss of a living mind
Enter madness, with no control all is done, as hope retreats
Enter madness, and in the end there's no chance,
But true defeat
Feeling the reaper close in,
Speeding the distance of death before thee
In terror the mindless must sit,
knowing the end has now come
The end has now come!!!
Twisting, muting, schizophrenia, paranoia, twisting, muting
Madness
Dead minds
The blueprints, the blueprints, the blueprints,
The blueprints for madness
