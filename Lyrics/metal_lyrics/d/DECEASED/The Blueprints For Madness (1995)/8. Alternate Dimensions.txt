Feeling the moment at hand, in this dimension
A siege of overcome fear, a needle of medicine weird
I visit my mind from afar, it floats weak, sick in a jar
The pain, the strength, to fight
This lesson of deviate kind
Drugs, with time are weak, my mind returns to me
the glory of suffering, a pig, and live to think again
I visit my mind from inside, growing and thinking with I
The pain, the strength, to fight
Has saved me from turning inside
Dancing with fiends, disturbing fiends, almost insane,
But chance comes again
Adrift in between, moving unseen, fragile and weak,
Haunted by things that no one shold see
Amazing sadness, the grip of madness, to be the madman
The pig of lesson and depression, at war with illness
The straps are lifted, the fear now distant, I am alive!!!
The slumber, the funeral for that mind
The hold unleashed, the madness free, forever onward
Lock up the dark side of life, what's real is what's deep inside
Reality comes from the mind, release and fall from the light
Mystery brings the destruction of mind
Misery's creeping, enticing decline
Ignore the strangers of doom, the outcome is all up to you
Believe in all that is wise or madly adrift you will fly
Down!!!
