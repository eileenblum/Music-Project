A vision of intensity, the bringer of cruel velocity
And the angel of sorrow will fly
Witness this horror unveiled, the story, this every day tale
The ending of precious mankind, as powerful darkness unwinds
It searched for man, to truth his fear
To haunt the night without a care
An act of evil, an act of shock
An ugly end, the fall of life
At one with death, black wreaths surround this evil game
Round and round, the reaper's voice now calls your name
Negative darkness fills the air and grasps the soul
Fall from Earth and join the ranks of those before you
The chosen one, to complete fate
A life long fear, you won't escape
The instant end, a murdered corpse
With eyes of tears, the loved ones cry
Negative darkness (negative), negative darkness (darkness)
Negative darkness (negative), darkness!!!
Negative darkness (negative), darkness!!!
Madly, drifting ghoul, you are the parasite
Thrill seeking fiend, the living devil's mind
Morbid killing man, you're now the haunting night
Dark and moving slow, the twisted stalking fright
Torn and churning mind, the twisted stalking fright
Living for the dead, the rotting stinking dead
Torn and churning mind, the twisted stalking fright
Living for the dead, the rotting stinking dead
Forever you shall stalk, on Earth, in the dark
The killer in the night, twisted stalking fright
Death lives on, deep in the mind!!!
