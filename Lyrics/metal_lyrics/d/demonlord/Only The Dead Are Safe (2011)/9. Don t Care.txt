I still remember all those days
When we used to share our space and time
And money â I have made
I still can smell your sweet perfume
And it reminds me of all the lies and hate and shit
You put me through

You wonât have any place to hide
I can put you naked on my site
And I still have your credit card

You better cry!

Donât care if you think that I can not get over
Donât care if you jump into your new friendâs Rover
Donât care if you think it was a sad goodbye
Youâre just a temporary file in my life

Donât care if you think that I will fight for nothing
Donât care if you cry, be sure that Iâll be laughing
Donât care if you think it was a sad goodbye
Youâre just a temporary file in my life

You made me drudge around the clock
Through thick and thin - you said, but somehow
All the good parts you forgot
You made me want you more and more
I thought your love's an ocean
But have you tried to swim in an empty pool?

And now I'm getting oh' so right
Your pics look pretty on my site
And my drinks are on you tonight
