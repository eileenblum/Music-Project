She, she got this smile
She kills you with her eyes
She turns you inside out
Nothing's impossible for her

She got your life
She moved into your mind
There's no turning back
She's so irresistible

Right now,
You forget to run for another one
She's the only one in sight
You lost the game
Youâre hypnotized
You drink the lies
Youâre sinking in
The demon within

When she talks
She lies
When she gives
You'll get nothing

She cries
And you give
When she leaves
Youâll have nothing

Now you slowly realize
She keeps you mesmerized
You wanted to do it right
She was your only one

Man, she had the skills
Sheâs gone with your dreams
Left no falling tears
But emptiness in your heart

She gets what she needs
Doesnât care what you feel
When youâll get nothing
She'll be laughing

Its her game that you play
She knows what to say
You know whatâs coming
Youâll get nothing
