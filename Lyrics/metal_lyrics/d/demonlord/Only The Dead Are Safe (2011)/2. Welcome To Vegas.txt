Welcome to Vegas
If you see us
You're on the damn right place
Here you can buy
Self-execution
'Couse it sells with a smiley face

No way out for losers
And the winners will stay forever
One more game
One more choice
One more check
One more fold
One more life
For the all in

If i win if i lose
If risk is what i choose
I live on the edge and
I break all the rules
I can fall i can fly
There's no chance to rebuy
One more turn on the wheel
And my fateâs getting real

Don't have to save us
We're fine in Vegas
And the prize is worth the wait

If you can get
The right information
You'll be the shark and not the bait
