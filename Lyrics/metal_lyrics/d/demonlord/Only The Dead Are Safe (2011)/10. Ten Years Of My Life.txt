Not a rumor
Not a joke
I went through my life story and wrote
To sum my feelings
I'll be late
I've been passed by this last decade

I have cheated
I have lied
I pushed my way and all aside
All I wanted
I achieved
Still I have to consider it is...
It's to be...

Ten years of my life
It's a sin, it's a lie
Ten years of my life
It is hate, it's a crime

I see my future
I see my past
I have fallen and have to fall at last

To search for glory
Search for lust
Now I'm pleased but haunted by the past

I have cheated
I have lied
I pushed my way and everything I tried
All I wanted
I achieved
Still I have to consider it is...
It's to be...

Ten years of my life
It's a sin, it's a lie
Ten years of my life
It is hate, it's a crime

Ten years of my life
It's a sin, it's a lie
Ten years of my life
It is faith, it's a fight

I've lived in the shades and I've touched the sun
Taken my chances, been on the run
Too many faces around me to know

Got lost in my life, found myself again
Was the toughest of all and a broken man
Still on my feet and Iâm ready to go
