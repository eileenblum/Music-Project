This is not my way
Ain't doin' what you say
You're binding my soul
Enslaving the whole
Get out off the rock!

You're reaching everywhere
You're poisoning the air
We want you no more
Enslaving the whole
Get out off the rock!

Usurers,bloodsuckers,
Demigods,rats
Get out off the rock!

There will come the day
When you'll be blown away
Exploiting the scene
You sure know what I mean

Get out of the rock!

A change is yet to come
Utilizers on the run
We're eager to fight
So we'll kick you out of the rock

Oh, you'll see the fire burn
Don't you dare to take a turn
You transgressed your competence
Banned by the congress of rock!
