The girls are wearing leather and the
Guys are wearing steel
This is the way they wanna feel

The pathos of the night
The power of the sound
But i'll stay on solid ground

The band on the stage
The beer in my hand
This is the way to the promised land
The band on the dock
I'm in the bar
This is the way of buffet rock

The girls and boys are drunk of the
Cheapest coke and wine
They are making war for the first line

But i never have this fear
I clearly see and hear
From the bar
And Iâm also pleased by my beer
I love the band with a
Beer in my hand
This is the way to the promised land
The band on the dock
I'm in the bar
This is the way of the buffet rock
