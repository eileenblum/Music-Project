I feel the nights are getting longer
I see the turning of the wheel
I have the urge, itâs getting stronger
Follow the sun, this must be real

I hear the voices from the darkness
Theyâre calling so loud
Predators out there for a kill
They scream and you shout
Countdown is ticking down
And so does my time
The reaperâs job gives me the thrill

Itâs time to arrive
I feel so alive
Get away, stay away
Stay strong tonight

It must be a lie
Just give me a sign
On the way, will you stay
Stay strong tonight

I have the answers for all questions
I have the right one by my side
Itâs me again, I canât be wrong now
My hungerâs rising high tonight

I still hear voices from the darknessâ¦.
