My life's an empty page
I'm forced into this cage
I must repress my rage
Life's a pharisee's stage

I know the Demon is livin' in me
I crush him I cannot be free

I let the Demon
I let him out
Let the Demon out
I feel the Evil
He lives in me
Let the Demon free

The pain, I give to him
The pain he gives within
The force that locks him up
The force that wears me out

I know the Demon is livin' in me
I crush him I cannot be free
