Your door's locked from inside
To close you in the dark
The walls around you are built of hate

Your world's closing you in
No way; no out and no in
To break out from this you will be late

Beyond your hell there is no heaven
You are too proud and blind to see

I know you're fallen asleep
To wake you I am so weak
I have to open your eyes
And make you realize the world you live in

Your soul's cold as the ice
Alone you sacrifice
You make the outside world pass you by

This way leads you nowhere
You're lost, should be aware
You have to let the real world bring you back

Apart from your hell there is your heaven
Take a step ahead to see

I know you're fallen asleep
To wake you i am so weak
I have to open your eyes
And make you realize the world you live in
