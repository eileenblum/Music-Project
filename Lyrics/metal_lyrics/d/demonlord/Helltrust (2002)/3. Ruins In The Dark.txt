Lights go out everywhere
The world goes down in darkness
Soothe your breath and listen
To the multitude of sounds

Slowly creeping along
Sanity of madness
Solidity, diamond hardness
Moulded from the stones

Just take a walk among them
By the light of the bloodred moon
Mystic circles and runes around and 'round
You gonna understand them soon

Ruins in the Dark - they must be everlasting
Ruins in the Dark - go down and find a passage back

Sounds are holding you down
Everything is silent
Shades are drowning your voice
Erasing all you words

Take care but be aware
Something strange is out there
Get lost deep in the night
In the garden of the ruins

Ruins in the Dark - they must be everlasting
Ruins in the Dark - go down and find a passage
To the realms they must beundreamed
Your way leads you to the Ruins in the Dark

Even the stones can bleed in the night
There's only one way for you to find
