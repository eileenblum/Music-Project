Blackest days are coming
When the earth begins to quake
At one blow we're going downhill with our pride
Impossible to break the walls of frailty in our heart
Will you dare to rebel
Just keep smiling, be polite!

Blackest nights are coming near
The wolf waits at the door
Magnetized by cheap tricks on the screen
Nuclear dust's pouring down, my smile turns into grin
And our faces get dry
Oh, how I miss the rain

Follow me now - into the sunlight
Follow me now - new destination
Follow me now - storm-water's gonna be our purification

Fall on me
Fall on me
Fall on me
Holy water for us to be

Blackest clouds are gathered
Over this muddy place below
We know we're on the rack, we're going down
Sitting in your corner room infected by disease of

indifference
Say everything must be all right

So many faces I know, but I feel so alone
We've lost all our reasons, we're poisoned our souls

Come cover me now, I will surely die
Velvet hands gonna close my eyes

It's hard as a stone, can't bear it alone
Come with me to find out, what's wrong with our lives

Give all the power I need, all the strength to succeed
I will not turn back, to the sun we will rise
