Another day has come
Another afterlife
Once I came through
The moorlands of death

Legions in alliance
Create a dreadful dance
Come and enjoy our madness they said

Still addicted to life
Something to realize
Still I try to fly over the clouds
Blazing sun in my eyes

I harness the winds
They will fly back my soul
Even after the twilight
There's a chance to leave the moor

I hear them calling me
Sensitivity
Blessed are all the
People I love

Just one more human touch
One more moment left
Hallowed be all the tears
They have wept

Still addicted to life
Something to realize
The call is too strong
It's screaming so loud
Oh, it tears me apart

I harness the winds
They will fly back my soul
Even after the twilight
There's a chance to leave the moor

The moon is compass
Returning back home
Even after the twilight
There's a chance to leave the moor
