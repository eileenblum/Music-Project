Here comes the nightmare
That never ends
In the grown of revelry the untouched to blind
And pure will be buried in the tomb of deception

Strong enough to stand like a stone
Sweet-evil temptations some don't hear your call
But the week will be swallowed by the moor of corruption

Dance through the hall into the circle of light
Dance on in frenzy your own eyes to blind - in the killing light

Just don't negotiate show your strength it's not too late
Don't take the bypass only walk proud and straight
Our world rots from inside, arm your heart for the one last fight
And in the end we will unravel the secrets of our lives

Where - Where do we go, if future's in sight
We gonna get it with the speed of light
Where do we go, if future's in sight
We gonna get it with the speed of light

Time will tell if there's a way that can be seen through my eyes
Time will swear the oath to fight, if future's in shit

I am a soldier, I was a slave
From ravenous breakdown no one is safe
Sigh a prayer for not to be burned by the flames of destruction

Strong enough to stand like a stone
Sweet-evil temptations some don't hear your call
But the week will be swallowed by the moor of corruption

Dance through the hall into the circle of light
Dance on in frenzy your own eyes to blind - in the killing light
