In the name of God
We have to baptize and conquer
The holy land
Soldiers in battlelines
Bring belief to the east
Words don't heal but the steel

Sanction to killing, and condemn the innocent
We are engaged to the beast

Why should I kill, who has to die
Does the law come from the sky
I need a beam of light to keep me alive
Is there a higher might to end
This everlasting fight
For the kingdom of lies

Under the sign of the cross
We are just marching on
Our banners fly in the wind
Swords and sabers
The unholy have to fall
Praise the heavenly king

Why should I kill, who has to die
Does the law come from the sky
I need a beam of light to keep me alive
Is there a higher might to end
This everlasting fight
For the kingdom of lies

Why should I kill, who has to die
Does the law come from the sky
I need a beam of light to keep me alive
Is there a higher might to end
Who never surrenders will die
For the kingdom of lies
