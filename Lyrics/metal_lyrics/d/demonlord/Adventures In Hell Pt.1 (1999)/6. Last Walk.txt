I tried to destroy the walls of the Romans
As head of barbarian tribes
I tried to hide from the soldiers of Herod
To escort Icarus on his flight

I tried to ruin Egyptian pyramids
To incite revolt among the slaves
I tried to constrain the armies of Spartacus
To open again Eden's gates

I look to the skies
I ask the Gods "oh why?"
Who's writing my fate?
But everything I do, just won't turn out right

I tried to raze the great Rom to the ground
And let the soldiers sow it with salt
I tried to walk straight into the lion's den
Even if it's my last walk

"My fate is already written
I'm going to meet the other side
Now I face death
And this is my last walk"

My last walk and I meet the other side
My last walk on the path of my life
But no one can say that I was just
a brick in the wall

My last walk and I step into another world
My last walk on the path of my life
But no one can say that I was just
the one, the rebeller

(Everything in my life will change
A neverending journey I just start
Everything in my life will change
On the path of my life)
