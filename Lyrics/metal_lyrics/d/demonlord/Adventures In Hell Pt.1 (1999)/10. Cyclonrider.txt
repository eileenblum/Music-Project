Feel, the air is getting hot
Into the shock
The sky is ripped in two
See the pumping of blood
Ears getting deaf
By the pressure in you

I know he owes the skies nothing at all
Forces of dust are taking control

There's only one man in the storm
No one can fight him, oh not anymore
Watch him defending our lives
On the cyclone he rides

Still these forces to keep
In unholy league
Salvation to find
He kills the wicked with steel
He knows no retreat
Tornadoes he rides

Raindrops are blinding his eyes
On the Cyclon he rides
