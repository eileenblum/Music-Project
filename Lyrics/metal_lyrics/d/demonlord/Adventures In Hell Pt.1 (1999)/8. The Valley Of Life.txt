Long time ago, as my father died
And I was just a child
I wasn't believed in fairy tales
I put them on one side

My father was a dreamer
But one day in my life
I took all his words for granted
As he told me about the valley of life

Across the great desert
Miles from here
Where the sun goes down
Beyond the hill

Valley of life - I have to search it
Valley of life - Somewhere far beyond
Whit my crowning effort, and with all
of my power
I will find the valley of life

On his death-bed my father said me
You don't have more time
You have to be strong and young enough
To get eternal life

Thousand soldiers by my side
Across the great desert we ride
Thousand days and thousand nights
We're about the valley to find
