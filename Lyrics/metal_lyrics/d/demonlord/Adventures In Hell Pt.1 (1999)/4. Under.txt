My trembling hands try to catch the shadows
Which want to escape from me
It proves too soon and I think he knows
That my mind is sinking in eddies of sea

I never tried to find the answers
to my own decay
Now you're gone, my mind is
crawling in slow eclipse
That once took me ease

Ebony-faced morning is coming
Hope fades away out of my eyes
It proves too soon and I think he knows
I became a slave, where evil presides

Under the power of evil, under the ice
Falling angels are hunting,  gathering my cries
