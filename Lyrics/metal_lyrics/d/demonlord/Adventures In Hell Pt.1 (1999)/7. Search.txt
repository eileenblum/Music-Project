Searching for the secret for so many years
When he was a young and strong man
To find the key to eternity
was his reason to live
This only wish he could not forget

"To live forever, so what is it for?"
He asked himself, but it didn't give any sense
His restless heart pushed him onwards
On mystical ways
By his own thoughts he was obsessed

The young man is standing right up on the hill
Reaching for help of the gods and the skies
Hungry for knowledge and eternal life
Knowing that this time is right

Years have passed, time after time
Neverending journey for the light
Day by day the will grows even stronger
Fulfill your dream or lose it by pride

On a far-far foreign land, he has travelled to
The magic runes have given the key
He's becoming old he can't wait
But his mind is still awake
"Maybe You my son, You'll find that magic place"

The old man's still standing right up on the hill
Reaching for help of the gods and the skies
Hungry for knowledge and eternal life
Knowing that this time is right
