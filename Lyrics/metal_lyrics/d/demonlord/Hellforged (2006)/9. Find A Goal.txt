Days passing by
I am drinking my beer
In the bar where I'm always
Spending my time

The months passing by
I'm searching for joy
And I live for the moment, and
Enjoy the night

Never had the will to be strong
Never had the chance to be found
I only wish to make plans

God, shake me out of my sleep
Move me out of this slump
Give me the power to act
And make me

Find a goal
To be able to struggle for
Find a goal
To give sense to my life
Find a goal
What am I waiting for
Find a goal
No more wasting my time

The years passing by
Lately nothing have happened
Just waiting for someone
And losing the time
