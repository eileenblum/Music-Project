Headless on an
Endless highway
No farewells
Someday you will find
Your Fortune

Adventures
Heaven and Earth
Calling you
Who could stop you
You're always so sure

You will be so alone my friend
Who will be waiting for you at the end?

Alone under
The dark sky
The Moon will
Never ask you
Who you sleep with

Turning back?
Going nowhere?
Honestly
Could you ever
Feel so sorry?

You will be so alone my friend
Who will be waiting for you at the end?

Consider at your final step
Before the door
Days go by and never come back
Return to nowhere
How could you lose your home
To lose it all
With time the wound gets deep
And you were wrong
You lost your home
You lost our love

Hopeless on an
Endless highway
No control
Will you ever find
Your Fortune

Adventures in Hell
It's for you
no one asked you
You're always so sure

If you ever have this choice
Don't turn back
If you ever find a way back home
If you ever hear the call
Don't come back
You'll be all alone
