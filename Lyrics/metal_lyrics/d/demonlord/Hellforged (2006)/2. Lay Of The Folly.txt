Turn back the light
Getting over the height
Belief is power and guide

Faith in the future
Turns the things right

Disbelief safeguards
Against ardent faith
Idleness is joy

Unbelievingly
Can really enjoy

Is your heart a heart?
Is your soul a soul?
Easy to blame
Blowing out the flame

Bringing light
Endless fight
Empty soul
Empty mind
Bringing light
Shining bright
Burning soul
Genius mind

Turn back the light
Getting over the height
Knowledge is power and pride

Skills, faith and action
Can turn the things right

Folly is safeguard
Against tiring thought
Stupidity is their joy

Faithless and folly
Can only destroy
