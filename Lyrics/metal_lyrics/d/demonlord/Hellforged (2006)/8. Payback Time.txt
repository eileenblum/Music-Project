It's calling
Inside my head
Here in my bone, in my flesh, in my soul

It's painting
My mind so black
Excluding the light of sense from my life

There's so much left to destroy
For the payback time
No! I won't wait so long

Believe me
My game is on
The sense of the story is here in my mind

Sweet vengeance
Keeps me so strong
I bring back the pain to destroy your heart

There's so much left to destroy
For the payback time
No!

I won't wait so long
Beware of my reactions
The iron strikes back soon
As hot as ever
Hail clouds rise above
Waiting for command
You will know that it's the end
The payback time began

Forgiveness
Is not my style
You did what you did and now you must pay

There's no chance
To run or hide
I will bring you the reckoning day
