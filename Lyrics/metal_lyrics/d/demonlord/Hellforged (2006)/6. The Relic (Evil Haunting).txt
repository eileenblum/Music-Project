Eyes of fire
Timeless god
Haunting thoughts
Finally came back to life again
The power remains

Recreates the might it had
Speak those words
Now it's awake and will dance again
In this torrents of pain

Evil haunting
I am to keep far and save my soul
Demons attacking
They want to tie down my soul

Evil haunting
I am to keep far and save my soul
Demons attacking
They never can catch up my soul

Smile in grief
Laugh in fear
Call his name
Reunion of powers is yet to come
By dethroning their god

Wear his mark
Wear his mask
No one knows
No one can tell that you still belong
To his army of blood
