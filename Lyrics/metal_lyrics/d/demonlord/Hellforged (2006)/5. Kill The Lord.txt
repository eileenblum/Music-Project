The sun is rising
The rays bring the ending of the night
The stars are falling
Will be suppressed by the light

This is the cult of the mighty
This is the way of the lord
No chance in direct fighting
Hide away and

Kill the lord
Hide away, watch out and
Kill the lord
We kill the lord

The night is coming
The lord is pushed off from the throne
The stars are shining
The sun is disappearing from the zone

I'll stop the cult of the mighty
I'll break the way of the lord
Won't be embroiled in fighting
Just hide away and

Kill the lord
Hide away, watch out and
Kill the lord
We kill the lord
