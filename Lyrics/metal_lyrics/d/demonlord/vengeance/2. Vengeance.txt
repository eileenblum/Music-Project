I swear it won't take long
when I will cut your through
I won't feel sorry for you
in your very last hour

this pain I can't forget
you took what you could get
I just wanna taste your blood
you've only left to die

I can see your face
every time every place

I am my own savior
don't trust the creator
I take the things in my
own undead hands

I can see your face
I'm sure you'll loose this race

I'll hunt you, I'll hunt you down
Before the mourning comes
Cold hearted, steel hearted
I'll bring you to your knees
My vengeance, my vengeance
Will be like the thunder of god
Cold hearted, black hearted
I'll be your destiny
