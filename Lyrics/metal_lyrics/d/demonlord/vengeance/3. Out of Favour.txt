He came back as the last survivor
From a bloody lost campaign
His body is tired and broken
Only he could endure the pain

On a grey steed with a nicked sword
He rode across the land
To see his king again
And tell about the battles end

The old king formed whit mighty rage
You broke your oath you coward
You had to fight 'till final breath
You damaged my kingdoms honour

Out of favour, out of favour
The punishment is near
Out of favour, out of favour
You can beg you can scream

Disappointment blind illusions in his eyes
He hears again the din of battle painful cries
The souls of fallen soldiers are
Flying to the skies now he must die
