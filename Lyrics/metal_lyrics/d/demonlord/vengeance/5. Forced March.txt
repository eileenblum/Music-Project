You know I have never known
what do you thing
and what do you take me for
I'm of the deepest die
I loose myself,
I loose my self-control

You know I always see the day
Crashing right before my eyes
But I have never known the truth
this pocket fall of lies

I wanna go home, I wanna be free
This exploitation is killing me
I wanna revolve , I wanna control
This tormenting fatality
This Forced March is killing me

The time is running
through my hands
Like sand - we are crawling in
I guess my end is near and the
rope of my life is getting thin.
