Overwhelming waiting
looking at the door
rattle of the key
steps on the floor

I've ridden for a fall
tomorrow I will die
the hangman calls my name
from the other side

I won't keep you waiting mephisto
tomorrow is my time and I will go with you

deadly overstatement
I'll make a mortal day
capital punishment
smelling the grave
but I don't rue my life now
feeling the rage
that I entomb in my mind
there is not grace
you know this is my big time
feeling the breathe
my last breath man,

what's going on
what can I deplore
thrown into the shadow
I will fear no more
