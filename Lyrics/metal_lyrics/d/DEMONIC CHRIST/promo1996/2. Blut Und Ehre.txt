You tuned your back - walked away
Leaving no regrets behind
Severing the family bloodline
Spilling the sacred trust I held
Torturing your image still taunts
Deceiving you never believed in me
Blinded by your disloyalty
Enemy this pain cannot be undone

Releasing myself
Vulnerable to the games that you play
I will not submit to your power
Strengthening regain respect and pride
Honouring the power within
Letting go of the destruction you caused
I donât need you and your selfish ways
Youâve fallen way behind
I was always loyal and true to you
My brother my blood my love
And you betrayed me with your lies
The blood was spilled when you stabbed me in the back
Deceiver I will never forgive you
The bloodline was severed with no remorse no contrition
I cannot believe your dishonour
Is this the payment I deserve for giving you all of me
Eternity infinity in torment
Now it is done
Blood and honour - Blut und ehre
I would have died for you
I would have killed for you
Cut my own throat for you
And it was a game to you
Blut und ehre - Blood and Honour
Walking through illusion not knowing
Feeling pain no control
What once was true proven false
Treachery illusion - all is lost
Emotions overwhelmed continue to torment me
Suicidal visionary passing through the gateway
Back to mortality rebirth a new start
Circle of flesh will I ever learn
This is not a chosen path
Struggling with destiny
Where it ends it must begin
Magickal realms of fate

You turned your back walked away
Leaving no regrets behind
Severing the family bloodline
Spilling the sacred trust I held
Torturing your image still taunts
Deceiving you never believed in me
Blinded by your disloyalty
Enemy this pain cannot be undone

You will pay the cosmos for the pain you caused
