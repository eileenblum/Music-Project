We have risen from frozen tombs
Feeling cold winds
And Octoberâs frost
Summoned forth from ancient slumber
We heed Tiamatâs call
Elohim falls tonight
Kur will take him
Armies of the dead
Destroy descending angels Now dawns the next millennium
Tiamat reigns again
The virgin mother suffers
And jesus weeps tears of blood
