Hear the call of Jehovah priests
Greet his divine descention
Jesus of nazareth comes this night
From the realm of the holy
Gather for his arrival
All await his command
Hundreds of his servants
Await their judgment
All but one
King of jews
Fucking false prophet
I renounce jesus christ
Enter the holy shrine
A mass of fools before me
Unsuspecting of their kind
My blade finds itâs mark
Time and time again
Until no holy man still stands
Pazuzu I adore your dark possession
The rivers of blood stain my cloth
All priests have fallen
And I await you - christ!
