Always dreaming never sleeping no reverence for god
I walk the earth a mortal man this land sempiternal
If you could see through my eyes torment suffering
Unimaginable to your mind
Sinful thoughts of lust and sodomy
Embrace my mind as I awaken
To a new world, the old one left behind
I realize I'm the chosen one
I am the one you will fear the most
I am the one who now owns your soul
Lost in a nightmare
I will appear and seek my vengeance
You will never rest again
Enter unto my dream realm
Feel my evil wrath as I take your life
Watch as you bleed writhe in pain for me
Weak - you followed me couldn't live for yourself
Suffer - on the cross watching you die for me
Ruler of a world I created in my mind
Images of a distant past I dreamt for many years
Feeling the power strength within my mind
I begin my slaughter on the frail ones
You cannot hide I laugh as you weep
You chose to oppose me now I seek my vengeance
On your soul receiving the pain
I feel no more I'm master
Now you are mine forever and ever
I am your master - you are my slave
I never wanted to be a god
In a world full of sheep and puppets
That would answer my command
I only want to be free to please myself
You will never see what I've seen
You're much too weak
