The time has come for unholy indulgence
The wrath of Satan is near
Battle will soon begin
Demons of hate are summoned from the land of Kur
Warriors from beyond the gate come forth
In all his glory Cthulhu rises from the shadowed depths below
Evil saints awaken from the shadowed depths below
With blackened hate in their eyes
My blade gleams in the dark
Concealed within my alb
Master Therion will take me
And Christ shall fall
The holy prepare for their doom
Mockery of the father
Sodomy of the son
Blasphemy of the holy spirit
Desecrate the holy church
His teachings have been futile I serve the dog no more
His book of false prophecies are anointed with fire
