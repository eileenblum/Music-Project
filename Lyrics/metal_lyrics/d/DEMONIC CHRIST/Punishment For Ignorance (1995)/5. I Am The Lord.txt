Tormented and deceived
Emptiness surrounds me
Darkness engulfs my soul
I find shelter in your wings
And safety within your wrath
Excruciating pain within
My soul is ripped from my body
Blood drains from my wounds
Your attack so delightful
A challenge of the flesh
I unleash my chaotic fury
Battle of the gods
I am lord - I am lord
The shadow of my horns
Threatens your existence
A mirrored image of strength
Belial, we are as one
Spread your wings
Show me the way to the netherworld
