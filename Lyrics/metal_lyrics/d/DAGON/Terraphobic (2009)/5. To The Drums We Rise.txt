I remember the blasphemy
As They took us to slavery
Where is your god to save you now
Now fall on your knees and bow

I remember the Dowed remains
Where They burned my fathers remains
I remember the stench of death
As I drew my last gray breath

For slaves forevermore
No one will hear our cries
Sink to the ships of war
To the beat of the drum we rise

Three years have come and gone
Since last I saw my own
Now my back is broken and bent
And my life is nearly spent

We are proof of mankind's disgrace
Hold of the warrior race
Never shall we be free
Caught in the vast machine

For slaves forevermore
No one will hear our cries
Take to the ships of war
Our cannons with burning eyes

For slaves forevermore
Our humanity suffers enough
Sink to the ships of war
To the beat of the drums we rise

And they cry! 
Row! Row!
Carry us to the attack
Row! Row!
Take us acrossed and back
Row! Row!
Carry us onto the kill
Row! Row!

To the beat of the drums
To the beat of the drums
To the beat of the drums
To the beat of the drums we rise
