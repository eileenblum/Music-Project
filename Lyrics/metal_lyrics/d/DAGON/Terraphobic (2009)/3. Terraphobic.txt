I shan't forget the moment
That changed my life forever more
The day I found her lying
Aqueous upon the shore

Hair of bright vermilion
Skin of pallid white
Ensanguined holes within her face
No eyes to grant her sight

A child ocean born
A daughter of the sea
Now of her home forlorn
Abhors the Earth beneath her feet
A child ocean born
A daughter of the sea
Now of her home forlorn
Abhors the Earth beneath her feet

A decade's past and still I
See her in my dreams so haunting
Her tortured cries of pain 
Fill my ears as if in taunting

The Terraphobic
Abhorrent accident of creation
Cast from the Sea
In agony without cessation

I thought her dead until
Her body shook with mortal fear
A ragged breath was drawn
Her face was stained with blood and tears

As I stood gazing
At this huddled mass upon the sand
I cried in terror for
She'd been struck visionless by her own hand

A child ocean born
A daughter of the sea
Now of her home forlorn
Abhors the Earth beneath her feet
A child ocean born
A daughter of the sea
Now of her home forlorn
Abhors the Earth beneath her feet

A decade's past and still I
See her in my dreams so haunting
Her tortured cries of pain 
Fill my ears as if in taunting

The Terraphobic
Abhorrent accident of creation
Cast from the Sea
In agony without cessation

Locked in this tenebrous cell
Her home in lieu of the ocean
A face so blank and cold
A hollow voice with no emotion

We called her mad for she
Despised the world that we so cherish
Yet for no more than spite
The denizens of land shall assign themselves to perish

A decade's past and still I
See her in my dreams so haunting
Her tortured cries of pain 
Fill my ears as if in taunting

The Terraphobic
Abhorrent accident of creation
Cast from the Sea
In agony without cessation

A decade's past and still I
See her in my dreams so haunting
Her tortured cries of pain 
Fill my ears as if in taunting

The Terraphobic
Abhorrent accident of creation
Cast from the Sea
In agony without cessation
