Battle 
Speed, the Captain calls
The enemy's in sight
On your oars, every man
The drum is beating faster, faster

Through the waves, this vessel glides
Propelled by blood and tears
Bones will shatter, muscles tear
We must obey our master, master

Row! Row! The war machine fueled
By the blood of it's slaves
Onward through the endless crashing waves
Row! Row! The war machine fueled
By the blood of it's slaves
Onward 'till the Captain sends us to our graves

Full speed ahead
Through countless miles of Ocean we have bled
Full speed ahead
We'll push this mighty ship 
until the day we are dead

Attack speed, the Captain calls...
The enemy draws near
Whip meets flesh as spirits break
The drum is beating faster, faster

Pull the oars, with all your might
Thirsty swords await us
Slaves and plunder, all the same
Possessed by others ever, after

Row! Row! The war machine fueled
By the blood of it's slaves
Onward through the endless crashing waves
Row! Row! The war machine fueled
By the blood of it's slaves
Onward 'till the Captain sends us to our graves

Full speed ahead
Through countless miles of Ocean we have bled
Full speed ahead
We'll push this mighty ship 
until the day we are dead

Stripes on our backs
The sign of the lash
A cruelty that can't be forgot
Memories remain
Of the ones that were slain
Long after our corpses all rot

Ramming speed, the Captain calls
The enemy must die
Every single enemy will die before the day is done
The drum is beating faster, faster

Kill them all! Kill them all!
The Captain screams in rage
The hull gives in, the sea bursts forth
This ship is headed for disaster

Row! Row! The war machine fueled
By the blood of it's slaves
Onward through the endless crashing waves
Row! Row! The war machine fueled
By the blood of it's slaves
Onward

Full speed ahead
Through countless miles of Ocean we have bled
Full speed ahead
We'll push this mighty ship 
Until the day we are dead

Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
