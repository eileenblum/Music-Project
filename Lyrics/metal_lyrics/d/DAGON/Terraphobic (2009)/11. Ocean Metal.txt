Pandemonium
The masses flood the shore
From the sea is heard
A massive metal roar

People wait and see
The galleon come in sight
Her mast reaches to the clouds
Her sails as black as night

Anticipation grows as the vessel
Pulls into the port
&gt;From the hold of the ship a cacophony grows
Of the heavy metal sort

We've come to reclaim what is rightfully ours
Said the Captain to his crew
This metal shall return to the hands 
Of the Chosen few

This is the final hour
For all the infidels 
Who seek to abuse this metallic power
This is their retribution
These warriors of the sea 
Will rid the world of this pollution

Ocean Metal
The warriors are coming
Ocean Metal
We'll take your breath away
Ocean Metal
You're drowning in the
Ocean Metal
You'd better beware

Ocean Metal
The warriors are coming
Ocean Metal
We'll take your breath away
Ocean Metal
You're drowning in the
Ocean Metal

One by one
The warriors gather for attack
Sabers raised up high
There is no turning back

Heretics will pay
Upon the Captain's mark
We'll tear into their flesh
And feed them to the sharks

Death to this lie is the battle cry
Of these ghostly tortured souls
Slitting the throats of the heretics
False metal's deadly toll

The Captain surveys all the carnage he's caused
With an awful kind of glee
We'll take this Metal back to our ship
And return it to the sea

This is the final hour
For all the infidels 
Who seek to abuse this metallic power
This is their retribution
These warriors of the sea 
Will rid the world of this pollution

Ocean Metal
The warriors are coming
Ocean Metal
We'll take your breath away
Ocean Metal
You're drowning in the
Ocean Metal
You'd better beware

Ocean Metal
The warriors are coming
Ocean Metal
We'll take your breath away
Ocean Metal
You're drowning in the
Ocean Metal

Rise! Rise! 
Warriors of Metal take up your arms
Fight! Fight!
The infidels

Rise! Rise! 
Warriors of Metal take up your arms
Fight! Fight!
The infidels

Ocean Metal
The warriors are coming
Ocean Metal
We'll take your breath away
Ocean Metal
You're drowning in the
Ocean Metal
You'd better beware

Ocean Metal
The warriors are coming
Ocean Metal
We'll take your breath away
Ocean Metal
You're drowning in the
Ocean Metal
