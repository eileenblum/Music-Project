From the wharf that night I saw it crawl onto the stony shore
And from a crevice in the rocks it pulled a hat and coat
And in the guise of man it shambled down the boardwalk in the dark
Primeval rumblings in its throat

The last
The last
The last
The last

Its luminescent eyes peer in the tavern by the docks
Where sailors spend their leave and dance with village girls
And when the dancers kiss it pounds its fists in angst against the glass
The lonely last of a long forgotten world

The last â not quite man, it lives within the sea
The last â final son of some aquatic breed
The last â we'll never understand its wretched pain
The last â the life we share the ecstasy it craves

Its scales â abhorrent worst of all creation
Its cries â a tortured mind's emancipation
Its form â inverse of common decency
Truest terror of it all â anthropomorphic similarities

Its people died out long ago, a holocaust we'll never know
Target of extinction, nature's own malediction
Lusting for our human pleasures, twisted longings beyond measure
Memories exhuming, painful past consuming

[Solo]

The last â not quite man, it lives within the sea
The last â final son of some aquatic breed
The last â we'll never understand its wretched pain
The last â the life we share the ecstasy it craves

[Solo]
