The sea is gone
Throw my shadow toward the surface
The icy wind draws upon us to the moon
Theres not one man
Without force onto the surface
So to the north this old legend goes on

The captain pushes onward
Deep into this frozen hell
We must keep fighting for our lives
And shouting on and we shall sail

Into the north we will sail, 
We will sail to the end of the world
To conquer the unknown
Into the north we will sail, 
We will sail to the end of our days

This passing night 
Takes another from our numbers
Row viciously night is upon now each of our own
And still we sail
The force of terror ship asunder
The captains mad but still along he makes us row

The captain pushes onward
Deep into this frozen hell
We must keep fighting for our lives
And searching if we shall fail

Into the north we will sail, 
Where we'll sail to the end of the world
And conquer the unknown
Into the north we will sail, 
Where we'll sail to the end of our days

The captains struggle
Where victory lies 
Upon us, how will this do
He brings message for this frozen ship
Theres nothing special in this frozen hell

And then his body sinking
Deep into this frozen hell
To late to for us to forfeit
To reach our final hell

Into the north we will sail, 
We will sail to the end of the world
To conquer the unknown
Into the north we will sail, 
We will sail to the end of our days

Into the north we will sail, 
We will sail to the end of the world
To conquer the unknown
Into the north we will sail, 
We will sail to the end of our days

Into the north!!
