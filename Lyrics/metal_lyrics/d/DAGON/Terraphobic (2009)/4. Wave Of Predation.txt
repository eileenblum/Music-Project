May I tell you of my passion of the dead
Erotic only in it's subtext
Experimental fantasy, realized just recently
Gourmets, but only of a subset

Beware ya pauper
Likewise ye men of power
We hunters roam the sea
Seeking whom we may devour
Beware ya pauper
Likewise ye men of power
We hunters roam the sea
Seeking whom we may devour

We drifted on
Till starvation struck and decency was gone
And now we have changed
We gleefully embrace a life deranged

The finest wines, like vinegar, fall bitter from my lips
Like soot and ash, the choicest roasted game
The taste I crave, a scarlet flow in transit to the crypts
Each meal I savor had a name

Beware ya pauper
Likewise ye men of power
We hunters roam the sea
Seeking whom we may devour
Beware ya pauper
Likewise ye men of power
We hunters roam the sea
Seeking whom we may devour 

We drifted on
Till starvation struck and decency was gone
And now we have changed
We gleefully embrace a life deranged

We butcher the flesh of the living
To consume the flesh of the dead

Our legend grows as empty vessels drifts into the ports
No sign of crew save the blood stains on the deck
All men shall quake at the mention of our names
A plague in every tongue dialect

We drifted on
Till starvation struck and decency was gone
And now we have changed
We gleefully embrace a life deranged

When winds do blow
Cold enough to chill your very soul
And when the tempest wails
Keep one eye on the sea for scarlet sails
