Fathom by fathom we make our descent 
Deeper than any tongue can tell 
Deeper than mortal man was meant
Where the sea doth boil from the fires of hell 
There we see the coral gates 
Climbing from the ocean floor
And behind an army conceived in hate 
Laden with the tools of war 

Legions of Atlantis 
Warriors of the sea 
Children of Poseidon 
Bathed in red fatality 
Legions of Atlantis 
Warriors of the sea 
Children of Poseidon 
Spread his wrath to humanity 

Armor carved from Nautilus
Urchin spikes are trident tines 
The generalâs steed a mighty squid 
Their standard is borne on a sailorâs spine 
The creatures of the sea are one 
An onslaught from Poseidonâs hand
Slaying all sparing none 
Revenge they seek on earthbound man 

Perverse mutated hybrids 
Bred within our walls 
Lighting of electric eel 
Strength of megaladonâs jaws 
Cunning of the orca 
Stinger of the ray 
Weapons of Poseidon 
Closing in on their prey
