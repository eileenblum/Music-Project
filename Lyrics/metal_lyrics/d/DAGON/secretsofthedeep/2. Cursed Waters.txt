Broken glass and champagne trickle down the side mingling with malignant tide
Like shells upon the shores our fates have been cast
This vessel's maiden voyage will surely be it's last
Broken bodies cast into the waves ocean depths have now become their graves
You cannot move you cannot cry the salty depths call you to die
The only release is in drowning nowhere to run once you're inside
You're at the mercy of the tide the only solace is in dying
Death and mutiny the consequential cost for once inside you are forever lost
In the misty darkness they are prisoners of the gloom stricken with the knowledge of inevitable doom
Struggling in shark infested waters begging for mercy from this fate. Dying
