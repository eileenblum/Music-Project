Knife to throat I scream gagged and bound One faithful face not to be found
Screams for help a pitiful sound so-called captain of oppression
Slain by power of suggestion Butcher now in resurrection
Waiting I watch from my grave in the sea
I seek my vengeance and only blood will pacify me.

The night invites and justifies my retribution alibi
Seek those who I will zombify Bloodshed now has come full cycle
Flesh I have, I have recycled justice done, judgement is final
I can't believe this, what am I doing here?
Cry out to God, deliver from my murderer's blade
