Statue of salt
I am alike

Departed meat
Is what I am

Seven suns shining
Burning reality
Into my skin

Seven suns shining
Igniting the Gospel
Vested in me (all)

Suffocation is
What I breathe

And starvation is
My number one dish

But I wish for nothing
Else than renaissance

My hands construct
Prisons of freedom

My tongue votes for
Upright lies told convincingly

And I think of nothing
Else than liberty

At last
Iâm the realizer
Youâre the tranquilizer
Until the end
