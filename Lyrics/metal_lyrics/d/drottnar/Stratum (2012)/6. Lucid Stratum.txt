Finally
A lucid stratum

Now eyesâ logic
Prospects

Fail to see
All common intuit

We now witness
Everything

And we have generated
Nothing

Become conscious

Lives are worth nix
To a certain someone
And all to the One

Machines are worth
Everything
To the common wealth
Of this coming empire

Souls assemble soon

Scream in our ears
Jesus
