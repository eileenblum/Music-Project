Wolves now â¢ Equals lambs
Dissections now â¢ Equals union
To differ â¢ Equals viciousness
Generosity now â¢ Equals greed

All is the same
As concepts overlap

Conformed attitudes
Claimed as â¢ Fractionized views

Sustaining
The individualistic
Delusion

We have seen
The beaten, sacrificed Body
But we cheer legalism
With silent applause

Show mercy with us
Father
Because we do not know
What we do or donât

Wolves now â¢ Equals lambs
Dissections now â¢ Equals union
To differ â¢ Equals viciousness

We are the same
The concepts overlap

Lionize me â¢ The common rarity
With no opposing
Opinions

Neglect equals respect
In interfacing relations

Lionize me â¢ The just liar

I do what I comfort
In the moment

Lionize me â¢ With the draped self
I am everyone else
