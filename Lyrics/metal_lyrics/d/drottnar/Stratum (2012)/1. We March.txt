We march
To the ringing of the bombs
We don a crown of bullets

Observe pain
Forget, go on

We love lies
Theyâre easier
To deal with

We march
To the ringing of the bombs
We don a crown of bullets

Ignore, destruct
Dream always

We prefer lies
They please

Watch, imagine
Touch the surface

We march
To the jingle of the dead
Acquaint with war
We mock
We fall
