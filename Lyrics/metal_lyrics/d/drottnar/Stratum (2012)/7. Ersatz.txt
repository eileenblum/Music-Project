Industrious and idle
We must produce

Until we leave
Our sloth suit

Thorough and careless
We must create

So that our
Apathy will be just

Ersatz
Solemn awe
For what we are

Intelligent and blessed
With ignorance

Keeping futility intact
With honest intentions

We are eloquent
Without tongues

Upright and vicious
We are clever
Without sense

Ersatz
Solemn awe
For what will come
