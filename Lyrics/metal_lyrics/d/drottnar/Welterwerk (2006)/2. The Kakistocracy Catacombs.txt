THE DEATH CONCEPT

Smack your own pride / Treat it with disgust
When looking in the eyes / Of our borrowed time

Strip down to the basics
Of your own soul / And think

LIFE IN ESSENCE

Sense a limit / To what's accepted
Char the barriers / To certainty

Search beneath ideas
Indoctrinated as logic in common
There will be answers / And you'll find

Turn your egos the fist
And the enemy your other cheek
Cease entertaining
Them

Cause that's what they want
Cause they're not unique
In their false individualism

But you're canvas / And so are they
Triumph Standardization

No one is a redeemer / But the one who is
Pity attempts for / Self-salvation

As we're intended / Acronyms for Messiah
In pattern, in union

A prime loom / Of life in essence

WE ALL SCHLEP

This is just a glimpse before our eyes
Watch how the ants are working
Come Armageddon!
