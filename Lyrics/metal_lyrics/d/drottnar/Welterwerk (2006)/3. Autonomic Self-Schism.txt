Trumpet ricochets are still audible

I. The bitter sound of a concluding sunset
II. The raging triumph of a glorious birth

The unison parade
A display for the globe
An exhibition for the mob

I. Conquered and asphysiated
In bedlam and madness
As witnessing their corpses

II. Liberation upon them
With their written names
They watch from the skies

I. Now being flayed by the thought of perdition
II. Now being saved by the tongue confessing

I. The bitter sound of a concluding sunset
Opinions construe the occurrence
Interpreting the prophetic act
Into science

II. The raging triumph of a glorious birth
A consciously chosen self-schism confirmed

To an enduring point of soul

The unison parade
A display for the globe
An exhibit for the mob
