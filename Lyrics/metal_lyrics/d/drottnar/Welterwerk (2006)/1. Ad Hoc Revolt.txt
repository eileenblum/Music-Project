I'm a regent of the off beam
The curser of sagacity
And products of my deeds
Show the flipside of my needs

I track a slip through
Flashing reminiscences
Within my dimming mindset

Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erratic

Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erection
(Descend)

Let my preferences be with you
Rather than with what infects me
What destroy everything in mankind

Pierce me with your incessant love
Let me once again see the waste
In my sporadic choices
Let me again feel the rapture
In serving you, my Father

My rapture
Your grandeur

Filth is my spawn
Destroying the connection
With you, whom I crave

Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erratic

Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erection
(Ascend)

In your glory
I'm ecstatic
