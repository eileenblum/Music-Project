Razor sharp realities
Cutting edge thrash
The harsh process of
Converging a mind's omega
A shot of "sense" now and then
Doesn't ease, nor release

All riven inside / And I'm my own
Destruction's czar

Unify me, us
In unison internally

Craving for your riveting appearance
In the mess of gods
My eyes are dazzled
From every hold

All riven inside

Deah knell / An event in progress

The sound of triumph
Is over the hills
But I refuse to 
Lower my flag
Even though I may
Pulled the trigger myself
Angels will sing me a hymn

Debunk the tongue
Within my head
Remove the cancer 
On my optic nerve

And I'm my own...

Razing soul authorities
Cutting edge mind rape
A killing narcosis society
Where we can't spot
The nebula
Even when staring
At the open sky
