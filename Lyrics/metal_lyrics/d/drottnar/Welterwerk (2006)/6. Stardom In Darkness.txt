Pervading our whole
Translating reality
Through which the essence
Of life is realized

Giving sense to this
Intermediate stage
Inextricably connected
To the next

Stardom in darkness
A glory on our heads

Clearing the view
In this crescendo
Leading us to
The inner sanctum
A new meaning of sanity

Where we can understand
His philanthropy
And why this should be ours

Where love is real
And not an element
Of a sine qua non

Where heaven and 
The divine idiom is ours
And we're not smothered
By anything

Stardom in darkness
A glory on our heads
