Listen blackened souls 
Failures, blasphemers of Christ 
Your time, in this age of chaos, 
Will come, the day of wrath... 

Your theory, the rise of hell 
Will never come, the time will show 
Evil symbols are dying 
In the light of Christ 

Failures, blasphemers of Christ 
Surrender to Him 
receive eternal life 

The time of antichrist is coming 
This is the end of the age 

In this coming age 
The pain will be big 
For unbelievers 
So there's one thing to be said: 
Receive the words of truth! 

Seek the Lord 
Remain with Him 
Eternal life 

The antichrist is helpless 
Fighting for its life 
Loosing power 
As we plunder hell 

The day of victory will come... 

Wrath, pain and death 
Becomes the doom of antichrist
