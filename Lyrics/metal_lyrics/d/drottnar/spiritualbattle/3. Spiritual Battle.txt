A battle within the spiritual 
Ravages around me 
Demons trying to ruin me 
And my soul 

But my soul lies in Jesus' hands 
Because I let Him in 
He fills me with His Holy Spirit 
And suits me with His armor 

When darkness and sorrow 
Enter my mind 
Evil thoughts torment 
And exhaust my inner 

Jesus, He comes 
To wipe away my tears 
And give of His eternal grace 
To expel all evil 
And replace it with new hope 
And give me what I need 

You too must receive Jesus 
As Lord in your life 
So you won't be torn into pieces 
Without anyone helping you
