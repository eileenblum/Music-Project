Old times of pagan customs 
Times of darkness 
Belong now to the past 
Times have come 
Where idols can't stand 
Within the once dark land 
A white realm arises 

Crusaders for the Mighty 
Enter the land with storm 
Now upon the proud mountains 
A holy throne is built 

The time has come 
For Christ to hold sway 
Because the evil empire is defeated 
Now the good hordes 
Invade the scenery 
That belongs to The Mighty One 

Throughout the land 
Christ's love is spread 
To build this- a holy realm 
Never will this white realm fall 
Like the evil did... 

Proudly I raise my voice to praise 
The Almighty who won the fight 
Who shed His blood...
