A breeze from the nocturnal forest 
Howls in the northern sky 
The moon is hidden by clouds 
Dawn may not come... 

The breeze is icy and makes me freeze 
Darkness surrounds me 
Everything is dying 
There is no light 

I hear shrieks from the masses 
Whose hearts are black 
Lost in the northern cold 
Helpless without hope 

I'm not afraid 
My heart is clean 
I'm living by my faith in Christ 
Sanctified by His blood 

As I look around myself 
I see ruins of the holocaust 
All life soaked into lifeless dust 

Suddenly, as from nowhere 
The Master comes 
To bring His people home 
To fulfill the prophesies 
And the promise 

The day is past I'm going to the everlife 
Away from the destruction 
To eternity!
