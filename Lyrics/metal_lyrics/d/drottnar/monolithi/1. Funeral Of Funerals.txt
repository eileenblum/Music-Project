I will watch without eyes
The summoning

I will hear without ears
The cheers (the cheers)

I will scream without tongue
In ecstasy

I will cry without tears
In uttermost joy

I will raise my body
Without bones

I will cross land impossible
To traverse

I will march without feet
In the grand finale

Rejoice, my friend
This is the end
It is the funeral of funerals

Rejoice, my friend
This is the end
It is the funeral of funerals

I will lift mountains
With my bare hands

And I will see all time
From creation to extinction

I will watch my world
Erupt
In sulfur

While your eyes blinked

Rejoice, my friend
This is the end
It is the funeral of funerals

Rejoice, my friend
This is the end
It is the funeral... of funerals
