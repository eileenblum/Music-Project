Vicious and victorious
I shut my eyes
I shut your eyes
Lucid and superior
So saturated
I crave for escape

Shivering but revolting
I build citadels
Stone by stone
Vain calls my name
As I watch dawn
Come irrevocably

A manifest
A manifest of madness
A notice
Of neurosis

A manifest
A manifest of madness
A notice
Of neurosis

Possessed
High tech

Oppressed
Cutting edge

Possessed
Living wreck

Oppressed
On a ledge

Anticipation and anxiety
This is sanity
This is real
My eyes unshut

At last I realize
At last
This was my luck

A manifest
A manifest of madness
A notice
Of neurosis

A manifest
A manifest of madness
A notice
Of neurosis
