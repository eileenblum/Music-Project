Dead
Dead silence
At the mental tundra

Nothing
There is nothing
In the lucid skies

Subterranean sun
Enclosed in flames

Subterranean sun
A heart ablaze

Subterranean sun
Enclosed in flames

Subterranean sun
A heart ablaze

I listen
But everything is quiet
I feel nothing
But nothingness

I scream
But yet I am silent
I see nothing
But my own reflection

Nothing breeds nothing
Fundamental ruse
Finds no terrain

In quintessence of void
I grasp for the few
Crumbs of substance

Subterranean sun
Enclosed in flames

Subterranean sun
A heart ablaze

I crave to rise victorious
Again and again and again

I wander into the desert
To see the starlit skies
I crave to rise
