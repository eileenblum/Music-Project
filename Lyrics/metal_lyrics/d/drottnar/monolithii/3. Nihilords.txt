The dreadful
Monoliths
Who are carved out
From stone
They cast
Dark shadows
From a thousand suns

The path is narrow
And darkness blinds
I ask myself,
"Will anyone find peace?"

Lead us, meet us
In flux through a world of death
Through nihilords

Before resignation
Takes us
Lost by time
And age
We dream to see
The wealth
Beyond this world

Lead us, meet us
In flux through a world of death
Through nihilords

The reveries
Of old men
And crippled
Flesh and soul
Yet veins run
With fuels
Awaiting ignition

Lead us, meet us
In flux through a world of death
Through nihilords
