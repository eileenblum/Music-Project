The glare, the vibrancy, the energy
Of the muted screams
And silent genocide
Of us all

Apocalypse
Set us free
(From ourselves)
Apocalypse

Apocalypse
Set us free
From havoc

The gloom, the apathy, the monotony
Of lives and dreams of life
That ends by the downfall
Of your neighbour

Apocalypse
Set us free
(From ourselves)
Apocalypse

Apocalypse
Set us free
From havoc

The crowds, the cheers, the philanthropy
Of misanthropic hearts
Where everything rots
Totally

Void shall be the legacy
It shall echo in eternity
The maze, the synergy, the unity
Of failed humanity

Apocalypse
Set us free
(From ourselves)
Apocalypse

Apocalypse
Set us free
From havoc

This is rendezvous
With none other than
Death
Death
