Pain, be my halo
Grief, tear my skin
Cancer, be my healing

Blood, be my water
Tears, end my joy
Nails, pierce my flesh
Death, come with me!

Axiom

Denial, be my manifest
Slander, be the truth
Punishment, come reward
To the adversity
Of my success

All for you
All for you
All for you
All for you

Death
Come with me!
Death
Come with me!
Death
Come with me!
Death
Come with me!
Death
Come with me!
