Cheating death
In ultimate bliss

Playing hell
With an upper hand

Eluding apocalypse
In any race

Outshining stars
In every sense

Crowning darkness
With thorns

Taking goats
By the horns

Reign, rebel, reign!

Do as you please
And we may rest in peace

Destroying destroyers
With joy

Spilling blood
At a trembling devil
Leaving grimness
To rot on a cross

Eluding apocalypse

Outshining stars
In every sense

Reign, rebel, reign!

Do as you please
We may rest in peace
