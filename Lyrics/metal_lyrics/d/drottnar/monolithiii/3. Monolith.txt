Conceptual
Monuments

Colossal
Fragilities

See this
Endless
Masterpiece

See this
With your blurred view

The last frontiers
Of mysteries unspoken

See the pearls
In darkness

Hear the
Words of peace

Feel (the) supreme
Certainty

Of a moment real
But still unreal

Come forward into the shadows
Until you see our creator

Exposed

Because you are
The crown jewel of creation

And you are in the midst
Of your own

Annihilation
