When nothing is left but innocent
Memories of the past
And when through years
Being cast into shades of loss
Sky was never so dull yore

Gazing the elemental skyline
All the city lights gone
I fell my whole being disappear
Lost into unnamed immensities

Thy face, so pale
And I do can only remember
The pain inflicted
While my will is cancelled
The silence is the deepest

The coldness when sorrow
Empty my soul
Love once left behind
Turning a state of permanent distress

Lost into unnamed immensities
Thy face, so paleâ¦
Itâs all I can remember
Love once left behind
Turning a state of permanent distress

The snow so purely niveous
Covers the bridge and came along
With deep frost towards astral
Silence I no longer feel myself
And it becomes a part of my
Inner silent oblivionâ¦
