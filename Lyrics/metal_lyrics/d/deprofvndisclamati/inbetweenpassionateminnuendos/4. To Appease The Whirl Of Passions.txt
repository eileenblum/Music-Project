Inâ¦ thy eyesâ¦ lies a willâ¦ that was so pure
Eloquent loveâ¦ which took Down into sparks of passion
And it kills me, it hath secluded me
My heart, sleeps tired before the
Vast uncovered way,
Moje serce jest zmeczone...
Inside, the crescent bossom of the denial of
Will...overflowing lakes
Jeziora jako wzrastajace zaprzeczenie...
Of grief with, a sigh of relief, painting the view
With a sentiment of pain and joy...
Jedno westchnienie Ã­ bÃ³l...
In thine breast I felt... how... intempestive
Was, my devotion life, disappears upon
The face of my hand, dentro...de minhas
LÃ¡grimas a dor... deflora...o meu
SilÃªncio...
...On the serene landscape, so dark
At the end I'm already, falling
In my doom lenitive in this, twilight
of metaphysical death
Where tales of love, lies bleeding
And now ,only remains, a black romance
My pain is so utterly deeper...
Now... it was dismistified forever...
O,... but I still,... believe
Mine heart,... is, only... ashes...
Ripped by the thorns of the plant I tilled
It has comprehension the ideia of
The shining that yore has filled thy
Heart as the dim of
the colours becames sedative for
A heart awashed by passion now
Seared, in disillusion,... oh mournful
Commiserated, crying before it's
Own denial, on a wistful, worldâ¦
Thyself's desire which inâ¦
Asceticismâ¦, begunâ¦ To
Flourish inâ¦
Stagnance completeâ¦
