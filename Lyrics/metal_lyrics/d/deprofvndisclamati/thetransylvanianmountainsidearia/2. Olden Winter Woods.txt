The frost poured down
upon vast opaque fields
it mourns the light's absence
and darkness... it devours my soul!

Frozen death, it smells through
the olden woods...
Frozen death, it smells through
the olden woods...
Niveous snow flakes paint
All the view, wandering thoughts
Niveous snow flakes paint
All the view, wandering thoughts

Fierce winds blasted the decaying leaves
Swept all dying hope, monstruous shades
Increase while the past whispers in despair

Frozen death, it smells through
the olden woods...
Frozen death, it smells through
the olden woods...
Niveous snow flakes paint
All the view, wandering thoughts
Niveous snow flakes paint

All the view, wandering thoughts

The languid light, it swirls away
My lost eyes immersed on other's disturbance...
