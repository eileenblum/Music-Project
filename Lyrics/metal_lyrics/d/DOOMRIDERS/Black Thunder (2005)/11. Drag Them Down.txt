Wandered through the wasteland
No skin on your feet
Early life abandoned
Spitting out your teeth

Take them with you

Come too far to turn back
Revenge will be sweet

They tore you down, kicked your ass
Dragged you through broken glass
But that was then, and this is now
When you meet again, drag them down with you
Never let them get away
Make 'em scream, make 'em pay
Another chance may never come
So finish here, make sure it's done

And when you go, drag them down with you
