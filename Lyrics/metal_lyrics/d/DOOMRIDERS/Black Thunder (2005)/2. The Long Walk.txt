We'll march on through this cold hellish night
The weak and the old dying of frostbite
Through piercing wind and icy snow
Keep pushing north to our prison home

Death march! Death march! Death march! Death march!

No walls, no fence keep us inside
Held captive by the snow and the ice
Surrender your hope, succumb to your fear
No one escapes, we will all die here

Death march! Death march! Death march! Death march!

Through mountains high, and valleys low
Through desert heat, and arctic snow
Six of us run with no chance to survive
Rather to die free, than a slave alive
