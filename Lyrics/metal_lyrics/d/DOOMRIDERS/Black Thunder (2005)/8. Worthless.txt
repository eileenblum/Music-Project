Born scarred, twisted and broken
Our mouths gagged before words are spoken
Spit into this life and thrown in this cage
They taught us our worth at a tender young age

After all that we've said
After all that we've done
After all that we fight for
They said that we were worthless

Punch in and punch out, give up and give out
Weary and broken, got no choice
Shackled and chained, to lives mundane
And die with nothing to show for it

After all that we've said
After all that we've done
After all that we fight for
They said that we were worthless
