I came up from below
When the she wolf howled
And the night gave birth
To her only child

Black thunder!

I never knew no mercy
I never knew no shame
I am hell in the storm clouds
The devil calls my name

Black thunder!

I'm the hellion wolf
Steal your baby's breath
Won't bow to no man
I'm the son of death

Black thunder!

I'll never show no mercy
I'll never show no shame
You better hear my warning
Don't never call my name
