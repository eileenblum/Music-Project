Under the raging sea, sirens call out to me
"Join her where she lies dead... sleep on the cold sea bed."

I'm coming home

Under the raging sea, sirens call out to me
"Come rest your weary bones... where her soul sleeps alone."

I'm coming home

Under the raging sea, sirens call out to me
"Your true love lies in wait... in the darkness."

I'm coming home

Under the raging sea, sirens call out to me
"Set sail into the night and never return."
