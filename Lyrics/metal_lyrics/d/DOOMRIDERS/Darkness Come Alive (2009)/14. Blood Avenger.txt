The truth asleep rests hidden deep
Beneath the sands the desert keeps
A thousand years beneath earth and stone
Hid from those which it would dethrone
Gods and men like snakes entwined
Yet the crooked cross began the lies
A gift from high hidden our sight
The lies like wool blind our eyes
Blood avengers the truth will set us free
Prophets false from creed be born
Defiling all to which you've sworn
Blood avengers the truth will set you free
