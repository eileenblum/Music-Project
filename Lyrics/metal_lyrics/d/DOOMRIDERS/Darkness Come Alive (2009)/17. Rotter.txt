Step right up, get in line
Your time is running out
Hurry up and meet the end
We're whoring the reaper out
Death disguised as glamour
All your desire is yours
We'll sell you your mortality
You'll jump in the fire willingly
Rotter eating your soul from the inside out
Rotter paying for premium death
You're falling apart and content
You're dying and we're getting rich
You're fucked up beyond all repair
We're laughing cause we sent you there
Death disguised as glamour
All your desire is yours
Buy a ticket to your grave
You jump in the fire willingly
Rotter eating your sol from the inside out
Rotter paying for premium death
