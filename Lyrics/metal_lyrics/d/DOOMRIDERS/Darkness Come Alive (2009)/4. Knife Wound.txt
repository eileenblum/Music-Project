Go one twist the knife
I know i never been right
I don't live how you'd like
Just keep your mouth shut
I don't care what you're trying to say
Fucked it up a hundred ways
My road is mine to walk
Go choke on all your talk
New wounds on old scars
They'll heal soon and I'll move on down the road...
Don't need what you've got to give
Don't care how you want me to live
Don't want what you're trying to sell
Take it with you to hell
Eat shit with a grin
Don't care if i lose or win
The road's long, I'll get to the end
I won't get dragged down no more
New wounds on old scars
They'll heal soon and I'll move on down the road...
New wounds on old scars
They'll heal soon next time I'll keep my guard
I don't want your money
I don't want your life
I need your charity
Like a wound from a knife
Come alive
