Mercy
Death growing inside me
Feel it coming on strong
Lift me up to god above
Oh lord where i belong
Death growing inside me
Feel it coming on strong
Take me down to hell below
Oh lord it won't be long
Mercy
Death growing inside me
Feel it coming on strong
Lift me up to god above
Oh lord where i belong
Death walks behind
You feel it coming on strong
Take me down to hell below
Oh lord it won't be long
Mercy
