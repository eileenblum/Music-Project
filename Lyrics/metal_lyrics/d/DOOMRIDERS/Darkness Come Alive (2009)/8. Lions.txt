Don't let these fuckers grind you down
Don't let these bastards kill your soul
Bottom feeders in the worst way
A bunch of fucking turncoats
You gave them more than they ever gave back
And now everyone knows
Don't let these fuckers grind you down
Don't let these leeches suck you dry
You've got the heart of a lion
You've got the strength to survive
Time is their true punishment
They'll eat each other alive
Don't let them grind you down
Choke on all their lies
Wasted all their lives
Lowest of the low
Cowards so beneath you now
You've got the heart of a lion
