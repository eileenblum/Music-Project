Heavy lies the crown upon the heads of kings heavy is the price we pay for petty things
Always feel their eyes burning through your back always take the blame for what they lack
Heavy lies the crown
Biting at your heels never let you rest live to twist the knife when you least expect
Heavy lies the crown upon your weary brow heavy is the toll always due right now
Pretenders beware strike you down when you stand
