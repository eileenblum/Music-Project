All you have â i gave you
All you are â i made you
All you've done â i pushed you
All you've ever won â you owe to me
All you've seen â i showed you
All you've heard â i told you
All you've learned â i taught you
All you want, you begged for on your knees
All your pain â you caused it
All your heart â you lost it
All your soul â you sold it
All your bridges burned beyond repair
All your words â you'll swallow
All your threats, so hollow
All your faith, untested
All your squandered life
You'll never learn
Jealous god
You'll never learn
