Fill our heads all full of lies
Bow to those we should despise
Taught a history not our own
Martyrs who we should dethrone
Heroes made from evil men
Made immortal by legend
Self righteous men with petty wars
Gladly turned their souls to whores
Fill our heads all full of lies
Bow to those we should despise
Taught a history not our own
Martyrs who we should dethrone
Sickened by this cowardice
Sickened by this lack of sense
Tell the truth
Let us bear witness
We never learn from our mistakes
