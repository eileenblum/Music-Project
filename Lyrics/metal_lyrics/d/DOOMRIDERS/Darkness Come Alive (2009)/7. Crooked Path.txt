A bastard heart
A wayward soul
Damned to walk alone
Godless Serpent
With no heart
Doomed forever roam

It matters not how hard I try
Cursed to live this crooked life
A slave to sin, a slave to wrath
Cursed to walk this crooked path

Winds of hell blow
Guide my way home
Never set me free

Light of heaven
Be my shelter
Please watch over me

It matters not how hard I try
Cursed to live this crooked life
A slave to sin, a slave to wrath
Cursed to walk this crooked path
