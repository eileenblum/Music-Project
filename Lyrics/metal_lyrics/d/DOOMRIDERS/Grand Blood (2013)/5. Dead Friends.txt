Mat was sick
For what seemed like years
But he never gave up hope
The last thing that he said to me
Was I'll see you soon

Henrik had a heart of gold
We never knew
Cuz he never told
I heard the news
And my heart went cold
But we all gotta go sometime

Dead friends
Dead friends
This ain't the way
It's supposed to end
Dead friends
Dead friends
Gimme time
For my heart to mend

Richie was the righteous kind
He fought for the working man
He never gave up
And he never backed down
Until the cancer did him in

Tim was a friend
And we lost touch
Those last few years
We hadn't spoken much
He did a speedball
His first and his last
I got the call the next day
That hell passed

Dead friends
Dead friends
This ain't the way
It's supposed to end
Dead friends
Dead friends
Gimme time
For my heart to mend

Dead friends
Dead friends
I don't need
No more dead friends
