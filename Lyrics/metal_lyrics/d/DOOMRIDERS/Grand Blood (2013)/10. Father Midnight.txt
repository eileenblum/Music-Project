Say my name
Burning questions
Inside my brain
Memories burn
A raging fire
Things I've done
Will not expire
Forgotten scars
Inside my head
I can't take back
All the things I've said
Mind is racing
I'm still awake
Can you see me tremble?
Can you see me shake?

Father midnight say my name
Father midnight say my name

I'll deal with his on my own
I'm weakest when I am alone
A crushing weight on my chest
Trade my anger for regret
