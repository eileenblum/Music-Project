Bad vibes
Everyone I see
Is lookin' down on me
Bad vibes
Everything I do
Ain't good enough for you
Bad vibes
Every choice I make
Is a big mistake
Bad vibes
Everyone I know
Is fuckin' dying slow

You gimmie gimmie
You gimmie gimmie
You gimmie gimmie
Bad vibes

Bad vibes
From the TV set
The fucking world's a mess
Bad vibes
From the preacher man
He tell me that I'm damned
Bad vibes
From my family
Advice I don't need
Bad vibes
It's all there is
Nobody gives a shit

You gimmie gimmie
You gimmie gimmie
You gimmie gimmie
Bad vibes

Bad vibes
Everyone I see
Is lookin' down on me
Bad vibes
Everything I do
Ain't good enough for you
Bad vibes
Every choice I made
Is a big mistake
Bad vibes
Everyone I know
Is fuckin' dying slow

You gimmie gimmie
You gimmie gimmie
You gimmie gimmie
Bad vibes

Fuck
