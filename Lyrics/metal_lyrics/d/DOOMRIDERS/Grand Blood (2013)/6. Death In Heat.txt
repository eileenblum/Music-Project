Waking from her sleep
her hunger now erupts
Rising to her feet
Filled with primal lust
Wide eyed in the night
Always on the move
Sweat drips down you back
As she seduces you

Death in heat
Closing in on you
Death in heat
Nothing you can do

She wolf on your trail
Hunt you night and day
If willing or if by force
You are still her prey
Hunger deep inside
That never subsides
Run your entire life
But you can never hide

Death in heat
Closing in on you
Death in heat
Nothing you can do

Run - run
Prey - prey

Death in heat
Closing in on you
Death in heat
Nothing you can do
