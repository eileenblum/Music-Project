We live in the shallows
We don't want their fame
We hide from their sight
We don't play their games

We live in the shadows
But we carry on
We live in the shadows
But we carry on

They don't know our hunger
They don't know our hearts
Throw us to the lions
If it lowers all their costs

We live in the shadows
But we carry on
We live in the shadows
But we carry on

Without their acceptance
We will carry on
Despite the deceivers

We will carry on
The heat of the fire
It's all that we know
The heat of the fire
It's all that we know
