Let this serve
As a reminder
Money is this world's
Only god
And we're all praying
At the altar
Bowing our heads
As we're robbed

God is greed
Fall to your knees
And kneel at the feet
Of the new pyramids

Kings staring down
From high rises
The lash whips down
Upon our backs
Build their temples
Of excess
Unaware of the bridles
On our necks

God is greed
Fall to your knees
And kneel at the feet
Of the new pyramids
