It's with a heavy heart I ask:
Soon may all this
Heartache pass?
May this uncertainty
Soon end?
Show me light
Around the bend

There's a strange blood flowing
Flowing through my veins
Grand blood
Bad blood

It's with a sinking soul I cry
Give me purpose
Or let me die
Promise me
I did not waste this life
That I chose virtue
Over vice

There's a strange blood flowing
Flowing through my veins
Grand blood
Bad blood

And it stays my hand
From doing good
It stifles all my loving words
It numbs my conscience
When it burns
Won't let me be
The man I should
Won't let me walk
It makes me crawl
Won't let me stand up when I fall

There's a strange blood flowing
Flowing through my veins
Grand blood
Bad blood
