The phone was a warning
Ringing early in the morning
My father's voice on the line
Said "It was just her time"

Knock the wind out of my chest
Lie awake in my bed
Didn't know what to say
It was Christmas day

Oh - it hurt like hell, so unexpected
Oh - it hurt like hell, so unexpected

Had a few too many
Driving home in a hurry
You didn't see the brake lights
When you swerved to the side

Can you tell me do you see her
When you look in the mirror?
Can you tell me does she haunt you
In everything that you do?

Oh - you've gone to hell
And you can't come back now
Oh - you've gone to hell
And you can't come back now
