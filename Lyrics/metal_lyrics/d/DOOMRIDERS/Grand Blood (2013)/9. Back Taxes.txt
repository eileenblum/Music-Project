You better pay up
Because our minds are made up

You better make it right
Because our grip is tight

You better pay your debt
The man don't never forget

You better pay your tax
We're funding drone attacks

I'll sing it true, back tax blues
I'll sing it true, back tax blues

Don't wanna hear no excuses
Because everyone loses

Don't wanna hear no plea
Nobody rides for free

Don't wanna hear no denial
Cuz we can sniff out a liar

Don't get no more deductions
Now you're truly fucked son

I'll sing it true, back tax blues
I'll sing it true, back tax blues
