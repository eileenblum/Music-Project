give me a reason
give me a chance
to turn my thoughts into words
I have so much to say
but my mind has gone astray
I have no idea [2x]

how to form my lips
how to move my tongue [2x]

should I leave this world with this bitterness
should I leave this place with this emptiness
or should I stay right here and carry on the same
with these unspoken thoughts and this endless shame
I don't know how to pass these days
when will I get out of this fucking maze
give me a reason
give me a chance
to turn my thoughts into words
I have so much to say
but my mind has gone astray
I have no idea [2x]

how to form my lips
how to move my tongue [2x]

can you lead my way to an open door
my mind has been betrayed by a nameless whore
a riddle for the world
how to speak right from the heart
give me a reason
give me a chance
to get my completion
before it ends
