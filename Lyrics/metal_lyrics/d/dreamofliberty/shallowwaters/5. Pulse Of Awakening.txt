welcome to our own dystopia
where the blood of our leaders runs green and black
trading eye for and eye and greed for grief
the souls of the masses as currency [2x]

do you feel the pulse of awakening
beating the rhythm to our demise
pounding a call to defy this fate
prove that this world is meant to be saved
do you feel the pulse of awakening

this is the planet of the lost
it seems each man has his price
dancing to the tune of their selfish lives [2x]
all the money in the world
won't save them from the reaper's scythe

do you feel the pulse of awakening
beating the rhythm to our demise
pounding a call to defy this fate
prove that this world is meant to be saved
do you feel the pulse of awakening

this is the planet of the blind
empty faces with shallow minds
tear off your masks
and stand upright
this may be our last chance to rise and fight
