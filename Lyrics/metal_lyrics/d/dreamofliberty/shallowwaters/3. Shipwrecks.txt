sometimes I feel like sinking down
and forgetting all my sorrows
feel the cold water on my skin
but then I remember that it's hard to breathe without air

sometimes I wanna come home
wanna lay down in my bed
I wanna feel like being at the right place (I'm always sinking)
but then I remember that it's hard to come home
without anything I could call my own (I'm always sinking)

anything I could call my own

sometimes I want to jump and to fly around the world
and go to places I've never been
but then I remember that it's hard to fly without wings

sometimes I wanna come home
wanna lay down in my bed
I wanna feel like being at the right place (I'm always sinking)
but then I remember that it's hard to come home
without anything I could call my own (I'm always sinking)

down
I'm always sinking down
deeper and deeper
sometimes I wanna love you the way you are
I wanna hold your hand and look into your eyes

sometimes I wanna come home
wanna lay down in my bed
I wanna feel like being at the right place (I'm always sinking)
but then I remember that it's hard to come home
without anything I could call my own (I'm always sinking)

anything I could call my own
