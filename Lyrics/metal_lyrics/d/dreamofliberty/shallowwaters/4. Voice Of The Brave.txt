give me your voice
I have something to say
I want the whole world to listen
when I run for king [2x]

this is what we stand for
this is what we live for
we are born this way
to live our dreams

I accept nobody who gets in my way
this is the glorious rise of us
cause we all have a passion
and we spread it to the world

this is what we stand for
this is what we live for
we are born this way
to live our dreams

this ignorance in your eyes is gonna be your own demise
this hate in your heart is gonna be your fucking death

this is what we stand for
this is what we live for
we are born this way
to live our dreams
this is what we stand for
this is what we live for
we are born this way
to live our dreams
