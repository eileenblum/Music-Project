I've been there before to the deadest end.
Ain't never goin' back, I ain't got nothing to defend.
Flappin' wings and soarin' high might give you highs
But crashin' down the steepest
Hill is just what I advise.

[*]
DO IT YOURSELF! (You gotta live it)
DO IT YOURSELF! (You gotta give it)
DO IT YOURSELF! (It's your only chance, chance, chance)
I DO, I DO, I DO, I DO, I DO
I DO, I DO, I DO, I DO, I DO

Sick and tired of fools dancin' their routine.
Guess it's 'bout time to let them
In on the brand new scene.
Ain't got the time to fool around with all the clowns.
I've got to take care of business
Get my own thing down.

[Repeat *]

DANGERS ABOUND
BEASTS ARE AROUND
DANGERS ABOUND
BEASTS ARE AROUND

HA... I'M HERE TO GET YA
HA... HERE I COME... TO GET YA

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes, and there you go
Livin' today again like you're on the death row.
Ain't got the time to fool around with all the clowns.
I've got to take care of business
Get my own thing down.

[Repeat *]

I DO, I DO (KICK IT), I DO, I DO (GIVE IT)
I DO, I DO (SHAKE IT), I DO, I DO (BREAK IT)
