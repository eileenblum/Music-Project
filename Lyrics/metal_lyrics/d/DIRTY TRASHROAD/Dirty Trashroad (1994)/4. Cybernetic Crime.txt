Deeper, deeper in my eyes the shattered flames,
They're everywhere.
Purple haze, I try to find my way
Back through the memory maze I dare.
Searchin' for a future in the
Heart of urban hell disease.
I see the sun hangin' by the neck, leakin' it's grease.

I'll be back. I'm comin' to get ya.
The angel calls my name.

Sleepless souls in the Promised Land,
Hymns of ventilator screams.
Forgotten dreams of miracles,
All the optimistic schemes.
Destruction-bound, destruction-ruined,
Destruction and His preys.
Delusion-bound and delusion-ruined,
He's got His ways.

I'll be back. I'm comin' to get ya.
The angel calls my name.

CYBERNETIC CRIME... OH, OH, OH...
CYBERNETIC CRIME... OH, OH, OH...
CYBERNETIC CRIME... THROUGH AND THROUGH.
CYBERNETIC CRIME... OH, OH, OH...
CYBERNETIC CRIME... OH, OH, OH...
CYBERNETIC CRIME... WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

Down and out you mope and
Grope tryin' to find your way.
Wanna fight the owers-that-be
But they are here to stay.
Preachers sing 'Hallowed Be Thy Name'.
Don't you dare believe a word they're sayin'.
You'll never fall.
Gotta keep believin', baby, in your only light.
Don't you dare give up your fight, no.
You'll never fall.

[Repeat *]

You gotta fight the CRIME
