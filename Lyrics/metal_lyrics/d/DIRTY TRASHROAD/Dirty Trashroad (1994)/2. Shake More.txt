Why do I wanna step, step into this confusin' mess?
Carve into my tombstone all of my tension, my craziness.
Easy to criticize the choices forced on you.
I dare to walk the tightrope of danger that they brew.
YOU DON'T KNOW THE MESSIAH'S HERE
TO SAVE YOU, TO FREE
YOU FROM THE BLACKEST NIGHT

Pray yourself into a maze,
They make you dance on a stage of dreams.
No one's got it right yet,
Lurkin' inside their sleepy schemes.
Pain when we try to move away from where we are.
Goin' in circles tryin' to break, to break the bars.
DON'T WE KNOW THE MESSIAH'S HERE
TO SAVE AND FREE OUR SOULS
FROM THE BLACKEST NIGHT

SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE, WITH YOUR RAGE
(NEVER TOO LATE NOW)
SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE, TILL YOU KNOW
(WHAT YOU GONNA DO
DON'T JUST WAIT NOW)
SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE
YOU GOTTA LEND AN EAR,
FEEL THE SPIRIT WITH YOUR SOUL
DEATH LURKS BESIDE YOUR ANSWER.
MOVE TO GET THERE

Reachin' out to touch it, reality without any proof.
Lay my shackled body down, down.
I lost my words and all expression.
Look around the white room for scratches.
Time guides me to the limit now.

SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE, WITH YOUR RAGE
(NEVER TOO LATE NOW)
SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE, YOU'LL BE FREE
(HEY, YOU GOTTA MOVE TO BE FREE NOW)
SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE, WITH YOUR RAGE
(NEVER TOO LATE NOW)
SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE
OOH, YOU GOTTA MOVE
FEEL THE SPIRIT WITH YOUR SOUL
DEATH LURKS BESIDE YOUR SOUL

SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE...
SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE...

SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE...
SHAKE MORE, SHAKE MORE...
