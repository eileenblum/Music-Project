Hey, Mr.Cowboy!  Can't you see what you're doin'?
Workin' like a hog got you seesawin' and reelin'.
Sellin' your soul to the devil for a scrap of paper.
Can't plan your life cause you'll soon turn to vapor.

FREEWAY IS OUR KIND OF UTOPIA
FILL UP, FILL UP YOUR HORSE WITH GAS
GOTTA LIBERATE YOURSELF
FEEL THE SKY NOW, THE SKY IS
FOR ALL TO SEE, SO FREE

Hey, little sister! Let's go for a ride.
Break your walls and throw away
All your useless pride.
You think you know the worldly ways,
Let me show you my way.
You can't dance in the covenant now,
Won't you come out and play?

FREEWAY IS OUR KIND OF UTOPIA
FILL UP, FILL UP YOUR HORSE WITH GAS
GOTTA LIBERATE YOURSELF
FEEL THE SKY NOW, THE SKY IS
FOR ALL TO SEE, SO FREE

Hey, Mr. Wallstreet! Stop countin' all your dough.
Gotta stop fillin' yourself up,
Let the air guide your flow.
If you talk to the wind now,
She'll send you back her smile.
Spread your wings and let it out,
Gotta sing once in a while.

FREEWAY IS OUR KIND OF PLACE
LITTLE SISTER! LITTLE SISTER!
GOTTA LIBERATE YOURSELF
PLAY WITH ME NOW!
COME PLAY WITH ME NOW!

My sister, darlin'! Let's go for a ride.
Satisfaction guaranteed. I've got my own style.
My freeway is your kind of
Place and you're my kind of girl.
My freeway's yours.
