Ride the black wings of the holocaust angel
Across burning skies, raining acid and sulphur
Churches, governments will crumble and fall
As in heaven so below
As the wolves descend upon the flock of sheep
Watch a misanthropic generation bleed
As the wolves descend upon the flock of sheep
Another child born of the dead-end breed
Nihilism, rage, frustration realeased
A planet under siege, a final killing spree
There's no time for no fuckin' apologies
We're hitting you hard and
We're hitting you deep
Harder HARDER
Deeper DEEPER
