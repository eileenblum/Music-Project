I wake up seven in the evening,
Too scared to face another day
All the mirrors staring back at me
Guess I'll have to change my ways
The horrors of yesterday,
I live through them today
Today and everyday
I'm trying hard to keep it up
It's alright, I'm doing fine
It's OK, oh yeah,it's OK
Hatred and frustration building walls
Around our lives
Clock is ticking faster now,
A life of killing time still
I sleep with demons, a soul not longer mine
If only I could leave it,
Leave it all behind keep suppressing
All emotions in denial I've found peace
So come on and share my life and live through
My disease my disease
Hatred and frustration building walls around our lives
Clock is ticking faster now,
Faster day by day
Still I sleep with demons,
A soul not longer mine
If only I could make them,
Make them bastards pay
