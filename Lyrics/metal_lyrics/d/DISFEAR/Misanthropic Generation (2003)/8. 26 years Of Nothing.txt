Living life on my knees
Staring into the vulures eyes
Days go by in circles
In fear of another life
I give in to the darkness damned to face
Hell on my own life is a dead-end hated,
I stand alone now
I have seen what comes after this
And I'm terrified
Gonna take my stand now
I wont give up,
Not without a fight it's a race
To the end
This vicious circle of lies
No, never again the sun it will greet
My eyes trapped in a circle of lies
My life seems to be my crime
But with 26 years filled with nothing
I think that I've served my time
