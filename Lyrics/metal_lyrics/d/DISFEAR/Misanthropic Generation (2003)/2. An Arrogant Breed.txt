Alienated, isolated defiling a culture profane
Decay and repression interact the arrogant of power,
It remains masked we're arrogant breed
The spawn of the sum of mankind's greed
I'd give anything to be free
Free from the chains of your righteous dream
Oh yeah
Human values marginalized in a throw-away
Society in failure to feel all the worms
They will be revealed
We're arrogant breed
The spawn of the sum of mankind's greed
I'd give anything to be free
Free from the chains of hypocrisy
Oh yeah
