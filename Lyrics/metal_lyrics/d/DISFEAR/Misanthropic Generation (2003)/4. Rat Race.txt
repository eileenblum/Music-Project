Can you hear the vultures circle,
Above the living dead?
Cursed to live the 9 to 5
A struggle for their daily bread

I can taste the nausea
It's on your breath
The way you're livin' now
Will bring you to your death

I see the terror in your eyes
And I hear the horror in your cries
As you run around in circles
To save your sorry life

Like a rat in a cage
You panic from your daily grind
In suicidal rage
You live a life of constant strife
