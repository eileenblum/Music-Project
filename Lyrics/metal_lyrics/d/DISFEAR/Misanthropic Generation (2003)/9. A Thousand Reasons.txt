I've got a thousand reasons
As I pull the trigger
Deep inside
From myself I'll be released
I never knew it was a crime
Who gives a fuck about the system?
Or the truth behind their lies
There is creation in destruction
And alone I'll cross that line

I don't care about anything
I don't care â NO â not anymore
I don't care about anything
I don't care â NO â I just don't give a fuck

I've got a thousand reasons
As I pull the trigger
Deep inside
From your lies I'll be released
I never knew it was a crime
