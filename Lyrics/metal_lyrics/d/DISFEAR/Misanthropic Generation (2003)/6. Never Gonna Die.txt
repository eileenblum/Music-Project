In a fevered mind, stressed close to death
A constant urge for more
An uncontrolled burning surge
You can hear the hunger roar
I know that you know that I need
It now and you know that I need it
Fast a curse upon my wretched life
You know I'm never gonna last
Flashing lights and neon signs
Wasted nights nd dead-end lives
Desperation and bloodshoot eyes
A curse upon my wretched life
The voices in my head will tear me apart
A sinful symphony
No rest for the wicked,
The action obsessed
A psychotic nightmare realm
