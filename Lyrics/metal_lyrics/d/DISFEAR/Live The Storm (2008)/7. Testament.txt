We dream of poison
Of annihilating liberation
We are too young for mercy
We are the revolution
Come on!

When there's no more room in hell
The dead shall walk the earth
You say we are the future
When will you ever learn?

A testament
Born out of desperation
Life wasted on the living
The dead but dreaming youth

A generation staring
Into the blinding light of truth (of truth)
When there's no more room in hell
The dead shall walk the earth
You say we are the future
When will you ever learn?

A testament
Born out of desperation
A testament
Born out of desperation
A testament
Born out of desperation
A testament
Born out of desperation
A testament

Born out of nightmares
Denial, apathy and stress
You say we are the future
Yeah whatever will be left
A generation wasted
Cynical and bored to death

When there's no more room in hell
The dead shall walk the earth
You say we are the future
When will you ever learn?
A TESTAMENT [4x]
