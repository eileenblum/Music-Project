Propagating, entertaining
Rewriting and censoring
Our history desecrated adjust, adapt, obey
Teachers, media, politicians
And, yeah, your parents as well
Are either bought or just equally fucked

It's a one way communication
A deadweight population
It's a one way communication
I won't conform, no fucking way!

The burnt out, the anorectic
Part of the result
The naive, the so pathetic
And the non-reflecting cult
Ghosts of tomorrow, fear them today
Oh, yeah, fear them today
You better wake up before it's too late

One way communication
A deadweight population
It's a one way communication
I won't conform, no fucking way!
One way communication
A deadweight population
One way
Deadweight
One way
