There's a fire at the horizon
Infernal and divine

Majestic as a sunset
Burning in an orange line

The world will burn hard
In a withering fire

And will come to an end in a funeral pyre

The fiery father will come out of the sky
He shall strike upon us who were born to fry
Out of despair into a mass genocide
Souls swept away by his nuclear tide

A dark wind blows
Over this land of death

Pounding everything
Into a black smoking mess

The fury of flames
Inside our wounds

All that we pray for
Is death to come soon

The fiery father will come out of the sky
He shall strike upon us who were born to fry
Out of despair into a mass suicide
Souls swept away by his nuclear tide

Our gods are dethroned
By a mushroom cloud

Dead but dreaming
Alone in a crowd

Reduced to ashes
Naked and cold

In the not too distant future
I see death itself reload
