There's a place that we all return to
We stare ourselves in the face
A moment of clarity
Refuse to join the race
We release it all, over and over again
True to ourselves, we cannot fail

As you place your trust (As you place your trust)
In a system lost (In a system lost)
All will turn to dust,
All will turn to rust
In exodus,
In exodus

To live for the feeling of when it all explodes
A blessing or a curse
We burn out, we burn out
Born in darkness, born too late
We leave ashes in our wake
Leave it all behind, leave it all behind

As you place your trust (As you place your trust)
In a system lost (In a system lost)
All will turn to dust,
All will turn to rust
In exodus,
In exodus

We leave only to return again
Retaliation on blackened wings descends
We are the living end, we are the endless void
We gather in flocks, we search and destroy
We leave only to return again
We leave only to return again

As you place your trust
In a system lost
In exodus,
In exodus
There's a place that we all return to
We stare ourselves in the face (In exodus)
A moment of clarity
Refuse to join the race (In exodus)
We release it all, over and over again (In exodus)
True to ourselves, we cannot fail
