To live the storm
Free from all of your norms
A generation at war
Your days and nights we swarm
Into the white heat, into the unknown

One with the storm
All your decisions, yours alone
Into the unruly night
To search, to search and destroy

Into the white heat, into the unknown
Go!

To overthrow and tear down all that came before
A constant urge for more
Your gods are now dethroned
Into the white heat, into the unknown

To live the storm
With the eagles soar
Into the unknown
A future including no closed doors...
No closed doors

To live the storm
Into the white heat, into the unknown
To live the storm
