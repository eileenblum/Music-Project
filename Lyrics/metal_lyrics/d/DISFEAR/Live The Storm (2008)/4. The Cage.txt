Dogmas put on podiums
Swallow blind the bait
Prime-time advertised, prostitution
In darkness we hibernate
Depravity will take human form
Let self-destruction be the norm

We will not know the end
We will all be numb by then

Collective destructive behaviour
Precise and clean self-mutilation
Soft skin, hardened surgical scars
Methadone addiction
Recreational narcotics
Balanced and controlled
No reflection in the mirror
The cage inside us all

Apathy, the sharpest weapon
A respect built on abuse
So thin, so transparent
Brought up on diet truth
Painted up in weekend bliss
So afraid of what we might miss
Comfort or freedom, you can't have both
Sharpen the knives, go for their throats

Collective destructive behaviour
Precise and clean self-mutilation
Soft skin, hardened surgical scars
Methadone addiction
Recreational narcotics
Balanced and controlled
No reflection in the mirror
The cage inside us all

Apathy, the sharpest weapon
A respect built on abuse
So thin, so transparent
Brought up on diet truth
The longer we dwell on in silence
The less that we question ourselves
The next generation, our children
Will have no rights left to protect.

Collective destructive behaviour
Precise and clean self-mutilation
Soft skin, hardened surgical scars
Methadone addiction
Recreational narcotics
Balanced and controlled
No reflection in the mirror
Unseen, expendable
The cage inside us all
