We live in a labyrinth, live in a maze
Twisted and broken; worn out, thrown away

We're in search of more time, in search for a meaning
Break my back, you cannot break my hope,

Cause now I just wanna get it off! (get it off)
Get it off my back, (get it off)
I just wanna get it off! (get it off)
Get it off my back,

For 50 long years now my body gave profit
So faithful in service, time heals nothing

Work as your social life, work as your drug
The comfort it offered, was it worth the pain?

Cause now I just wanna get it off! (get it off)
Get it off my back, (get it off)
I just wanna get it off! (get it off)
Get it off my back, now!

Stand up and be counted
Proud in your failure
Stand up and be counted
Now is the time to reclaim
Your life, your time, your rights, your pride
Stand up and be counted [3x]

Cause now I just wanna get it off! (get it off)
Get it off my back, (get it off)
I just wanna get it off! (get it off)
Get it off my back, (get it off)
I just wanna get it off! 6x
Get it off
