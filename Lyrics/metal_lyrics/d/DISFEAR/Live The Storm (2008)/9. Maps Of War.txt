All hail democracy, hypocrisy
Promote the war campaign
A calculated risk
The numbers that are slain
Election year is here
We gather round a cause
In the weapon industry
We place our votes

For I promote oblivion (oblivion)
Let the maps of war be drawn
We are but pawns in their power schemes
All hail (all hail) the new clear dawn

As history repeats itself
Behind closed doors
Lesser gods of higher rank
Prodding us to war
The iron dream a burning curse
We will never learn
For god, for oil, for land
Lines are drawn in the sand

For I promote oblivion (oblivion)
Let the maps of war be drawn
We are but pawns in their power schemes
All hail (all hail) the new clear dawn

On public demand, oblivion (oblivion)
The seeds of hate are sown
We are but pawns in their power schemes
All hail... the new clear dawn
For I promote oblivion (oblivion)
Let the maps of war be drawn
We are but pawns in their power schemes
All hail (all hail) the new clear dawn
