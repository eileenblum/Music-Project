Our cities are but sewers
Where rats in suits stalk their prey
Paper-pushing corporate swine
Crushed by their own weight
It's a proper dystopian hell
Another lesson learned too late
And no one will live to tell

Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
All seeing, yet alive
Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
We disappear, take flight

You cellphone-sporting corpses
Choking on your cosmetics
The winning team will be the most numb, the most pathetic
A destructive lifestyle we celebrate
A testament of the depraved
Do you really want to be saved?

Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
All seeing, yet alive
Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
We disappear, take flight

Do you really want to be saved?
Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
All seeing, yet alive
Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
We disappear, take flight
Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
All seeing, yet alive
Primitive, yet refined, the furnace
We disappear, take flight
The furnace
The furnace
The furnace
