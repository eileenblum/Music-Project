The silence that evolves into a whitering life without hope
Has come to carry a shuffled mind in a world of disorder
The reflection that I see does not reflect what I used to be

Yet another wisdom gives me a chance to find a way to retrieve what's lost
a Shining throne

I am succumbed in nightmares
Please tell me what's real and what's not
I see several visions
I am lost in another source and I find it hard to weave the sanity together by myself

But soon the ship sets course
As the elder one will sink to the bottom
And assist to unravel the pieces that is hid inside

Yet another wisdom gives me a chance to find a way to retrieve what's lost
The Shining throne

A new epoch has begun
And this time there is no rerun

Yet another wisdom gives me a chance to find a way to retrieve what's lost
The Shining throne before me
