An endless horizon
With nothing to find except the bottomless ocean
Where the surface smoulders by a million lifetimes of regret
A history full of unfulfilment
This revelation is definite

Will the wind grant me speed as the water is pouring in, in my lake?

I am cornered
The architects directs me
Follow the blueprint
I'll might survive, but I won't live
I sail towards the stream
I don't want guidance!
Go let me be!

Will the wind grant me speed as the water is pouring in?
Will the wind grant me speed as the water is pouring in, in my lake?

Will the wind grant me speed as the water is pouring in, in my lake?

Let me BE!
