Washed away by this subconscious travesty
Away from everything that is me
Deranged - a forfeit by my negligent brain
There's nothing to redeem

This abyss of dreams has taken away my enlightened fate
I devoted my life to this fantasy

Ascending from the dream
This message will prevail
Born again

I need to reclaim the heartbeat and flame
To reclaim the spark that left me
I rise from the fog that fed these lies
It's my time to roll the dice of destiny

Ascending from the dream
This message will prevail
Born again

Absorb yourself through disaster
And a portal will open
To guide your soul, your soul

Ascending from the dream
This message will prevail
Born again
