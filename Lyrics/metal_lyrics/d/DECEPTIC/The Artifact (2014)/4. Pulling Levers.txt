Oh you soothing light
The torch of signs
Preserve the tool of guidelines
For you are still keeping me blind

Borrowed constricted eyes
Slender peripheral sight
What have I done to spend a life in this mold?
Copy and paste, and the ropes on your feet will ease
The gray skin might be warm, but be aware it wear thorns
And you wear it inside out

Will I ever pull the lever?
To release what's beneath my skin

Another year inside this coma
Whatching my soul coagulate
But my echoes has lingered for the very last time
Unchain my mind
I am through with self-deceit
It's time to face what's beneath

Will I ever pull the lever?
To release what's beneath my skin
