I silence all essential desires
To make room
For the black hole is always around me
Since the dawn of time I've strived for the essence
That makes one divine but the goal is constantly changing
But i'm not questioning my belief
The stones are being turned and thrown
I feed on whatever that will quench my thirst

Lead Astray From the path that should have awakened me
Away
It drags me down and depletes my identity

Watered down and withered
You've become so unwanted
As much as I want to relive it, I see no joy in second encounters
So old and so useless I sit on the shadow's throne

Lead Astray From the path that should have awakened me
Away
It drags me down and depletes my identity

I silence all essential desires to make room for the black hole
Always around me
Since the dawn of time i've strived for the essence
That makes one divine but the goal is constantly changing
All torned and withered
Am I the one who has become so unwanted
Am I so old, so obsessed and useless?
dissolve
I just want to be whole
Let go!
My house is made of gold
But no one bangs on my door

Lead Astray From the path that should have awakened me
Away
It drags me down and depletes my identity
