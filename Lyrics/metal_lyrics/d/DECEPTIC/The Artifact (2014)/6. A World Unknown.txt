We are the soil that contaminates this river
When history has burned down to ash
The ground as we know has degenerated and degraded

The cycle that we follow takes a turn
We deflect what we inherit

We are waiting for
Abuse, plunder, anguish, decay, envy and pain
Was it something we came for?
Our only need
To breed and feed
Consume and leech

A creation of our own
From the past has come to show
That we are living in a world unknown

Undo our misery to redo our own legacy
Reboot the system, and start it all over again

We are waiting for
Our only need
To breed and feed
Consume and leech

A creation of our own
From the past has come to show
That we are living in a world unknown
