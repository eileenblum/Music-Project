The cradle that used to rock me
Has come to be a futile bowl of agony
The second I faced it I realized, the future is now
As soon as my wings unfolds itself a path will emerge
To strike into a brighter dimension
It scars to leave the past but I'll be better of like that
Compared to an outcast

With one step closer to the end
Life finds a way
And we have nothing to regret

Old fears that dwells so deep from the inside
Has come to shape a new mind
And endless cloud that shrouds the ray of light I strive towards
Without adversity there will be no prosperity

With one step closer to the end
Life finds a way
And we have nothing to regret
