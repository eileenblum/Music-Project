Disintegrated mass
Quaking visions
Transfixed and succumbed by the ample expectations
Depraved and crippled by life

Scarred and no will to stand
Fatigued and betrayed by your own flesh
Habits erased, so degraded and vile
It consumes your soul
And there's no one to save you now

The shell that I once had is now broken
The picture in the mirror
Slowly fading

Polluted and a lacking brain that deceives
Tormented, afflicted and facing defeat
Sore from breathing, there's nothing left to achieve
Separate defects from this world

The shell that I once had is now broken
The picture in the mirror
Slowly fading

So I'm fading
But I am still feeling the flame in me
I turn the handle to welcome the light
Breathe me in...
