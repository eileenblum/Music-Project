We've fought through the shadows of the lost
Like a never-ending wave we push on no matter what's in the way
Forget about time, about the sand in the glass
As we've set our course straight into the midst of the waking hydras

Inside the heart of the swarm we feel whatever that will hit us
What doesn't hurt ain't worth a single hell on this earth
So go close your eyes and conjoin into one, and strentghen the torn

The road gets thinner now
A single reckless move could be the very end of it all
So if I fall, remember the moment we shared on the battlefield
All that we gained and lost, but it was worth the cost

We have fought through shadows
Like a never-ending wave we push through everything

Inside the heart of the swarm we feel whatever that will hit us
What doesn't hurt ain't worth a single hell on this earth
So go close your eyes and conjoin into one, and strentghen the torn
