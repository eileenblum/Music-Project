A sudden burst!
The cup was filled but now the ground starts to quake
Was it meant to be?
To have a house built just to throw away the key?

When the darkenss is being hit by light
The antagonist will emerge
Smorgasbord of shame arise on this table that I call life

It's almost like I want you to ruin this
So that I can see you fall into the depths of the forgotten
Incompatible from start
Now I know why I got pushed aside
My destiny is immune to parasites

When the darkenss is being hit by light
The antagonist will emerge
Smorgasbord of shame arise on this table that I call life
