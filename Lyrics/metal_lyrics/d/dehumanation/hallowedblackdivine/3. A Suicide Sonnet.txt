arteries wept for a blade
flesh with joy divides
nerves a'raised
endings frayed
as gasping breaths collide
misery groped for her twin
in burning darkness cried
next of kin
to sister sin
the bitch found only lies

elegant spray of carnal red
a splash of life's warm tide
gently spreads
a sickened threat
of hope that will not die
the kiss of steel tastes so sweet
bite down and close your eyes
splattered scene
of shredded meat
an expert suicide
