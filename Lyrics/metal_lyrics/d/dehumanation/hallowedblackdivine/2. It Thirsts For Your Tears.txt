self-immolation
black flames arise
birth, life, death, rebirth
endlessly we strive
twist ourselves up in
blood-encrusted gears
hungry, the machine
thirsting for our tears

hungry, the machine
thirsting for our tears
cold, impersonal
rapes the young of years
with a taste for grief
devouring your heart
savoring your pain
suffering is its art

raise the banner high
steel yourself to die
highest sacrifice
give your god your life
in times of war
raise the banner high
in times of war
prepare to die
