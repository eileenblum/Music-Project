dust upon the altars
defloration thy wine
choke upon the loathsome
rotten depths inside
sickening inundations
impassioned wretching tides
taste the sweet repugnance
the hallowed black divine

hallowed black divine
hallowed black divine

a throbbing empty gash
where once the spirit dwelt
you sought to fill the emptiness
before the altar knelt
raise the axe of marduk
by mj?llnir smash the lies
crush the aten
flay your serpent
praise the god inside

hallowed black divine
hallowed black divine
hallowed black divine
hallowed black divine

wreckage and debris of countless vile wars
christians hang on crosses nailed up by the score
vultures feast on eyes and pull at swollen lips
maggots breed in festered wounds
opened by our whips

hallowed black divine
hallowed black divine
hallowed black divine
hallowed black divine
