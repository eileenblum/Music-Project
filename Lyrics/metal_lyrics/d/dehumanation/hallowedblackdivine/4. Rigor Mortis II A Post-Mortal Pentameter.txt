throat cut like flowers
sufferings manifold
gargling with blood
larnyx starts to mould

rupturing tableaux
all six feet below

no faceless horror
ripped your life away
knowledge of the end
lit your final days

gaping mouths of rot
clamor for your kiss
a fetid orgy
bursts upon your lips

symphonies of stench
decompose within
your lifeless carcass
a hellacious din

deafened in the pit
writhing in the crypt
rupturing tableaux
all six feet below

rigor mortis: clenched
in the throes of death
