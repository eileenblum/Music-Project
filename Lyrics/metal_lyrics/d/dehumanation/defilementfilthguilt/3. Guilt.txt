screaming muted silent
purging emptiness
ravenous and bloated
nurtured pestilence
clenching in the shadows
writhing in the light
destitute of purpose
void of life inside

empty eyes, rotten filth
stench of shame
reek of guilt
self-inflict, tortured skin
snapping bones
twisting limbs

abscess in the fractures
blistered frigid rape
vomiting in velvet
pissing on your face
incongruous insults
carnage in the crib
infantile regression
no excuse to live

empty eyes, rotten filth
stench of shame
reek of guilt
self-inflict, tortured skin
snapping bones
twisting limbs

DEFILEMENT is dedicated to Jennifer Haddock.
FILTH is dedicated to the kings of American black metal, PROFANATICA.
GUILT is dedicated to Maniac.
