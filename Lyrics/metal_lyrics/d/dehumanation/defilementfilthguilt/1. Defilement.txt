mercy is a fist, ecstasy a whip
defilement a sacrament poisoned with a kiss
holiness in sin, covenant of pain
so debased, atone your faith and feel me deep within

sanctified to bleed, grace of agony
violate, humiliate, i cleanse you of your screams
romance in disgust, a vile bursting pust
overflows in our divine and filthy guilty lust

in shame i control you
in disdain i must hold you
in chains i redeem you
in pain i release you
