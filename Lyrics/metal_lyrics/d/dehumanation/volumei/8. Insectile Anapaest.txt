sing of the past and of secret demise
through ageless and humid colorless nights
deep from a gullet of insectile form
ten thousand plagues here wait to be born

sing of our errors and whisper the truth
maddening shrieks through the maryland june
six weeks you live yet your young will again
emerge seventeen years after you're dead

sing sing your song of doom

timeless the voice of a species so blessed
with truncated lives and forgetful deaths
but i'lll remember your ungodly screams
counting the years 'til your next symphony

sing sing your song of doom
