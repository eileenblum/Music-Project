none shall mourn the human wake
whisper your goodbyes
silence chokes your final prayers
and fear opens your eyes

we ourselves shall write the end
we've spread like parasites
pestilence culminates
in genetic suicide

sentient virus, rape the land
as flesh gives way to steel
redemption far beyond our grasp
and none of us can feel

together we've devised the end
and thus incinerate
mankind's pinnacle of strength:
undone by our own hate
