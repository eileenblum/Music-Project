a nameless terror
mute abstracts of fear
death smiles on your heart
pulse soon disappears

slick tongues of madness
taste of your sick lust
raped of will to move
thence rigor mortis

synapses shut down
muscles start to seize
death's harsh aroma is
all you can breathe

locked in your shudders
gripped by swift decay
soon the faceless horror
rips your life away
