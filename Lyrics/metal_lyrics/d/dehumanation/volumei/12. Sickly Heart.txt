slice me open, check my pulse
see my sickly heart exposed
gutted spirit, dissected soul
rip me open tear at the hole

this is how it feels

crippled in emotion
rotten with contempt
poisoning humanity is all the joy i've left

oh to watch you suffer, i adore your tragedies
oh to see you suffer
to watch as you turn into me...

this is how it feels
