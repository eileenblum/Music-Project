pale and anonymous under flourescent lights
i hear your flesh beg to be separated from bone
with the glinting secret of my hatred to be borne
by your temple before your very god

hatred: formulae
rage - cursed - blood - vile
breathing necropsy
brutal torture reigning supreme

purged, cleansed
sterile - fateless - reborn
torturous existence: terminal

living autopsy
slice - carve - sculpt - bleed
depthless forensics
incise - engorge - vomit
dissect

living autopsy
