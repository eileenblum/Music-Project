found alone: stripped, beaten - sliced beyond ID
six days dead, drawing flies
missing toes and teeth
maggots had begun to boil underneath her face
beetles fucked and shit in her hair
and dined on the decay

dined on the decay

sun spilled down on her breasts: livid, turning blue
crucifix between her legs
seems was jammed straight through
innards stretched from her waist, wrapped around her neck
perfect lust in her life
perfect art in death
