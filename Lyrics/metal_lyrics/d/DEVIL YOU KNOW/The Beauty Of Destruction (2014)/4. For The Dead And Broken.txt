Can you see me, through the smoke and the fear
Understanding all I wanted to hear
One lonely voice
One simple choice

From within the light a greater darkness
Sleepless nights and tortured days

I'm living for the dead and broken
And through the ashes I have spoken
All the strength I have was stolen
But through the ashes I have spoken

Can you see me, I'm still standing here
Everlasting since I've seen your tears
One lonely soul
One empty soul

From within the light a greater darkness
Sleepless nights and tortured days

I'm living for the dead and broken
And through the ashes I have spoken
All the strength I have was stolen
But through the ashes I have spoken

I'm living for the dead and broken
And through the ashes I have spoken
All the strength I have was stolen
But through the ashes I have spoken
