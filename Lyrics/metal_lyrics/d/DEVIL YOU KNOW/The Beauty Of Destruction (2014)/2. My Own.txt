I've been fighting every day of my life
Against my demons, against my limitations
Torn between death and desolation
I greet each challenge with expectation

This path I walk is my own
Against all I stand alone

These wounds will heal even if the scars remain
A constant reminder of the knowledge I have gained
Even if I fail, with all I am I have tried
I press forward, I will not be satisfied

This path I walk is my own
Against all I stand alone
And you can say what you will
Cause I'll be holding strong
Against all I stand alone

These are my choices
I will not back down
This life is my design
I will bear this crown

This path I walk is my own
Against all I stand alone
And you can say what you will
Cause I'll be holding strong
Against all I stand alone
