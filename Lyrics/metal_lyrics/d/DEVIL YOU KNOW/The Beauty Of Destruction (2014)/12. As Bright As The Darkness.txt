I've become the ghost you know
Where time moves too slow
It's been far too long
Since I've seen another face
In this empty space

When you've seen it all
It becomes so clear
That each day can bring
A new set of fears
When you can't see the truth
It's as bright as the darkness
When the enemy's you
It's as bright as the darkness

I want nothing more
Just something to live for
It's been far too long
Since I could even smile
Just for a little while

When you've seen it all
It becomes so clear
That each day can bring
A new set of fears
When you can't see the truth
It's as bright as the darkness
When the enemy's you
It's as bright as the darkness

I sit and stare at the door
There's nowhere to run anymore
I am fading away

When you've seen it all
It becomes so clear
That each day can bring
A new set of fears
When you can't see the truth
It's as bright as the darkness
When the enemy's you
It's as bright as the darkness
