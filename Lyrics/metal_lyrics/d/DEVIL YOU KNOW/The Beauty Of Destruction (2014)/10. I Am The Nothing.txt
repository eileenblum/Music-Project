I lost everything in the blink of an eye
Wandering nowhere through space and time
I shoud have known that someway someday
You would find your way back to my arms

Within my dreams
I am the unknown, I am the nothing
You will find me
Where I am the unknown, I am the nothing

You put your heart on the line when days turn to nights
Lost in the shadows of space and time
You gave me the strength to stand on my own
And then you found your way back to my arms

Within my dreams
I am the unknown, I am the nothing
You will find me
I am the unknown, I am the nothing

I am the nothing

Within my dreams
I am the unknown, I am the nothing
You will find me
Where I am the unknown, I am the nothing

Within my dreams
I am the unknown, I am the nothing

I am the unknown, I am the nothing
