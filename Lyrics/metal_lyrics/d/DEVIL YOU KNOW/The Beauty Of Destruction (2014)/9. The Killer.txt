Flowers die, die in my hand
I am the killer
I'll be the one to open up the wounds you're bleeding
You didn't learn
You should've known to keep your distance

Stay away from me

I'll give you everything
If you drink from the poison
I swear I will watch you die
Because my love is the poison
Stay away

You will walk with black skies
I am the killer
I'll be the one who's watching you as you're drowning
Every word I've ever said has been a warning

Stay away from me

I'll give you everything
If you drink from the poison
I swear I will watch you die
Because my love is the poison
Stay away, stay away

I'll give you everything
If you drink from the poison
I swear I will watch you die
Because my love is the poison
Stay away, stay away
Stay away
