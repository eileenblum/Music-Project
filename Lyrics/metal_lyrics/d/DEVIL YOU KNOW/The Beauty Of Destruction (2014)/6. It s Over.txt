All my life I've waited for you
Simply because I knew you were there
In the blink of an eye, it turned so cold
This is the end, this is despair
Now it's over

(You were the one)
Say goodbye, it's over
(The only one)
No more tears, it's over
(You were the one)
Turn away, it's over
(The only one)
Nothing to say, it's over
You won't see me again

In my dreams I call your name
You had become the air I breathe
With three words time stood still
Love turns black, love can kill
Now it's over

(You were the one)
Say goodbye, it's over
(The only one)
No more tears, it's over
(You were the one)
Turn away, it's over
(The only one)
Nothing to say, it's over
You won't see me again
You won't see me again

(You were the one)
Say goodbye, it's over
(The only one)
No more tears, it's over
(You were the one)
Turn away, it's over
(The only one)
Nothing to say, it's over
You won't see me again
You won't see me again
