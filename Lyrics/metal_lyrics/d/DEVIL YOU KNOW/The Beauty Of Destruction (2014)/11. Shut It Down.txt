This war should have ended so long ago
But turning back the hands of time is useless
This war is never ending, it's all we know
We've wasted more than just our hear and souls

Staring down the barrel of a gun
Visions and flashes and reflections of the moster I've become
Then I realize

Something more calling upon me
To leave this life of death
Shut it down before the light is failing
Now I'm (holding on) I'm (reaching for) I'm (something more)
Shut it down

This fight has made me weary now, now I must rise
Or everything that I've created dies
This fight it seems eternal but now I know
That through it all I'll never be alone

Seperation from everything I've stood for
Became the tomb that embraced and buried me
But I hear a voice

Something more calling upon me
To leave this life of death
Shut it down before the light is failing
Now I'm (holding on) I'm (reaching for) I'm (something more)
Shut it down

Contemplation of self-destruction erasing the weight that I bear
Leaving a trail of existence that now remains
Cold to the touch and despair
Rise and face my demons
I will suffer no more

Something more calling upon me
To leave this life of death
Shut it down before the light is failing
Now I'm (holding on) I'm (reaching for) I'm (something more)
Shut it down
