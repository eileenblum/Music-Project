Turn my back on the world
Let my heart grow cold
I bled the light from my soul
Like a dying sun

From the ashes resurrected

I must crawl, crawl from the dark
Crawl before I fall back down
Back to the start

I started too many fires
And as I watched them burn down
Fade the light from my eyes
Stolen from the sun

From the ashes resurrected

I must crawl, crawl from the dark
Crawl before I fall back down
Back to the start

There's still a spark
And to ignite I've got to go
Crawl, crawl from the dark

I must crawl, crawl from the dark
Crawl before I fall back down
Back to the start

There's still a spark
And to ignite I've got to go
Crawl, crawl from the dark
