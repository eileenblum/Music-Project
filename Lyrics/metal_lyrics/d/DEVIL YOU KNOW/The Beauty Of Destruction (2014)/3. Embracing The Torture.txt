One more brick to build my wall
While burning the wings of the angel
She's guilty of loving me
One more drink to hide it all
Until the dream is over
And I feel the fire consume me

In the darkness I'm freezing
My soul won't stop bleeding again
It's never enough
In the cold winter sunlight
Embracing the torture again
It's never enough

There's no way to see my fall
The lies and empty promises
Can be so demanding
Pain I felt I gave out more
Knowing I deceived myself
Has made me a mockery

In the darkness I'm freezing
My soul won't stop bleeding again
It's never enough
In the cold winter sunlight
Embracing the torture again
It's never enough

One more brick to build my wall
Never enough
One more brick to build my wall
Never enough

In the darkness I'm freezing
My soul won't stop bleeding again
It's never enough
In the cold winter sunlight
Embracing the torture again
It's never enough

One more brick to build my wall
Never enough
One more brick to build my wall
Never enough
