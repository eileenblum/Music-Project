Buried below the grave
There is nothing but the dirt and the dark
Affliction is just the start
Of eternity's embrace

There is no sleep
In the burning sulfur

Falling deeper into the nothingness
Into the depths of my mind insane

There is no death for the fallen
There are no tears for the cursed
Time is the blade that tears your flesh
You will suffer in horror

There is no sleep
In the burning sulfur

Falling deeper into the nothingness

The walls are closing in
And the nightmare never ends
Into the depths of my mind insane

You will relive your torment
You will relive your anguish

Falling deeper into the nothingness
Falling deeper into the nothingness

The walls are closing in
And the nightmare never ends
