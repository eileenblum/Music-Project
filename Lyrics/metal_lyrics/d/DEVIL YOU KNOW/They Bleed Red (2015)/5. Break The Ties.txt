To the end of the earth we run.
Blistering from the rising sun.
And we know that we don't belong.
Where did we take a turn so wrong?

I've laid it all on the altar.
I've stumble but never falter.

Forever bound!
Break the ties!

We're so much more than sacrificial lambs, look past the sky.
I'll never run, run from you again!
I'll never run, run again!

The end of the world has begun.
Our fortress has it come undone.
This is everything that we chose.
All we are and all that we oppose.

A valley carved right between us.
Climb the mountain, but can we fix this?

Forever bound!
Break the ties!

We're so much more than sacrificial lambs, look past the sky.
I'll never run, run from you again!
I'll never run, run again!

Once more we offer ourselves.
We know we don't belong.
Where did I go wrong?

Let's break the ties!
We're so much more than sacrificial lambs.

Break the ties!

We're so much more than sacrificial lambs, look past the sky.
I'll never run, run from you again!
I'll never run, run again!
