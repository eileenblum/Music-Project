Burn my sins, suffer persecution.
Tell me the price for a stay of execution.

I failed once again to see the truth from the lies.
I've fallen again, watching through sightless eyes.
I can't go back where I lost who I am.
A lapse in time where the sickness began.

Burn my sins, suffer persecution.
Tell me the price for a stay of execution.

One choice, one life.

I see clear, broken pieces realign.
The only thing I fear, I'm running out of time.
Before the broken pieces realign.

I'm still reaching for what I'll never grasp.
Just your mercy is all I'll ever ask.

I see clear, broken pieces realign.
The only thing I fear, I'm running out of time.
I see clear, broken pieces realign.
The only thing I fear, I'm running out of time.

One choice, one choice, one life.
One choice, one choice, one life.
One choice, one choice, one life.
My choice, my choice, my life!

One choice, one life.
I'm running out of time.
One choice, one life.
I'm running out of time.

One choice, one life.
I'm running out of time.
One choice, one life.
I'm running out of time.
