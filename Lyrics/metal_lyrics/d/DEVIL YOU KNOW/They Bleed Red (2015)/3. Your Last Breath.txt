We are in motion.
Ever changing, ever evolving.
Make a decision.
Death awaits in hesitation.

The growing pain of each passing day.
Look to those who never turn away.

I'm lost in the  wake of nothing.
Caught up in a storm of the empty truth.
This isn't the end or your last breath
The battle for life, I will see this through.

We will pick up the pieces.
It's time to forge ahead.
This is a new start!
We rebuild it from the ashes.

The growing pain of each passing day.
Look to those who never turn away.

I'm lost in the  wake of nothing.
Caught up in a storm of the empty truth.
This isn't the end or your last breath
The battle for life, I will see this through.

Pick up the pieces, forge ahead.

We cauterize the wounds.
Forever branding me to you.

I'm lost in the  wake of nothing.
Caught up in a storm of the empty truth.
This isn't the end or your last breath
The battle for life, I will see this through.

This isn't the end or your last breath
The battle for life, I will see this through.

See this through.
