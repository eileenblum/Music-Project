Will you stand and be counted, a leader among the hopeless.
Go forth and be the one to rise above the waste.

Inactive, immobile.
No more time to wait.

Moving, this is the way we die.
Forward with our hands held high.
Onward, we are the order piercing forward to the end.

This is the way we die!

The reflections speak for themselves, so hollow inside of our eyes.
The sun is life incarnate to rise above the waste.

Inactive, immobile.
No more time to wait.

Moving, this is the way we die.
Forward with our hands held high.
Onward, we are the order piercing forward to the end.

Will you stand to be the one, a leader to rise above the waste?
Rise above!

Moving, this is the way we die.
Forward with our hands held high.
Onward, we are the order piercing forward to the end.

This is the way we die!

We are the order piercing forward.
This is the way we die!
We are the order piercing forward.
This is the way we die!
