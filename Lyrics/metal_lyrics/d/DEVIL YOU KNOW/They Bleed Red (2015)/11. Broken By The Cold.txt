Suffocate and do you know why?
Desperate to destroy the lies.

Fatal words are gone!
Empty threats are all you are.
You're a living proof.
Regret will seal your doom.

You walk with the lost.
Isolation, the only cost.
How long will you last?
Suffer and deal with your past.

Your secrets have nowhere, nowhere to hide.

Taking what's left, the price to be alone.
Can you hold, before you're broken by the cold?

When you lose all hope.
Finhd yourself so far below.
There's still light inside.
Reach out and break through the tide.

Your secrets have nowhere, nowhere to hide.

Taking what's left, the price to be alone.
Can you hold, before you're broken by the cold?

Broken by the cold, face your fears.

You can face the fears, the signs are in your tears.
How long can you hold, before it slips away?

Taking what's left, the price to be alone.
Can you hold, before you're broken by the cold?
Taking what's left, the price to be alone.
Can you hold, before you're broken by the cold?
