Hidden in plain sight, did all I can do.
Watching you lose the fight, will you stay alive?
I am no saviour, but I will take all of the weight that you carry.
If you will let go, will the past become buried in time.

Overcome with a sense of destruction.
Overcome with a lack of emotion.

Gave up the fight to live, but the season will pass.
Letting the pain take hold and I know we can reach for the light.
Gave up the fight.

Timing is never right, fear will ruin you.
Wake from the endless night, open up your eyes.

Gave up the fight to live, but the season will pass.
Letting the pain take hold and I know we can reach for the light.
Gave up the fight, gave up the fight.

Will you leave us with nothing, the past buried in time.
Buried in time!

Overcome with a sense of destruction.
Overcome with a lack of emotion.

Gave up the fight to live, but the season will pass.
Letting the pain take hold and I know we can reach for the light.

Gave up the fight, but the season will pass.
Gave up the fight and I know we can reach for the light.

Gave up the fight.
