You dare to cast your faceless stones.
As you sit upon your throne, you are the king of nothing.

I cast you down, I'll watch you stumble.
I cast you down, allegiance crumbles.

Any control you thought you had, melts away with each breath I take.

You are the judge of nothing and you do not know me.
If you cut your own throat, this is how the end shall be.

This marks the end of your influence.
This marks the end, you stand in ruins.

Let the foolish follow you.
You'll never have a home here.

You are the judge of nothing and you do not know me.
If you cut your own throat, we will rejoice we are the opposed.
You are the judge of nothing and you do not know me.
If you cut your own throat, this is how the end shall be.

For the rest of my days you mean nothing to me.

Join the voice of those who oppose at the end of the rope.
Join the voice of those who oppose at the end of the rope.

You are the unwanted and it's too late to change.
You are the unwanted and it's too late.

You are the judge of nothing and you do not know me.
If you cut your own throat, we will rejoice we are the opposed.
You are the judge of nothing and you do not know me.
If you cut your own throat, this is how the end shall be.
