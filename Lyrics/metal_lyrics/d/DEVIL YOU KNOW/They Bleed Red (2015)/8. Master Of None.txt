I wear a crown of thorns and the blood flows easily.
I can only see what's broken, this is the way of life for me.

I never laughed so easily, I never cried so hard.
I've never stood so high above, I've never fallen so far.

What can I do?
My God, what have I done?
I crave the darkness.
What have I become?

I am the master of none, I am the Devil you know.
What have I become?

I have destroyed all creation, still hanging from the noose.
My screams echo all around me, I pray to be cut loose.

I never laughed so easily, I never cried so hard.
I've never stood so high above, I've never fallen so far.

What can I do?
My God, what have I done?
I crave the darkness.
What have I become?

I'm the master of none!
No chance to seek forgiveness.
I will reap what I sow.
I'm the Devil you know.

Is this the fate I accept?
Living a life of regret.
No chance to see the sun.
My God, what have I done?

I am the master of none, I am the Devil you know.

I'm the master of none, what have I become?
No chance to seek forgiveness.
I will reap what I sow, what have I become?
I'm the Devil you know.

No chance to seek forgiveness.
No chance for retribution.
No chance to atone for our sins.

I'm the Devil you know.
I'm the Devil you know.
I will reap what I sow.
I'm the Devil you know.

I will reap what I sow.
I'm the Devil you know.
