The killing fields, a revolution.

Careless with the gifts we've been given.
Cast aside the way of the weak.
Place your faith in yourself.
Change comes to slow, so let's take control.

Make no mistake, let these words ring clear.
We move as one, there is no fear.

Make your choice, shatter silence.
Our voice, the only solution.
We won't walk in the shadows.
The killing fields, a revolution.

The killing fields, a revolution.

We hold the key to a better way of life.
This is our destiny, this is why we fight.
Paradise is more than a dream.
I will give my all, I will pay the price.

Make no mistake, let these words ring clear.
We move as one, there is no fear.

Make your choice, shatter silence.
Our voice, the only solution.
We won't walk in the shadows.
The killing fields, a revolution.

Ripping back the unknown.
Exposing all that was hidden.
The weakness shows in the eyes of those, 
who have reason to fear what we find!

Fear what we find!

Make your choice, shatter silence.
Our voice, the only solution.
We won't walk in the shadows.
The killing fields, a revolution.

The killing fields, a revolution.
