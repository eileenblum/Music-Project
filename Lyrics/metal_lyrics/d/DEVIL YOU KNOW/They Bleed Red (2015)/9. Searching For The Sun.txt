Looking from above, my words were not enough.
I can see you struggle from within and I've never been so wrong.

One more time, just one more time.
Walk this road, walk this road with me.
Mend the scars, I can mend the scars.
And I hope, I hope that you can see!

We're so much more than just tomorrow.
Let go of sorrow, I won't burn the bridge for tomorrow.

Searching for the sun, my heart was not enough.
Can't you see I struggle from within?

Forgiveness, forgiveness can't change.
What I've done, what I have done!
Mend the scars, but healing the old ways.
It begins, it has only just begun.

We're so much more than just tomorrow.
Let go of sorrow, I won't burn the bridge for tomorrow.
Let go of sorrow, we're so much more than tomorrow.

And I've never been so wrong.
And I've never been so wrong.

Animosity will grow, we're so much more than tomorrow.

Let go of sorrow, I won't burn the bridge for tomorrow.
Let go of sorrow, we're so much more...

So much more than tomorrow!
