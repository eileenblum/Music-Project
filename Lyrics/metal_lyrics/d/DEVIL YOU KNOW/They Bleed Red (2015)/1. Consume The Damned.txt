Bound to seduction, the bitter God that failed.
I gave my hopes and dreams to no avail.
Seek and never find, emptiness lies ahead.
Fascination upon the other side, so speaks the dead.

I'm living on borrowed time and I've been left behind.

You have it all, all that I want.
And I will claim it as my own.

For you I will consume the damned.
For you I will renounce the damned.

Renounce the damned.

I'm dying, there is no time.
A corpse is all that's left.
Cast out for you to find.

You have it all, all that I want.
And I will claim it as my own.

For you I will consume the damned.
For you I will renounce the damned.

Renounce the damned.
Renounce the damned.

For you I will consume the damned.
For you I will renounce the damned.
Life slips through my fingers like sand.
For you I will renounce the damned.

You have it all, all that I want.
And I will claim it as my own.

Seek and never find.
You have it all.
Emptiness lies ahead.
All that I want.
Fascination!
And I will claim it as my own!
So speaks the damned.

For you I will consume the damned.
For you I will renounce the damned.
Life slips through my fingers like sand.
For you I will renounce the damned.
