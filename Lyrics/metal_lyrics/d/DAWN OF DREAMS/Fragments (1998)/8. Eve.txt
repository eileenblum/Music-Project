Words cannot explain how I feel when I look into your eyes
When I hold you in my arms and feel the warmth of you
Nothing seems to matter when you're at my side although you're far away
The fire still burns in my heart
My life is like a puzzle and you are the part which makes it complete
When you come to me my heart begins to pound
I never had so strong feelings that I have for you
When you come just let me hold you 
for a second, for a minute, for an hour, forever, forever
