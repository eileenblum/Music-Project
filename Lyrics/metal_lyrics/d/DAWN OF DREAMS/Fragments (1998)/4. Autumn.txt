Now I feel like the whole year is gettin' to an end 
- like winter is only a dark and an empty space

Once warm, once cold is the freshest breeze of all, 
bringing me the news of the arriving winter

When leaves cover my mind and dance with the wind 
full of lust and happiness I feel sorrow

It let's me hope, that it passes soon 
...like winter is only a dark and an empty space
