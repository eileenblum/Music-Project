I am living in a dream, far away from reality
When my eyes are dearly closed, when the sun sets for evermore
Imprisoned in a blackened mind I cannot see any form of life
But I don't feel alone, 'cause you are at my side
Dreams - scars in the night
Dead birds sing their songs
Nothing but silence - and I still feel this scarlet passion
Never leave me bleeding in my peaceful dreamland
Only the thoughts resist, leading us into another world
This is my home, to where I'll always return to
Just when my life it ends - I know this dream will become true
