'cause I lost...

I can't find a way back out
I can't find a love to shroud
I can't find a thing about
I can't find what's going round

there's no law I'm under
there's no god to whom I pray
there's no pain - lets me bleed
that's my life, that's my way

I don't want this again
no, no more time to be
please leave me alone to be
please leave me alone to be
