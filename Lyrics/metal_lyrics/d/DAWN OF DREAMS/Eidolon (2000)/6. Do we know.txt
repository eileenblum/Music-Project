Here, we're standing calm - and never speak
We will not talk - 'cause we're too weak
The words that harm - were never said
They'll never be - until we're dead

Do we know
And if we know
Do we dare to say
And if we said, 
Because we dared
Do we want to pay

All my thoughts are a graveyard
Surrounded by your whispering trees
They open more their leaves (to talk)
Than we've ever did
