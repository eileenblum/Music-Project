My wounds are growing deeper
As blood flows to the ground
I know it is over
But it still hurts...

I've lost my energy
Of being still alive
With every cut into my veins
I'm coming closer...

This seems to be my passion
Once again with a broken heart
There is no way back
Not for me and not for you

It's always the same for me
But where is my fault?
What have I done to this world
That it has to be this way?

Maybe there is a day
When I'll find the real one
But I don't believe it
No, I don't believe it
