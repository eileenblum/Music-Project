At your side - I never died
My Eidolon - so hold me tight
With trust in you my hope shall live
And bring me through my endless dream

Created of same blood and flesh
Drank your wine and ate you bread
On your cross you left me here
And filled my heart with darkest fear

I never hoped
I never did
I desired the endless sleep
Never lost my trust in hopes
That have grown within my heart

I always wished
My life would end - where...
...light and dark go hand in hand
How I'm scared 'bout what I intend
Please embrace me now forever

In my mind - I lived a lie
About a God - who held me tight
With trust in him my hope it died
And truth was burnt into my eyes.
