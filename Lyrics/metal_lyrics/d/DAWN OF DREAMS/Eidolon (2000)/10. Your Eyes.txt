I am the painter
the one who paints
your face so gold

I'm your believer
who changes your
sweet lies in truth

You are my one
and you'll always be
until we die

You are my sun
which shines so bright
above the sky

I will take you - where the moon is shining
I will treat you - like a golden sculpture
I will pray your words - every night
I will never turn - my back again

Be, be my one... and unveil... my darkest desires
My love and my passion... and my reason - to live
Be, be the one... and teach me... your prayers
My love and my passion... and my reason - to live
