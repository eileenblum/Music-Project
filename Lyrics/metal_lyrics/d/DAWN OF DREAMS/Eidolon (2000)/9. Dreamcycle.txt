As the days are passing on 
And the nights - it has no end
All the fears that kept inside
Another state of my insanity

Can't wake up although I try
Begging for the light of day
I want to scream but cannot cry
And all my dreams won't go away...

Lost inside a cycle of dreams
Transforming night into day
I try to grab the light 
But only darkness remains for me
