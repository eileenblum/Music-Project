so - we gaze - at the shores, at our souls
thoughts - they fly - up to sky, up to him

see the writing on the wall
watch a god pretend to fall
pull the stars all down to earth
die once more an then - rebirth

all the writing on the wall
watch a god pretend to fall
pull the stars all down to earth
die again and then once more

once more - we die and greet angels keen
leave a message to the past which will read
