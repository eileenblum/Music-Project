I am, I am
You die, We die

Softly spoken, heart caressed
Gently touched, - "Stay with me!"
Hear my voice - through the night
As I read your every word

Go and bless me
Go and heal me

And as we die - Our souls, they fly
Our hearts are one

Such a free mind - thoughts unfold
Sweetest angel - "Take me now!"
Velvet words - on which you lie
I'll lie near you - until we die

Go and bless me
Go and heal me

We weep and cry - Each day and night
Our souls unite
