Hear my cries...
The laughter of the butterflies
Fell silent in the sweet breeze
Of plague of clouds
The gates to eternity opened
And took her away from me
The desperate silent cries
Of her eyes made me helpless
A neverending pain

I stared at her until her body
Disappeared into nothingness
Her silent cries penetrated into me
And took away my heart
Nevermore shall I feel
Her warmth again
She went over the rainbow
Into the land of the golden flowers
Still her love will last forever

My dreams gave way to the sad reality
My bursting heart reverberated
In the echo of the black mountains
The loneliness of my existence became one

With the coldness of my heart
I opened my soul to insanity

Drowned in sadness and melancholy
Made me to the way
To wash myself in the waters of oblivion
The past should become my future
The eternal quest my destiny
Death my redemption
Lonely and abandoned I gazed at the moon
Despairing my own
Within a lake of tears...
