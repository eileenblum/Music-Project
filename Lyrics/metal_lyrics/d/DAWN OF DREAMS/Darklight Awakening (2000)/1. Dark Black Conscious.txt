Lost between the worlds
I walked beyond a million shadows
Searching for the keys
To open the secret seals of conscious

Suspended over endless grounds
I'm still searching
Crawling between dimensions
To free my spirit from these scathing visions

When will I see?
Behold the secrets

Suddenly I saw the portals
The secret gates of twilight embraced
Livid mirrors enveiled of clouds
Awaiting the time of their opening

Am I the one to open the gates?
Am I the one to see what is behind?

An unknown fear shattered me
As I walked into the liquid mirrors
Transcending the dimensional portals
To see what is behind

A gentle pain
A dark dream
Adrift within the streams of matter
This silence...

And so I closed my eyes forever
To float within the calm of this world
I sent my spirit on a journey
Through the spheres of time and space

Comsic secrets opened before me
A dark black conscious
A mental enlightenment
The bleeding of a future secret
The secret of a future bleeding.
