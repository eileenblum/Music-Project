And if I climbed up to the hill
Just to see another day
To feel the silent apparition
Clear minded in the stream
And if I walked up to the road
To heal the restless night myself
Like sand to slide
Upon the wastes of time
I felt your breath aside
I washed the tears away
The sun in my eyes

I could see... I could feel

The dawn to what I turned my hands
A bible in the sea
To watch the sunrise through the dream
A bible in the sea
I lie awake watched by the past
A bible in the sea

If I could feel... If I could see
I'd bless the hopes to cover me

The starry sky wide awakened
And the blessing was done
Shining angel
I sent the dream to come
And bleed another time
Harmony's seance at reality's end
I see...
