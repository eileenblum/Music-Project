"A glimpse at fading twilight
And cries no one can hear
Leaving dimensions waiting
For a coming time of fear"

Forced with the powers of magic
A soldier
Travelling the outer space of tomorrow
A warrior
Fighting for the survival of mankind

Through gates he stepped to search his eden
Facing demons everlost
A feast of flesh and evil desire
The greed of hate embodied in chaos

A bizarre world so strange and dark
A black scenery in unhearing silence

Raging hordes of red-eyed demons
Revealing the face of hell beneath
A shallow emptiness
Laid in fire

Bestial powers raise their claws
To tear the mortal flesh apart
Apocalyptic force
Curse of the mortal

Farewell my soul
Hell is calling.
