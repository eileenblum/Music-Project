When the last light is fading
And heaven is throned by a bloodred moon
When skies become black
Darkness gives birth to the night

Ghosts and demons unify to conquer
To create a new dark empire
They march for the last battle
To invoke the infinity of the night

Witches charm the human victims
Sucking out their lives with passionate kisses
Seduce them with unnatural beauty
To dance with their corpses
Suspended above the flames

Ecstatic dancing flames
From the inner heart of fire
Gently embrace the mortal flesh

Shadows rise from beyond the light
Slowly enveloping the blue of the sky
A resurrection of darkest dreams
For an everlasting time of darkness

Now all light has faded
And heaven is throned by a bloodred moon
Skies became black
Night is born.
