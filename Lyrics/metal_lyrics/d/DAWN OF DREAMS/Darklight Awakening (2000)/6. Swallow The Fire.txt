As darkness cast its shadows
Over the last dreams of the setting sun
Shadows arise
Awakened by the night's sweet kisses

Swallow the fire breed of the night
Descend upon the land of light
For silence will rule
In this nightly landscape

Crawling flames
From beyond the light of heaven
Chant the melody of devastation

Forlorn without a shape
Dissolved to dust
Desperate screams
Erased by furious winds

Covered in darkness
From behind the black
Lightless visions
Where souls hide before

Swallow the fire breed of the night
Descend upon the land of night
For silence will rule
Eternally.
