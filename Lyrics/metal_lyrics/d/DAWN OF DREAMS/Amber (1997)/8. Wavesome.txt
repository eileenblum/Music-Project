Thousand miles away from home
I offer myself to the sea
What have I done in the past?
Why can't you help me now?

My body is a part of the waves
My mind is the warm white dans
When the sun sets over hte horizon
I am a part of the sea

Like a fish I swim through the cascades
And look for the tiny pearls
As my body glides into the abyss
I can't resist the pressure

Lost in the dark spheres of the ocean
I can't find the way back home
Nobody can help me now
Because I am the wavesome
