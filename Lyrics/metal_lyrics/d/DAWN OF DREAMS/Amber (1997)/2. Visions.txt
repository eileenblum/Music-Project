When the sun is rolling
Over the horizon
That I can almost touch it
I reach out my hand for the light
That lets my heart chant

I have the feeling Like being torn apart
When my pleasure and desire meet
Cries crawl up my throat, but
My mind tells met to swallow

Let me enjoy these moments
Until the last second is gone
Until the clouds have com
Cause they'll take it all away

This sweet passion that you feed
What tenderness a mind can feel
Each time you hit a nail
Into my hand
I want to beg for another
