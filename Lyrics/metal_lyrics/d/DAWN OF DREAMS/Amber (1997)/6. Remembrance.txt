Remind me of the old times
Just tell me stories about 'em
I did not forget your name
Beware me of makin' this mistake again!

I live here in my grave
I never died in this well
Dont's leave me remembrance!
My thoughts are made of you

Oh, my heart is bleeding
No, can you forgive me?
Don't you see my wound
...will never heal - you keep me seeking

Sadness covers my life
'Cause you know me - know where it hurts
But I will never forget you
I will always forgive you
