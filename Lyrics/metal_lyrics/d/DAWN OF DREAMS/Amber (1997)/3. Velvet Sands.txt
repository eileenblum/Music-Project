I lay down my head in deepest sorrow
And feel the emptiness of my soul
NOthing is left but your image
A fading picture is my blackened mind

A black swan dies an it's tears
Get dried from the dust
So only the crimson skies
Can wathc the end of this tragedy

Withing this darkened firmament
The silent moon
He sees my fall, my grief
The waves wash away the blood
So that nothing remains of this
Unknown lovelorn fate
