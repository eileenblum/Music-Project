The clouds are colored orange
By street-lamps and hope
Swirling upwards to the
Silent - cloudy - dreamy sky

'cause when I die
I reach out to the stars

and when I cry
while looking at my past

my mother sighs
she buries me so deep

deep in my heart
so let me stay and sleep

I'm reaching out for hope
Not for love - 'cause there's no more
My parents are standing by my grave
Finally a place where I fell save
