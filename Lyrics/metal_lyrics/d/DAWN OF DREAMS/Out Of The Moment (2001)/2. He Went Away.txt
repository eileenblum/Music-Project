He went away
With his footsteps in wax
He is gone

Ticking away
He took the time
At the end of the universe
With bread and wine
With bread and wine

He went away
And took the light
Of a fading candle
He took it away

With his footsteps caught in wax
And his fingerprints
On the table in the wine
Where he left his steps
And his face an the dishes
Where he left
Where he left us
Where he left us dying - now!
