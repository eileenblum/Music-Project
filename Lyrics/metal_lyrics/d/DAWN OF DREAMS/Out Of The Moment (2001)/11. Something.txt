[lyrics by Jenny Almgren]
[used by kind permission]

Something in the air has made me blind
Blind for all the things in life

Something in my mind has made me cold
Cold when the sun is burning hot

Something in my life has left me on my own
Begging on my knees that my worship shall die with me

Something that you said has made me almost dead
Tell me...
