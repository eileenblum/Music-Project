In the sky - where my words are written
I want to read - I want to write
Poems for you - where noone can read them
Songs for you - that noone can hear

Beneath the sun - where the earth is burning
I want to be - I want to die
For you my dear - where our love is glowing
Under the sky - where my thoughts are living
