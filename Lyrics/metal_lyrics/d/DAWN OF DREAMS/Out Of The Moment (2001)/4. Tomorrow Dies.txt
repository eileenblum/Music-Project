Glowing segment of the sun
Rising higher in our hearts
Facing our harmless wish
To hold tomorrow every day

Tomorrow dies, tomorrow dies
In our hands, in our sighs

Wishing night will never come
Catching light in every breath
The will to live, the will to take
A step further, to make the way

Tomorrow dies, tomorrow dies
In our hands, in our eyes
