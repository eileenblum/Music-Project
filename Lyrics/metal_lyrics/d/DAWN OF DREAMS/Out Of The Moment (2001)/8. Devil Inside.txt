Fly, flying high
Risin' upwards to the sky
Will you kill the angels
And greet the devils?

Try to threat all dead
To become immortal
Will you seek resurrection?

When you feel all unreal
Have no secrets to unveil
And to seal

Never fought the sane
Will you go insane
If you were a real devil...

I never thought that I could be
The only devil inside me
Take my kiss and then take me
In the final moment you will see
