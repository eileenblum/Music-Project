Nina wake up!
The sun went down
The waves became calm
And birds flew home

Nina come on
The night's on its way
We need join her
`Cause she doesn't wait

So, we dance - tonight
And we are here to stay
Together all alone
With passion on our way

We eat the light tonight
We only fear the day
Because when we wake up
The dancers go away
