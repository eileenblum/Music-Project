A drop of time
Frozen in the moment
A moment frozen in ice
A piece of life kept in time

A second for a lifetime
A life for a day
And if I'd say:
"I'll exchange my life for a prayer!"

I don't cease the day
I feel life, its pureness
Without shadows

Unveiled from darkness
Exposed to life
A drop of time
Exposed to life

Eternity's tear I can see
The endless breath
I see your face
It touches my heart
Like a mother her own child
