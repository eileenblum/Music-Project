Along time ago was this stone circle built
The reason behind it remains a mystery

Why was it built at end of all paths?
On a tiny glade where no one could find

I wondered what was the purpose of this strange cult
To quench the thirst of my curiosity I decided to step in

The very moment I put my feet inside
I lost my consciousness, my sense of reality
It was another world I ended up in
Somewhere far from ours

I flew through a tunnel where voices
Were calling my name enchantingly
Flashes of nightmareous visions
A man of god would say I was in hell

Suddenly I found myself in a void
Empty of matter empty of noise
A while I didn't know if I still was flying
Until it began again
It was as sudden when I got back to my reality
Supposedly after rolling out of the circle in the dream
I immediately knew that my knowledge wasn't enough
To research and possess this secret

When I walked away I stopped on a little hill
I saw it again, now also its shape...a five-pointed star
