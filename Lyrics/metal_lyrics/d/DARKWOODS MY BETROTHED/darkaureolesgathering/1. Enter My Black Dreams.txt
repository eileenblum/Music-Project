dark red blood colours me
a thick black cloud lies over
blood rains down from an angel's cunt
I drink the liquid of power

entering my black dreams
a world without borders
where whores suck my flesh
and where my evil thoughts unite

to the north I see an icy mirror
reflections so deep blue
so I look straight into it
and I see my own god

the angel is crucified
with cold silvery nails
raped with two goathorns
the black and the unnamed

it's the dawn of the sixth june
temples of christ burn bright
I fly in the deepest blackness
my inner hell my light...
