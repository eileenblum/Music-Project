lead me through the night
blackness... the void covers me
a dream of fullmoon... the light
up through the sky I fly
where are you now?
the beauty of darkness
holocaust... blood for thy soul
I'll carry you through the void

was it yesterday?
a day seems to be like a century
take your revenge
through my sword of evil

a part of me died with you
it burns in my very heart
thy whispers... lead me in cosmos
for thee I'll shed my blood
I raise my sword into the air
you'll soon have holy blood
your thirst will be quenched
revenge... blood of feeble dogs

my insatiable lust
take my blood... I'll join you
I can hear thy calls from shadows
blood flows out of my veins...
soon I'll be there too
