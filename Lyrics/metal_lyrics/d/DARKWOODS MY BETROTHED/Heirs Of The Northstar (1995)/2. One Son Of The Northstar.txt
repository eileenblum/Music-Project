One endless cold star
Here I stand... following
Thy dark spirit... thy faint light
A path across my dreams
Take me far... into the unknown fly
Over a desert... a snowfield
...and dancing woods
I storm the nocturnal sky
In the fiery chariots I ride...

My dreams are like thy rays...
I see them sink into the sands of time
...and fade...

My spirit is like thine...
Shows only its nightside
Always strong and faithful
...and never fails...

These snowy woods, this frozen land
Here I stand... waiting
For thee to come... to show thy face
Over this land
Once heathen... once proud
In the icestorms
Of the cold northern winter
In the snowy hills and dark woods
My heart is forged
And that ice will never melt...
