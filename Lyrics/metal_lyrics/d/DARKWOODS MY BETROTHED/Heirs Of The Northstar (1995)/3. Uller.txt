Amongst the cold
Northern mountains
He travells...
Wrapped in furs
And armed with a bow
He is the god of winter

Hear me Uller!
Ride by me
In the battles... and cover me
With thy mighty shield
O god of winter

Born of mother Sif
The stepson of thor
In the cold winter lies his realm
To the vale of Ydalir
His footsteps lead
There he dwells
The god of winter
