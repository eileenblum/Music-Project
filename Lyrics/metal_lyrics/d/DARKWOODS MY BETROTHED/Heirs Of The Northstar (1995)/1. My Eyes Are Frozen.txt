Rape us the time
You bring us this loving wave
Crosses they rose
On our once proud pagan land

Those words they spoke were like
Needles on my skin
And their blessings were like knives
Stabbed into my heart

I trusted thee
O heathen men of the north
To hail and fight
And to run them out

Those words they listened were like
Stabs into my back
The baptism they had meant
That I had lost homeland

Cold winds now freeze my eyes

...Now I flee
Out of this shame they caused
I spread my wings
To fly to a realm of my own

My eyes are frozen for the icy tears
My soul sheds
For those betrayers that were not
Strong enough in faith
