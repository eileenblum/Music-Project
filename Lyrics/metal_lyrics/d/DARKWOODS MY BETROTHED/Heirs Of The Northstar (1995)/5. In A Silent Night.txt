Sitting under a pine
The deep silence... unbroken around
One dark lake
So placid, so cold...

Descended night
Throws shadows over water
Brown leaves fly
Autumn is turning into winter

What happens around me?
It has no meaning...
I sleep in my woe
This is not my world...
For my world lies
Beyond other's reach

Shadows dancing - my throne
My dreams' winterland I behold
Through the gates of time unseen
In a silent night

Somewhere deep inside
In the darkest woods
In the darkest nights
Lies my ancient realm
Where are still places
For me to find

Shadows dancing - my throne
My dreams' winterland I behold
Through the gates of time unseen
In a silent night
