In the midst of the dead earth up through the clouds they rise
Feet sunk in moss heads covered in a veil of white
Kings born and die but fells still watch up proud
Like giants in their grandeur they stand and hold the sky

Shadows grow tall covering the barren earth
The earth that wears only lichen and moss
The sun is setting and the sky dresses in red
for the coming six fullmoons all light will be lost

The daylight goes hiding into infinity
The last shades of red turn slowly to gray
...and then to black
On some nights will the northern lights appear
And send their rays to reflect from the snow
Colouring the lands of fells in all their shades
When they disappear... only darkness remains
