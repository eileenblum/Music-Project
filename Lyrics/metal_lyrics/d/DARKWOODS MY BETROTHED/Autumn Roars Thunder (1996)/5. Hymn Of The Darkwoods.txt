Up from the North we come
From the land of a thousand lakes
A heathen force from the once proud Northland
Where pines are covered with snowflakes

Pagan warriors, hear our battlehymn
Help our words soar high
Thou shall be greeted with our mighty hail
Our star is on rise!

Break the chains of enslavement
Time will come for the enslavers to pay
One winter solstice we shall gather together
And it will be their doomsday!

Pagan warriors, hear our battlehymn
Help our words soar high
Thou shall be greeted with our mighty hail
Our star is on rise!

Our star is now dim
But getting brighter
It will replace the enslaver sun
Hear us, brothers and sisters
A new day is dawning
Upon us heirs of the Northstar

Pagan warriors, hear our battlehymn
Help our words soar high
Thou shall be greeted with our mighty hail
Our star is on rise!
