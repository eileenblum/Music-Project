He wandered through landscapes painted
Green by forests and blue by lakes
All the way of leagues ten and five
Until he arrived during the fall of twilight

Gathered the villagers around him
To hear the sad news he had to bring
"Three dawns ago in the land towards sunrise
Was thy king slain in a battle at night"

A gray cloud shadowed the hearts of men
And flowing tears wet women's eyes
Their king had gone to Tuonela
Had his spirit among them died?
Had it gone away with the flames
That burned his warship - his grave
The nightwinds had called his name
The gods got another man brave

Weeks after the funeral was seen a shadow gray
Roaming in the woods of the eastern land

Hiding in daytime then returning at night
Haunting in the minds of the mortals who killed a king
