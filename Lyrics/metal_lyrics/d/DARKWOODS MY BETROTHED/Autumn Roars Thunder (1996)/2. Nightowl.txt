Two eyes in darkness like two burning fires
Still cold as a wintery lake
The moon is hidden behind dark clouds
Fluttering wings... the silence breaks

I was walking on the edge of the forest
When the eyes began to approach
A while I just stood there watching
The eyes coming close

The owl she came onto my arm
Her eyes starring deep into me
Soon a shroud covered my eyes
I could hear but I couldn't see

"The time is close, o men of Karelia
Men of pride, the time is near
Soon thou will see a new god coming
When snow falls he will be here

Centuries to come will see his dominion
His dominion that makes thee slaves
Have not fear, it won't last forever
The new dawn will hail thy father' gods again"

At the very moment the last word was gone
Returned my sight
I saw no owl only heard a silent flutter
From Tapio's realm, from the fading night

As I walked away I thought:
"It can't be true that a northern man
Would lose his honour and be a slave
Of a god from an unknown land......."
