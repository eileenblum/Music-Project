Heighten Your Soul
Above The Caress Of Emptiness
Keeping Your Run
Without Meaning Of Return
Through The Dust
And Through The Blood
I've Strengthened My Hold On And On
Far From Their Grace
Unlit By Anger
I'm Carrying On

Fall Destiny Fall! Into My Hands
From The Depths Of The Unknown
Just Let Me Believe That
I'm Leading My Life On My Own
Trapped Within The Spires Of Thy Storm

My True Desire
Is Only To Ride This Mortal Coil
And Step Aside
From The Wishes Of Mankind
To Free All My Inner-Self
And Lay On The Earth To Rest

Then As My Corpse Will Be Withered
You Will Realize Our True Nature
Then As My Corpse Will Be Withered
Will You Behold What We Are Seeking For?

Fall Destiny Fall! Into My Hands
From The Depths Of The Unknown
Just Let Me Believe That
I'm Leading My Life On My Own
Trapped Within The Spires Of Thy Storm

Beneath A Crystal Sky We Are Trying
To Give A Positive Sense To Life
But It Isn't For The Pain And Night
That We Crave For The Love And Light?
We Crave For The Love And Light?

Nothing To Miss, I've Nothing To Fear
For My Intentions And Creed
Never Again I'll Bleed For Some Pain
And Bury Myself In My Self-Made Coffin
Nothing To Miss, I've Nothing To Fear
For My Intentions And Creed
Never Again I'll Bleed For Some Pain
And Bury Myself Under The Veils Of False Misery
