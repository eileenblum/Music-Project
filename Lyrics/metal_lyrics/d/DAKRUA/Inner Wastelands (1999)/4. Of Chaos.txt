Entropy In All I See
It's Just My Reality, But Think:
What's Behind This Pointless Game?
What's Behind All Our Despair?

Will The End Of This Life
Show The Real Prize
I'm Waiting For?
Although I'm Carrying My Cross
I Cannot See
No Sign Of Hope
... Breeding The Chaos To Live...

On And On With False Beliefs
Hate The Creed That Leads Our Lives And Deeds
Once Again We'll Put Our Love
In The Fear That We Call God

Will The End Of This Life
Show The Real Prize
I'm Waiting For?
Although I'm Carrying My Cross
I Cannot See
No Sign Of Hope
... No...

The Blind Leads The Blind
Show To Me What You See
With Chains Of Deceit
Show To Me I Can't See
As Death Is The Only Truth
... In The Chaos...

Wandering The Chaos Path
My Delight And Curse
I Can't See The Destiny
With His Marble Laws...
