Wake Up To A New Morning
What's That Keeps Us All From Falling?
When This Sense Of Nothingness
Comes To Shade All Lights Of Black
Comes To Shade All Lights Of A Black Meaning
And Crush The Will Of Those Who Try And Never Win

Bleeding, Bleeding, What We Do Is Never Enough
Trying, Trying, What We Do Is Never Enough

And My Life Reflects This Scheme
In Each Frame, In Every Blame
The Sweetest Words Of Those You Trust
Are Poisoned Lies That Break The Heart

Watch The Sunset Of Your Age
Feeling Trapped In A Cage
All Your Hopes Are Flying Away
And There's No kind Of God To Pray
There's No kind Of God To Pray Or Hate
Screams Of Rage Are The Only Things Left To You

Bleeding, Bleeding, What We Do Is Never Enough
Trying, Trying, What We Do Is Never Enough

And My Life Reflects This Scheme
In Each Frame, In Every Blame
The Sweetest Words Of Those You Trust
Are Poisoned Lies That Break The Heart
