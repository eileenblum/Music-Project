Alone In The Shroud Of Darkness
I Can See My Bright Eyes In A Mirror
Now I Can't Find My Star In The Night
And My Eyes Are Dreaming A Lie...
Die With Your Sorrow
In This Land You Get Rid Of Your Pain
Floating Forever
Without Anger, Without Desire

I Can't Touch Her With My Fingers
Cause She's Closed In My Mind
I Can't Touch Her With My Fingers
But I'm Waiting For Another Life

Now I Am Waiting For Death
Death The Only Way
The Only Way To Open New Dreams
And So Bury Me Deep

I Can't Touch Her With My Fingers
Cause She's Closed In My Mind
I Can't Touch Her With My Fingers
But I'm Waiting For Another Life

If You Want Arrive To Your Heaven
You Have To Plunge Yourself In This Bloody River...
... And To Wash Away Your Sins

Follow Me And I'll Show You The Path To Safety
No I Can't, Here I'm A Prisoner
Oh, My Son,
Close Your Eyes And Take My Hand
I'll Spare You Of Your Appalling Trial

Amor, Vita, Mors - Amor, Vita, Mors
Amor, Vita, Mors - Amor, Vita, Mors
Amor, Vita, Mors - Amor, Vita, Mors

Alone In The Shroud Of Darkness
I Can See My Bright Eyes In A Mirror
Now I Can't Find My Star In The Night
And My Eyes Are Dreaming A Lie...
