We Will Soar Into The Void
Laughing About Our Past Lives
Thinking About The Unreachable Things
We've Not Got We Will Flee From A Night
That Was Too Much Eager
To Own, Love And Destroy us

In A Mist Darker Than Light
The Day After We Will Recognize
Our Shapes In A Thousand Shards
Of Shattered Mirrors, Senseless Creatures
In A Dragon's Dream
We Will Open Our Arms To Embrace Gea
And The Black God Of
And The Black God Of The Sun
Our Father...

Only To Find That We Are
Eternally Dead, Dead
