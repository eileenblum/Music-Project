Lost In Shades Of Myself
I Can't Find The Way
To Reach Out For The One
That Holds Your Flame
Scared By Thy Hand
Caress Me
In Your Arms
I'll Be Free

So Take Me Away Into Your Flames
To Ease My Pain...
Drowning In Black Shining Days
Of Forgotten Realms
I'm Drinking The Waters
Of Lethe's Stream

What Will Remain Of Your Dreams?
Nothing Else Than A Silent Scream
Scream...
So Take Me Away Into Your Flames
To Ease My Pain...
... The Solitude

Scream...
So Take Me Away Into Your Flames
To Ease My Pain...
