Sail Your Way
To The Glowing Sun Ablaze
In The Warmth Of The Day
But Through All This Violent Storm
Will I Keep Myself Strong?
On And On To The Sun...

As The Red Morning Comes We'll Dance
Like Dead Leaves On The Wind

Find Your Way To My Frozen Heart
In A Cold Winter Reign
With A Thousand Scars In My Soul
I Will Keep Myself Strong
On And On To The Sun...

As The Red Morning Comes We'll Dance
Like Dead Leaves On The Wind
Like Dead Leaves On The Wind
Like Dead Leaves On The Wind
