Come here, I'm gonna tell you how this will end.
Come here, I'm gonna drag you down this descend

Guns go off and acid rains
Down the face of this town.

Blood and dirt and dirty
Blood money, and
Explosive sound.

The whole ground cracks
from the oil and the blood
on the tracks because.
All the devils toys
(Now you're gonna see them)
when I bring you this
All the devils toys
(Now you're gonna hear their cries)

Listen, I'm gonna take
you to where it starts.

Listen, I'm gonna lead
You to the dead at heart.

Charlatans ride and liberties
Run and the doll house wins.

Cause of burning your citizens
Crawl and the mercury Drains

The whole ground cracks
from the oil and the blood
on the tracks because,
all the devils toys
(Now you're gonna see them)
when I bring you this
All the devils toys
(Now you're gonna hear their cries)

Taste devils Kiss

All these conscious eyes
Some secrets of gold.

And the weary strike eyes
It's shock, it's blood,
It's used and it'sâ¦

Can you hear his voice?
It's sounds from vengeance
Can you hear the noise?
It is enough up here.

Death face will break
your fists if you try to resist.
Death face will break
your fists if you try to resist

All the devils Toys.
Not you're gonna see them
when I bring you this
All the devils toys
Now you're gonna hear their cries

All the devils Toys

All the devils joys

All the devils Toys

All the devils joys

Come to get the blackest bliss
