All bones are broken and we lie here on the floor
The rats are coming, they smell us, they need some more
We must pursuit this virus in the clinics of chains
We crawl on ripped joints with fever in Mephisto's back lanes

I know you feel it - you want it
More and more and more...

Track, crush and prevail
Now come, let's hunt for ersatz souls
Track, crush and prevail
Watch the blood turn your diamonds into coal

The science of darkness and we practice all its codes
Their values turn, they guide us on titanium roads
We must reduce ourselves in surgeries grace
We amputate our parts and let prosthetics replace

I know you feel it - you want it
More and more and more...

Track, crush and prevail
Now come, let's hunt for ersatz souls
Track, crush and prevail
Watch the blood turn your diamonds into coal

Grab the claws - take my hand
Serve the cause - take command
I will show you my plan

Cut the ropes - come as free
Here's the gate - turn the key
I will let you be grand

Track, crush and prevail
Now come, let's hunt for ersatz souls
Track, crush and prevail
Watch the blood turn your diamonds into coal

Track, crush and prevail
Track, crush and prevail
This is your fall
Track, crush and prevail
The devil pays cash when your soul is on sale
