They're dying in the woods, a breed that's scarred from dirty goods
They search for their kind
Desperate eyes in silver skin, the poison glides in veins of tin
They search for their time

The grounds are filled with razors and snow, the people flee and the insects glow
They are coming for you
Sleep in the fields, earthly dolls, the woods are burning and the cities fall
And the rivers defile

You will cover their needs, they will crush all your creeds
We are the servants and we worship their deeds

All their diamond claws
And their golden jaws
Earth's all living things grow asphalt wings

They hide in the hills, a new breed moves with human skills
They want to be free
Watch their nature rust to red, snakes are crawling in virgins' beds
Their spawn will now see

The trees are torn from the rain and roar, the buildings fall into the city's floor
It will never end
Flocks are hunted on concrete plains, the scythe is there and it's counting names
And you will descend

You will cover their needs, they will crush all your creeds
We are the servants and we worship their deeds

All their diamond claws
And their golden jaws
Earth's all living things grow asphalt wings

You will cover their needs, they will crush all your creeds
We are the servants and we worship their deeds

All their diamond claws
And their golden jaws
Earth's all living things grow asphalt wings
