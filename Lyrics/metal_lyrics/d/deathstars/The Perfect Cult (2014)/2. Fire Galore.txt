It hunts and it preys and it's black and it's cold
But there's a diamond in the dark
Just like you've been told
So you start to dig for the gold

The flag burns in red and fill the city with ice
His diamonds are forever like virginity's lies
First the ghost resign, then they rise

It will rise through you, it will destroy you
To strike hard from its burning core

Well, it's cold and pure
Feed the flames to score
Like you've seen it before
(More and more and more)
Burn, the fire galore

You turn to return to where the churches burned
But the asphalt cracks open and inferno there churns
When you try to give up, then you learn

The northern vamps writhe on well designed nails
And life rides on dope when all else fails
So you start to walk, the burning trails

It will rise through you, it will destroy you
To strike hard from its burning core

Well, it's cold and pure
Feed the flames to score
Like you've seen it before
(More and more and more)
Burn, the fire galore

It hunts and it preys and it's black and it's cold
But there's a diamond in the dark
Just like you've been told
So you start to dig for the gold

The northern vamps writhe on well designed nails
And life rides on dope when all else fails
So you start to walk, the burning trails

To strike hard from its burning core

Well, it's cold and pure
Feed the flames to score
Like you've seen it before
(More and more and more)
Burn, the fire galore

Well, it's cold and pure
Feed the flames to score
Like you've seen it before
Burn, the fire galore
