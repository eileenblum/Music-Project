Stop, and bow down
Let your bodies be sold to clones
Stop, and count down
Trapped in the wreckage of your own bones

A cigarette between dead lips
And your tiny hands on skeletal hips
Coil, you snakes
What happens here will seal your fate

Turn your future into dust
Fall, sole survivor
Sell your life for death and rust
Rise, ghost reviver

Strip, and walk free
Bathe in blood from a thousand young
Strip, and you'll be
Just another psalm that won't be sung

The silhouette before the shock
And your eyes bleed on black diamond rocks
Coil, you snakes
What happens here will seal your fate

Turn your future into dust
Fall, sole survivor
Sell your life for death and rust
Rise, ghost reviver

Shot with the lead from the barrel of your dreams
Guns have an interesting voice
Shot with the lead from the barrel of your fears
Guns make such interesting noise

Turn your future into dust
Fall, sole survivor
Sell your life for death and rust
Rise, ghost reviver
