The lips are red and the mouth is dead, dear
The valium shows, the feast will soon attract the crows

The light won't reach where the darkness preaches
My tongue is near, just lick it - feel no fear

Come, come, come 
Time to grab the gun
Come - we'll get this done

Noise cuts
Stabs the darkest, sickest parts of you
White noise cuts through

The eyes are dead and the grounds are red here
The marrows break, the saints will never stop to shake

No bliss will find what your demons can bind
My world is here, just enter - shed no tear

Come, come, come 
Time to grab the gun
Come - we'll get this done

Noise cuts
Stabs the darkest, sickest part of you
White noise cuts through

Noise cuts
It carves like razors in me too
Black noise haunts you

We shall all be discarded, we shall all despair
We shall all be departed and none will care

We are the last things you will see
In the violence, in the Devil's lair
And the scarabs will eat you clean
In the silence, in the thin black air

Noise cuts
Stabs the darkest, sickest part of you
White noise cuts through

Noise cuts
It carves like razors in me too
Black noise haunts you

Come, come, come
Time to grab the gun
Come, come, come
The hunt has just begun
Come - we'll get this done
