March in - take command
Line up - take a stand
Make this war to art

Strike fast - start the hunt
Gear up - to the front
Let the fire start

Soldiers - as you were
Shadows - as you were
We'll soon march in affect
Ammo - bring it in
Weapons - make'em sing
We'll now attack to protect

EXPLODE
Flip the switch
RELOAD
Trigger it
We will scorch the earth
EXPLODE
Let it sound
RELOAD
Another round
It will be our rebirth
EUROTOPIA

Patrol - punish man
Strike hard - burn the land
It's a ravished scene

Now aim - head and heart
Untame - tear apart
Hear their perfect screams

Soldiers - as you were
Shadows - as you were
We'll soon march in affect
Ammo - bring it in
Weapons - make'em sing
We'll now attack to protect

EXPLODE
Flip the switch
RELOAD
Trigger it
We will scorch the earth
EXPLODE
Let it sound
RELOAD
Another round
It will be our rebirth
EUROTOPIA

When the world here turns
And the flags there burn
Then I stand by my grounds
And all the roads that we try
We set aflame to the sky
And I stand by my grounds

When the white eyes dream
And the ruins gleam
BURN YOUR LITTLE FAITHS
AT THE IRON STAKES

You will evolve
When the masses dissolve

EXPLODE
Flip the switch
RELOAD
Trigger it
We will scorch the earth
EXPLODE
Let it sound
RELOAD
Another round
It will be our rebirth
EUROTOPIA
