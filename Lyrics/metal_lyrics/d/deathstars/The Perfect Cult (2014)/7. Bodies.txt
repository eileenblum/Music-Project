Steal their bodies but leave their faces
Carry their wings to the lord of flies

Burn these towns, crush their game
The patients smell of medicines and rain
Can you see - they look for you

Cut the stars, turn the knife
Let death walk tall in the shattered shape of life
Can you hear - they search for you

This is the nail that injects the hurt
A graffiti of blood that stains the dirt

Bodies
Bodies
I'll undress you to the core of your bones
Bodies
Bodies
Reanimate mankind from that what is torn

This is our world
This is your peace
Our strength and our disease

Collect their names then bury them deep
Empty their lungs and inhale the air

Lick their teeth, split your tongue
Give birth to noise from punctured lungs
Can you break the light in their eyes

Fingers break, lips are ripped
Skin cracks open, spines get whipped
Can you unbury that what here lies

This is the nail that injects the hurt
A graffiti of blood that stains the dirt

Bodies
Bodies
I'll undress you to the core of your bones
Bodies
Bodies
Reanimate mankind from that what is torn

Steal their bodies but leave their faces
Carry their wings to the lord of flies

This is our world
This is your peace
Our strength and our disease

These are the wills
Narcotics and filth
And the bodies of snakes and man
