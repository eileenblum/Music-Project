The barrel looked her deep in the eye and she said;
"I want you..."
She looked the gun deep in the eye, the gun said;
"I want you too..."

Doom strikes the tame day
Day with a bowie in your bed
Bodies in a huge ashtray
Your life spells D.E.A.D!

Well, the D is for destroy (Under the gun)
The E is for enforce (Under the gun)
A is for absolute (Under the gun)
And D is for darkness
"DEAD!" (Mark of the gun)

The razor smiled at the pale wrist
The wrist said;
"Let me smile for you..."
The razor kissed to open the skin and then said;
"Now you're smiling too..."

I control you with my hand
The reasons you retrieved
Damn the deeds you did, my friend
The panic of this eve!

Well, the D is for destroy (Under the gun)
The E is for enforce (Under the gun)
A is for absolute (Under the gun)
And D is for darkness
"DEAD!" (Mark of the gun)

But did you ever see that, the crimes you did were alright
But will you ever taste that, the certain wet taste of fright

Well, the D is for destroy (Under the gun)
The E is for enforce (Under the gun)
A is for absolute (Under the gun)
And D is for darkness
"DEAD!" (Mark of the gun)

D...
E... (The mark of the gun)
A...
D...
