I lit my scars in a new cigarette's light
The heart crawls to meet the shock
As the tender steel hits the naked skin
So life has first begun when death wins
It is so deep
It is so cold
It is so sharp
It is for foretold
I cast the dust into the path to really see
The bonds of my blood turn so cold
All the childhood's memories scream inside of me
The pain for this world sets the other free
It is so deep
It is so cold
When the colors blend to black
It is so sharp
It is foretold
Via the end
The loneliness won't leave me alone
Summer infernal paradisial hell
The sheer absence is the only presence
I understand now the toll of the bell
