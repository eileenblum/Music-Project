I let the flames lick your skin
It takes like fever
And candy and tin
I let the fire explode and then win
So the end begins!
Child of light
Let my hand carry you along
Child of light
Your mother's milk is long gone
But will they ever come back to us
Those who were buried in the golden
Dust
They will never back to us
Light!
The fuel ignites
Never let you back tonight
Fight!
The fuel for frights
I knew that you would die this way
Torn apart torn on a pale summerday
I knew that you would end up as prey
Innocence must pay!
Trash of night
Celebrate all that is gone
Trash of night
And the air fills broken songs
But will they ever come back to us
Buried in the golden dust
They will never
Let you back tonight
Light!
The fuel ignites
Never let you back tonight
Fight!
The fuel for fright
Feed the rage
Feed the lies
Line up the victims
Under ravishing skies
Feel the rage
Feel the lies
See through the flames
That dance in my eyes
