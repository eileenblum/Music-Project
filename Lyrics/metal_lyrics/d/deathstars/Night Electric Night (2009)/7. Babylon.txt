Say what you want me to do
And I will do it for you
Say who you want me to do
And I'll do her too
And in the backstreets
All the demons
Laugh as hell -
They want some more.
Dobermans raising Cain
In this lovely game --
And you wait to score
They come in lines
To welcome you
They're shining through...
... Babylon
And the sights
Will pierce your eyes
Babylon
When nightmares
On both sides
Babylon
Watch how I strangle this
It is the infamous kiss
Watch when I lick your fists
I'll give 'em endless bliss
And the baby avatars
Invites me
With their nymphlike lips
Blackish uniformed shaped
On stolen tapes
Private hardcore flicks
They come in lines to welcome you
They're shining through...
... Babylon
And the sights
Will pierce your eyes
Babylon
When nightmares
On both sides
Babylon
Hold these hounds now
I want you to see
The thousand ways
That lead to terror
Hold these hounds now
I want you to feel
The endless grounds
That are from horror
They come in lines
To welcome you
They're shining through...
The human nakedness rides-
On the back of hell
The virgins sex up their lives-
And I wish you well
