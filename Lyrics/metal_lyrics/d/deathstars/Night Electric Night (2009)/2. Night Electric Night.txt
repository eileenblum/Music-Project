It's Night...

Night...

When the night just strikes through you
And the night just spreads its legs and open up for you
When the day is dead to you
And the silvery starlight seductively glimmers through

It's Night...
Night!

When the night just comes for you
And its fingers just crawl and move deep inside of you
When the light is drawn from you
And you sear your lips and let the sweet poison come on through

It's Night
Night Electric Night

The world lies silent
The night burns of wrath

When the night just craves for you
And the white is gone and the black has taken you
When the night just scratch on you
And its tongue paints the sky and comes to lick you too

It's Night
Night Electric Night

The world lies silent
The night burns of wrath
The day is sleeping
The blackmarked make their path
