Can you see them coming
From the valleys and hills
They finally got you
Can you see them staring
As the rain hits your palms
They are here to gut you

Can you here them speak your name
They shout it out
So the storm can come through
Can you hear them celebrate
That they found you
Their knives will slip through

I know... I know... That you can...

Zeitgeist
Wow wow -- Darkness kingsized!
Zeitgeist
Opium
Zeitgeist
Wow wow - The end of our lives!
Zeitgeist
Opium

Can you feel them closing in.
The sky has exploded
From powers unseen
Can you feel your struggle
As the dark turns to white
The whitest you've seen

Can you think of
Why they are here
To carve your lungs out
With their little toys
Can you think of why
You were playing on the darkside
As you end in sharp noise

I know... I know... That you can!

Zeitgeist
Wow wow -- Darkness kingsized!
Zeitgeist
Opium
Zeitgeist
Wow wow - The end of our lives!
Zeitgeist
Opium

They count your steps
They count your heartbeats
They count the seconds
That are carved in blood
And you give in for the world
That I show you tonight
Because the shadows strike hard
In the ballrooms of your mind
Opium
And now the devils play their cards
In the graveyard of your time
Opium

Zeitgeist
Wow wow -- Darkness kingsized!
Zeitgeist
Opium
Zeitgeist
Wow wow - The end of our lives!
Zeitgeist
Opium
