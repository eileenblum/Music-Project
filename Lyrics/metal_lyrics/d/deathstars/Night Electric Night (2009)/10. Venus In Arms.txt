Your lips are like morphine
And your eyes are deceit
The make-up runs down into
The bullet wound in your cheek
There's a secret I can share now --
Just don't tell
And is all about lust
There's a world I can show now --
Just don't cry
A black planet of rust
Will this hand destroy you...
Venus in arms
I'll strip you off
In the flood of the light
Venus in arms
You'll taste the dark
Yet so innocent white
Your tongue taste like strychnine
And your long hair is torn
The fancy wings are broken
And a black star is born
There's a venom can you taste it --
Let out your tongue
And it tastes so sweet
There's a diamond can you see it --
Open your eyes
Black sugar deep in the meat
Will this hand destroy you...
Venus in arms
I'll strip you off
In the flood of the light
Venus in arms
You'll taste the dark
Yet so innocent white
And I will suck you
Into the magic turbines of the night
I will lead you to me
And I will tear them down.
All the white stars in your eyes
Then I'll bury them deep
There are the victims of the vices
Which I try to protect
They are the servants of the crisis
Which I try to protect
