The wounds are bleeding from desperate cuts
it's been flooding for days
The heart is fighting to save the last breath
Human oil on highways.

Metal, metal

The blade is thirsting for the juice of mankind
it's been drinking for days.
The chainsaws roar deep inside of god
The blood fills the ashtrays.

I want to spit it out damn damn damn crush doom
The shots are ringing out damn damn damn crush boom.

Metal, metal

The lambs are sleeping on a field of black flames
A club held for the whores
The taste of flesh is the pleasures of doom
Benzine burns on our shores

I want to spit it out damn damn damn crush doom
The shots are ringing out damn damn damn crush boom.

And when the west turn to east we'll feast.
Then we'll find beauty in the pleasures of the beast.

Teach the slaves to bring me power
I'm gonna teach about dark,
I'm gonna teach about night
The destroyed city will burn from the loins of this fight

Teach the slaves to bring me power
I'm gonna teach about dark,
I'm gonna teach about night
A perfect slave will kiss the white lips of the night.

IÂ´m gonna kiss the night

I want to spit it out damn damn damn crush doom
The shots are ringing out damn damn damn crush boom.

Metal
I want to spit it out damn damn damn crush doom
Metal
The shots are ringing out damn damn damn crush boom.

And when the west turn to east we'll feast.
Then we'll find beauty in the pleasures of the beast.
