Guns and ammo lie in front of you
The clips are all loaded, now that shall you do?
This is how it starts
When the end slows wildly in the dark
This is how it starts
When the last breath ends the last speak

Nine, nine, nine!
Millimeter...

Shoot!
The last ammunition
Let the clips fall down
The last ammunition
And fall to the ground

The Desert Eagle spreads its wings for you
Kiss the cold steel
Than let the bullets come through

This is the ultimate and,
I'll make it sure that you will see
As I shall kiss the cold steel
And see how dark this day really can be

Bite the blank steel
Now let the bullet come through
The silver eagle says it's time to...

"Shoot the last ammunition"
Come one and do it now
"Shoot the last ammunition"
I'm going to show you how!

This is how it must end,
So bright shines the pistols
This is how I'll feel
When the last clip is falling
And the barrets are glowing tonight...
