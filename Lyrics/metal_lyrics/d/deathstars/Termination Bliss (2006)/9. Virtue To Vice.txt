Hush...
Don't tell them nothing, not a world
Hush...
Don't tell them nothing,
Not a single thing that I've said to you

Hear all my secrets
Tell all the lies
Hear all my secrets
Tell all the fucking lies

Can you hear it scream
Deep deep inside?

Hush...
Now listen carefully, here it comes
Hush...
It's what I keep inside,
This is the crime that I've tried to hide

Envy
Sloth
Gluttony
Wrath
Pride
Lust
Greed

These secrets I'll bring to you
Are of thorns and ice
These secrets I'll give to you
Will turn virtue to vice

I'll tell you only once...
