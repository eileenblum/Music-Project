Dead starlight bleeds down
On the devil's nitrate
All the nerves of the patients
Bathe in shock and shame
Cause I'm the trigger that'll start this game

And the strike of the night will trash the skyline
And darken the marks I've put in your skin

'Cause I want to play God
With you
I want to rule it all
Rule you

The human cattle lick
On the ethical nightsticks
All the tear of the victims
Run on cold cheeks' meat
Cause here's a future that'll feed on sheep

Let's play a game of two
I'll play God and you'll play you
Let's play a game tonight
I'll play Dark and you'll play Light
