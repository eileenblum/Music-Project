No prayers can reach me here
No light can touch
Among reduced Bibles, cigarettes and drugs
I carve your name in my flesh

Listen... Listen...
... then come and take my hand

Tongues, tongues
Speak the little girls name
Tongues, tongues
... shame, shame

Innocence will never kiss me again
Never lick my stitched scars
Your lipstick's between the legs of helle
Mixed with speed and blood

The eggs grown in her open wrists
It has started now
Her taste is on my lips and tongue
The taste of white medicine

Listen... Listen...
... then come and take my hand
