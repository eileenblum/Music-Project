...In your dreams, hearts shake
Never scream, minds break
Heaven turn, ground crack
Prayers burn, burn back

And it's all there inside of you
It's deadly, dark, cold!
Can you feel the explosion
Now lean back and enjoy the show!

Blitzkrieg!
Blitzkrieg!
Blitzkrieg Boom!

Hope fails, death shines
Long nails, hell's vines
Terror speak, walls fall
Addictions seek, seek it all

Blitzkrieg!
Blitzkrieg!
Blitzkrieg Boom!

...This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on...
As we trigger one last bomb

Wounds bleed, tears ride
Demons feed, angels hide
Fathers sigh, mothers weep
Children cry, crying deep

Fuck the world with a gun
And a broken blade!

...This is the end
Still your need is driven on, driven on...
As we trigger one last bomb
