Did you feel how the bullet took you? Did you feel easily your life got shed?
Did you feel how the system shot you, 9 mm through your fucking head!!!

Well, I love it and I hate it and I take it and feed it
I slay it and I fuck it and I suck it and I leave it

The new dead nation
There's no illusion to chase
And each fucking time I get that shot in my face
The new dead nation

So you felt how the bullet got you, and you felt how your vivid dreams fell dead
And you felt how the system hit you filled your heart with fucking lead

Well, I love it and I hate it and I take it and feed it
I slay it and I fuck it and I suck it and I leave it

The new dead nation
There's no illusion to chase
And each fucking time I get that shot in my face
The new dead nation

I have the soul of a hologram, I have the tongue of a slave
We are the preachers of today, nothing true to preach anyway
For this life and for these lies, so suffer the extremities
Well, I'll kill it for the lies, and death dies

Self-destruction at hand - a way to live and shape your life
But the further it goes the more and more we stretch for the knife

The new dead nation
There's no illusion to chase
And each fucking time I get that shot in my face
The dead nation
