Dreams of violence and murders fall down hard
Interzonic genocide high, the affusion of life

Now it's time for suicide, to break your disbelief
It's time to riddle the flaws of the physique of motors

And as we walk to the lost grounds of heaven tonight
To the battered face of the soul
We are damned from power burnt black

Watch as we crush their laws
Hail to funerals
And feast upon their minds
Pure pain, the bitter solstice bleeds in vain

Cold sky sin, broken veins breathe
Spirit mass corruption of deceit and death
Now it's time for genocide, just another child to burn
More to beat of sin, to the rhythm of darkness deep within

And as we walk to the lost grounds of heaven tonight
To the battered face of the soul
We are damned from power burnt black

Watch as we crush their laws
Hail to funerals
And feast up on their minds
Pure pain, the bitter solstice bleeds in vain
