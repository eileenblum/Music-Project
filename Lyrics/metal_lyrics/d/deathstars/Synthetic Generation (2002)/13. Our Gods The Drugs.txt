I dream...
and the laws of the world breathe cold, weakening to die
And I watch...
I watch the codes of life split in two as the open their arms for me and you

And as they scream as faces of pain betrayed as tears by the rain
And as they sing, they sing your name.
And as they sing as tongues of lies of deceit and of pain

It's our God the Drugs
That twists within and is trying to win
It's our God the Drugs
It's a new world code of bliss dressed in skin

I live but the storm of my heart bleeds of life and of hunger
And I'll die...
And the doors of perception are naked for darkness to take

And as they call as voices of wonder for secrets and truth
And as they die so trashed and neglected... yet with a saint's sympathy

It's our God the Drugs
That twists within and is trying to win
It's our God the Drugs
It's a new world code of bliss dressed in skin

Yet we breathe... terror to some, heaven to others.
What do angels dream, do angels sleep, do demons dream of darkness deep?

It's our God the Drugs
That twists within and is trying to win
It's our God the Drugs
It's a new world code of bliss dressed in skin
