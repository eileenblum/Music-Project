Die, I wanna watch you die as you speak those words to me
Die, I wanna watch you die as you sell those words to please

We were never sheep to keep and guide or a victim by your side

I never asked for that world that you brought me
I never asked for that lie, so damn me as I say goodbye

Fall, your tower falls when you bring its bricks to me
Fall, you want my visions but the sights are too dark to see

We were never sheep to keep and guide or victims by your side

I never asked for that world that you brought me
I never asked for that lie, so damn me as I say goodbye
