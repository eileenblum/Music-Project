How can a pure heart fight without resistance
And I fall never to return, show down, set out to burn
I shun the day - death is one heartbeat away

No light to shun
It's rapture it's pain, it's bodies bleeding in the rain
No light to shun
Never give in - shut down - set for sin
Suffering... suffering... Suffering...

I need to taste the tears of the angels to burn (and I burn...)
Light in exile black nexus, godless child
You have to sleep with daemons to love the wild

No light to shun
It's rapture it's pain, it's bodies bleeding in the rain
No light to shun
Never give in - shut down - set for sin
Suffering... suffering... Suffering...

You will watch the world bleed
No light to shun...
