May the revolution come again, may the evolution come my friend
May the new order take your hand, we walk in lines for the funeral of man

...You watch heaven as we enter hell!!

Revolution, the exodus of souls
Revolution exodus, the paradox of mind
Evolution

May the future open wide tonight, may the true conflicts start the fight
May the stars of death be the only light, upon a future damned and drunk our might

You dream of angels and we bring you hell
Revolution, the exodus of souls
Revolution exodus, the paradox of mind
Evolution

Another flag to burn, laws in chaos and other page to be turned
Strong stand the enemy and shall only stand proud upon the codes of life

Where's your preacher
I've been around since the creation of time
Strip off your soul

And I bend for the
Splendor of death, open my veins for nothing but my selfish desire
Fornicated beyond the laws of the world raped by terror - forever
