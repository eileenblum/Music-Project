Stand here for me angel, Oh little child so broken and wild
Bear not life on your shoulders, just kiss it one last time

Was the music to loud for you, to raw to be true
Were the abstracts too dark for you, I beg you now to
...Watch the sky so bright, see all its light - fade

Here I am, was it everything you spoke of
Oh little angel
Yeah! Here I am, was it everything you've dreamt of
Oh little angel

Bow down for me heavenly one, Shed not those tears my little friend
Fear not god anymore, because you find him in my arms

Was the volume to high for you, to touch for the blue
Were desires too dark for you, to good to be true

...Watch the sky so bright, see all its light - fade

Here I am, was it everything you spoke of
Oh little angel
Yeah! Here I am, was it everything you've dreamt of
Oh little angel

Tell me now how your wings got broken
Tell me now how your spine got whipped by leather
Tell me now how your tongue got spilt
Tell me all the things you need to drift away

Watch the sky so bright, see all its light fade
Watch the sky so full of light
For the last time so bright...
