Their souls encumbered by dead weights
One serves the other to punish with hate
Their souls have become dimmed in fruitless wrath
There's no hope left in this bloodbath

Lost souls doomed to battle
Forever face each other
Wrathful opposing sullen
On going vital fighting

They are never to die
Howling frantic endless sighs
No coming triumph in sight
Because they refused the light

Was this worth all anger?
Trapped in hell forever
Caught in endless pain
Never to return again

Doomed to be immortal
Hate and being brutal
Skinning, biting, destroy
Hungering for final death

Countless souls attacking in the foul slime
In life refused to accept the light
In death they are buried in the wastes
Gargling the words of an endless chant

Lost souls doomed to battle
Forever face each other
Wrathful opposing sullen
On going vital fighting

They are never to die
Howling frantic endless sighs
No coming triumph in sight
Because they refused the light

Was this worth all anger?
Trapped in hell forever
Caught in endless pain
Never to return again

Doomed to be immortal
Hate and being brutal
Skinning, biting, destroy
Hungering for final death

Sullying and squandering, wasted all their light
Bringing them to the brawl of wraiths in fright
Easily grasping their depressing plight
They are doomed to Hell in an endless fight

Lost souls doomed to battle
Forever face each other
Wrathful opposing sullen
On going vital fighting

They are never to die
Howling frantic endless sighs
No coming triumph in sight
Because they refused the light
