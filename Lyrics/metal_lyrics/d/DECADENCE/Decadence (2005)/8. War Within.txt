The leash around my neck
Is pulling me through pain
Don't want to keep following
Struggling to get free again

Stop or soon I'm gonna burst
I don't want to make it hurt
Psyche turned to an empty rift
Killed all that was left inside of it

You are pulling me through pain and hate
Through shattered glass in agony
Torn and slit on a blackened path
My misery is my war within
The wall of strength has crumbled
The wall of battle is by my side
I am stuck in this pattern
The depression eating me alive

I try to compensate my mind
To overcome what I have to hide
My mask covering my face
To hide the fading appearance
I am never going to fail
I'll prove it when I prevail
To show the suffering by repay
I am screaming inside
But I'll find my way

A war heart is what's left inside of me
It's going to lead my way
I'm on my own again
No one can betray

I'll fight along with misery
Hit me, punish, torment me
War within
Never to get to me

You are pulling me through pain and hate
Through shattered glass in agony
Torn and slit on a blackened path
My misery is my war within
The wall of strength has crumbled
The wall of battle is by my side
I am stuck in this pattern
The depression eating me alive

I try to compensate my mind
To overcome what I have to hide
My mask covering my face
To hide the fading appearance
I am never going to fail
I'll prove when I prevail
To show the suffering by repay
I am screaming inside
But I'll find my way
War
I've asked it to be given to me
Sought until I would find the door
Everyone who asks receives
Who seeks will find and destroy
Life is the eternal test
Life is the temporary trust
Will the door be opened again for me?
It is my hope and phobia

You are pulling me through pain and hate
Through shattered glass in agony
Torn and slit on a blackened path
My misery is my war within
The wall of strength has crumbled
The wall of battle is by my side
I am stuck in this pattern
The depression eating me alive

I try to compensate my mind
To overcome what I have to hide
My mask covering my face
To hide the fading appearance
I am never going to fail
I'll prove it when I prevail
To show the suffering by repay
I am screaming inside
But I'll find my way
