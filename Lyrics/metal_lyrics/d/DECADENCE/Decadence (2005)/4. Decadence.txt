Fly covered flesh
On rotting bones
The stench of blood
Agonizing smell of death

Endless time of silence
Energy been lost
Covered in pestilence
Making up the final plot

A forgotten question
Does nothing but fill my mind
All the words that weren't said
Put me on that ride
Too scarred to tell
Rejected heaven for hell
Just another loser astray
In the cycle of decay

Will you be the one,
To dig my dismal grave?
When I'm gone from here,
Will you even slightly care?

Will you leave me subdued,
Like anyone else will?
Or will you be the one to
Stab me for the kill?

A forgotten question
Does nothing but fill my mind
All the words that weren't said
Put me on that ride
Too scarred to tell
Rejected heaven for hell
Just another loser astray
In the cycle of decay

Decadence
Sears through the trees
Cleansing away
The remaining leaves

Roots like spastic hands
In shallow graves
Clutch at the sky
I'm left alone to rot away

A forgotten question
Does nothing but fill my mind
All the words that weren't said
Put me on that ride
Too scarred to tell
Rejected heaven for hell
Just another loser astray
In the cycle of decay
