Everywhere you turn something is forlorn
Drained mind from the time you where born
Twinkling light, a dagger carves the skull
Nothing left, no memories no soul

No feelings left, no emotions, no life
All that is left is demolition and demise
Trapped in a squared empty room
Dark which sticks in as a womb

Stabbing
Twisting
Burning
Pounding

A cut so deep inside my soul
The dagger still caught inside my mind
Cannot run away from the pain
It's carving inside my brain

I am left to pretend
Like I knew what had happened
The pain will not once again leave
But I can't remember who cut me

Panic, to get out of this room
Wanting to get out of the wretched gloom
Must be a way out, can't even shout
Howling like a wolf
Trapped by hunters in the night

Shattering the glass, desperately want to pass
The dagger of the mind's still carving
For the lust of life I'm starving
Fucking let me out!

Stabbing
Twisting
Burning
Pounding

A cut so deep inside my soul
The dagger still caught inside my mind
Cannot run away from the pain
It's carving inside my brain

I am left to pretend
Like I knew what had happened
The pain will not once again leave
But I can't remember who cut me
