The dark turned into grey
During the golden age of sin
Into distance it let me fade
But I'll never let it win

There is only one guarantee
It's the cycle of suffering
I look ahead for the end
That I don't want to see

I got a heavy dose of it
Like a shot piercing my skin
I got it twofold what you all did
But I fought while you all hid
You're still that little kid
Who never got caught in the grid
Where they injected the heavy dose
The heavy quantity of pain

It all feels like hell
Did the pain get there to stay?
Because I die when this feeling comes alive

The anger is around my neck
It's there like a noose that wants to break
My sore life all into pieces
To end the dying beating

I got a heavy dose of it
Like a shot piercing my skin
I got it twofold what you all did
But I fought while you all hid
You're still that little kid
Who never got caught in the grid
Where they injected the heavy dose
The heavy quantity of pain

A heavy dose of nothing is not enough
A heavy dose of everything is just as tough
A heavy dose of something is like a lure to be repelled
A heavy dose of anything is hell

I got a heavy dose of it
Like a shot piercing my skin
I got it twofold what you all did
But I fought while you all hid
You're still that little kid
Who never got caught in the grid
Where they injected the heavy dose
The heavy quantity of pain
