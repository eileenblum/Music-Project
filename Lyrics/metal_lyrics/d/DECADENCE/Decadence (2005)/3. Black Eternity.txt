Never will it stop, future black eternity
Struggling the past, struggling to see
I only want to know where I'm heading to
It's all the same, whatever I do

I hope it will stop, this deep animosity
Give my feelings back and end this misery
Nothing can I do, except to keep on fighting
Slowly killing my soul like struck by lightning

Black eternity
Haunts me now
Black eternity
Go on leave me
Black eternity
I got nothing to give
Black eternity
Let me live

I'd do anything to make the memories disappear
What's left now is fighting the fear of fear
There's a feeling deep inside that don't want to let go
I try to move on even though I'm on my own

I hope it will stop, this deep animosity
Give my feelings back and end this misery
Nothing can I do, except to keep on fighting
Slowly killing my soul like struck by lightning

Black eternity
Haunts me now
Black eternity
Go on leave me
Black eternity
I got nothing to give
Black eternity
Let me live

To change what's done
When all is said and gone?
The many turned to none
It's time to take me home

I hope it will stop, this deep animosity
Give my feelings back and end this misery
Nothing can I do, except to keep on fighting
Slowly killing my soul like struck by lightning

Black eternity
Haunts me now
Black eternity
Go on leave me
Black eternity
I got nothing to give
Black eternity
Let me live
