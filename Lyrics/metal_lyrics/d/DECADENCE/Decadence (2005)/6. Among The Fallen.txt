No one sees the raven inside my soul
It wants to get out and rips me till I'm torn
Everything I do always turns out wrong
The fallen I was placed among

My frayed soul is soon but gone
Nothing will be left because I'm the one
Been chosen to stand in the flames
While you are laughing at my pain

Misery, I'm here among the fallen
Melancholy, screaming, despair, pain, help calls and tragedy
Please stop the tragic memories
Treachery, I have no one but myself

I want to scream but my voice is gone
Eternal night's over the dying sun
In my dreams, light still appears
But when I wake up I'm covered with tears

The time that has passed, is nothing but a blur
That what I saw of life, no one wants to learn
The shadow of doom stands above my path
I can never go back to the past

Misery, I'm here among the fallen
Melancholy, screaming, despair, pain, help calls and tragedy
Please stop the tragic memories
Agony, I am doomed to a life in eternal flames

Please save me

Misery, I'm here among the fallen
Melancholy, screaming, despair, pain, help calls and tragedy
Please stop the tragic memories
Treachery, I am in eternal hell but something wild did survive
