In the shadow at the end we do not see
The sadness in their eyes before they betray thee
I walk in the dark, along the heavy wall
I see them always stronger, better arms, never to fall
Here I am alone
Shall I walk on to the dead-end?
To die or to pretend
Then it's thyself who forgives thee
Out of you will have passed all capacity
To be hunted, nothing more
Pain in the pounding sore

[Pre chorus]
In the steep emptiness of the gorge
In the way quieter than a whisper forge
Annihilation's not that difficult
Just open the wound and fill it with salt

[Chorus]
Sun gone down, the last light failing
Afterglow from the last sunlight faded
They survive to enslave thee again
We do not have a God but a hell
A dark passage leading to nowhere and on
Dark never-ending, suddenly all gone
Now there's nothing more to see
The bell tolls for thee

The fear was made of what I had been through
The apprehension was for the evil I would do
In the sack is the essence of all
Dead earth and the dead stalks of fall
They're from the flowers and their rotten blooms
The smell that is death in the sinful gloom
Thou wilt wrap this sack around thy head
Inhalest deeply, and smell the odor of death

[Pre chorus]
Faint, muted, dry and far away
We are all in the same cauldron left to stay
There's a scream that will never die
It will go forever It will always cry

[Chorus]
Sun gone down, the last light failing
Afterglow from the last sunlight faded
They survive to enslave thee again
We do not have a God but a hell
A dark passage leading to nowhere and on
Dark never-ending, suddenly all gone
Now there's nothing more to see
The bell tolls for thee

[Pre chorus]
In the steep emptiness of the gorge
In the way quieter than a whisper forge
Annihilation's not that difficult
Just open the wound and fill it with salt

Hated injustice, hated cruelty
Lay in my rage that blind my mind
That was given to me because
I never asked for it
I was not the aim but I got hit
Time is shortening, there's one direction to go
No, no, please no, no!
Just save me from this eternal hell
Free me from the tolling bell

[Pre chorus]
Faint, muted, dry and far away
We are all in the same cauldron left to stay
There's a scream that will never die
It will go forever
It will always cry

[Chorus]
Sun gone down, the last light failing
Afterglow from the last sunlight faded
They survive to enslave thee again
We do not have a God but a hell
A dark passage leading to nowhere and on
Dark never-ending, suddenly all gone
Now there's nothing more to see
The bell tolls for thee
