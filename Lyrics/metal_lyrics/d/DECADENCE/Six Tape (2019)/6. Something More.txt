Who cares? So what?
No demands, no plans.
Barefoot in loose-fit clothes.
Untied from mechanical landscapes.
Simply re-synchronized.

Seeing all taking form.
Seeing all crumble down.
Getting back up again.
Knowing something more is out there.

EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
NOT ENOUGH, WEAK AND POOR.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
HAVING TASTED SOMETHING MORE.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
NOT ENOUGH, WEAK AND POOR.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
HAVING TASTED SOMETHING MORE.

It's time, one step down the staircase.
Almost on the ground.
So lift the veil off every detail.
Let's see what shall be found.

Seeing all taking form.
Seeing all crumble down.
Getting back up again.
Knowing something more is out there.

EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
NOT ENOUGH, WEAK AND POOR.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
HAVING TASTED SOMETHING MORE.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
NOT ENOUGH, WEAK AND POOR.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
HAVING TASTED SOMETHING MORE.

I need something stronger than this.
Larger than life itself. I'm taking it.

Need something more than pain.
Need something more than pain.
Need something more than pain.
Need something more than pain.

Seeing all taking form.
Seeing all crumble down.
Getting back up again.
Knowing something more is out there.

EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
NOT ENOUGH, WEAK AND POOR.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
HAVING TASTED SOMETHING MORE.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
NOT ENOUGH, WEAK AND POOR.
EVERYTHING LACKS SUBSTANCE,
HAVING TASTED SOMETHING MORE.
