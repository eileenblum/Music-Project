Unbreakable heroine,
Set to win the true dark hearts, say
"Where's my stage?".

Shivers, trembling to the bone.
Rigid, emotionless and cold.

THE RITUAL SCENE.
OH WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
SHINY VINYL SKIN
JOGGED THE MEMORY.
GOT SOME EDGE TO KILL, RIGHT?
INTIMATE AND DAMN TIGHT.
FIRE AND FUEL. LATEX RITUALS.

Everyone's fantasy,
But no one's reality, say
"It's my place".

Shivers, trembling to the bone.
Rigid, emotionless and cold.

THE RITUAL SCENE.
OH WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
SHINY VINYL SKIN
JOGGED THE MEMORY.
GOT SOME EDGE TO KILL, RIGHT?
INTIMATE AND DAMN TIGHT.
FIRE AND FUEL. LATEX RITUALS.

Feeling like the 3rd stage.
I see you, you watch me.
Like someone else but not at all.
That everyday rusty old cage.
Now gives use to all that rage.

Body's strong, now give it to them,
What they want: "I am prepared".
What was that, say it again?
"Yeah, you heard it â I'm here to stay."

In goddess mode. Taking on
The part expected to perform, say
"Bring it on".

Shivers, trembling to the bone.
Rigid, emotionless and cold.

THE RITUAL SCENE.
OH WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
SHINY VINYL SKIN
JOGGED THE MEMORY.
GOT SOME EDGE TO KILL, RIGHT?
INTIMATE AND DAMN TIGHT.
FIRE AND FUEL. LATEX RITUALS.
