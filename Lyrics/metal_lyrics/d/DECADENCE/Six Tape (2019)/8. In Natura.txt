A daily taste of the haste.
Tempo! Speed! Rhythm delayed.
Zephyrs of cold heal the pain.
They seek burnt up energy.

Killed all beauty for duty.
Stripped down and dove into the sea.

IN NATURA WE FLY.
WITH CLOSED EYES.
SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN LIVES.
RAW AND PURE.
IN NATURA WE FLY.
WITH CLOSED EYES.
OF ORGANIC ROOTS IN DESIGN.
UNTAINTED NATURAL.

Walking miles to stabilize.
Pressure! Stress! To win more time.
Blackened mind and heart off-guard.
While they keep pushing and pushing hard.

Killed all beauty for duty.
Stripped down and dove into the sea.

IN NATURA WE FLY.
WITH CLOSED EYES.
SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN LIVES.
RAW AND PURE.
IN NATURA WE FLY.
WITH CLOSED EYES.
OF ORGANIC ROOTS IN DESIGN.
UNTAINTED NATURAL.

Stressâ¦

Had it with this life.
See you in the wild.
For nature is my home.
Had it with these clothes,
so off they go.

Insights from inside the cage.
Dressed up in a power suit.
Where everyone grind for the wage.
Underneath fluorescent tubes.

Killed all beauty for duty.
Stripped down and dove into the sea.

IN NATURA WE FLY.
WITH CLOSED EYES.
SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN LIVES.
RAW AND PURE.
IN NATURA WE FLY.
WITH CLOSED EYES.
OF ORGANIC ROOTS IN DESIGN.
UNTAINTED NATURAL.
