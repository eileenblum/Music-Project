Trinity,
The line connecting worlds.
The serpentine road.
Leading to the emerald sea.
Tangerine soil underneath fallen leafs.
Mountains shield the void.
The sanctuary.

There is mystery in this trilogy.
Running in the bloodstream.
In mind, heart and soul.

THE LINE MERGES THROUGH THE NORDIC COLD.
SOUL DIVIDED, BETWEEN THESE WORLDS.
LIVED ALL OVER AND LEFT EVERY HOME.
ALWAYS ROAMING, READY TO EXPLORE.

Trinity,
The line connecting Steam City.
Surrounded by sand.
Shorelines of amber stones.
Whirr of turning wheels
and battering machinery.
Waters shield the core.
The foundation.

There is mystery in this trilogy.
Running in the bloodstream.
In mind, heart and soul.

THE LINE MERGES THROUGH THE NORDIC COLD.
SOUL DIVIDED, BETWEEN THESE WORLDS.
LIVED ALL OVER AND LEFT EVERY HOME.
ALWAYS ROAMING, READY TO EXPLORE.

I am the sanctuary, the escape.
I am the foundation, the strength.
I am the ice sovereign, detached.
Where lost come to get back on track.

There is mystery in this trilogy.
Running in the bloodstream.
In mind, heart and soul.

THE LINE MERGES THROUGH THE NORDIC COLD.
SOUL DIVIDED, BETWEEN THESE WORLDS.
LIVED ALL OVER AND LEFT EVERY HOME.
ALWAYS ROAMING, READY TO EXPLORE.
