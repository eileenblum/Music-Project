That's enough, this is where it ends.
No load heavier than this one.
Time is up, yet all hesitant.
No one can even make a choice.

Tighter, tighter, getting tight.

Go! Re-group, put all things in line.
Think straight and concentrate this time.
All will break and be split apart,
if no one is willing to take charge.

Tighter, tighter, getting tight.

ONCE THERE WAS A TIME, WHEN PEOPLE WOULD SPEAK THEIR MIND. QUESTIONING ORDERS. USING COMMON SENSE, TO SEEK OUT OTHER WAYS AROUND, NOT DO AS ALWAYS. THAT FIRE DIED IN FAVOR OF PRESTIGE. THAT FIRE IS WHAT MADE IT GENUINE.

Those who aren't willing to own,
even a small part of the bigger whole,
they will not be responsible,
and will never know what it means to grow.

Tighter, tighter, getting tight.

ONCE THERE WAS A TIME, WHEN PEOPLE WOULD SPEAK THEIR MIND. QUESTIONING ORDERS. USING COMMON SENSE, TO SEEK OUT OTHER WAYS AROUND, NOT DO AS ALWAYS. THAT FIRE DIED IN FAVOR OF PRESTIGE. THAT FIRE IS WHAT MADE IT GENUINE.

Tighter, tighterâ¦
That's why they deceive or leave.
Tighter, tighterâ¦
Because it's hard to lead.

Tighter, tighterâ¦
Focus when it's hard to breathe.
Tighter, tighterâ¦
One for all, make them believe.

ONCE THERE WAS A TIME, WHEN PEOPLE WOULD SPEAK THEIR MIND. QUESTIONING ORDERS. USING COMMON SENSE, TO SEEK OUT OTHER WAYS AROUND, NOT DO AS ALWAYS. THAT FIRE DIED IN FAVOR OF PRESTIGE. THAT FIRE IS WHAT MADE IT GENUINE.
