So much more meaning in this than anything around.
Gained a solid knowledge base to do what satisfies.
Making this the playground where the tyrants shall fall.
Giving room for those who fought morally for their cause.

Standing up for those who dare to do things their own way.
Staying true to resistance and that's where we will remain.
Going up against the pack where they've got each other's backs.
Standing strong with the only ones who will never sell out.

CREATIVITY SHOULD BE FREE.
IF SOMEONE SHARES IT, LET IT BE.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
GIVE AND TAKE OR IT'S HYPOCRISY.

EXPOSURE â OF THE FALSE.
EXPOSURE â OF THE FRAUD.
EXPOSURE â OF THE GREED.
EXPOSURE â OF DECEIT.

Vital part to keep in mind is who stood on the lines.
Surely not those now in line to reap the benefits.
Build legacy on the real, the righteous, the sincere.
The rest can join the mob of those who act for fine careers.

CREATIVITY SHOULD BE FREE.
IF SOMEONE SHARES IT, LET IT BE.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
GIVE AND TAKE OR IT'S HYPOCRISY.

EXPOSURE â OF THE FALSE.
EXPOSURE â OF THE FRAUD.
EXPOSURE â OF THE GREED.
EXPOSURE â OF DECEIT.

Chasing the dream instead of the rivalry.
Reaching the peak with means that are all clean.
The sweat and pain, the fights, the strain make it all real.

Here's a story of what carves the way to reach success.
Turn head left and right to see who's there to clean the mess.
That's the army that will lead it all to victory.
Feel the fire not cast commercialized machines.

CREATIVITY SHOULD BE FREE.
IF SOMEONE SHARES IT, LET IT BE.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
GIVE AND TAKE OR IT'S HYPOCRISY.

EXPOSURE â OF THE FALSE.
EXPOSURE â OF THE FRAUD.
EXPOSURE â OF THE GREED.
EXPOSURE â OF DECEIT.
