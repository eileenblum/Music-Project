Shooting pool, local joint, just rocking out. In the city's side-line. Moving on into town, there Lo arrived. To stir up the crowd. This time everyone had turned their back, the inner circle was cracked. All split and before the dawn would break, the final choice was made.

LO,
TAKES ANOTHER BULLET AND GOES.
VAGABOND IN MIND AND SOUL.
HAS IT ALL BUT IS ALONE.
STRAY IN A WORLD THAT'S GROWN.

At the bar, solo tour at Geronimo's. All dressed in black. Fed up with the fuss, had to take a rest. Had to breathe a while. It's time to leave that love behind. It came too near. So, that was what the rolling stone did, after one more beer.

LO,
TAKES ANOTHER BULLET AND GOES.
VAGABOND IN MIND AND SOUL.
HAS IT ALL BUT IS ALONE.
STRAY IN A WORLD THAT'S GROWN.

Lo Badland.

So, the thoughts drown by metallic sound. I'm going back on the road. Closest are gone now, the rest are loud. Always wanting more. A rover's night will never be over. So Lo went on. Real family for someone left with nobody. And the show went on.

LO,
TAKES ANOTHER BULLET AND GOES.
VAGABOND IN MIND AND SOUL.
HAS IT ALL BUT IS ALONE.
STRAY IN A WORLD THAT'S GROWN.
