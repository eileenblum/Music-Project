Like a hidden fox. Living in a herd of mindless sheep.
For a while there was denial. Now itâs become a precious treat.
Played the little game. The special one called life they say.
If that is what it is thatâs the cue to go. To defeat the world.

Escaping reality. To find imperfection.
And do what time does. Move on.

TO A PLACE. TO A PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME.
FEELS LIKE HOME. BUT IT NEVER WAS. NOTHING IS.
AS THE BEAT GOES ON. LEADS TOWARDS THE SOUND.
STRONGER IT BECOMES. WHEN IT FEELS THE UNDERGROUND.
THE UNDERGROUND.

Dodged all bullets. Contradicted the doubters and prepared to rise.
From the dust of another version. That has qualified.
To explore and wander free. Impulsively far away from routine.
A success or a mess. Only as long as itâs against the stream.

Escaping reality. To find imperfection.
And do what time does. Move on.

TO A PLACE. TO A PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME.
FEELS LIKE HOME. BUT IT NEVER WAS. NOTHING IS.
AS THE BEAT GOES ON. LEADS TOWARDS THE SOUND.
STRONGER IT BECOMES. WHEN IT FEELS THE UNDERGROUND.
THE UNDERGROUND.

Fire is where some will lose. When others are renewed.
Burns not by its caress. But when the ease returns.
Stay and confront the world. There are no substitutes.
Fight and be the fucking king. A solo flight on strongest wings.

Deep roots. Insanity. Buried deeply down in the underground.

Escaping reality. To find imperfection.
And do what time does. Move on.

TO A PLACE. TO A PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME.
FEELS LIKE HOME. BUT IT NEVER WAS. NOTHING IS.
AS THE BEAT GOES ON. LEADS TOWARDS THE SOUND.
STRONGER IT BECOMES. WHEN IT FEELS THE UNDERGROUND.
THE UNDERGROUND.
