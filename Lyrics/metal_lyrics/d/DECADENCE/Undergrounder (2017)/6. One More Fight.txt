The best fighter is never angry. Not ever showing any pain.
So itâs time to pick your fate. Be the hammer or the nail.
The inner fire is what defines you. All you need to keep and possess.
Hold your breath. Avoid the risk. Thatâs the safe route to death.

ITâS A WAY FOR ME TO FACE MY DEMONS.
AS I NEVER SEE THE FIGHT IN A COMPETITORâS EYES. I SEE IT IN MYSELF.
THE ROAD TO WINâS SUPREME. MANY THINGS IâVE SEEN.
BUT THEREâS ONE MORE FIGHT TO DO.

Some lost in flames. Some built from remains.
Some are knocked out cold.

Tell me I canât and Iâll prove you wrong. Even if it means agony.
Conquer yourself. The greatest of wins. Dominating one hundred fights.
You donât know strength. Until the choice you have is to use every ounce of it.
Youâll never know your power. Until you are hurt bad.

ITâS A WAY FOR ME TO FACE MY DEMONS.
AS I NEVER SEE THE FIGHT IN A COMPETITORâS EYES. I SEE IT IN MYSELF.
THE ROAD TO WINâS SUPREME. MANY THINGS IâVE SEEN.
BUT THEREâS ONE MORE FIGHT TO DO.

Steadiness. Determination. Focus. Decadence.

So itâs time to meet eye to eye. Mystified, psyched, antagonized.
Lit the fire that should feed the fight. For whatâs right.
Feeds my will to stay alive.

Iâll shoot for the moon and the reason why. Is all stars are born in the sky.
The enemy is fighting me because Iâm tough. And not because Iâm weak.
Not going to stop when Iâm tired and burnt. Only going to stop when Iâm done.
So all that is on my mind. Is how Iâll put âem down.

ITâS A WAY FOR ME TO FACE MY DEMONS.
AS I NEVER SEE THE FIGHT IN A COMPETITORâS EYES. I SEE IT IN MYSELF.
THE ROAD TO WINâS SUPREME. MANY THINGS IâVE SEEN.
BUT THEREâS ONE MORE FIGHT TO DO.
