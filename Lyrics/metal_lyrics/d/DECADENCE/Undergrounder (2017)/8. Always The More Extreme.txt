Itâs my turn to be questioned. Hit me with all youâve got.
Not what I had expected. For doing things that you would never do.
I have done my part. Always the more extreme.
I know who I am and I know you can see. Iâm covered in dirt to keep you clean.

WHEN DARKNESS SEES YOU. SHINE.
LOOK AT THE SKY. LIGHT FAR BEYOND ILLUSION.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

Denying a programmed setting. Life without bounds has no shape.
Always pushing to move past the illusion. To touch and feel the reality of dreams.
Reaching far beyond. Determined drive to evolve.
A scavenger hunt through the scattered debris. Learning from every war.

WHEN DARKNESS SEES YOU. SHINE.
LOOK AT THE SKY. LIGHT FAR BEYOND ILLUSION.
ITâS CLEAR TO ME.

If you touch darkness. It touches you back. Burns like fire.
The pain will remain and will power the mind. To climb even higher.
Fulfillment and closure will never occur. In my rising dawn.
So lure conformity straight into death. Stand alone. Put it down.

Hell has given me something. Created a balanced pain.
Any strike is predicted. Reminded by scars that were made.
All that counts is gone. Forces that counter remain.
Dignity in hanging on. And in the strength to give it all.

WHEN DARKNESS SEES YOU. SHINE.
LOOK AT THE SKY. LIGHT FAR BEYOND ILLUSION.
THATâS WHAT DRIVES ME.
