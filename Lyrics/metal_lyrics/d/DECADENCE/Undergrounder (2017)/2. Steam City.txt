Is this what you want? And no response.
A job to do. A nightly hunt.
Blackness in the air. A silent prayer.
Riotâs coming up. Beware.

Close your eyes. And count to three.
What are you afraid to see?

WHEEL MOVING FAST. ROPES START TO BURN.
ABOVE SET ON WHATâS TO EARN.
WHAT STRINGS TO PULL. WHERE TO FIND FUEL.
FASTER AND FASTER. MAKE THEM SPIN AND TURN.
STEAM CITY WILL GROW. FED BY THE POISON.

Now thereâs two. Join our move.

So easy to destroy. Hard to restore.
Jump the gun. And speak your mind.
Easier to forget. Than to regret.
Or shut up and be the blind.

Close your eyes. And count to three.
What are you afraid to see?

WHEEL MOVING FAST. ROPES START TO BURN.
ABOVE SET ON WHATâS TO EARN.
WHAT STRINGS TO PULL. WHERE TO FIND FUEL.
FASTER AND FASTER. MAKE THEM SPIN AND TURN.
STEAM CITY WILL GROW. FED BY THE POISON.

Now thereâs two. Join our move.

Join us. The riot is before us. Join us.
Yeah itâs heavy. But weâll prove our point is as heavy.

Down. Down. Going down. Down. Going down.

It is that one step down. To the underground league.
True extreme supremacy.
It is that one step down. To the underground league.
Away from the mainstream.

Dirt, toxin and poison. Creeps in me.
Heavy air. And hard to breathe.
Will not end up where no one ever leaves.
Strongest go first. It seems.

Close your eyes. And count to three.
What are you afraid to see?

WHEEL MOVING FAST. ROPES START TO BURN.
ABOVE SET ON WHATâS TO EARN.
WHAT STRINGS TO PULL. WHERE TO FIND FUEL.
