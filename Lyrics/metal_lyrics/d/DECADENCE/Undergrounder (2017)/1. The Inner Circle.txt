Living the high. Invincible.
No fear to die. Living the now.
Thrill delight. To rule and own the night.

Kick out the jams. The leather creaks.
Cobblestones meet Cuban heels.
Hunt the ground. Make a scene. Intervene. Feel it.

To be living on the edge. Long nights. Jamming on.

SINGING ALONG. EACH AND EVERY SONG.
BAND OF BROTHERS. A PLACE TO BELONG.
FAR AND GONE BUT STILL WITHIN.
THE INNER CIRCLE OF SIN.

Frozen city calls. RSVP.
Come and see. Itâs wild and free.
Make a deal. Rendezvous with ruin.

Black luxury. Strutting the streets.
Doors all open, take a seat.
Kill appeal. The will to stay alive.

To be living on the edge. Long nights. Jamming on.

SINGING ALONG. EACH AND EVERY SONG.
BAND OF BROTHERS. A PLACE TO BELONG.
FAR AND GONE BUT STILL WITHIN.
THE INNER CIRCLE OF SIN.

See. Time cannot heal. It can replace memories.
Turn poison into cure. Spread it out. Live it out. And live it loud.
Be the first to pass. Raise your bloody glass.

Sitting on the night train. The philosopher is born.
Love lost at such a cost. What means what anymore?
This is my station. Cheers my friends. That was the end.
Ride that tore us apart. Good morning, pain.

Singing along each song.

Living on the edge.
Living on the edge.
Living on the edge.

Living on the edge.
Living on the edge.
Living on the edge.
