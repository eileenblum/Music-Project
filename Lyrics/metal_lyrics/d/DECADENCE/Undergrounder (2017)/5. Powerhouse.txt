Look at this place. Here at last.
Now let the hours pass. This is now whatâs home.
Subjects in wheels. In search for their souls.
Close the lid of the coffin. Rest in the hands of doom.
Because there is a hole there. Letting the load sip through.

Oh this pain is too real.
Hey, hey! Stand up and fight or kneel.
Know what youâve got to do.
Hey, hey! Knew what you got into.

Swallowed a spine. To make me rise.
Black striped eyes stare back and ask:

WHO ARE YOU NOW? DO YOU SEE?
LINES FADED OUT. YOU ARE FREE.
CHILL WITH PILL. OR TURN LEFT.
OUT IT GOES NOW. MAKE IT SWEAT.
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE? FOUGHT FOR MONTHS.
WHATâD IT BECOME? A POWERHOUSE.
WHAT WERE THE MEANS? HEAVIER LOADS.
TO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL IT HOLDS.

It has become a habitat. I like it a lot like that.
Energy in and out. Wondering what the fuzz was about.
The spine in place to stretch out. Adrenalin vessels all pumped.
Living it up. The moment arrived.
Today is mine. I feel divine.

Oh this pain is too real.
Hey, hey! Stand up and fight or kneel.
Know what youâve got to do.
Hey, hey! Knew what you got into.

Swallowed a spine. To make me rise.
Black striped eyes stare back and ask:

WHO ARE YOU NOW? DO YOU SEE?
LINES FADED OUT. YOU ARE FREE.
CHILL WITH PILL. OR TURN LEFT.
OUT IT GOES NOW. MAKE IT SWEAT.
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE? FOUGHT FOR MONTHS.
WHATâD IT BECOME? A POWERHOUSE.
WHAT WERE THE MEANS? HEAVIER LOADS.
TO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL IT HOLDS.

They whisper in my mind.
They are calling me home.

Stepped out of the door. Out of the house.
Cleaned up the mess. On the doorstep.
Told the punks to go to hell. A flash of a past to be erased.
Buried the pills deep in the heaps. Placed in the garden of graves.
One for each of the memories. Finally free to be me.

Oh this pain is too real.
Hey, hey! Stand up and fight or kneel.
Know what youâve got to do.
Hey, hey! Knew what you got into.

Swallowed a spine. To make me rise.

TO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL IT HOLDS.

Power of choice. Power.
Power of choice. Power.
