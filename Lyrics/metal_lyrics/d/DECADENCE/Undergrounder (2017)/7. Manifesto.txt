Thereâs no hell like your own hell. Cut all roots and move on to level 6.
Resist those who seek to violate. The right to live as a suited for one.
Strike back to survive in any way. In a pursuit to recruit new truths.
Lead by means of a complex link. Intelligence without leadership.

WE ARE EVERYONE. WE ARE NO ONE.
UNITED AS ONE. DIVIDED BY NONE.
THE ONE WHO IS MANY. BRINGER OF ORDER TO CHAOS.

Manifesto.

Rip through the structure of time. The power of a unified hive.
Seek to rise and dominate. Growing through a knowledge base.
Riot in the underground. The movement has begun to scrutinize.
Target the need not the rival technique. The paradigm is what we seek.

WE ARE EVERYONE. WE ARE NO ONE.
UNITED AS ONE. DIVIDED BY NONE.
THE ONE WHO IS MANY. BRINGER OF ORDER TO CHAOS.

We are the legion.
We are the legion.
We are the legion.
We are the legion.

Thereâs an evil feeling that remains. Something that is driving us insane.
We are one as we are all the same. But the difference is who dares to scratch corrosion.

Revolution. No one has ever seen before.
An expression. Without any written words.
Determination. Not to leave a stone unturned.

WE ARE EVERYONE. WE ARE NO ONE.
UNITED AS ONE. DIVIDED BY NONE.
THE ONE WHO IS MANY. BRINGER OF ORDER TO CHAOS.
