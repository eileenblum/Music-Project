My whole body hurts so bad
This is a fate I shouldn't have had
Growing to be dry bones and ashes
Bleeding red inside from rips and gashes

Red, too dim to see
Blood forever bleeds
Fire is burning me
Pain, make it leave

Red is the end blurring my sight
Red is the end after defeat in this fight
Red is the end at the warning alert
Red is the end coloring my earth

Sickening to see dreams die
All it takes is to realize
Stranded in a waterless sea
Just see the red image of mercy

Red, too dim to see
Blood forever bleeds
Fire is burning me
Pain, make it leave

Red is the end blurring my sight
Red is the end after defeat in this fight
Red is the end at the warning alert
Red is the end coloring my earth

I am now in this world to stay
To chase my demons away

Red, too dim to see
Blood forever bleeds
Fire is burning me
Pain, make it leave

Red is the end blurring my sight
Red is the end after defeat in this fight
Red is the end at the warning alert
Red is the end coloring my earth

Demonic creatures hide in my mind
A morbid truth one cannot hide
I'm not ready to go
Never take me away from home
