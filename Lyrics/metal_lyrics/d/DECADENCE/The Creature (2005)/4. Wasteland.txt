All covered in a sandy desert haze
The fallout turned it all into a blaze
Left alone in this land of nothingness
Always facing the common weakness

Clad in leather to roam the land
Breathing for survival while crawling in the sand
Only living for my own self
The biggest mistake is to trust someone else

A silent whisper recalling a memory
Remembering something that once was my family
The world before is past and gone
Life in wasteland just begun

My name they call, Mad is the given one
Shouldn't have survived was supposed to die
Alone there, all close are out of sight
All I have now is my dismal life

In front of me there's nothing but dust
Far has past the will for life and lust
All who cared are far away
The last memories of pre war are to fade

Kill all that lives in self defense
All that is left is to scavenge and cleanse
Find another town to watch and explore
Find yet others who cry and mourn

No fear left only hate
Is this my final fate?

A silent whisper recalling a memory
Remembering something that once was my family
The world before is past and gone
Life in wasteland just begun

My name they call, Mad is the given one
Shouldn't have survived was supposed to die
Die, die, die
