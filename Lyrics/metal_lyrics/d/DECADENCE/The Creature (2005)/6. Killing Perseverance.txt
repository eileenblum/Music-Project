As I drift through the hallways of darkness
I'm being chased by the suffering fathomless
The path is dark, creatures reeking of decay
Can't say what hurts but to keep them away

Towards the darkness
I am drawing near
Sounds of haunted chants
Killing perseverance

Surrounded by the haunted
Drifting in the darkness
Feeling constant terror
Mind heavy with horror

I can't get out, I'm caught here forever
Dying again in a permanent cycle
This is my life to be eternal
This is my own hellish inferno

Towards the darkness
I am drawing near
Sounds of haunted chants
Killing perseverance

Surrounded by the haunted
Drifting in the darkness
Feeling constant terror
Mind heavy with horror

Incessant circle, nowhere to find an end
I died there a little more once again
Nevermore will I remain in peace to rest
I will die more in the next coming test
