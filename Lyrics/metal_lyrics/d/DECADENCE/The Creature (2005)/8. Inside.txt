Waking up, was that a dream?
A living nightmare's all I see
The strongest one of them all
Laying there, pushed to fall

I collect my final strength
It's not enough, there's so much left
I want to give it away
To make the past stay

I see it right before me
There, open, standing with pride
Like a red healthy looking apple
Beautiful but rotten inside

Lost in damned metastasis
Should have been anything but this
My tears will no more help
All that's left is to fight death

I so desperately want to give
Back the strength to make you live
Gone, is no word for me
Stay, is the one I accept to see

Why did it choose this way
Please don't leave, just stay
If you are taken away
My roots are cut from me

I see it right before me
There, open, standing with pride
Like a red healthy looking apple
Beautiful but rotten inside

Lost in damned metastasis
Should have been anything but this
My tears will no more help
All that's left is to fight death

This vicious silent killer
Wants to block every way of return
Eating inside, slowly by time
You have to be saved now

I see you smile once again
I know, you know it's not a game
It's all there in your mind
You have to leave it all behind

Inside me forever lay
My memories, my hope will stay
I want you to pull it through
Fight, kill, recover, prove

I see it right before me
There, open, standing with pride
Like a red healthy looking apple
Beautiful but rotten inside

Lost in damned metastasis
Should have been anything but this
My tears will no more help
I don't want you to go
