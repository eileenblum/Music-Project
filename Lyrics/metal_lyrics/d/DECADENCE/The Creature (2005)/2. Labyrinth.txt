Looking around but I cannot find
What I'm looking for I am not sure
I want to get the fuck out of this place
Blocked by walls in front of my face

Where am I? Am I far from where I was?
I am already far and lost
Search for humanity, totally detached
Callously left to persist and last

Walking around, I can only see walls
Trapped inside long dark vicious halls
Help me! Why can't anyone hear me?
Am I the only one hearing these calls?

I was here already before
I'll go back but I won't find the door
All from here is gone but me
No release from this never-ending labyrinth

I walk in my own footprints
I feel the cold winds, they blow in my face
Ensuring me, I walk towards the dead
But I'm lost, where am I to head?

Lead me to the exit door
I hear my steps on the cold empty floor
I am dying, I want to get out
It's so silent, scares me to the core

Walking around, I can only see walls
Trapped inside long dark vicious halls
Help me! Why can't anyone hear me?
Am I the only one hearing these calls?

I was here already before
I'll go back but I won't find the door
All from here is gone but me
No release from this never-ending labyrinth

No one from outside will come
I know, because you're all gone
If you would be here you would have shown
That earth is not as cold as stone

I know you think I'm lost forever
You're wrong, I'm stronger than ever
Spit before me and laugh with pride
I'm am stone cold and will forever stride

Walking around, I can only see walls
Trapped inside long dark vicious halls
Help me! Why can't anyone hear me
Am I the only one hearing these calls?

I was here already before
I'll go back but I won't find the door
All from here is gone but me
Who will now set me free?
