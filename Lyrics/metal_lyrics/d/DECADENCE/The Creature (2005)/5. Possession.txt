When my soul was filling with warmth again
The spark in my eyes resurrecting from the pain
But you took it all into your possession
I believed you but you betrayed me

I did believe your words
Didn't care for the things I heard
Never to become a possession
Kill me instead in frenzied obsession

You thought you had control
Possessing all as your own
A disappointment to my eyes
A failure in disguise

You crossed the flaming line; you took away what's mine
You took that part of my heart with you
You wanted to have there me as your own
But left me dead to remain alone

I did believe your words
Didn't care for the things I heard
Never to become a possession
Kill me instead in frenzied obsession

You thought you had control
Possessing all as your own
A disappointment to my eyes
A failure in disguise

My eyes now full of hate, making you desperate
You try to escape from your fucking reality
Until you understand, I won't leave you be
I will make you know, you will never possess me

I did believe your words
Didn't care for the things I heard
Never to become a possession
Kill me instead in frenzied obsession

You thought you had control
Possessing all as your own
A disappointment to my eyes
A failure in disguise
