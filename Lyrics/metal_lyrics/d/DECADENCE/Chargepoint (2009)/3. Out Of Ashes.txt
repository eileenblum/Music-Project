[Lyrics: Saric]

One of a kind
At the end of time
The wait to ignite
A bird's wish to fly

See it all burn
Like moments in time
Awaken the hushed
That is burning inside

Out of ashes
Out of ashes it's born
All that once was
All that has been destroyed

Not to fall
Not to fall for nothing
Instead to stand
To stand for something

Smoldering pain
The hour has come
Rebirth here again
For the quiet one

Spreading the wings
It is time to fly
It's here to behold
One more time

Out of ashes
Out of ashes it's born
All that once was
All that has been destroyed

Not to fall
Not to fall for nothing
Instead to stand
To stand for something

It's time to heal
Time to see it clear
The strength from the nest
Given by its parents

And the next day
Forgotten the rest
Moves on, only thinks
To fly far away

Out of ashes
Out of ashes it's born
All that once was
All that has been destroyed

Not to fall
Not to fall for nothing
Instead to stand
To stand for something

Ash to dust - dust to rust
It goes and never returns
Ash to dust - dust to rust
See it all burn down to the ground
