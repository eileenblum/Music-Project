[Lyrics: Saric]

Time wants me to show it what I'm fighting for
All I want to give to this world before I'm gone

It's the fight for what is worth
It's the fight for self control
It's the fight for strength of mind
It's the fight to survive

When the will is weakening
And the strength is leaving me
Life to me is threatening
With a constant fight to live

Finally I realize
It's what I do and not what I try
Facing the fact that I'm on my own
Accepting this path I must walk alone

No need to tell me
what I should be fighting for
I'm fighting the day
and I'm going to win my war

It's the fight for what is worth
It's the fight for self control
It's the fight for strength of mind
It's the fight to survive

When the will is weakening
And the strength is leaving me
Life to me is threatening
With a constant fight to live

Finally I realize
It's what I do and not what I try
Facing the fact that I'm on my own
Accepting this path I must walk alone

Do not follow

When the will is weakening
And the strength is leaving me
Life to me is threatening
With a constant fight to live

Finally I realize
It's what I do and not what I try
Facing the fact that I'm on my own
Accepting this path I must walk alone

Do not follow
Fight for yourself
