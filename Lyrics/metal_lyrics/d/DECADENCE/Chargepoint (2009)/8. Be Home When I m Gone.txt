[Lyrics: Saric]

Walking by, all to me is known
Greeting with a smile, everything is common
A sound breaks the stillness, toward it we go
The whistle blow is what everyone is headed for

In a flash, running like the wind
Everyone wishing they were part of it
All I ever wanted
To know where the train departs
And if it was destined to lead me out

Knowing everyone, every stone but feeling alone
Those who jumped on never came home
The thought pulls me in even though I know I shouldn't go
But still I wonder if they found what they were looking for

In a flash, running like the wind
Everyone wishing they were part of it
All I ever wanted
To know where the train departs
And if it was destined to lead me out

This peaceful place, so secure, so safe
But all of it consumes me while I'm dreaming away
Let's walk out again to see the running train
It is where I should be, where I should go and where I want to stay

In a flash, running like the wind
Everyone wishing they were part of it
All I ever wanted
For you to be home when I'm gone
And to know you will be here when I come back
