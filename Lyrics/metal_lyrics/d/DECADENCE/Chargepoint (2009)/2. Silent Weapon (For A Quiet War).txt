[Lyrics: Saric]

Being through one too many battles
And now it looks like nobody cares
Everything is covered by broken walls
A piece of myself smothered in despair

The sight of it pushes me to the point
To stretch the limits with blinds on
As a horse pulling the chariot
Galloping into war

Creeping poison

A silent weapon
For a quiet war
Things changed
Will never be as before
A silent weapon
For a quiet war
Voice will be silenced
As never before, never before

Carrying the weight of the world
On worn out shoulders
Wrapping, climbing plants forcing all down below
Restraining me to let the wild grow

Frustration, hesitation, pressure choking me
Suffocation, I cannot breathe
Once standing proud, shining like a star
As I reach out it's always too far

Creeping poison

A silent weapon
For a quiet war
Things changed
Will never be as before
A silent weapon
For a quiet war
Voice will be silenced
As never before

Quiet war conquering all of me
Undyingly it is killing me
Never before did this pain feel so unbearable
Hidden predator

Creeping poison

A silent weapon
For a quiet war
Things changed
Will never be as before
A silent weapon
For a quiet war
Voice will be silenced
As never before
