[Lyrics: Saric]

Unbearable heat is now all around me
Dear friend will this agony come to an end?
I can keep looking back but I will never more see
What we saw then about what could be

Perfection is achieved not when there's nothing add
But when there's nothing left to take away
Though they always look for someone to be given the blame
And they always remember my name

The ultimate discharge
I will now set it free

Nothing more to put out of sight
Nothing more to hide from you
Nothing more to hold tight
I have nothing left to lose

Away from the shadows I flee
Always running in my dreams
That is why I write to you
To stop this scream
Always haunting

Waiting for the right time
has always kept me waiting
I have to do it alone to have it done
Life giving me nothing but further hating
Why is the pain not gone?

The ultimate discharge
I will now set it free

Nothing more to put out of sight
Nothing more to hide from you
Nothing more to hold tight
I have nothing left to lose

Away from the shadows I flee
Always running in my dreams
That is why I write to you
To stop this scream
Always haunting

It is all in pieces, all coherence gone
Dynamic pulse consumes all
Battering, hammering, charge point giving forth
One final breath, draw in (the discharge)

Is there some way to cure an impossible disease?
Just do it with an impossible cure
The answer of the young boy to the wise man
Completion by the power to endure

The ultimate discharge
I will now set it free

Nothing more to put out of sight
Nothing more to hide from you
Nothing more to hold tight
I have nothing left to lose

Away from the shadows I flee
Always running in my dreams
That is why I write to you
To stop this scream
Always haunting
