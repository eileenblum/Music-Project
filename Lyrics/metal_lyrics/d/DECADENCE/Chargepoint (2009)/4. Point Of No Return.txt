[Lyrics: Saric]

The piercing call commands a frantic hunt
The trigger's been pulled
There's no turning back
and it's what I must do

And not what I want
Nausea by the taste of exertion
And pressure to carry on
Every move is a game with future
And I must bet it all

Craving, wanting more
Instinct says it's time to go
I am what I am
And what I always will be

Point of no return
Is what's been reached
Point of no return
Point of no return
Is what's achieved
Point of no return

To have unlimited odds to lose
Against one chance to win
Makes the only right answer to become
Without hesitation bet it all

Adrenalin rush fills the will to stay
Deadly temptation
Looking around in the moment thinking
Just one more day

Craving, wanting more
Instinct says it's time to go
I am what I am
And what I always will be

Point of no return
Is what's been reached
Point of no return
Point of no return
Is what's achieved
Point of no return

I wake up now to a brand new day
The only thing to bring me up is hate
I feel this sorrow I have now
As useless as anger

Craving, wanting more
Instinct says it's time to go
I am what I am
And what I always will be

Point of no return
Is what's been reached
Point of no return
Point of no return
Is what's achieved
Point of no return
