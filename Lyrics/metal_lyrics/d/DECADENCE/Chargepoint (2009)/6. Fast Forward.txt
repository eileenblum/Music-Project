[Lyrics: Saric]

Once again rising from the dirt
To hit back more than before
Marching in line, those who lasted time
To grasp an ounce of life

This time is different than before
This time we walked out on our own
Something inside screams to be pleased
Wanting to be unleashed

Fast forward
Fast forward - Marching again
Fast forward
Fast forward we go

Marching into the flames
I am marching into the flames

Preparing for more, running into war
With the belief of being strong
A mental preparation for something unknown
No feelings to be shown

Although conquered by a strange fear
Knowing death is certain
Only not knowing when, why, who and where
Adrenalin is pumping

Fast forward
Fast forward - Marching again
Fast forward
Fast forward we go

Marching into the flames
I am marching into the flames

Forward
Forward
Forward
Don't look behind
Forward
Forward
Forward
Stay in line
Forward

Fast forward
Fast forward - Marching again
Fast forward
Fast forward we go

Marching into the flames
I am marching into the flames
