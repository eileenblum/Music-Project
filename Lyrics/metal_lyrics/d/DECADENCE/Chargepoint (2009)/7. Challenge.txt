[Lyrics: Saric]

The noose of depression tightens its hold
Wants me to see no other way
Frustration returns to tell me what it's always told
Control it, repress it and hate it away

This is where I draw the line
Staring fear straight in the eye

Lost in heavy mist
(Challenge)
Overpowered point to resist this chance
I will choose this way
(Challenge)
And I'm dead sure
This moment I know I will not regret

Tempted to drive faster than I can see
Blurring everything but my goal
The long empty road is calling for me
Hell, I no longer care and I won't hold back anymore

This is where I draw the line
Staring fear straight in the eye

Lost in heavy mist
(Challenge)
Overpowered point to resist this chance
I will choose this way
(Challenge)
And I'm dead sure
This moment I know I will not regret

The hour has struck and I am prepared
Going where I've never been
I see this as I am the one who's been dared
I'll take it, I'll do it, I'll kill it, I'll win

This is where I draw the line
Staring fear straight in the eye

Lost in heavy mist
(Challenge)
Overpowered point to resist this chance
I will choose this way
(Challenge)
And I'm dead sure
This moment I know I will not regret, regret, forget, upset, reset
What you give is always what you get
