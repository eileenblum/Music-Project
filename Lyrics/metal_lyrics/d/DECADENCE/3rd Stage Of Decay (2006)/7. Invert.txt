This twisted fate, I found my hate
Is this the deep revelation?
I was meant to set myself free
But my hate was cheating me

Fearless, low kind
Inverted, you and I
Desire, in sight
Wanting your life

Pain, thirst to satisfy
Feeding on the taste of life
Wanting you to embark
Welcoming you to the dark

The day is young, though I am not
Thoughts of decay and encrusted rot
I always give, you always take
I bet you love to see me pay

Fearless, low kind
Inverted, you and I
Desire, in sight
Wanting your life

Pain, thirst to satisfy
Feeding on the taste of life
Wanting you to embark
Welcoming you to the dark

Come to me

The endless hours, the timeless days
The things I've done are now a haze
Just analyze, observe and see
Use my dead eyes; be me

Fearless, low kind
Inverted, you and I
Desire, in sight
Wanting your life

Pain, thirst to satisfy
Feeding on the taste of life
Wanting you to embark
Welcoming you to the dark
