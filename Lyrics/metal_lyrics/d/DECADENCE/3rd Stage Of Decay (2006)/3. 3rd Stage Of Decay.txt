With my eyes you look at me
You will see what I see, day by day
You hide as I look away
I see you, you watch me, our eyes meet

Observing your every move
Alone here you and I, days go by
No persona to despise
No one here hears us cry anymore

Thought, chaotic by nature
Ordered when it's crumbling away
The curtain is now opened to show
The 3rd stage of decay

The power it holds inside
Filled with passion that has died
Who are you to tell me
What my eyes should see?

I look at your eyes again
In the shade, I see the dead ringer
Laughing at my suffering, follow me
You who cry at my pain

The one who is taking control
Living through your breath, having it all
Feeling what you feel within
The creation which I've lead to ruin

Thought, chaotic by nature
Ordered when it's crumbling away
The curtain is now opened to show
The 3rd stage of decay

The power it holds inside
Filled with passion that has died
Who are you to tell me
What my eyes should see?

Breathing out a decadent sigh
You and I are confined in this room
Not losing sight of ourselves
Together forever our own slaves

I want to see your smashed face
Shattered like the pieces building up life
Gathering pieces as one, cutting you
Bleeding me through your skin

Thought, chaotic by nature
Ordered when it's crumbling away
The curtain is now opened to show
The 3rd stage of decay

The power it holds inside
Filled with passion that has died
Who are you to tell me
What my eyes should see?
