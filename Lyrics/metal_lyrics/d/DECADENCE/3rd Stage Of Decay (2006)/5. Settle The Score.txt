Where is god in suffering?
The die is cast, may vengeance yield me
Only a man who's felt despair
Feels what life's really bringing

Life is a war, leaves you all torn
Drew me out of nothingness
It made me be what I am now
Incapable of feeling bliss

Now it's time to settle the score
The string chokes me more
The farther I fall the more I see
The farther I sink the safer I feel

I'm here to prove I'm worthy to
Be the one to challenge you
I can now stop trying
I can see you dying

The hope destroyed, the spirit crushed
Think it could end with a killing
Abandon life, a smile in me
You will lose and I'll win

So be it; I will stay
I must distract my thoughts
What makes you be is what you see
When you know, you will show me

Now it's time to settle the score
The string chokes me more
The farther I fall the more I see
The farther I sink the safer I feel

I'm here to prove I'm worthy to
Be the one to challenge you
I can now stop trying
I can see you dying

The pain, it remains
Forever scarring my strung out face
Bitter taste, strong appetite
I must bring myself back to life

And now, farewell to suffering
Substituted myself
The past is gone; the present's come
A phoenix risen from the dead

No need to hear what they all say
Release is what awaits me
I cannot feel; won't leave it be
Never, never again

Now it's time to settle the score
The string chokes me more
The farther I fall the more I see
The farther I sink the safer I feel

I'm here to prove I'm worthy to
Be the one to challenge you
I can now stop trying
I can see you dying
