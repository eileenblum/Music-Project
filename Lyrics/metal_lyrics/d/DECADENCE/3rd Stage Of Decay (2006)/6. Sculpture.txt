Here I am again on the brink of destruction
Lost all senses of comprehension
What I have seen is cold reality
The stage has frozenb but still approaching

Death takes its toll on me
Mind decay
Disminded energy
Haunted by yesterday

Don't want my soul to bleed
Senses astray
Lost sanity
Time to pay

Hidden in this world that was made for me
Standing alone, I am freezing
The door is locked now, I'm trapped in me
One-way path and a missing key

Chaos in my mind, I am lost in thought
Never an end, why won't it stop?
A sculpture ideal to be perfect in all ways
But what I see is a statue with no face

Death takes its toll on me
Mind decay
Disminded energy
Haunted by yesterday

Don't want my soul to bleed
Senses astray
Lost sanity
Time to pay

Hidden in this world that was made for me
Standing alone, I am freezing
The door is locked now, I'm trapped in me
One-way path and a missing key

Looking down at the past forgotten
Undying memory of what was and that should have been
You're not the fear, it's me

Is there something here that is pulling me back?
Did I lose myself in this attack?
Arranging my mind's complex thoughts
To be released from this predestined loss

Death takes its toll on me
Mind decay
Disminded energy
Haunted by yesterday

Don't want my soul to bleed
Senses astray
Lost sanity
Time to pay

Hidden in this world that was made for me
Standing alone, I am freezing
The door is locked now, I'm trapped in me
One-way path that no one can see
